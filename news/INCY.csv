0,INCY,"Eli Lilly (LLY) topped the Street's first-quarter estimates Tuesday on unexpected strength from two diabetes drugs and the early impact of a chemotherapy tie with Dow Jones' component Merck (MRK).But sales of psoriasis drug Taltz, a key growth product, and osteoporosis drug Forteo lagged expectations on ""wholesale and retail buying patterns,"" Lilly said in a press release. Still, the firm boosted its 2018 guidance after the first-quarter beat.Evercore analyst Umer Raffat characterized it as a ""good quarter for Lilly.""In early trading on the stock market today, Lilly shares ticked down 0.1% to close at 80.09.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFor the first quarter, Lilly reported adjusted profit of $1.34 per share on $5.7 billion in sales, rising a respective 9% and 37%. Both metrics topped the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for adjusted income of $1.13 a share on $5.52 billion in sales.For the year, Lilly raised its adjusted earnings forecast to $5.10-$5.20 a share on revenue of $23.7 billion to $24.2 billion. Analysts expected adjusted earnings of $4.88 per share and $23.46 billion in sales.Late Monday, a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel dealt Lilly and partner Incyte (INCY) a setback. The panel opposed approving a new rheumatoid arthritis drug at a higher dose, as the drugmakers wanted. The panel did favor a lower dosage.During the quarter, sales of diabetes drug Trulicity grew 82% to $678.3 million worldwide. In the U.S., Trulicity revenue advanced 78% on higher demand for drugs in its class, known as GLP-1 receptor agonists. At the same time prescriptions for Trulicity grew 71%, Raffat said.""This implies that pricing has not been unfavorable in the GLP-1 class,"" he said.Humalog, another diabetes drug and Lilly's biggest product, grew 12% to $791.7 million in sales. Better pricing drove that growth, Raffat said.Sales of erectile dysfunction drug Cialis seem to be relatively stable in light of generic competition for Pfizer's (PFE) Viagra. In the U.S., Cialis sales grew 6%, ""driven by higher realized prices, largely offset by decreased demand due to the entry of generic sildenafil,"" Lilly said. Worldwide sales fell 7%.Meanwhile, sales of chemotherapy medication Alimta increased 2% to $499.6 million. A 3% decrease in revenue outside the U.S. was offset by an 8% rise in U.S. sales. Alimta is used in combination with Merck's Keytruda to treat lung cancer.But several key drugs fell short, Raffat said.In the U.S., sales of psoriasis treatment Taltz fell by $31.3 million quarter over quarter, ""driven by lower volume due to specialty pharma buying patterns, partially offset by higher demand,"" Lilly said. U.S. sales of $111.2 million missed by $48 million, Raffat said.""This is an important growth product and (it) missed,"" he said.At the same time, U.S. sales of osteoporosis drug Forteo declined 31% to $122.1 million ""due to decreased volume from wholesale and retail buying patterns, and, to a lesser extent, lower realized prices,"" Lilly said.RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

1,INCY,"NewLink Genetics (NLNK) toppled Monday after it scrapped a late-stage study of its immuno-oncology drug in combination with drugs from Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).In early trading on the stock market today, NewLink shares plunged 7.7% to close at 4.13, and at one point dropped to 3.75, their lowest-ever point. The stock traded near 60 three years ago. Meanwhile, Merck rose 2.6% to finish at 58.65, and Bristol sank 7.8% to 54.08, on other study results.NewLink said it won't test its drug, indoximod, in regimens with Merck's Keytruda or Bristol's Opdivo in patients with advanced melanoma. The decision comes after a study of Keytruda and Incyte's (INCY) rival drug epacadostat failed in that group of patients.Both indoximod and epacadostat are immuno-oncology drugs known as IDO inhibitors. These drugs interact with a specific enzyme to help a patient's immune system fight cancer. Analysts had expected Merck and Incyte's failure to reverberate through the immuno-oncology stocks.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNewLink also tested indoximod with radiation and chemotherapy in children with progressive brain tumors. The first group of 29 patients had already undergone numerous prior treatments. Of those, 17 were able to receive radiation on top of the indoximod-chemo combination.In follow-up, cancer didn't worsen for a median 6.2 months. Eventually, the regimen stopped working in patients at a median 11.7 months.""These early data, though from a small cohort of pediatric patients, demonstrate the potential of the indoximod plus radio-chemotherapy combination without an increase in toxicity for these children,"" spokesperson Theodore Johnson said in a prepared statement.NewLink then tested the regimen in six newly diagnosed patients. Physicians saw improvement in five out of six patients. In one, the tumor almost disappeared.RELATED:How Much Money Do You Need To Start Investing?Long-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFsNew Option Strategy Limits Risk Around Earnings

2,INCY,"Incyte (INCY) plummeted Friday after a regimen that combines its immuno-oncology drug with another from Merck (MRK) failed in a late-stage study, prompting the duo to scrap the program.Raymond James analyst Reni Benjamin minced his price target on Incyte to 85 from 159, noting other combinations using Incyte's drug epacadostat with immuno-oncology drugs from Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and AstraZeneca (AZN) are also likely to be duds.""In our view, this event taints the entire epacadostat franchise and therefore we are removing all revenues associated with melanoma and other indications from our models,"" he wrote in a report to clients. The study ""missed big time.""Shares of Incyte crashed by 22.9% to close at 64.02 on the stock market today. Incyte hit a two-year low, falling as much as 23.2%. Merck, a Dow Jones component, saw shares fall 2.2%, to 53.36. In sympathy, Bristol lost 2.3% to 60.88. AstraZeneca, though, lifted a fraction to 35.42.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe regimen failed to improve progression-free survival in melanoma patients, and looked unlikely to have an impact on overall survival, Incyte said in a news release. The combination tested epacadostat, which inhibits the IDO1 enzyme, with Merck's Keytruda, a PD-1 protein inhibitor.Data from the study will help contribute to the overall understanding of IDO1 inhibition in combination with a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, Incyte Chief Medical Officer Steven Stein said.""We remain dedicated to transforming the treatment of cancer and will continue to explore how IDO1 inhibition and other novel mechanisms can potentially improve outcomes for patients in need,"" he said in a written statement.Safety from the combination was in line with previous studies, Incyte said. Patients will move off the regimen ""in a manner consistent with the best interests of each patient.""Incyte is also testing epacadostat in lung cancer patients in combinations with Merck, Bristol and AstraZeneca. Investigators are also looking at epacadostat regimens in kidney, head-and-neck and bladder cancers.Analysts had been bullish on Incyte's chances with epacadostat. Broadly, they theorize that combining immuno-oncology drugs could offer a more potent cancer response.Bristol has been at the forefront of combining immuno-oncology drugs. Its Opdivo, another PD-1 inhibitor, and Yervoy, which is known as a CTLA-4 inhibitor, are approved to treat melanoma. Bristol is also testing the regimen in other cancers.Merck, on the other hand, has worked to combine Keytruda with chemotherapy. U.S. regulators approved the combination as a first treatment for advanced lung cancer. Merck is also studying Keytruda with another investigational PD-1 inhibitor called MK-3475.On Friday, analysts were less bullish on Incyte's shot with epacadostat, but do see some value for Incyte's other drugs including baricitinib, a rheumatoid arthritis drug with Eli Lilly (LLY), and cancer drug ruxolitinib, branded as Jakafi and Jakavi.Raymond James' Benjamin kept his outperform rating on Incyte. He sees Incyte's Jakafi generating $2.5 billion to $3 billion by 2027. It also has the potential to book significant royalties from baricitinib as well as ruxolitinib outside the U.S., which is also sold by Novartis (NVS) as Jakavi.RBC analyst Brian Abrahams chopped his price target on Incyte to 75 from 114, completely discounting epacadostat. He still has an outperform rating on the stock. Like Raymond James' Benjamin, he still sees some value for Jakafi and baricitinib. But he expects Incyte to terminate other epacadostat studies.""Only silver lining in our view is that (the) results were unequivocal and should make future decisions clear,"" he said in a note. ""Based on the data we see very low likelihood any robust signals in biomarker-defined subgroups emerge that would support continuing anything other than studies substantially reduced in scope for exploratory purposes.""RELATED:How To Build Long-Term Profits In Stocks?

4,INCY,"Eli Lilly (LLY) is trying to ""leapfrog"" Dow Jones stock Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) with its $1.6 billion acquisition of cancer immunotherapy biotech Armo Biosciences (ARMO), an industry observer said Thursday.Drugmaker Lilly is late to the game in cancer immunotherapy, Brad Loncar told Investor's Business Daily. Loncar runs several biotech stock indexes including the Cancer Immunotherapy Sector Index, which contains Armo. The Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy exchange-traded fund popped 3.6% Thursday.""The leaders are Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb and Roche (RHHBY),"" he said. ""If you're a company that has completely missed the boat and you want to play in this area, you have to do something to try to leapfrog the competition.""Early Thursday, Lilly made its first big move in the cancer immunotherapy space — an area of medicine in which drugs teach the immune system to fight cancer. Lilly said it would pay $50 per share of Armo in an all-cash deal.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseArmo shares rocketed 67% to close at 49.80, as Lilly stock rose 2% to 80.86. Fellow drug stocks, like Merck and Bristol, both rose less than 1%. Roche, which had a failure early in the day in colon cancer, dipped 1.6% to 27.63.Lilly expects the deal to close by the end of the second quarter. Armo, a late-stage biotech, went public at 17 in January and quickly popped. It was a ""hot"" initial public offering, Loncar said, noting that its price early Thursday indicates investors may expect another bid on it.Leerink analyst Jonathan Chang noted that the acquisition price is a 68% premium over Armo's closing price Wednesday. He initiated coverage of the stock with an outperform rating and 50 price target earlier in the year. On Thursday, he downgraded Armo to market perform.""The deal confirms our investment thesis on Armo and, in our view, could read positively to other emerging immuno-oncology stocks,"" he said. ""It is unclear if other bidders will emerge, given (the) short closing date.""The acquisition makes sense as pharmaceutical stock Lilly tries to assert itself in the cancer immunotherapy space, Loncar said. Armo's lead drug, called pegilodecakin, is known as a cytokine. It boosts the strength of drugs known as PD-1 inhibitors, like Merck's Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo.Earlier this year, Bristol validated another cytokine drug called NKTR-214 by paying $1.85 billion upfront to partner with Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) on it. The deal hit a record for an upfront payment in biotech, Loncar said. Now, it's of little surprise that Armo is to be taken out.Loncar has consistently predicted that 2018 would be a big year for biotech deals, mergers and takeouts. The year kicked off with news of Celgene's (CELG) plan to buy Juno Therapeutics and Sanofi's (SNY) bids on Bioverativ (BIVV) and Ablynx (ABLX).But this deal for Armo is a little different, he said.""I think this one would have happened if we were in the middle of a terrible, bear market,"" he said. On the other hand, ""this is also a good example of large companies like Eli Lilly, many of them have not been at the forefront of innovation and they're having to buy into that.""Still, Lilly isn't alone in its trailing position in cancer immunotherapy. Roche, AstraZeneca (AZN) and Pfizer (PFE) all have immuno-oncology drugs, but remain behind Merck and Bristol which are ""on a level of their own,"" he said.The cancer immunotherapy space desperately needed some good news, he said. Earlier this year, Incyte's (INCY) drug, known as an IDO inhibitor, failed in a late-stage combination with Merck's Keytruda in melanoma. Incyte's pain extended to other cancer immunotherapy stocks.Background volatility remains in the cancer immunotherapy space, Loncar said. The key, he said, is that these are all different pieces of technology. The Armo drug is different from the Incyte drug known as epacadostat.""Every news item sets people's moods,"" he said. ""Everybody is down on immunotherapy and thinks it's overrated. Then a deal like this happens and it causes the opposite reaction. Whenever you have an emerging technology like this it's going to be a roller coaster.""RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Tame A Volatile Swing Trade With A Half PositionLooking For The Next Nvidia?

Caterpillar (CAT), Verizon (VZ) and United Technologies (UTX) stirred Dow futures early, as crude oil prices gained and investors dug into the session's long list of earnings results.Dow futures rose 0.6%, as Caterpillar forged a strong early lead, but premarket losses from Travelers (TRV) and 3M (MMM) limited gains. S&P 500 futures advanced 0.7%. Nasdaq 100 futures narrowed their early gains to 0.7%, with Paccar (PCAR) leading. But heavy losses from Incyte (INCY) and Biogen (BIIB) tempered the advance.The Dow has logged four straight declines. The Nasdaq has slipped in the past three sessions and the S&P 500 in two of the past three. The results left all three indexes back below resistance at their 50-day moving averages. The declines also pushed the Dow and S&P into negative territory for the year. The Dow industrials ended Monday down 1% for the year. The S&P 500 carried a 0.1% decline.The Nasdaq holds a 3.3% gain. But both the Dow and the S&P 500 must push past their 50-day lines, as well as into positive territory for the year, in order to put the market's struggling uptrend back on track.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

7,INCY,"Novartis (NVS) spiked to a two-year high Wednesday after crushing Wall Street's fourth-quarter views and reportedly issuing a long-term view that suggests key pharma and oncology drugs will offset generic losses.X For the fourth quarter, Novartis reported core earnings of $1.21 per share on $12.92 billion in sales, up a respective 6% and 2% on a constant-currency basis. Analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research had called for core earnings of $1.16 a share on $12.62 billion in sales.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Novartis had jumped 4.9% to close at 91.44, defying a collective dip in drug stocks. Shares hit their highest intraday point since November 2015.Among its products, Novartis' sales of cancer drug Jakavi grew 33% on a constant-currency basis to $228 million, beating the consensus view for $205 million, RBC analyst Brian Abrahams said in a note to clients. Novartis sells the drug outside the U.S. as Jakavi. Partner Incyte (INCY) sells the drug in the U.S., branded as Jakafi.This ""translates to $46.7 million in fourth-quarter Jakafi royalties for Incyte,"" Abrahams said. ""Jakavi continues to show strong growth in Europe, which we believe could also translate positively to U.S. markets and suggest potential for a Jakafi beat.""Heart drug Entresto had a strong quarter, bringing in $185 million vs. consensus forecasts for $159 million, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez wrote in his morning note. Cancer drug Gleevec also posted a beat with $448 million in revenue vs. broad expectations for $408 million.But plaque psoriasis drug Cosentyx missed with sales of $615 million, trailing the consensus at $626 million, Fernandez said.

8,INCY,"Celgene (CELG), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Incyte (INCY) are worth watching amid a broader market correction that saw biotech stocks lose a collective 8% over the previous five days, an analyst said Tuesday.X Biotech stocks rebounded 1.9% on the stock market today, after diving 3.5% on Monday.BMO Capital Markets analyst Brian Belski said in a note to clients that investors are reaping what they sowed.""For all intents and purposes, the majority of clients, market pundits and especially an increasingly boisterous set of naysayers, have been predicting the bull market's imminent demise since the day after the 2016 U.S. presidential election,"" he said.But that doesn't mean the bull market is dead, Belski said. RBC analyst Brian Abrahams agreed — and sees some ""opportune entry points"" for certain biotechs stocks with data and/or approvals expected in 2018.Things are looking up for Celgene after a few missteps in the second half of 2017 — including a major miss in sales of psoriatic arthritis drug Otezla in the third quarter, Abrahams said. Sales of that drug rebounded in the fourth quarter.""We believe the market cap reduction more than reflected that, and we believe their fourth-quarter numbers and 2018 guidance point to reassuring stabilization of key U.S. Revlimid and Otezla sales,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: A bull market is a good time review your stock-selling smarts because once it begins to stall out of an uptrend, it's too late to catch up. Head to the Investor's Corner to brush up on stock-selling rules.Cancer drug Revlimid is Celgene's biggest drug. Analysts have worried about generic rivals taking sales starting in 2022. To contend with that, Celgene recently announced its plan to acquire the remainder of Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) it didn't already own.Adding Juno to its coffers puts Celgene in the CAR-T space where it will compete against Novartis (NVS) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) — the latter via its acquisition of Kite Pharma. CAR-T therapies teach the immune system to identify and fight cancer.But even without Juno, Celgene looks poised to generate enough cash flow to buy back virtually its entire enterprise value before Revlimid goes completely generic in 2026, Abrahams said.Outside that, Abrahams sees a number of 2018 catalysts including additional data for Revlimid in treating lymphoma and late-stage data for drug luspatercept, with partner Acceleron Pharma (XLRN), in blood disorders.Celgene rose 2.7% to 96.25 on Tuesday.Abrahams says Vertex was ""a victim of bad timing."" Vertex recently reported strong data for its triple-combination regimens in cystic fibrosis. But the data came out just as the broader markets were beginning to turn and the stock fell hard the past two days. But Vertex rebounded Tuesday, rising 2.7% to 159.27.Strong effectiveness from drugs known as VX-659 and VX-445 in two triple regimens heading into Phase 3 studies support the likelihood that Vertex can expand into a tough-to-treat population of cystic fibrosis patients, he said.It also enables ""multiple additional shots on goal and sets a bar that will be difficult to match or beat — and with significant lead time — likely rendering mid-year competitive data from Galapagos (GLPG) (an overhang on Vertex shares) much less impactful.""He raised his price target on Vertex to 200. The macro weakness is masking improved fundamentals, Abrahams argued.Incyte is set to read out data from a Phase 3 trial known as Echo-301 in the first half of 2018. The study combined Incyte's immuno-oncology drug epacadostat with Dow stock Merck's (MRK) Keytruda in late-stage melanoma.Both drugs belong to a class known as immuno-oncology treatments. Epacadostat works to block interactions involving the IDO enzyme in the immune system. Keytruda is called a PD-1 inhibitor, which has a similar interaction with the PD-L1 protein.Instinet analyst Christopher Marai expects the trial will read out positively and could be similar to a regimen of Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) drugs Opdivo and Yervoy. Bristol is also combining these drugs to treat other cancers, including advanced lung cancer.If so, ""epacadostat could become part of the standard of care in metastatic melanoma with broad adoption augmenting current anti-PD-1 use,"" he said in a note to clients. That could lead to peak worldwide sales north of $1 billion in melanoma alone for epacadostat.But RBC's Abrahams says eventually nearly all the value for epacadostat will soon be gone from Incyte's shares. He sees $65 per share for Jakafi, which treats a bone marrow disorder, and $8 per share for Olumiant, a rheumatoid arthritis drug co-developed with Eli Lilly (LLY).This ""suggests downside if upcoming epacadostat data are negative is now likely only about $10 per share, with fundamental upside now potentially more than 50%,"" he said. This ""makes the upside/downside at these levels that much more interesting.""Incyte advanced 3.3% to 88.11 on Tuesday.RELATED:Allergan Pops On Consensus-Topping Quarter, Strong Migraine TrialThese Biotech Stocks Each Dived More Than 20% — Is The Sell-Off Overdone?Can CRISPR And These 3 Small Biotechs Cure 10,000 Diseases?

9,INCY,"Amgen (AMGN) would be better off stringing together small deals, rather than attempting a megamerger with the likes of Celgene (CELG), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) or AstraZeneca (AZN), an analyst suggested Monday.One of the biggest debates on the stock is what Amgen will do with its war chest of cash from tax reform, Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young said in a note to clients. At the end of 2017, Amgen had $41.7 billion in cash and investments. Young sees Amgen having $35 billion in cash.""We think the maximum deal size that Amgen could finance without raising equity would be $40 billion to $50 billion,"" she said. ""Amgen could buy similar amounts of revenue growth significantly cheaper from a series of small cap deals vs. a large cap.""For just $15 billion, Amgen could buy Puma Biotechnology (PBYI), Tesaro (TSRO) and AnaptysBio (ANAB) to achieve a 5% compound annual growth rate from 2019-22 on a pro-forma basis. AstraZeneca would cost $110 billion for the same growth. At $70 billion, Shire would tack on a 4% sales growth rate.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Here, we see Amgen could attain similar revenue growth rates for less than 20% of the upfront capital,"" Young said.Investors also are interested in Amgen's strategy to contend with emerging competition rivaling its biggest drug, Enbrel. In 2017, Amgen's total sales declined 1%. In 2018, Amgen expects total sales to again decline by 2.4% at the midpoint of guidance.Among megamergers, Celgene is most interesting, Young said. Amgen would have to pay $98 billion at a 50-50 split in cash and equity including an addition debt raise of $18 billion. Over 2019-22, Celgene could add 6% and 11% to the top and bottom lines, respectively, on a compound basis.But ""the Celgene financing and Revlimid's controversial intellectual property matters make the deal complex,"" she said. AstraZeneca would also have some interesting revenue synergy, but ""there are significant integration risks"" as AstraZeneca's employee base is three times bigger.In the midcap range, Incyte (INCY) and Alexion are also interesting ""plus they allow for some flexibility to do a few small deals as well,"" Young said. Both would fit nicely with Amgen's hematology unit and require no equity financing.But Incyte is unlikely in the near-term. In the first half of 2018, Incyte and partner Merck (MRK), a Dow Jones component, are set to unveil the results of a trial of their immuno-oncology drugs epacadostat and Keytruda in advanced melanoma.Alexion just had positive data for its next-generation version of its biggest moneymaking drug, Soliris, called ALXN1210. Amgen could buy Alexion for $43 billion, adding 3% and 8% to sales and profit, respectively, Young said.She kept her neutral rating and 194 price target on Amgen. On the stock market today, Amgen lost 3% to close at 182.55, in sympathy with the broader biotech market which fell a collective 1.1%.RELATED:How To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersInvesting Basics: How To Sell A StockLooking For The Next Nvidia?

10,INCY,"Biotech giant Celgene (CELG) offered preliminary fourth-quarter results Monday that looked as if they would come in ahead of analyst estimates for profits, an announcement the company made shortly after it agreed to buy privately held Impact Biomedicines.X Celgene said it expects adjusted earnings of anywhere between $2.00 per share, up 24% from the year-ago figures. Revenue is expected to climbed 17% to $3.483 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected earnings of $1.93 on sales of $3.46 billion.Celgene shares dropped 0.8% to close at 104.18 on Monday.The company said late Sunday it was purchasing Impact Biomedicines with an upfront payment of $1.1 billion. Celgene will make additional milestone payments if Impact's fedratinib wins FDA approval and has strong sales, bringing the total potential price tag to roughly $7 billion.Fedratinib is a potential treatment for myelofibrosis, a type of bone marrow cancer.""Myelofibrosis is a disease with high unmet medical need as the number of patients who are ineligible for or become resistant to existing therapy continues to increase,"" said Nadim Ahmed, President, Hematology and Oncology for Celgene, in a statement announcing the Celgene-Impact deal. ""We believe fedratinib is uniquely positioned as a potential treatment for myelofibrosis and it provides strategic options for us to build leadership in this disease with luspatercept and other pipeline assets.""Impact Bio's founders had sold fedratinib to France's Sanofi (SNY), which gave up development of the treatment in 2013 due to serious side effects. But Impact later bought the rights back.If successful, fedratinib would compete with a similar drug from Incyte (INCY), known as Jakafi.Celgene has had disappointing sales and trials of new drugs recently, while its blockbuster cancer fighter Revlimid faces challenges. Celgene cut its full-year outlook in late October, sending shares plunging. The stock has risen somewhat since then, but only in line with the S&P 500 index.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Why These 3 Biotech Stocks Could Outperform Their Peers In 2018100 Best Stocks Of 2017: This Group Boasted 32Biogen Unlikely To See Spinraza Rival In 2018 As AveXis DelayedWhy These 2 Biotechs Could Outperform Amid 'Hyper-Competition'Beware: Price Wars For Big Pharma, Biotechs On HorizonFive 2017 Stock Winners Have Carved New Bases For New Runs

The drug works to block an interaction in the immune system involving the IDO enzyme that would otherwise prevent an immune response to some cancers.Shares rose as high as 153.15 in March, but ended the year at 94.71 ""as investors have become skittish ahead of the ECHO-301 Phase 3 trial readout for a $13 billion swing in market cap,"" Schmidt said in a note to clients.The ECHO-301 trial is testing Dow stock Merck's (MRK) Keytruda with epacadostat in patients with metastatic melanoma. Keytruda is also an immuno-oncology. It blocks an interaction involving the PD-1 protein to teach the immune system to identify and fight cancer cells.IBD'S TAKE: Of the three, Puma has the best IBD Composite Rating of 43 out of a possible 99, meaning it still underperforms nearly six in 10 stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at better-rated biotech performers.Schmidt recommends owning Incyte into ECHO-301 trial results in melanoma. The trial is expected to read out in the first half of 2018. These results will be key in either validating or disproving IDO inhibition in oncology.""If the trial fails, we think the stock is worth $85, 14% downside to the current valuation,"" he said. ""We think Incyte could trade to $160-plus in a best-case scenario, representing 63% upside. A plausible base case could still mean 23% upside ($120).""The combination is going up against a regimen from Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY). Bristol's drugs Opdivo and Yervoy are approved together to treat metastatic melanoma. Opdivo competes against Merck's Keytruda. Yervoy is another immuno-oncology drug.""If the results are positive, but clearly inferior to the Yervoy combination, we think investors will intensely debate the value of epacadostat in the immuno-oncology treatment paradigm,"" Schmidt said, noting the safety profile of epacadostat could still offer an improvement over Yervoy.Clovis had a volatile 2017, but closed the year up 53%, Schmidt said. A Phase 3 trial of its drug Rubraca as a second treatment in ovarian cancer maintenance showed a strong profile vs. rivals Lynparza and Zejula from AstraZeneca (AZN) and Tesaro (TSRO), respectively.But the stock sold off in the latter half of 2017 on competitive concerns in ovarian cancer. All three drugs belong to a class called PARP inhibitors, which work to block an enzyme tied to several types of cancer.In 2018, Schmidt expects Clovis to take off again. The Food and Drug Administration is expected to approve Rubraca as a second treatment in ovarian cancer maintenance in April. Clovis is also likely to unveil data from a Phase 2 trial in metastatic prostate cancer.""We think the opportunity for PARP inhibitors spans several cancer types, including ovarian cancer, metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, bladder, breast and others,"" he said. ""Clovis is in our view well-positioned with partner Bristol to address these opportunities.""Schmidt sees Clovis getting a third of the ovarian cancer market, and 30%, 50% and 20% of the markets for prostate, breast and bladder cancers, respectively.Clovis is leading its rivals in the prostate cancer market. In the second half of 2018, it's set to reveal the results of a trial dubbed Triton-2 and anticipates filing an application for Rubraca as a treatment in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer in 2019.""We believe metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer represents an initial $1.6 billion U.S. market opportunity, and we conservatively attribute a 25% peak market share to Clovis, which will likely reach the market first,"" he said.Puma ended 2017 up 387% on the back of positive data for its drug Nerlynx in some patients with breast cancer. The FDA approved Nerlynx with a broad label, and data from rival Roche (RHHBY) disappointed in a late-stage trial.All together, it represented a best-case scenario for Puma, Schmidt said. Still, shares trade about 40% below peers ""as investors have become nervous about the launch prospects and peak opportunity for Nerlynx.""""We are positive on Puma since we believe the stock doesn't adequately represent Nerlynx's potential in early-stage breast cancer,"" he said. ""Phase 3 trial results in metastatic patients, as well as potential Europe approval in the first quarter, represent near-term catalysts.""In the first half of 2018, Puma is expected to unveil the results of a regimen of Nerlynx and Genentech's cancer drug Xeloda in some patients with advanced breast cancer who have already undergone two prior treatments.The consensus currently estimates $176 million in Nerlynx sales, below Schmidt's view for $200 million. Physician feedback shows broad use of Nerlynx across various subgroups of patients, he said.RELATED:Biotech Dives After Analyst Slashes Expectations For Cancer DrugWhy These Biotech Stocks Could Be Taken Over In 2018Why Clovis' Good News In Ovarian Cancer Prodded These Rivals Down

18,INCY,"Wall Street is undervaluing the foundation Dow component Merck (MRK) is making with its cancer-fighting drug Keytruda, an analyst said as the annual American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting concluded Tuesday.A veritable star in the growing immuno-oncology market, Keytruda is now approved in the U.S. as a treatment for six cancers, according to its website. And Merck has about 40 ongoing studies that could help expand its approvals, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said in a note to clients.The drug ""can continue to drive the story in a company where we acknowledge the base business is facing pressure and where the non-oncology pipeline is not as robust as we would prefer,"" he wrote.For all its hype, Keytruda isn't Merck's biggest drug — Januvia/Janumet is. But sales of the diabetes drug fell 5% year over year in the first quarter whereas Keytruda revenue grew 134%, leading growth for the company.Keytruda recently grabbed Food and Drug Administration approval for use in conjunction with Eli Lilly's (LLY) Alimta as a first line of defense against advanced lung cancer.IBD'S TAKE: Incyte has been in the headlines this year despite the mixed outlook for the 2017 biotech sector. Get some insight into the company with The New America.Competitive data from the likes of rivals AstraZeneca (AZN), Roche (RHHBY) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) are unlikely to rock the boat for Merck, Divan said.""We believe people are underappreciating the impact the strong foundation Merck is building in the space,"" he said.Merck and its closest rival, Bristol, are also partnered separately with Incyte (INCY) to test out their drugs with Incyte's epacadostat. Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo work to block an interaction involving the PD-1 protein that would prevent an immune system response to cancer.Incyte's epacadostat is what's known as an IDO inhibitor. It works to block an interaction involving a different protein. IDO inhibitors aren't as established as PD-1s, though they made some headlines at the conference. Bristol, too, is working on a similar drug.The ""totality of epacadostat data at ASCO looks compelling,"" Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young wrote in a separate note to clients. Data supported epacadostat in multiple tumors, and responses were seen regardless of genetic markers.Shares of Incyte, though, toppled 1.4% to 122.27 on the stock market today. Young blamed the company's decision to exclude some patient data from effectiveness data but include them for safety. That's because effectiveness data had an October cutoff.""We would always like to see more data, but we think the data set presented at the meeting gave us confidence that we probably shouldn't expect significant variance from the unconfirmed patients,"" she wrote.Young models $3.6 billion in peak adjusted sales and $6.7 billion in peak unadjusted sales for epacadostat.Meanwhile, AstraZeneca remains confident in its immuno-oncology combos in advanced lung cancer despite ""dampened enthusiasm from investors"" for those specific matches. AstraZeneca is pairing its PD-L1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors in trials.The company also sees its drug Lynparza getting FDA approval as a second line of defense treatment against ovarian cancer. Lynparza is what's known as a PARP inhibitor, which blocks a family of enzymes cancer cells use to proliferate.In this sector, AstraZeneca rivals Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and Tesaro (TSRO).RELATED:Here Are Winners And Losers From Year's Biggest Cancer MeetingDow's Merck 'Clearly Won' Vs.

"
19,INCY,"Dow component Merck (MRK) ""clearly won the battle"" in trials demonstrating cancer treatments over the weekend during the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting, an analyst said Monday.Investment bank Leerink noted combination data with Incyte (INCY) looked strong. Merck's Keytruda and Incyte's still-unapproved epacadostat were combined to treat an array of tumor types. All signs of cancer disappeared for two lung cancer patients who'd already undergone a prior round of therapy.Epacadostat is what's known as an IDO inhibitor. Keytruda is called a PD-1 inhibitor. Both are immuno-oncology drugs that work by blocking specific interactions that would prevent an immune response.But Merck and Incyte were far from alone on the immuno-oncology scene during the annual meeting in Chicago. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Roche (RHHBY), NewLink Genetics (NLNK), Celgene (CELG) and Exelixis (EXEL) are all also looking to combine their drugs for better cancer-busting efficiency.Bristol's Opdivo and Yervoy were combined in advanced lung cancer patients over two years. Data show the combo has little incremental benefit vs. Opdivo as a monotherapy but Yervoy is ""far from dead,"" Leerink analysts say.Opdivo is similar to Merck's Keytruda, whereas Yervoy works to inhibit an immune reaction involving the CTLA-4 protein receptor. Some patients are more susceptible to PD-1 inhibitors due to genetics. But cancer disappeared in 8% of all patients regardless of their genes.Roche is also combining its Tecentriq, which attacks cancer cells that camouflage themselves behind PD-L1 proteins, with NewLink Genetics' IDO inhibitor. The results looked safe and consistent with epacadostat, Leerink analysts said. Overall, 10% of patients had a response. The data are still new.IBD'S TAKE: Keep track of the biotech industry by bookmarking IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News page.Bristol is also working on emerging immuno-oncological targets in combination trials to treat multiple tumor types including one that could rival Incyte's epacadostat. Bristol, though, is partnered with Incyte on several ongoing trials.Outside immuno-oncology alone, companies like Tesaro (TSRO) are combining what are called PARP inhibitors with PD-1 inhibitors like Merck's Keytruda, an Evercore analyst said. In that vein, half of ovarian cancer patients responded and the remainder reached disease stability.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, IBD's 432-company Biomed/Biotech industry group was down less than 1%.

21,INCY,"XU.S. stock indexes rallied midday Wednesday on strength in the biomed space.The Nasdaq advanced 0.7%, while the S&P 500 added less than 0.2%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average was barely below the day's break-even line. Volume rose on both major exchanges.Biomed stocks showed exceptional strength. In the Nasdaq 100, five of the day's top six gainers were biomed stocks. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) rose 6%; Incyte (INCY), 5%; BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN), 4%; Biogen (BIIB), 3.5%; and Celgene (CELG), 3%.Celgene broke out of a consolidation, clearing a 127.74 buy point in volume that soared more than 300% above average. The pattern is first stage. Celgene has been consolidating for almost two years. A consolidation that long will push down the Relative Price Strength Rating and that is what has happened with Celgene. The RS rating, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, is 68, which means the stock is lagging about a third of the market in price performance.IBD-style investors will put less emphasis on the RS Rating when it comes from a long consolidation.Celgene's earnings picture is solid. The Street expects earnings to rise 23% this year and 21% in 2018. Pretax margin last year was 50.4%, the best in at least nine years.Blue chips meanwhile were mostly down. Losers led winners by a 4-3 ratio. Intel (INTC) and Caterpillar (CAT) were the day's biggest losers in the 30-stock Dow. Both fell about 1.5%.In the S&P 500, the day's top gainer was CA Inc.

22,INCY,"Stocks clocked a broadly mixed finish Wednesday, as weak oil prices dragged, biotechs rallied and names including CA (CA), Red Hat (RHT) and Winnebago (WGO) turned in some of the day's biggest gains.The Nasdaq climbed 0.7%, while the Dow Jones industrial average drifted 0.3% lower and the S&P 500 ended down 0.1%.Preliminary data showed volume was also mixed, lower on the Nasdaq and higher on the NYSE than at the end of trade on Tuesday.Biotechs were the big story in the Nasdaq, accounting for seven of the top 10 gains among Nasdaq 100 stocks. Incyte (INCY), Biomarin (BMRN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) all gained more than 6%.Also at the top of the Nasdaq, CA surged 13% on news reports that the company was discussing being taken private in a deal with BMC Software. The news was unconfirmed, with Bloomberg quoting unnamed sources who said talks were in early stages.  The gain left shares at a new high, clearing the left side high of a 10-month consolidation.Oil-related stocks turned in 13 of the S&P 500's 20 worst performances of the day.  Oil prices sloughed off 2%, putting West Texas intermediate crude down 5% since Friday as oil hammers away at a fifth straight weekly decline.Caterpillar (CAT) took the worst loss among Dow industrials, down 3% in weak trade.  Nike (NKE) rose 1.8% to take the Dow's top slot, boosted by news that it planned to sell some products directly to Amazon.com (AMZN). For its part, Amazon rose 0.7% in weak trade as investors continued to monitor its rebound from support at its 10-week moving average.The Nike-Amazon news appeared to pressure Foot Locker (FL), which shed 5% in heavy trade, although it did pare back from an initial 11% dive.Earnings reports also played a strong role in Wednesday's action. FedEx (FDX) climbed 2% after delivering better-than-expected results late Tuesday.RV maker Winnebago bolted 14% higher in more than six times its average trade. The Forest City, Iowa, outfit reported weaker-than-forecast fiscal Q3 earnings, but revenue easily topped estimates. The company reported strong performance from its newly acquired Grand Design division. Shares are well up the right side of a six-month-old consolidation and 39% above a May 30 low.Open-source-software developer Red Hat surged 10% on a solid fiscal first-quarter report, snapping shares to a fresh high in massive trade.RELATED: 4 Banks Near Buy Points Ahead of Stress Test: Investing Action Plan No Apple iPhone 8 Sales Expected In September Quarter

23,INCY,"No franchise is safe in 2018 among large-cap biotechs, which are feeling pressure as the Food and Drug Administration speeds approvals for rival branded and generic medicines, analysts said Monday.X The theme is a continuation from 2017, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients.""Despite the near-record number of drug approvals, the large-cap biopharmaceutical sector fell out of a favor with investors, with no names more punished than those with concentrated product portfolios and looming branded or generic competitors,"" he said.Heading into 2018, management confidence is low as revenue trajectories for high-profile products face a slowdown courtesy of payers and competitive pressures. Porges doesn't see the uncertainty lifting in 2018 — and ""possibly not ever.""In 2017, competitive pressures slugged the likes of Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD). Celgene is feeling the pain in its inflammation unit amid mounting competition from Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novartis (NVS), as Gilead sees a rival for its hepatitis C drug sales in AbbVie (ABBV).Early next year, Porges expects guidance from the lion's share of large-cap biotechs to be conservative. The most stock-moving guidance will come from Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Gilead, he predicted.Alexion is working on a drug dubbed ALXN1210 to treat a pair of rare blood diseases. It's also undergoing a restructuring. Meanwhile, Gilead's hepatitis C franchise will again come under the microscope even as it attempts to pivot further into HIV with its drug bictegravir.""We believe there is $16 per share of value in Gilead's stock for hepatitis C, and the stock price could move up or down 5% if hepatitis C revenue guidance meaningfully differs from the consensus $5.5 billion to $6 billion estimate,"" Porges said.IBD'S TAKE: Small-cap biotechs performed well in the third quarter, but large-caps suffered mounting competitive concerns. See how that translated in the stock prices by visiting the Industry Snapshot.He noted AbbVie's plans for hepatitis C products are likely to hurt Gilead stock. AbbVie recently launched Mavyret to treat all six genotypes of hepatitis C. AbbVie will likely provide guidance on its fourth-quarter call ahead of Gilead.Porges expects 2018 sales outlooks from Celgene, Alexion, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), Gilead, Amgen (AMGN) and AbbVie to miss analyst estimates. Biogen (BIIB) could provide an outlook that encompasses analyst views, he said.Later in the year, the large-cap universe will face political pressure, Porges predicted.""By midyear the congressional midterm elections will be underway, and these campaigns are likely to renew the focus on pharmaceutical companies and their pricing policies,"" he said. ""We continue to favor stocks of companies that are structural demand growth stories, with products protected by commercial, scientific, clinical or legal barriers to entry.""For 2018, his top picks are Vertex and Alexion.Another Leerink analyst, Michael Schmidt, pegs Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and Puma Biotechnology (PBYI) as his top picks among small- and midsize biotechs focused on treating cancer.This group of stocks has outperformed the broader biotech market by 52% thus far in 2017, Schmidt wrote in a note to clients. This dynamic is set to continue in 2018 in a ""favorable regulatory environment"" and as large caps expand their portfolios via acquisitions.In 2018, Incyte (INCY), Seattle Generics (SGEN), Exelixis (EXEL), Clovis, Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO), Puma and Array Biopharma (ARRY) are set to launch key products. He counts nine in the group set to unveil pivotal trial results and pending regulatory decisions for a total of seven firms.Emerging technologies remain of interest. CAR-T therapy, which trains a patient's immune cells to fight cancer, and precision oncology had a strong 2017. But success in immuno-oncology combinations, cancer vaccines and certain antibodies has only been modest.""We think next-generation antibody-drug conjugates could be an underappreciated re-emerging area of interest in 2018, representing a clinically validated category but with significant room for upside,"" Schmidt said.Antibody-drug conjugates are antibodies linked to cell-killing agents. The antibody binds to specific marks at the surface of a cancer cell. ImmunoGen (IMGN), Mersana Therapeutics (MRSN) and Seattle are working in this area with the latter the furthest along, he said.RELATED:Why Big Pharma And Biotech Companies Are Girding For A Pricing 'Knife Fight'Teva's Restructuring Plan: Another Case Of Been Here, Done That?Generic Drug Makers Face Pricing Issues That Other Pharmas Don't

24,INCY,"Beleaguered biotech investors likely will have to wait until 2018 to get some relief, though trial data and drug approvals could help stoke the embers of the formerly red-hot group.X That's the take from analysts, who say there may be some relief on the horizon. But don't expect anything earth shattering, they say.""The next quarter and a half is likely to feature significant disclosures for a number of companies in our coverage, but is unlikely to be a period of strongly stock-moving events,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a recent note to clients.Porges' view follows a third quarter in which large caps struggled as their historic moneymakers caught the double whammy of increasing competition and pricing concerns. Meanwhile, smaller caps crushed expectations.As a result, IBD's 462-company Biotech industry group, ranked first just a month ago, is now listed as No. 37 out of the 197 groups IBD tracks. Shares touched a 22-month high in October, but have since lost nearly 6%.""However, the flow of events is set to accelerate in early 2018, and the first quarter offers more opportunities for meaningful value inflection across biopharmaceutical companies and stocks,"" Leerink analysts wrote in a recent note.Despite frustration depressing biotech stocks, the group has posted an impressive number of new approvals this year, JMP Securities analyst Mike King said. According to the Food and Drug Administration, 140 original applications for drugs and biologics have been approved this year.""You need product approvals,"" he told Investor's Business Daily. ""Even the most jaded observer of the sector would have to say the sector as a whole has produced very satisfactory results when it comes to major trial readouts. I don't see any change in that regard.""Tacking on drug approvals and successful data readouts will be key for companies like Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), a pair of large biotech leaders facing a growing field of competitors for their moneymakers Revlimid and hepatitis C drugs, respectively.Celgene is set to have two readouts in a type of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and could have CAR-T developments from partners Bluebird Bio (BLUE) and Juno Therapeutics (JUNO). CAR-T drugs treat cancer using a patient's own re-engineered immune cells.Both are important for Celgene, which has long enjoyed revenue gains from chemotherapy Revlimid. Analysts had been expecting generic competition from Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) in 2020. Recently, though, Dr. Reddy's missed a key deadline to file its generic.Still, it's less than ideal for Celgene to rely so heavily on one stream of revenue, FBB Partners analyst Mike Bailey said. Celgene had been preparing to replace some of its patent-challenged Revlimid sales with a Crohn's disease drug. But the firm said in October it won't initiate Phase 3 trials of that drug.""The bull case on Celgene previously was that they had these new drugs to limit the risk for Revlimid,"" he told IBD. ""If you take away the risk management piece, all of the focus is on this one drug which is going to go generic at some point.""Similarly, Gilead has an HIV combination using its drug bictegravir set to gain potential approval in February. This could accelerate HIV sales starting in the second quarter, Porges said. At the same time, ARK Invest analyst Manisha Samy says Gilead will likely get further into CAR-T in 2018. Gilead also announced Thursday its $567 million acquisition of Cell Design Labs, a privately held CAR-T player.In October, Gilead acquired Kite Pharma for nearly $12 billion. This followed the FDA's approval of Kite's drug, dubbed Yescarta, to treat large B-cell lymphoma in adults. Due to their individualized nature, CAR-T drugs aren't likely to rake in the same sales as Gilead's now faltering hepatitis C drugs.""But two or three years down the line, that could be a huge revenue maker,"" she told IBD.IBD'S TAKE: Big-caps struggled in the third quarter which isn't surprising considering a patent cliff over the next 10 years is set to hit some $17 billion in annual sales for blockbuster drugs, says one analyst. Head to the Industry Snapshot for more on how biotechs fared in the period.Yescarta won't replace Gilead's hepatitis C franchise at its peak, but it will grow steadily, Bailey said.""My guess is hepatitis C is going to shrink really quickly,"" he said. ""At some point I would expect CAR-T to replace hepatitis C sales, but no way at the peak. That was once-ever in terms of what Gilead did. It will never be that big.""In the next several months, Leerink's Porges looks for AbbVie (ABBV) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) to disclose pivotal trial or regulatory events, while Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) will report more ""value-confirming events.""AbbVie will have data for an anti-inflammatory treatment known as upadacitinib, he said. Those results could add more detail to the evolving landscape of what are known as JAK inhibitors that treat psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis, among a number of conditions.Regeneron is on deck to file the results of its drug Dupixent in asthma. The drug is already approved to treat eczema. The firm could also report data for its eye drug, Eylea, and for its immuno-oncology drug, cemiplimab, in a type of skin cancer.Also, look for Vertex to provide Phase 2 data for two of its triple-pill combinations to treat cystic fibrosis. In total, Vertex is testing four potential regimens to bring into Phase 3 trials. The firm is also likely to gain approval for a two-drug combination in February.In the Big Pharma world, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez says there are few significant stock-moving catalysts left in 2017, but the first half of 2018 will be busy.Dow's Merck (MRK), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and AstraZeneca (AZN) all have immuno-oncology combo results in lung cancer, while Bristol and Merck/Incyte (INCY) are set to deliver results from their regimens in melanoma.Bristol could also offer interim data from a trial of its immuno-oncology drugs Opdivo and Yervoy as a first treatment for lung cancer.Outside those, ""major immuno-oncology catalysts should (thankfully!) be limited,"" he said. There's a high bar on Bristol's interim data, which require nothing short of stopping the study early on extreme effectiveness. That's unlikely, so expectations are probably low, he said.""Nonetheless, an early stop would be a major validation of Bristol's strategy — likely driving the stock up 15% in our view,"" he said. ""Continuation of the study would likely increase concerns over Bristol's strategy and the ultimate success of the study at the final analysis, possibly pushing the stock down 5%-10%.""PARP inhibitors, yet another class of cancer drugs, are set to have trial results as well. AstraZeneca will have results for its drug, Lynparza, as a first maintenance treatment in ovarian cancer.""I think the PARP space will be quite large,"" JMP's King said. ""It's hard to tell in the real world if doctors will see these drugs as better so they can start producing some satisfactory sales figures.""RELATED:Biotechs Sell Off In Droves — Are Investors Seeking Mergers?This Biotech Just Neared A 17-Year High On Strong Cancer RegimenThis Cancer Biotech Is Falling On Its $1.55 Billion Bayer Deal
"
25,INCY,"Incyte (INCY) popped early Tuesday on better-than-expected sales for the third quarter and after it announced an expanded collaboration with AstraZeneca (AZN) that could broaden its opportunity for immuno-oncology drug epacadostat.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Incyte was down 0.9% to 113.25. AstraZeneca rose 2.2% to finish at 34.50.For the third quarter, Incyte reported adjusted income of 17 cents per share on $381.53 million in sales. Adjusted profit declined by 2 cents vs. the year-ago period, but topped analysts' average call for 6 cents. Sales grew nearly 42% and beat the consensus' $360 million view.Sales of cancer drug Jakafi posted a yearly gain of 36% to $304 million, topping analyst views for $287 million. The same drug is sold outside the U.S. by Novartis (NVS) as Jakavi. Incyte brought in $41 million in Jakavi royalties during the quarter, rising nearly 37%.Fellow cancer drug Iclusig tacked on an additional $5.37 million in the quarter to hit $18.1 million in sales, beating the consensus for $16.2 million, Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt wrote in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Incyte is one of six companies to win a Biotech Innovator Award from Investor's Business Daily. Head to the IBD Biotech Innovator Awards page for more on the six companies selected.Incyte boosted its full-year sales view for Jakafi to $1.125 billion to $1.135 billion, up from earlier expectations for $1.09 billion to $1.12 billion. The firm kept its Iclusig net product revenue model for $60 million to $65 million.""Nonetheless, the top end of Incyte's guidance implies flat fourth-quarter vs. third-quarter U.S. sales, perhaps suggesting some one-time factors such as inventory stocking may have contributed to this quarter's strong number,"" RBC analyst Brian Abrahams wrote in a note.Still, Incyte's deal with AstraZeneca could widen the market for epacadostat, which is known as an IDO1 inhibitor. Incyte also has deals to test epacadostat with drugs from Dow's Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), which are known as PD-1 inhibitors.AstraZeneca and Incyte will co-fund a Phase 3 trial of epacadostat and AstraZeneca's Imfinzi, a PD-L1 inhibitor, in patients with advanced lung cancer. The trial will test the regimen vs. Imfinzi alone. Leerink's Schmidt says the trial is expected to begin enrolling in the first half of 2018.PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors belong to a class of immuno-oncology drugs known as checkpoint inhibitors. Drugmakers are betting big their checkpoint inhibitors will pair well with IDO1 inhibitors, like epacadostat.""We do see this as an additional external validation for the promise of epacadostat,"" RBC analyst Abrahams said. ""Given (Imfinzi's) strong efficacy, the bar in this setting is high, but success could broaden the (advanced lung cancer) opportunity.""RELATED:6 Top Biotech Companies In Innovation Earn Recognition In New AwardsIncyte Cancer Treatment Uses Patients' Immune System To Fight DiseaseIncyte Joins Ranks Of Stocks With RS Ratings Over 90
"
26,INCY,"Among the biotech companies chasing next-generation cancer treatments that work with patients' own immune systems, Incyte (INCY) stands out with a treatment analysts say could prove to be a blockbuster.XThe Wilmington, Del.-based company is a leader in developing immunotherapies to bolster cancer survival rates. It stands among drug giants such as Novartis (NVS) and Merck (MRK), with which it has both partnered and competed, as this emerging field of medications rapidly expands.The nonprofit Cancer Research Institute, which funds immunotherapy studies, estimates that some 1,400 drugs using immunotherapies to target cancer were on the market or in the pipeline as of August. That figure more than doubled from just two years earlier.""It's exploded,"" said institute spokesman Brian Brewer. ""The number of drugs and combination of drugs out there now is off the charts."" Among the successes are improved survival rates for patients fighting skin and lung cancers.In the coming decade, analysts say Incyte will be among the companies leading the charge to bring new immunotherapies to market with its still-experimental drug epacadostat, which works in combination with other medications. Recognizing the potential for new epacadostat regimens, along with already robust sales of the company's current flagship cancer-fighting drug Jakafi, Investor's Business Daily named Incyte one of six IBD Biotech Innovator award winners.How IBD Chose The Biotech Innovator Award Winners: IBD asked equity analysts, ETF and mutual fund managers and university professors to identify the top biotech companies based on their innovative research. We asked them to focus on companies with pioneering drugs likely to launch in the next several years and reach blockbuster, or near-blockbuster, sales of $1 billion or more a year. The award winners selected by IBD editors are the six most-cited companies. To find profiles of all the award winners and details of their work, go to our full Biotech Innovators special report.)Morningstar analyst Kelsey Tsai says epacadostat ""showed encouraging early results"" in concert with Bristol-Myers' (BMY) Yervoy to fight melanoma. Incyte's drug is under evaluation with other immunotherapies on this front, including a late-stage study with Merck's Keytruda that also targets melanoma. And additional studies are underway for epacadostat in combination with Keytruda and drugs to treat other oncological diseases.Epacadostat ""has very high potential,"" Tsai told IBD. (Incyte declined to make an executive available to be interviewed for this story.)""Pivotal results"" for the drug in combination with Keytruda are expected in the first half of 2018, Tsai says. And data on early testing for the same regime targeting multiple cancers are expected as soon as this fall.Incyte researchers used past university studies to help develop epacadostat. Key findings showed that cells in tumors take advantage of an enzyme called IDO1 to prevent a person's immune system from killing them off.Epacadostat was designed to target and block this enzyme on and near cancerous cells to enable a patient's immune system to attack and reduce tumors. Analysts say this process is safer than chemotherapy and other treatments because it involves the human body fighting diseases naturally.Credit Suisse sees lofty sales of epacadostat, estimating that annual revenue from the drug could exceed $3 billion as soon as 2025, assuming it wins regulatory approval.Tsai says Morningstar projections assume pricing of $100,000 annually for use of the drug regimens. She said her firm gives epacadostat a 60% chance of gaining approval as a treatment for certain skin- and lung-cancer treatments. Other types of cancers will be targeted later.IBD'S TAKE: It's always best to focus on stocks with Relative Strength Ratings above 90, where Incyte has been among the hierarchy.That promising outlook is on top of already strong oncological drug sales for Incyte. The company's drug for a bone marrow disorder and blood cancer, Jakafi, helped the company generate revenue of $1.1 billion in 2016, five years after the drug gained FDA approval. Incyte posted second-quarter revenue of $326.4 million, up 33% from the year-earlier quarter, on strong Jakafi sales.Tsai said the blend of Jakafi as its foundation and epacadostat as its future puts Incyte ""in a plum spot.""Incyte's stock touched a six-month high above 140 on Aug. 31, but closed Friday at 114.29. In March, the stock set a record high that had dated to 2000, surpassing 153. Revenue jumped by at least 44% a year from 2014 through 2016, and is expected to rise more than 30% this year to near $1.47 billion. The company finally broke into the black in 2015.Its market capitalization tops $23 billion, roughly double its value at the start of 2015.For all the positives, observers note that drug-trial setbacks wouldn't be a shock, and regulatory approval is never a sure thing. Competition is strong and intensifying from a range of companies.""As an investor, unless you are really digging in with your homework in biotech, it can be hard to really know what is going on with drug trials and what kind of timeline things are on,"" Mike Matousek, a trader at investment house U.S. Global Investors (GROW), told IBD.But he and others say Incyte boasts some unique positives.Herve Hoppenot took over as CEO in 2014. He had been Novartis' president of oncology, and he brought cancer-drug experience and several key scientists with him to Incyte.And while competition is heated, the need for cancer treatments is so vast that analysts say there is plenty of room for multiple strong players in this field.Also notable: Analysts say Incyte is the largest of the midsize companies in the oncology arena. As such, analysts say Incyte remains an attractive acquisition target for larger drug companies looking to pick up talent and bolster their drug pipeline. In March, reports surfaced saying Gilead Sciences (GILD) could be eyeing Incyte, though no Incyte takeover rumors have come to light lately. Instead, Gilead on Aug. 28 announced an agreement to acquire Kite Pharma (KITE) for nearly $12 billion.Incyte, though, will likely remain a subject of speculation, analysts say.""The possibility of M&A almost always gives investors added reason to give extra attention to a stock,"" Matousek said.RELATED:Get The Details On All 6 Biotech Innovator Award-Winning Companies And Their WorkIncyte Battles In A $25 Billion MarketPhase 3 Trial Results Boosted This Biotech Stock

27,INCY,"Cure is a strong word when it comes to treating cancer and other deadly diseases, but Brad Loncar is among the biotech stock analysts and investors ready to employ the term.X""For the first time, biotech companies are not thinking about these technologies incrementally,"" said Loncar, portfolio manager of a biotech-focused ETF. ""They're not thinking about alleviating the symptoms of the disease, they're thinking about fixing the genetic mutations that cause the disease.""Loncar was speaking of cancer, but those comments could apply to other terrible diseases that claim thousands of lives, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Lou Gehrig's disease, multiple sclerosis and muscular dystrophy.Thirty-five years after the first FDA-approved biotech drug, the biotech industry is rolling out innovations at a breakneck pace. The new-drug pipeline is bursting with treatments in clinical trials, the industry is growing by leaps and bounds, and many biotech stocks are scoring superior returns for investors.To recognize the biotechnology industry's contributions to science and to patients' health, Investor's Business Daily has created the IBD Biotech Innovator Awards. In this inaugural edition, we name six award-winning U.S. biotech companies, chosen for their groundbreaking treatments recently introduced to the market or well along in the new-product pipeline.The six companies are Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Kite Pharma, Incyte (INCY) and Loxo Oncology (LOXO). The winners aren't ranked in any way; only companies with U.S.-traded shares were considered.All but Biogen have their sights firmly on curing cancer, among other intractable diseases. Biogen is targeting the likes of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and MS.How IBD Chose The Biotech Innovator Award Winners: IBD asked equity analysts, ETF and mutual fund managers and university professors to identify the top biotech companies based on their innovative research. We asked them to focus on companies with pioneering drugs likely to launch in the next several years and reach blockbuster, or near-blockbuster, sales of $1 billion or more a year. The award winners selected by IBD editors are the six most-cited companies. To find profiles of all the award winners and details of their work, go to our full Biotech Innovators special report.)The six companies are just a few of the players in a huge field closely tracked by investors. IBD counts 453 publicly traded companies in its biotech industry group, which doesn't include the many other companies with biotech operations that aren't their main focus. The 453 have a combined market cap of nearly $900 billion and sales for the most recent 12 months of more than $100 billion.Thanks to the biotech industry, the pipeline of new drugs of all kinds has exploded. Clinicaltrials.org counts more than 1,480 drugs filed for Phase 3, or late-stage, trials with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration this year, and the FDA has more than 32,000 late-stage studies registered.IBD's biotech industry stock group has climbed 33% this year, shucking off the pains of the politically charged election season in 2016 and concerns that President Trump will work to lower drug prices. The group on Wednesday hit a 22-month high of 3,128 but is down from its all-time high near 3,900 in July 2015. It currently ranks No. 1 of the 197 groups tracked by IBD in terms of performance in the past six months.Boosting the group's performance are Celgene and Loxo, which recently hit new highs. Incyte touched a record high this year, while Biogen touched a 27-month high on Friday and Regeneron this year touched a nearly two-year high.The biotech-focused fund that Brad Loncar heads up is Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF (CNCR), which tracks 30 biotechs working in immunotherapy. The exchange traded fund is nearing its two-year anniversary and is up 26% this year. His comments to IBD came amid a series of regulatory approvals and acquisitions in cancer treatment, including Gilead Sciences' (GILD) foray into cellular therapy with its August agreement to acquire Kite for nearly $12 billion. (The Kite purchase was completed Oct. 3 and Kite now operates as a wholly owned Gilead unit.)Count Loncar among the bullish. Today, drugs can teach the immune system to identify, fight and precisely target cancerous cells. Technology can turn off or edit genes to correct genetic conditions.Some trial data are ""jaw-dropping,"" he said. One example is CAR-T technology, in which Kite is among the leaders. The field is young, but biotech companies ""are taking patients who have weeks or months to live and, in some cases, are seeing complete remissions,"" Loncar said. ""I've never seen anything like that.""Loncar likens chemotherapy to a bomb — it kills the enemy and everything else in sight. Loxo is using smart bombs. Its precision medicine targets gene fusions in cancer, JMP Securities analyst Mike King explains.In cancer, some genes are called passengers and others drivers, King told IBD. When a driver becomes fused to a normal cell, that normal cell transforms into a cancerous one. Loxo identifies and targets those fusions.At the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference in June, Loxo showed the impact of its work with a photo of a sarcoma protruding from a child's chest, King says. By targeting what's called the TRK fusion, Loxo was able to treat the cancer.The tumor ""shrunk away to nothing without surgery or radiation or any other therapy contributing to it,"" he said. ""It was remarkable. It was pretty staggering even for people in the audience who are kind of used to seeing these kind of things.""Among 50 patients, the drug dubbed larotrectinib was able to partly shrink tumors in 64% of them, with all signs of cancer disappearing in 12% of patients. The drug has breakthrough, rare pediatric disease and orphan drug designations with the FDA.Also grabbing headlines is immuno-oncology work from Dow component Merck (MRK) as well as Incyte, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Roche (RHHBY) and AstraZeneca (AZN). Besides Kite, CAR-T therapy is getting its due from the likes of Novartis (NVS), Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE).Immuno-oncology and CAR-T are both methods of teaching the immune system to fight cancer. Immuno-oncology drugs do so by blocking specific interactions that would otherwise prevent an immune response. CAR-T drugs individualize that process by reprogramming a patient's own extracted immune cells.IBD'S TAKE: CAR-T drugs are snagging major attention after Gilead announced its plan to acquire Kite and Novartis got a major drug approval, opening up the sector for commercialization. Head to the IBD's Industry Snapshot feature for a closer look at the emerging CAR-T sector.Results have impressed, and immuno-oncology drugmakers are taking it a step further by combining their compounds in the hopes of seeing more robust responses. Merck has had success with its drug Keytruda, which has won approval as a first treatment with chemo in lung cancer.Incyte drug epacadostat is particularly intriguing, analysts say. It prevents some interactions involving the IDO enzyme. Merck and Bristol are pairing their drugs Keytruda and Opdivo — both belong to a class of drugs known as PD-1 inhibitors — with Incyte's epacadostat.Regeneron, too, is working on a PD-1 inhibitor, with its REGN2810. It's developing this in partnership with Sanofi (SNY). In June, Regeneron and Sanofi said 46.2% of patients with a form of skin cancer responded to treatment with REGN2810 in a Phase 1 trial.On the CAR-T side, Novartis gained FDA approval in late August for a drug to treat a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients up to age 25. Its approval helped spike Gilead, which just two days before had announced its deal to acquire Kite.Kite is nearing approval for a CAR-T drug to treat an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Juno is just behind with its drug called JCAR017, which would treat the same cancer as Kite's drug. Bluebird is working on a multiple myeloma drug.Juno and Bluebird both have partnered with Celgene on their programs. JMP's King calls it a ""best-in-breed"" approach, where Celgene will put its money on the line for potential innovation.Such partnerships are where Celgene excels, Wedbush analyst David Nierengarten told IBD.  ""They've had these innovative deals across sectors, from small molecules to cell therapy,"" he said. ""They're innovative, and they cast the net widely for new technologies and potential therapies.""Others are reaping the benefits of a decades-old project that mapped the human genome. The first human genome map cost $2.7 billion in 1997 dollars and took almost 15 years to complete. Today, it costs closer to $1,000 to map an individual's entire genetic makeup.Gene therapies and editing are having a ""renaissance,"" JMP's King said. Analysts point to Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP), which made its IPO a year ago, as a leader in this field.Crispr is also the name of the technology. Crispr Therapeutics, Audentes Therapeutics (BOLD) and Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA) also are making waves in the sector. The technology makes it much easier to edit genes, Needham analyst Alan Carr told IBD.BTIG analyst Dane Leone sees some of those companies entering the clinic in 2018.""This technology uses an enzyme that is actually from a bacterial organism to target areas of the genome or your DNA, where you want to make changes to the DNA,"" he said. ""What you can do using this enzyme complex is give it direction in terms of target, and insert it into a cell.""In the end, the enzyme complex attaches to DNA, where it can make alterations, he told IBD.JMP analyst King described Crispr technology as having the ability to ""repair broken genes, cut out and replace defective genes and insert functional genes where they're desired.""On the other side of the gene spectrum, RNA interference and antisense are responsible for cutting-edge drugs from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) and Biogen partner Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS). Biogen and Ionis in December won FDA approval for Spinraza, the first drug of its type approved to treat spinal muscular atrophy.Needham's Carr likened RNA interference as a way of ""turning off"" a gene. This has the potential to be more robust than gene therapy, which must alter all or most of the cells in the body to be effective.In September, Alnylam stock spiked 52% in one day after its drug, patisiran, proved effective in treating a rare disease known as hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. The disease results in the buildup of abnormal protein causing systemic problems. Patisiran uses RNA interference. Analysts call the late-stage data from Alnylam a ""big win"" for the concept.Bluebird is working in gene therapy to treat blood disorders.The list of innovations goes on and on in this era of biotech, but today's gains have been decades in the making.""It's usually a steady build and then you have these waves of innovation that kind of collide or emerge at similar points in time,"" JMP's King said. ""It's not like the traditional tech, where things can happen overnight.""RELATED:Get The Details On All 6 Award-Winning Biotech Innovators And Their WorkGilead-Kite Deal Boosts Biotech ETF As It Clears Buy PointHow Novartis' Cancer Approval Validates Gilead's $11.9 Billion Kite DealThe Cure For Cancer?

30,INCY,"Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and Tesaro (TSRO) could each deliver blockbuster ovarian cancer drugs and grab takeover interest, an analyst said Friday ahead of a key trial for Clovis, expected later this month.The duo rivals bigger AstraZeneca (AZN), whose $87.3 billion market cap is more than eight times that of Clovis and Tesaro combined. Clovis and Tesaro joined AstraZeneca on the PARP-inhibitor market within the last year.PARP inhibitors work by blocking a family of enzymes that cancer cells use to proliferate. Pfizer (PFE) and AbbVie (ABBV) are also working on PARP inhibitors. Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young sees the class of drugs also having an impact in prostate, breast and lung cancers.""We think that the PARP (inhibitor) market is big enough ($8 billion to $10 billion) that Clovis can have a blockbuster product as well,"" she wrote. ""We strongly believe that both companies are likely attractive targets for large global biopharma companies.""Later this month, Clovis is expected to unveil the results of its Phase 3 trial, dubbed Ariel-3, for its drug Rubraca. Tesaro previously set a high bar with a trial of its drug Zejula which had a benefit in all patients regardless of specific genetics.""On a top-line basis, we think Ariel-3 will work across the groups, but the focus will be on potential commercial differences like use of biomarker and safety,"" she wrote in a note to clients.Young expects Tesaro stock to be volatile following Clovis' trial, but notes that it will lift an overhang on shares. She has outperform ratings on both Tesaro and Clovis stocks. She rates Tesaro stock with a 198 price target and Clovis with an 88 price target, up from 74.On the stock market today, Clovis stock rose 0.45% to 59.97. Tesaro stock gained 0.1% to 144.31. AstraZeneca, Pfizer and AbbVie stocks were up 1.4%, 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively.IBD'S TAKE: The American Society of Clinical Oncology laid out the battlefield fighting cancer. Companies like Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Incyte and Roche are working on combining drugs on the immuno-oncology spectrum. Get more at IBD Industry Themes.Shares of fellow cancer biotech Incyte (INCY) toppled 1.9% to 118.05, after sustaining a price-target cut. Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt trimmed his price target on Incyte stock to 129 from 134 after Incyte and Eli Lilly's (LLY) rheumatoid arthritis treatment was delayed in the U.S.In April, the Food and Drug Administration delayed approval for the drug, called baricitinib, instead asking for more information into a trial. Now, Schmidt says he expects $400 million in 2026 sales, down from $1.3 billion. He sees the drug launching in 2020.But, Schmidt was bullish on Seattle Genetics (SGEN) stock after the small biotech and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) unveiled strong data for a combination of their drugs Adcetris and Opdivo in classical Hodgkin lymphoma. All signs of cancer disappeared in 63% of patients.A series of trials for the combination could ""potentially provide a chemotherapy-free treatment option"" for patients whose Hodgkin lymphoma either relapsed or can't be treated with surgery.Schmidt has outperform ratings on Seattle Genetics and Bristol-Myers stocks.RELATED:Tesaro Crashes Despite Beating AstraZeneca With 'Stronger' DataBristol-Incyte Match Beats Dow's Merck In Combination TrialsConference Spotlights Drug Giant Donnybrooks In Cancer Treatments

31,INCY,"French drugmaker Sanofi (SNY) is reportedly considering a bid for Tesaro (TSRO), but could face some competition from Gilead Sciences (GILD), whose frustrated hepatitis C franchise has left the massive biotech thirsty for an acquisition.At the close on the stock market today, Tesaro was up 2.8% to 142.67. Gilead stock popped 1.1% to close at 65.43. Sanofi stock, though, was down 1.3% to close at 47.57.According to insiders cited by StreetInsider, Sanofi is looking to put in a bid on Tesaro, which reportedly began seeking takeover bids last month following the approval and launch of its ovarian cancer drug, Zejula.Gilead is also likely in the running to buy Tesaro, according to reports. Gilead's two biggest drugs to treat hepatitis C, Sovaldi and Harvoni, saw sales dive in 2016 on high cure rates. Now, Gilead has said it's interested in making a deal, particularly one in oncology.But it won't be cheap. Insiders say it'll cost $10 billion (or $185 per share) to acquire the $7.6-billion-market-cap Tesaro. The winner will also get its hands on ovarian cancer drug Zejula, which launched earlier this year with a $118,000 per-year price tag.At that cost, Zejula is less expensive than AstraZeneca's (AZN) Lynparza and Clovis Oncology's (CLVS) Rubraca. And of the three, Zejula's label is broadest, allowing treatment of ovarian cancer patients regardless of specific genetics.IBD'S TAKE: Tesaro stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 52, meaning it outperforms just above half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Visit IBD Stock Checkup for a look at better-rated stocks in the biotech sector.Analysts have speculated that the competitive landscape in what's known as PARP inhibitors — which includes Zejula, Lynparza, Rubraca and a non-approved drug from Pfizer (PFE) — could change as more data from rivals become available this year.Sanofi has struggled to make deals in recent history. Last year, it lost out to Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in a battle for Actelion Pharmaceuticals, and to Pfizer which got its hands on a PARP inhibitor by acquiring Medivation.Gilead, too, is in a position to hunt for deals. Its hepatitis C drugs fell in 2016, and the company said on its most recent earnings call that it will rely on deals for growth, with a special interest in oncology assets. Incyte (INCY) has also been on the radar as a rumored target.Representatives for Tesaro and Sanofi declined to comment to Investor's Business Daily. A representative of Gilead didn't immediately return a request for comment.RELATED:Did AstraZeneca Rival Just Launch A Potential Blockbuster Drug?Why Clovis' Advantage Might Squash Tesaro In Ovarian CancerTesaro Crashes Despite Beating AstraZeneca With 'Stronger' Data

32,INCY,"Gilead Sciences (GILD), on Tuesday, hinted it could be prepping to make an acquisition in oncology after reporting sales from its hepatitis C drug franchise toppled for the second straight quarter.On the late Tuesday quarterly conference call, Chief Executive John Milligan said the firm is ""assessing a number of different opportunities"" that could play out over the coming year, including partnerships and acquisitions.""I think it's pretty clear we're looking for another avenue to increase our opportunity for revenue,"" he said. ""It's clear we have been focusing on oncology, where the question is there in the area, where we can use our resources to accelerate products to market and build a meaningful franchise in oncology.""Wall Street speculation has built over the last several months that Gilead could be considering a deal to buy Incyte (INCY), a small biotech with a promising immuno-oncology drug in clinical trials with drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Merck (MRK), among others. Incyte stock has climbed 23% this year on the rumor.Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young sees the company becoming acquisitive in the near-term.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Biomed/Biotech industry group is comprised of 425 companies. Having trouble keeping up with stock news? Bookmark IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News page.""Investor focus remains on whether the company will do a deal and it sounds like the company is getting mobilized and putting the pieces in place to execute a deal,"" she wrote in a research report. Young kept her outperform rating and 79 price target on Gilead stock.Needham analyst Alan Carr said a deal has the potential to be ""transformative."" He kept a hold rating on Gilead stock, noting shares could be attractive after hepatitis C drug sales stabilize. In the first quarter, the unit saw revenue plunge 65% from a year ago as fewer patients are starting on the drugs.But the HIV business seems strong, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients. Gilead is successfully transitioning patients to tenofovir alafenamide, or TAF, from tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, TDF, drugs. Older TDF drugs are lower priced and exposed to generics.Carr noted 42% of Gilead patients are now on TAF-based treatments for HIV.On the stock market today, Gilead stock lost 2% to 67.21, after earlier touching a two-week low.RELATED:Gilead Topples On Consensus-Lagging Q1 As Hepatitis C Drug Sales PlummetDow's Pfizer Tops Earnings Views, But Sales Come Up ShortHow Gilead Is Paying The Price For Actually Curing A Disease

33,INCY,"Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) is too risky to acquire as Merck (MRK) and Roche (RHHBY) pile on the pressure in immuno-oncology medications, an analyst argued Wednesday as he downgraded Bristol stock to an underperform rating.On the stock market today, Bristol stock was down 1.6% to 55.06. BMO analyst Alex Arfaei attributed the recent move in Bristol stock to near 56 from near 45 in January to takeover speculation.But Pfizer (PFE), an oft-cited potential suitor for Bristol, seems unlikely to make a deal in the near-term, Arfaei said. On Tuesday, during Pfizer's first-quarter earnings call, Chief Executive Ian Read cited macro issues that would make an acquisition difficult.""Pfizer has been, and I expect will continue to be, active industry consolidators,"" he said. ""However, there is a lack of clarity on potential tax reform, health care policies of the U.S. and uncertainties in the European markets with both the French election and the UK snap election.""Arfaei called for increasing uncertainty in Bristol's immuno-oncology franchise this year.Merck's immuno-oncology drug Keytruda will likely get the Food and Drug Administration's approval in combination with chemotherapy to treat advanced lung cancer and, also later this month, Merck is likely to unveil strong data for Keytruda plus Incyte's (INCY) epacadostat in a number of tumors.""We don't expect significant new data from Bristol at (American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting), and the conference itself will likely strengthen our argument that the (immuno-oncology) market will become increasingly fragmented,"" he wrote in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Bristol and Merck are leading the immuno-oncology market. But their days in the sun could be coming to an end. A number of companies are stepping up their immuno-oncology research and offerings. Head to IBD's Technology page for a look at who might rival these two over the coming years.In the latter half of 2017, Arfaei sees Roche's immuno-oncology drug Tecentriq pressuring Bristol in advanced lung cancer. He also expects payers to use data from Bristol to limit the use of its immuno-oncology drugs, Opdivo plus Yervoy, in melanoma.The immuno-oncology battle has pitted Bristol and Merck most directly. Opdivo and Keytruda are both what's known as PD-1 antibodies. They work to block the interaction between an immune system cell and a cancer cell hiding behind a PD-1 protein to help the body identify the cancer.But Bristol has had some wins in the immuno-oncology world recently. Last week, European regulators approved Opdivo as a second-line treatment for squamous cell head-and-neck cancer after platinum-based therapy. The company beat Merck to the approval.Still, Arfaei says Bristol is too reliant on its immuno-oncology drugs which, he estimates, will comprise 50% of sales and 70% of profits by 2021.""Overall, we argue that even if we see positive resolution of the macro factors, given Bristol's overdependence on its (immuno-oncology) franchise and our expectations for increased uncertainty about its potential, a takeout seems unlikely because it is simply too risky,"" Arfaei wrote.RELATED:Did Gilead Just Provide Some 'Incyte' Into A Potential Deal?Bristol-Myers Beats Gilead, Merck To Key Approvals In China, EuropeDow's Merck Tops Views And Raises Outlook, But Key Drug Lags

36,INCY,"Eli Lilly (LLY), Pfizer (PFE) and Novartis (NVS) are pitted in the battle to treat breast cancer, but Wall Street struggled Thursday to compare the effectiveness of their drugs after Lilly unveiled new data.All three drugs belong to a class called CDK4/6, which work to inhibit specific proteins to prevent the over-proliferation of cancer cells. Pfizer's Ibrance was the first approved in this area. But Novartis' Kisqali grabbed approval this year and Lilly's abemaciclib looks promising.In a Phase 2 trial, Lilly's abemaciclib, combined with chemotherapy, increased progression-free survival to a median 16.4 months vs. 9.3 months for a placebo-chemo combo. Hazard ratio, which measures the likelihood of death, was 0.55.Pfizer's drug Ibrance was combined with chemo in an earlier trial. The combo had a lower hazard ratio at 0.46 — meaning there was a lower risk of death — but it only extended progression-free survival to a median 9.5 months vs. 4.6 months in placebo combo.Comparing the two boils down to which Wall Street sees as a ""better"" effectiveness metric, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat wrote in a report. He notes that the trials studied different populations of breast cancer patients, making an apples-to-apples comparison tricky.Still, diarrhea remains a concern for Lilly's abemaciclib — 86.4% of patients experienced diarrhea vs. 24.7% of patients on the placebo-chemo combination. Lilly advises patients to begin an anti-diarrheal medicine at the first sign of diarrhea.IBD'S TAKE: Want to keep tabs on the market during the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting next month? Bookmark IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News page.The results were presented late Wednesday ahead of the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in June in Chicago. Other abstracts uploaded Wednesday include those from Merck (MRK), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Roche (RHHBY), Tesaro (TSRO), Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY).Incyte (INCY) stock spiked to a month-high Thursday after its epacadostat proved effective in combos with Merck's Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo, outdoing Roche's Tecentriq with NewLink Genetics' (NLNK) rival to epacadostat.But that wasn't Merck's only note of interest. Merck also offered a pair of updates in its ""famous"" trial, dubbed Keynote-024, which has found that Keytruda is better than chemo as a first treatment for advanced lung cancer.The hazard ratio for Keytruda dropped to 0.69 from 0.9, Merck said. Although this is ""not statistically significant, the favorable trend may have helped them in recent FDA approval,"" Evercore's Raffat said in a note.Merck's Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo are what's known as immuno-oncology drugs. They work to block the interaction between a PD-1 protein on an immune system cell and a PD-L1 protein on a cancer cell to help the immune system identify the cancer.In its Keynote-024 trial, Merck also found lung-cancer patients treated with Keytruda in their initial round saw continued benefit from Keytruda in the second round if the cancer progressed. This cements ""the role for PD-1 (inhibitors) in first-line (treatment) even further,"" Raffat said.In a Phase 1 trial, Regeneron and Sanofi found their PD-1 drug, known as REGN-2810, had a benefit rate of 52% for patients with a common form of skin cancer. The drug had a 70% control rate, ""which is very encouraging in this disease setting,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said.The American Cancer Society estimates that 5.4 million patients are diagnosed with and 20,000 die of basal and squamous cell skin cancers each year in the U.S. Longer term, there might be potential for REGN-2810 to treat patients with advanced, but not necessarily fatal, skin cancers.Of the 26 patients enrolled in Regeneron/Sanofi's trial, one showed a complete response of 19 months — meaning all discernible signs of cancer disappeared. Porges kept his outperform rating on Regeneron stock.Though there was ""little of note"" in Tesaro's abstract ahead of the conference, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez says the most interesting data presented next month will be a combination trial of Tesaro's Zejula and Merck's Keytruda in breast and ovarian cancer.Zejula competes vs. AstraZeneca (AZN) and Clovis Oncology (CLVS) in a class of drugs called PARP inhibitors which works to block a specific enzyme to treat ovarian cancer. PARP inhibitors are currently being investigated in breast cancer as well.Combining a PARP inhibitor and an immuno-oncology drug like Merck's Keytruda is thought to be more potent in treating cancer. Tesaro is also looking at Zejula plus a PD-1, like Keytruda, in advanced lung cancer.The company is slated to present data from a dozen patients treated with Zejula and Keytruda. Fernandez notes that the bar is fairly low to outperform. Alone, PD-1 inhibitors have a 10%-15% response rate in this group of patients. PARP inhibitors have a mid-20% response rate.""Although recently published data from a small trial of AstraZeneca's Imfinzi (a PD-L1 inhibitor) plus Lynparza (a PARP inhibitor) showed a somewhat disappointing 17% response rate in 10 ovarian cancer patients, Tesaro believes the combination of a PD-1 antibody plus Zejula will be superior,"" Fernandez said.RELATED:Incyte Teams Up With Dow's Merck To Trounce Roche In CancerDid AstraZeneca Rival Just Launch A Potential Blockbuster Drug?

38,INCY,"Eli Lilly (LLY) stock dipped early Tuesday though the drugmaker topped Wall Street's first-quarter sales and profits expectations.Baricitinib, Lilly and Incyte's (INCY) rheumatoid arthritis drug, needs more clinical data before the FDA will bless it. But, on Monday, Lilly said its breast cancer drug abemaciclib, rivaling that of Pfizer (PFE) and Novartis (NVS), met its goals at an interim analysis.The breast cancer win gave Lilly stock some confidence heading into its early Tuesday first-quarter earnings report. On the call, investors will likely look for commentary regarding plans for baricitinib, but also strong numbers for its diabetes and chemotherapy units.Among new drugs, Lilly's biggest are Trulicity, a diabetes drug, and Cyramza, a tumor drug.

42,INCY,"Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) toppled late Tuesday on mixed results from a Phase 3 trial testing its immuno-oncology combination vs. chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with advanced kidney cancer.In after-hours trading on the stock market today, Bristol dove nearly 3% to 56.20 after ending the regular session up 0.4%, at 57.87, following the release. Investors have been keyed in on Bristol's drugs, Opdivo and Yervoy, as a potentially strong combination in treating some cancers.In the trial dubbed CheckMate-214, a larger proportion of patients treated with the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy experienced tumor shrinkage, 41.6%, vs. 26.5% of patients treated with a chemotherapy known as sunitinib.The median duration of response wasn't reached for the immuno-oncology combination whereas chemotherapy reached that point at 18.17 months.But while there was an improvement in progression-free survival, it wasn't statistically significant. The median progression-free survival for patients on the Opdivo-Yervoy combo was 11.56 months vs. 8.38 months for chemotherapy, Bristol said in a news release.IBD'S TAKE: Merck is benefiting on the backs of rivals like AstraZeneca and Bristol, says one analyst. Visit IBD's Technology page for a closer look at how the immuno-oncology battle looks to shake out.Bristol spokesperson Vicki Goodman was encouraged by the results. Checkmate-214 will continue to get a better look at overall survival rates, the company said. Tolerability proved consistent with earlier trials.""The overall response rate and durability of response favored the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy, and the trend for (progression-free survival) supports the potential of the combination in intermediate and poor-risk advanced renal cell carcinoma,"" Goodman said in a statement.Opdivo is already approved as a second treatment for renal cell carcinoma, the most common form of liver cancer. The Checkmate-214 study looked at Opdivo and a second immuno-oncology drug, Yervoy, in previously untreated liver cancer patients.Immuno-oncology drugs work to teach the immune system to fight cancer.

43,INCY,"Kite Pharma (KITE) won't be Gilead Sciences' (GILD) next Pharmasset, an analyst said Monday after Gilead announced the $11.9 billion merger — sending Kite stock into the stratosphere.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Kite rocketed 28% to finish at near 178.05, hitting a record high about three years after it filed its initial public offering. But Gilead stock was less enthusiastic, rising 1.2% to close at 74.69.Evercore analyst Umer Raffat says there's no guarantee acquiring Kite will be as transformative for Gilead as its $11 billion bet on Pharmasset in 2011. The Pharmasset deal gave Gilead access to a key drug that kicked off its blockbuster hepatitis C franchise.""Both deals are generally comparable in size, and the enormous commercial success of Pharmasset deal is still very fresh in investors' eyes,"" Raffat wrote in a note to clients.But Pharmasset was the clear leader in its class, whereas Kite is just one in a pack of companies working on what are known as CAR-T therapies, which harnesses the body's own immune system to fight cancer. Novartis (NVS), Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE)/Celgene (CELG) are also working in this arena.Further, the logistics are different. Hepatitis C drugs are pills taken once daily. In CAR-T therapies, a patient's blood is drawn into a vial and then the immune system cells are reprogrammed to fight cancer before being reintroduced to the body. That requires a specific infrastructure, Raffat noted.And there's no proof of concept in the ""blue sky scenario."" Kite is trailing Novartis in CAR-T therapies with both expected to gain approvals in blood cancers later this year. But the firms have yet to prove a similar concept in solid tumors called T-cell receptor technology.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks have slowed down from a July spike as long-term views on several players look dim. Could Gilead's acquisition of Kite help them recover? Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look.Still, ""the true inflection points in the Kite story are yet to come,"" he said. Kite is closing in on approval of its drug, axicabtagene ciloleucel, to treat an aggressive form of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It will have first-mover advantage in that setting.The deal is set to close in the fourth quarter, Gilead said in a news release. This means ""2018 will now become a very important year,"" Raffat said. The ""Street will be very focused on validating this purchase.""Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says the consensus is calling for Kite's drug to reach $1.6 billion in peak sales by 2022. He sees three initial approvals in blood and bone marrow cancers, and notes trials are ongoing in three other blood cancers.""The transaction is not a complete surprise"" given earlier commentary, he wrote in a note to clients. The 30% premium on Kite's stock after shares have risen 210% year to date ""is bracing and suggests that Gilead is expecting revenue of $2 billion to $3 billion from Kite's CAR-T platform.""Kite was already on the short-list as a potential acquisition for Gilead. In the first quarter, Gilead had said it wanted to do a deal in cancer, and analysts suggested Kite, Incyte (INCY), Tesaro (TSRO) and Clovis Oncology (CLVS) could be on the list.But as recently as several weeks ago, Kite Chief Executive John Milligan reportedly said the firm ""might end up doing nothing in oncology"" if the right deal doesn't present itself. The Street has been pushing Gilead to make a deal as its hepatitis C drug sales have begun to decline.Gilead's key strategy going forward will be ""cell therapy.""

44,INCY,"A delay in getting its rheumatoid arthritis drug to market by at least 18 months sent Eli Lilly (LLY) shares lower Tuesday as the drug giant reported second-quarter earnings.XOn the stock market today, Lilly toppled 3% to close at 82.19. Shares had been in a buy zone at Monday's close after breaking out of a cup-with-handle at an 84.86 buy point. Lilly's partner on the arthritis drug, Incyte (INCY), fell 3.4% to finish at 133.56.The Food and Drug Administration is requiring Lilly and Incyte to run another trial to determine the benefits and risks across doses of the drug, now known as baricitinib, before resubmitting their application for approval.Lilly estimates at least 18 months to resubmit the application, putting the approval of baricitinib beyond 2017. Baricitinib is approved in Europe to treat moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis.Also early Tuesday, Lilly reported $5.82 billion in second-quarter sales, ahead of the consensus for $5.59 billion from analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research.Adjusted profits of $1.11 per share topped by 7 cents, according to Zacks. Revenue grew 8% with profits per share up 29%.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks are on a hot streak, now ranked fourth out of 197 groups tracked by IBD. But mergers and acquisitions could send them higher, some say. Visit IBD Industry Themes for a deep dive on who might be for sale.Diabetes drug Trulicity and plaque psoriasis drug Taltz led growth in the quarter, up 139% and 618%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Sales of Basaglar, an insulin to treat adults and children with Type 1 diabetes, grew 432%.Lilly also raised its 2017 sales guidance to $22 billion to $22.5 billion, up from earlier views for $21.8 billion to $22.3 billion. Adjusted income was raised to $4.10-$4.20 a share for the year, which would be up 16%-19% from 2016.RELATED:'Stars Align' For These Biotechs To Crush Earnings ConsensusThis Biotech Nearly Tripled Street Expectations For One Key DrugCould This Small Biotech Break Out On A Tie-Up With Eli Lilly?

45,INCY,"Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Cytomx (CTMX) could be working on a less potent version of Yervoy and have data as early as 2018, an analyst said Thursday — a month after the two announced a deeper tie.Though neither has commented specifically on which types of cancer they'll target in their deepened partnership, Bristol-Myers recently filed its plan to begin a three-year study of 531 patients with melanoma.Evercore analyst Umer Raffat called the filing with ClinicalTrials.gov ""intriguing."" The trial will be a head-to-head comparison of a new immuno-oncology drug vs. Yervoy and look at a combination with Opdivo.Although the filing doesn't identify whether the new immuno-oncology drug is Cytomx's, the pairing would make sense considering Bristol and Cytomx announced a deeper tie on March 20 to explore up to eight additional targets in oncology.Their goal, Raffat says, is likely to find a less potent version of Yervoy, an immuno-oncology drug. Yervoy belongs to a class of drugs called CTLA-4 antibodies, which work to help the immune system identify cancer cells hiding behind CTLA-4 proteins.Yervoy is effective, but it's also toxic. Its label includes warnings of ""severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions"" including inflammation of the small intestine and colon, hepatitis, skin disorders, nerve damage and endocrine gland damage.Cytomx is working on what is calls ""probody"" technology. These therapeutics are activated by certain conditions in the tumor environment. The goal is to limit the toxicity to the affected tissue and improve or create a therapeutic window.""In simpler words, the intention is to develop a safer anti-CTLA-4 which delivers its effect at the tumor site and avoids the systemic tax elsewhere (which we see a ton of with Yervoy),"" Raffat said in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Other team-ups have been particularly strong for the smaller biotechs involved. Incyte (INCY) is pairing up with Dow component Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb in a number of tumor trials. Head to IBD's Technology page for a breakdown of why Incyte might be the true winner.Bristol's main goal of the trial is to reduce the incidence of adverse/serious events. The firm hopes its drug will operate as a more effective monotherapy vs. Yervoy in improving objective response rate, median duration of response and progression-free survival.It will also combine the new CTLA-4 with Opdivo. Opdivo works similarly to Yervoy, but instead works to block the interaction between the immune system and the PD-1 proteins a tumor cell uses to hide. Opdivo rivals Merck's Keytruda.Raffat expects to see early results in 2018.""(The) focus will clearly be on whether the (toxicity) profile is materially better than Yervoy,"" he said. ""In addition, it will also be interesting to see if there is an improvement.""Bristol-Myers stock closed up 0.45% at 53.44 on the stock market today, and Cytomx stock jumped 5.8% to 16.14.RELATED:Step Aside, Merck And Bristol: These Are Your Future Rivals In Cancer DrugsBristol-Myers 'Holding Up Better' But Dow's Merck Still Gouging ShareCould Bristol's Drug Help Biogen Take AbbVie In Alzheimer's?

46,INCY,"AbbVie (ABBV) will get some breathing room in rheumatoid arthritis after Eli Lilly (LLY) and Incyte's (INCY) drug was hit with delays by the Food and Drug Administration over the weekend, leaving Lilly to instead focus on a Pfizer (PFE)-rivaling breast cancer med.On Friday, the FDA asked for more dosing information for Lilly and Incyte's rheumatoid arthritis drug, baricitinib, causing what could be a lengthy delay in its release. So Lilly's breast cancer drug known as abemaciclib is now especially important for Lilly, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said.Abemaciclib could compete against Pfizer's Ibrance and Novartis' (NVS) Kisqali in the CDK4/6 inhibitor market. These drugs aim to inhibit a specific set of enzymes thought to be tied to breast cancer.""In our Lilly model, we are currently forecasting $1.5 billion global sales of abemaciclib by 2026 with the overall CDK4/6 market reaching more than $10 billion,"" Fernandez wrote in a note to clients.Fernandez said abemaciclib could be the next major catalyst for Lilly's stock. Phase 3 data on abemaciclib is expected in June.""We believe abemaciclib's ability to dose continuously together with a safe and manageable tolerability profile likely will make abemaciclib highly competitive with Novartis' Kisqali — and provide opportunities to differentiate from Pfizer's Ibrance on secondary efficacy measures like response rate,"" Fernandez said.The analyst kept his outperform rating and 91 price target on Lilly stock.Lilly shares toppled as much as 5.6% on the stock market today, closing down 4.1% to 82.38, below its 50-day ling and a 83.34 buy point. Incyte stock tumbled 10.5% to 126.07. The delay on baricitinib means it likely won't get FDA approval until 2018 and launch until 2019. That removes a near-term rival for AbbVie's Humira. It also puts Lilly/Incyte seven to eight years behind Pfizer's Xeljanz, and more in line with generic-like competition.Analysts expect the drug to be delayed at least a year, and shares of Lilly and Incyte toppled early Monday. Baricitinib already has been approved for use in Europe.While baricitinib is likely delayed, Fernandez expects $1.7 billion in peak U.S. sales when it is approved. And Lilly still benefits from sales in Europe where the drug has attained approval.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's 43-company Ethical-Drugmakers industry group has risen to No. 150 out of 197 groups tracked from No. 184 just four weeks ago. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the top-rated drugmakers.Other analysts agreed on the one-year delay for baricitinib, but were more cautious on Lilly's breast cancer drug. BMO analyst Alex Arfaei called abemaciclib ""the biggest remaining uncertainty for Lilly in 2017."" He sees the data as likely to disappoint.""We still have not seen much data that would indicate CDK4/6 inhibitors are meaningfully differentiated,"" he wrote in a report. ""Data from (the American Association for Cancer Research) 2017 suggests abemaciclib is not as selective as ribociclib (Kisqali) and Ibrance.""Arfaei cut his price target on Lilly stock to 71 from 73, though he maintained his forecast for 5% sales growth for Lilly in 2017 on its diabetes drugs Trulicity, Jardiance and Basaglar, and psoriasis drug Talz.These drugs ""should offset the decline of mature franchises,"" he wrote. ""However, from 2015-20, we forecast revenue compound annual growth rate of 4%, below Lilly's guidance of 5% partly because more conservative assumptions for the mature franchises.""RELATED:Eli Lilly, Incyte Stocks Break Key Levels After FDA Drug SetbackHow Biogen's Takeover Prospects Soured In Mere MonthsBiotechs Split: Axovant Rides CEO Swap, But Celgene Partner Dives

47,INCY,"Eli Lilly (LLY) and Incyte (INCY) shares plunged Monday morning after the Food and Drug Administration failed to approve their rheumatoid arthritis drug baricitinib, saying more data are needed.Eli Lilly and Incyte ""disagreed"" with the FDA's Friday decision, which came somewhat as a surprise after European regulators approved baricitinib in February. If Lilly and Incyte have to conduct more clinical trials to satisfy the FDA, the delay could set their drug behind several rivals.Lilly reaffirmed its earnings and sales guidance for the year, while Incyte will discuss the matter in its Q1 conference call.Eli Lilly fell 4.1% to close at 82.38 on the stock market today. Eli Lilly has fallen below an 83.34 buy point cleared in early March.Incyte tumbled 10.5% to 126.07, plunging through its 50-day moving average.The setback for Lilly and Incyte is good news for Dow Jones industrial average component Pfizer (PFE), which has the only oral JAK inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis on the market, Xeljanz. Gilead Sciences (GILD), has a similar oral drug to baricitinib in Phase Three trials.

50,INCY,"AstraZeneca (AZN) stock dipped to a month-low Monday after an analyst noted the ongoing rivalry with Merck (MRK) could hurt AstraZeneca's chances in lung cancer.Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford downgraded AstraZeneca shares to hold from buy. At Monday's close on the stock market today, shares were down 1.3% to 29.90 after earlier falling as much as 1.6%. Shares have been creating a cup-with-handle formation since August.But Holford doesn't see AstraZeneca stock as a short play. AstraZeneca is testing immuno-oncology drugs durvalumab and tremelimumab alone and combined in advanced lung cancer. The company expects to have progression-free survival data in mid-2017 and final overall survival data in 2018.Holford trimmed his peak sales expectations for durvalumab and tremelimumab by $1.7 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, ""primarily due to competition from chemo-(immuno-oncology) combos."" In total, he sees the two drugs bringing in $5.1 billion.Merck is largely thought to be in the lead on immuno-oncology combinations with chemo. In January, the FDA accepted an application from Merck to combine its immuno-oncology drug Keytruda with chemotherapy in advanced lung cancer.IBD'S TAKE: There are more than 1,000 ongoing trials in immuno-oncology, an analyst told IBD earlier this year. But only a handful of drugs are actually approved. Head to IBD's Technology page for an overview of the first approvals in the emerging sector.Immuno-oncology drugs teach the body to identify cancer by blocking the interaction between an immune system cell and the specific enzymes or proteins a cancer cell uses to hide. Durvalumab is what's called an anti-PD-L1 antibody. Tremelimumab is an anti-CTLA-4 antibody.Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Roche (RHHBY) and Incyte (INCY) are also notable in the immuno-oncology scene. Though Incyte doesn't have a drug approved, its epacadostat is being tested in conjunction with drugs from Bristol and Merck.RELATED:Step Aside, Merck And Bristol: These Are Your Future Rivals In Cancer DrugsBristol Keeps Up With Merck In Cancer, But Incyte Is True Winner: AnalystWill Bristol Prove This Longtime Theory In Cancer Defense?

51,INCY,"Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) is keeping pace with rival Merck (MRK) after announcing a partnership with Incyte (INCY) that will see drug combos in lung and head-and-neck cancers in late-stage trials this year.Incyte, though, appears to be the biggest beneficiary, RBC analyst Simos Simeonidis said in a note to clients. Simeonidis boosted his price target on Incyte stock to 157 from 138. Per the agreement, Incyte can test its drug, epacadostat, with drugs from other companies.That's important because some drugmakers are testing combinations of immuno-oncology drugs and Incyte is one of just a handful working on what's known as an IDO-1 inhibitor. Immuno-oncology drugs work by teaching the immune system to identify cancer. IDO-1 inhibitors target a specific protein.""Importantly, this arrangement maintains optionality for (Incyte's drug) epacadostat going forward and leaves open the possibility for the drug to be approved for use in combination with multiple checkpoint inhibitors,"" Simeonidis wrote in a note titled ""Bristol keeps up with Merck in the IDO game.""Incyte is testing epacadostat in combination with Merck's Keytruda, Bristol's Opdivo and AstraZeneca's (AZN) durvalumab and tremelimumab. Keytruda and Opdivo inhibit the interaction — called a checkpoint — between the immune system and a camouflaged cancer cell to help the immune system see the cancer.IBD'S TAKE: What if your body could fight off cancer cells like it fights off the everyday germs? It's not a dream, it's a reality. Head to IBD's Technology page for a breakdown on the emerging immuno-oncology sector.AstraZeneca's durvalumab targets the PD-L1 protein, and tremelimumab target the CTLA-4 protein receptor, similar to Bristol's Yervoy. Incyte and AstraZeneca are working on Phase 1/2 studies of these drugs in combination with epacadostat.""We would expect Phase 3 go/no-go decisions from these combinations starting this year and into 2018,"" Simeonidis wrote. This means AstraZeneca will trail Merck and Bristol slightly as they now are prepping to advance combinations with epacadostat into Phase 3 trials.In midday trading on the stock market today, Bristol stock slipped 0.1% to 54.14, and Merck stock lifted a fraction, to 63.67. Incyte stock was up 2.2% to 141.55. AstraZeneca stock was up less than 1% to 31.28.RELATED:Bristol 'Can't Afford To Lose' To Dow Stock Merck In Immuno-OncologyWill Bristol Prove This Longtime Theory In Cancer Defense?Dow's Merck Swipes Immuno-Oncology Share From Heavyweight Rivals
"
52,INCY,"Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) stock popped early Monday after the drugmaker said its immuno-oncology drug combination significantly improved overall survival in melanoma patients — proving a long-standing theory in cancer treatment and giving the company a leg up over rival and Dow component Merck (MRK).After two years, previously untreated advanced melanoma patients who had received a combination of Opdivo and Yervoy showed overall survival rates of 64%. That compared with 59% for patients on Opdivo alone and 45% for patients on Yervoy alone.Combined, Opdivo and Yervoy reduced the risk of death by 45% vs. a 37% reduction for patients on Yervoy alone, Bristol said in a news release.The news is good for Bristol because it can't afford to lose in immuno-oncology, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said early Monday.""There is ample evidence that the competitive landscape can evolve quickly and painfully,"" he wrote in a note to clients.In Bristol's tests, the portion of patients whose detectable tumors disappeared compared with an earlier 18-month follow-up increased in the combination group to 17.2% from 12.1%, to 14.9% from 9.8% in Opdivo alone and to 4.4% from 2.2% in Yervoy alone.But the combination also appeared somewhat more toxic, per expectations. Grade three and four adverse events occurred in 58% of patients who received the combination and in 21% and 28% of Opdivo and Yervoy monotherapy patients, respectively.Other companies are working on immuno-oncology drugs that target different proteins or enzymes. Yervoy targets the CTLA-4 protein receptor. Incyte's (INCY) epacadostat targets the IDO enzyme. AstraZeneca's durvalumab and tremelimumab work on the PD-L1 protein and CTLA-4 protein receptor, respectively.Certain combinations are thought to be particularly potent in fighting cancer, though most analysts see PD-1 drugs as the ""backbone"" for immuno-oncology. To that end, Bristol announced over the weekend that it's teaming up with Incyte to pair Opdivo and epacadostat in several tumors.Merck, a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, and Bristol both plan to present data on their combinations with epacadostat in June. ""We expect the results to justify the advance to multiple Phase 3 (trials).""IBD'S TAKE: Bristol-Myers Squibb has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 52, meaning it outperforms about half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But it's still far and away from Jazz Pharmaceuticals, which leads among drugmakers with a CR of 83 out of a best-possible 99. Head to the Stock Checkup to see how your picks stack up.Drugmakers had long theorized that combining two immuno-oncology drugs could boost potency. Bristol's trial is the first to prove it. AstraZeneca (AZN) also is working on a similar combination in advanced lung cancer.In a separate study, Bristol was able to increase overall survival rates in patients with previously treated advanced lung cancer to 16% after five years. Historically, five-year survival rates for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer have been less than 5%, Bristol said.This is the longest survival follow-up in advanced lung cancer using an immuno-oncology drug that teaches the immune system to identify cancer cells, Bristol said. Opdivo and Merck's Keytruda do this by targeting a specific protein called PD-1.In midmorning trading on the stock market today, Bristol stock was down a fraction at the close to 54.21, after earlier rising as much as 1.4%. Shares pared back after Bristol announced Opdivo failed to improve overall survival over Roche's Avastin in patients with a brain cancer called glioblastoma multiforme.Shares of Merck were off fractionally to 63.47.RELATED:Will Bristol Prove This Longstanding Theory In Cancer Defense?Dow's Merck Swipes Immuno-Oncology Share From Heavyweight Rivals

53,INCY,"Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Opdivo and Yervoy combo will likely improve overall survival in melanoma patients, an analyst said Friday, ahead of the American Association of Cancer Research meeting next week.The results of the trial of Opdivo and Yervoy in melanoma could prove a long-standing theory that coupling immuno-oncology drugs provides a more potent cancer defense. Bristol is the first to unveil results of an immuno-oncology combo.At the closing bell on the stock market today, Bristol stock was down 1.8%, to 54.38. At the cancer research association's annual gathering April 1-5 in Washington, D.C., Bristol is set to release data in several immuno-oncology trials.Drugs like Opdivo and Yervoy work to teach the immune system to identify cancer cells. What it identifies, it can fight. Opdivo targets the PD-1 protein, whereas Yervoy targets the CTLA-4 protein receptor. Bristol is also working on another target called IDO-1.On Monday, Bristol will unveil the results of its combination of Opdivo and Yervoy vs. Opdivo alone and Yervoy alone in first-line melanoma. Earlier results showed strong progression-free survival in the combo, but this will look at overall survival.Evercore analyst Umer Raffat expects Bristol to hit its goal of improving overall survival in melanoma patients on the combined drug. The FDA conditionally approved Opdivo and Yervoy to treat first-line melanoma on strong earlier trial results.IBD'S TAKE: The immuno-oncology sector could be worth $25 billion by 2025 just based on the targets already identified, an analyst told IBD in February. Head to IBD's Technology page for the deep dive.Bristol will also release the results of a five-year study of Opdivo in previously untreated advanced lung cancer patients later Monday. On Tuesday, Bristol will present data on its IDO-1 inhibitor, known only as BMS-986205, alone and in combination with Opdivo in advanced tumors.The company also has 10 more presentations highlighting studies and research in multiple tumor types including lung, melanoma, and head and neck cancers.Bristol's Opdivo competes against Merck's (MRK) Keytruda as both are PD-1 antibodies approved in advanced lung cancer, melanoma, and head and neck cancers. Opdivo has several more approvals than Keytruda and a broader market share.Roche (RHHBY), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Incyte (INCY) also are working on immuno-oncology drugs. Roche's Tecentriq is approved in advanced lung cancer and advanced bladder cancer. Incyte's epacadostat, which targets IDO-1, is being explored in seven tumor types in combination with Merck's Keytruda.RELATED:These Are The First Immune-System Cancer Drugs OK'd By FDA

54,INCY,"AstraZeneca (AZN) not only failed in a lung cancer trial — which had the side effect of sending rival Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) spiraling — but its partnership with Dow's Merck (MRK) appears to be ""an admission of defeat in the initial immuno-oncology race.""XShares of AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers sold off in droves early Thursday. On the stock market today, AstraZeneca took a pitfall to a five-month low, down 14.9% to 28.88. Bristol, too, sank 3.1% to 54.24.The so-called Mystic trial from AstraZeneca impacts Bristol, analysts say. In a late-stage trial, a combination of AstraZeneca's Imfinzi and tremelimumab failed to meet its primary goal of improving progression-free survival in advanced lung cancer patients compared with chemotherapy.AstraZeneca will continue the trial with the hopes the combination will improve upon overall survival in patients with advanced lung cancer whose tumors display 25% or more of a protein called PD-L1. But analysts were bearish on the likelihood of success.""Although AstraZeneca has two more shots on goal for this combo, we see commercial success of this combination as severely limited even if a small benefit on survival is ultimately realized,"" Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez wrote in a note to clients.The results are similarly negative for Bristol. Bristol is looking at its drugs Opdivo and Yervoy in a trial called Checkmate-227. Opdivo is what's known as a PD-1 antibody, whereas AstraZeneca's Imfinzi is a PD-L1 antibody. Bristol's Yervoy and AstraZeneca's tremelimumab, though, belong the same class of CTLA-4 antibodies.""While there are several key differences in trial design between Mystic and Checkmate-227, they are unlikely to result in meaningfully different outcomes,"" Fernandez said. He noted final results from AstraZeneca's trial are expected in 2018 with Bristol's trial due in the first half of next year.IBD'S TAKE: What could send biotech stocks higher this year? Mergers and acquisitions, says one industry observer. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a deep dive on what's going right for the industry and who might be on a shopping spree.Also as a result, Incyte (INCY) has one less rival for its epacadostat, an IDO antibody, in advanced lung cancer, Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt noted in a research report. Incyte is combining epacadostat with Merck's Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo in a number of trials.AstraZeneca also seemingly admitted defeat in the initial immuno-oncology race, Fernandez said. The drugmaker is teaming up with Merck to get access to its drug Keytruda, a PD-1 antibody like Bristol's Opdivo. The duo plan to look at immuno-oncology combos with Lynparza, a PARP inhibitor.Merck will share development and commercialization costs of Lynparza and a drug called selumetinib. Merck will pay AstraZeneca up to $8.5 billion, including $1.6 billion upfront, $750 million for licensing and up to $6.15 billion in milestones. AstraZeneca will also have to share profits from the two drugs.""Given AstraZeneca's interest in combining Lynparza with a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor, this deal looks to us like a tacit admission of the importance of owning a leading PD-1 (antibody) when developing cancer combinations,"" Fernandez said.The combination also has a surprising benefit for Clovis Oncology (CLVS), Janney analyst Debjit Chattopadhyay said. Clovis and Tesaro (TSRO) have drugs in the PARP inhibitor arena. But Tesaro is partnered with Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical, and now AstraZeneca is partnered with Merck.""Clovis' Rubraca now remains the only unencumbered PARP (inhibitor) and on a relative basis remains far cheaper than peer Tesaro,"" he wrote in a note to clients. ""Based on the valuation gap, no clinical events to derail the story and pipeline leveraged to Rubraca, Clovis stock could be a more compelling M&A candidate in our view.""Merck stock popped 3.1% to 63.69.

55,INCY,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) ""might end up doing nothing in oncology"" if the right takeover deal doesn't present itself, Chief Executive John Milligan reportedly told an analyst Wednesday.XThe third-largest biotech by market cap, Gilead has struggled with declining sales of hepatitis C drugs for several quarters. In the first quarter, Gilead hinted that it could be looking to buy an oncology player. But Gilead remained mum on a potential merger in the recent second quarter.It appears Gilead is looking for a ""transformative"" acquisition, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note to clients after meeting with the biotech's management Wednesday. The firm is struggling to identify such an opportunity.""As CEO John Milligan explained it, he didn't think it made much sense to buy something small today in the hope it might grow into something large,"" Porges said. Instead, Milligan is looking for a company with ""substantial data, value and scale.""Analysts have suggested Gilead could look to acquire companies like Tesaro (TSRO), Incyte (INCY), Clovis Oncology (CLVS) or Kite Pharma (KITE) in cancer, or Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) in cystic fibrosis. Recently, United Therapeutics (UTHR) spiked on the potential that Gilead could take it over.IBD'S TAKE: The biotech industry is awaiting mergers and acquisitions to spike higher, says one industry observer. How does Gilead fit in? Visit IBD Industry Themes for a closer look.Gilead also noted that it's still interested in fibrosis programs. In 2015-16, it bought two firms with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) programs: Phenex Pharmaceuticals and Nimbus Therapeutics. NASH is a liver disease.In the meantime, Gilead is calling for declines in its hepatitis C unit, despite beating views in the second quarter. Porges sees revenue from hepatitis C drugs falling 30% in 2017 and then dipping 15%-25% annually through 2020.""This decline is likely to accelerate in 2017 and beyond as better competitive hepatitis C regimens come to market,"" he wrote. ""Our outlook for the company's HIV business remains positive, but this is not sufficient to offset the dynamics of the hepatitis C business.""Among those competitive regimens, AbbVie's (ABBV) Mavyret gained approval earlier this month to treat all genotypes of hepatitis C. Gilead acknowledged that AbbVie's biggest advantage is in the treatment of genotypes 2-6, rivaling Gilead's Epclusa and Sovaldi.Chief Operating Officer Kevin Young says the contracting cycle is now in full swing, but that doesn't mean every payer will defer to AbbVie's Mavyret over Gilead's drugs. Mavyret is being priced at a discount to Gilead's Harvoni and Epclusa, Porges said in a note last week.In its HIV unit, Gilead remains bullish on its chances of fending off GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), which is working on two drug combinations. Recently, concerns have emerged regarding the safety of Glaxo's double-drug for HIV and questions of the infection's ability to adapt to treatment.Gilead stock closed down 1.6%, at 72.70, on the stock market today.RELATED:Gilead Could Be Making An Acquisition — But It's Not What You ThinkHow AbbVie's 'Gauntlet' Could Squeeze Gilead's Drugs In Hepatitis CGilead's Hepatitis C Franchise Topples Again, But Shares Up On Beat

56,INCY,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) could fill a hole in its portfolio by acquiring Incyte (INCY), an analyst suggested Friday, offering one caveat — Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) would still be a less risky bet.Though Gilead could make a play now for Incyte — to the tune of a 30%-40% premium on its stock price — the No. 3 biotech would largely be betting on the commercial success of Incyte's immuno-oncology drug, epacadostat. Meanwhile, it's dealing with a slump in its Hepatitis C drug-sales unit.""Much of the value of the acquisition depends on achieving substantial sales (more than $4 billion by 2025) of epacadostat in the highly competitive and somewhat unpredictable world of immuno-oncology,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note to clients.Porges imagines that Gilead could afford to pay $173-$187 a share to acquire Incyte. Earlier this year, Gilead acknowledged that it could be open to a deal, particularly in oncology. Analysts have suggested Incyte, Tesaro (TSRO), Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and Kite Pharma (KITE) as potential targets.Incyte could help fill some gaps in Gilead's portfolio, Porges said. Its flagship product, Jakafi, is approved in a number of blood disorders and regions, and Incyte is also working on its immuno-oncology drug in trials with Dow's Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).IBD'S TAKE: Cancer therapies are winning investor approval with Kite Pharma sitting on top of a running streak. Check out the Industry Snapshot for a closer look at which companies might prove to be a strong bet.At a 30%-40% premium to Incyte's stock price, the deal could generate 19% accretion by year five, he said. The transaction could create an 11% rate of return for Gilead shareholders over the next 10 years. These projections are dependent on strong sales for epacadostat.Using a 75% premium model, Gilead's earnings would be dilutive until 2018, with an internal rate of return that's north of 8%.""While both the Vertex and Incyte deals are similar in size, Vertex represents a lower risk but less strategic option for Gilead given the limited (but still substantial) application of Vertex's products and technologies,"" he said.Incyte, on the other hand, offers a high risk/high reward with its epacadostat and broader development portfolio, he wrote.On the stock market today, Gilead fell 1 cent to 70.57. Incyte was up 0.6% to 134.27 and Vertex was up 7 cents to 130.99.RELATED:Are Gilead's Fortunes About To Change — Without An Acquisition?Gilead And Vertex Should Join — But Don't Hold Your Breath: AnalystWhy The Biotech Rally Could Still Tack On Another 15% Upside

57,INCY,"A key hepatitis C drug from Gilead Sciences (GILD) could top Wall Street's expectations, but investors will be tuning into the company's second-quarter report on July 26 for more hints on potential M&A activity, an analyst said Friday.Gilead's hepatitis C sales slipped in 2016 and, in the months following, the No. 3 biotech said it could be open to a deal, especially in oncology. Analysts have been quick to offer up Incyte (INCY), Tesaro (TSRO), Kite Pharma (KITE) and Clovis Oncology (CLVS) as potential acquisition targets.Others have said Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) would be a smart buy to help fend off a larger dip in its hepatitis C franchise. But Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young expects Gilead's Harvoni, a key hepatitis C drug, to beat analysts' second-quarter models.For the period, she models Gilead pulling in $6.34 billion in sales, just north of the consensus, and $2.18 adjusted income per share, topping broader forecasts by a nickel. She expects a $110 million beat on U.S. Harvoni sales, at $857 million. That would still be down 7% year over year.Young also expects Gilead's Genvoya, an HIV medication, to top Wall Street views for U.S. sales of $694 million. She models $781 million for the period and sees total prescriptions growing 17% quarter over quarter vs. consensus expectations for just 4% growth.""However, we don't expect shares to react strongly to a beat since we think investors are looking for Gilead to do a deal,"" she wrote in a note clients.IBD'S TAKE: Big biotechs are likely to struggle this year as investor focus turns to smaller, cancer- and rare-disease-focused biotechs, analysts say. Head to the Industry Snapshot for a closer look at which companies are piquing analyst interest.Biogen (BIIB) also will be in the limelight as investors look for a strategic update and plans for growth amid heightened competition in the multiple sclerosis arena. No. 1 drugmaker Roche (RHHBY), in March, gained approval of its drug Ocrevus to treat two forms of multiple sclerosis.Young sees Biogen's key MS drugs, Tecfidera and Tysabri, pulling in-line sales, though her long-term numbers are below the Street. For the quarter, Young forecasts in-line total sales at $2.8 billion, but sees adjusted profits missing views at $4.04 a share to consensus' views for $4.50. Biogen is scheduled to report Q2 results and give a strategic update on July 25.For the strategic update, she looks for Biogen to give some insight into its collaboration with Eisai as well as newly seated Chief Executive Michel Vounatsos' long-term vision for the company. Investors also likely will want an update on Alzheimer's drug aducanumab.""We think investors are hoping to hear that the company will give an interim readout on the aducanumab Phase 3 trial next year,"" she said. ""For some we think it will make them want to own, but for others they may want to wait until after the data.""Incyte could beat on the top line from strong Jakafi sales, but investor focus will likely be on its immuno-oncology drug epacadostat and strategic partnerships with Dow's Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY). Incyte is set to report Q2 earnings on Aug. 1.More broadly, Young expects an in-line quarter for large-cap biotechs. She sees Amgen (AMGN), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Vertex and BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) reporting metrics in line with consensus views.RELATED:Gilead Could Acquire This Biotech — But Vertex Is Still Better: AnalystAre Gilead's Fortunes About To Change — Without An Acquisition?Why The Biotech Rally Could Still Tack On Another 15% Upside

58,INCY,"Gilead Sciences' (GILD) fortunes are likely to change this summer on the expected approval of a key hepatitis C drug regimen and after the No. 3 biotech unveils Phase 3 data from an HIV trial, an analyst said Friday.XYear to date, Gilead stock is down 3.3% as of Friday's close. Shares declined as much as 10.5% to the year's low of 64.12 on June 16, but have since recovered somewhat amid a biotech rally that saw the sector rise collectively to a 17-month high in late June. Gilead stock was off marginally to 69.25 on Friday.Needham analyst Alan Carr lists Gilead among the biotechs with ""potential for upside around specific events."" The upside is sorely needed for Gilead which is struggling with a decline in its hepatitis C franchise as the U.S. and European markets mature.Following that decline, Gilead has identified its HIV drug known as bictegravir as its next big hit. In July, Gilead is expected to unveil Phase 3 data for bictegravir during the International AIDS Society conference in Paris, Carr said in a note to clients.In August, the Food and Drug Administration is expected to approve Gilead's combination of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir in chronic hepatitis C patients who have failed specific prior treatments. The regimen is a 12-week treatment.Other analysts have suggested that Gilead should make an acquisition to bolster its pipeline. The company has indicated it would like to explore a merger in oncology, fueling rumors that it could be looking at Tesaro (TSRO) or Incyte (INCY).IBD'S TAKE: Among strong biotechs, Exelixis stock has rocketed to highs this year not seen in decades. Head to The New America to see what catalysts sent the stock flying and whether more could be around the corner.Outside of Gilead, Carr sees catalysts for a number of players like Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY), Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT), Neurocrine Biosciences (NBIX) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX).Alnylam is expected to have Phase 3 data for its drug, patisiran, in September. Patisiran is being investigated as a potential treatment for a rare disease that causes abnormal buildup of material called amyloid within the tissues. These deposits can damage the organs.If approved, patisiran will rival drugs from Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS). Ionis is currently working on a trial of its drug, inotersen, in a population of these patients. That study should help provide proof of mechanism for both patisiran and inotersen, Carr said.Later in the third quarter, Intercept is likely to announce Phase 2 results of its drug Ocaliva as a treatment for a disease that causes inflammation and scar tissue on the bile ducts. It can ultimately result in liver damage. Ocaliva is already approved to treat a similar liver disease.""We expect (a) positive outcome and await clarity on registration requirements,"" Carr said. ""Our second-quarter Ocaliva sales estimate is $27 million vs. consensus at $26 million.""Neurocrine's second-quarter earnings will, for the first time, include sales from its drug Ingrezza, approved in May as a treatment for involuntary movements associated with long-term use of certain medications. Carr models $800 million in sales for the period.Also in the second quarter, Carr estimates Vertex will bring in $186 million and $294 million in sales of Kalydeco and Orkambi, respectively. Kalydeco and Orkambi are cystic fibrosis drugs for patients with specific genetic mutations.RELATED:Gilead And Vertex Should Join — But Don't Hold Your Breath: AnalystWhy The Biotech Rally Could Still Tack On Another 15% UpsideCould This Small Biotech Pique Interest Of Gilead And Others?
"
59,INCY,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) would be better off acquiring Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) than an oncology asset like Tesaro (TSRO) or Incyte (INCY), an analyst suggested Friday as he lamented Gilead's cautious approach to mergers.XThe No. 3 biotech by market cap has shown interest in making an oncology-centric buy as it struggles with declining hepatitis C drug sales. The hepatitis C franchise brought in north of $44 billion over three years, but fell in 2016 for the first time.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says Gilead should turn away from the obvious cancer biotech buys — Tesaro, Incyte, Clovis Oncology (CLVS) or Kite Pharma (KITE) — and instead set its sights on Vertex. But, he said, it's likely Gilead will ignore that advice.""We would view an acquisition of a growing and largely de-risked revenue stream, such as Vertex, much more positively than a comparable investment, or set of investments, into the intensely competitive and technologically uncertain field of oncology,"" he said.Vertex would offer Gilead a rare disease portfolio and a robust pipeline. Vertex is now working on a triple-pill combination to treat cystic fibrosis, a lung disease. It's about a year ahead of its nearest rivals, Galapagos (GLPG)/AbbVie (ABBV), and the regimen looks likely to launch in 2020.Gilead has $32 billion in cash, meaning the company wouldn't have to stretch too much to make a transformational acquisition, Porges said. Vertex has a market cap of about $32 billion to Gilead's $92.4 billion market cap.Porges expects Gilead could pay up to $230 per share of Vertex stock and still make the acquisition accretive by year two with realistic synergies. Together with Vertex, Gilead could feasibly expand growth to 11 to 13 times that of slow-growing major pharmas.IBD'S TAKE: Big biotechs like Gilead struggled in the recent biotech rally. Instead, analysts say, keep your eyes on the biotechs highlighted in this Industry Snapshot.With Vertex in tow, Gilead could reverse its revenue trajectory from a projected decline to a 1.9% compound annual growth rate from 2017-22. The transaction would similarly improve an expected fractional decline in earnings to an estimated 5.2% growth rate over those years.But it's more likely Gilead will make a series of small transactions for relatively early-stage assets, Porges said in his note to clients. Those won't be enough to diversify Gilead from the hepatitis C ""roller coaster"" even with the help of its nascent HIV drug bictegravir.""It has been apparent that Gilead would need major acquisitions since 2015, and possibly even before then, and it is inexplicable to us that the company has been so faint-hearted in exercising their cash-flow advantage until now,"" he said. ""The company still appears to be responding to opportunities presented to them, rather than initiating and creating opportunities ahead of their availability.""Even if Gilead went after any of the obvious oncology assets, investors will question why the company is paying a premium today when the potential of those companies was apparent last year when prices were 25% to 500% below their current levels.Porges has a market perform rating and 74 price target on Gilead stock. Its valuation, he says, is at an all-time low and would otherwise justify a recommendation. But ""substantial termination uncertainty makes it hard for us to see the stock recovering its multiple in the foreseeable future.""By the closing bell on the stock market today, Gilead stock dipped a fraction, near 70.78. Vertex popped as much as 4%, though settled to be up 1.3% to 128.87. Incyte stock fell 2.2% to 125.91, while Tesaro stock lost 0.8% to 139.86.RELATED:Why The Biotech Rally Could Still Tack On Another 15% UpsideAre Sanofi, Gilead In A Bidding War Over This Small-Cap BiotechEven An Upgrade Couldn't Save Vertex From The Biotech Deluge

61,INCY,"AstraZeneca's (AZN) advanced lung cancer trial could benefit rival Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), leaving Dow component Merck (MRK) to twirl in the wind, an analyst said Thursday ahead of a key data readout.But Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez only gives AstraZeneca's trial a 15% chance of hitting a ""grand slam."" Instead, it's 25% likely the trial will result in a ""strikeout,"" he said in a report before AstraZeneca reveals the results of its trial dubbed Mystic later this year.Wall Street reactions to Fernandez's assessment were fairly muted on the stock market today. Merck stock fell 1.3% to close at 64.34. AstraZeneca and Bristol stocks slipped marginally to 34.12 and 55.82, respectively.The Mystic trial is evaluating a combination of AstraZeneca's drugs Imfinzi and tremelimumab vs. chemotherapy in patients with advanced lung cancer. The trial is testing a long-standing theory that coupling immuno-oncology drugs could offer a better cancer defense.Imfinzi is what's known as a PD-L1 inhibitor. It works by blocking an interaction involving the PD-L1 protein in the immune system. Tremelimumab is called an anti-CTLA-4 inhibitor. It works to block a different interaction in the body.AstraZeneca is testing whether patients with more of that PD-L1 protein will have a stronger reaction to the combination drug. Fernandez sees just a 15% chance the combo will work in all patients regardless of how many PD-L1 proteins their bodies have.IBD'S TAKE: Cancer-focused biotechs were riding high earlier this month during a sectorwide boom. Meanwhile, Incyte (INCY) stock has been consolidating since mid-March. Could the biotech rally lead it to a breakout? Head to IBD Data Stories for a closer look.However it falls, the trial will have implications for Bristol, he said. In a separate trial, Bristol is testing its drugs Opdivo and Yervoy in advanced lung cancer. Yervoy is similar to tremelimumab. Opdivo is known as a PD-1 inhibitor, which has a slightly different mechanism from Imfinzi.""Mystic is a clear binary event for AstraZeneca and — to some degree — Bristol as well,"" he said. Bristol's trial is also testing its immuno-oncology combination vs. chemotherapy in patients with advanced lung cancer. Data are expected later this year.Though a ""grand slam"" is the least likely scenario, in that instance Fernandez says AstraZeneca and Bristol could expect to split the advanced lung cancer market in immuno-oncology combos, leaving Merck to lead the monotherapy market with its Keytruda.Merck is testing Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy. It's also looking at a combination of Keytruda with Incyte's epacadostat, which is known as an IDO inhibitor. Keytruda is similar to Opdivo in that it's also a PD-1 inhibitor.Roche (RHHBY), meanwhile, is looking at a combination of its drugs Tecentriq and Avastin with chemo. Tecentriq is also a PD-L1 inhibitor like AstraZeneca's Imfinzi. Top-line results from that trial are expected in the third quarter.""We assume a modest peak share for Roche with an as-yet-to-be-determined combo,"" Fernandez said. ""Among immuno-oncology plus chemo regimens, we anticipate Merck to dominate followed by Roche and Bristol.""He noted, however, a win in the Mystic trial would ""negatively influence the potential for Merck and Roche's immuno-oncology plus chemo combos.""If the Mystic trial isn't successful, Fernandez sees a 13% downside for AstraZeneca. He sees a 16% upside, though, is the trial succeeds. In the slim chance AstraZeneca's combo works in all patients regardless of protein expression, it would set a high competitive bar for Bristol's combo.RELATED:How Dow's Merck Is Still Leading Bristol, Roche In Immuno-OncologyCould Tesaro Overcome Clovis' Lead On Combos With Merck & Co.?Biotech Flew Nearly 50% On Strong Trial — But Is Its Drug Better?

65,INCY,"Dow component Merck (MRK) rose above the fray during a month-over-month decrease in immuno-oncology sales throughout the industry, swiping share from rival Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) as Roche (RHHBY) remained flat, industry analysts said Wednesday.Four immuno-oncology drugs from Merck, Bristol-Myers and Roche brought in $464 million in February, declining 4% from $483 million in January, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said, citing data from tracker Symphony Health.But February was a shorter month, which could be partly responsible for the decrease, Fernandez said in a research report. Despite the slowdown, Merck's Keytruda sales grew 2% in February vs. the prior month.Meanwhile, Bristol-Myers' drugs Opdivo and Yervoy held on to a collective 69% market share, falling 1% vs. January. Merck's Keytruda now has 24% of the market, up from 23% the prior month. Roche's Tecentriq was flat at 7% share.Immuno-oncology drugs fight cancer by teaching the body's immune system to identify cancer cells hiding behind specific proteins. Those proteins are called checkpoints.A number of checkpoints are being explored by AstraZeneca (AZN), Incyte (INCY) and others. Keytruda and Opdivo, the immuno-oncology market leaders, are also direct rivals. Both target the interaction between a PD-1 protein on an immune system cell and the PD-L1 protein on a cancer cell. Doing so allows the immune system to identify and destroy the cancer cell.Both are approved to treat advanced lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, and classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Opdivo is also approved in kidney cancer and bladder cancer.Yervoy, from Bristol-Myers, targets the CTLA-4 checkpoint. Roche's Tecentriq targets the PD-L1 protein on a cancer cell. Yervoy is approved to treat melanoma. Tecentriq is approved in lung cancer and bladder cancer.IBD'S TAKE: What if your body could fight off cancer the way it fights common germs? It's happening. Head to IBD's Technology page for a breakdown on these new drugs.Merck's Keytruda saw a spike in sales in July 2016 after a key trial showed Keytruda is superior to chemotherapy in improving progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with advanced lung cancer. The trial was stopped early on strong efficacy.Keytruda was approved in October for first-line advanced lung cancer for patients with a heavier concentrations of PD-L1 protein in their systems. Since then, ""we continue to see a steady increase in U.S. sales estimates and market share,"" Fernandez said.Tecentriq is also putting additional pressure on Opdivo following its approval as a second-line treatment for some advanced lung cancer patients in October, he said. But growth in Opdivo's newer approvals (liver cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, head and neck cancer, and bladder cancer) should help offset that trend.Merck stock finished 0.6% lower at 63.50 on the stock market today, as shares of Bristol-Myers rose 1.2% to 56.36.

Bristol will pay Cytomx $200 million upfront and provide research funding.Cytomx will be eligible to receive up to $448 million in future development, regulatory and sales milestones, plus royalties of mid-single to low-double digits on Bristol's sales of each product commercialized under the agreement.The deal capitalizes on Bristol-Myers' position in the immuno-oncology market where it is facing off against the likes of Merck (MRK), Roche (RHHBY), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Incyte (INCY).IBD'S TAKE: Analysts say there are north of a thousand immuno-oncology drugs being tested right now. But only a small handful have been approved. Head to IBD's Technology page for the full list.Immuno-oncology drugs teach the body's immune system to identify camouflaged cancer cells by targeting specific proteins. Those proteins are called checkpoints. In total, Bristol and Cytomx will be exploring up to 12 immuno-oncology checkpoints.One particular checkpoint, called CTLA-4, has proved successful for Bristol. Yervoy targets the CTLA-4 protein. It is approved to treat melanoma that has spread or cannot be treated by surgery.Cytomx and Bristol are working to move another CTLA-4 drug into clinical trials. The duo also has a drug that targets the PD-1 protein — similar to Bristol's Opdivo and Merck's Keytruda — in a combined phase 1 and 2 trial.RELATED:Merck Could Be Nearing This Rival With Another Keytruda ApprovalIncyte Spikes To Record High On Rumors Gilead Could Acquire ItThis Pharma Firm Is Beating The Pack In Getting Drugs To Market

68,INCY,"The major indexes mainly treaded water late in Tuesday's relatively quiet session. The Dow Jones industrial average, however, is showing bullish action by maintaining strength at its 50-day moving average.The Dow Jones industrials, enjoying strong gains by the likes of industrial giants Caterpillar (CAT) and United Technologies (UTX), edged up around 0.1% during a day of narrow-range trading. That's in contrast with Monday, in which the 30-stock blue-chip index fell to an intraday low of 20,517, but bounced higher after a challenge of support at the key 50-day moving average.The Dow showed an earlier test of strength at this intermediate-term support line on March 27.Cat tried, but failed on Tuesday to climb back above its 50-day moving average. Leading stocks tend to travel above their 50-day lines in preparation for a potential breakout. The good news for Cat shareholders is that the stock is trading less than 6% below its 52-week high of 99.46.United Tech, meanwhile, has made limited upside progress since the stock rallied past a 109.52 cup-with-handle entry point in late November and early December.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite were practically flat. However, losing stocks were outpacing winning issues by a nearly 4-to-3 margin on the Nasdaq. On the NYSE, winners and losers were roughly evenly matched. The Russell 2000 lost 0.2%.Volume was running mildly lower vs. the same time Monday on both main exchanges.While the medical sector remains a laggard, here are four stocks to consider for your watchlist. PRA Health (PRAH) is ranked No. 32 on the IBD 50. The stock edged 0.2% lower to 64.62, but is showing gains after busting through stubborn resistance at 60.The Raleigh, N.C., clinical trials firm has grown earnings per share 108%, 74%, 34%, 34%, 23% and 20% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters. Due in part to a tough year-over-year comparison, Wall Street sees earnings up just 9%, to 60 cents a share, in Q1.PRA holds a good 94 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99 from IBD Stock Checkup.Celgene (CELG) has been trading quietly lately, but at 124.35 the top-performing biotech is still up nominally from a Feb. 28 breakout past a 122.49 cup-with-handle entry.Celgene is trading firmly above its 50-day moving average, which itself has been rising for more than six weeks. A 73 Relative Price Strength Rating is not superb, but it's a meaningful improvement from as low as 35 eight weeks ago. A 73 RS rating means that the large-cap biotech, which specializes in treatments for cancer and immunological disorders, is now outperforming 73% of all stocks in IBD's database over the past 12 months.Other notable leaders in IBD's biotech group are Incyte (INCY) and small-cap epilepsy and ADHD specialist Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN). Both are up sharply for the year so far. A fourth  member of the biotech group is Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), which rose 4% to 111.45 in heavy trading, four days after it zoomed up 20% in massive trading on positive clinical trial data regarding its two-pill treatment for cystic fibrosis.And Loveland, Colo.-based Heska (HSKA), a thinly traded expert in veterinary products, continues to soar after it cleared a 57.51 buy point in huge volume on Nov. 1.Keep in mind that Heska, up 2% to 104.37, trades just 102,000 shares a day. Elsewhere in the stock market today, InterActiveCorp (IAC) roared off its 50-day line, rising more than 2% to 75.73 in heavy volume.The search engine operator has found nice support at its 50-day for months, after the stock cleared a 60.40 buy point within a long bottoming-base pattern in October last year.On Feb. 2, InterActiveCorp staged a profit turnaround with fourth-quarter earnings rising 84% to $1.38 a share, crushing the consensus analyst estimate by nearly 47%, despite a 4% drop in sales. That halted a four-quarter streak of shrinking profits.Now, Wall Street has revised full-year EPS estimates higher, with 2017 earnings seen up 13% to $3.34 a share and 2018 earnings up 32% to $4.41.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Is It Time To Take Profits In These 5 Leading Techs?The Income Investor: Will These 3 Dividend Leaders Finish Big In 2017?Inside The IBD 50: These 7 Leaders Are Thriving, Even After Testing The 10-Week Moving Average

69,INCY,"The Food and Drug Administration has approved Merck's (MRK) Keytruda to treat classical Hodgkin lymphoma, but needs more time to review the drugmaker's application for Keytruda in a DNA repair disorder tied to several colorectal cancers.Merck announced the developments late Tuesday. The FDA gave Merck the OK to sell Keytruda as a treatment for children and adults whose classical Hodgkin lymphoma has relapsed after three or more prior treatments.But the FDA needs more time to examine Keytruda as a treatment for previously treated microsatellite instability-high cancer. The disorder is caused by a deficiency in the DNA repair sequence, leading to cancer.""We believe that patients whose tumors harbor DNA repair defect may be especially responsive to Keytruda,"" Merck said in November when it first applied to have the FDA consider Keytruda as a treatment for the disorder.The new Prescription Drug Fee User Act date for Keytruda in microsatellite instability-high cancer is set for June 9.IBD'S TAKE: What if your body could target cancer the way it does common bacteria? It's no longer theoretical. Dive in with this feature on the immuno-oncology space on IBD's Technology page.Keytruda competes directly with Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Opdivo in melanoma, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, and now classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Both drugs belong to a class of drugs that use the body's immune system to fight cancer.Specifically, Keytruda and Opdivo aim to block the interaction between a PD-1 protein on an immune system cell and the PD-L1 protein on a cancer cell. Doing so allows the immune system to identify the cancer cell and destroy it.AstraZeneca (AZN), Roche (RHHBY) and Incyte (INCY) are also working on varying checkpoints. Roche's FDA-approved Tecentriq targets the PD-L1 protein on the surface of the cancer cell. Incyte's epacadostat belongs to another class, targeting IDO enzymes. Bristol's Yervoy works similarly, targeting the CTLA-4 protein.Merck stock closed up 0.8% at 64.70 on the stock market today. Shares of Bristol-Myers rose 1.7% to 57.65, after Bristol gave a presentation at the Barclays Global Healthcare Conference.RELATED: Could Merck's 'Meaningful' Keytruda Royalty Give Bristol-Myers A Leg Up?Merck, Roche Gouge Bristol's I-O Share After Lung Cancer Approvals

71,INCY,"Celgene (CELG) could rival Dow component Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) in cancer-fighting drugs, an analyst said after the No. 2 biotech announced a $413 million deal, giving it access to a key immuno-oncology treatment.XUnder the terms of the deal, Celgene will pay BeiGene (BGNE) $263 million in upfront license fees and make a $150 million equity investment to acquire the rights to develop the drug known as BGB-A317 in solid tumors across the globe.BGB-A317 belongs to a class of immuno-oncology drugs called PD-1 inhibitors. These drugs, including Merck's Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo, work to block a specific interaction involving the PD-1 protein in body that would prevent an immune response to cancer cells.The deals allows Celgene to develop and commercialize BGB-A317 to treat solid tumors in the U.S., Europe, Japan and the rest of the world outside of Asia. BeiGene keeps the rights to its drug for blood cancers worldwide and for solid tumors in Asia.Celgene already has an immuno-oncology play in blood cancers with its acquisition of the rights to AstraZeneca's (AZN) Imfinzi in hematological tumors in 2015, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said. He called the deal a small upfront cost to get access to a PD-1 inhibitor beginning trials next year.Also within the deal, BeiGene will acquire Celgene's commercial operations in China and an exclusive license to commercialize cancer drugs Abraxane, Revlimid and Vidaza in China, Celgene said in a news release early Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: Several drugmakers are working to create CAR-T therapies, an individualized form of immuno-oncology, in which the immune system to reprogrammed to fight cancer. Who's leading the sector? Head to the Industry Snapshot.The deal comes a day after the Food and Drug Administration put three of Merck's Keytruda trials on hold after several patient deaths. Celgene was partnered in those trials. Still, questions linger regarding how much Celgene is willing to put in to finish development of BGB-A317, Raffat said.""From Celgene's perspective, (it's) very important to understand how big a (research and development) undertaking this will be and how many additional immuno-oncology targets it will look to bring in for potential combos,"" he wrote in a note to clients.A number of companies, Merck and Bristol included, are working to combine their immuno-oncology drugs with others to boost their potency. BeiGene, though, says its PD-1 inhibitor is more efficient because it's been engineered to minimize interactions with other targets outside the PD-1 protein.Celgene is working on a number of immuno-oncology targets outside of PD-1. But Raffat expects it will need to add more, including an IDO inhibitor like Incyte's (INCY) epacadostat or a CTLA-4 inhibitor like Bristol's Yervoy.On the stock market today, Celgene stock dipped nearly 1% to close at 131.95. Shares of Merck fell 1.7% to 63.10, as Bristol-Myers stock slid 1.9% to finish at 55.28. BeiGene stock, though, rocketed 26.8% to end the regular session at 66.28, a record close.

72,INCY,"Roche (RHHBY) returned the rights to a licensed immuno-oncology drug back to NewLink Genetics (NLNK), but analysts say that shouldn't impact Incyte (INCY), which has a rival drug in trials with Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).On the stock market today, NewLink stock popped as much as 10%, and was up 3.5% to 6.46. Incyte stock fell 0.6% to 119.04, trailing Bristol stock, which was up 1.7% to 53.75. Roche stock advanced 0.3% to 32.01.NewLink's drug, dubbed GDC-0919, is what's known as an IDO inhibitor, which works to block anything that would prevent an immune response to cancer cells. It was combined with Roche's atezolizumab, what's called a PD-1 inhibitor, but the effectivness of the combination was low.The results weren't as robust as a similar combination from Merck's Keytruda and Incyte's still-unapproved epacadostat. Incyte is also combining epacadostat with Bristol's Opdivo. Bristol, too, is working on its own IDO inhibitor.IBD'S TAKE: Incyte stock could be prepping for a breakout. Shares began consolidating in mid-March with a buy point at 153.25. Head to IBD Data Stories for a closer look at the indications surrounding Incyte shares.""We are not surprised that Roche returned GDC-0919 (their IDO inhibitor) to NewLink after seeing the disappointing data at ASCO (the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference) with atezolizumab,"" Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young said.Young kept her outperform rating and 152 price target on Incyte stock, saying she doesn't expect Roche returning NewLink's IDO inhibitor to have any impact on Incyte.RELATED:Dow's Merck 'Clearly Won' Vs.

Indian full-service carrier Jet Airways also is reportedly in talks to purchase 50 narrow-body jets worth at least $5.6 billion and is leaning toward the 737 Max 10 or Max 200 vs. the Airbus (EADSY) A321neo, according to Bloomberg.Gigamon (GIMO) hired Goldman Sachs to explore strategic options a few weeks after activist investor Elliott Management took a 15% stake in the maker of communications-network appliances and security gear. Gigamon could draw interest from Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) or private equity firms, one analyst said.Software maker Coupa (COUP) reported a narrower fiscal Q1 loss with revenue rising 41% to $41 million, topping consensus estimates. For the current quarter, Coupa forecast a per-share loss of 19 cents, in-line with estimates, and revenue of about $41.5 million, slightly above views.Snap (SNAP) fell 14% on reports that Snapchat user growth has been slowing in the second quarter.Okta (OKTA) reported a smaller-than-expected loss and above-forecast revenue growth in its identity-security software stock's first report since coming public in April. Okta shares rose nearly 9% through Thursday, hitting a record high and breaking out of an initial IPO base. But shares reversed Friday, ending the week little changed.Thor Industries (THO) EPS rose 40% and revenue climbed 57% to $2.02 billion, beating on both. The maker of RVs and mobile homes rose about 9%.General Motors (GM) shareholders overwhelmingly rejected an activist investor's call to create two share classes, one focused on growth and another on dividends. They also re-elected all 11 board members, rejecting three nominees put forward by Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn.

88,INCY,"Incyte (INCY) stock enjoyed a fifth consecutive day of gains Friday after its immuno-oncology drug, epacadostat, proved robust in combination trials with Dow component Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).Between the two, Merck's Keytruda and Bristol-Myers' Opdivo were tested in combination with Incyte's epacadostat in eight forms of cancer. Among those, Bristol-Myers' matchup in melanoma grabbed the best response and disease control rates.At the 100-milligram dose, melanoma patients treated with the Opdivo and epacadostat combination saw a 75% response rate and a 100% disease control rate, according to Janney analyst Debjit Chattopadhyay.Merck's top response rate was 47% in kidney cancer with its best disease control rate at 63% in bladder cancer. But melanoma is well known to be an immuno-oncology sensitive disease. Bristol's Opdivo and Yervoy are approved jointly to treat some forms of melanoma.The results were released ahead of the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting next month in Chicago. In total, Merck tested Keytruda and epacadostat in six types of cancer at varying doses.IBD'S TAKE: Keep tabs on IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News page as more from the American Society of Clinical Oncology pulls new headlines.In head and neck cancer, Opdivo plus epacadostat achieved a 70% disease control rate. Merck's Keytruda with epacadostat hit a 62% disease control rate in patients who had already undergone two prior therapies, and 43% in patients who'd already been treated three times.Kidney cancer is ""clearly"" an immuno-oncology sensitive tumor type, Chattopadhyay wrote in a note to clients. The combination of Keytruda and epacadostat had 47% response and 58% disease control rates in patients who'd either never been treated or had one prior therapy.In bladder cancer, 35% of patients treated with Keytruda and epacadostat responded to treatment with the disease under control for 57% of patients. The numbers for breast cancer, though, were less robust. Response rates hit 9%-12% with disease control rates of 29%-41%.Bristol and Roche (RHHBY) are also combining their immuno-oncology drugs with Nektar Therapeutics' (NKTR) drug known as NKTR-214. The drug is what's known as a CD122-biased agonist which grows cancer-killing immune system and ""natural killer"" cells within a patient's body.Chattopadhyay kept a buy rating on Nektar stock, though noted data are still early. Bristol and Nektar are looking at Opdivo and NKTR-214 in five tumor types. Roche's Tecentriq is being combined with NKTR-214 in lung and bladder cancer.More data are expected from Tesaro's (TSRO) combination with Merck during the conference in June. Tesaro's Zejula, which is what's known as a PARP inhibitor, is being combined with Merck's Keytruda in breast cancer.Though it won't be the first ""hints"" of what an immuno-oncology-PARP inhibitor pairing could do, Chattopadhyay said. BeiGene, looked at a similar combination in 38 patients. The match, a PARP inhibitor and what's known as a PD-1 inhibitor, decreased tumor burden in 16 patients.At least one patient in BeiGene's (BGNE) trial went into remission with partial responses from seven patients. The trial looked at patients with ovarian, uterine and pancreatic cancer. But the overall response rate of 21% was just shy of the 30% ""needed to justify a Phase 3 program, in our view,"" Chattopadhyay said.Incyte stock closed 2% higher at 131.43 on the stock market today, after rising 6.9% on Thursday. Bristol edged up 0.45% to 54.02. Merck, a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, inched down 0.2% to 63.78.RELATED:Incyte Teams Up With Dow's Merck To Trounce Roche In CancerMerck's Immuno-Oncology Star Tacks On 2 New Bladder Cancer ApprovalsConference Spotlights Drug Giant Donnybrooks In Cancer Treatments

90,INCY,"X Incyte (INCY) stock popped to a month-high Thursday after its immuno-oncology drug proved effective in matchups with Merck's (MRK) Keytruda and Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Opdivo — removing ""a small overhang on Incyte stock.""Roche (RHHBY) and NewLink Genetics (NLNK) stocks, on the other hand, toppled after their combination proved less effective than Merck and Incyte's.At the close on the stock market today, Incyte stock ended trading up 6.9% to 128.80, after earlier rising as high as 131.75, nearing its 50-day moving average. Shares of Dow component Merck jumped 1.4% to 63.89. But Bristol stock sank 1.2% to 53.78.The team-ups feature Incyte's epacadostat, which is known as an IDO inhibitor. The drug works to block the interaction between the IDO enzyme and the immune system to help the immune system identify hiding cancer cells.Merck's Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo are PD-1 inhibitors which work to block the interaction between a PD-1 protein on an immune system cell and a PD-L1 protein hiding a cancer cell. Doing so helps the immune system see the cancer cell for what it is and destroy it.Coupling immuno-oncology drugs with varying targets is thought to be especially potent. But these are among the first trials to prove the concept using an IDO inhibitor. Bristol's Yervoy is a CTLA-4 inhibitor and has been paired effectively with Opdivo in melanoma patients.In trials, Merck's Keytruda and Incyte's epacadostat achieved an overall response rate of 35% in all patients regardless their specific biomarkers. In patients who carry a lot of the PD-L1 protein, the combination saw an overall response rate of 43%.For Bristol-Myers, the data released before the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in June was a ""nonevent"" as the most interesting efficacy data will be released during the actual conference, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said.IBD'S TAKE: The immuno-oncology market could be worth $25 billion by 2025 just looking at known inhibitors. Head to IBD's Technology page for a breakdown of the emerging sector.Preliminarily, Bristol's Opdivo and Incyte's epacadostat achieved a 75% overall response rate in its 100-milligram dose. That's consistent with early data from Merck and Incyte's combo ""suggesting that both PD-1s perform similarly in combination with epacadostat,"" he said.During the conference, Bristol also plans to unveil further data from its combination of Opdivo and Yervoy in advanced lung cancer. It's further planning to release initial data on an array of inhibitors still in development.Shares of Roche fell 0.7% to 33.80. NewLink stock plunged 9.1% to 14.64. Roche licensed NewLink's IDO inhibitor for a combination with its drug Tecentriq, a PD-L1 inhibitor.The data is very immature, Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt wrote in a note to clients. Initially, it appears NewLink's IDO inhibitor, known as GDC-919, is less potent than epacadostat across six tumor types. The combo achieved a partial response in 9% of patients.RELATED:Will Incyte Shine Under Oncology Spotlight With Dow's Merck, Bristol?AstraZeneca Has Opportunity In Lung Cancer Treatment Vs.

91,INCY,"Incyte's (INCY) immuno-oncology partnerships with Dow component Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) will grab the spotlight at the American Association of Clinical Oncology meeting next month in Chicago, an analyst said Monday.But Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt said Incyte's epacadostat, a cancer treatment, is facing an uphill battle when used as a combination with Merck's Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo. Epacadostat is what's known as an IDO inhibitor, which blocks an interaction between the immune system and tumor cells.Keytruda and Opdivo are what's known as PD-1 inhibitors. They block a different interaction to help the immune system ""see"" the cancer. Bristol-Myers has already shown combining Opdivo and Yervoy, a CTLA-4 inhibitor, to be potent in treating melanoma.Physicians generally expect adding Incyte's epacadostat to Merck's Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo to offer an improvement over those drugs as therapies by themselves.But ""the general view has been that meeting or exceeding anti-CTLA-4/PD-1-like synergies represents a very high bar for an immuno-oncology combination in development,"" Schmidt wrote in a note to clients.Merck, a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, teamed up with Incyte in a number of tumor trials. At the conference, Merck and Incyte will present data from combination trials in tests to treat cancer of the lung, breast, kidney, bladder, head and neck, as well as solid tumors.Bristol is set to unveil the results of a trial of Opdivo and epacadostat in advanced solid tumors. In April, Incyte and Bristol announced they would advance epacadostat and Opdivo in several registration trials in 2017 including lung cancer and head and neck cancer.IBD'S TAKE: The immuno-oncology market could be worth $25 billion in 2025, an analyst told Investor's Business Daily. And it's still expanding. Visit IBD's Technology page for a breakdown of who is — and could — compete in the race.Schmidt estimates epacadostat is worth $32, or 28%, of Incyte's stock price. On the stock market today, Incyte stock rose 1.9% to 117.35. Bristol stock lifted 0.1% to 55.10, as Merck stock sank 0.1% to 63.51.""We think 10%-15% downside is plausible if epacadostat data disappoint investors,"" he wrote. ""Conversely, we see 10%-15% upside if data surprise on the upside following the recent pullback.""He has a 134 price target on Incyte stock based on a bullish outlook for epacadostat — which is also being tested with drugs from AstraZeneca (AZN) and Roche (RHHBY) — and assumes $2.7 billion in peak epacadostat sales in 2030.RELATED:Is Bristol Prepping To Outdo Itself In Immuno-Oncology?Bristol 'Can't Afford To Lose' To Dow Stock Merck In Immuno-OncologyWill Bristol Prove This Longtime Theory In Cancer Defense?

93,INCY,"Incyte (INCY) stock toppled to a 10-week low Friday on a fourth consecutive quarter of losses, but it was curiously among a slew of biotechs to grab bullish reports from a Credit Suisse analyst in the wake of earnings.Analyst Alethia Young kept her outperform rating on Incyte stock, saying the company's chemotherapy drug, Jakafi, will pull in $1.068 billion in 2017 sales, growing to $1.86 billion in 2022. On Thursday, Incyte said it expected $1.02 billion to $1.07 billion in 2017 sales of Jakafi. The biotech also announced adjusted losses of 96 cents a share, slightly better than views for a $1 loss.""The company mentioned that close to 10,000 patients are now on therapy but there is still room to grow in penetrating the prevalences further,"" she wrote in a note to clients. Incyte is now looking at Jakafi to treat graft-versus-host disease, when the body rejects foreign tissue like an organ transplant.But Young lowered her expectations for Incyte's earnings this year and next. She sees 87 cents and 50 cents, respectively, down from views for $1.23 and $1.Incyte fell 2.1% to 122.41 on the stock market today.Young is also outperform-rated on Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) stock. Like Incyte's Jakafi, a key drug from Intercept to treat liver disease, Ocaliva, beat expectations in the first quarter. Sales of Ocaliva came in at $20.6 million, topping views for $15 million.""Weekly Ocaliva prescriptions have steadily increased and were averaging out at a rate of about 300 scripts per week,"" she wrote. ""We think that the IMS (health care tracker) scripts give good visibility into trends on a weekly basis.""IBD'S TAKE: Keeping up with the biotech sector can be tricky.

The analyst boosted her price target on Intercept stock to 201 from 198.

The firm, though, noted some seasonality in sales of Alprolix, a coagulant approved to treat hemophilia B. Alprolix sales came in at $86 million, up 14.7% from the year-earlier quarter.Young models $1.06 billion in 2017 sales, though notes early trends suggest potential upside in strong patient trends continue.""We have gotten questions around weakness in the stock, but we didn't see anything from the call to drive weakness,"" she wrote in a note. ""We remain cautious long-term around competitive risks from other hemophilia players that could impact their base business.""Bioverativ stock climbed 1.8% to 56.22.BioMarin Pharmaceuticals (BMRN), too, had a ""strong quarter on the top and bottom line,"" she said.

94,INCY,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Biogen (BIIB) would benefit the most among biotechs under President Trump's proposed tax reform, a measure that would cut the corporate tax rate by 20%.Under Trump's proposal ""no business of any size, from a Fortune 500 to a mom-and-pop shop to a freelancer living job to job, will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes,"" making corporate inversions unnecessary."" The U.S. corporate tax rate is currently 35%.That means Regeneron, Gilead and Biogen — all of which have guided to adjusted tax rates at or above 25% in 2017 — could see a serious boost in cash if Trump's proposal passes. Though, analysts say, it's all about compromise inside the Beltway, so that 15% rate is still up in the air.Trump's approval rating jumped to 39% in May from 34% in April, and he gained 7% in the IBD/TIPP Presidential Leadership Index after unveiling his tax reform proposal. It was the first month-over-month increase since Trump became president.But that doesn't mean Big Pharma and biotech are totally sold on Trump's proposal — a four-page document released April 26. Shares of biotechs and drugmakers collectively lifted less than 1% that day, though generic drug stocks popped 2.8%.Gilead Chief Executive John Milligan noted uncertainty in Washington is the norm.""So I think we've kind of learned to filter that out and focus on the things that are right for the company,"" he said on Gilead's May 2 first-quarter earnings conference call. ""There may be tax reform. There may be repatriation. But you can't count on it and you can't wait for it, either.""Trump's plan would slash the U.S. corporate tax rate to 15% from 35%, benefiting companies whose consolidated tax rates remain well above that level. Consolidating taxes allows a firm to treat a group of wholly- or majority-owned companies as a single entity for tax purposes.U.S.-domiciled drugmakers typically pay 37%-40% in consolidated taxes, Canaccord analyst Dewey Steadman told Investor's Business Daily. But companies that acquire a foreign firm can move their tax domicile outside the U.S. to the acquired company's often lower-tax homeland.When Mylan (MYL) acquired a generics manufacturer from Abbott Laboratories (ABT) in 2014, it kept its operational headquarters in Pennsylvania, but reincorporated in the Netherlands. In March, Mylan said it expected to pay a 16.5%-18.5% tax rate in 2017.Similarly, Allergan (AGN) guided in February to a 13.5% adjusted tax rate in 2017. Allergan's corporate headquarters are in Ireland. In April 2016, Pfizer (PFE) scrapped its $160 billion attempt to acquire Allergan a day after the U.S. Treasury unveiled new rules to curb inversions.Former President Barack Obama called global tax avoidance a ""huge problem"" and urged Congress to close the loophole for good. Trump, on the other hand, says his tax reform proposal would make inversions unnecessary ""by making America's tax rate one of the best in the world.""Regeneron, Gilead and Biogen would be among the biggest winners of this cut, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in an April 26 report. Regeneron has guided to an effective tax rate of 32%-38% in 2017. Gilead sees 25%-28%. In the first quarter, Biogen paid 23% in adjusted taxes.Among drugmakers, Pfizer, Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) all guided to effective tax rates between 20%-25% for 2017. Canaccord's Steadman and Mizuho analyst Salim Syed told IBD everything in politics is subject to negotiation.""Smaller biotechs say it's obviously positive for the future, but everyone is taking a wait-and-see approach,"" Steadman said. ""A 20%-22% rate is probably what's going to happen, but they're not changing their capital expenditures or organizational structure in the meantime.""IBD'S TAKE: Looking for the latest on biotech and drug news? Be sure to bookmark IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News page.A second facet of Trump's plan would allow the one-time repatriation of corporate cash parked overseas at a discounted 10% tax rate. This would be followed by an end to the deferral of taxes on corporate income earned abroad.Evercore's Raffat says Amgen (AMGN) would benefit the most among drugmakers under this provision. Amgen has $34.4 billion in cash stashed overseas. That's money Amgen could use to help boost its war chest amid generic rivalries and a battle with Regeneron/Sanofi (SNY) on the cholesterol front.The same could be said for Gilead — $27.4 billion in overseas cash — which is facing dwindling sales in its hepatitis C drug franchise. Gilead had been under pressure for months amid analyst chatter that it should buy something to bolster sales. Incyte (INCY) is a likely candidate, analysts say.According to Raffat, Merck and Pfizer have a respective $21.9 billion and $15 billion in cash outside the U.S. Lilly, Bristol, Celgene (CELG), Biogen and AbbVie (ABBV) each have under $10 billion parked overseas. That cash could be repatriated for research and development, or used to fuel M&A.Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read offered a similar view as Gilead's Milligan on the company's May 2 first-quarter earnings conference call. Though he expects industry consolidation to continue over time, the political atmosphere remains a major deterrent.""I believe there is simply too much redundancy and fragmentation, both globally and in the U.S., for the sector to continually efficiently deliver medicines to society,"" he said. ""However, there is a lack of clarity on potential tax reform, health care policies of the U.S. and uncertainties in the European markets.""Canaccord's Steadman doesn't expect a wave of M&A even if Trump's tax reform passes muster with Congress. There's no need to attempt Pfizer-Allergan-like mergers for inversion purposes, he said. Though the appetite for U.S. biotechs looks healthy.""We'd see a decline in those big inversion-type mergers that were not necessarily strategic, but you could see an appetite for U.S. biotech assets just because the tax picture looks better,"" he said. ""The net result is actually a decrease in large mergers but maybe an increase in valuations for biotech, but I don't think it drives much more M&A.""There's much that's still murky in Trump's tax proposal, analysts say.""The general theme is tax reform would be a good thing for biotech,"" Mizuho's Syed told IBD. ""But we don't exactly know what tax reform is going to be. There are still a lot of pieces moving around. Repatriation? A border tax? We don't have all the components of it.""A border tax, though, could be an extreme drawback for U.S. companies with manufacturing in less expensive countries. Such an adjustment could exempt exports from taxation, while taxing imports, PwC analysts Doug Strang and Kathy Michael wrote in a Feb. 6 report.In a January speech at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said a tax would eliminate the tax incentives for U.S. companies to move their manufacturing overseas.""Coupled with the new lower GOP tax rates on local businesses and ending double-taxation of U.S. earnings overseas, this establishes America as a 21st century magnet for new jobs, technology breakthroughs and headquarters,"" he said. ""The GOP tax plan is already driving companies to ask themselves, 'How soon can we bring our suppliers back to the U.S.?'""For most companies, relocating their operations back to the U.S. would be a ""paperwork nightmare,"" Canaccord's Steadman said. In the current plan — which doesn't include a border tax provision — there's nothing to incentivize companies to bring operations back to the U.S.But it could be enough to keep newer and smaller companies from re-domiciling overseas, he said.""It's probably enticing future companies to not leave the U.S., I think that's the core goal of what they're trying to do,"" he said. ""If they were U.S.-domiciled at a lower rate, they wouldn't have to leave cash in a foreign subsidiary and that cash would be based in the U.S. which would encourage investment in the U.S.""RELATED:Did Gilead Just Provide Some 'Incyte' Into A Potential Deal?Dow's Pfizer Tops Earnings Views But Sales Come Up ShortHow Lilly's New Drug Could Spark A Deeper Rivalry With Pfizer, Novartis

95,INCY,"Clovis Oncology's (CLVS) Rubraca label is ""cleanest,"" an analyst said Tuesday, a day after the FDA approved Tesaro's (TSRO) Zejula in ovarian cancer but with requirements for frequent bone marrow and heart monitoring.It's also likely that Clovis' Rubraca could gain a similarly broad label — rivaling Tesaro's Zejula also in fallopian and peritoneal cancers — if competitive efficacy is established in a late-stage trial expected mid-2017, Credit Suisse analyst Kennen MacKay said.At the closing bell on the stock market today, Clovis stock dropped 1.8% to 67.06. Tesaro, meanwhile, lost 1.2% to 154.90, giving back gains of as much as 6.9%. Rival AstraZeneca (AZN) lost 1.5% to 31.33.That followed Tesaro's announcement late Monday that the FDA had approved Zejula (niraparib) for patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, fallopian and primary peritoneal cancers. But the label requires blood counts be monitored weekly for the first month and then monthly for 11 months.""We note that Zejula's bone marrow suppression warnings are in line with intensive platinum-based chemotherapy treatments,"" MacKay wrote in a note to clients. ""While we see gynecologic oncologists as highly experienced with monitoring marrow suppression, we see potential for Rubraca to differentiate based on safety.""MacKay has an outperform rating and 74 price target on Clovis stock.IBD'S TAKE: Tesaro is expected to be a top performer in 2017 if the stock's 2016 performance is any indication. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a breakdown of the leaders.Tesaro will also combine Zejula with an immuno-oncology drug in first-line ovarian cancer, triple-negative breast cancer and advanced lung cancer. Merck (MRK), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Roche (RHHBY) have FDA-approved immuno-oncology drugs.""Management did not disclose which PD-1 antibody will be used or whether these trials would be conducted as part of a collaboration with a large pharma partner,"" Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said.It wouldn't be the first time immuno-oncology drugs have been paired up in the hopes of becoming more efficient. Merck and Incyte (INCY) are looking at Keytruda and epacadostat in five tumor types.But this is a first in the PARP inhibitor landscape. PARP inhibitors, from the likes of Tesaro, AstraZeneca and Clovis, blocks specific enzymes to treat cancer. Immuno-oncology drugs teach an immune system to identify cancer. Analysts have long thought the PARP route would be limited to breast and ovarian cancers.Exploring Tesaro in these other indications could also offset disappointment that a recent study, dubbed Bravo, won't serve as a registrational trial for Zejula as a monotherapy in breast cancer patients with a BRCA mutation. Too many patients dropped out, Tesaro said in a news release.""Management noted that a large number of patients in the chemotherapy arm did not continue the trial long enough for their first scan, causing the company to determine that the results will be difficult to interpret,"" Leerink's Fernandez said.Instead, Tesaro will move forward in triple-negative breast cancer with an immuno-oncology drug. Triple negative breast cancer affects 15%-20% of all patient. Only 5%-10% of patients have the germ line BRCA mutation.Fernandez kept his market perform rating on Tesaro stock.RELATED:Tesaro Creeps Up On Rivals With Cancer Drug OK, But Merger UnlikelyTesaro Sell-Off On AstraZeneca Ovarian Cancer Trial Overdone: AnalystTesaro Rockets To All-Time High On Rumored Takeover Interest

That's certainly the case with Nvidia right now. Last week, the big-cap semiconductor and data networking technology play dropped more than 5% and closed near the low of that week's range. This week, Nvidia finished toward the lower end of its weekly trading range. If it had closed in the upper 60% of the weekly price range, that in fact may point to long-term institutional support.Some biotechs are thriving, and the group is now in the top 40 among IBD's 197 industries. Following Friday's action, the biotech industry group ranked 33rd in terms of six-month relative price performance.The next highest-ranking medical industry subgroup is systems and equipment, No. 41 out of 197 with a year-to-date gain exceeding 13%. The biotechs are up 8.4% since Jan. 1. Keep in mind, year-to-date performance does not always correspond with six-month relative price performance. Plus, the biotechs are a huge group with 423 stocks vs. 59 for the medical systems and equipment makers. Within the biotech group, Incyte (INCY) jumped 7.6% to 131.21, rising past a 4-weeks-tight follow-on entry point at 124.97. The oncology play is slated to join the S&P 500 early on Tuesday. Incyte scores a bullish 90 RS on a scale of 1 to 99.Elsewhere in the stock market today, IBD's screened new high list on Friday shows some smaller companies breaking out. Read this latest column by markets writer Nancy Gondo, who points out the earnings results and other news for names such as WageWorks (WAGE), Financial Engines (FNGN) and Universal Display (OLED).Meanwhile, next week is yet another important week for corporate results. Keep an eye out for Leaderboard name Broadcom (AVGO), whose results go out after the close Wednesday.Other key growth companies reporting include Workday (WDAY) (Monday; Q4 net loss of 1 penny a share expected, unchanged vs. a year ago), Domino's Pizza (DPZ) on Tuesday (Q4 profit of $1.44 expected, up 25%) and glaucoma treatment device play and IBD Leaderboard name Glaukos (GKOS) on Wednesday.RELATED:How To Trade Stocks: How Should You Handle Snapchat's Upcoming IPO?How To Trade Growth Stocks: Keys To Counting Bases In A Great PlayStock Market Today: Why Nvidia Shows Signs Of A Near-Term Top In Late DecemberThe Bottoming Base, Part I: Why It Helps Investors Make MoneyThe Bottoming Base, Part II: How Apple Formed One In 2009

98,INCY,"What if your body's immune system fought off deadly cancer cells just like it protects you from germs you encounter every day?That's the goal of an emerging class of treatments called immuno-oncology, or I-O, drugs, which Barclays analyst Geoff Meacham says could become a $25 billion market by 2025. Products from Merck (MRK), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Roche Holding (RHHBY) already are approved by the FDA to treat melanoma and lung cancer.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez estimates some 1,000 trials are underway in the I-O stratosphere. Those include drug trials by the likes of AstraZeneca (AZN), Incyte (INCY) and a slew of others to treat kidney, bladder, urothelial and head and neck cancers.Results are still very preliminary, says Tim Reilly, development lead for Bristol-Myers' early I-O pipeline.""That 'cure' is a tough word,"" he told IBD. ""We are seeing indications that we can at least reset the patient's immune system to normal homeostasis. ... Our hope is we can bring patients who have an official diagnosis of cancer back to that homeostatic place.""Bristol-Myers stock rose 0.6% to 54.58 in stock market trading Friday. Merck shares rose a small fraction, to 65.38, while Roche shares inched up 2 cents, to 30.53.  Incyte ended the day up 0.3%.Though preliminary, the I-O thesis played out for Bristol-Myers and Merck in Q4. Bristol-Myers tacked on $1.57 billion in sales of its I-O drugs Opdivo and Yervoy. Yervoy sales were flat, but Opdivo sales grew 176% from a  year earlier. Merck's Keytruda grew 125% to $483 million in sales. (See a list of the major immuno-oncology drugs cleared so far by the U.S. FDA and their approved uses.)Cancer cells are constantly occurring in everyone, Reilly says.""Every time we get out in the sunlight and get some UV exposure, there's a mutation to a cell that is technically now a mutated cell and is, technically, cancer,"" he said. ""But our body eradicates that cell.""That's what a healthy immune system does. But, in some cases, aberrant cells evolve to outpace or outsmart the system, throwing off the body's natural homeostasis. Those cells then grow, becoming a cancerous tumor.IBD'S TAKE: Wall Street was nervous entering the Q4 earnings season as biotechs took political heat for high drug prices. But biotech Incyte is riding high on a plethora of potential blockbusters, including those in the I-O sector. Head to IBD's The New America article to get a deep dive on Incyte's vast opportunities.Chemotherapy — pumping the body full of poison to kill cancer cells — is the standard of care. In the early 2000s, targeted therapies changed the growth rates of tumors. After that, drugmakers looked at combining therapies to improve results.Immuno-oncology drugs — more precisely checkpoint inhibitors — are completely different, Meacham says.Merck's Keytruda and Bristol-Myers' Opdivo are both PD-1 inhibitors. Both were first approved in 2014 to treat melanoma. Since then, they've tacked on a slew of indications including lung cancer and head and neck cancer. Yervoy is Bristol-Myers' CTLA-4 inhibitor. It was approved in 2011 for advanced melanoma.""A lot of these drugs basically train the immune system to see the difference between a regular cell and a tumor cell, and use the immune system to fight the tumor off,"" Meacham said.Immune system T cells patrol the body for aberrant cells. When a T cell encounters another cell, it probes the surface looking for proteins that would indicate a cancerous cell. Upon finding a cancer cell, the T cells attack, calling forth additional molecules to prevent the battle from injuring regular tissue.These additional molecules are checkpoint inhibitors, explained a July 6, 2016, blog post from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. But a cancerous cell can trick a T cell by wearing the proteins of a normal cell, evading detection and destruction.""Checkpoint inhibitors block these normal proteins on cancer cells, or the proteins on T cells that respond to them,"" Dana-Farber wrote. ""The result is to remove the blinders that prevented T cells from recognizing the cells as cancerous and leading an immune-system assault on them.""Monotherapies like Merck's Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo block the interaction between the PD-1 protein on a T cell surface and the PD-L1 protein on the surface of the cancer cell. Doing so allows the T cell to see the cancer cell for what it is.Bristol's CTLA-4 antibody Yervoy works in a similar fashion.More than 1,000 clinical trials are exploring different inhibitors, Leerink's Fernandez wrote in a Jan. 20 note. Firms are also looking at checkpoint modulators that would stimulate T cell activation.Merck's Keytruda and Bristol-Myers' Opdivo have myriad indications as solo therapies. Both are indicated in advanced lung cancer and head and neck cancer. Opdivo is also approved to treat melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and Hodgkin lymphoma. Bristol-Myers' Yervoy is indicated in melanoma.Near-term excitement, though, is on the potential for I-O combinations. That's where Merck might have a slight lead. In January, the Food and Drug Administration accepted Merck's supplemental filing for accelerated approval of a Keytruda plus chemo combination to treat non-small-cell lung cancer.Less than two weeks later, Bristol-Myers said it wouldn't seek accelerated approval for its combination of Opdivo and Yervoy in non-small-cell lung cancer, confirming Merck will have a lead in that market. Bristol-Myers is studying that combo in its Phase 3 trial CheckMate-227.In the aftermath, Wall Street is awaiting the results of AstraZeneca's Mystic trial with bated breath. Like Opdivo and Yervoy, AstraZeneca's durvalumab and tremelimumab are PD-1 and CTLA-4 antibodies, respectively, Barclays' Meacham says.""That trial is a leading indicator of what could happen with 227,"" he told IBD. ""It's a similar mechanism to Bristol-Myers' Yervoy and Opdivo. ... There are a lot of subtleties between the (Mystic) trial and the 227 study, but I think overall people want to see if the idea worked.""Meanwhile, Merck is testing out Keytruda with Incyte's epacadostat in first-line melanoma, advanced lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck cancer, and bladder cancer. Epacadostat belongs to another class of checkpoint inhibitors working to target IDO enzymes.CTLA-4 antibodies were among the first I-O antibodies approved. In 2011, when it was first approved, Yervoy ""was a pretty toxic drug,"" Meacham said. But drugmakers pushed forward upon the discovery of ""eye-popping"" efficacy when combining CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies.Finding the right dosages of both drugs requires ""a bit of trial and error,"" Bristol-Myers' Reilly said. Through that testing, Bristol-Myers has cut down on the toxicity of its Opdivo and Yervoy combo to ensure the benefits outweigh the risks.""We don't want to bring toxicity to patients,"" he said. ""But we know one thing for sure: The cancer will kill the patient. We want to be sure we're bringing the benefit and that the Opdivo plus Yervoy combination will bring that benefit.""Reilly expects future cancer treatment to focus on segments of patients who share a diagnosis and similar biomarkers. In the distant future, treatment combinations could potentially be tailored to specific patients based on their body's chemical makeup, said Merck's Dr. Roy Barnes.Barnes is the senior vice president of global clinical development for Merck Research Laboratories. Like Reilly, he won't call I-O a cure for cancer. But he notes impressive results from patients who've been on Yervoy, one of the first approvals, for years without progressing.""A lot of patients have started coming off of the drugs after three or four years,"" he said. ""When they come off, there have been very few relapses. It's early days, but it's quite encouraging.""RELATED:Merck Keytruda Sales Lag Without $40 Million In Deferred Revenue: AnalystBristol-Myers Topples On 2017 Guidance Cut Amid Merck I-O CompetitionCould Merck's 'Meaningful' Keytruda Royalty Give Bristol-Myers A Leg Up?

100,INCY,"Here's your Investing Action Plan for Tuesday: what you need to know as an investor for the coming day.As the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq set fresh record highs, investors will get a dose of economic reality, for better or worse, as Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen heads to Capitol Hill. Quarterly reports from more shale producers will continue to trickle in, this time from Diamondback Energy (FANG) and Devon Energy (DVN), while hot biotech Incyte (INCY) reports as well as construction materials provider Martin Marietta (MLM).The Fed chief gives her semiannual testimony on monetary policy at 10 a.m. ET before the Senate Banking Committee and follows it up Wednesday at 10 a.m. before the House Financial Services Committee. Investors will parse her words for clues on when the next rate hike will come. Recent data have been mixed, with the January jobs report showing a strong gain in payrolls but a slowdown in wage growth.Expect questions on how the agenda of the Trump administration and the GOP on spending and tax reforms could affect the Fed's stance. Trump's economic team has also talked about using alternative gauges of unemployment that incorporate people too discouraged to actively seek work, so watch for that too.The shale producer reports Q4 results after the market closes.Estimates: EPS to slip 7% to 54 cents while revenue surges 46% to $167.5 million.Stock: Shares fell 0.5% to 104.30 on the stock market today, but are still near a 113.33 buy point.Crude prices retreated Monday amid signs that U.S. production gains may offset the effects of OPEC's output cuts. The Permian Basin in particular has been the focus of U.S. activity and investment since oil prices started recovering last year. And as a Permian-focused company, any guidance from Diamondback on capital expenditures and output may indicate where other companies are headed.The oil exploration and production company reports Q4 results after the close.Estimates: EPS is seen plunging 73% to 21 cents, with revenue down 1.8% to $2.8 billion.Stock: Shares eased 0.3% to 45.26 but are within striking distance of a 50.79 entry.The biotech reports Q4 numbers before the opening bell.Estimates: EPS to sink 55% to 13 cents while revenue climbs 33% to $324.4 million.Stock: Shares slid 55 cents to 121.15 but broke out last month and are above buy range.RELATED:Incyte Gets $112 Million Boost On Novartis Jakavi Royalties: RBCIncyte Stock Breaks Out, It And Partner Merck Will Advance Key Trial The provider of construction aggregates reports Q4 results before the open.Estimates: EPS to jump 41% to $1.62 as revenue rises 15% to $896.65 million.Stock: Shares rose 0.5% to 231.39, as they try to retake a 236.51 buy point. Martin Marietta broke out in late January then fell below the buy zone days later amid doubts about an infrastructure spending package that was seen benefiting the company.Also, rival Vulcan Materials (VMC) recently missed estimates, citing an earlier-than-expected seasonal ramp-down of construction activity, and 2017 guidance was also softer than expected.

103,INCY,"The stock market gyrated throughout the day, maintaining modest gains in midday trading. After a weak open due to Brazil's stock market crash, the major indexes — the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average — all rallied higher.The tech-heavy Nasdaq, which bore the brunt of Wednesday's sharp sell-off, rose a solid 0.4%. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average had more modest gains, rising 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively. Volume was tracking sharply higher on the NYSE, but edged lower on the Nasdaq vs. the same time Wednesday. Among the Dow industrials, Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) paced the advancers with a 2.4% rise, while Apple (AAPL) followed up with a 1.2% gain. Wal-Mart reported strong Q1 profits early Thursday, but came up short on revenue estimates. The retail giant's shares remain in buy range from a 75.29 cup-base buy point.On the downside, Cisco Systems (CSCO) plunged nearly 8% after disappointing investors late Wednesday with its underwhelming current-quarter revenue guidance.Among the S&P 500, biotech Incyte (INCY) led the way with a 7% rise, while chip stocks Qorvo (QRVO) and Applied Materials (AMAT) ran up 3.3% and 2.2%, respectively. Applied Materials will report its Q2 earnings after the close today. Despite missing Q4 profit estimates, Alibaba (BABA) shares only dropped a little over 1% in midday trading after falling as much as 5.6% earlier in the day. Fellow Chinese stocks Sina (SINA), Weibo (WB) and NetEase (NTES) moved higher on the day, up 2.4%, 1.4% and 0.4%, respectively.A price-target hike sent Nvidia (NVDA) shares 2.3% higher in the stock market today, a welcome sign for investors after yesterday's 6.6% decline. The graphics-chip maker's price target was raised to 148 from 135 at UBS. Action within the IBD 50 was  mostly positive heading into late-day trading. On the upside, China-based Autohome (ATHM) jumped 3.6% to new highs, while recent IPO Floor & Decor (FND) moved 2.5% higher. Autohome is now 17% above a 36.11 cup-base entry, while Floor & Decor may finally be building a base after a successful April 27 IPO.On the downside, MercadoLibre (MELI) declined 4.7%. Volume surged, tracking almost 800% above average.

104,INCY,"Stocks staged a less-than-spirited advance on Thursday, but some large-cap techs were showing more fortitude.The Nasdaq composite was leading the major indexes, rising nearly 0.4% at 12:45 p.m. ET, but that's still well off morning highs and just a sliver of Wednesday's 2.6% walloping. The Nasdaq had gained as much as 0.8% early.The Nasdaq 100, getting support from the likes of Apple (AAPL) (still extended from a recent 3-weeks-tight entry point at 141.12) and Netflix (NFLX) (up nicely since a March breakout at 129.39, in a sturdy uptrend as well), is slightly outperforming with a gain of more than 0.5%.Both Apple and Netflix, which were recently on IBD Leaderboard, are true leaders in their respective industries and still show excellent prospects for further top and bottom line growth.Mild gains were sticking beyond lunchtime on Wall Street in the wake of news that the Justice Department has appointed former FBI chief Robert Mueller as special counsel to investigate potential dealings between White House staff and Russia. The Dow Jones industrial average was just above break-even a day after it slid more than 1.7% and pierced its 50-day moving average in heavy volume.Volume is up on the NYSE vs. the same time on Wednesday but slightly lower on the Nasdaq.The S&P 500 gained roughly 0.2%, boosted by strength in the biotech sector amid news coming from the well-followed ASCO conference. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Incyte (INCY), Sage Therapeutics (SAGE) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE) were among the top gainers in IBD's biotech industry group.Among these four, Regeneron holds the best IBD Composite Rating at 96, and for good reason. Revenue has grown more than 10-fold over the past five years, from $446 million in 2011 to $4.86 billion in 2016. It is a recognized leader in treatments that reflect excellent science, and has changed the face of treatment for age-related macular degeneration.Regeneron stopped losing money in 2012, earning $4.66 a share in 2012. Earnings have grown almost every year since then, up 40% to $11.34 a share.The stock has bounced nicely since hitting a 52-week low of 325.35 in August last year, and may now be working on a first-stage bottoming-base pattern.The Street sees Regeneron's earnings lifting 12% this year to $12.67 a share and another 21% to $15.32 in 2017. Other rising industry groups in the stock market today include diversified operations, medical software, fabless semiconductors, chipmaking and fiber-optic gear.Shire Group (SHPG), meanwhile, advanced nearly 3% to 187.46 in heavy trading, further adding distance above its 50- and 200-day moving averages on positive data for a treatment for hereditary angioedema. Shire, part of the ethical-drugs industry group, and Regeneron are still in the early stages of forming the right side of potential new bases. It's important to have patience and see if these and other names in the two beaten-down medical industry groups can flex enough price strength to get in a proper position to break out.The market's general price-and-volume action, as noted in Wednesday's Big Picture column, represented a notable change in character among institutional investors compared with prior declines by the Dow to and below the key intermediate-term support line. Therefore, IBD changed its current outlook from ""confirmed uptrend"" to ""uptrend under pressure,"" meaning that new buys are permissible, but must be done with extra caution.The Dow industrials' Accumulation/Distribution Rating is now at C+, down from B- yet still positive. IBD's Accumulation rating covers 13 weeks' worth of price-and-volume action. A grade of C+ or higher indicates that mutual funds, hedge funds, insurers, pensions, banks and the like are overall accumulating equities.As seen in the general market indicators page, which is a PDF link found at the bottom of the Big Picture column each day, at least 17 names within the 30-member Dow Jones industrial average still have an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B or higher, a good sign. You can see all 30 stocks' ratings at the top of the Dow Jones daily chart on the link.Small caps also rebounded, yet rather meekly compared with Wednesday's carnage. The S&P SmallCap 600 rallied 0.1% after sinking 2.4%. It too fell sharply below its 50-day moving average; at Wednesday's low, the 600 was 5.5% below its all-time high of 866.In other financial markets, WTI crude oil continued to rebound amid a fading U.S. dollar, rising nearly 0.8% to $49.44 and hitting one-month highs. Gold futures on the Comex cooled nearly 0.4% to $1,254 a troy ounce, but have bounced more than 3% since hitting as low as $1,216 on May 9.The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond continued to sink, edging down 2.21%. Yet according to the latest analysis of fed funds rate futures at CME Group, the probability of a new 25-basis point hike in short-term interest rates at the Federal Reserve's June 14 meeting is still more than 69%.RELATED:What's The Market Direction?

106,INCY,"How do you get a handle on the biotech market when an unknown stock like Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) — up nearly 200% since January — outperforms the likes of the industry's top name, Amgen (AMGN)?Sure, Esperion has had some breakthroughs in cholesterol medication. But Amgen recently had its own moment with one of its cholesterol drugs, proving that decreasing ""bad"" LDL cholesterol also cuts the risk of heart attack and stroke. Still, Amgen isn't getting the respect that smaller biotech players are getting, up a comparatively paltry 11% this year.Don't get discouraged, though, analysts say. Just because Amgen isn't getting a lot of love, it doesn't mean other biotech stocks are slouches. It's really a question of navigating what can be a complex sector.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says biotechs have done well since the election, though the stocks are subject to the whims of political debate over drug pricing and health care.""We're worried about Donald Trump and health care reform ... we're worried about FDA reform and now we're worried about drug-pricing regulations,"" he said. ""And it just doesn't seem as though the accumulated worries are going to go away in a hurry.""The overall group, though, looks strong. It's now ranked No. 10 out of 197 groups tracked, and four weeks ago it was ranked No. 5.IBD'S TAKE: Among drugmakers, Allergan is sweeping the medical-aesthetics market. But Hologic wants to play. Head to the Industry Snapshot for a breakdown on that battle.Porges and Mizuho analyst Salim Syed call it a ""stock-pickers market."" Some biotechs are bound to do well in 2017 with a number of catalysts still ahead of them, while others are more likely to struggle with macroeconomics and politics.""There are still some pressures that investors need to be cognitive of, like drug pricing,"" Syed told IBD. ""Some folks thought that was a presidential platform topic, but it keeps coming up now in the postelection.""IBD's 425-company Biomed/Biotech industry group is up 12% for the year. Major exchange traded funds iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (IBB) and the SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) are up 12% and 20%, respectively.The top five biotechs include Amgen, Gilead Sciences (GILD), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN). Each has been in the news in 2017, but none on stock price. Amgen has gained the most at 11% with Gilead lagging, down 6% since January.Syed has buy ratings on Amgen, Celgene and Gilead stocks and a neutral rating on Biogen stock.But the smaller players and potential takeout candidates like Incyte (INCY) and Tesaro (TSRO) have seen big gains on Wall Street. Tesaro is likely to remain a stand-alone company, though, after grabbing FDA approval for ovarian cancer drug, Zejula. Its stock rose as much as 43% through mid-February but is now up only 3% for the year.Incyte, on the other hand, has tacked on 24% since January on rumors that No. 2 biotech Gilead could be looking to acquire it. Incyte would open Gilead up to the oncology world as its hepatitis C franchise struggles amid high cure rates.""Once again, we're starting the year with the best-performing stocks being those that were cheapest and more of takeout candidates,"" Porges told IBD. ""So (making predictions has) definitely been somewhat challenging.""Earlier this month, Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) stock hit an 11-year high on strong data for a pain pill that could be an alternative to potentially addictive Oxycodone. Nektar stock catapulted 43% in a single day. Shares extended 25% from a cup-with-handle formation in late March, but have since given back 20% of those gains. The stock remains up 58% for the year.Other big stock earners include Kite Pharma (KITE) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE), both of which are working on drugs that belong to a class called CAR T-cell therapies. These drugs engineer patients' immune cells to treat cancer. Kite stock is up a whopping 80%, leading a 42% rise in Bluebird stock.And as Esperion rocketed on Amgen's heart study, so too did The Medicines Company (MDCO). Shares are up 45% since January. Porges lists Medicines Co. as a stock to watch, noting its ""spectacular returns.""""If you have the right stock and the right set of events, then you can still generate incredibly attractive returns and that's the excitement of biotech,"" Porges said. ""These are companies that are approaching critical readouts of ongoing development programs where investors think there's a reasonable chance a critical trial or a critical milestone turns out positively.""Mizuho's Syed suggests looking at individual stocks and equities, rather than hoping for a broad biotech resurgence. He sees a ""good number of catalysts"" in 2017 for the market, but notes the drug-pricing debate is likely to still weigh on the market.President Trump has keyed in on the drug-pricing debate and, though limited on details, says he has plans for a competitive-based system that would bring down the prices of drugs. Trump's pick to run the FDA, Scott Gottlieb, has said drug-pricing needs to be more transparent.As that struggle unfolds, Porges laid out some rules for picking biotech stocks likely to have better returns.""You want to be in growth companies early in their life cycle treating very serious illnesses,"" he said. ""And if you follow those three rules, you are generally going to end up with a portfolio that's going to perform better than the average, better than the index, better than the benchmarks.""Under those rules, Porges says Epizyme (EPZM), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) are interesting. Epizyme stock is up 44% since January, having topped a 12.70 buy point out of a cup-with-handle formation in early February. Vertex stock has gained 23% this year.Alexion stock is actually down 3% year to date, but the stock fits the bill using Porges' rules. The rare-disease company is working on drugs to treat disorders of the central nervous system, blood diseases and genetic disorders.The worst thing to do in biotech investing is to sell just because a stock is up, Porges said. And don't hesitate to buy a stock for the same reason.""One of the axioms of investing in biotech is always you never want to say, 'I'm not going to buy the stock because it's up,' because this is an industry where you can routinely see five-to-tenfold increases in value over the cycle of the emergence of a product,"" he said.""So often we see a stock where investors say, 'It's up 50%, but it's only gone from a $500 million market cap to a $750 million market cap,' which in the scheme of things is pretty small,"" he said. ""If you have a real drug, you're going to be a $5 billion or $6 billion company.""RELATED:Esperion And Medicines Co.

107,INCY,"Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Roche (RHHBY) and Merck (MRK) tend to grab immuno-oncology headlines, but the American Association of Cancer Research annual meeting highlighted a slew of potential competitors waiting in the wings.Earlier this year, an analyst estimated that there are more than 1,000 clinical drug trials which are examining different targets in immuno-oncology, a branch of cancer treatment that aims to teach the immune system to identify cancer cells.The AACR Annual Congress in Washington, D.C., proved that point, Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt said Wednesday in a note to clients. FDA-approved immuno-oncology drugs target specific proteins or enzymes, but many effective checkpoints are still being developed.""As in prior years, AACR remains a conference focused on earlier-stage cancer programs in development,"" he wrote. ""Emerging (immuno-oncology) targets feature prominently in preclinical and early clinical work.""Outside the usual names — Bristol, Roche, Incyte (INCY), Merck and AstraZeneca (AZN) — companies like NewLink Genetics (NLNK), Corvus Pharmaceuticals (CRVS), Five Prime Therapeutics (FPRX), Calithera Biosciences (CALA) and Oncomed Pharmaceuticals (OMED) are jumping on the trend.IBD'S TAKE: Want the breakdown on the immuno-oncology sector, including its competitors and worth? Head to IBD's Technology page.Immuno-oncology drugs are also called checkpoint inhibitors. Immune system cells ""check"" on passing cells. If the right proteins or enzymes match up, those cells can pass unmolested. That's why cancer cells camouflage themselves in specific proteins and enzymes to hide, experts say. Blocking that interaction allows the immune system to see the cancer cells.NewLink, like Incyte, Bristol and Roche, is aiming to target the IDO enzyme to prevent tumor cells from hoodwinking the immune system. NewLink is researching two IDO pathway inhibitors.Merck's Keytruda and NewLink's drug indoximod showed an overall response rate of 59% in 60 melanoma patients in a Phase 1 trial. All detectable tumors disappeared in 12% of patients vs. a 26% response in a combination of Keytruda and Incyte's epacadostat.Corvus, though, disappointed when its drug, known as CPI-444, showed a low response rate in just three of 96 patients who received either the single drug or CPI-444 in combination with Roche's Tecentriq. CPI-444 is what's known as an A2a receptor antagonist. Others in that vein have been discontinued on poor efficacy in the past.Five Prime and Calithera are looking at combining their drugs with other drugs. Calithera is aiming for a combination of its drug, which works to inhibit the glutaminase enzyme, with Bristol's Opdivo, which works to inhibit the PD-1 protein.Oncomed's data supports the mechanism for yet another checkpoint inhibitor, using an immune receptor called TIGIT. A Phase 1 trial is now open, Leerink's Schmidt says, following a talk with management.Oncomed, Five Prime and Incyte also had preclinical posters with second-generation drugs.""Several next-generation immune-agonists aim to overcome hurdles encountered by first-generation agents,"" Schmidt wrote. ""These second-generation agonists, which are now in Phase 1, ... generated significant interest among conference attendees.""RELATED:Bristol Keeps Up With Merck In Cancer, But Incyte Is True Winner: AnalystBristol 'Can't Afford To Lose' To Dow Stock Merck In Immuno-OncologyWill Bristol Prove This Longtime Theory In Cancer Defense?

108,INCY,"Eli Lilly (LLY) is set to outperform bigger drugmakers Novartis (NVS) and Sanofi (SNY) in terms of first-quarter diabetes sales, helping tug Lilly up after its rheumatoid arthritis drug was delayed at the FDA, one analyst said Tuesday.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez kept his outperform ratings on Lilly and Sanofi stocks and market perform rating on Novartis ahead of their first-quarter earnings in a note to clients. Lilly and Novartis are set to report earnings April 25, with Sanofi coming on April 28.""We believe Lilly is poised to deliver a strong top-line and bottom-line performance,"" Fernandez said. ""The pullback of the stock following the FDA's complete response letter for baricitinib creates an attractive trading opportunity, in our view.""On Monday, Lilly stock lost 4.1% after the FDA said the application for Lilly's rheumatoid arthritis drug, baricitinib, is incomplete without further clinical dosing information. The request likely hampers baricitinib, produced in partnership with Incyte (INCY), by at least a year.Though other analysts have said baricitinib is likely delayed by a year, Fernandez sees the Lilly/Incyte drug delayed by 18 to 24 months to late 2018 or 2019. He cut his annual global sales forecast for the drug by $200 million.But sales of diabetes drug Trulicity and psoriasis drug Talz will more than offset the delay for baricitinib, Fernandez said. He raised his peak sales for Trulicity and Talz to $4.5 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively.Overall, the consensus of analysts polled by Yahoo (YHOO) expects Lilly to report $5.2 billion in sales, up 7.1% vs. the year-earlier period, and adjusted earnings of 96 cents a share, up 15.7%. Fernandez is more bullish, at $5.3 billion and 98 cents. He boosted his price target on Lilly shares to 93 from 91.Fernandez expects Sanofi and Novartis to deliver in-line revenue as each firm's basal insulin diabetes franchise faces pricing pressure. These drugs include Lantus and Toujeo for Sanofi and Levemir and Tresiba for Novartis.IBD'S TAKE: Eli Lilly has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 53 based on key growth metrics like earnings and sales performance. Better stock bets include the likes of Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ), which has a CR of 86 out of a best-possible 99. Head to the Stock Checkup to see how your picks stack up.Lantus and Toujeo prescriptions are performing better than expected in the face of the launch of Basaglar from Lilly, Fernandez said in a note to clients. Still, he sees a 15% year-over-year pricing decline for Lantus.The silver lining for Sanofi is Dupixent, an eczema-treating injection in conjunction with partner Regeneron (REGN). The drug was approved in March so it won't have sales in the first quarter. The consensus sees Sanofi's sales dipping 5.5% in the first quarter to $8.88 billion.For Novartis, Fernandez notes Victoza is still growing and Tresiba ""uptake is on track,"" but pricing pressure is likely to weigh on both diabetes drugs through at least the end of the third quarter.Broadly, analysts expect Novartis to report 0.7% sales growth to $11.68 billion and adjusted earnings of $1.13 a share, down 3 cents vs. the year-earlier period.Sanofi fell 2.4% to close at 44.45 on the stock market today. Lilly dropped 1.4% to 81.20. Novartis dipped 0.5% to 72.93. That followed Johnson & Johnson's lackluster first-quarter results, which saw drug sales eke out a 0.8% gain.RELATED:Can Lilly Survive Rheumatoid Arthritis Flop With Breast Cancer Drug?Dow's Johnson & Johnson Sets Up Lackluster Results For Sector

109,INCY,"XThe Nasdaq composite showed resilience and the stock market shrugged off increased tensions with North Korea over the weekend, along with two economic reports that missed expectations, to move higher through midday trade.Meanwhile, the New York Federal Reserve's Empire State manufacturing index fell to 5.2 in April from March's 16.4, below estimates for a 15.0 reading. Meanwhile, the NAHB's Housing Market index came in at 68 in April vs. the 70 estimate.The Nasdaq led the way with a 0.6% gain and attempted to recapture the 50-day line, which it lost on Thursday. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average moved 0.5% higher. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average gave up their own 50-day support levels last Wednesday. Volume is running lower vs. the same time on Thursday ahead of the three-day Easter holiday. Among the Dow industrials, stocks were all positive with no components trading in the red, while Boeing (BA) paced the advancers in the stock market today. Shares took off 1.6% as the airplane maker looked to rebound from its 10-week line near 177.64.The megacap industrial and defense play has rallied more than 30% since clearing a 139.55 buy point in a long saucer base in late October. It gets a respectable 87 Composite Rating, a 93 EPS Rating on a scale of 1 to 99, and an 88 RS Rating from IBD Stock Checkup.Drug stocks traded lower in midday trading driven by an FDA decision. Shares of Eli Lilly (LLY) and Incyte (INCY) were sent lower after the Food and Drug Administration failed to approve their rheumatoid arthritis drug baricitinib. Eli Lilly dropped 3.5%, while Incyte plunged 10.3% as both pierced their 50-day lines. Meanwhile, Abiomed (ABMD) dropped 3.9% as the cardiac pump maker builds the right side of a potential base. Chip stocks moved higher as the industry looked to recover from last week's weakness driven by Apple's decision to in-source certain types of chips. Leading fabless semiconductor group name Broadcom (AVGO) moved up 1.2% as shares attempted to get back above the 50-day line. Meanwhile, IBD 50 member Nvidia (NVDA) jumped 2.8%.

On the downside, China-based Momo (MOMO) declined 0.4%.After the close, Netflix (NFLX) will release its much-anticipated Q1 earnings report. On Jan. 19, the video streaming company surged nearly 4% after exceeding its Q4 earnings and sales forecast. However, the stock hasn't made much progress to the upside since then, but remains holding above its 50-day. Consensus estimates expect the company to earn 37 cents per share on revenues totaling $2.64 billion.RELATED:Two More 'Soft Economic Reports Just Turned Less BullishEli Lilly, Incyte Stocks Break Key Levels After FDA Drug SetbackNetflix Earnings On Tap As Streaming Media Stock Undercuts Support

110,INCY,"Early gains faded, sending the major indexes to the lowest levels of the session in afternoon trading Thursday.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average were down 0.4%. Dow component JPMorgan (JPM) reversed lower, shedding 1%, after the bank reported first-quarter results that topped expectations.Two other big banks that announced earnings all fell. Citigroup (C) also reversed lower and Wells Fargo (WFC) fell to its 200-day moving average, the first time it has been there since Nov. 9. Financials have been flagging since March, shadowing a decline in the 10-year Treasury yield, and today's earnings didn't do much to restore confidence in the sector.The Nasdaq was 0.2% lower, getting some help from gains in fiber optic, business software and biotech industry groups. In biotechs, one chart to study is Incyte (INCY), which is rising from support at the 50-day moving average.Netflix (NFLX), one of the Nasdaq's top components, inched higher but more importantly it held support at the 50-day moving average. The video-streaming company could benefit from a possible strike by Hollywood writers, a Barclays analyst says.  Also, Guggenheim raised its price target on Netflix to 173 from 160 and kept a buy rating ahead of Monday's earnings report after the close.Volume was tracking lower, not surprising on the last day ahead of a three-day weekend for Wall Street. Stock exchanges are closed Friday for the Good Friday holiday.Steel and energy stocks led the market lower. Retail and banks also were laggards as earnings from three major banks this morning were mixed.Steel producers and alloys makers were at the bottom of the 197 IBD industry groups in today's market. U.S. Steel (X) fell 4% and is below the 30 price level for the first time since Nov. 22, when it was breaking out of a base. The stock has been trending lower for about eight weeks and selling intensified this week as doubts grew about the so-called Trump Trade — a potential boom in infrastructure spending.Glaukos (GKOS) tumbled below the 50-day moving average in heavy volume, a sell signal for the maker of a glaucoma treatment. The company announced late Wednesday it had acquired sensor-system assets and related liabilities from DOSE Medical Corp. for $5.5 million in cash, plus performance-based payments of up to $9.5 million. DOSE is a former subsidiary of Glaukos that was spun off.RELATED:Hollywood Writers Strike Threat: Netflix, Facebook, Amazon Seen As WinnersFacebook, Netflix Get Price-Target Hikes; SkyWest A Strong Buy

111,INCY,"Incyte (INCY) stock hit a record high Monday on rumors No. 3 biotech Gilead Sciences (GILD) could be looking to acquire it amid projections of still dwindling hepatitis C drug sales in 2017.Incyte stock ended the regular trading session up 1.2%, at 151.03 on Monday, after earlier touching an all-time high at 151.63. Gilead stock, on the other hand, trended down for the third consecutive day, closing down a fraction, at 68.10.Rumors emerged Friday that Gilead could be putting together a bid on Incyte with eyes on its immuno-oncology drug, epacadostat. Epacadostat is currently in trials with Merck's (MRK) Keytruda to target five tumor types.Though Merck competes directly with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Incyte's drug is a different flavor of immuno-oncology, working to inhibit what is known as the IDO enzyme. Doing so, allows the immune system to identify tumor cells for what they are, and destroy them.Credit Suisse analyst Kennen MacKay boosted his price target on Incyte stock to 174 from 136 in a note titled, in part, ""Scarcity Value Makes for Compelling Target."" Incyte and epacadostat could offer Gilead an attractive entry point into the immuno-oncology field, MacKay said.IBD'S TAKE: An analyst urged Gilead to buy something on Friday. Which companies would be a good fit? Visit IBD Industry Themes for a breakdown of Gilead's potential targets.""Epacadostat could be a scarce immuno-oncology backbone blockbuster,"" he wrote in a note. Incyte's drug could be paired with drugs like Merck's Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo, both of which target a protein called, PD-1, to battle cancer.For Gilead, Incyte would offer the biotech giant entry into a potentially massive market as its hepatitis C franchise falls from a two-year run. Gilead's Sovaldi and Harvoni brought in north of $40 billion in sales before toppling in 2016.Hepatitis C is curable, Gilead has explained. So the company is seeing fewer patients and those who do suffer from hepatitis C are healthier. Healthier patients tend to wait longer before seeing a doctor.Gilead has pushed its HIV drug, bictegravir, as its next ""Mount Everest,"" but analysts have pushed for Gilead to make an acquisition. On Friday, an analyst suggested Gilead look at companies with pipelines resembling those of Incyte, Clovis Oncology and Tesaro.After reports emerged Gilead could be considering a bid on Incyte, Gilead declined to comment in an email to IBD. Incyte didn't return a request for comment.RELATED:How Gilead Is Paying The Price For Actually Curing A DiseaseWill Merck, Glaxo Undercut Gilead's Next 'Mount Everest' Drug?Gilead Hepatitis C Sales Plunge As Merck Swipes Share: Analyst

112,INCY,"The largest biotech ETFs served up a reminder in March that investors in this high-growth industry should expect a bumpy ride. They hit their best levels in a year early on, then took a nasty tumble before bouncing back smartly from those losses.On Tuesday, SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) and iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) were modestly lower but holding above the 10-week moving average — a bullish sign after a recent test of that critical marker of support. And despite a stumble in March so far, they are holding on to double-digit gains for the first quarter, vs. 12% for the S&P 500.That's a nice turnaround from a plunge of more than 10% for many biotech exchange traded funds the prior quarter, which coincided with hawkish election rhetoric about price-gouging in the drug industry.The latest rally comes despite major setbacks this month, including Trump tweets on drug prices and serious blows to big-name biotechs Amgen (AMGN) and Biogen (BIIB), which cast a pall on the entire industry.Biotechnology ETFs rallied sharply in January and February as higher beta names swung into favor after President Trump's shock election win. Plus, investors saw these stocks as a ""value play in a growth industry,"" said Matthew Bartolini, head of research for SPDR Americas.Some market analysts still see fair-to-attractive valuations in the sector, despite its year-to-date outperformance, helping IBB earn an upgrade recently.In light of improving valuations, however, two things will be key to the next leg up for this industry, in Bartolini's view.First, biotechs have to deliver on their promise of growth.Many smaller firms like Kite Pharma (KITE) and Esperion (ESPR) are unprofitable or have no sales, and even industry bellwethers such as Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Incyte (INCY) are in earnings slumps.However, earnings momentum for the sector as a whole is starting to look more favorable, some analysts say. Top biotech Celgene (CELG), which earns an extremely high EPS Rating of 98 from IBD, has scored upward revisions in forward estimates.Secondly, mergers and acquisitions must come to fruition to boost share prices. Intercept (ICPT), Regeneron (REGN) and Biogen are three names being bandied about as takeover targets.XBI has outpaced peers in 2017 so far, as it has consistently over the past three-, five- and 10 years. It is up 17.9% year to date through March 27 vs. a 10.6% gain for its iShares rival, which is cap-weighted and skews toward larger companies.Bartolini considers the SPDR biotech to be well placed looking ahead as well. An equal-weighted indexing method gives it a small-cap tilt. That may be beneficial in an industry such as biotechnology, where smaller and more speculative companies have strong potential as long-term growth plays, he said.Plus, relative to cap-weighted rivals, XBI is less tied to the fortunes of the largest names in the industry. On the one hand, that makes the SPDR ETF more immune to single-stock risk and ""tweet risk,"" in Bartolini's words. However, it also will benefit less from a big price gain for the industry giants.A Trump tweet on drug pricing hit XBI and IBB hard on March 7.RELATED:Which ETFs Are Making Big Moves?

113,INCY,"Cancer biotech Incyte (INCY) topped Wall Street's Q4 sales expectations early Tuesday, despite a steep slide in profit amid rising costs and Jakafi sales that narrowly missed analyst expectations.In the stock market today, Incyte rebounded from premarket losses and rose 1.8% to 123.32, earlier touching a 16-month high of 125.49.For Q4, Incyte reported revenue of $326.5 million, up 34% from the year-earlier period, and earnings per share minus items of 5 cents, down 83%. Analyst consensus had called for $324.4 million and 13 cents.Sales of Jakafi, the company's main product, which is used to treat myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera, a bone marrow disorder, rose 30% in Q4 to $237.5 million. RBC Capital analyst Simos Simeonidis says the consensus called for $238.3 million in Q4 Jakafi sales.Novartis (NVS) paid Incyte $33 million and $111 million in Q4 and 2016, respectively, to market the drug outside the U.S., as Jakavi.Iclusig, which wasn't being sold a year ago, brought in $12.87 million. Incyte sells Iclusig outside the U.S. in a deal with Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIA). Japan's Takeda Pharmaceuticals last month announced an agreement to acquire Ariad for $5.2 billion.Incyte wrapped up 2016 with $1.1 billion in sales, up 47%, and EPS of 54 cents, up from 3 cents in 2015.For 2017, Incyte guided to $1.02 billion to $1.07 billion in Jakafi sales and $60 million to $65 million in Iclusig sales, which would be up 23% and 119% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Jakafi sales grew 42% in 2016.Incyte didn't provide Q1 or 2017 earnings or overall revenue guidance. Analysts have modeled $1.54 billion in 2017 sales, up 40%, and EPS ex items of $1.31.IBD'S TAKE: Incyte was expected to top Q4 expectations on a number of potential blockbusters. Head to The New America for a broad take on Incyte and why its stock might be work a look.Editor's note: This article has been updated to correct the headline and clarify in the text that the company's sales guidance was for its Jakafi product only and that Incyte did not issue disappointing guidance for its overall revenue.  RELATED:I-O Players Incyte, Roche Squeeze Array's Melanoma Market: LeerinkWill Merck Let Incyte Go After AstraZeneca, Bristol, Roche Team-ups Too?Incyte Gets $112 Million Boost On Novartis Jakavi Royalties: RBC

114,INCY,"When biotechnology giant Gilead Sciences (GILD) bought Pharmasset in 2011, it inherited a compound then known as 7977, which Wall Street analysts expected to bring in $3.6 billion in peak sales by 2018.But just three years later, 7977 launched under the name Sovaldi at north of $1,000 a pill. It raked in $10.3 billion in 2014 sales alone and proved to be a nearly foolproof cure for hepatitis C virus, or HCV. Over three years, Gilead's flagship HCV drugs pulled in more than $44 billion. They also doubled the company's net margins, pushing them past the 50% level at one point in mid-2014.Trouble is, Gilead didn't just treat hepatitis C. For the most part, it cured patients after about three months. Sovaldi had an unheard-of success rate of up to 95% in some hepatitis C patients, and its follow-on treatment, Harvoni, proved more effective in some cases. Eventually, the patient pool was bound to get smaller, and it has. Sovaldi and Harvoni sales fell a respective 24% and 34% in 2016.""Think of it like an opening of a blockbuster movie in Hollywood and people wait in line,"" RBC analyst Michael Yee told Investor's Business Daily. ""Thus, there are less coming in right now than before.""Now the pressure is on Gilead to produce another big hit to drive its growth. And for biotech investors, its story is a cautionary tale to look beyond the initial fanfare of a hot new drug and consider the costs should it deliver on its promise.Hepatitis — unlike HIV, Alzheimer's disease and many types of cancer — can be a short-term temporary condition, said Kevin Young, Gilead's chief operating officer, on the company's Feb. 7 earnings conference call with analysts. Gilead says fewer patients are starting on HCV regimens and those that do are healthier than past patients.""And thanks to Harvoni, (HCV) can be cured in as little as eight weeks in a genotype 1 patient,"" Young said, referring to the most common type of hepatitis C.Gilead confirmed worries of the hepatitis C slowdown on Feb. 7 after releasing its fourth-quarter earnings. Shares toppled 8.6% the next day, nearly touching a three-year low. Whispers of the looming dip in HCV drug sales had plagued Gilead stock for the better part of a year.After climbing rapidly in 2013 and 2014, Gilead stock started to slip in 2015 and lost 31% in 2016 as analysts issued report after report modeling what Gilead would look like without HCV. Today, Gilead sees its HIV unit, which grew 13% last year, as its next big enterprise and has described its HIV drug bictegravir as its future ""Mount Everest.""Still, sentiment hasn't been this negative on Gilead stock since its $11 billion Pharmasset acquisition in 2011, says Evercore analyst Mark Schoenebaum. Then, 82% of analysts surveyed by Schoenebaum said Gilead paid too much for Pharmasset. Later on, analysts missed the potential and immediate demand for Sovaldi, and didn't even account for Harvoni.""Last time sentiment on Gilead's management was this bad, investors were wrong, very wrong,"" Schoenebaum wrote in a Feb. 16 research report. More than half, 51%, in the November 2011 survey said the Pharmasset buy would destroy Gilead's value.Sentiment obviously improved. Before Sovaldi, old-school hepatitis C treatments weren't as effective and often came along with flu-like side effects and anemia. Sovaldi was so successful that Gilead launched Harvoni in 2015 and saw similar results: $13.86 billion in Harvoni sales that year. Its newest addition to the hepatitis C line, Epclusa, brought in $1.75 billion in 2016.Gilead stock flew 106% in 2013 as Wall Street performed a 180-degree turn on Sovaldi ahead of its launch. Though activist groups and patients were incensed as inside discussions bumped Sovaldi's price to $84,000 from expectations for $36,000, the drug was a Wall Street dynamo.Harvoni launched with an even bigger $94,500 price tag. Gilead took its lumps in headlines for the price of both, but RBC analyst Yee says the price tags weren't particularly egregious, considering prior treatments and costs.""The high cost of treatment was not high relative to the existing prior therapy and was significantly better,"" he told IBD in an email. ""The costs have all come down by 50% given competition and other rebating.""For the fourth quarter, Gilead Chief Executive John Milligan noted Harvoni now sells for $15,000 in the U.S. Meanwhile, rivalries with Merck (MRK) and AbbVie will help curb prices. Merck itself signaled its expectations for lighter HCV sales in February when it took a $2.9 billion impairment charge on uprifosbuvir.Merck acquired uprifosbuvir from Idenix Pharmaceuticals in 2014. The company cut its value estimate on uprifosbuvir to $240 million. Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says Merck is signaling ""reduced value for its participation in the market, which is consistent with a declining market overall.""Merck has successfully defended its patents for HCV med Zepatier against Gilead, and AbbVie is working on a next-generation drug set to launch sometime in 2017-18.Wall Street suspected the HCV decline was coming, and modeled $28 billion in total Gilead sales with $11.5 billion in hepatitis C franchise revenue for Gilead in 2017.The company's guidance for $22.5 billion to $24.5 billion in total sales and $7.5 billion to $9 billion from hepatitis C drug revenue painted a starker picture.Along with that guidance, Gilead said it expects patient starts on HCV regimens to drop in 2017. In 2016, Gilead estimates 231,000 patients started on its hepatitis C drugs, about 25,000 fewer than in 2015. In 2016, HCV sales got a push after two large commercial payers opened access and amid a marketing campaign via the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.Gilead's Young doesn't expect those ""one-time"" drivers to repeat in 2017.""The guidance implies a 20%-30% lower EPS (earnings per share) than consensus was modeling,"" RBC's Yee wrote in a Feb. 8 research report. ""We think the stock is probably range-bound until they can hit at least one to two quarters, and demonstrate a handle on forecasts/visibility.""Yee also echoed other analysts' calls for acquisitions to bolster the top line while Gilead works through the HCV decline and works to launch drugs in its HIV and NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) units. Yee sees Incyte (INCY) as a smart, but unlikely, deal.Gilead withstood pressure before and after its Pharmasset buy and won't bend to public pressure for M&A, Evercore's Schoenebaum said in a Feb. 16 video. Investors are questioning CEO Milligan, but none have identified the specific deal he missed that would have prevented the HCV decline.IBD'S TAKE: For a strong drugmaking bet, check out Incyte, analysts say. Incyte's pipeline is brimming with potential blockbuster opportunities. Head to The New America for a deeper dive on Incyte and its upcoming catalysts.""What you have here is a company that's not just going to go do a deal so they can out a press release saying, 'We did a deal,' and hope they get a sugar high on the stock on it,"" he said. ""They're only going to do deals they have a high degree of confidence will work out and a high degree of confidence they're underpaying for the asset.""Meanwhile, Gilead is bolstering its HIV and NASH units. Gilead recently pitted HIV drug bictegravir against GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) incumbent dolutegravir, approved in 2013 and sold under the brand name Tivicay. The phase 2 trial showed bictegravir is numerically stronger than GSK's drug in certain combinations.Price is a bigger concern. GSK's medication is cheaper since it combines with a generic med, meaning the HIV regimen can be priced around $17,000 vs. the likely $30,000 price tag attached to Gilead's solution, Yee said in a Feb. 15 report.Other analysts say Gilead's HIV and NASH units are ""too late"" and offer ""little value."" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said on Feb. 8 that he expects hepatitis C sales to topple 45% in 2017 and then 12%-21% annually through 2020. Though his outlook on HIV is positive, those sales aren't on an HCV-like trajectory, Porges said.""This is not sufficient to offset the unusual dynamics of the HCV business and the relatively modest contributions from other products offer little to mitigate the boom and bust in HCV,"" he wrote. ""Those opportunities appear to be arriving too late, with too little value, in our view.""Yee, though, says Gilead isn't filling a hole left from its declining HCV unit. It's merely coming down off a ""massive bolus of hundreds of thousands of people who came in during the first two years.""""The drug is still set to do $8 billion in 2017 and is one of the largest drugs in the world. Not exactly a hole,"" he said.RELATED:Gilead Clobbered On Hep C; 'Little Value' In 'Too Late' NASH, HIV UnitsCan Gilead Swivel To HIV Amid Flounder Hep C Sales, GSK Rivalry?Gilead HIV Drug Tops GSK Combo But Rivalry 'Intense' With GSK Doublet

115,INCY,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) ought to pursue a merger outside its core virology, oncology, inflammation areas, an analyst said Friday — and the plea may have worked sooner than he thought.Barclays analyst Geoffrey Meacham suggested that Gilead look at companies with pipelines resembling those of Incyte (INCY), Tesaro (TSRO) and Clovis Oncology (CLVS). Then hours later, Incyte stock spiked more than 8%, to 149.24, on a StreetInsider report citing inside sources who say Gilead is ready to pull the trigger on acquiring the $26.6 billion biotech. Gilead stock, though, sank a fraction, near 68, on the stock market today.Representatives from Gilead had no comment. Incyte didn't immediately return requests for comment.Meacham's suggestion from came as total prescriptions of hepatitis C drug Harvoni dipped 2.2% week over week to 3,427, according to health care tracker IMS and cited by Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez. New prescriptions also fell 2% vs. last week.At the same time, Gilead's Epclusa saw total prescriptions flatten, though new prescriptions rose 6.1% on a week-over-week basis.Still, competition is mounting. Merck's (MRK) rival drug Zepatier posted a stout 5.8% jump in total prescriptions, though new scripts fell 10.3%.Gilead's struggles with its hepatitis C franchise are well documented. After two years and more than $40 billion in total sales, Gilead's Harvoni and Sovaldi saw sales decline in 2016, partially offset by new drug Epclusa. That's because hepatitis C is curable.Now, Gilead is pushing its HIV unit as its next ""Mount Everest."" Barclays' Meacham, though, is doubtful the company's HIV drug bictegravir will be enough to tug up Gilead stock by itself. Shares have toppled 4.5% since January. Shares lost 0.3% to 68.19 on Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Analysts had long predicted Gilead's hepatitis C downfall before it happened. But what were the warning signs? Head to IBD's Industry Themes for the breakdown.In a letter to Gilead management, Meacham implored the company to seek a ""transformational or even incremental transaction."" He suggested Gilead look at companies with immuno-oncology drugs that target the IDO checkpoint, those with assets in the PARP inhibitor class of drugs or firms working in lymphoma.""A deal that is much more pipeline-driven with a longer-term (profit and loss) benefit also likely would be well received but also carry substantial clinical risk,"" Meacham wrote in a note. The trade-off could be favorable if Gilead acquires a company with multiple mid-to-late stage drugs and a strong pipeline.Incyte with its drug, epacadostat, would fit the bill. Epacadostat belongs to a class of drugs that teach the immune system to identify camouflaged cancer cells. AstraZeneca (AZN), Tesaro and Clovis Oncology are all working on ovarian cancer drugs that belong to a class called PARP inhibitors.Companies like Seattle Genetics (SGEN) are working on classical Hodgkin lymphoma.Wall Street has long harped on Gilead to seek a deal like its acquisitions of Triangle Pharma in 2002 and Pharmasset in 2011. Meacham calls those deals ""literally among the best deals ever consummated in the history of the biopharma industry.""""We admire Gilead's discipline, especially through the valuation peaks and troughs in the biotech/pharma sector, but too much patience has put immense pressure on Gilead shares,"" Meacham wrote. ""By far and away, our fear is that as quarterly operating cash flow declines ... so does Gilead's capacity to do a meaningful transaction.""RELATED:How Gilead Is Paying The Price For Actually Curing A Disease

117,INCY,"Exelixis (EXEL) is taking a page out of Incyte's (INCY) playbook, teaming up with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Roche (RHHBY) to test its Cabometyx and their immuno-oncology (I-O) drugs in liver and bladder cancer.In the stock market today, Exelixis stock flirted with a 16-year-plus high it touched on Tuesday, as the company announced its collaborations with Bristol-Myers and Roche. Shares came within 10 cents of eclipsing that Tuesday high of 23.49, rising 6.5% to 23.09. It helped lift IBD's 423-company Biomed/Biotech industry group 4.2%, as did 7%-plus gains by Bluebird Bio (BLUE) and Cara Therapeutics (CARA).""Planned phase 3 trials, if successful, could support potential label expansion for Cabometyx in several additional indications, including first-line kidney cancer, bladder cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and potentially other tumor types,"" Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt said in a research note.Cabometyx inhibits tyrosine kinases and VEGFR2 receptors to slow tumor growth, metastasis and angiogenesis. It is approved as a monotherapy for second-line advanced renal cell carcinoma.I-O partnerships are nothing new. Merck (MRK) is testing out its PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda in conjunction with Incyte's IDO inhibitor epacadostat (not yet approved) in five tumor types. Bristol-Myers also has teamed up with Horizon Pharma (HZNP) in advanced solid tumors.IBD'S TAKE: There are more than 1,000 I-O trials underway right now, analysts estimate. But only a small handful of I-O drugs have actually been approved. Who's leading the sector in terms of approvals? Head to IBD's Technology page for the best opportunities in I-O.Exelixis and Bristol will focus on first-line RCC and have trials planned in HCC and bladder cancer, the companies said Monday. Exelixis' outside-U.S./Japan partner Ipsen will participate in the RCC trial. Exelixis' Japan partner Takeda Pharmaceuticals has the opportunity to do so.Partnering in the phase 3 trial will help Exelixis shave off some costs, Schmidt wrote. Exelixis' Cabometyx will be combined with Bristol's Opdivo and Yervoy — respectively, PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors.""While detailed economics with Bristol-Myers were not disclosed in the press release, Exelixis may potentially end up paying as little as 20%-25% of these trial costs given the 50-50 cost split with Bristol-Myers,"" he wrote.Exelixis and Roche will combine Cabometyx and Tecentriq, a PD-L1 inhibitor, in a phase 1b escalation study in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors, they said. The trials will begin enrolling in mid-2017.The trial will look at first-line advanced clear cell RCC and three cohorts of urothelial carcinoma. Exelixis will sponsor the study with Roche contributing Tecentriq. Ipsen will participate and contribute 35% of the costs.

118,INCY,"Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Allergan (AGN) stand to outperform broad pharma stocks in 2017, a Credit Suisse analyst said Monday, citing their strong pipelines and expected clinical data this year.Merck stock closed down 1.5% at 64.15 on the stock market today. Shares of Allergan dipped 0.2% to 240.65, and Lilly finished 0.3% lower at 84.14. Drug stocks were down broadly, but stayed above their 50-day moving average.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan expects macro uncertainty to pressure drug stocks in the first half of 2017, continuing a trend that began in 2016 with the raucous election season. Drug stocks ended 2016 down 27%, though are up 2.3% since January.Merck will outperform on Keytruda, its immuno-oncology drug, Divan said. Keytruda and similar drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Roche (RHHBY) teach a patient's immune system to identify tumor cells. The immune system then destroys cancer.Keytruda goes head-to-head against Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo in that both target a specific protein within the body. Merck is teaming up to test Keytruda with Incyte's (INCY) drug, epacadostat. Epacadostat targets another protein.IBD'S TAKE: Jazz Pharmaceuticals tops IBD's 43-company Ethical Drugs industry group with a Composite Rating of 78 out of a best-possible 99. The score means Jazz outperforms nearly two-thirds of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Get the rest of the leaders list on IBD's Stock Checkup.Lilly's pipeline is now derisked, Divan wrote in a note to clients.

119,INCY,"Activist investor Carl Icahn has reportedly taken a stake in cancer biotech Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) following an investment by Jana Partners in Q4, according to inside sources cited by the Wall Street Journal.In after-hours trading after the rumor broke, Bristol-Myers stock edged up a fraction. Shares rose a fraction in Tuesday's regular session, to 54.78, but they're down 27% over the last six months amid investor worries that Merck (MRK) has the upper hand in the lung cancer market.Merck's Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo both belong to a class of immuno-oncology drugs that target PD-1 checkpoints in a patient's immune system. Roche (RHHBY), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Incyte (INCY) are also working on I-O drugs targeting an array of checkpoints.Last month, the Food and Drug Administration accepted Merck's supplemental filing for Keytruda plus chemo in advanced lung cancer. Bristol said it wouldn't accelerate approval for its Opdivo plus Yervoy combo in the same market. Yervoy is another I-O drug targeting the CTLA-4 checkpoint.IBD'S TAKE: The I-O market could grow to $25 billion by 2025, Barclays analyst Geoffrey Meacham estimates — and those are just the indications we know of in 2017. Dive into the I-O world and its game-changing potential on IBD's Technology page.Bristol declined to comment to IBD regarding Icahn's rumored stake. Insiders reportedly say Icahn sees Bristol-Myers as a potential takeover candidate, the WSJ reported. Bristol-Myers is the ninth-largest biotech by market cap, valued at $91.5 billion.Icahn is known for his investments in household names like PayPal (PYPL) and Xerox (XRX).Last year, he made a big bet on Allergan (AGN), but slashed his stake in November. Shares lost about 11% from the time of his purchase in Q2 to the end of November.Jana Partners, another activist investor, bought a stake in Bristol-Myers in Q4. On Tuesday, Bristol said it would buy back $2 billion of its stock as part of an agreement with Jana.

Sales of $12.32 billion topped analysts' views for $12.31 billion. Novartis reported $1.12 earnings per share ex items, beating by a penny. But both metrics declined 2% vs. last year.Jakavi sales came in at $162 million for Q4 and $581 million for 2016, up a respective 36% and 42% vs. the year-earlier periods. On those sales, Simeonidis estimates that partner Incyte will reap $34.4 million in Q4 and $111.9 million in 2016.Those royalties would be up 46% and 50%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. Royalties are also expected now to top broader consensus views for $32.5 million in Q4. Incyte is scheduled to report its Q4 and 2016 earnings on Feb. 14.Incyte and Novartis are partnered on ruxolitinib, the drug branded as Jakavi and Jakafi.

Shares had run up to a 10-year high on Jan. 23, rising 207% over the course of four months through Friday's close.But shares crashed Monday after Schmidt downgraded Array stock to market perform from outperform.

123,INCY,"Nuveen Large Cap Growth Opportunities Fund's (FIGWX) recent surge since the elections and since the Federal Reserve's December rate hike has given retirement-account and other investors reason to cheer.In the trailing three months going into Thursday, the $300 million fund's 10.45% gain topped 93% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc., all of which averaged an 8.66% advance. The broad market, measured by the S&P 500, gained 8.33%.For the Nuveen fund, that's way better than the mere 34% of direct rivals it outpaced in the past 12 months with a not-so-shabby 24.20% return.The difference between now and the earlier period? Within their overall investment approach, fund managers Harold Goldstein and David Chalupnik favored stocks likely to get an extra tailwind from the elections and from rising rates. Those had to be stocks that fit their basic approach, which is the pursuit of stocks they think will have faster earnings growth than the market expects.They paid for that by cutting stable and defensive consumer staples stocks by 7% in the fourth quarter and consumer discretionary stocks by 6%, the fund's fourth-quarter commentary notes.The managers pumped up their financials by 7%, mostly the day after the elections. They boosted technology by about 3% and energy by 2%.They began positions in Signature Bank (SBNY), SVB Financial (SIVB), Raymond James (RJF) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD).All of those newcomers have very strong Composite Ratings from IBD in the high 80s or 90s. The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.In addition to a sterling 96 Comp Rating, SVB Financial is the No. 3-ranked bank in IBD's superregional industry group, thanks to growth metrics like four years in a row of earnings per share (EPS) growth and a 39.7% annual pretax margin.IBD'S TAKE: SVB Financial is ranked No. 3 in the No. 1-rated Banks-Super Regional group. See which superregional bank is No. 1, and how these financials stack up on easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data at IBD's Stock Checkup.The bank is headquartered in Silicon Valley, a hotbed of innovation. Its nonbanking businesses include asset management, private wealth management, brokerage and investment services, funds management, and business valuation services.Raymond James is No. 2 in IBD's Finance-Investment Bank-Bankers group. It is propelled by factors like its fourth-quarter 47% EPS growth and eight straight quarters of increasing ownership by mutual funds.In tech, the fund opened a position in Broadcom (AVGO), a chipmaking company whose EPS growth has accelerated for three quarters. On IBD's Leaderboard, the company makes analog and digital semiconductor systems for wireless communications and broadband communications.Goldstein and Chalupnik like the semiconductor space's economic sensitivity. And they like Broadcom's role among leaders of consolidation within its industry.In energy, the fund added new positions in Concho Resources (CXO) and Parsley Energy (PE), and added to its stake in Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD).""(We) added exposure to several growth-oriented exploration and production firms as a result of the generally improved outlook for oil pricing and supply,"" the managers wrote.In health care, the fund's overall weight stayed basically unchanged in the immediate postelection period. But the fund made individual stock moves.It started a stake in Incyte (INCY), which the managers call a fast-growing young biotech firm with an exciting pipeline of cancer-fighting treatments.To pay for Incyte, the fund used proceeds from the sale of two drugmakers, Allergan (AGN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), which it had owned a long time.The managers think Allergan has grown so large that it can no longer grow much faster than its industry. They sold Bristol-Meyers because test results dimmed the outlook for a lung cancer therapy it was developing.The managers summarized their approach this way: ""The portfolio continues to be reasonably balanced from a sector standpoint as well as measured by other factors. The fund's largest overweight is in the area of companies with high growth potential that we believe can perform well somewhat independent of the economic cycle. We are always looking for exceptional growth companies that we believe have solid and/or improving fundamentals, a reasonable valuation and an approaching catalyst.""RELATED:Why This Victory Munder Fund Likes Semiconductor Gear Makers And Non-ObamaCare Health StocksWhere Mutual Fund Bigwigs Expect To See Stock Gains In 2017

126,INCY,"Incyte (INCY) could pull in $4.8 billion in 2026 peak sales on its Merck (MRK) partnership alone, Goldman Sachs analyst Salveen Richter said Friday — and that's without noting collaborations with AstraZeneca (AZN), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Roche (RHHBY).But those collaborations with AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers and Roche don't target the substantial non-small cell lung cancer market, an opportunity that Richter pegs at $2.7 billion in 2026 peak sales. And whether Incyte goes that route will likely depend on whether Merck pushes for exclusivity, she says.Richter boosted her price target Friday on Incyte stock to 149 from 116, and kept her buy rating. In the stock market today, Incyte stock rose 0.9% to 121.72. Shares are up 21% for the year but are now extended from a 110.05 buy point out of a flat base first touched on Jan. 9.Incyte's epacadostat is an immune-oncology, or I-O, drug, as are Keytruda from Merck, Opdivo and Yervoy from Bristol-Myers, Tecentriq from Roche and durvalumab from AstraZeneca. These therapies target PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4 and IDO molecules, which act as ""brakes"" on the immune system, providing a negative signal to T cells.IBD'S TAKE: Incyte has a slew of potential blockbusters, and not all in the immune-oncology sector. Dive into The New America for a deeper analysis for more ""Incyte"" into those potential markets.Tumor cells apply the brakes to prevent their destruction by the immune system, Richter explained. I-O drugs remove the brake, allowing T cells to attack the tumor. Combinations of I-O drugs are thought to be more potent than combining I-O with chemo (though Merck is testing that too).""Based on encouraging early data from epacadostat in combinations with Keytruda, we view Incyte's IDO (inhibitor) as one of the leading 'add-ons' to PD-1/PD-L1,"" she wrote in a research report.Merck and Bristol-Myers are often seen as going head-to-head in the I-O space as their Keytruda and Opdivo both target PD-1 and are approved as monotherapies for melanoma, advanced lung cancer, and head and neck cancer. Both firms are also working on combos.This month, though, Merck announced an expanded collaboration with Incyte to test Keytruda and epacadostat in a total of five tumor types: first-line melanoma, advanced lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck cancer and bladder cancer.Incyte's epacadostat is safe as a monotherapy, but only 29% of advanced melanoma patients in an earlier phase 1 trial could achieve a stable disease. In an earlier combo of epacadostat and Yervoy, 31% of patients hit an overall response rate. But toxicity also rose in the liver.""In our view, this result highlights the potential for I-O/I-O synergies with IDO, with a continued focus on finding the most effective I-O doublets as second generation immunotherapies continue to emerge,"" Richter said.She sees Incyte hitting $2.7 billion in 2026 peak sales in the NSCLC market alone. But that estimate could be conservative. Incyte could also team up with AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers and Roche in NSCLC, pending the details of exclusivity with Merck.Outside its partnership with Merck, Incyte is already testing epacadostat with AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers and Roche in treating other types of cancer.Editor's Note: Corrects fourth paragraph to correctly identify the Roche and AstraZeneca drugs.RELATED:Bristol-Myers Topples On 2017 Guidance Cut Amid Merck I-O RivalryCould Merck's 'Meaningful' Keytruda Royalty Give Bristol-Myers A Leg Up?Biotech Stocks Might Catalyze, Or Plunge, On These 4 Key Sectors In 2017

127,INCY,"The biotech industry has a mixed outlook for 2017 with few new drugs coming to market this year, but midcap Incyte (INCY) is one of the few companies with potential blockbusters in its pipeline.Incyte closed out 2016 and started 2017 with some major developments. The first came late last year when the company discovered that its Jakafi drug won't be facing competition from Gilead (GILD) in 2018 as previously expected. Jakafi is used to treat two maladies: myelofibrosis, a bone marrow disorder, and polycythemia vera, a type of blood cancer.Gilead's rival drug to Jakafi, now known as momelotinib, failed a Phase 3 study for previously untreated myelofibrosis patients in November. That left Incyte's primary revenue driver free of competition for the foreseeable future, according to Ian Somaiya, a biotech analyst at BMO Capital Markets.""It's rare to see a drug that can generate $2.5 billion to $3 billion (in sales) and face no competition,"" he said of Jakafi's peak sales potential. In its most recent earnings report, Incyte officials said Jakafi accounted for $224 million in net product revenue in the third quarter, up 39% from the year before. The company raised its full-year net sales outlook on the drug to $850 million-$855 million from an earlier outlook of $825 million-$835 million.Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note to clients Tuesday that they see the drug's revenue growing 13% a year.Then earlier this month, Incyte announced its immuno-oncology drug, epacadostat, along with Merck's (MRK) Keytruda, will be used in four Phase 3 studies this year. They include treatment of non-small lung cancer as well as renal, bladder and head and neck cancers.""The opportunities in solid tumors could be a (earnings) multiplier"" for epacadostat, Somaiya said.If the drug passes the trials and receives Food and Drug Administration approval, analysts expect $1.6 billion in peak sales, according to a recent Goldman Sachs note.Morgan Stanley analysts said in their note that they expect key data from the studies that prompted the companies to start a Phase 3 trial will be disclosed at the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference in Chicago in June.""Epacadostat has the potential at least to be one of the biggest pipeline drugs,"" said Eric Schmidt, biotechnology analyst at Cowen. ""It could be active against so many tumor types.""Finally, on Jan. 13 the FDA extended its review period of baricitinib, and investigational rheumatoid arthritis drug jointly developed by Incyte and Eli Lilly (LLY). But Morgan Stanley took that as a bullish sign that the FDA didn't ask for any new studies and sees ""imminent approval.""Still, analysts lowered its U.S. sales estimates for the drug to $98 million from $197 million for the 2017 on the delay. Yet they see peak sales of $1.8 billion in 2026.Management has played a key role in Incyte's success in recent years. Incyte Chief Executive Herve Hoppenot, who took the helm in 2014, was previously the president of oncology at Novartis (NVS). Many scientists on the oncology side followed Hoppenot to Incyte.""What always made Incyte unique is the expertise in biology,"" Somaiya said. ""With the management changes, you have that expertise to develop those drugs, conduct larger trials, bring those drugs to the market and independently market them.""But analysts question how much longer the company will remain independent. Incyte is the largest midsize company in the oncology space and a potential buyout target.The endgame for most biotechs is to be bought by a larger pharmaceutical firm that has a ""less fruitful pipeline"" according to Michael Schmidt, senior biotech analyst at Leerink Partners. He is no relation to Cowen's Eric Schmidt.IBD'S TAKE: Incyte is ranked second in IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech Group and has a 94 composite rating. Shares jumped into buy range out of a flat base with a 110.05 buy point on Jan. 9, after the company announced its drug trails for epacadostat.""Oncology pipelines are very interesting from an M&A standpoint. There's scarcity of companies that have a good pipeline,"" Michael Schmidt said. But he wouldn't speculate on what companies could be interested in Incyte.In a September poll by the Evercore ISI investment bank, analysts voted Gilead as the most likely to buy out Incyte in the next 12 months.Despite President Donald Trump calling out the drug industry over ""disastrous"" drug prices, merger activity could heat up this year. Under a Trump administration, there could be changes in the tax code, as well as a possible boost in foreign cash and increased stock valuations, according to a Reuters report.While Incyte is poised for a successful 2017, the biotech world isn't without risks.""Beyond the traditional drug development risks, there is always regulatory risks,"" Michael Schmidt said. ""And oncology is obviously a competitive space, particularly immuno-oncology.""But Cowen's Eric Schmidt said he's not worried about competition in the oncology sector.""There is too much unmet need, too many patients are dying,"" he said, adding that valuation is the prime risk.""The biggest risk is that there is a fair bit of good news priced into Incyte,"" he said. ""So if something goes wrong valuation could come in and correct a lot.""Shares of Incyte seemed ready to hit a third straight day of gains, but met resistance after crossing the 120 mark on Friday. Shares ended Monday's session up marginally to 117.42.RELATED: FDA Track Record Bodes Well For Merck Keytruda Plus Chemo: LeerinkAmgen Plans Robust 2017 In Alzheimer's, Migraines, Oncology: CEO Exclusive

128,INCY,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) stock tumbled to a 22-month low Wednesday after the No. 2 biotech said its hepatitis C unit will see fewer patients and more pricing competition in 2017.In the stock market today, Gilead stock fell 8.6% to 66.83 and hit its lowest price since April 2014. Late Tuesday, Gilead guided to $7.5 billion to $9 billion in 2017 hep C drug sales, about $4 billion short of Wall Street's expectations.Unlike HIV, hep C is a curable disease, said Kevin Young, Gilead's chief operating officer, on the company's earnings conference call with analysts late Tuesday. Gilead sees huge promise on its growing HIV and antiviral franchise, which brought in 47% of sales in Q4.""This (hep C) disease has unique dimensions, the most important of which is that it can be cured,"" he said on the call. ""And thanks to Harvoni, it can be cured in as little as eight weeks in a genotype 1 patient.""Gilead saw 25,000 fewer hep C patients in 2016 vs. 2015 and expects a similar trend this year. Young noted a greater number of patients have a less advanced disease or circumstances that prevent them from immediate treatment such as unstable living situations.IBD'S TAKE: Gilead could bulk its HIV and NASH units to overcome slipping hepatitis C sales, some analysts say. But that view is largely contended by analysts who see those businesses and too late to make much of a difference.In Europe, Gilead's hep C drug sales declined 26% year over year in Q4, trailing a 77% slowdown in Japan where 40% of patients are over the age of 80. Countries like Germany, France and the UK are exhibiting similar characteristics as the U.S. — fewer and healthier patients.Analyst broadly predicted Gilead stock will remain range-bound, and some say the company is unlikely to grow in the near term unless it engages in M&A. On the call, CEO John Milligan acknowledged that besides its HIV pill bictegravir, Gilead doesn't have much launching soon.""We don't think Gilead will do a major M&A deal above $20 billion (Incyte (INCY) makes sense but not likely) so Gilead must do three to four smaller deals and hit next two quarters to regain Street attention,"" RBC analyst Michael Yee wrote Wednesday in a research report.Gilead isn't planning to divest its hep C assets, Evercore analyst Mark Schoenebaum wrote in a note Wednesday. But it's hard to know when Gilead will return to growth, he wrote. Total product sales declined 14% in Q4 and 6.8% in 2016.Gilead's recently launched Epclusa helped offset falling sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a research note.RELATED:AbbVie, Merck Pressure Gilead's 2017 Hep C Unit; GSK Battles HIV BizJ&J HCV Dip To 'Virtually Zero,' Mirroring Gilead; 2017 Views LagGilead Clobbered On Hep C; 'Little Value' In 'Too Late' NASH, HIV Units

129,INCY,"American Century All-Cap Growth Fund (TWGTX) is enjoying an uptick in performance so far this year relative to its large-cap growth rivals. The outperformance stems from recent gains by the type of stocks it has long favored: U.S. stocks with sustainable accelerating growth. Two of the places it's finding those are in internet leaders and electronic payment platforms. The surge has $1 billion All-Cap Growth pointing back in the direction of its long-term outperformance.So far in this young year, the fund is up 3.31%, going into Thursday. That tops 66% of its peers tracked by Morningstar Inc., all of which averaged a 3.04% gain as the S&P 500 rose 1.56%. The fund topped 49% of its direct rivals over the past year. It beat 90% of its peer group over the past 10 years.During the fund's year-to-date romp, best performing investments included such top holdings as social media giant Facebook (FB), with a good 90 Composite Rating from IBD, which is up 11% this year. The social network has entered the enterprise software market with a business collaboration suite called Workplace. Workplace is a challenge to a lot of intraoffice email. It looks almost identical to Facebook itself. But it gives businesses the ability to guide conversations back to work topics.Trading near 128, Facebook is building the right side of a cup base with a 133.60 buy point.Alphabet (GOOGL), the No. 1 holding as of Nov. 30, jumped 4.6% this year. Trading around 829, Alphabet is within the buy range of its 824.40 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. EPS grew 16%, 20% and 23% the past three quarters.Earnings growth is expected to toggle between 17% this year to 19% next year and back down to 17% the year after, according to Thomson Reuters.And credit-and-debit card titan MasterCard (MA), No. 5 in the portfolio, is up 5.2% this year. Sporting a nice 82 Comp Rating — a 99 Comp Rating is the highest possible — its EPS growth has gone from a 12% decline to a 13% and 19% gain in the three most recent quarters. It benefits from rising use of mobile digital payments.While the fund's prospectus allows managers David Hollond, Michael Orndorff and Marcus Scott to invest in companies of all sizes, about 75% of shareholder money was in large caps as of Sept. 30, according to Morningstar. Information technology was the fund's largest sector as of Dec. 31, with a 31% weighting. Consumer discretionary was next with a 21% weighting.In addition to Facebook and Alphabet, tech-oriented holdings included Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) among top holdings as of Nov. 30. Broadcom (AVGO) and Applied Materials (AMAT) were two additional tech names.Broadcom is on IBD's Leaderboard. The company makes analog and digital semiconductor systems for wireless communications and other applications. IBD's Patrick Seitz recently detailed why at least six investment banks have increased their price targets for the stock. One key reason is Broadcom's three quarters in a row of accelerating sales and earnings growth. The bulk of gains stem from Broadcom's merger with Avago, which closed in February.Applied Materials is in the IBD 50.IBD'S TAKE: Applied Materials is No. 1 in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment industry group. To see how the company's growth metrics — like its top-notch 99 IBD Composite Rating and three quarters of accelerating EPS growth — stack up against its rivals, visit IBD Stock Checkup.Among other holdings, veterinary services provider VCA (WOOF) is up 32% and sports a very strong 94 Composite Rating from IBD. Its shares got a boost from news this month that candy maker Mars plans to acquire VCA.Biotech Incyte (INCY) is another top performer, up 15%, with a 94 Comp Rating.Incyte broke out earlier this month. It opened Thursday still within a buy range, trading just shy of 5% above its 110.05 buy point. Earnings per share grew at a triple-digit pace in five of the past six quarters. In the sixth frame, EPS growth declined.Its products in development treat pancreatic cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. In a report on Wednesday, JMP Securities reiterated its outperform rating on Incyte and said it has a 130.00 price target on the stock. The biopharmaceutical is trading around 115.RELATED:Hot Mutual Fund Manager Dissects Leading Holdings Like Facebook, AlphabetHot Stocks That Made Craig Hodges 2016's Top Mutual Fund Manager

130,INCY,"Eli Lilly (LLY), Pfizer (PFE) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) are chipping away at AbbVie's (ABBV) Humira sales, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said Monday after AbbVie missed Q3 expectations Friday, primarily on declining Humira sales.Divan downgraded AbbVie stock to neutral and cut his price target to 60 from 70. He models immunosuppressant Humira pulling in $18.1 billion in 2018 sales, declining to $11.3 billion and $5.2 billion in 2022 and 2025, respectively.Humira accounted for 63% of AbbVie sales in Q3. The drug is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and irritable bowel disorder — markets where branded rivals are already on the market and biosimilars are pressuring AbbVie's patent on Humira.AbbVie is working to protect that patent, but Divan expects Amgen (AMGN) and others to have biosimilars on the market by 2022.""Whether it is in 2020, 2021, 2022 or some other year, at some point Humira will start to decline,"" Divan wrote in his research report. To cope with Humira's decline (it missed Q3 expectations by $100 million), AbbVie has eight late-stage drugs capable of bringing in $25 billion to $30 billion in combined sales.IBD'S TAKE: AbbVie's earnings have grown an average 20% over the past five quarters, but have also declined for the last three periods. Get the full scoop in IBD's Income Investor.Pfizer, Eli Lilly/Incyte (INCY) and Gilead are all working on a class of drugs called JAK inhibitors that could compete in arthritis.Celgene (CELG), Novartis (NVS) and Eli Lilly have IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors for psoriasis, and all three expected to become blockbuster drugs within five years of their launches.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) already has a JAK inhibitor and is in the IL-23 field. AbbVie has its own IL-23 drug in development, but ""it will be entering into a crowded market where it will have more competitive and pricing challenges,"" said Divan.In the irritable bowel disorder market, Celgene's mongersen and ozanimod could put pressure on Humira sales as soon as 2020-22, Divan wrote.But UBS analyst Marc Goodman says the pressure on AbbVie stock is overdone. Shares touched a seven-month low Friday after AbbVie reported its Q3 earnings, which fell 6.2%. In the stock market today, AbbVie stock fell 3.2% to 55.78.Goodman kept his buy rating and 73 price target on AbbVie stock, though the company's 2017 earnings guidance for 13%-15% growth in 2017 implied $4.43-$5.53, which was lower than Wall Street's $5.62 view.Still, Goodman wrote that ""based on management's commentary on Humira volume and pricing, we think the concerns appear overdone. The earnings for next year are a little light, but we think the investment in the pipeline should drive growth in the longer term.""RELATED:Eli Lilly, AbbVie Top 2017 Rankings; Pfizer, AstraZeneca Flailing

131,INCY,"Incyte (INCY) is a prime M&A candidate, RBC analyst Simos Simeonidis said Friday after the drugmaker revealed ""deep and durable"" results for a med that aims to treat advanced and metastatic melanoma.""We view Incyte as a throwback to what biotech companies were originally meant to be,"" Simeonidis wrote in a research report, ""companies built on great science, which managed to develop multiple drugs while reinvesting heavily in their own R&D engine.""But he doesn't offer a guess at which companies might take a crack at buying Incyte. A poll by Evercore ISI investment bank last month identified Gilead (GILD) as a likely buyer for Incyte.Early Friday, Incyte revealed the results of its epacadostat combination with Merck's (MRK) pembrolizumab. The combination faces off with Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) nivolumab (Opdivo) in combination with ipilimumab (Yervoy).Incyte-Merck didn't reach progression-free survival, or PFS, during three months of follow-up after the March 28 data cutoff. BMS-Opdivo's combination has a median PFS of 11.5 months, Simeonidis wrote.""This increases our confidence that the combination of Epacadostat plus Pembrolizumab will end up with a median PFS that will be superior to the Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab combination,"" he wrote.Simeonidis also noted that 83% (5 out of 6) patients receiving the combination of drugs from Incyte and Merck responded to treatment. He has an outperform rating on Incyte stock, which rose 3.2% to 97.83 on the stock market today. Incyte broke out at a 92.92 buy point on Sept. 28, so is within buy range, though caution is advised during a volatile time for the market.Merck stock rose 0.2% to 62.77 on Friday.IBD'S TAKE: This isn't the first time Incyte has appeared on an analyst's M&A hot list.

"
132,INCY,"BioMarin Pharmaceuticals (BMRN), Kite Pharma (KITE) and Incyte (INCY) pulled a collective thumbs up Friday as Goldman Sachs upgraded its small cap and midcap biotech stock group to an attractive rating, citing R&D catalysts.That did little to help IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group, which closed down 0.1% on the stock market today but stayed above its 50-day line. The group is down 17 % for the year, but 2017 could be a turning point, says Goldman Sachs analyst Salveen Richter.""Macro headwinds from drug pricing political rhetoric are likely to persist through year's end 2016, however, we see this group as relatively better positioned under a new administration than those relying on re-pricing of branded drugs,"" she wrote in a research report.Richter likes four vertical markets: central nervous system disorders, immuno-oncology, gene therapies and rare diseases.In the CNS circle, Richter recommends AveXis (AVXS), GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH) and Sage Therapeutics (SAGE). She rates them all a buy, with respective price targets of 71, 189 and 65.CNS drugs have faced a maelstrom of challenges for FDA approval. Now, ""we believe the molecular biology of the CNS is coming of age, spurred by a renewed interest in drug development in the space,"" Richter wrote.Bluebird (BLUE) also is active in the CNS market, working on a drug to treat congenital cerebral adreno-leukodystrophy.Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Merck (MRK), Roche (RHHBY) and AstraZeneca (AZN) are already in the immuno-oncology space, but Richter keys in on Incyte and Kite. A number of IO therapies work by introducing molecules to act as ""brakes"" on the immune system, providing a negative signal to tumor cells.Incyte, too, is working on a ""brake,"" Richter writes.""We view Incyte's epacadostat (which applies a 'brake' called IDO) as the next-generation checkpoint inhibitor,"" she wrote. Incyte and Merck recently yielded encouraging results by combining IDO and Keystruda to combat melanoma in a Phase 1 study.She has buy ratings on Incyte stock, which broke out on Sept. 28, and Kite stock, and respective price targets of 105 and 70.Richter recommends Bluebird and AveXis in gene therapies which ""could provide potential one-shot cures in areas of high unmet need."" Most drugs for genetic disorders treat symptoms vs. the actual disease, she writes.""Gene therapy is designed to address the underlying genetic defect by introducing a long-term (permanent) reservoir of functional genes into the patient,"" she wrote. But only two treatments have been approved — and neither in the U.S.Still, there's room for AveXis, Bluebird, BioMarin and Spark Therapeutics (ONCE) to differentiate themselves as leaders in the space. All four have highly impressive clinical proof of concept, Richter wrote. Of the four, Spark stock alone get a neutral rating. The rest are rated buy.Richter expects Spark's voretigene neparvovec, a treatment for genetic blindness, to lead the way in setting regulatory, pricing and manufacturing standards as it appears prepped for FDA approval in 2017.BioMarin, Sanofi (SNY) and Shire (SHPG) lead on the rare disease front, but Richter only recommends the former — a midsize cap headed for large-size territory with a nearly $16 billion market cap. Incyte, too, is approaching large-cap size with its $18.2 billion market cap.Sanofi and Shire use enzyme-replacement therapies (ERT) to combat rare genetic disorders. The ERT models allows for premium pricing ($200,000 to $600,000 per year), lower expenses and regulatory hurdles, shorter development cycles, limited competition and tax incentives.But BioMarin is one step ahead, Richter says. She has a buy rating and 128 price target on BioMarin sock.""In contrast to chronic ERT drugs, gene therapy is designed to provide patients with a constant genetic source of correct protein and, in theory, no additional dosing events would be required,"" she wrote.IBD'S TAKE: BioMarin and Incyte are encroaching on large-cap territory, Richter says. But Amgen by far leads the space with a $125.1 billion market cap. Biogen leads IBD's 421-company group with a Composite Rating of 98, out of a best-possible 99.

133,INCY,"Eli Lilly (LLY) and AbbVie (ABBV) topped a Credit Suisse evaluation of pharmaceutical companies heading into 2017, leaving more challenged Pfizer (PFE), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) in the dust.But the PharmaValues 2017 list did little for IBD's 44-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group, which fell a fraction on the stock market today, a fifth consecutive down day. The group is down more than 20% this year, touched a three-month low Monday and is trading below its 50-day moving average.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech and pharmaceutical stocks have been trampled in the last month. With Q3 earnings reports coming up, can they climb the ""wall of worry?""Credit Suisse ranked 48 Big Pharma stocks on factors like enterprise value/net present value, pricing and replacement powers, and sales growth. Overall, Eli Lilly topped the list, with Europe-based Sanofi (SNY) and Novartis (NVS) trailing closely.AbbVie ranked highest on fundamentals, with investors likely assuming a long life span for Humira, Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a research report. Humira is the brand name for adalimumab, Abbvie's drug to treat arthritis, plaque psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.AbbVie stock, though, slipped a small fraction Monday, while Lilly stock fell nearly 1%.Meanwhile, Pfizer was ""weak across the board,"" AstraZeneca has a high EV/NPV (enterprise value to net present value) and Novo Nordisk is exposed to U.S. pricing pressure.For AstraZeneca, investors are potentially factoring in its oncology pipeline, Credit Suisse says, but ""recent results from others demonstrate significant risk.""Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) scored well in EV/NPV valuation, with most of its sales power driven by its generic division. Gilead Sciences (GILD), Incyte (INCY) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are all trading at a discount with Vertex only needing ""minimal further pipeline success to justify the current valuation,"" the report said.Among biotechs, Vertex topped Credit Suisse's list, with Amgen (AMGN) flailing at the bottom. Like pharmaceuticals, IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group, has been down this month. The group fell a fraction Monday and, like the ethical drugs group, also fell for a fifth straight trading day, and fell for the seventh day of the past eight trading days.Though near the bottom overall, AstraZeneca scored well in terms of pricing power with its shift toward oncology products. But Novo Nordisk is in ""the eye"" of the diabetes-rebate storm in the U.S., Credit Suisse said.Pricing power, Credit Suisse analysts note, is important as it helps ""companies to resist discount pressures from formulary managers and governments."" In that regard, Allergan (AGN) is the clear winner, with only Shire (SHPG) rivaling it in the dry-eye market.Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), which focuses on rare diseases, is the most exceptional biotech, the analysts said, while Biomarin (BMRN), Incyte and Vertex also get high marks for being unique.Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Eli Lilly beat out the cohort on R&D productivity and ability to drive the current pipeline.This follows the dramatic seesaw between Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck (MRK) after Bristol-Myers' lung cancer drug, Opdivo, failed to meet a key endpoint. Eli Lilly scored well on its launches of Trulicity for diabetes and Taltz for psoriasis.

134,INCY,"Biotech Gilead (GILD) is most likely to scoop up Incyte (INCY) over the next 12 months, according to a survey of 244 industry watchers by Evercore ISI investment bank, ahead of the presidential election pitting Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.Of those surveyed, 16% say they'd most like to see Gilead purchase Incyte, and 14% identified Incyte as the biopharma most likely to be acquired over the next year. Nearly 12% and 10%, respectively, see Biogen (BIIB) and BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) as targets.Gilead, Acadia Pharmaceuticals (ACAD), Celgene (CELG) and Kite Pharma (KITE) are least likely to be targeted, with only 2% of industry experts identifying each as a likely takeover candidate. That's a departure from Needham's analysis last week identifying 11 potential suitors for Acadia.An Incyte takeover would likely come at a heavy price. As of June 30, Gilead had $24.6 billion in cash, equivalents and market securities on hand. By market cap, Gilead is the No. 2 biotech, trailing only Amgen, but it's widely viewed as among the big biotechs that most needs to be active on the M&A front. Incyte has a $17 billion market capitulation. Smaller coalitions, 10% and 8%, say Gilead could buy Vertex (VRTX) or Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).Outside M&A, the lion's share of experts (52%) expect biotechs to outperform the broader markets over the next six months, whereas 54% of respondents say biopharmas will merely be in line. Both will trade up after the election, say 65% of experts.But IBD's 241-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group is down 16% this year, but those losses were early in the year, when the overall market tumbled. The group is up more than 25% since late June and now ranks No. 6 out of 197 groups tracked, up from No. 160 just 13 weeks ago.At the close on the stock market today, the group was up more than 1.4%, bucking a two-day downtrend.IBD'S TAKE: The latest Industry Snapshot explores biotech M&A and promising new drugs, and which stocks are leading the biotech sector.Drug pricing initiatives could rout stocks this year, an RBC analyst said Thursday. Though he acknowledged drugmakers like Amgen (AMGN), Gilead, Celgene, Biogen, Regeneron (REGN) and Vertex could easily find loopholes to skirt new regulations.Still, fewer than 1% of the people polled by Evercore expect the government to take meaningful action on drug pricing in 2016. Nearly 44% (the largest chunk) say the government won't ever push for a reduction in drug prices.Other predictions stem around specific companies. Only 14% expect Eli Lilly's (LLY) Alzheimer's drug, Solanezumab, to hit cognition and function endpoints. More broadly, 42% say it will hit cognition but miss on function.More than half (51%) say Celgene's Phase 3 testing for GED-0301, an oral mongersen treatment for Crohn's, will fail to reach the overwhelming efficacy seen in Phase 2 testing. During Phase 2, 67% of patients taking 160 milligrams were in clinical remission on day 15.A small 7% say Celgene will see better results in Phase 3 testing. Only 3% expect the study to fail entirely. If the results show endoscopic improvement, 64% of respondents say Celgene stock will pop. A third expect shares to remain stagnant.RELATED:Gilead 'Paralyzed' On Likely Hep C Share LossAmgen, Biogen, Gilead Could Spike VA Pricing To Skirt California MeasureRegeneron Pharmaceuticals Falls As Combo Therapy Worse Than Eylea Alone

136,INCY,"Recent Wall Street darling Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) isn't the only potential takeover candidate among hot, or potentially hot, biotech companies, says RBC Capital Markets.In a research report Wednesday, RBC analysts list Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIA), Spark Therapeutics (ONCE), BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN), Aerie Pharmaceuticals (AERI), Intra-Cellular Therapies (ITCI), Tesaro (TSRO), Incyte (INCY) and Puma Biotechnology (PBYI) -- as well as Sarepta — as top takeover contenders, all on their late-stage or FDA-approved ""blockbuster franchises.""Sarepta stock rocketed 74% on Monday after the FDA approved its drug to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the first drug approved to treat the rare disease. Sarepta stock hit another all-time high Wednesday, above 58 for the first time since March 2002. Sarepta closed up 0.9% to 56.22 in the stock market today.After the close, Sarepta announced plans to offer up to $225 million in stock to finance further trials, production and other drug efforts. But shares were little changed late.IBD's 214-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group rose 0.5% Wednesday, its sixth straight gain and touching an eight-month high intraday. The group ranks No. 8 of 197 groups tracked, up from No. 175 just 13 weeks ago.The second half of 2016 is likely to prove a rallying point for biotech stocks, RBC analysts said.""Biotech sentiment should continue to improve and investors should 'climb the wall of worry' as we get through the year and past the election, which we believe has been mostly based on political rhetoric,"" the analysts wrote.IBD'S TAKE: Many biotechs, and a fair number of stocks overall, have recently hit 52-week highs, and you can check out these stocks — listed by Composite Rating — at IBD's New Highs listing. This is a good feature to check for winning stocks.M&A furor has been heating up in the biotech sector. Over the past 10 months, four biotech acquisitions valued at over $5 billion have been announced, RBC said, along with a smattering of smaller deals. On Tuesday, Allergan (AGN) announced an agreement to acquire liver-disease drugmaker Tobira Therapeutics (TBRA) for as much as $1.7 billion.Among the big deals pending, Pfizer (PFE) is buying Medivation (MDVN) for $14 billion and in June bought Anacor Pharmaceuticals for $5.2 billion. Also, AbbVie (ABBV) is acquiring privately held Stemcentyrx for $10.2 billion. Shire (SHPG) and Baxalta completed their $32 billion merger in June.RELATED:Sarepta Soars As FDA Approves Its Drug To Treat Muscular DystrophyBiotech Stocks Hot As Sarepta Provides Shot In The Arm

137,INCY,"Stocks once again pared slim losses to trade tightly mixed in afternoon trading Monday, as slumping oil stocks continued to offset rising biotechs.The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 were each off less than 0.2%, while the Nasdaq rose fractionally. Volume was tracking lower across the board vs. the same time Friday.Energy, department store retailers and gold stocks led the downside in the stock market today as West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures sank 3% to $47.14 a barrel.But biotech, fiber optic and utility stocks advanced. Medivation (MDVN) gapped up, soaring 20% to a record high in massive trade. Pfizer (PFE) said it will buy the San Francisco-based biotech in a $14 billion deal. Medivation develops drugs to treat prostate and breast cancer.IBD'S TAKE: Which biotechs earn top-notch fundamental and technical ratings? Find out at IBD Stock Checkup now.Among other biotechs, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals (AMPH) rose 4% to a new high in healthy turnover. Shares of the injectable and inhalation products maker are well extended past a 17.90 handle buy point cleared Aug. 9.Incyte (INCY) spiked 7% in heavy volume, snapping a 10-session slide. The blood-cancer drugmaker was named in a BMO Capital Markets report as a possible buyout target.Acacia Communications (ACIA) was the top gainer in the IBD 50, rising 3% to recover its Friday losses. Shares of the recent new issue have rallied more than 400% from their May 13 offering price.IBD 50 losers included Vipshop (VIPS), Shutterstock (SSTK) and New Oriental Education (EDU), down roughly 3% each, though in below-average volume.
"
138,INCY,"Drug stocks slipped Wednesday after rallying earlier in the day, as the politics of drug pricing resurfaced.The IBD Biotech/Biomedical group hit a seven-month high Wednesday morning, as the group continued the momentum started by Monday announcement of Pfizer's (PFE) deal to buy Medivation (MDVN). This raised hopes for more biotech M&A, which continued -- especially for Incyte (INCY) and BioMarin (BMRN), after Gabelli & Co. argued that they made especially attractive targets.Incyte rose more than 7% in early trading on the stock market today but ended the day up just a fraction, at 82.44. BioMarin initially gained almost 9% but then sharply reversed, ending down 4.3%, at 95.13.The proximate cause for the decline seemed to be presidential candidate Hillary Clinton criticizing generic-drug giant Mylan (MYL) for its pricing of allergy treatment EpiPen. While Mylan's multiple price hikes on EpiPen had already attracted discussion within the industry, this week the U.S. Senate got in on the act, demanding that Mylan CEO Heather Bresch explain EpiPen's high price. Clinton weighed in around midday Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: When the long-term outlook gets cloudy, look to IBD's Swing Trader for tips on short-term trading.As we noted this month, the biotech stock rally of the last eight weeks might have been driven partly by the fact that drug pricing had faded within the political debate. The group hit a seven-month high on Aug. 4, which it surpassed early Wednesday.RBC Capital Markets analyst Randall Stanicky wrote in a research note that drug pricing's comeback in politics could be with us for a while.""This is also a stark reminder that political scrutiny on pricing remains high across the sector and unlikely to dissipate anytime soon as we head toward the November election,"" Stanicky wrote.Nonetheless, for those familiar with IBD's chart-reading techniques, there are still leading biotechs that are worth keeping an eye on. Incyte has been bouncing around between the buy and sell zones since it popped out of a cup-with-handle base last month; its financials are also improving, as it's turned more consistently profitable over the last few quarters.Biogen (BIIB) also broke out of a cup-with handle at the start of this month and then blasted right past its buy point the next day on buyout rumors. Since then it's moved sideways, but Wednesday's reversal brought it close to the buy zone again, as it was down more than 3% near 308.Celgene (CELG) has been on the upslope of a consolidation that started in July of last year, and it still hasn't formed a specific buy point. Both Celgene and Biogen are strong stocks overall with Composite Ratings putting them in the top 6% of all stocks.The Generic Drugs group also has been rallying over the last eight weeks, though it's still low-ranked, going from No. 191 to No. 176 on IBD's list on 197 industry groups. The group was up again Wednesday after Lannett (LCI) beat Q4 expectations late Tuesday. Lannett stock jumped 14% Wednesday. Generic drugs, however, are the most direct target of the Senate inquiry. The group fell 2.6% Wednesday after earlier hitting a six-month high. Mylan stock fell 5.5% Wednesday after falling 4.8% Tuesday.RELATED:Hunting For Biotech Stocks?

139,INCY,"Drugmaker Medivation's (MDVN) stock was jumping Monday -- and lifting some other big biotechs with it -- after Pfizer (PFE) announced that it's acquiring the company for $14 billion in cash.The Pfizer-Medivation deal was formally announced after a weekend of leaks and a long campaign by big French pharma Sanofi (SNY) to take over the maker of prostate-cancer drug Xtandi. Sanofi didn't completely rule out making another bid, but its statement on Monday made it sound as though Pfizer's $81.50 a share in cash was too rich for its blood: ""While we recognized the potential strategic benefits of a combination with Medivation, we are first and foremost a disciplined acquirer and remain committed to acting in the best interests of Sanofi shareholders.""Medivation stock rose 20% to 80.42 on the stock market today. Shares of both Pfizer stock fell a fraction Monday.IBD'S TAKE: In the last five weeks, IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech Industry Group has risen from No. 126 to No. 36 out of 197 industry groups. This month, IBD looked at what's driving the biotech stock rally.Jefferies analysts noted that this might reignite speculation that Sanofi turn its attention to rare-disease specialist BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN). In June, BioMarin's stock rose on an anonymously sourced report at the blog Betaville that BioMarin was Sanofi's fallback option. On Monday, BioMarin stock popped 6.7% to 98.17.Meanwhile, Incyte (INCY), maker of the blood-cancer drug Jakafi and a perpetual object of buyout speculation with various partners, rose 7.7% to 81.98.In a research note sizing up several biotech buyout targets, BMO Capital Markets analyst Do Kim wrote that Incyte could go for $14.1 billion to $18.8 billion, based on a valuation of three to four times peak sales. While that wouldn't bring much of an upside to its current market cap of $15 billion, Kim added, ""We believe these companies could potentially command a higher multiple, given the limited number of late-stage clinical and commercial biotechs.""Others he named as likely targets include rare-disease players Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), which rose 3.3% and 3%, respectively, on Monday.RELATED:

140,INCY,"The spectacular rise and even more spectacular collapse of Valeant Pharmaceuticals had multiple causes, but at the heart of the story was how much the biotech company relied on big drug price increases for growth.Not only did those price hikes make Valeant (VRX) politically unpopular, but they also meant the business was ultimately unsustainable. Money managers prefer biotechs and pharmas that produce drugs with growing customer demand, as signaled by growth in sales volume.""As you would think, the preferable avenue for revenue growth is through volume, as significant price increases (like we have seen over the past two years) can only be repeated for a few years,"" Leonard Yaffe, health care portfolio manager at Kessef Capital, told IBD in an email. ""The more the revenue increase is due to volume, the more value is assigned to the drug.""If you're hunting for big growth stocks, and biotechs catch your eye, looking past the headline revenue numbers can help you see which companies might have more sustainable -- and even accelerating -- growth. If volume growth lags sales increases, the company is leaning on price, which might not last.Most price increases are far more moderate than Valeant's 525% and 212% price hikes for heart drugs Nitropress and Isuprel, respectively. But many companies regularly lift their prices well past the inflation rate, which can prop up revenue but disguise actual demand.IBD'S TAKE: Big caps can deliver still deliver big gains, often with less volatility than smaller-cap stocks. That's also true in biotech, which has some strong big-cap companies. Amgen and Biogen are among current residents of the IBD Big Cap 20.Comparing volume and revenue is worthwhile for another reason: If volume growth was more than overall revenue growth, this signals that a company is having to rebate more of its list price than it did last year to move product, and/or is rolling out the drug in countries that extracted a lower price (as is often the case in Europe). Investors don't like this either, because it signals that insurers and other payors are putting the thumbscrews on the company.""Payor mix obviously is very critical as well, as large, consolidated payors which cover many many lives have negotiating power and can pick/choose/rationalize products based on price, efficacy, alternatives etc.,"" Thomas Vandeventer, portfolio manager at Tocqueville Asset Management, told IBD in an email.Second-quarter earnings reports and conference call comments revealed that while some biotech giants and hot stocks relied almost solely on price increases for growth, others expanded mostly on volume increases, and still others credited a mix of both.Amgen (AMGN) was a classic example of leaning on price: Q2 revenue rose 6%, but volume growth was zero.Much of this stems from the age of Amgen's leading drugs. Its top-seller, rheumatoid-arthritis drug Enbrel, is over a decade old, and its volume shrank 2% in the quarter. But it still contributed 10% growth thanks to pricing.Two drugs that are even older, Epogen and Neupogen, shrank in both price and volume because they're facing new biosimilar competition. Newer drugs Prolia and Xgeva made up the difference by growing on both fronts. But this is one reason why, despite the fact that it beat Q2 estimates and raised guidance, Amgen stock initially dropped after the earnings report.In contrast to Amgen, Celgene's (CELG) revenue rose 22% in Q2, and 16 of those percentage points came from volume growth, according to the company. It didn't break the percentages down by individual drug like Amgen did, but the company said demand was good across the board.Celgene also beat forecasts and raised guidance for future sales and profit, and its stock jumped 3% after the report.Medivation (MDVN) demonstrates the sneaky power of rebating. The list price of prostate-cancer drug Xtandi -- for now, Medivation's only marketed drug -- rose 6% during the second quarter. But while revenue overall rose 17% -- a bit less than analysts expected -- volume grew 18%.""The growth in underlying demand for Xtandi was partially offset by a lower net price for Xtandi due to a year-over-year increase in the gross-to-net rate,"" said CFO Jennifer Jarrett on the Q2 earnings conference call, gross-to-net being industry-speak for the rebate level.Xtandi has been in a tight competition with Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Zytiga in the prostate-cancer market, and J&J has been undercutting its price. CVS Health's (CVS) recently released 2017 drug formulary passed over Xtandi for Zytiga for this reason.Following their Q2 reports, here's a rundown of how the other big biotechs are faring on the price vs. volume question:""In the United States, the lion's share from a change (on a) year-over-year basis is price, and is pretty stable unit trends on Tecfidera, pretty stable unit trends on Tysabri and modest, gradual decline on the interferon franchise (which includes Avonex and Plegridy),"" Clancy said. ""Ex-United States, we are not seeing any pricing (increases) on a year-over-year basis, and all of the gains are attributable to volume and unit expansion.""Biogen's overall revenue rose 12% in the quarter, beating expectations.Lead drug Soliris provides the vast majority of revenue, and its volume rose 15% on a 10% hike in sales. The rest of the top line came from newly launched drugs that have no year-over-year comparison.Incyte's revenue jumped 51% year over year, beating expectations.RELATED:Are Biotechs Making A Comeback: 5 Stocks To WatchBiotechs Are Making A Case For Leadership, But Is It A Good One?

141,INCY,"Incyte's (INCY) oncology program will grow on a Merck (MRK) partnership tying Keytruda and epacadostat in four ""hot"" tumors in 2017, Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt said Friday as he boosted his price target on Incyte stock.Schmidt has an outperform rating on Incyte stock and upped his price target to 131 from 115 to reflect the epacadostat opportunity. On the stock market today, Incyte stock lifted a fraction to 117.75. Earlier, shares rose as much as 1.9% and neared a 15-month high achieved Tuesday.The announcement was made Monday during the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. Merck and Incyte have tested their combo on nine types of tumors. Data in MSI-high colorectal cancer and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma are not yet available.Keytruda and epacadostat won't advance in ovarian cancer nor triple-negative breast cancer. But the duo will continue to work in melanoma, bladder, kidney, lung, head and neck cancers, according to the companies' announcement Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Donald Trump referred to the pharma industry as ""disastrous"" and accused it of ""getting away with murder."" His comments overlapped with the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, where the tone was seen as ""cautiously optimistic.""
"
142,INCY,"Schmidt is bullish on Incyte's epacadostat opportunity. Phase 3 trials with Keytruda are likely to begin later this year. Thus far, the data have been ""unambiguous"" and researchers from both companies are comfortable with moving forward.Epacadostat belongs to a class of drugs that inhibit IDO1, a gene. IDO molecules are thought to allow tumor cells to escape detection by the immune system. Researchers are testing whether inhibiting the gene could assist in battling certain cancers.Questions remain as to the extent of the partnership, Schmidt said.""It is unclear whether Merck will opt-in to co-fund the planned trials and whether a period of exclusivity will be granted to Merck before Incyte may initiate additional phase three trials in potentially overlapping indications with another PD1 inhibitor,"" he wrote in a note.Merck is also working with Eli Lilly (LLY) in combining Keytruda and the chemotherapy Alimta to treat non-small cell lung cancer. The opportunity for epacadostat is NSCLC depends on a development strategy and competition, Schmidt said.But Merck is well-positioned in the market. It will likely beat rivals Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and AstraZeneca (AZN) to the market with an immuno-oncology plus chemo treatment. Analysts note that Bristol-Myers could creep up on Merck with an IO plus IO combo.Merck stock rose a fraction Friday, rising 3.7% for the week.RELATED:Eli Lilly Rebounds On Chemo-Drug Patent Win Vs.

145,INCY,"Biotechs have a lot riding on drug data in 2017.IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group plunged 25% in 2016 after a rocky election year. Relief that Hillary Clinton lost the White House spiked the group nearly 17% in the week following the election, but those gains have since dissipated on Donald Trump's pledge to tackle rising drug prices.The group has faced challenges at its 50-day moving average since April. Meanwhile, large caps like Amgen (AMGN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are trading at 10%-15% of their no-pipeline valuations, according to RBC analyst Michael Yee. Tugging sentiment out of its 12-month low will require either M&A or strong drug data.""M&A remains a potential coiled spring catalyst if one to two companies could go into play and many large pharmas continue to be on the hunt,"" Yee wrote in a Dec. 29 research report. He sees Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIA), Incyte (INCY), Tesaro (TSRO) and BioMarin (BMRN) as possible acquisition targets.Outside M&A, Yee said, there's a ""lack of material catalysts to get the sector moving.""IBD'S TAKE: Five top biotechs ended 2016 with triple-digit gains, outplaying the broader industry. Are your biotech picks on that list? Check out IBD's Industry Themes for the deeper dive.But nearly two dozen biotech companies this year are slated to post key drug trials data in just four key arenas: drugs to treat spinal muscular atrophy, drugs to treat cystic fibrosis, PARP inhibitors to treat several types of cancers and therapies to treat lymphoma.Success could turn sentiment positive for the second, but failure could weigh on many drug stocks.Spinal muscular atrophy — which results in the wasting away of muscle and can lead to early death — will see the least new data in 2017 of the four sectors, but it also will host what Yee, in a recent research report, calls the overall drug industry's ""only new real launch"" this year.Biogen (BIIB) and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) teamed up to develop Spinraza, the brand name for nusinersen, a drug that targets a single RNA to treat the symptoms of SMA, Ionis CEO Stanley Crooke told IBD in a recent Q&A.Biogen exercised its worldwide rights to Spinraza in August. The Food and Drug Administration approved Spinraza in late December. It's the first SMA treatment to get FDA approval and Crooke said he expects Biogen to bring the drug to market early this year.He describes SMA as a ""diabolical"" disease that chemically denervates the body. It can be fatal in infants and progresses in toddlers, robbing them of the ability to walk, eat or breathe on their own. It affects the motor nerve cells in the spinal cord, according to Cure SMA.After Spinraza's launch, midcap Cytokinetics (CYTK) is expected to release the results of a phase 2 trial on CK-2127107, which it describes as a ""novel skeletal muscle troponin activator"" that could help treat SMA patients and others suffering similar degeneration.CK-2127107 differs from Spinraza in that it aims to slow the rate of calcium release from the regulatory troponin complex of fast skeletal muscle fibers. It's in two phase 2 trials, one examining SMA patients and one looking at patients with chronic lung disease, with trial results for the latter further in the future.Cytokinetics is a lightly traded small cap, but has an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 79 out of a best-possible 99. The stock crept into a buy zone in late December, hitting a 12.65 entry point out of a cup-with-handle formation, but has slipped to 10.60 as of Thursday's close, triggering the sell rule anytime a stock falls at least 8% from a buy point Shares rose 16% in 2016.A handful of cystic fibrosis trials are expected to wrap up in 2017 — but Vertex's ""triple pill"" has sparked the most analyst chatter. Both Yee and Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan say phase 2 data for VX-152 and VX-440 are likely to be available in the latter half of 2017 and another trial's results out sooner.VX-152, VX-440 and VX-661 are being investigated as a three-prong treatment for cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease that causes mucus to collect, blocking the airways and damaging the digestive system. VX-661 is in phase 3 testing with results from two patient populations expected in the first half of the year.Yee estimates VX-152, VX-440 and VX-661 could add $1 billion to $2 billion in long-term sales for Vertex. He sees ""a fairly good chance the 'triple' will work in the second half of 2017, driving the company's growth. But, he notes that investors remain wary. Vertex stock fell 41% in 2016, but it is up 9.8% this year after falling 2% to 80.91 on Thursday.Vertex is far from alone in the cystic fibrosis game. As many as seven other publicly-traded biotechs are expected to release clinical trial data in 2017. Mid-cap biotech PCT Therapeutics (PCTC) appears furthest along, with phase 3 data for its Translarna due this quarter.The PCT trial examines CF patients with nonsense mutations. According to Cystic Fibrosis News, Translarna could potentially make the cellular protein machinery run the ""so-called stop sign in the CF-causing CFTR gene, replacing it with amino acids similar enough to allow the protein to do its work.""Clovis Oncology (CLVS) pulled ahead of Tesaro in late December when the FDA granted accelerated approval to its PARP inhibitor, rupacarib. A day later, the FDA gave Tesaro's PARP inhibitor, niraparib, priority review. The two are duking it out to rival Lynparza, a PARP inhibitor approved in 2014 from AstraZeneca (AZN).Both are deadlocked in a race to treat ovarian and breast cancer. Clovis is on track to unveil phase 3 data for rupacarib — which will sell under the brand name Rubraca — in patients with a BRCA-like mutation in the latter half of 2017. BRCA mutations are often associated with breast cancer.Tesaro's niraparib is on deck for phase 3 breast cancer and phase 2 ovarian cancer data in the second half of 2017. Niraparib has a Prescription Drug Free User (PDUFA) date of June 30, according to Biopharma Catalyst's FDA tracker.Niraparib, rupacarib and olaparib (the chemical name for AstraZeneca's Lynparza) belong to a class of drugs called PARP inhibitors. Several forms of cancer are dependent on PARPs, a type of enzyme. By inhibiting those enzymes, companies like Clovis, Tesaro and AstraZeneca hope to treat several cancers.AbbVie (ABBV) and Pfizer (PFE), via its acquisition of Medivation, also are working on PARP inhibitors.AbbVie's veliparib missed several endpoints, including progression-free survival (PFS), in a phase 2 trial of recurrent and metastatic breast cancer with BRCA mutations unveiled in early December. Phase 3 testing is underway. Veliparib is also being investigated as a treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Pfizer acquired Medivation for $14 billion in September. Medivation's talazoparib is in development to treat breast cancer with germ line BRCA mutations. But neither AbbVie nor Pfizer's PARP inhibitors are expected to have data in 2017.Ariad, Kite Pharma (KITE) and Seattle Genetics (SGEN) look poised to lead 2017 in the lymphoma battle — though as many as 10 publicly-traded biotechs are expected to present data this year on varying drugs.Next month, Kite's KTE-C19 will likely come away with ""solid"" six-month durability data in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), says RBC's Yee. That could lead to a rolling Biologics License Agreement (BLA) in Q1 and a PDUFA date before year-end.KTE-C19 belongs to a class of drugs called CAR T-cell therapies. These drugs teach a patient's immune system to fight off specific cancers. Kite's drug is being investigated as a treatment for refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma.Ariad Pharma, on the other hand, already has a PDUFA date of April 29 for its brigatinib, a treatment for anaplastic lymphoma kinase positive (ALK+) metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) resistant to crizotinib, a Pfizer chemotherapy.Though the PDUFA date is in April, first-line data won't be available until 2018-19. Competitor Roche (RHHBY) has similar data for a rival drug due in that same time frame. Ariad completed the New Drug Application (NDA) for brigatinib in October.Also in 2017, Seattle Genetics is angling for a fourth indication for its 2011-approved Adcetris. Adcetris is being examined as a treatment for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). It will also unveil the results of a yearlong phase 3 trial of Adcetris and chemotherapy in front-line Hodgkin lymphoma.Seattle Genetics is trying to establish ""a redefined front-line therapy in Hodgkin lymphoma after nearly 40 years of the same therapy,"" CEO Clay Siegall told IBD in a recent interview.RELATED:Investors Siphon Biogen, Ionis Gains After Spinal Disease Drug's OKIonis Pharma Eyes Sustainable Profitability After FDA ApprovalAmgen Plans Robust 2017 In Alzheimer's, Migraines, Oncology: CEO ExclusiveBristol-Myers Won't Seek Accelerated Opdivo Lung Cancer OK

146,INCY,"Barclays analyst Geoff Meacham on Thursday said he expected Gilead Sciences' (GILD) 2017 outlook to be hindered on limited hepatitis C sales. He also sees Merck (MRK) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) issuing sluggish views, though he is more bullish on Biogen (BIIB) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).RBC Capital on Wednesday said much the same about Gilead, and also was more bullish on Biogen as well as on Amgen (AMGN).Hepatitis C drug prescriptions dipped 6%-7% quarter over quarter in Q4, according to market tracker IMS. Gilead makes Sovaldi and Harvoni to combat hepatitis C.Merck and Alexion, meanwhile, will guide to declining metrics on heavier spending and new management, respectively, Meacham predicted. ""Though we'd argue this is widely anticipated,"" Meacham said in a research report.He sees Biogen offering upside guidance on its Spinraza launch with Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS), and Johnson leveraging cost controls to offer a better 2017 view.IBD'S TAKE: As hepatitis C sales fall, where will Gilead go? Check out IBD's Industry Themes for the full scoop on how biotech's five biggest are expected to do in Q4.Ahead of the Q4 pharma earnings season, which starts next week with reports from companies such as J&J, Stryker (SYK) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), Meacham boosted his price target on Incyte (INCY) stock, noting that company's phase three tumor efforts with Merck. The duo are testing immunotherapy Keytruda and epacadostat in four tumors.Meacham expects Incyte, in its Q4 earnings conference call, to give some color on Jakafi trials in graft vs. host disease, as well as its tumor efforts with Merck. He bumped his price target on Incyte stock to 135 from 105. Incycte hasn't yet set a date for its Q4 earnings report.Incyte stock, which last week touched a 14-month high just shy of 119, rallied 2% to close at 117.53 in the stock market today.For Q4, the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expects Incyte to report $324.8 million in sales and 14 cents earnings per share, up a third and down 52%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter.Merck's spending is likely ramping on Keytruda which was granted priority review last week in combination with Eli Lilly's (LLY) chemotherapy Alimta to treat non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients with a high expression of the PDL1 gene.Keytruda-plus-Alimta is in phase three testing. If data are strong, Merck could open itself up to a larger patient population vs. the 25%-30% of patients with a 50%-plus PDL1 expression. Keytruda is already approved as a monotherapy in high-expressing PDL1 patients with NSCLC.RELATED:Merck, Biogen, Lilly Top 2016 Approvals Despite FDA SlumpTrump's 'Disastrous' Pharma View Doesn't Rattle JPMorgan Drug ConferenceWill Trump Break With Republicans And Push Major Drug Reform?

147,INCY,"Shares of Incyte (INCY) popped to a buy zone Monday after the drugmaker and partner Merck (MRK) announced they would advance their Phase 3 clinical program looking at combining an Incyte drug with a Merck therapy to treat more types of tumors.The companies said they ""plan to initiate pivotal studies"" on combining to fight non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. They are combining Incyte's epacadostat with Merck's Keytruda anti-PD-1 therapy. The two had been working together on treatments for melanoma.Keytruda is approved to treat certain types of non-small cell lung cancer, but Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) is among companies developing competing treatments for NSCLC.IBD'S TAKE: The Q4 earnings season begins in earnest next week. Which stocks are worth watching? IBD provides plenty of sources of help, including the Rising Profit Estimates list.Incyte and Merck, in their announcement, said they expect to make presentations about their latest data at upcoming medical meetings, though they didn't say just which meetings.Incyte stock jumped 9.4% in the stock market today to 118.53, touching a buy point of 110.05 out of a flat base. Shares earlier touched a 14-month high of 119.89.The stock fell 7.5% in 2016, but RBC Capital Markets recently said Incyte could be a takeover target because of the success of Jakafi, its treatment for a type of blood cancer called PV, or polycythemia vera.Merck stock rose 1.4% Monday to 61.11, regaining its 50-day moving average.

Those gains countered losses of around 0.2% for the Dow Jones industrials and the S&P 500.The Russell 2000 slipped almost 0.5%. The popular small-cap gauge lagged the Nasdaq last week with a 0.7% lift.Volume was running sharply higher on the Nasdaq as of 1:15pm ET vs. the same time on Friday and a touch higher on the NYSE.While hospital and medical services paced the field of 197 industry groups with gains of 5.1% and 3.4%, respectively, growth investors should pay attention to Incyte (INCY), a developer of tiny molecules for drug research, as the lesser known large-cap play bolted 9.2% to 118.27, good for a 52-week high, and above a 110.05 entry within a nearly eight-week flat base pattern.That flat base could also be seen as part of a long, deep bottoming base pattern in which Incyte dropped from a multiyear high of 133.62 to a low of 55 set in February 2016.The company can show choppy fundamentals, and the Wilmington, Del., firm lost money each year from 1999 to 2014.On a quarterly basis, Incyte's Q4 profit is seen falling 52% to 14 cents a share. That followed four quarters in a row of solid earnings. However, on an annual basis, Wall Street sees earnings ramping up to 62 cents a share in 2016, up from 3 cents in 2015, and rocketing 126% to $1.40 a share in 2017.Amgen (AMGN) was a huge winner in the early 1990s thanks to its success in developing therapies to treat anemia in cancer patients. Amgen shares, up more than 7% last week in heavy turnover, added nearly 1% to 158. The megacap with a market value of $117 billion is trying to form a new base, and shares are up 0.9% to 158.13 in the stock market today.Incyte said on Monday it's teaming up with Big Pharma play Merck (MRK) to develop new therapies to treat a variety of diseases, including non-small cell lung, bladder, renal and head and neck cancers.Incyte has a $22.3 billion market cap and 188 million shares outstanding. It came public in November 1993.Eye care expert Glaukos (GKOS), based in Laguna Hills, Calif., rolled more than 6% higher to 38.27.Volume is running nearly quadruple its 50-day average of 477,000 shares as the small-cap medical leader approaches its 39.82 all-time high.The pioneer of an minimally invasive treatment for the serious eye disease glaucoma was added to IBD Leaderboard as a potential market leader on Friday as it broke out past a 36.10 buy point within a three-month cup with handle.While Glaukos sports just a 79 EPS Rating, it's a relative young public company, having debuted in June 2015. Plus, analysts see outstanding profit growth in 2017 with earnings re-estimated to rise 83% to 22 cents a share.RELATED:What Is The Bottoming Base Pattern, And How It Helps Investors Make MoneyThe Bottoming Base Pattern, Part II: Why Apple Formed One In 2009How To Invest: Wall Street Trading Tips From A Stock Market MasterIBD Technology News: Incyte, Merck Move Forward In Phase 3 Clinical Trials

151,INCY,"Tuesday marked a shiny rally for small-cap equities while big- and megacap firms sat in the back seat. Meanwhile, money continued to flow in certain tech and commodity sectors of the market.While the largest tech firm trading in the market, Apple (AAPL), showed decent but not outstanding action following Monday's breakout from a base-on-base pattern, other companies showed more oomph.The company with a $635 billion market cap — just shy of Switzerland's estimated nominal GDP in 2016 — edged up for a fourth day in a row, up 0.1% to 119.11 and 1% past a new 118.12 entry point. Volume fell. On Monday's breakout, turnover edged up 7% above its 50-day average of 31.3 million shares.The S&P 500 wasted a small intraday gain of roughly 0.4% to end practically flat on Tuesday, and the Dow Jones industrials sank nearly 0.2%, the Russell 2000 thrust ahead 1% and finished almost at session highs.The Nasdaq composite found happy ground in the middle, rising nearly 0.4%. Reflecting a dominance among the bunch of stocks in the $300 million to $3 billion market-cap range, the Nasdaq 100 trailed the Nasdaq composite by rising just 0.2%.Volume fell on the Nasdaq and rose on the NYSE vs. Monday's levels, thus handing the S&P 500 a rare stalling day, or bout of heavy institutional selling. However, Tuesday's volume on the NYSE was likely below average. Read more about the major indexes' action in today's The Big Picture column.Returning to individual equities,  Incyte (INCY), beaming from its new plans with Big Pharma business partner Merck (MRK) to advance clinical trials for new cancer treatments, rose nearly 0.7% to 119.30, getting extended further from a 110.05 entry.As noted in IBD's Stock Market Today coverage on Monday, Incyte's huge gap up that day means investors with real conviction in the small-molecule development expert could have bought at Monday's opening price of 113.55, which would have been within the 5% chase zone from the 110.05 precise buy point.Illumina (ILMN), after rising nearly 17% to 165.04 in the heaviest volume in three months, may be poised to develop a bottoming-base pattern. The San Diego-based maker of human genome analysis systems, a former big winner from its April 2013 breakout to its summer 2015 peak, grew revenue by 19% in 2015, but the top-line increases decelerated in 2016.The Street also sees full-year earnings flattening for 2016, but then picking up 10% to $3.66 a share in 2017.Illumina sports a solid 91 EPS Rating for now, according to IBD Stock Checkup. However, Q4 profit is expected to fall 1% to 80 cents a share, and that would most likely depress the EPS Rating.Illumina's 52 RS Rating is typical for stocks in bottoming bases.Chinese web companies flourished, led by big gains by Alibaba (BABA) (up 2% to 96.75) and NetEase (NTES) (up 2.2% to 239.98). Both large-cap plays have risen back above their key 50-day moving averages, one key step to completing new bases.Watch Alibaba closely, as the e-commerce titan has unveiled an interesting new plan to link small businesses in the U.S. with China's gigantic and still growing middle consumer class. Alibaba has also now joined Leaderboard as a new name to watch.Baidu (BIDU), the No. 1 search engine in China, jumped nearly 2% to 180.31 and is basing.Returning to Apple, the iPhone juggernaut is still in buy range after rising past a 118.12 cup-with-handle buy point. The 5% chase zone extends up to 124.03. As noted in this Sept. 14, 2016, Stock Market Today column, Apple rallied nearly 8% after clearing a cup with handle at 110.33; that cup was part of a long, deep bottoming base pattern.At 119.11, Apple still lies 11% below an all-time peak of 134.54. The latest weekly cup shows two down weeks in heavy volume vs. two up weeks in above-average volume. However, one of those weeks saw a minimal decline and thus bespeaks strong institutional support.An Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B (track it via IBD Stock Checkup) and improved RS Rating of 63 also point to net accumulation by funds.Apple's RS line continues to drift mildly higher, signifying that it's still outperforming the S&P 500 for now.Metals firms advanced sharply.

152,INCY,"The Nasdaq composite closed at another all-time high Monday, helped by strength in semiconductor and biotech stocks.The Nasdaq finished 0.2% higher, while the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 lost 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively.The Dow was weighed down by weakness in Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX), which fell 1.65% and 0.9%, respectively. U.S. crude futures fell 3.8% to settle at $51.96 a barrel. Baker Hughes (BHI) on Friday said that U.S. drillers added rigs for the 10th-straight week, to the highest level in a year.In M&A news, VCA (WOOF) soared 28% on news it's being acquired by Mars for just over $9 billion. Elsewhere, Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIA) jumped 73% after Japan-based Takeda announced plans to buy the biotech for just over $5 billion.In the stock market today, several biotechs were in the headlines after the JPMorgan Health Care conference got underway in San Francisco. Shares of Incyte (INCY) vaulted 9% on news of a partnership with Merck (MRK). Incyte blasted out of flat base with a 110.05 buy point. Because Incyte gapped up in price, the open price of 113.55 is also a valid entry.Glaukos (GKOS) followed through after Friday's breakout, rising 5.7%. It's slightly extended from a 36.10 handle buy point.IBD'S TAKE: Glaukos is a top performer, but its Composite Rating of 74 ranks it 14th in the Medical-Products group. See who the leaders in the group are with IBD Stock Checkup.HealthEquity (HQY) was a top gainer in the IBD 50, rising 6% to 42.96. It's holding nicely above the 50-day moving average as it works on a flat base with a 45.10 entry. The company is well positioned for continued growth as Americans turn to health savings accounts to fund out-of-pocket medical expenses.In the chip space, Applied Materials (AMAT) was a top gainer in the Nasdaq 100, up 2.3%. The stock has been holding above the 50-day moving average after a breakout over a 31.17 buy point. After today's move, it's slightly extended in price now.Meanwhile, after paying a visit to the 100 price level, Nvidia (NVDA) firmed up, rising 4% to 107.28.

153,INCY,"Drugmaker Eli Lilly (LLY) will likely add a rheumatoid arthritis drug to its FDA-approved repertoire this month, says Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan, who also predicts a court decision on Lilly's chemo drug Alimta ""any day now.""The Prescription Drug Free User Act (PDUFA) date for Lilly's baricitinib is set for January. The drug belongs to a class of meds called JAK (Janus kinase) inhibitors. Eli Lilly submitted its New Drug Application, or NDA, last January for moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis.Lilly gained worldwide rights to Incyte's (INCY) baricitinib in 2009. Now, Baricitinib competes against tofacitinib, a JAK inhibitor developed by Pfizer (PFE) and the National Institutes of Health marketed as Xeljanz and Jakvinus.Incyte is also codeveloping ruxolitinib, a JAK inhibitor targeting myelofibrosis, with Novartis (NVS).IBD'S TAKE: President-elect Donald Trump caused a flurry in drug stocks late last year when he pledged to cut down on spiraling drug prices. Will he made good on that promise?Other catalysts in January include separate patent rulings in the cases of Lilly's Alimta and also for Teva Pharmaceuticals' (TEVA) copaxone, an immunosuppressant for patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.Also in January, AstraZeneca (AZN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) are likely to have some key trial data, Divan said.AstraZeneca is studying durvalumab, which has a breakthrough designation in treating patients with a specific type of urothelial bladder cancer. Bristol-Myers is looking at nivolumab to treat patients with non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).At the close on the stock market today, IBD's 43-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group, which includes Lilly, Bristol-Myers and AstraZeneca, finished the day up nearly 1%. Lilly stock, though, ticked up just 0.2% to 74.72.RELATEDLilly Spikes On 2017 Guidance; Clawing Back From Alzheimer's Drug FlopBiogen Underplays Promising Alzheimer's Data On Seizure WorriesEli Lilly Continues Alzheimer's Push After Flop; Biogen Extends Rise

154,INCY,"Major averages reversed higher after a soft start Wednesday, as the release of the minutes from the mid-June Federal Reserve meeting came and went without much fanfare.Biotechs like Celgene (CELG) and Incyte (INCY) buoyed the Nasdaq 100. Facebook (FB) also outperformed. Facebook rose 2.4% to 116.70, closing above its 50-day line for the first time since June 10.After falling 0.8% early, the Nasdaq ended with a gain of 0.8%. The S&P 500 added 0.5%, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.4%. Preliminary data showed NYSE and Nasdaq volume coming in slightly higher than Tuesday's levels. Advancing stocks outnumbered decliners on both exchanges by less than 2-to-1.Dow leaders included Merck (MRK), Home Depot (HD) and Cisco Systems (CSCO). Merck rose 2%, Home Depot 1.7% and Cisco 1.4%.After touching an intraday low of $45.92 a barrel, benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude oil added nearly 2% to $47.43 a barrel. The 10-year Treasury yield was mostly unchanged, around 1.37%.The minutes from the June 15 Fed meeting were released at 2 p.m. ET. Before the Brexit vote, the Fed had signaled a couple of rate hikes before the end of the year, but that all changed after the U.K. decided to exit the European Union. Currently, futures traders see little chance of a rate hike this year. The 10-year Treasury yield was recently at 1.39%, up 2 basis points, after hitting an all-time low Tuesday.In the stock market today, Edwards Lifesciences (EW) was a strong performer in the IBD 5o screen of leading growth stocks. Edwards Lifesciences reclaimed its 50-day moving average, rising nearly 4% in above-average volume. Homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI) also did well, rising 3% in strong turnover.

156,INCY,"Big pharma Eli Lilly (LLY) issued mixed first-quarter earnings and guidance Tuesday, sending its stock down in early trading.Lilly's earnings, excluding one-time items, shrank 5% from the year-earlier quarter to 83 cents a share, missing analysts' consensus by 2 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 5% to $4.87 billion, beating consensus by $45 million.Lilly added 5 cents to its 2016 EPS guidance range, now $2.68 to $2.78. It also raised its sales guidance slightly to $20.6 billion to $21.1 billion. At the same time, it shaved a percentage point off its gross-margin guidance, now 76%, as it also lifted its guidance for R&D and sales, general and administrative spending.Lilly stock was down nearly 2% in morning trading on the stock market today, below 77.Improved foreign-exchange rates were responsible for much of the upside, along with a 5-cent-a-share tax benefit in Q1. At the same time, the bottom line was hit by rising R&D expenses, including a $55 million milestone payment to biotech partner Incyte (INCY) upon the submission for approval of their jointly developed drug baricitinib.On the level of individual products, diabetes drug Humalog provided the biggest surprise, with its $606 million in Q1 sales falling 11% from the prior year and missing consensus by $100 million, according to Evercore ISI. Lilly said demand for the drug had actually increased, but so had rebates and discounts that Lilly negotiated with payers. Lilly said it does not expect the downtrend to continue the rest of the year.Revenue from a newer diabetes drug, Jardiance, doubled compared with last year, though since Lilly splits the take with partner Boehringer Ingelheim, it only received $38 million in Q1. U.S. sales beat expectations, and Lilly said it's taking more share of the growing SGLT2 class of diabetes drugs, perhaps accounting for the underperformance of Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) SGLT2 drug Invokana, as shown in J&J's Q1 report last week.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez wrote that while there were various upsides and downsides to the report, ""we expect a limited impact as investor concerns about a significant Q1 miss diminish, and the focus shifts to abemaciclib data at ASCO (the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in June) and the conclusion of Expedition 3 (trial of solanezumab in Alzheimer's disease) in Q4 2016,"" he wrote in his research note.

157,INCY,"Biotech stocks fell into one of the deepest craters in their history, starting last summer, but rumblings of a recovery are sounding.After a three-year bull run that more than quadrupled its value by its peak last July, IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech Industry Group plunged 50% by early February, hurt by backlashes against high drug prices and mergers that seek to lower corporate taxes.But the group has gained 12% since its Feb. 11 low, and some leading stocks have done better than that.3 Biotech Stocks Buoyed By Potential Blockbuster DrugsBioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) is up 30% from its Feb. 9 low. Incyte (INCY) has gained 29% from its low point that same week, while Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) has climbed 45%, and Medivation (MDVN), boosted by buyout talk, is up 127%.The group was up by even more before taking some hits over the past two weeks on negative earnings news from several industry players. But fund managers tell IBD the rebound is here.Why? For one, they say, the spate of bad news has already been factored into stock prices. But more than that, they see a climate favoring rejuvenated M&A, hot drugs in the new-product pipeline and pricing power for innovate products.Bottom line: The positive factors that drove the runup never went away, they say. They just got drowned out by the noise.""A very key point is that this group is a very high-beta group -- particularly the small- to midcap stocks. Since they don't have sales, they don't have earnings,"" said Tom Vandeventer, portfolio manager at Tocqueville Asset Management.""The history of this group is that elevated macro uncertainty definitely hits (it),"" Vandeventer said. ""My own opinion is this group trades more on sentiment than on fundamentals during those time periods.""Vandeventer points to troubles in China as emblematic of the macroeconomic concerns that hit biotech stocks.Another sentiment-driving factor is politics.Many of the candidates in the U.S. presidential race have bashed drugmakers for high prices and have proposed ways to clamp down. Wall Street has dismissed some of these ideas as impossible or ineffective. What seems to be generating the most concern are Democrats' proposals to let Medicare and Medicaid negotiate drug prices, which they are not allowed to do now.Already the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services has shown its teeth. It announced a pilot program changing the reimbursement for Medicare Part B, which covers drugs administered in hospitals and clinics. The Part B reimbursement scheme was long criticized for encouraging use of expensive drugs because it reimburses health care providers for the entire cost of a drug, plus 6% on top. The proposed scheme would reduce that premium and add a flat fee unrelated to the price of the drug. That, in theory, could encourage doctors to choose cheaper options.On the M&A front, the Treasury Department last month issued new guidelines on tax-inversion deals that derailed what would have been the drug industry's biggest-ever merger, between Pfizer (PFE) and Allergan (AGN). Tax inversions have become a popular way for drugmakers to boost their bottom lines and get access to cash. Allergan, after earlier mergers, is based in Ireland, which has low taxes.""We think that with the tax regulation -- I call this the 'inversion bottom' -- and the bad press associated with the health care industry, that created a bottom in our minds,"" said Robert Bombace, senior portfolio manager at Frost Investment Advisors. ""A lot of the bad news has already been baked into these companies.""In fact, a number of industry insiders say the breakup of the Pfizer-Allergan merger could turn out to be good for biotech stocks because it makes them acquisition targets for the two companies. Allergan has a long history of acquisitiveness, and Pfizer is thinking of splitting its innovative drug business from its other products. Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum says Pfizer will want to bulk up its innovative business to make it valuable as a standalone, since its pipeline is modest compared to its big-pharma competitors.Schoenebaum has also said, though, that biotech boards are balking at buyout offers. They can't accept how much their valuations have dropped, so they've been unwilling to sell at market prices. He suspects this will lead to hostile takeover deals if the big players are willing to do them. This partly came to fruition in late April, when Sanofi (SNY) made an unsolicited $9.3 billion bid for Medivation, as rumors swirled that AstraZeneca (AZN) and Pfizer were also interested.Medivation's response reflected the attitude that Schoenebaum spoke of -- that the market was underpricing the stock.""Sanofi's opportunistically timed proposal, which comes during a period of significant market dislocation, and before several important near-term events for the company, is designed to seize for Sanofi value that rightly belongs to our stockholders,"" Medivation founder and CEO David Hung said in a statement rejecting the offer.Bombace, however, says the biotechs' reluctance might be for show.""I think that's just a bargaining chip,"" he said. ""The reality is that most of these companies will have to partner up anyway. ... The larger pharma and biotech names ... will reach a point where their pipelines are so dry, it will force their hands.""Bombace sees lots of exciting biotechnology science going on to fill out those pipelines. As he put it, we're ""going from the Model T stage to the space-shuttle stage.""Though he declined to name specific companies, he pointed to work in biomarkers -- which include PD-1 inhibitors such as Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Opdivo and Merck's (MRK) Keytruda. He also cited work in genetic mutations, the focus of many rare-disease firms such as BioMarin and Bluebird Bio (BLUE).These discoveries are keeping money flowing into and out of biotechnology, says Leonard Yaffe, who manages a health care hedge fund at Kessef Capital Management. He told IBD that specialty drugs -- the largely biologic drugs prescribed by specialists, as opposed to primary-care doctors -- contributed only 1% of prescriptions last year but 37% of dollars spent on drugs, up from 25% two years earlier.""One thing I think will drive the biotech stocks is that, if you look at drugs introduced in the last two years, 65% of the revenue derived from those drugs are from biologicals,"" Yaffe said. ""So it's the most attractive sector in the pharmaceutical area.""Also, while most publicly traded biotech stocks don't have earnings, those that have successfully launched drugs remain highly profitable. Of the top five biotechs in market cap -- Gilead Sciences (GILD), Amgen (AMGN), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB), and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) -- four have IBD EPS Ranks ranging from 89 to 96, putting them in the top 11% of all stocks in EPS growth. Regeneron has a 68 EPS Rank.Those numbers, however, reflect the pricing power of biologic drugs, which is precisely what's under political attack these days. Vandeventer says price uncertainty is the biggest risk to his bull thesis on the group right now. But he also points out that Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton attempted a previous overhaul of the health care system back in the mid-1990s, which depressed drug stocks in the short term but was followed by the late-1990s boom.That boom was driven by the first wave of biotech innovation, when companies like Amgen and Roche's (RHHBY) Genentech proved that biotechnology could produce blockbusters. Vandeventer says that innovation will remain the key in maintaining pricing power, even under political pressure. He points to Gilead's portfolio of hepatitis C drugs, which started in late 2013 with the launch of Sovaldi. Despite much political criticism of Sovaldi's high price, no one could stop it because the drug was so superior to anything else on the market.""Companies that have done the research -- they'll continue to get price increases,"" he said. ""Companies that are particularly in the rare-disease, orphan-disease arena, (or) the oncology space -- companies that have drugs in an era of targeted medicine that have higher efficacy rather than a shotgun trying to hit a disease -- are going to have pricing power.""The promise of such drugs can still make small stocks explode. Celator Pharmaceuticals (CPXX) has surged to over 13 from under 3 since March on favorable late-stage trial results for its acute myeloid leukemia treatment. The company also saw a hedge fund take a position in the stock and attracted favorable initial coverage from an analyst.There are signs that even generalist investors think biotech stocks have gotten cheap, says Yaffe. During the first quarter, a common lament was that every biotech stock got punished for bad news, but good news got no reward. But when Biogen issued a mixed earnings report that drew mostly negative reactions from Wall Street on April 21, its stock rose more than 5%.Biogen had fallen even harder than other big-cap biotechs, dropping 50% from its March 2015 high to its Feb. 12 low, so it was ready for a bounce, says Yaffe.""The overview comment is the sector had corrected 30%, and at some point it gets to the level where the stocks are very attractive,"" he said.

158,INCY,"A drug candidate that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) jointly developed has beaten AbbVie's (ABBV) best-selling rheumatoid-arthritis (RA) drug in a late-stage study, the companies said Friday.Regeneron and Sanofi said that their monoclonal antibody sarilumab met the trial's main goal of improving symptoms after 24 weeks of a biweekly dosing regimen. Some 72% of patients on sarilumab achieved at least a 20% improvement in signs and symptoms based on American College of Rheumatology criteria, in contrast to 58% of the patients in the Humira group. Both groups experienced about the same rate of negative side effects, though the sarilumab group showed a higher rate of neutropenia, or lowering of white blood cells.Humira is currently the top-selling RA drug and, indeed, the top-selling drug of any kind in the world today, but its number of competitors is rising. Last fall baricitinib, a drug that Eli Lilly (LLY) and Incyte (INCY) co-developed, also beat Humira in a head-to-head trial; unlike the injectable Humira and sarilumab, it is delivered orally. Roche's (RHHBY) intravenous medicine Actemra has also bested Humira in trials.Regeneron and Sanofi have already applied for FDA approval of sarilumab based on earlier data, with a decision due by Oct. 30.RBC Capital Markets analyst Adnan Butt called the news a ""modest positive"" but added that investors are still concerned with some nearer-term issues with Regeneron's stock. Among them is a pilot program to test changes in Medicare Part B, announced this week, that could affect a great deal of the reimbursement for Regeneron's flagship drug Eylea, and a patent lawsuit that Amgen (AMGN) filed over another monoclonal antibody in the Regeneron/Sanofi partnership, Praluent.""All else being equal, beating Humira is certainly better than not beating it, but at least some of the discussed overhangs may need clearing before the pipeline receives more credit,"" wrote Butt in a research note.By late morning on the stock market today, AbbVie stock was up almost 3% near 58. Sanofi was up 2% near 41, while Regeneron stock was up a fraction near 381.

159,INCY,"During the drug-stock boom, the newer biotech companies tended to get the most play as growth stocks. But last year, one of the top-performing large-cap drugmakers was none other than 140-year-old Eli Lilly.Like other big pharmas, Lilly (LLY) has spent the last few years climbing out of an earnings trough brought on by the loss of patent protection on some of its biggest drugs. While growth is still slow, investors have gotten ever more interested in the company's pipeline:Lilly's late-stage drug candidate solanezumab could bring a breakthrough in a currently untreatable disease -- Alzheimer's.Psoriasis treatment ixekizumab is expected to launch anytime now and eventually achieve blockbuster sales. Another immunology drug, baricitinib, which Lilly co-developed with Incyte (INCY), was also recently filed with the FDA.Meanwhile, the already marketed diabetes drug Jardiance shocked Wall Street last year by reducing deaths from heart failure by 32% in a large-scale study called Empa-Reg.Recently, Lilly CEO John Lechleiter sat down with IBD to explain Lilly's strategy for 2016 and beyond.IBD: I'm interested in your immunology strategy. Given that there are a lot of medicines out there in that area, how do you see yourself fitting into the space?Lechleiter: Well, I think the only way we can enter that space -- and lay claim to any of these disease areas -- is to offer something better. And I believe the data we have on ixekizumab, which is our anti-IL17 antibody for psoriasis, is excellent. You look at clearance rates: 31% to 41% of people across three studies had 100% clearance of their plaque. So while there are competitors there, we feel very good about the profile of that product.I think with baricitinib, in four studies we established, in one of them superiority to methotrexate, which is the current first-line standard of care; and in another study, superiority in terms of signs and symptoms of RA (rheumatoid arthritis) to (AbbVie's (ABBV)) Humira, which is the biggest drug in the world.I think we’re bringing something new to these categories. In the case of RA, we know people cycle between different courses of therapy, and I think there’s no question, even with the drugs we have in that space today, there’s still an unmet need.IBD: In the diabetes area, you have this impressive data from Jardiance, and people are wondering is this going to be a class effect? If it is, do you have a point of differentiation?Lechleiter: Well, I think first of all, the people (who are) asking if it’s a class effect (meaning the entire class of drugs would all perform the same) are the people who don’t have Jardiance. The fact is, we have the data. Anything else about any of the other ones is speculation. So I think the advantage we have is first-mover advantage. Obviously, as soon as we get the label changed, we will exercise that. We filed that with the FDA ... (and) expect to get updated labeling reflecting the outcome of Empa-Reg later this year.IBD: The overall diabetes market has been under pressure lately. Sanofi (SNY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) have been warning of slower growth. Is this true of the market in general or just certain segments?Lechleiter: I think that several categories are still growing in the diabetes space. It’s very competitive. Each of these drug categories has three or four different players. We happen to be the only company that has a complete spectrum across the treatment paradigm, along with Boehringer Ingelheim.The growth of insulins is slowing a bit, because we believe that more and more people using insulin are using an sglt2 inhibitor like Jardiance that are lowering insulin requirements. So I think there’s some interplay between the drugs. But we also know that SGLT2 category growth is coming at the expense, in many cases, of generic sulfonylureas. So that brand category is expanding.I think from a market standpoint, there’s a lot of competition. That’s great for consumers (and) great for physicians. But it remains for us to differentiate our products and to compete in that mix.IBD: Building the complete portfolio of diabetes medicines -- what is the advantage of that? Is it a marketing advantage?Lechleiter: Well, at a fundamental level, we can work with physicians to address, “What’s the right drug for a given patient?” vs. “How do you fit the patient into our drug?” if that makes sense. Let’s understand, diabetes is a progressive disease. So understanding where the patient is in that journey, and how our medicines can best help the patient. We can be agnostic about what choice a physician makes, because we have an offering at every step of the way.Ultimately, we can also, hopefully, better understand what the right combinations are. We have a fixed-dose combination of a DPP4 along with Jardiance -- we’re the only company that offers that today. We have not just orals, we have insulins. We have not just insulins, but our GLP-1 drug Trulicity. So I think there’s some advantages in terms of being able to optimize treatment. And ultimately there may be some marketplace advantages to having a full basket of products -- if you think about negotiating with payers and insurers, for example.IBD: In Alzheimer’s, you have different programs going. Do you anticipate there will be multiple drugs in this category?Lechleiter: First of all, if solanezumab is positive -- we’ll know by the end of the year -- that’s going to generate a tremendous amount of interest in companies developing BACE inhibitors, antibodies and other drugs. We believe that ultimately this will probably be treated with a combination, not unlike the way diabetes is treated today, not unlike the way cancer is treated. It may be an antibody with an oral BACE inhibitor, for example. But we’re also developing agents that act against tau (protein), which is a downstream aspect of the disease progression.It remains to be seen, but our best guess is that it will be a combination. If (solanezumab) is successful, others will follow, and we aim to be in that group.IBD: In oncology, again I’m thinking about your positioning -- there's been lot of drug industry activity in cancer. Can you talk about your strategy?Lechleiter: The pillar of our oncology business, going back eight or nine years ago, was Alimta, and it still is today. We bought ImClone in October of 2008. We’ve had two drugs approved from that ImClone pipeine: Cyramza, which now has four indications -- two gastric cancers, colorectal cancer and lung cancer -- and then late last year we got approval for Portrazza, and that’s indicated for squamous-cell non-small-cell lung cancer. And that’s a type of lung cancer that, in the first line, has not seen an improvement in survival for 20 years. So we’re excited about that.We have a third ImClone product that we’ve commenced filing with the FDA, called olaratumab. That is for soft-tissue sarcoma. Behind that we have three drugs in the clinic today that have immune-system components associated with them, as we begin to build an immuno-oncology portfolio. We also have a drug that I think everyone is excited about called abemaciclib. That’s a CDK4/6 inhibitor. We’ll have the phase-two data for breast cancer this year. We also have a phase-three (trial) underway. We also have a phase-three underway for our CDK4/6 inhibitor in lung cancer.So we’re focused on immuno-oncology, microenvironment -- which would be Cyramza, in other words anti-angiogenesis drugs -- and cell cycle inhibitors. So it’s a three-pronged approach, and I think we’ve got a good portfolio of products in the pipeline to address all three.

161,INCY,"Biotech Incyte (INCY) tumbled to a 15-month low Thursday after it ended a trial of its lead drug in pancreatic cancer, though its Q4 earnings beat Wall Street estimates.Incyte said that it's ending a phase-three trial of its drug Jakafi, or ruxolitinib, along with capecitabine (also known as Roche's (RHHBY) Xeloda) as a second-line treatment for advanced metastatic pancreatic cancer, after an interim analysis showed that it would be futile.Jakafi is sold for the blood cancers myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera, but Incyte is studying it in various solid tumors. It will discontinue several other trials based on the same hypothesis as the pancreatic cancer trial, including midstage trials in lung, breast and colorectal cancer. However, it will continue solid-tumor trials combined with other agents, including Merck's (MRK) Keytruda (pembrolizumab) and AstraZeneca's (AZN) Tagrisso (osimertinib).Incyte also said that its Q4 revenue, which came from a combination of Jakafi sales, royalties and contract revenue, jumped 97% over the year-earlier quarter to $243.9 million. That's about $18 million above analysts' consensus, according to Thomson Reuters. Net income was 29 cents a share, reversing a year-earlier loss and soundly beating consensus of 9 cents.The company did not offer revenue or EPS guidance for this year but said that Jakafi sales should be $800 million to $815 million, up from $601 million last year. It forecast R&D expenses of $620 million to $640 million, plus selling, general and administrative expenses of $255 million to $270 million.Incyte stock was near 56, down nearly 23% in morning trading on the stock market today.

163,INCY,"SAN FRANCISCO — Less than an hour after President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the drug industry as ""disastrous,"" Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) CEO Randall Schatzman classified the tone at the 35th annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference as ""cautiously optimistic.""That's a wide departure from the 2016 event. At that time, he said, sentiment was decidedly pessimistic as the U.S. entered what turned out to be a raucous election year. The drug-pricing debate is alive, but biotech sentiment is growing stronger this year, Schatzman told IBD in an interview at the conference, one of the drug industry's major events, held this week in San Francisco.""Talking about the biotech industry as a whole, I think it's finally come to maturity,"" he said. ""Over the last two years, almost 70 drugs have been approved that have come from innovation in biotechnology, not large pharma. So the dollars there are really paying us back, and we're seeing some real game-changers.""Among those, Schatzman included Alder's anti-CGRP migraine drug, which competes directly with similar meds from Eli Lilly (LLY), Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Amgen (AMGN). The migraine market is big enough that all four could grab a sizable share when their drugs hit shelves, likely in 2019.But he acknowledges Trump's comments didn't help stock prices. Holding his phone, Schatzman pulled up a screen of biotech stocks, red arrows indicating their descent. To that point, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (IBB) (an exchange-traded fund) fell 3% Wednesday. It rose a fraction both Thursday and Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Trump's commentary sent drug stocks into a tailspin on Wednesday. Get the deep dive on what it means for your drug and biotech picks on IBD's Industry Themes.So any rally Wall Street expected from the JPMorgan event didn't unfold. But here are five key takeaways investors could note for 2017 as Trump takes office, drug firms look to sidestep Lilly's Alzheimer's flop and M&A gets an early start.Trump isn't alone in his fixation on drug prices. Celgene (CELG) CEO Mark Alles parried back when a reporter questioned whether the No. 3 biotech would follow in Allergan's (AGN) footsteps, applying a so-called ""social contract"" to not raise prices more than 10% annually.Celgene has offered free access programs for years, Alles said, estimating the No. 3 biotech gives away 6% of its drugs each year for free. Drug-prices increases help fund R&D for new drugs, he added. CFO Peter Kellogg estimates Celgene reinvests 35% of its funds into R&D, when accounting for partnerships.Alles says Celgene goes through a ""thoughtful process,"" accounting for innovation and spending to bring a drug to market before it prices a new med. Schatzman used the same words to describe Alder's plan to price out its anti-CGRP drug, once it nears FDA approval and heads to market.But HealthPrize Technologies CEO Tom Kottler called pricing spikes the easy way out for drug companies. HealthPrize is a software-as-a-service firm that marries behavioral economics and consumer marketing to analyze and improve patient adherence to prescriptions.Pharma leaves about $637 billion in worldwide revenue on the table each year by not pushing patients to take their meds, Kottler told IBD. To bridge the gap, companies can bring new products to market, prompt doctors to write more prescriptions or raise prices. Typically, they choose the latter.They're missing out on easy money, Kottler says. But raising prices ""is the easiest thing for them,"" he said.Drugmaker Merck (MRK) announced its immuno-oncology (IO) drug Keytruda in combination with chemo — Eli Lilly's Alimta — had won priority review from the FDA in non-small cell lung cancer and has a Prescription Drug Free User Act (PDUFA) date of May 10.Meanwhile, Merck and Incyte (INCY) are moving Keytruda and epacadostat into phase 3 trials of four tumor types (non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck). Incyte stock jumped 9.4% Jan. 9 on the news.But Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) is on Merck's tail, analysts say. Bristol-Myers is testing a combination of Opdivo and Yervoy, both IO therapies, in NSCLC. Analysts expect the Bristol-Myers readout in the first half of 2018. IO combos are likely to be more effective and durable than IO plus chemo, some say.On Monday, Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical put down a $24 per share bid on Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIAD), an oncology firm based in Massachusetts. Ariad stock flew 73% on the news, helping shares of oncology firm Tesaro (TSRO) lift 3.7%.Tesaro stock and four IPOs led IBD's 420-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group in 2016, with each of those stocks seeing triple-digit gains. Tesaro jumped 157%, where the group overall fell 24% amid the painful election cycle.Now, analysts wonder if Tesaro's success and an oncology-minded atmosphere — reiterated by Takeda's offer on Ariad — could garner a bid for Tesaro. Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez sees a potential takeout price of $170 per share of Tesaro stock, which closed Friday at 156.41 after rising 6.4%.""While Tesaro remains well positioned to grow independently, a validated PARP inhibitor like niraparib (an ovarian cancer drug still in development) could offer a durable and strategically important product opportunity for multiple suitors,"" Fernandez wrote in a research report Jan. 9.Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) are asking a federal judge to stay a ban on their LDL-busting drug, Praluent, in the aftermath of a patent battle that landed in a win for No. 1 biotech Amgen. Praluent infringes on Amgen's patent for PCSK9 inhibitor Repatha, the judge said.Meanwhile, an LDL-buster from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) and The Medicines Co. (MDCO) is slowly advancing. On Jan. 9, The Medicines Co. announced a 180-day interim analysis from a study examining PCSK9si inclisiran. The data showed inclisiran significantly lowered LDL up to day 210.RBC analyst Adnan Butt expects six-month data to be similar on efficacy and safety. Details are expected during the 2017 American College of Cardiology conference in March in Washington, D.C. Inclisiran should do well on strong data despite the patent litigation for Amgen and Regeneron/Sanofi.""Inclisiran is differentiated and has no patent litigation overhang,"" Butt said in a research report Wednesday.Axovant (AXON) CEO Vivek Ramaswamy says the biotech and drug industry has ""utterly failed"" in Alzheimer's. Oncology, inflammation, cardiology — they've all seen significant advancements in the last 10 years. Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and dementia, including those with lewy bodies, haven't, he says.""If we don't find a treatment, it's a major threat to society,"" he told IBD in an interview Wednesday. ""This is the single area in health care we have failed to deliver a major advancement in, in the last decade.""Ramaswamy says he was rooting for Eli Lilly in December. But Lilly's highly-lauded solanezumab failed to meet its primary endpoints in a late-stage trial, causing Lilly stock to plunge 10.5% the day of that announcement. Lilly's drug and a drug in development by Biogen (BIIB) work to remove plaque buildups in the brain associated with Alzheimer's.But that's a ""silver bullet"" theory, and Ramaswamy doesn't buy it. Instead, he sees it necessary to treat the various behavioral, psychological and neurological pieces of Alzheimer's and dementia. Axovant is aiming to build new therapies on top of older ones.Axovant is next is the Alzheimer's field to deliver a readout. Data are slated for Q3, he said. Ramaswamy is looking for just one major piece of news in Alzheimer's advancement. Says Ramaswamy, ""A rising tide will lift all boats.""

167,INCY,"Hematologists and oncologists like Incyte's (INCY) opportunity in polycythemia vera (PV) and see the biotech's growing Jakafi sales landing it a potential takeover deal, RBC analyst Simos Simeonidis said Sunday.But on the stock market today, Incyte stock fell 2.2% to 100.79. Shares are down about 7% for the year, though have traded above their 50-day moving average since early November. Incyte stock is creating a flat base with a 110.05 entry point.Simeonidis kept his outperform rating on Inctye stock after a call with three key opinion leaders in the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) market. All three were positive on the use of Jakafi in PV, which is a blood cancer, and expect its use to increase.IBD'S TAKE: PV isn't the only strong contender on the market for 2017. Regeneron could make a sweet buck on eczema drug sales, RBC says. How sweet? Check out IBD's Industry Themes for the full scoop.Jakafi belongs to a class of drugs called JAK (Janus kinase) inhibitors. Inhibiting the action of this family of enzymes has shown to help treat certain cancers and inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. Gilead Sciences (GILD) and CTI BioPharma also are working on JAK inhibitors.Incyte is teamed up with Novartis (NVS) on Jakafi, which Novartis commercializes and sells outside the U.S. as Jakavi.Wall Street generally sees Incyte in the lead on JAK inhibitors, but Jakafi competes against chemotherapies like Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) hydroxyurea and Roche's (RHHBY) interferon, Pegasys, in the PV market, Simeonidis wrote in a research report. Jakafi is typically a second-line drug.About 25%-33% of PV patients are intolerant to or resistant to hydroxyurea, providing another upside to Jakafi sales, the doctors said. All three expect use of Jakafi in PV to increase in the coming year and going forward. One noted the median Jakafi benefit in PV is longer than in myelofibrosis.But European and American physicians differ when it comes to prescribing a JAK inhibitor in place of more traditional chemo or interferon, one physician said.""EU docs are more likely to treat patients based on European Leukemia Net (ELN) criteria while in the U.S. physicians are more likely to treat 'based on their gut,' i.e., has the patient been on hydroxyurea 'long enough' or experiencing side effects,"" one doctor told Simeonidis.RELATED:Gilead Could Scoop Up Incyte After Cancer Drug Proves 'Not Good Enough'Incyte Recoups Losses After Price-Fixing Fracas On Strong Chemo Results

169,INCY,"The stock price of biotech CTI BioPharma (CTIC) fell to pennies Wednesday after the company said late Tuesday that it had withdrawn its FDA application for pacritinib, a blood-cancer drug that it was developing in partnership with Baxalta (BXLT).CTI and Baxalta had filed for approval of pacritinib for myelofibrosis on Jan. 5, but clinical trials of the drug were still underway. On Monday, CTI said that the FDA had placed a partial clinical hold after it had seen ""excess mortality and other adverse events in pacritinib-treated patients compared to the control arm"" in one of the trials, according to a press release. On Tuesday, CTI said the FDA had placed a full clinical hold on the trials, inducing the companies to withdraw the application and ""decide next steps.""The application covered a fairly narrow range of patients -- specifically those with intermediate and high-risk myelofibrosis with low platelet counts of less than 50,000 per microliter. However, it did present some potential competition to Incyte's (INCY) Jakafi, both in its target and in its class, as both drugs are Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors.""While we didn't view CTI/Baxalta's pacritinib as a significant threat to Incyte's Jakafi franchise in myelofibrosis, we think the unfortunate and surprising setback of a potential competitor should remove a small overhang on Incyte shares,"" wrote Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt in a research note.Incyte stock was up 3% in early afternoon trading on the stock market today, near 74. CTI BioPharma, already beaten down by Monday's news, was off 40% to 30 cents.Baxalta was up about 2%, perhaps because its future acquirer, Shire (SHPG), received an unrelated upgrade from RBC Capital Markets. Analyst Douglas Miehm lifted his rating to outperform from sector perform, writing that the competitive threat to Baxalta's hemophilia portfolio has been more than accounted for in Shire's 42% drop in share price since last August.Shire stock also was up about 2%, near 154, early Wednesday afternoon.Image provided by Shutterstock.

172,INCY,"2015 was a year with two distinct parts for drug stocks: The first seven months continued the bull run of the last four years, while the sudden resurfacing of the drug-pricing debate led to a rocky five months after that.But overall, the group came out ahead — and these top-performing big caps show that a solid story can make up for political worries in the eyes of investors.•Incyte (INCY) is up 49% — as of Wednesday's close — after a year of steady gains for its lone marketed product, Jakafi, as well as its pipeline of potential blockbusters. In March, Jakafi won EU approval in the blood cancer polycythemia vera, for which it is already approved in the U.S., along with another blood cancer, myelofibrosis. Both those diseases are rare, but Incyte is shooting for much bigger markets with its late-stage candidates baricitinib and epacadostat.Baricitinib, which Incyte is developing in partnership with Eli Lilly (LLY), tested successfully in phase-three trials in rheumatoid arthritis against a placebo, methotrexate and the current market leader, AbbVie 's (ABBV) Humira. In his Nov. 18 initiation report on Incyte, Goldman Sachs analyst Salveen Richter estimated peak annual sales of more than $2 billion after an expected 2017 launch.Richter added that a more important future driver of shares will likely be Incyte's entries into the budding field of immuno-oncology. Incyte has been testing its lead candidate in the field, epacadostat, in combination with Merck's (MRK) Keytruda in a variety of cancers. In early November, Incyte's stock fell after a small study of the combo in patients with advanced cancers disappointed Wall Street, but Richter wrote that 2016 will likely bring more clarity as more results come out.Incyte has been operating at a loss due to all this research spending, but analysts expect it to turn its first annual profit next year. The stock's current IBD Composite Rating is 60.•Danish diabetes giant Novo Nordisk (NVO) is up 39% as it ends the year with a flat base following early gains. In March, the stock rose sharply after Novo said it would refile for U.S. approval of its long-acting insulin analogue Tresiba, along with its shorter-acting sister drug Ryzodeg. The two drugs suffered a surprise rejection in 2013 as the FDA sought more data on their possible risks to the heart. This time around, the agency was convinced, and it approved them on Sept. 25.Also boosting the stock early in the year was Novo's February release of positive clinical-trial data on its latest glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, OG217SC. Novo has been selling its earlier GLP-1 agonist Victoza since 2010, but the market has gotten more competitive in the last couple years with new GLP-1s launching from Sanofi (SNY), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Eli Lilly. Those drugs are all injectable, however, while Novo's new candidate is oral. Novo announced further positive results for the drug in July and September.Novo's financial results in U.S. currency suffered from the foreign-exchange headwinds that hit all global drugmakers this year, but it still managed a solid IBD EPS Rank of 85 and a Relative Strength rating of 87.•Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) continued its multiyear run on the stock market, hitting a lifetime high of 605.93 on Aug. 4 before getting caught in the larger biotech sell-off. It's still up 34% for the year.Regeneron's flagship eye drug Eylea continued to perform well, aided by a new approval for diabetic retinopathy in March. But drawing more attention was the launch of its cholesterol drug Praluent in July.Praluent was not only the first of a new class of cholesterol drugs — though it was followed shortly to the market by Amgen 's (AMGN) Repatha — it's also the first of a number of novel monoclonal antibodies that Regeneron has been developing in a partnership with Sanofi. The next entry, dupilumab, is in late-stage testing for asthma and eczema and is also expected to attain multibillion-dollar annual sales.Regeneron is also the highest-rated stock on this list, with the highest-possible Composite Rating of 99.• Eli Lilly is the top-performing traditional big pharma of the year, with a 25% gain. While its sales growth has been flat due to its aging drugs, as well as currency headwinds, the company has improved profit margins through cost controls and gotten a lot of investors excited about its pipeline. As noted above, its partnership with Incyte has borne fruit in the baricitinib trials. Lilly doesn't have much of a presence in rheumatoid arthritis or other immunology diseases, but Lilly is planning to change that not only with baricitinib but with ixekizumab, a psoriasis treatment it's planning to launch next year that is expected to sell in the billions eventually.Lilly's already-launched diabetes drug Jardiance yielded one of pharma's biggest upside surprises this year, when a giant study of its effects on cardiovascular health showed that it reduced death from heart failure by 32%. That drove the stock to a 14-year high of 92.85 in September, which turned into a cup-with-handle base.The stock holds a 72 CR.• Baxalta (BXLT) is up 23% since it started trading July 1 in a spin-off from Baxter International (BAX), which sought to unlock the shareholder value of its biopharma arm. Just 10 days later, the company received an unsolicited $30 billion buyout offer from British drugmaker Shire (SHPG), which saw Baxalta's hemophilia franchise as an ideal addition to its rare-disease portfolio.Baxalta rejected the offer, but the situation remains unresolved. Last week, rumors were buzzing that Shire would up its bid, though it hasn't yet. Baxalta's financials have been slow and steady, leading to an EPS Rank of 62, but the acquisition hopes have lifted the stock's RS Rating to 94.

173,INCY,"Big pharmas Merck (MRK), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) were trading up Tuesday after getting upgrades from Barclays, while AbbVie (ABBV) seesawed on a downgrade.Analyst Geoff Meacham assumed coverage of a newly combined U.S. Pharmaceuticals sector in Barclays' coverage, and while he left most ratings the same he made a few tweaks. Lilly was upgraded to overweight from equal weight, and its price target lifted to 95 from 75, based on the promising pipeline and management's commitment to lowering expenses. Meacham said that Lilly could be building a ""major autoimmune disease franchise"" with its late-stage drug candidates ixekizumab (for psoriasis) and baricitinib, a rheumatoid-arthritis drug it's developing with Incyte (INCY).""Based on the solid Phase 3 data, we view baricitinib as having significant market share potential in rheumatoid arthritis,"" Meacham wrote. ""Our model conservatively projects 2025 risk-adjusted sales of $1.2 billion vs. peak sales of $1.5 billion for (Pfizer 's (PFE) Xeljanz.""Meacham called diabetes drug Jardiance Lilly's ""most important commercial asset over the intermediate term"" since its recent study results showed it sharply reduced deaths from heart failure . He admitted that this has been an overhang for Merck, as it derives a lot of its revenue from competing drug Jardiance, but argued that the stock has overreacted.""While we acknowledge there are multiple headwinds and risks that make Merck a 'show me' story, we think even under most potential negative scenarios that there is too much underlying value to ignore,"" Meacham wrote as he raised Merck's rating to overweight from equal weight and hiked its price target to 66 from 65. ""Even if pipeline assets aren't blockbusters, they add up and are nearly free at the current valuation.""Lilly stock was up almost 5% near 86 in afternoon trading on the stock market today, while Merck stock was up 2% near 54.Meacham also raised J&J to overweight from equal weight, with the price target rising $14 to 155. As with Merck, he felt that the market is undervaluing J&J.""J&J has underperformed the S&P 500 and DRG over the past 12 months due to concerns about the impact of biosimilars on Remicade, low near-term earnings growth, and a lack of significant near-term pipeline catalysts,"" Meacham wrote. ""This has led to calls to break up the conglomerate, but we believe this to be premature.""In Meacham's view, J&J would be better off acquiring growth assets, especially in pharma.J&J stock was up 1% in afternoon trading, near 102.Meanwhile Meacham downgraded AbbVie to equal weight from overweight and trimmed the price target to 72 from 73. Like many analysts, he thought that AbbVie's projections for recently acquired blood-cancer drug Imbruvica and similar drugs in the pipeline — some $20 billion a year at peak — are too high.""Imbruvica and other oncology assets likely to succeed, but the field is highly competitive,"" Meacham wrote.AbbVie stock initially dropped almost 2% in Tuesday's trading, but by afternoon was up about 1.5% near 59.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook.

174,INCY,"The managers of $2.1 billion Columbia Mid Cap Growth Fund spun their wheels a bit in a difficult third quarter, but have kept their mutual fund on course. After outperforming the broad stock market and peer group tracked by Morningstar in the first and second quarters, the mutual fund lagged its peers in Q3. Some of that underperformance came from holdings in the energy sector.To cope, the fund has cut its energy weighting. It also saw energy holdings lose value. Its energy weighting of 1.56% as of Sept. 30 was more than 5 percentage points lower than a year earlier.In the case of trims, proceeds were recycled into stocks where the managers see better risk-reward opportunities for investors, says lead manager George Myers. ""We invest in growth companies, but we aren't willing to overpay,"" Myers said.The approach has worked long-term as well as recently. The fund's 7.09% gain this year going into Tuesday topped 94% of its peers. The S&P 500 was up 3.27%.The fund carries a B+ 36-month Performance Rating from IBD, having performed among the top 20% of all mutual funds in that period.One stock they added to in Q3 was Signature Bank (SBNY), which is on IBD's Leaderboard. ""We like this bank because, unlike big bank competitors, they offer customers a single point of contact,"" Myers said. ""You don't get passed from one person to another. And the bank continues to take market share.""Myers said the bank's pay package attracts talented employees, who bring their books of business.And Signature stands to benefit from any Federal Reserve interest rate hike.All-Weather StocksThe fund aims for growth stocks that are able to grow earnings no matter where we are in an economic cycle. To do that, a company needs a unique or at least superior product or service.""For example, higher interest rates won't impact people's need to buy products from Incyte (INCY), the oncology (and rheumatoid arthritis) company,"" Myers said.The managers like the prospects for Incyte to build on revenue from new products in addition to its cancer treatment Jakafi. It is working to develop a cancer immunotherapy. And Myers says tests have been promising for a rheumatoid arthritis drug it is developing in a partnership with Eli Lilly (LLY).""We think Incyte's product is superior to (AbbVie (ABBV)'s) Humira, which sells for north of $15 billion globally,"" he said.LinkedIn (LNKD) is another stock that the managers like. ""Our long-term thesis is that the talent solution segment, which is 60% of the business, will be better than people expect,"" said co-manager Brian Neigut. ""The marketing solution segment, which was under pressure in 2015, will also continue to do better than Wall Street expects based on new product updates and ancillary products.""Roper Technologies (ROP) is another favorite that the fund shifted money into. Co-manager William Chamberlain likes the company's knack for making accretive acquisitions such as legal software firm Aderant, in October. He also likes its wide variety of products.Chamberlain calls Roper an industrial firm that he increasingly thinks of as a tech stock.Ultimate Software Group (ULTI) is another fund favorite. The company benefits from an ongoing shift of payroll services to the cloud. ""In 2016 we expect accelerating revenue growth, which will set them apart from many other tech companies, Myers said.

175,INCY,"Goldman Sachs analyst Salveen Richter launched coverage on a group of smid-cap biotech stocks Wednesday, rating the sector as neutral but flagging four stocks as worthy of investor attention. Here are his top picks: Bluebird Bio (BLUE): Richter gave this young biotech a buy rating at a price target of 165, a whopping 107% premium over Tuesday's closing price. Bluebird stock suffered a setback earlier this month when its gene-therapy treatment LentiGlobin missed investors' sky-high hopes in beta thalassemia and sickle-cell disease. But the setback just made for a more attractive entry point for Richter.""Bluebird is also developing Lenti-D, a gene therapy for the rare fatal neurological disease childhood cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CCALD), with interim pivotal data expected in 2016,"" Richter noted in his report. ""Beta-thalassemia and CCALD appear somewhat priced in (peak $1 billion and $176 million sales in 2026, respectively), but the sickle cell disease opportunity is upside to current levels (peak $3 billion sales).""Bluebird stock rose 6.3% on the stock market today, to 85.59. BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN): While Goldman Sachs is transferring coverage of this rare-disease specialist from Richter to fellow analyst Terence Flynn, Richter included it in his report with a price target of 158, a 47% premium on Tuesday's close. The analysts noted a ""slew of catalysts"" coming up for BioMarin, including next week's FDA advisory committee meeting on Kyndrisa (drisapersen), the treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy that the company acquired last year. Approval of this drug is highly uncertain, given the lack of previously approved drugs for the disease as well as the fact that Kyndrisa technically failed its most recent clinical trial.""We believe the event is likely to be positive, based on data totality (including new analyses), BioMarin's ability to explain the limitations of the failed phase three study (with two controlled phase two trials having shown benefit), the unmet need of the disease, precedent of prior approvals and strong lobbying efforts from patient advocacy groups,"" said the report.BioMarin stock rose a fraction Wednesday, to 107.70. Kite Pharma (KITE): Richter assigned this stock a 39% upside by giving it a price target of 111. He pegged the American Society of Hematology (ASH) conference in early December — where Kite is scheduled to present midstage trial data on KTE-C19, its chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy for blood cancer — as the major near-term catalyst for this stock.""Focus will be on whether Kite can reproduce prior efficacy/safety data in its ongoing pivotal study, having brought manufacturing in-house, and in the competitive landscape,"" Richter wrote. ""In 2016, we expect KTE-C19 interim data in (the second half) to support a regulatory filing by year-end 2016.""Richter added that next year should also bring early-stage data on several other programs for glioblastoma (malignant brain tumor), cervical cancer and head-and-neck cancer.Kite stock rose 8.7% Wednesday, to 86.85. Incyte (INCY): Richter gave this stock a price target of 135 and a 19% upside, calling it ""(the) best-positioned biotech immuno-oncology (IO) company for 2016.""""The lead drug, Jakafi, is on track for $2 billion in U.S. sales (Novartis (NVS) partnership ex-U.S.), and we expect revenue stream diversification with baricitinib (Lilly (LLY) partnership) with market entry in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) likely in late '16/early '17,"" Richter wrote. ""Incyte shares could see more inflection points with 1) initial data from three phase-one/-two combination studies of IDO (Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) PD-1, AstraZeneca's (AZN) PD-L1 and Roche's (RHHBY) PD-L1), likely through first half of 2016 and at ASCO (Jun 3-6, 2015), and 2) decisions to advance IDO combinations into pivotal testing in non-small-cell lung cancer ($1.9 billion peak sales), based on data that will become available 'in house' to Incyte and its collaborators.""

176,INCY,"Big pharma Eli Lilly (LLY) and its biotech partner Incyte (INCY) said Wednesday that their rheumatoid-arthritis drug outperformed AbbVie's (ABBV) market-leading Humira in a clinical trial, sending both stocks higher.
"
177,INCY,"The study's primary endpoint for the drug baricitinib was simply to do better than the placebo as measured on the ACR20 test, which signifies at least a 20% improvement in symptoms. But the drug also outperformed Humira, both on the ARC20 and Disease Activity Score 28 tests after 12 weeks of treatment, and after 24 weeks beat Humira in a measure of joint damage. Lilly and Incyte did not give exact numbers but said detailed data will come in future medical meetings and publications.
"
178,INCY,"This was the fourth successful late-stage clinical trial for the drug, which is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, a class including Incyte's already marketed cancer drug Jakafi, as well as Pfizer's (PFE) rheumatoid-arthritis drug Xeljanz. Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum noted that the history of Xeljanz provides some reason for caution.
"
179,INCY,"""On efficacy, these results are positive for baricitinib, but we think these efficacy results were consistent with data from Pfizer's JAK inhibitor Xeljanz at the high (unapproved) dose of 10 mg twice daily and thus largely expected. (Xeljanz 10 mg twice daily was not approved due to questions about the risk-benefit profile at that dose.) On safety in the trial, the press release reports that serious adverse events for baricitinib were similar to placebo although lower for Humira,"" Schoenebaum wrote in an email to clients. ""Therefore, although interested in the detailed efficacy data, we are particularly interested in the detailed safety data from the trial and also long-term safety, which we believe would be a major driver of uptake for chronic therapy in RA.""
"
180,INCY,"AbbVie's Humira is one of the world's best-selling drugs, pulling in some $12.5 billion last year, while Xeljanz, launched in 2013, has yet to crack $1 billion mark, even though it has the advantage of being a pill while Humira has to be injected.

187,INCY,"U.S. stock indexes booked solid gains Wednesday afternoon, but biomed stocks dived on President-elect Donald Trump's vow to bring down drug prices.The Nasdaq advanced 0.7%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average gained 1% and 1.4%, respectively. The small cap Russell 2000 rose 0.5%. Volume in the stock market today was running higher on both major exchanges.Medical stocks struggled after Trump said in a Time Magazine interview that he doesn't like ""what's happened with drug prices"" and would bring down prices. Trump made no mention of investment in research and development, which is never free. Companies such as Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) put 40% of revenue into research and development, while Big Cap 20 stock Incyte (INCY) put 63% of revenue into R&D last year. Without strong growth in revenue and profits, R&D budgets would shrink, and the odds of developing new drugs would also fade.High-end biomeds, which rely the most on R&D, led the retreat Wednesday with the group down about 4%.Meanwhile, for the rest of the market it was business as usual.Bank stocks, which have led the Trump rally, were little changed. The exchange-traded fund PowerShares KBW Bank (KBWB) inched up 0.7% to 47.05. The bank ETF has gained about 21% since its Election Day close.Steel has been another area of strength in the stock market and that continued Wednesday afternoon. Gainers among steel producers included United States Steel (X), up 5.4%; AK Steel (AKS), up 3.7%; and Nucor (NUE), up 1.7%. Steel alloy stocks also showed strength. Carpenter Technology (CRS) popped 4.5% as it retook its 50-day line. Allegheny Technologies (ATI) rose 1% as it tried to clear a base.In economic news, the Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey was little changed in October. Layoffs slipped, but so did the rate of hiring. The job openings gauge is one that Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen watches closely. CME Group's FedWatch Tool was unchanged Wednesday with a 94.9% chance of an interest rate hike in December.RELATED:Trump Targets Drug Prices, Apple, Seeks '5 Minutes' With Offshoring Firms10 Chip Stocks Get Buy RatingsSouthwest Air, Delta Break Out Of Bases

188,INCY,"U.S. stocks were mostly flat in afternoon trade Friday, as big-money investors apparently decided to skip out early for the three-day weekend.The Nasdaq added almost 0.1%, but the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average were flat. Volume in the stock market today was running sharply lower on both major exchanges. The market will be closed Monday in a nod to Christmas. Trade will resume Tuesday.In the IBD 50, a list of top-rated stocks in fundamentals and technicals, most stocks were up. Four stocks posted gains of 1% or more: savings and loan BofI Holding (BOFI), up 2%; chip designer Nvidia (NVDA), 1%; health savings account provider HealthEquity (HQY), 1%; and cloud-based communications and storage provider J2 Global (JCOM), 1%.Savings and loans and chip stocks are leading sectors in the current stock market. Meanwhile, HealthEquity is expected to benefit from a repeal of ObamaCare. HealthEquity surged 12% the day after the presidential election, en route to a 44% gain in the so-called Trump rally, before stepping back to a 31% gain.On the weekly chart, HealthEquity is consolidating. The stock is above its 50-day line and could form a flat base.Hospitals, an industry group benefiting from ObamaCare, lost as much as 16% after the election before trimming the loss to 7%. Under ObamaCare, hospitals are able to shift at least some of the costs of caring for nonpaying patients onto the government.Biotech stocks, a group that could suffer if President-elect Trump follows through on his threat to knock down drug prices, were the top-performing industry group Friday, up 2%. The worst performer of the day was stock in foreign banks.Incyte (INCY) popped 1% in slow turnover. The biotech is consolidating within a flat base.Blue chip stocks were not moving much Friday, and the day's losers in the Dow only narrowly outnumbered gainers.In the S&P 500, gold miner Newmont Mining (NEM) was one of the day's better performers.

189,INCY,"Gilead Sciences' (GILD) latest cancer drug is ""not good enough,"" RBC analyst Michael Yee said Thursday, suggesting the No. 2 biotech would be better off buying midcap rival Incyte (INCY) for its stronger myelofibrosis drug.Late Wednesday, Gilead unveiled mixed results for two phase 3 trials of momelotinib, a JAK inhibitor. Janus kinase (JAK) is a family of enzymes. Drugmakers believe blocking these enzymes could treat certain cancers and inflammatory diseases.Among JAK inhibitors, Incyte leads the pack as Gilead, the No. 2 biotech by market cap, looks to unseat the incumbent. In a head-to-head phase 3 trial, Gilead's momelotinib wasn't inferior to Jakafi by week 24 in terms of splenic response. But it missed in terms of total symptom score.In a second phase 3 trial, momelotinib was pitted against the best available therapy in patients previously treated with Jakafi. Momelotinib didn't prove to be superior to other therapies, but did meet on the total symptom score endpoint.Gilead stock slipped 0.55% to 75.58 on the stock market today, while Incyte stock rose 4.8%, to 105.55, on Gilead's mixed results. IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group rose nearly 1%.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs look poised for a takeoff on Donald Trump's election, but what would an appeal of the Affordable Care Act do to the industry? Check out IBD's Industry Themes for some ideas.RBC's Yee suggests Gilead could push to acquire Incyte and its stronger JAK inhibitor. Gilead looks unlikely to file for momelotinib in Q1, as previously planned, Evercore analyst John Scotti wrote in a research report. Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young doesn't see momelotinib as a competitor to Jakafi.""Even if momelotinib makes it to market, we don't expect this drug to be meaningful competitor to Jakafi,"" she wrote in a report. ""We are uncertain if there is a regulatory pathway due to the mixed results and a drug on market that has a robust set of data already.""Gilead wrapped Q3 with $31.6 billion in cash, equivalents and market securities on its balance sheet. It also has a history of acquiring innovation including Nimbus Apollo for its nonalcoholic steatohepatitis assets and Galapagos NV for anti-inflammatory drug.The firm is typically a patient acquirer, Credit Suisse's Young says. And investors know it.""For investors, we think that these challenges heighten the focus on external M&A,"" she wrote. ""However, we know Gilead and they will be disciplined and patient acquirers of assets so we don't know if these challenges really change their sense of urgency.""Yee expects Gilead to make a play for Incyte to bolster its limited-view pipeline. Any bid would likely follow phase 3 data from Incyte on its lung cancer drug. He expects Gilead to make a string of cancer acquisitions over the next few years.""We don't see many companies over $10 billion to $20 billion that would fit well, so we believe they should do a string-of-pearls to buy five-plus companies over next one to two years,"" he wrote. ""Gilead hadn't done much outside of three NASH deals, and they are patient in cancer.""RELATED:Drug Stocks Rally On Relief Clinton Didn't Win White HouseCan This Small-Cap Biotech Take On Gilead, Celgene, Biogen In Alzheimer's?Biotechs Climb For Third Straight Day; Which Leaders Are Buyable?

But on Nov. 23 itself, the group actually rebounded to the plus side after first falling.""Investors are trying to look at things with a more glass-half-full optimism,"" RBC analysts wrote in a research report ahead of the ASH conference. "" ... there are buyers looking to accumulate biotech given where we've come from over the past year.""IBD'S TAKE: Celgene is ranked fourth in IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group with a Composite Rating of 97, meaning it performs in the top 3% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. It also checks in at No. 44 on the IBD 50 ranking of top-performing stocks. Get the Stock Checkup for your best bets in biotech.RBC likes Celgene, Kite, Spark, Prothena (PRTA), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Seattle Genetics (SGEN). Evercore analyst John Scotti is keeping track of CAR T-cell therapies from Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Kite, and combination data from Celgene.Celgene is expected to unveil phase-three data on Revlimid in post-stem-cell-transplant multiple-myeloma patients. The expanded use could drive an additional $500 million to $1 billion in annual revenue and help Revlimid become the standard of care, RBC says.Celgene stock dropped 3% by the closing bell on the stock market today, to 118.51, after touching a one-year high of 127 on Nov. 9. IBD's 422-company Biomed/Biotech group was down 2.5% at the close Wednesday, and it's fallen 3.9% since Lilly's Alzheimer's trial announcement.Evercore's Scotti looks for Celgene to discuss early clinical data on a next-generation drugs using the chemical cereblon. CC-122 is aimed at diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and CC-220 could treat sarcoidosis — growths of inflammatory cells on different body parts.In other areas, Celgene has partnered with Acceleron Pharma (XLRN) on luspatercept for anemia in patients with rare blood disorders and Agios Pharma (AGIO) for AG-221, which could treat mutated proteins that are tied to certain cancers. Scotti expects updates on those partnerships.Both look for CAR T-cell data from Kite in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, after Juno last week placed its JCAR15 trial on clinical hold following the deaths of two patients. Kite also has phase-two DLBCL data. Previous data show 80% and 76% overall response rates in transplant and chemo relapsed patients.This ""will likely support a broad label assuming in presentation the CR (complete response) remains strong,"" RBC analysts wrote. Six-month durability data is also important, but that won't be available until Q1, they noted.Other key reports include amyloidosis data from Prothena, hemophilia data from Spark, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) data from Alexion, graft vs. host data from Incyte (INCY) and Hodgkin lymphoma data from Seattle Genetics, RBC wrote.RELATED:Kite Pharma Soars As Cancer Drug Trial Supportive of FDA ApprovalEli Lilly's Alzheimer's Drug Fails Key Trial; Lilly, Biogen DiveAmgen, Biogen, Celgene Eye M&A In Trump's 'Pro-Biotech' World

In the stock market today, Incyte stock rose 5.2% to 87.57, earlier rising as much as 7.1%. The biotechs and generic-drugs groups rose more than 2% and more than 3%, respectively.Incyte's most recent study pooled data from two five-year phase-three studies of Jakafi. The median overall survival (OS) for those who started with Jakafi was 63.5 months. Patients who crossed over from the placebo or from what was the best available therapy (BAT) at the time, saw a median OS of 45.9 months.Correcting for patients crossing over to Jakafi, the control group saw a median OS of 27 months.IBD'S TAKE: Inctye stock is about 10% below a 92.92 buy point achieved Sept. 28 out of a consolidation area, where a decline of 8% triggers the sell rule. Use IBD's stock lists to keep an eye on Stocks Near A Buy Zone.""Thus, these results further support the survival benefit of Jakafi treatment in myelofibrosis (MF), and suggest that earlier initiation of treatment with Jakafi may provide a greater survival advantage for patients with MF,"" RBC analyst Simos Simeonidis wrote in a research report.Simeonidis reiterated an outperform rating on Inctye stock. Incyte will present the full results of its Jakafi abstract on Dec. 4 during the American Society of Hematology annual meeting.Incyte's positive Jakafi data follows its strong Q3 earnings report early Tuesday. Sales grew 44% year over year to $269.5 million and 19 cents earnings per share minus items swung from a 22-cent loss in the year-earlier quarter.Both metrics topped the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $261.4 million and a 1-cent loss. Incyte's Q3 beat followed rival Novartis' (NVS) Q3 sales miss last week, which prompted the stock to drop 5.8% over the following two days.RELATED:Align, Incyte, GrubHub Among Best R&D Stock Plays: GoldmanIncyte Could Stoke M&A Fire On 'Deep And Durable' Melanoma Drug ResultsBioMarin, Incyte, Kite Get Thumbs Up On Goldman Sachs Upgrade

192,INCY,"Drug giant Eli Lilly (LLY) is poised for a jolly December, if data and rulings come in positive.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan says all eyes are on new data for Eli Lilly's Solanezumab, an Alzheimer's disease drug that he predicts has a 60% probability of success. Legal decisions and regulatory rulings surrounding Lilly's Jardiance, Alimta and Trulicity also are expected next month.Eli Lilly stock could use a year-end bounce. Shares are down about 10% this year, falling 0.82% to 76.01 on the stock market today. IBD's 44-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group fell more than 1% Tuesday.Phase 3 data from Lilly's Sola is due ""any day now and definitely by year-end,"" Divan wrote in a research report Tuesday. Sola could act as a neuroprotector for patients with Alzheimer's. Its success could boost rival Biogen (BIIB), which has a similar drug in development.Divan predicts Lilly stock could soar more than 20% if Sola shows significant functional benefit, 10% if it shows a trend on function and 5% even if it shows no functional benefit. He predicts a 10%-15% drop if Sola misses on cognition.IBD'S TAKE: December could be jolly for more than just Eli Lilly. Drug stocks have rallied since the election of Donald Trump, who is seen as more business friendly than Hillary Clinton. But what happens if Trump makes good on his promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act? The outlook isn't as certain. Grab IBD's Industry Themes for a deeper dive.In addition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is due to make a decision in December on whether to expand the label on Jardiance, a type 2 diabetes med. The risk is ""skewed to the downside"" as most observers are expecting FDA approval, Divan said.Also, patent litigation is ongoing for Lilly's Alimta, a chemotherapy for cancer in or near the lungs. But most expect the patent to expire in 2021-22, regardless, Divan noted.Also, in coming weeks Lilly is due to release an interim analysis of a study on type 2 diabetes drug Trulicity.But the news flow won't end there. Initial 2017 guidance is expected Jan. 4 and the FDA could approve baricitinib, a rheumatoid arthritis drug in conjunction with Incyte (INCY), by mid-January, he wrote.Baricitinib belongs to a class of drugs called JAK inhibitors. Gilead Sciences (GILD) is working on a JAK inhibitor, as is AbbVie (ABBV). Pfizer (PFE)has one approved and is currently in trials to expand its use. Incyte also has a JAK inhibitor on the market. Janus kinase (JAK) is a family of enzymes. Drugmakers believe blocking these enzymes could treat certain cancers and inflammatory diseases.Editor's Note: Corrects last graph on which companies are working on a JAK inhibitor or already have one on the market.RELATED:Gilead Could Scoop Up Incyte After Cancer Drug Proves 'Not Good Enough'Amgen, Gilead, Eli Lilly Eat Into AbbVie's Humira Sales: Analyst

193,INCY,"Spending on research and development has leveled off as companies increase stock buybacks and dividends, says Goldman Sachs, but some companies do better than others in getting the most bang for their R&D buck.In a new research report, Goldman names companies that it says are ""best positioned to make their R&D dollars work.""Making that list are: Align Technology (ALGN,) Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), GrubHub (GRUB), Incyte (INCY), Universal Display (OLED), Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN).Meanwhile, Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet, Amazon and drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) lead the way in total R&D spending. Goldman Sachs, though, also analyzed R&D intensity (measured as percentage of sales) and other metrics.Since 2005, ""Regeneron, Salesforce.com (CRM), Apple (AAPL), Amazon and Netflix (NFLX) have experienced outsized growth when it comes to gross profit and R&D, as well as price returns over the same period,"" said the Goldman report.IBD'S TAKE: Of Goldman Sach's R&D favorites, Palo Alto Networks belongs to the IBD 50, where you can learn about many growth stocks. GrubHub sports a highest-possible Composite Rating of 99, while Align Technology has a CR of 97. Composite Ratings are part of CAN SLIM Investing.""R&D's share of the total spend pie has been pretty stable since 2010, suggesting that corporations have likely been in maintenance mode with their R&D spend as opposed to being in expansion mode,"" said the report.Tech companies lead in R&D spending, followed by the health care, consumer discretionary and industrials sectors, says Goldman.RELATED:Do You Tend To Buy Stocks Too Late?

194,INCY,"Novartis (NVS) stock tumbled to a six-month low Tuesday after the firm's Q3 sales missed views, but double-digit growth in chemotherapy sales could buoy ex-partner Incyte (INCY), said RBC analyst Simos Simeonidis.In the stock market today, however, both Novartis and Incyte stocks toppled, with shares of Incyte testing their 50-day moving average. Novartis stock fell 3.7% to 72.63, with Incyte stock dipped 1.1% to 87.20.For Q3, Novartis reported $12.13 billion in sales and $1.23 earnings per share ex items, down 1% and 3%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Sales missed the consensus of six analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $12.23 billion. EPS topped by 4 cents.But sales of chemotherapy drug Jakavi/Jakafi, used to treat myelofibrosis, MF, and polycythemia vera, PV, grew 45% year over year to $149 million, topping consensus views for $147 million, Simeonidis wrote in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: The biotech sector has been slogged recently, but double-digit gains last month from Kite Pharma and G.W. Pharmaceuticals could breathe some life back into the sector. Get a closer look using the Industry Snapshot.Incyte acquired the rights to develop and commercialize Jakafi for graft-vs.-host disease from Eli Lilly (LLY) in April. Lilly also amended its agreement with Novartis to allow Novartis the right to do so outside the U.S. in exchange for royalty payments.Simeonidis estimates Incyte will pull in $28.4 million in Q3 royalties from Novartis, up 57% vs. the year-earlier quarter. That missed Simeonidis' earlier view for $29.1 million and the consensus model for $29.7 million.""According to Novartis, the increased revenue came from patient gains in MF globally and the launch of PV in key markets,"" he wrote. Inctye's actual royalties likely will be reported Nov. 1 within Inctye's Q3 earnings release.As for Novartis, the firm reiterated his full-year guidance, and expects 2016 sales to be in line with last year's at $49.4 billion.RELATED:Merck Crushes Q3 Expectations Following Lung Cancer Drug WinEli Lilly Q3 Revenue, EPS Miss; CEO Praises Drug Pipeline

195,INCY,"Stocks rallied to big gains heading into the lunch hour Wednesday, as the market continued to digest President-elect Donald Trump's surprise victory.The Dow Jones industrial average ran ahead 1%, the S&P 500 rose 0.7% and the Nasdaq added 0.6%. Volume was higher across the board vs. the same time Tuesday. The Dow futures had plunged as much as 800 points Wednesday night.Steel, medical and drug stocks led the upside in the stock market today, while hospitals, solar and automakers underperformed. West Texas intermediate crude prices rose 2% to $45.87 a barrel; gold futures were up 0.7% to $1,287 an ounce.Merck (MRK), Pfizer (PFE) and Caterpillar (CAT) were the top gainers on the Dow, rallying north of 6% each.Apple (AAPL) was down 1.3%, but had pared its loss from nearly 3%. The stock is still below its 50-day moving average, which it breached Nov. 1. It's just shy of a 110.33 cup-with-handle buy point first cleared Sept. 14. The iPhone maker, as well as other tech companies including Microsoft (MSFT) and Cisco Systems (CSCO), could benefit from Donald Trump's cash repatriation proposal, if Congress permits. Cisco was up 1.3%; Microsoft was fractionally lower.Biotechs, which had been targeted by presidential candidate Hillary Clinton over high pricing, jumped 7%.Amphastar Pharmaceuticals (AMPH) soared 16%, surging past its 50-day line in triple average trade. Shares are now well extended past a 17.90 cup-with-handle buy point initially cleared Aug. 9. The injectable drugmaker on Tuesday reported Q3 adjusted earnings of 14 cents a share, topping views and reversing a loss from the same year-ago quarter.Among other biotechs, Celgene (CELG) held a 9% gain after earlier spiking as much as 17% to a 52-week high, while Incyte (INCY) rose 8% and Biogen (BIIB) leapt 7%.RELATED:Apple, Microsoft, Cisco Eye Trump Overseas Cash Tax Plan

196,INCY,"Major stock indexes held big gains in afternoon trading Monday, cheered by news over the weekend that the FBI closed its investigation of Hillary Clinton's email issues for a second time.Various polls still point toward a tight race, one day ahead of Election Day. The latest IBD/TIPP poll shows Republican Trump at 43.1%, Democrat Clinton at 40.7%, Libertarian Gary Johnson at 6.3%, Green Jill Stein at 2.2%. The margin of error in the poll is plus or minus 3.1%.The Nasdaq composite rallied 2.3%, helped by strength in biotech stocks.  The S&P 500 rose 2% and the Dow Jones industrial average added 1.9%. Volume was tracking slightly lower than Friday's levels in the stock market today.JPMorgan (JPM), UnitedHealth (UNH) and Microsoft (MSFT) outperformed in the Dow with gains of around 3%. Apple (AAPL) lagged, rising 1%, after KGI Securities said iPhone shipments are likely to drop in the first half of 2017, primarily due to weak demand in China.Biotechs led the Nasdaq 1oo as names like Biogen (BIIB), Regeneron (REGN) and Incyte (INCY) showed gains of 5%-7%.Twenty IBD 50 components rose 3% or more, including Nvidia (NVDA), which reports earnings Thursday after the close. It's extended after a recent breakout from a flat base with a 63.59 entry. Group peer Inphi (IPHI) also did well Monday, rising nearly 4%. It's back above its 50-day moving average after a failed breakout over a 44.64 buy point.Ferrari (RACE) thundered 7% higher to 54.84 after scoring a strong third-quarter beat and raised guidance.

197,INCY,"Leading tech stocks tumbled last week as mutual funds sold shares in the likes of Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google. But the manager of $3 billion Franklin DynaTech Fund, an IBD Best Mutual Fund 2016 Award winner, isn't panicking.Judging by DynaTech's (FKDNX) lowly portfolio turnover rate of 31% and comments by lead manager Matthew Moberg on the power driving growth in several key holdings, the fund remains hitched in a big way to the market's leading stocks.DynaTech has an outsized bet on technology, with a 48% weighting as of June 30, according to Franklin Templeton.That sort of megabet on a single sector could make a fund volatile. But this fund's performance is consistent as well as strong. The fund was up 3.15% so far this year as of Oct. 31. The S&P 500 was up 5.87%. DynaTech's return topped 78% of its peers tracked by Morningstar Inc., all of which averaged a 0.91% gain.The fund generated average annual returns of 8.42%, 13.2% and 9.26% the past three, five and 10 years.The fund is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner for having outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31. Only 9% of U.S. diversified stock funds met that standard. It was in the top 100 in three categories: all U.S. equity, all large caps and all growth funds.Click Here To See A List Of IBD Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersMoberg, 45 years old, has been shepherding DynaTech since 2004. He talked with IBD about his investment approach from his office in San Mateo, Calif.IBD: Matthew, why does the fund have such a large technology weighting?Moberg: The fund focuses on innovation and growth.Our name, ""DynaTech,"" stands for dynamic technologies. We define dynamic as a force that stimulates change or progress. Innovation is where the bulk of wealth creation occurs. But we view this as a broad mandate. We're able to look for innovation anywhere.And we believe you need active management to invest in innovation. It's a part of the market that is often misunderstood. Some people believe it is too expensive, or too unknown. So that's an area we look through because those misunderstandings mean opportunities get overlooked.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category Performance LeadersIBD: Is your current tech weighting typical for the fund?Moberg: It's been as high as 50%. But sector classifications change. Amazon (AMZN) is now classified as a consumer discretionary stock. Early on, it was tech.Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) are holdings. They're still considered information technology companies. But one could argue that they are financials.We look for innovation, which can be found in a lot of places.IBD: Health care was your second largest sector, with a 27% weighting. That's another hotbed of innovation, right?Moberg: It's not a great year for health care because of the election (and some candidates talking about price controls). But, yes, there's a lot of innovation there. You see it in possibly emerging treatments for diseases like hepatitis C, cystic fibrosis, even cancer.IBD: What are some names you like in that space?Moberg: Celgene (CELG) and Incyte (INCY).Click Here To See A List Of Biggest Mutual Funds Ranked By PerformanceIBD: Is the fund's performance consistent because it is diversified? Because it's exposed to other sectors, not just tech and health care? Why else?Moberg: Yes, we are diversified. And consistency is also due to our fundamental research. Sometimes we find stocks that the market doesn't appreciate how quickly they will come to market. The best example is Facebook (FB). They launched their mobile ads in Q2 2012. In the first quarter they only did $13 million in revenue. That was 1.3% of their total revenue. Two years and three months later, mobile was doing $1.659 billion. That's more advertising revenue than CBS' $1.63 billion in the similar quarter.Technology adoption is accelerating. The world is more global. Investors often don't appreciate how fast a new technology rises. So we try to think long-term. Our short-term performance is just a byproduct of how we think long-term.IBD'S TAKE: See how near Facebook and other highly rated stocks are to proper buy points. Visit IBD's Leaderboard.IBD: What part of Facebook's story do you like the most now?Moberg: First, mobile usage. Mobile ads will be more effective than other ads, one could argue. Facebook probably has the best set of mobile applications. And there's a runway for growth there.Second, they're starting to monetize Instagram, where people share pictures. The next step is to monetize Messenger and WhatsApp. Usage on them has been explosive. And there's a good chance that this goes into commerce (rather than remain solely a social activity).Finally, when you're thinking about what they could monetize five or 10 years out, Oculus (which makes a virtual reality headset) is another interesting acquisition. Facebook didn't pay much for it. And they can probably monetize it in five to 10 years. It has a long runway, like Messenger and WhatsApp.IBD: Edwards Lifesciences (EW) seems to be benefiting from a new management fiscal discipline and from a key new product, their transcatheter aortic value replacement (TAVR).Moberg: Yes, right now they're going through a very nice product cycle with TAVR. It had a rough start. But now TAVR is an example of a sensational innovation. It enables patients to avoid the need for open-heart surgery, cracking open your rib cage, making a giant incision. Instead, they put the TAVR in through an artery with a small incision. Patients spend less time in the hospital, go through less pain. And with each iteration, the valve gets smaller and easier to insert.That product cycle will last another five-plus years.They're also working on something for mitral valves, which are harder to reach. We hope and expect them to be the leader in that field as well. If they can do it, it would double their addressable market.IBD: Edwards had disappointing sales in Q3 and its stock plummeted. How has this changed your outlook for the company and stock?Moberg: We remain positive on Edwards Lifesciences. Edwards is still in the early stages of capturing the transcatheter aortic valve replacement opportunity (65% share of a $2.5 billion or so market that is only about one-third penetrated).  Its stock also fails to account for any potential for the transcatheter mitral valve replacement opportunity, and mitral valve disease is twice as prevalent as aortic valve disease.  It has faced missteps in new products before — again the world doesn't work as linearly as we would like — but we believe this is an excellent business.IBD: I'll make a wild guess that you are not one of those investors who finds Amazon's product experiments wasteful.Moberg: They're incredibly innovative. They're continually investing in new things. They've had three big successes. The first was Prime. They get money upfront (from consumers). And it drove up usage of Amazon significantly. The second was letting third parties sell on the website, with fulfillment by Amazon. It required no investment in inventory, and generated higher margins.In addition, they have Amazon Web Services, which is increasingly important. It's one of the fastest growing software-as-a-service companies ever.Amazon continues to invest, find new ideas. They've had quite a few failures along the way, but I understand you need to take risk to succeed. That attitude gives us confidence in their continued growth.IBD: Any concerns about Amazon's miss on Q3 results? Any sign of more weakness to come?Moberg: They have gone through many investment cycles in the past. Step-ups in investments don't always, in fact rarely, work within a quarterly reporting cycle. We understand that.  Over the long term Amazon has had very good returns on invested capital, prefers to grow organically and has a culture of innovation.  We didn't see anything in the quarter that suggests that is no longer the case.IBD: Pioneer Natural Resource (PXD) is somewhat new to the portfolio. But it has seven straight quarters of slowing earnings. What's your thesis?Moberg: We like to invest in small positions, see how they do and try to hold on for the long-term. If anything fundamental changes and it's right, we add to it.Pioneer is one of the best positions in oil services. They are one of the lowest priced producers. We think oil will stabilize in the 50 to 60 per barrel range.IBD: Why do you like Chinese online gaming company NetEase (NTES)?Moberg: We believe the gaming space is a secular winner. NetEase has some games that have done well. And the secular trends on gaming are better in China than in the U.S., and it is very strong in the U.S. We will see more virtual reality and different kinds of games and ways for people to spend leisure time playing games.IBD: Do you still like Broadcom (AVGO) as much as you used to?Moberg: We don't believe it is as innovative as it used to be. Most of their accelerating earnings per share is due to consolidation. We prefer companies with innovation, which this was at first.Still, they are doing a great job buying companies, rationalizing costs, raising prices. Their CEO is incredibly well thought of in the (chipmaking) industry. He's executing on strategy extremely well. We're pleased that someone is taking the lead and starting consolidation in that industry.IBD: Nvidia (NVDA) is another relative newcomer to your portfolio. What do you like about their chipmaking?Moberg: They were viewed as a provider of graphics chips inside PCs. Then they expanded, making chips inside game consoles. Now they're broken free of that prison and making central processing units for virtual reality. They're also needed in cars, for autonomous driving. Also in hyperscale servers, they're used as co-processors. CAD-CAM, artificial intelligence — their total addressable market is exploding.We think there's a lot of sustainability to the company and a long trajectory for earnings growth.IBD: You have exposure to the pet care industry. What do you like there?Moberg: It's shocking how well we treat animals now vs. 20 or 30 years ago. Cancer treatment, CT scans — they were unavailable years ago. So we like the secular trend. The company we like most and have owned longer and have the largest position in is Idexx Labs (IDXX). Idexx is a particularly well-positioned business competitively, given its unique ability to single-handedly bundle both outsourced diagnostics and in-practice diagnostic instruments.  Idexx also offers superior information management capabilities regarding animal diagnostic reporting and record-keeping relative to competitors.IBD: What's special about Aspen Technology (AZPN), the software firm?Moberg: They do supply-chain management for process industries. This software is so important that even when companies go bankrupt, they pay their Aspen bill. It is the backbone for many companies.They have tremendous operating margin and profitability. There's some competition, but if you are a serious and large company, you need their technology. And customers are incredibly sticky.IBD: Tell me about your co-manager.Moberg: I am lead manager. The fund was founded in 1968. Rupert Johnson, my co-manager, was the fund's first manager. And as you may know he is also vice chairman of Franklin Resources.IBD: Matthew, people often wonder what portfolio managers do in their off hours. How about you?Moberg: I used to run 25 miles a week. I used to have hobbies. Now I have a 7-, 5- and a 1-year-old. They're my hobbies.And I forgot to mention that I'm an avid reader of history. I was a history major in college. I find that useful in looking at micro trends, adoption rates, periods of major and minor innovation, and pattern recognition of new technologies, as well as macro trends like low interest rates, Federal Reserve actions, periods and government responses.RELATED:Top Mutual Fund Manager Captures Solid Returns Without Messy EmotionsThis Top Mutual Fund Manager Wins With 3 Flavors Of Growth StocksHow Hartford Growth Opportunities Fund Targets Stocks With GiddyapHow Fidelity Contrafund Manager Will Danoff Played The Downturn

224,INCY,"Tuesday's announcement that Celgene (CELG) agreed to acquire Receptos (RCPT) pleased investors in those two stocks, but for investors in Gilead Sciences (GILD), which was rumored to be interested in Receptos, it means waiting on the edges of their seats.""Literally the only question I'm getting on Gilead is, 'When and who are they going to buy?'"" said Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum Monday in a video recorded for clients. ""The stock has moved because of broker meetings a month or two ago where they said, 'We're ready to do a deal.'""It's a crucial question for Gilead's future, because signs are that its blockbuster hepatitis C franchise is already hitting the ceiling in the U.S. after a record launch 18 months ago. However, that launch did give Gilead an enormous pile of cash to buy its next major drug line, which has set Wall Street's collective imagination into overdrive about what the target could be.Here are some of the most prominent suggestions that have come out in the last few months: Incyte (INCY): This was suggested on Tuesday by Nomura analyst Ian Somaiya in a note mainly about the Celgene-Receptos deal. Incyte's drug Jakafi treats a rare form of bone-marrow cancer as well as a blood disease called polycythemia vera. Gilead recently entered the blood-cancer market with Zydelig, which launched just shy of a year ago for chronic lymphocytic leukemia and two kinds of lymphoma. Somaiya noted that Incyte also has a promising pipeline that includes drugs for solid tumors.Incyte's 12-month revenue totaled $581 million, mostly from Jakafi, but the company has had inconsistent quarters on the bottom line. Analysts expect it to record its first annual profit next year, however, and grow rapidly after that. The stock has reflected these bullish expectations, with a Relative Strength Rating of 98 and an accumulation/distribution grade of B+. Incyte stock hit a new high of 121.70 early on the stock market today before retreating back near yesterday's close. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX): Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges caused a minor commotion when he endorsed this combination back in April. Vertex, whose own hepatitis C blockbuster was stomped out of existence by Gilead, is positioning itself as the dominant player in cystic fibrosis, as it's the only company that's proven to have a disease-altering treatment for the devastating condition. Porges pointed out that Gilead already sells a product to this market called Cayston, so it has its foot in the door.Gilead ""needs the promise or high probability of an incremental $5 billion to $7 billion of revenue to reassure investors about their future outlook,"" Porges wrote at the time, and in fact $5 billion a year is what many predict Vertex's CF drugs are going to do eventually. However, some other analysts doubted whether such a deal would happen, on the grounds that Vertex is expensive (market cap is hovering near $33 billion, and Porges' suggested price was $45 billion) and Gilead prefers to buy development-stage assets that it can then launch itself.Vertex's stock has been in a flat base since Porges floated his idea. Achillion Pharmaceuticals (ACHN): Buying Achillion would be going in the opposite direction in terms of size, as Achillion is a startup whose market cap is just over $1 billion. However, it has been the subject of speculation, given that it has a promising hepatitis C drug candidate of its own, which could potentially help Gilead extend its franchise through the coming next generation of treatments.In November, after Achillion's candidate ACH-3102 yielded excellent six-week results in a clinical trial when combined with Gilead's Sovaldi, FBR Capital analyst Andrew Berens argued that buying Achillion could get Gilead onto ""(the) expected trend in HCV intervention towards shortened treatment durations from the currently available eight-week and 12-week courses."" Then in May, a Twitter-storm of speculation erupted when Achillion abruptly pulled out of an investor conference, suggesting that it was about to announce something big. As it turned out, it was: Achillion had actually signed a licensing deal with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), which diminished the chances of a Gilead buyout. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY): What, a biotech buying a big pharma? Well, actually Gilead is bigger than Bristol now — it did almost $25 billion in sales last year, vs. Bristol's $16 billion — and Bristol's hottest new drugs are biologics, like its cancer drug Opdivo. Which was what TheStreet.com's Adam Feuerstein was thinking when he proposed the idea back in January: ""I'm not sure exactly which company Gilead will buy, but the acquisition focus will be oncology, and it will be transformative, just as Pharmasset was for its hepatitis C business.""The potential is certainly vast, given that Opdivo alone is expected to pass $6.5 billion in annual sales by 2020. However, the price would be even more staggering than Vertex's, and Bristol's market value has continued to go up since Feuerstein's prediction; it's now over $115 billion.

227,INCY,"December is usually a quiet month for medical tech news, but this year will bring a few potentially stock-moving events worth keeping an eye on.As you digest your Thanksgiving turkey, here are the top five in chronological order:By Dec. 5, biotech Incyte (INCY) is looking to get an important expansion of the label on its sole marketed drug, Jakafi. As explained in the recent Incyte profile in The New America, Incyte and its partner Novartis (NVS) have been pulling in respectable income on Jakafi as a treatment for a rare bone-marrow cancer called myelofibrosis. The FDA is pondering whether to add an indication for polycythemia vera, a milder but more common condition. While uptake for that condition is expected to be fairly slow, it's expected to help push Incyte into more consistently profitable territory next year.Two days later, hot medical-device company Edwards Lifesciences (EW) will hold its annual investor day, in which it is expected to give 2015 guidance for the first time. The company impressed the Street last month with its strong Q3 report and Q4 guidance, on the strong launch of its latest Sapien artificial heart valve. Currently, analysts are forecasting 2015 sales of $2.47 billion, up 7% from this year's estimate. Earnings per share are expected to rise 17% to $3.95.Then, sometime before Dec. 21 (which likely means Dec. 19), the FDA is due to issue its verdict on AbbVie's (ABBV) hepatitis C combo of Viekirax and Exviera. The clinical-trial data was so good, the Street would probably be less surprised if a meteor hit Manhattan than if the FDA rejects the drug, but what has analysts all on pins and needles is what the price will be. A price significantly lower than Gilead Sciences ' (GILD) recently launched Harvoni, which costs $94,000 for a 12-week treatment, would help AbbVie gain market share and certainly please pharmacy benefit managers like Express Scripts (ESRX), which has been hoping to start a price war to drive down the suddenly high cost of hepatitis C treatment. However, most analysts are expecting AbbVie to price only a little bit lower. Also affected by all this will be Enanta Pharmaceuticals (ENTA), which licensed a component of Viekirax to AbbVie.Speaking of hepatitis C, sometime before the end of the year the Street is expecting to hear phase one clinical-trial data on Achillion Pharmaceuticals' (ACHN) ACH-3422. The drug belongs to the coveted nucleoside inhibitor class, to which Gilead's mega-blockbuster Sovaldi (also a component in Harvoni) belongs, but which has otherwise shown enough safety issues that there are few left in development. Especially since Merck (MRK) acquired Idenix Pharmaceuticals for its ""nuc,"" speculation that Achillion could be the next target has driven up its stock price, but the Street has seen little real data about the safety and effectiveness of ACH-3422. The data would help analysts determine just how much the company is worth.Speculation exists about whether two aborted takeover attempts earlier this year will be re-upped. The Street seems to have mostly given up on the possibility that Pfizer (PFE) will make another bid for AstraZeneca (AZN) after the six-month cooling-off period mandated under U.K. takeover rules expired on Wednesday. Astra's CEO Pascal Soriot threw more cold water while appearing on CNBC Thursday, saying the deal would have fallen apart even if it had been made because of proposed restrictions on tax-inversion deals in the U.S. However, RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro is still holding out hope for a union of orthopedics firms Stryker (SYK) and Smith & Nephew (SNN). Stryker didn't bid for the company, but since a news report leaked that it was working on one, it got slapped with the U.K.'s six-month cooling-off period anyway, which expired Nov. 28.""We believe a SYK/SNN deal could provide more recon (reconstructive surgery) scale, particularly in international markets, expand SYK's presence in trauma/sports medicine, and bring cost synergies,"" Novarro wrote in a note Friday.
"
228,INCY,"Sometimes, drug launches take a while to get off the ground. Incyte's only approved drug, Jakafi, has been on the market three years, but it's really only just getting started.Jakafi, sold in some markets as Jakavi, is approved for a rare bone-marrow cancer called myelofibrosis (MF). Thanks to that indication, Incyte's (INCY) revenue is expected to pass $530 million this year, compared with just $94 million in 2011, the year Jakafi launched.It's the other indications in the pipeline, however, that could really push the drug into blockbuster territory.The first of these, expected to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration by Dec. 5, is for polycythemia vera (PV), a similar but somewhat milder disease, which has a potentially larger market.Meanwhile, clinical trials are going on for the really big-name cancers: pancreatic, breast, lung and colon.Current consensus estimates have Jakafi's annual sales in the U.S. hitting $1.3 billion by 2020. Abroad, where Incyte splits the take with marketing partner Novartis (NVS), sales are expected to pass $900 million by that year.""Incyte is based on the idea that research in cancer is a good investment,"" CEO Herve Hoppenot told IBD in an interview.Opportunity SeizedJakafi is a Janus associated kinase (JAK) inhibitor, regulating the signaling mechanisms in cells that play an important role in cell growth and immune response.Jakafi was the first JAK inhibitor on the market and so far the only one approved to fight cancer. Pfizer's (PFE) Xeljanz, approved in 2012, is also a JAK inhibitor but is used against rheumatoid arthritis.Hoppenot says that Incyte was originally aiming at the big cancers first, but the MF opportunity unexpectedly came up when scientists found that the JAK signaling played an important role in the disease.""At that point, the company decided to move the development program very quickly to myelofibrosis and try to prove that the JAK pathway was having an impact on the outcome for these patients,"" he said. ""We were able to get the pivotal studies done and the approval for myelofibrosis in a very rapid way.""Another advantage that the MF market brought to the firm was a small patient pool that had no other treatment options, so Incyte has been able to market it domestically without bringing in a big-pharma partner. It can thus keep all the domestic revenues for itself.Pursuing PV was the next logical step, Hoppenot says, because the diseases are so similar. Both of them are myeloproliferative disorders, which means that excess cells are produced in the bone marrow.PV, however, is much milder and can sometimes have no symptoms at all. Hoppenot estimates that only about 25% of the roughly 100,000 PV patients in the U.S. are eligible for Jakafi. He expects the liftoff to be fairly slow, because treating PV isn't as urgent as treating more malignant cancers.But the eventual market could be larger than that of MF, which has fewer than 14,000 sufferers, according to Leerink's estimate.These two diseases should bring Incyte its first annual profit next year, according to a consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Incyte turned a profit of 33 cents a share in the most recently reported quarter, but only because of two milestone payments that Incyte collected from Novartis on winning reimbursement for Jakafi in Europe and marketing approval in Japan.Starting in the second half of next year, analysts expect Incyte to start turning an operating profit in a more consistent way.Rivalry In The WingsThe year after that, however, new competition could threaten Jakafi. Gilead Sciences' (GILD) JAK inhibitor momelotinib is in a late-stage trial for MF, designed to compare momelotinib with Jakafi head to head. The results are expected to come out sometime next year.A couple of smaller players, CTI BioPharma (CTIC) and Geron (GERN), also have competitors in late-stage testing. On Nov. 13, the latter licensed its candidate, imetelstat, to Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) for development in multiple diseases, under a deal potentially worth $935 million if all the milestones are realized.Although only the data will tell how competitive these products will be, Incyte has other tools in its garage.INCB24360, a candidate from another drug class called IDO1 inhibitors, is being tested in combination with some of the most anticipated cancer drugs in the pipeline, the PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors. Incyte has partnered with all four of the leading contenders in the field — Bristol-Myers (BMY), AstraZeneca (AZN), Roche (RHHBY), and Merck (MRK) — to test their drugs together for a variety of cancers.These are not licensing deals, says Hoppenot. But they do mean that if and when the drugs are approved, the companies can recommend a successful combination on the drugs' labels.INCB24360 also garnered some attention at this summer's American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting, when it performed well in a trial combining it with a different though related Bristol-Myers drug, Yervoy, to treat melanoma.Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt wrote at the time that while the combo didn't appear to be as effective as Yervoy combined with Bristol's in-house anti-PD-1 Opdivo, it did suggest promise for combinations of INCB24360 with other anti-PD-1s.This news, along with a better-than-expected third quarter report last month, induced Goldman Sachs analyst Navdeep Singh to lift his rating on Incyte to neutral from sell and nearly double his price target to 62.""Our sell thesis was based on our more cautious view on Jakafi's launch for myelofibrosis (MF) given safety and competition, but this call has not worked as the narrative has shifted to INCY's pipeline,"" Singh wrote in his Oct. 31 research note. He added that following the newly out Q3 results and ASCO 2014, ""we are more encouraged by: (1) strong underlying growth for Jakafi in MF and (2) early data and partnership interest for IDO1 inhibitor.""

240,INCY,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Incyte is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for INCY in this report.Analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for INCY, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +92.00% heading into earnings season.Incyte Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Incyte Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Incyte Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that INCY has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Incyte and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

241,INCY,"Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) will report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, before market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.56%.Lilly’s shares have declined 5.5% this year so far, underperforming the industry 's decrease of 4.3%.Lilly’s performance has been pretty impressive with earnings beating expectations in each of the last four quarters, bringing the average positive surprise to 4.08%.Eli Lilly and Company Price and EPS Surprise  Eli Lilly and Company Price and EPS Surprise | Eli Lilly and Company QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors to ConsiderLike the previous couple of quarters, strong uptake trends of new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Cyramza, Jardiance and Lartruvo should make up for the decline in sales of established products like Zyprexa, Alimta, Cialis, Strattera and Effient.While Trulicity sales are being driven by growth in the GLP-1 market and market share gains, Jardiance sales are likely to be driven by increased market share within the growing SGLT2 class. The positive trend is expected to continue in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Trulicity first-quarter revenues is $586 million.Continued strong uptake outside the United States is likely to drive sales of Cyramza. Strong launch uptake is expected to drive sales of Taltz and Lartruvo.The loss of exclusivity in some countries for Cymbalta, Strattera, Effient, Axiron, Zyprexa and Evista will continue to hurt volumes. Also, lower demand in the United States due to competitive pressure mainly from immuno-oncology agents is hurting Alimta sales in the country – a trend which we believe persisted in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Alimta sales in the first quarter is pegged at $466 million.Olumiant (baricitinib) was launched in select European countries and in Japan in 2017 and generated sales of $46 million in the year supported by a strong launch uptake in Germany, The drug is under review in the United States. Lilly and partner Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) re-submitted the NDA for baricitinib in January.Verzenio, which was launched in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2017, generated sales of $21 million. We expect the new cancer drug to generate higher sales in the first quarter. Also, this advanced breast cancer treatment gained FDA approval in the first-line setting in February, which might have led to additional sales in the first quarter.Some older products like Humulin and Forteo are expected to do well while others like Cialis are likely to see weak sales due to lower demand.Elanco Animal Health segment sales were hurt by global competitive pressure in 2017, a trend that may have continued in the first quarter. On the fourth-quarter conference call, management had said that after being slightly negative in the first half of 2018, Animal Health revenues are expected to improve in the second half supported by new product launches. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales in the Animal Health segment is $770 million.Lilly is exploring strategic alternatives for this business including a sale, merger or creating a separate company through an initial public offer. A decision regarding the same is expected to be announced in July and Lilly may ultimately opt to retain the business. Investors may look for an update on the first-quarter conference call.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Lilly will beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

242,INCY,"The current year began on widespread optimism, predicting a significant increase in drug/biotech mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity, mainly buoyed by the new tax law enacted in December 2017 and purchasing newer technologies. The tax reform has lowered the tax rate and provided a low-tax window to bring back huge cash stashed overseas. These will certainly improve the cash position of the companies and fuel M&A activities amid struggling organic growth.With a quarter of the year already gone by, we have seen quite a few billion dollar buyout deals being inked. For instance, Celgene Corporation acquired Juno Therapeutics to add a CAR-T therapy to its pipeline for approximately $9 billion. Moreover, the company is in process to complete the acquisition of Impact Biomedicines for an upfront amount of $1.1 billion. Also, Sanofi in a bid to strengthen its blood disorder pipeline purchased Bioverativ for $11.6 billion and even offered to buy Belgian Biotech Company, Ablynx for $4.8 billion.Additionally, Pfizer is aggressively on the lookout for a buyer for its Consumer Healthcare unit after British firms Glaxo and Reckitt Benckiser Group withdrew from discussions. However, Glaxo announced its acquisition of Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) stake in their healthcare joint venture for $13 billion. Meanwhile late last month, Takeda also confirmed its intention to integrate Dublin-based Shire into its portfolio to boost its core therapeutic areas.Moreover, this week bore news of a couple of more M&A deals. A brief description of the two deals is as follows:Novartis to Buy AveXisNovartis inked a deal to acquire the U.S. based clinical stage gene therapy company, AveXis, Inc , to boost its presence in gene therapy and neuroscience space.AveXis’ lead gene therapy candidate, AVXS-101, is being developed to treat spinal muscular atrophy (""SMA""), a neurodegenerative disease, accounting for the highest genetic cause of death in infants. The only approved treatment for SMA is the Biogen’s Spinraza.Per the agreement, Novartis will close the acquisition in an all cash deal of $8.7 billion. The company proposed a cash-tender offer of $218 per share for AveXis’ common stock. The deal is expected to culminate in the second half of 2018. (Read more: Novartis Inks $8.7 Billion Gene Therapy Deal to Buy AveXis)Alexion-Wilson DealAlexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) announced that it will consolidate Sweden-based Wilson Therapeutics in its portfolio to add a late-stage candidate to its pipeline for the treatment of Wilson disease, a rare genetic disorder. The acquisition is line with the company’s strategy to diversify its portfolio and lower its dependence on its blockbuster drug, Soliris.Alexion has offered 232 Swedish Krona in cash for each outstanding share of Wilson Therapeutics, which translates into a total transaction value of $855 million. The buyout is expected to get wrapped up this quarter. (Read more: Alexion to Acquire Wilson Therapeutics for $855M)In this article, we suggest three drug/biotech companies as logical acquisition targets this year. The parameters counting for buying a drug/biotech stock are the current sales performance of its drugs/products, prospects of future sales growth and the quality of the company’s pipeline. Takeovers of small-cap drug/biotech companies are very difficult to forecast and are quite frequent in the said space. Hence, these have been excluded from the discussion.Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AGIO  -  Free Report)Agios Pharmaceuticals’ share price is witnessed to rally this week on speculations that the company might be bought by other big players in the pharma and biotech industry.The company received an FDA approval for Idhifa (enasidenib) in August 2017 for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”) with IDH2 mutation, lending a huge boost to its immense commercial potential in the target market. Agios’ ivosidenib is under review in the United States as a therapy for relapsed/refractory AML with IDH1 mutation. The candidate is also being developed for addressing advanced hematologic malignancies.Agios’ pipeline also includes a mid-stage genetic diseases candidate. A consistent progress with its investigational candidates makes the company one of the most lucrative takeover options for other large players in the drug/biotech space at the moment. (Read more: Agios Pharmaceuticals Shares Rise on Buyout Speculation)Agios carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BMRN  -  Free Report)Companies with product/pipeline portfolios comprising rare disease drugs are in great demand as there is less competition in the concerned space and the expensive treatments can garner huge profits. BioMarin is one such drug developer with a market cap of around $15 billion.BioMarin’s key orphan disease drugs, Vimizim and Kuvan, are doing well, backed by strong underlying patient demand trends. Also, another orphan drug Brineura’s earlier-than-expected approval this year for the treatment of children with CLN2 disease is likely to be a huge boost to BioMarin. A potential approval for pegvaliase is expected next month.BioMarin has already been a target of takeover speculation. Companies like Gilead, Amgen and Roche might be interested in buying BioMarin.BioMarin carries a Zacks Rank #3.Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (VRTX  -  Free Report)For Vertex, a consistent expansion in patient population raised revenues quarter to quarter throughout 2017. Moreover, the approval to its third cystic fibrosis (“CF”) drug, Symdeko (tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination), will further drive the company’s sales. The company is hopeful that a positive trend of CF sales will continue in 2018 as it gains additional reimbursement approvals for Orkambi in the ex-U.S. marketsMeanwhile, the company is focused on triple combination therapies for treating CF, which will further expand its patient population. The market cap of Vertex is more than $40 billion.Vertex carries a Zacks Rank #3.Incyte Corporation(INCY  -  Free Report)Incyte’s strong oncology portfolio makes it an attractive pick for companies, namely Gilead, Amgen and Bristol Myers. Incyte’s market cap is also around $15 billion.The primary reason why Incyte is ready for buyout is because of the encouraging performance of its two marketed products such as, Jakafi and Iclusig. Jakafi is seeing a strong sales performance, driven by solid patient demand in the approved indications.The company is also working on its further label expansion. Meanwhile, Incyte’s pipeline boasts candidates like immune therapy epacadostat, which is being studied in combination with other drugs for the cure of cancer and rheumatoid arthritis.Incyte carries a Zacks Rank #3.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

243,INCY,"The biotech sector was on a bumpy ride over the week as shares of Spectrum surged on positive data from a phase II study, while that of Incyte plunged on the failure of melanoma study. In an effort to bolster its presence in the gene therapy space Swiss giant Novartis announced the acquisition of AveXis Inc.Spectrum Surges on Lung Cancer Data: Shares of Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (SPPI  -  Free Report) surged after the company reported encouraging results from a phase II study on poziotinib in EGFR Exon 20 Mutant non-small cell lung cancer patients. The results show that the confirmed objective response rate was 64% in the first 11 patients, better than the expectations of 20% and 30%. These early data suggest that poziotinib may have a meaningful impact on outcomes for patients who have limited treatment options. The median progression-free survival rate has still not been reached after a median follow up period of 6.5 months. Meanwhile, the original cohort of 30 EGFR patients is fully enrolled and the expanded cohort of 20 patients is nearing the completion of enrollment.AveXis Skyrockets on Novartis Deal: AveXis, Inc.’s  shares skyrocketed on the news of a merger with Swiss pharma giant Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report).  Per the agreement, Novartis will pay $8.7 billion for this clinical stage gene therapy company. AveXis lead product candidate, AVXS-101, is being evaluated as one-time gene replacement therapy for spinal muscular atrophy, a disease which results in early death or life-long disability with considerable healthcare costs. The acquisition will poise Novartis in the promising gene therapy space. The acquisition will be completed in mid-2018. The candidate enjoys a breakthrough therapy designation in the United States and Prime designation in Europe. The FDA also granted AVXS-101, a fast track status for the treatment of SMA Type 1.  A regulatory filing in the United States is expected in the second half of this year with a launch anticipated in 2019. (Read more: Novartis Inks $8.7 Billion Gene Therapy Deal to Buy AveXis)Incyte Plunges on Study Failure: Shares of Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) plunged after an external Data Monitoring Committee review of the phase III study, ECHO-301/KEYNOTE-252 evaluating Incyte’s epacadostat in combination with Merck’s Keytruda in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma determined that the study did not meet the primary endpoint of improving progression-free survival in the overall population when compared to Keytruda monotherapy. Moreover, the second primary endpoint of overall survival is not expected to reach statistical significance either. Hence, the study will be stopped.The failure of the late-stage candidate disappointed investors as Incyte had pinned hopes on the success given the improved response rates in mid-stage studies. (Read more: Incyte's Epacadostat Fails in Melanoma Study, Shares Plunge)Conatus Pharmaceuticals Sinks on Study Failure:  Conatus Pharmaceuticals (CNAT  -  Free Report) plummeted after it reported that its pipeline candidate, emricasan, failed in a phase IIB study – POLT-HCV-SVR. The candidate did not achieve primary endpoint in the study, which evaluated patients with fibrosis or cirrhosis undergoing liver transplant.  Data from the POLT-HCV-SVR study showed that emricasan did not achieve a better overall response rate compared to placebo in the overall patient population.However, in patient subset with advanced fibrosis or early cirrhosis, emricasan provided evidence of an anti-fibrotic treatment effect in 95% of the patients compared to 58.3% for placebo. The company may evaluate emricasan further in this particular subset.

Shares of the company have also declined 77% over a year compared with the industry’s decline of 11.5%. NewLink’s decision came in response to the Incyte Corp.’s (INCY  -  Free Report)  and partner Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) announcement of the failure of a key melanoma combination study on Friday Incyte and Merck said that a combination of Incyte’s epacadostat and Merck’s Keutruda failed in achieving improved progression free survival over Keytruda alone in phase III study ECHO-301/KEYNOTE-252. The study was evaluating the combination drugs for the treatment unresectable or metastatic melanoma.An external data monitoring committee recommended the termination of the study following the review of the data from the pivotal study.Data from the phase III study demonstrated that a combination of IDO1 inhibitor and PD-1 antagonists may not hold potential in treatment of melanoma which obviously raised doubts over the potential success of indoximod combination studies with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agent.Newlink will provide an update when the review is complete. Newlinkclaims that indoximod has a differentiated mechanism of action (MOA) and it has demonstrated that it can improve the outcomes for patients with cancer in combination studies.The results of the ECHO-301 study also affected several companies like Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY  -  Free Report) which are developing combination immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer.NewLink Genetics Corporation Price NewLink Genetics Corporation Price | NewLink Genetics Corporation QuoteZacks Rank NewLink carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

245,INCY,"Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) and partner Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) announced the failure of a combination therapy — Incyte’s epacadostat and Merck’s Keytruda — in achieving improved progression free survival over Keytruda alone in phase III study ECHO-301/KEYNOTE-252. The study was evaluating the combination drugs for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma.An external data monitoring committee recommended the termination of the study following the review of the data from the pivotal study.Data from the phase III study demonstrated that a combination of IDO1 inhibitor and PD-1 antagonists may not hold potential in treatment of melanoma.Shares of the company tumbled nearly 23% on Apr 6 following the disappointing news. Incyte’s stock has been down 32.4% so far this year compared to the industry’s loss of 11.8% in the period.Epacadostat, an IDO1 inhibitor immunotherapy, is a late stage pipeline candidate of Incyte which is being developed in combination with other immunotherapies, which include Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY  -  Free Report) PD-1 inhibitor, Opdivo, and CTLA-4 inhibitor, Yervoy. Incyte is developing the combination therapies in several other indications which includes non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and bladder cancer.Epacadostat combination therapies have achieved improved response rates in mid-stage studies. However, failure in the pivotal melanoma study with larger patient population increases the risk of setback in other late-stage studies for other indications.Following the news of this failure, shares of NewLink Genetics Corporation (NLNK  -  Free Report), a small IA-based biotech company, sank nearly 43% on Friday.

246,INCY,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 5.2% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is INCY due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Incyte Beats on Q4 Revenues on Strong Jakafi SalesIncyte reported a net loss of $0.71 compared to a net income of $0.05 in the year-ago quarter. The fourth-quarter saw a significant surge in R&D expenses. Excluding one-time charges and stock-based compensation expenses, earnings per share was $0.02.The Zacks Consensus Estimate was a loss of $0.52.Quarterly revenues were $444.1 million, up 36.1% year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $418.4 million. The top line was driven by higher sales of Jakafi in the United States and Iclusig in Europe as well as royalties from sales of Jakavi and Olumiant outside the United States.Quarter in DetailJakafi sales grew 26.9%, year over year to $302 million driven by strong patient demand for both indications. Net product revenues of Iclusig amounted to $19.5 million, up from $12.9 million in the year-ago quarter. Product royalty revenues from Novartis AG for the commercialization of Jakafi in ex-U.S. markets grew 57.4% to $52.3 million.R&D expenses were up to $447 million from $161.6 million in the year-ago quarter. SG&A expenses amounted to $98 million, up 1.8% year over year.2018 OutlookThe company expects Jakafi revenues in the range of $1,350-$1,400 million. Iclusig revenues are expected in the range of $80-$85 million.R&D expenses are expected in the range of $1,077-1,172 million. SG&A expenses are still expected in the range of $465-$480 million.Pipeline UpdateThe phase II trial, REACH1 trial evaluating Jakafi in patients with steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease (“GVHD”) has completed enrolment and results are expected in the first half of 2018. Assuming the success of the trial, Incyte expects to submit sNDA seeking approval of Jakafi for this indication.The phase III trial, ECHO-301, evaluating epacadostat plus Keytruda in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma is now fully-recruited and initial data are expected in the first half of 2018.Incyte has also opened eight new pivotal trials of epacadostat plus PD-1 antagonists in collaboration with Merck & Co. and Bristol-Myers Squibb.In December 2017, the New Drug Application (NDA) for baricitinib was resubmitted to the FDA. This was classified as a Class II resubmission, which began a new six-month review cycle. A pivotal trial of baricitinib in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis has also been initiated.The European Commission has already approved baricitinib as Olumiant in February 2017 for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to or are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter.Incyte Corporation Price and Consensus Incyte Corporation Price and Consensus | Incyte Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, INCY has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum is doing a lot better with a C. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.The company's stock is suitable solely for momentum based on our styles scores.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of this revision indicates a downward shift. Interestingly, INCY has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

247,INCY,"AstraZeneca, plc (AZN  -  Free Report) has announced that final overall survival data from the pivotal phase III MYSTIC study, evaluating its PD-L1 inhibitor Imfinzi in the first line lung cancer, will be presented in the second half of 2018, delayed from the first half expected previously.The MYSTIC study evaluated Imfinzi, both as a monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab, in treatment-naïve non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.AstraZeneca’s shares have inched up 0.2% so far this year, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s growth of 1.7%. This is the second negative update from AstraZeneca in relation to the MYSTIC trial. Last July, the pharma company had reported about the study’s failure to meet its primary endpoint of progression-free-survival, sending the company’s shares tumbling.The study showed that Imfinzi in combination with tremelimumab could not improve progression-free survival (PFS) when compared with platinum-based chemotherapy in patients, whose tumors express PD-L1 on 25% or more of their cancer cells. Imfinzi monotherapy also fell short of showing a benefit on PFS.However, the MYSTIC study continued thereafter as planned to assess the additional primary endpoints of overall survival (OS) for both monotherapy and combination regimen. Final OS data from both primary endpoints were initially expected during the first half of 2018.Imfinzi is a key drug in London-based AstraZeneca’s immuno-oncology (IO) pipeline, currently being evaluated for multiple cancers either alone or in combination with other regimens including Incyte’s (INCY  -  Free Report) epacadostat. Key phase III trials in combination with tremelimumab for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, liver cancer), NSCLC, small cell lung cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) among others are under way.Imfinzi was launched in the United States for the first indication — second-line advanced bladder cancer — in May 2017. It was approved for the second indication in the United States — early stage lung cancer (NSCLC) — in February 2018. The drug generated sales of $19 million last year.Talking about PD-L1 inhibitors, Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda and Bristol Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo have been notable successful launches. While Keytruda fetched in sales of $3.8 billion in 2017, up almost 172% year over year, Opdivo recorded $1.36 billion of revenues during the period, up 4%.AstraZeneca carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

248,INCY,"The pharma and biotech stocks kicked off 2018 on a strong note, carrying on the momentum gained last year. Though the sector has been struggling lately, probably on broader market pressure, it is expected to rebound as the year progresses.Innovation, mergers and acquisitions (M&As), strong results, product approvals and positive data flow should act as catalysts for pharma and biotech stocks.M&As to Accelerate Last year was not particularly great as far as M&A deals were concerned. Industry bellwether Johnson & Johnson acquired Actelion for approximately $30 billion, while Gilead acquired Kite for $11.9 billion. However, this year, expectations of an increase in M&A activity are high. The new tax law, which cuts the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and encourages companies to bring back cash held overseas at a one-time tax rate of 10%, is expected to spur merger activity. Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and Celgene CELG have already announced two deals each so far this year.Sanofi announced deals to buy Belgian biotech company Ablynx and hemophilia-focused biotech Bioverativ BIVV. Celgene announced deals to buy Juno Therapeutics, Inc. JUNO, which focuses on the development of CAR-T therapies, and Impact Biomedicines, which will add a late-stage JAK2 kinase inhibitor, to Celgene’s pipeline.Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has proposed to buy Australian oncolytic immunotherapies maker Viralytics Ltd. to strengthen its presence in the fast-growing immuno-oncology market. While some of these companies are looking to replace sales of blockbuster products that are facing loss of patent exclusivity, others are looking to build their pipelines both through acquisitions as well as licensing agreements.Companies with innovative technologies and pipelines are highly sought after. Niche disease areas like nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), immuno-oncology and multiple sclerosis are in demand. Treatments for orphan diseases are also much sought after, with quite a few deals being signed in these areas. With the Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) -- Kite and Celgene -- Juno acquisitions and the approval of the two CAR-T therapies in the United States last year – Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah and Gilead’s Yescarta -- interest in immuno-oncology has picked up significantly.Innovative PipelinesPharma and biotech companies continue to work on bringing innovative treatments to market. There could be significant catalysts in the coming quarters in the form of important new product approvals as well as major data read-outs, especially in key therapeutic areas like immuno-oncology, Alzheimer’s, central nervous system disorders and immunology/inflammation.Cancer Remains a Key Therapeutic AreaAlthough several new treatments have emerged in the field of cancer, interest in this area remains high with the disease being one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality across the world. Even though a lot of progress has been made in this area, companies are aiming to bring out newer and better treatments. Focus in this area has increased with the recent FDA approval of CAR-T therapies Kymriah and Yescarta.The approval of Kymriah and Yescarta marks the beginning of a new era in the treatment of cancer. The path-breaking immunocellular therapy is a one-time treatment that uses a patient's own T-cells to fight cancer. The acquisition of Kite by Gilead and the potential acquisition of Juno by Celgene have led to renewed interest in this area.Major players in this field include Bristol-Myers, Novartis, AstraZeneca, Merck and Roche.Immuno-oncology deals are being inked by companies like Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Celgene, Merck KGaA, Bristol-Myers BMY, AstraZeneca AZN, AbbVie ABBV and Incyte (INCY  -  Free Report). Interest in PARP inhibitors has also increased considerably as they could well be the next major class of therapeutics in oncology.According to IMSQuintiles, 68 new cancer drugs were approved for 22 indications from 2011 to 2016. Worldwide costs for cancer therapeutics and supportive care drugs shot up from $91 billion in 2012 to $113 billion in 2016 with the United States accounting for 46% of the costs. More than 600 molecules are in late-stage development, with the majority being targeted therapy.New Product Sales Should Ramp UpSales of products that have gained approval over the last two years, as well as line and usage extensions, should boost growth. Recent entrants like Novartis’ psoriasis treatment Cosentyx, Merck’s PD-1 inhibitor, Keytruda and Pfizer’s cancer treatment Ibrance have already achieved blockbuster status and are key contributors to the top line. Meanwhile, cancer treatments like Lynparza, Kyprolis, Keytruda, Opdivo and Imbruvica should also bring in more sales thanks to label expansions.Higher Number of Drugs Approved in 2017In 2017, the FDA granted approval to 46 novel drugs, more than double of last year’s total tally of 22. Key approvals this year include, Novartis’s Kymriah (the first gene therapy in the United States), Lilly’s Verzenio (advanced or metastatic breast cancer), Gilead’s Vosevi (hepatitis C virus), Puma’s Nerlynx (to reduce the risk of breast cancer returning), J&J’s Tremfya (moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis), Regeneron/Sanofi’s Kevzara (rheumatoid arthritis), Roche’s multiple sclerosis treatment, Ocrevus, Regeneron and Sanofi’s eczema treatment, Dupixent, TESARO’s PARP inhibitor, Zejula, BioMarin’s Brineura (treatment of a specific form of Batten disease), AbbVie’s Mavyret (HCV) and Gilead’s Yescarta among others. Quite a few of these drugs have blockbuster potential.Some of the key drugs currently under FDA review with decisions expected in a couple of months include Teva’s fremanezumab (migraine), Amgen’s Aimovig (prevention of migraine), J&J’s apalutamide (pre-metastatic prostate cancer) and AbbVie’s elagolix (endometriosis with associated pain). Meanwhile, the agency is working on streamlining the development process for drugs for rare diseases as well as targeted cancer therapies. Earlier this month, the FDA proposed new guidelines, which are aimed at lowering the clinical study goals of treatments being developed for neurological disorders such as muscular dystrophies, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), migraine and epilepsy that aren’t adequately addressed by available therapies. The FDA is also working on clearing up a backlog of orphan drug applications.According to the IMSQuintiles report, the late-phase R&D pipeline for the industry indicates that there should be about 40-45 new brand launches every year through 2021.Tech Tie-Ups to Pick Up PaceThe Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) could well be the future of healthcare as pharma companies look to innovate and keep up with technology to help patients and physicians better monitor and track diseases.IoMT involves the bringing together of technology and medical devices and applications. Chronic diseases, which require frequent monitoring, can be tracked effectively so that patients receive timely and proper treatment. Wearable devices like Apple Watch, Fitbit and Samsung S Health help users achieve their fitness and health targets.Pharma and tech companies are now taking things a step further and collaborating to make devices that can track chronic and lifestyle associated diseases like diabetes, which are becoming rampant.In fact, the scope for innovation in this area -- contact lenses that can detect glucose levels, devices that monitor caloric intake, bioelectronic medicines that may treat a wide range of chronic diseases, robotic-assisted surgery – is seemingly endless.Stock PicksAlthough the sector may face some volatility due to the drug pricing issue, pipeline success in innovative and important therapeutic areas, cost-cutting, share buybacks, new products, increased pipeline visibility and appropriate utilization of cash should help maintain investor confidence in this sector.Companies like Pfizer, AbbVie, Novo Nordisk (NVO  -  Free Report), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report), Zoetis, Inc. (ZTS  -  Free Report), Bioverativ, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. AMPH, Horizon Pharma Public Ltd. Co.

250,INCY,"Accurate identification of overhyped toxic stocks and the rightly priced ones is very important for investing success. However, correctly figuring out toxic stocks and removing them at the right time to make some profits is not easy.Overblown toxic stocks are usually susceptible to external shocks. Also, these stocks are burdened with a huge amount of debt. Price of these toxic stocks is unrealistically high. However, the high price of the toxic stocks is only short lived as it is higher than its intrinsic value.Investors may gain from the correct identification of toxic stocks with the help of an investing strategy known as short selling. This strategy allows them to sell a stock first and then buy it when the price falls.While short selling excels in bear markets, it typically loses money in bull markets.So, spotting toxic stocks and throwing them away at the right time is the key to guard your portfolio from big losses. Profits can be made by short selling them.Screening CriteriaHere is a winning strategy that will help you to identify overpriced toxic stocks:Most recent Debt/Equity Ratio greater than the median industry average: High debt/equity ratio implies high leverage. High leverage indicates a huge level of repayment that the company has to make in connection with the debt amount.P/E using 12-month forward EPS estimate greater than 50: A very high forward P/E implies that a stock is highly overvalued.% Change in F (1) and F (2) Estimate (12 Weeks) less than 0: Negative EPS estimate revision for this and the next fiscal year during the past 12 weeks points to analysts’ pessimism.Zacks Rank more than or equal to #3 (Hold): We have not considered Buy-rated stocks that generally outperform the market.Here are five of the 18 toxic stocks that showed up on the screen:Wilmington, DE-based Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) is a drug discovery company.

251,INCY,"Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) reported a net loss of 71 cents compared to a net income of 5 cents in the year-ago quarter. The fourth-quarter saw a significant surge in R&D expenses. Excluding one-time charges and stock-based compensation expenses, earnings per share was $0.02.The Zacks Consensus Estimate was a loss of 52 cents.Incyte Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Incyte Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Incyte Corporation QuoteQuarterly revenues were $444.1 million, up 36.1% year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $418.4 million. The top line was driven by higher sales of Jakafi in the United States and Iclusig in Europe as well as royalties from sales of Jakavi and Olumiant outside the United States. Incyte’s stock lost 29.6% over the past year, compared with the industry’s  1.9% decline.Quarter in DetailJakafi sales grew 26.9%, year over year to $302 million driven by strong patient demand for both indications. Net product revenues of Iclusig amounted to $19.5 million, up from $12.9 million in the year-ago quarter. Product royalty revenues from Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) for the commercialization of Jakafi in ex-U.S. markets grew 57.4% to $52.3 million.R&D expenses were up to $447 million from $161.6 million in the year-ago quarter. SG&A expenses amounted to $98 million, up 1.8% year over year.2018 OutlookThe company expects Jakafi revenues in the range of $1,350-$1,400 million. Iclusig revenues are expected in the range of $80-$85 million.R&D expenses are expected in the range of $1,077-1,172 million. SG&A expenses are still expected in the range of $465-$480 million.Pipeline UpdateThe phase II trial, REACH1 trial evaluating Jakafi in patients with steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease (“GVHD”) has completed enrolment and results are expected in the first half of 2018. Assuming the success of the trial, Incyte expects to submit sNDA seeking approval of Jakafi for this indication.The phase III trial, ECHO-301, evaluating epacadostat plus Keytruda in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma is now fully-recruited and initial data are expected in the first half of 2018.Incyte has also opened eight new pivotal trials of epacadostat plus PD-1 antagonists in collaboration with Merck & Co. (MRK  -  Free Report) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report).In December 2017, the New Drug Application (NDA) for baricitinib was resubmitted to the FDA. This was classified as a Class II resubmission, which began a new six-month review cycle. A pivotal trial of baricitinib in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis has also been initiated.The European Commission has already approved baricitinib as Olumiant in February 2017 for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to or are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs.Our TakeIncyte beat on sales in the fourth quarter on strong Jakafi performance. Jakafi sales were driven by patient demand. The sales guidance for 2018 was also impressive.The label expansion of Jakafi for GVHD will further boost sales. Meanwhile, the NDA for Olumiant was resubmitted and a potential approval will further boost the top line.Zacks RankIncyte currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

252,INCY,"Wilmington, DE-based Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of proprietary therapeutics.Incyte’s lead drug, Jakafi (ruxolitinib), is a first-in-class JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, approved for the treatment of patients with polycythemia vera (PV), patients with intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis (MF), including primary MF, post-PV MF, and post-essential thrombocythemia MF. Incyte continues to gain traction by Jakafi’s performance. Jakafi sales are being driven by patient demand. The company is also working to expand the drug’s label.While Jakafi sales and royalties are a key component of Incyte’s revenue growth, Iclusig sales and Olumiant royalties are also contributing to the top line. In February 2017, the European Commission approved Olumiant for patients with rheumatoid arthritis.Incyte’s earnings track record has been mixed so far. Of the last four quarters, the company surpassed expectations in three and missed estimates in one. Overall, Incyte delivered an average positive surprise of 42.9%. Incyte Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Incyte Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Incyte Corporation QuoteCurrently, Incyte has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but that could definitely change following the company’s earnings report which was just released.

253,INCY,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Incyte is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for INCY in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at a loss of 40 cents per share for INCY, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 50 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for INCY, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +20.72% heading into earnings season.Incyte Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Incyte Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Incyte Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that INCY has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Incyte, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read This The most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more. Those gains, however, came with serious volatility and risk. Bitcoin sank 25% or more 3 times in 2017.Zacks has just released a new Special Report to help readers capitalize on the explosive profit potential of Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies with significantly less volatility than buying them directly.See 4 crypto-related stocks now >>

254,INCY,"Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 15, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company beat estimates by 183.33%.Incyte’s earnings track record has been mixed so far. Of the last four quarters, the company surpassed expectations in three and missed estimates in one.Overall, Incyte delivered an average positive surprise of 42.9%.  Incyte’s stock lost 33% in the last six months, worse than the industry’s decline of 5.8%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Incyte is likely to beat on earnings this quarter because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP:  Incyte has an Earnings ESP of +18.86%, representing the difference between the Most Accurate estimate (loss of 40 cents per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (loss of 49 cents). A positive ESP hints at an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank:  Incyte has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. Further, combined with a positive ESP, chances of an earnings beat are usually pegged higher.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Incyte Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Incyte Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Incyte Corporation Quote Factors Driving the GrowthIncyte’s lead drug, Jakafi (ruxolitinib), is a first-in-class JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, approved for the treatment of patients with polycythemia vera (PV), patients with intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis (MF), including primary MF, post-PV MF, and post-essential thrombocythemia MF. While Incyte markets the drug in the United States, it is marketed by Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) as Jakavi outside the country.Incyte continues to gain traction by Jakafi’s performance. Jakafi sales are being driven by patient demand. Jakafi was included as a recommended treatment for patients with myelofibrosis and patients with polycythemiavera in the latest National Comprehensive Cancer Network (“NCCN”) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) in July 2017. This is likely to boost the demand further.Based on strong performance in the first nine months of 2017, the company upped guidance for Jakafi and now expects revenues in the range of $1,125-$1,135 million, up from the earlier projected range of $1,090-$1,120 million.The company is also working to expand the drug’s label. Results from a phase III trial, REACH3 evaluating Jakafi as a treatment for patients with steroid-refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease (“GVHD”) is expected in the first half of 2018. Assuming positive results, Incyte plans to submit a sNDA seeking accelerated approval of Jakafi in this indication in 2018. Further updates are expected along with the fourth-quarter earnings call.We remind investors that while Jakafi sales and royalties are a key component of Incyte’s revenue growth, Iclusig sales and Olumiant royalties are also contributing to the top line.In February 2017, the European Commission approved Olumiant for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The approval triggered a $65-million payment to Incyte from Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) along with additional potential milestone payments, as well as royalties on sales of Olumiant. The approval provides Incyte with a further valuable source of revenues, given the potential for milestones and royalties under the company’s license agreement with Eli Lilly. Olumiant is being studied for additional indications as well — atopic dermatitis (phase IIa) and systemic lupus erythematosus (phase II).Incyte’s pipeline also holds promise. The phase III trial, ECHO-301, evaluating epacadostat plus Keytruda in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma is now fully-recruited and data are expected in the first half of 2018.R&D expenses are now expected in the range of $1,250-1,300 million, up from the earlier forecast of $1,050-1,150 billion due to the acceleration of the phase III plans for epacadostat. SG&A expenses are expected in the range of $340-$360 million.A Stock to ConsiderHere is one other health care stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to beat on earnings:Exelixis (EXEL  -  Free Report), which is expected to release fourth-quarter results on Feb 26, has an Earnings ESP of +21.98% and a Zacks Rank #2.

255,INCY,"Prothena Corporation plc (PRTA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 14.Last quarter, the company reported a narrower-than-expected loss resulting in a positive earnings surprise of 2.84%.  Notably, Prothena’s track record has been decent so far. The company reported a narrower-than-expected loss in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 15.6%.  Prothena’s share price has fallen 52.6% in the last six months, as against the industry’s ’s decline of 3.5%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Pipeline Progress in FocusProthena’s top line primarily comprises collaboration revenues earned through its license, development and commercialization agreements. In fact, the company earns collaboration revenues mainly under its license agreement with Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) for PRX002.We expect investors focus to remain on pipeline updates as it has no approved product in its portfolio.Prothena’s late-stage candidate, NEOD001, is being evaluated in a phase III VITAL Amyloidosis study for the treatment of patients with AL amyloidosis and in a phase IIb PRONTO study for the treatment of patients with AL amyloidosis and persistent cardiac dysfunction. Enrolment was completed in the VITAL study. The original target enrolment of 236 patients was exceeded and 260 patients have been randomized into the study.  The company also completed enrolment in the PRONTO study and top-line results from the study are expected following the 12-month study period in second-quarter 2018.Moreover, Prothena is evaluating PRX002, in collaboration with Roche for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease and other related synucleinopathies. The company initiated a phase II study, PASADENA, in patients suffering from Parkinson`s disease in second-quarter 2017.The initiation triggered a $30-million milestone from Roche to Prothena.However, Prothena announced disappointing results from a phase Ib multiple ascending dose study of pipeline candidate, PRX003 in psoriasis patients. The primary objectives of the study were achieved. However, advancing PRX003 into mid-stage clinical development required a well-defined relationship between biological activity and meaningful clinical effects and these prerequisites were not met.Like any other development-stage biotechnology company, Prothena is likely to see an increase in research and development expenses due to higher spending on pipeline.Earnings WhispersOur proven model doesn’t conclusively show that Prothena is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat earnings. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of $1.44. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Prothena currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Note that we caution against a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) stock going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Exelixis (EXEL  -  Free Report), which is expected to release fourth-quarter results on Feb 26, has an Earnings ESP of +21.98% and a Zacks Rank #2.

256,INCY,"Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) recently announced that the first patient has been treated in the RESET trial on ruxolitinib.The trial is evaluating ruxolitinib compared to anagrelide for the treatment of patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) who are resistant to or are intolerant to hydroxyurea (HU).The randomized, double-blind, double-dummy pivotal study (NCT03123588) evaluates the safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib versus anagrelide for the treatment of ET, a rare and chronic blood cancer.The study is now likely to enrol approximately 120 patients, 18 years or older, with ET who are resistant to or are intolerant to HU.The primary endpoint of this study is to find out the number of patients who achieve platelet and WBC control over 1 year of follow-up. Key secondary endpoints include safety and tolerability and the proportion of patients who achieve complete remission or partial remission.We note that ruxolitinib is approved as Jakafi in the United States for the treatment of polycythemia vera (PV) patients who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to HU.Jakafi is also approved for treatment of patients suffering from intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis (MF), including primary MF, post–polycythemia vera MF, and post-essential thrombocythemia MF.The drug is marketed by partner Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) outside the United States.  Incyte’s shares have moved up 4.9% year to date compared with the industry’s 1.6% gain.In order to augment the commercial potential of the drug, the company is working on expanding the drug’s label further. Incyte has initiated a phase II study (REACH-1) on Jakafi, in combination with corticosteroids, in patients with steroid-refractory acute Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).Assuming REACH 1 trial will be successful, the company plans to submit an sNDA seeking accelerated approval of Jakafi for the treatment of patients with steroid-refractory acute GVHD during 2018.Meanwhile, RESET-272, the double-blind, randomized pivotal trial of Jakafi versus anagrelide for the treatment of patients with essential thrombocythemia who are resistant to or are intolerant to HU, is now open for enrolment. Based on strong performance so far in 2017, the company upped guidance for Jakafi and now expects revenues in the range of $1,125-$1,135 million, up from the earlier projected range of $1,090-$1,120 million.Zacks Rank & Key PicksIncyte currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the health care sector are Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  and Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated (CORT  -  Free Report).

257,INCY,"AstraZeneca plc (AZN  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 core earnings of 56 cents per American Depositary Share (ADS), which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 57 cents. Core earnings declined 17% year over year at constant exchange rates (CER). Lower product sales and gross margins and higher SG&A costs hurt profits in the quarter.Total revenue rose 10% at CER to $6.23 billion in the reported quarter. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.75 billion. Revenues, however, gained mainly from the $997 million payment from Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) for the oncology collaboration the companies announced in July to jointly commercialize and develop Lynparza/selumetinib.Meanwhile, product sales declined in the quarter due to generic competition facing some legacy products.Key growth platforms (representing 66% of total revenues) were up 6% in the quarter at CER. Among the key growth platforms, Emerging Markets, New Cardiovascular & Metabolic Diseases (CVMD), New Oncology and Japan performed well in the quarter. However, Respiratory sales declined 2% in the reported quarter.All growth rates mentioned below are on a year-over-year basis and at CER.Product Sales DeclineProduct sales declined 2% in the quarter to $4.88 billion due to lower sales in the United States as well as Europe, which offset strong performance in emerging markets and in China.Crestor sales declined 14% to $580 million with sales in the United States and Europe down due to the entry of multiple generic versions of the drug in the market.Seroquel XR sales declined 68% to $62 million due to competition from generic launches.In the quarter, Onglyza sales declined 25% to $127 million due to competitive pressure in the DPP-4 class.Symbicort sales were down 4% in the quarter to $668 million due to lower sales in the United States and Europe. U.S. sales declined in the due to continued pricing pressure from managed-care access within the ICS/LABA class and also competition from other class like LAMA/LABA combination medicines.Nexium recorded sales of $469 million, down 7%. However, some legacy products that recorded growth in the quarter include Farxiga/Forxiga (up 29% to $285 million), Daliresp/Daxas (up 26% to $53 million), Faslodex (up 16% to $241 million), Iressa (up 10% to $137 million), Pulmicort (up 9% to $242 million) and Atacand (up 11% to $80 million).Among the newer medicines, Lynparza sales rose 36% to $81 million. While sales in the United States gained from the label expansion approval in August for the treatment of second-line ovarian cancer, in Europe, sales were pushed higher by a number of successful launches.Brilinta/Brilique sales were $284 million in the reported quarter, up 36% year over year and 4.4% sequentially. Brilinta maintained its leadership position in the U.S. branded oral anti-platelet market. In the United States., Europe and China, Brilinta continued to display an impressive performance.Tagrisso, launched in 2015, recorded sales of $248 million, up 7% sequentially. Another new medicine, Movantik/Moventig recorded sales of $30 million in the quarter, less than $32 million in the previous quarter.Bevespi, a LAMA/LABA in a pressurized metered dose inhaler launched commercially in the United States in January 2017, recorded sales of $4 million in the quarter, less than $3 million in the second quarter as the LAMA/LABA class grew more slowly than anticipated.PD-L1 inhibitor Imfinzi, launched for second-line bladder cancer in the United States in May, did not generate any sales in the third quarter against $1 million in the second quarter. A regulatory application seeking label expansion of Imfinzi to treat an earlier stage of lung cancer was granted priority review by the FDA last month.Imfinzi is a key candidate in the company’s immuno-oncology pipeline,which is beingevaluated for multiple cancers, either alone or in combination with other regimens. Last month, AstraZeneca expanded its clinical trial collaboration with Incyte (INCY  -  Free Report) to evaluate Incyte’s investigational selective IDO1 enzyme inhibitor, epacadostat, in combination with Imfinzi, compared to Imfinzi alone in early lung cancer.Regional PerformanceProduct sales declined 10% to $1.39 billion, primarily due to generic competition for Crestor and Seroquel XR and pricing pressure for Symbicort in the United States. European markets witnessed an 8% decline in sales to $1.19 billion. Revenues from Emerging Markets were up 10% to $1.52 billion primarily on the back of strong growth in China (up 14% to $723 million). In Established ROW market, sales were flat at $793 million.Other DetailsAstraZeneca’s core gross margin declined 400 basis points (bps) to 79.6%. Core selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses rose 4% to $1.95 billion.In the quarter, core research and development (R&D) expenses were flat at $1.34 billion.2017 OutlookWhile AstraZeneca retained its previously issued sales outlook for 2017, it slightly refined the core earnings guidance.AstraZeneca continues to expect total revenue to decline in the low-to-mid single-digit percentage range in 2017. However core earnings in 2017 are expected toward the favorable end of the previously issued guidance of a decline in low-to-mid teen percentage. Based on the average exchange rates in the first half, currency movements are still expected to adversely impact the top line by a low single-digit percentage but minimally impact core EPS.Our TakeThough AstraZeneca’s third-quarter performance was mixed, shares rose around 1.4% in pre-market trading on Thursday as the company brightened its 2017 earnings outlook. Moreover, the company has announced quite a few positive developments on the regulatory and pipeline front so far this year. The latest such development is the accelerated approval of Calquence for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma, an aggressive form of blood cancer, last month.Backed by the positive news flow, so far this year, AstraZeneca’s shares have gained 22%, comparing favorably with the industry’s growth of 14.8%. Astrazeneca PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Astrazeneca PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Astrazeneca PLC QuoteAstraZeneca currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

258,INCY,"Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) reported strong results for the third quarter of 2017, wherein both earnings and sales topped estimates.Incyte reported earnings of 17 cents per share beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 6 cents but lower than the year-ago quarter reported figure of 19 cents.Quarterly revenues were $381.5 million, up 41.6% year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $360.2 million. The top line was driven by higher sales of Jakafi in the United States and Iclusig in Europe as well as royalties from sales of Jakavi and Olumiant outside the United States. Incyte’s shares have moved up 13% in the year so far, compared with the industry’s 4.8% gain.Quarter in DetailJakafi sales grew 36%, year over year to $304 million driven by strong patient demand for both indications. Net product revenue of Iclusig amounted to $18 million, up from $13 million in the year-ago quarter. Product royalty revenues from Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) for the commercialization of Jakafi in ex-U.S. markets grew 36.7% to $41 million.Research and development (R&D) expenses were up to $270 million from $143 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to the expansion of the portfolio as well as upfront and milestone expenses of $209 million related to collaboration and license agreements. Selling, general and administration (SG&A) expenses amounted to $91 million, up 19.7% year over year.2017 Outlook UpdatedBased on strong performance so far in 2017, the company upped guidance for Jakafi and now expects revenues in the range of $1,125-$1,135 million, up from the earlier projected range of $1,090-$1,120 million. Iclusig revenues are still expected in the range of $60-$65 million.R&D expenses are now expected in the range of $1,250-1,300 million, up from the earlier forecast of $1,050-1,150 billion due to the acceleration of the phase III plans for epacadostat. SG&A expenses are still expected in the range of $340-$360 million.Incyte Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Incyte Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Incyte Corporation QuotePipeline UpdateResults from a phase III trial, REACH3 evaluating Jakafi as a treatment for patients with steroid-refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is expected in the first half of 2018. Assuming positive results, Incyte plans to submit a sNDA seeking accelerated approval of Jakafi in this indication in 2018. A phase III trial, GRAVITAS-301, on itacitinib, in patients with treatment-naïve acute GVHD, was initiated in July.The phase III trial, ECHO-301, evaluating epacadostat plus Keytruda in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma is now fully-recruited and data are expected in the first half of 2018.The European Commission approved Olumiant in February 2017 for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. The drug was approved in Japan too. However, the company suffered a setback when the FDA issued a complete response letter for Olumiant seeking additional clinical data to determine appropriate dosage.The FDA further stated that additional data are necessary to further characterize safety concerns across treatment arms. In August 2017, partner Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) announced that the NDA will be submitted before January 2018, earlier than anticipated.Concurrent with the third-quarter results, Incyte announced expansion of its collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca PLC’s (AZN  -  Free Report) global biologics research and development arm, MedImmune. Both companies will evaluate the efficacy and safety of epacadostat in combination with AstraZeneca’s Imfinzi (durvalumab), a human monoclonal antibody directed against PD-L1, compared to Imfinzi alone.The two companies will conduct a phase III trial in patients with locally-advanced (Stage III), unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease has not progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy concurrent with radiation therapy (CRT). The trial is expected to begin in the first half of 2018 and costs will be shared.Our TakeIncyte beat both on earnings and sales in the third quarter on strong Jakafi performance. Jakafi sales were driven by patient demand. The increase in sales guidance was also encouraging. Inclusig also performed well and exceeded expectations.Going forward, the label expansion of Jakafi for GVHD will further boost sales. Meanwhile, partner Lilly plans to resubmit NDA for Olumiant earlier than expected. A potential approval will further boost the top-line.Zacks RankIncyte currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

259,INCY,"The fourth-quarter earnings season has crossed the half way mark, and the results so far reflect a positive trend, with an above average proportion of companies beating both top- and bottom-line expectations. Per the latest Earnings Trend, total earnings for the medical sector are up 16.9% from the same period last year on 8.5% higher revenues so far.The biotech stocks had a fairly good run in 2017 despite the prevalence of headwinds like rising competition, pipeline setbacks, slowdown in growth of mature products and generic competition for certain key drugs. While some of these issues still persist, most companies seem to have combatted the pressure courtesy of new drug approvals and upbeat performance of many blockbuster drugs.  We note that the slowdown in mature products compelled prominent biotechs to acquire smaller ones with promising pipelines. Gilead Sciences (GILD) acquired Kite Pharma and subsequently obtained FDA approval of Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), the latter’s chimeric CAR-T therapy candidate. Celgene recently announced plans to acquire Juno Therapeutics for $87 per share in cash, or a total of approximately $9 billion, net of cash and marketable securities acquired.Picking the Prospective Winners for the SeasonThere are a number of biotech companies which are likely to trump fourth-quarter estimates. However, with a wide range of biotech firms thronging the investment space, it is by no means an easy task for investors to arrive at stocks that have the potential to deliver better-than-expected earnings.With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have zeroed in on five biotech stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and have a positive Earnings ESP. Earnings ESP is a very valuable tool for investors looking for stocks that are most likely to beat earnings estimates. Moreover, adding a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 has delivered a positive surprise 70% of the time. While you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here, you can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Bet on These 5 Stocks for Higher ReturnsSan Francisco, CA-based Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing small-molecule therapies for the treatment of cancer. Exelixis' lead drug Cabometyx continues to gain traction. The recent FDA approval of Cabometyx for the treatment previously untreated advanced RCC should further boost demand. The drug performed impressively against widely used Sutent. We expect Cabometyx will pose a challenge to Sutent’s market share for first line RCC in 2018.  Exelixis’ track record is outstanding. The company has surpassed expectations in the trailing four quarters, with an average of 543.6%. The company which is scheduled to report results on Feb 26, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +21.98%.Dublin, Ireland-based Alkermes plc (ALKS  -  Free Report) has a diversified product portfolio and a promising pipeline of candidates targeting major central nervous system disorders including schizophrenia, depression, addiction and multiple sclerosis. The company generates revenues from its proprietary products Vivitrol and Aristada, and the five partnered products — Risperdal Consta, Invega Sustenna/Xeplion, Invega Trinza/Trevicta, Ampyra/Fampyra and Bydureon. We expect these products to continue contributing to the company’s top-line growth in the coming quarters. Moreover, the pipeline progress has been encouraging too. The company recently submitted a NDA to the FDA for its pipeline candidate, ALKS 5461 for the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder.  The company has a decent track record with an average positive surprise of 75.0%. Alkermes currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +34.12%.Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ANTH  -  Free Report), a biopharmaceutical company, is focused on developing drugs to treat serious and life-threatening diseases such as exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and B-cell associated renal diseases. The company currently has two compounds in development, Sollpura and blisibimod.  The company licensed Sollpura from Eli Lilly & Co in July 2014.  Sollpura is a novel non-porcine investigational Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy for the treatment of Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency (“EPI”), often seen in patients with cystic fibrosis and other conditions.  Blisibimod was licensed from Amgen and targets B-cell activating factor, or BAFF, which has been shown to be elevated in a variety of B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases, including Immunoglobulin A nephropathy. After having suffered a setback, the company recently reported encouraging data from a phase III study, RESULT, on Sollpura for the treatment of EPI. With a decent track record, the company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +20.47%.Based in New Haven, CT, Alexion Pharmaceuticals’ (ALXN  -  Free Report) key growth driver, Soliris, is approved for the treatment of two severe and ultra-rare disorders resulting from chronic uncontrolled activation of the complement component of the immune system — paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. The label expansion of the drug along with geographic expansion will further boost sales. Among new products, while Strensiq is gaining momentum, the company redefined its strategy for Kanuma which earlier lagged expectations. Alexion’s track record is excellent as it has consistently topped estimates in the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 11.91%. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +8.92%. Alexion is scheduled to report results on Feb 8.Wilmington, DE-based Incyte Corporation’s (INCY  -  Free Report) Jakafi is a first-in-class JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, approved in the United State for the treatment of patients with polycythemia vera (“PV”), who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to hydroxyurea. It is also approved for the treatment of patients with intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis (“MF”), including primary MF, post-PV MF, and post-essential thrombocythemia MF.  Jakafi sales are being driven by patient demand. Inclusig also continues to perform well and exceeded expectations.  The label expansion of Jakafi for graft-versus-host disease will further boost sales. The company has an encouraging track record with an average positive surprise of 42.9%. Incyte currently carries a Zacks Rank 3 and an Earnings ESP of +5.57%. The company is scheduled to release results on Feb 15.Bottom Line  Challenges in the form of competitive and pricing pressure will remain. However, a number of companies in the healthcare space have fared well. Picking some outperformers from the space, backed by a solid Zacks Rank and a positive Earnings ESP, could lead investors to gain this earnings season.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

260,INCY,"Merck and Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) gained priority review for yet another supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) for its PD-1 inhibitor, Keytruda. With the latest application, Merck is looking to get Keytruda approved in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is a difficult-to-treat lung cancer patient population. The FDA granted priority review to this sBLA with a decision scheduled on Oct 30.The sBLA filing was based on data from the KEYNOTE-407 study. At the recently concluded annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, data presentation from this pivotal lung cancer study resulted in Merck emerging as a winner at this annual key cancer event. Data from the study showed that the combination of Keytruda plus chemotherapy led to significant improvement in both overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival regardless of PD-L1 expression. PD-L1 is a protein present on the surface of cells.The risk of death (OS) was reduced by 36% compared to chemotherapy alone. The PFS improvement or as we say reduction in the risk of progression or death was nearly half for patients in the Keytruda combination group compared with chemotherapy alone.The data was termed “practice changing” by CNBC – changing the way doctors look at prescribing these drugs to cancer patients. It further cemented Merck’s position in the lung cancer market, which is the most lucrative oncology sector.This year so far, Merck’s shares have risen 7.4% against the industry’s decline of 5.1%.In a short span of time, Keytruda has become Merck’s largest product. It is already approved for use in 10 different settings involving seven different tumor types. This year, it has already gained approval for two new indications. These include third-line treatment of adult as well as pediatric patients with primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and second-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. These label expansion approvals should drive sales of Keytruda in the future quarters.The treatment generated sales of $1.5 billion in first-quarter 2018, up 12.9% sequentially and 151% year over year. This upside was driven by the global launch for new indications, which further boosted demand.  Keytruda sales are gaining, particularly from strong momentum in the first-line lung cancer indication. In fact, Keytruda is the only anti-PD-1 approved in the first-line setting for certain lung cancer patients both as a monotherapy as well as a combination therapy with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drug, Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo).Keytruda is also being studied for more than 30 types of cancer in more than 700 studies, including in excess of 400 combination studies. Merck is collaborating with several companies including Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), Incyte (INCY  -  Free Report), Glaxo and Pfizer separately for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens.Merck has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

261,INCY,"The biotech sector was in focus with regular pipeline updates. The key stories include bigwig Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) getting approval for its HIV drug Biktarvy in Europe and Puma Biotechnology (PBYI  -  Free Report) soaring on positive CHMP recommendation, while Merrimack (MACK  -  Free Report) plunged on the failure of its phase II study in pancreatic cancer.Recap of Important StoriesGilead’s Biktarvy Gets EC Approval: Gilead announced that the European Commission has granted Marketing Authorization to HIV combination therapy Biktarvy (bictegravir 50mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg; BIC/FTC/TAF). Biktarvy is approved as a once-daily single tablet regimen (STR) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults without present or past evidence of viral resistance to the integrase class, emtricitabine or tenofovir.The approval was supported by positive data from four ongoing phase III studies, namely Studies 1489 and 1490 in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults, and Studies 1844 and 1878 in virologically suppressed adults. With this approval, BIC/FTC/TAF becomes Gilead’s third FTC/TAF-based STR approved in the European Union in three years. BIC/FTC/TAF met its primary objective at 48 weeks in all four studies.The regimen was earlier approved by the FDA in February 2018. The approval in Europe will further strengthen the company’s HIV franchise. (Read more: Gilead's Biktarvy Gets EC Nod for HIV- 1 Infection)Merrimack Plunges on Study Failure:  Shares of Merrimack plunged after the company reported disappointing results from the phase II study in front-line metastatic pancreatic cancer. The phase II trial, CARRIE, evaluated the addition of MM-141 to standard-of-care treatment in patients with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer and high serum levels of free Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1).  The primary endpoint of the study was progression-free survival, while secondary endpoints included objective response rate, disease control rate, duration of response, and overall survival and safety.Merrimack reported that the study did not meet its primary or secondary efficacy endpoints in patients, who received MM-141 in combination with nab-paclitaxel and Gemzar, compared with nab-paclitaxel and Gemzar alone. Subsequently, Merrimack has terminated the development of MM-141. With the sale of Onivyde, the company was back to being a development-stage biopharmaceutical company and was banking on its three pipeline candidates to boost its growth prospects. Hence, the failure of the CARRIE study came as a huge disappointment for its investors, given the limited number of candidates in the pipeline. Consequently, the company now plans to focus on the other two candidates in its pipeline, MM-121 and MM-310. (Read more: Merrimack Crashes as Phase II Pancreatic Cancer Study Fails)Amgen's Presents Encouraging Data on Repatha: Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced encouraging data from the phase III study, BANTING, which showed that its PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha, significantly reduced bad cholesterol in patients, with type II diabetes and hypercholesterolemia, who have already undergone moderate/high-intensity statin therapy. The study evaluated monthly subcutaneous administration of a 420 mg dose of Repatha over a period of 12 weeks in patients with type II diabetes and hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia, who are on optimized background statin therapy. The results from the study showed that the addition of Repatha to background statin therapy significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C).Data from the BANTING study also revealed that 84.5% of patients in the Repatha arm achieved LDL-C levels of less than 70 mg/dL, which is the recommended level by the American College of Clinical Endocrinologists for patients with type II diabetes compared with 15.4% of patients in placebo arm at week 12.

The MAA is seeking approval of the drug as extended adjuvant treatment of early-stage HER2-positive hormone receptor positive breast cancer. The news boosted investor sentiment as the CHMP had adopted a negative opinion on the MAA in February 2018. The positive opinion from the CHMP indicates an imminent tentative approval. The drug was approved by the FDA in July 2017 for the extended adjuvant treatment of adult patients with early-stage HER2-overexpressed/amplified breast cancer, following adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy.Incyte Announces Positive Results on Jakafi for GVHD: Incyte (INCY  -  Free Report) announced that the phase II trial, REACH1, evaluating lead drug Jakafi in combination with corticosteroids for the treatment of patients with steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), met its primary endpoint. The data from the study showed that Jakafi demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 55% at day 28.Moreover, the number of patients showing a response at any point of time, during the study, was 73%. Propelled by positive data from the REACH 1 study, Incyte now plans to file a Supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) with the FDA, for the label expansion of Jakafi, for the treatment of steroid-refractory acute GVHD, during the third quarter of 2018. A potential label expansion for GVHD should further boost sales.

262,INCY,"We expect biotech major Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results on Feb 1, after the market closes. Amgen delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.83% in the last quarter.Amgen shares are up 26.9% in the past year. This compares favorably with the 11.8% increase registered by the industry during this period.Amgen’s performance has been pretty impressive, with the company delivering positive surprises consistently. The average earnings beat over the last four quarters is 5.25%.Amgen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Amgen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Amgen Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Factors at PlayAmgen’s newer products like Prolia, Xgeva, Kyprolis, Vectibix and Blincyto are expected to deliver the goods backed by higher demand. However, sales of mature brands like Aranesp, Enbrel, Epogen, Neulasta and Neupogen are expected to be lower due to competitive pressure.Neulasta demand is being hurt by competition from PD-1s and other new cancer therapies. Neupogen sales are also being hurt by biosimilar competition in the United States mainly from Zarxio, Sandoz’s biosimilar version of NeupogenWe expect Neulasta and Neupogen sales to continue to be hurt by competitive dynamics in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, Neulasta and Epogen are expected to start facing biosimilar competition in the United States this year.Enbrel sales are expected to continue to be hurt by increased pricing and competitive pressures. Enbrel is one of the main drivers of Amgen’s revenues. The company launched Enbrel Mini with AutoTouch, a new auto injector device for Enbrel in the United States in November, which is likely to provide some support to fourth-quarter sales.Meanwhile, operating expenses are expected to be higher in the fourth quarter than the prior quarter, reflecting the typical pattern of the business as well as costs related to recovery efforts following Hurricane Maria. Amgen expects to record $75 million to $100 million in expenses related to Hurricane Maria recovery efforts in the fourth quarter, which will reduce earnings per share by 8-11 cents.Investor focus on the call will be on management’s comments about the initial impact of inclusion of cardiovascular outcomes data on the label of its PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha. In December 2017, Amgen gained FDA approval to include a new indication - risk reduction of major cardiovascular events data – on Repatha’s label based on data from the phase III cardiovascular outcomes study (FOURIER). This makes Repatha the first PCSK9 inhibitor to prevent heart attacks, strokes and coronary revascularizations in adults with established cardiovascular disease. With the cardiovascular indication approved to be included in Repatha’s label, Amgen believes that patient access to Repatha should improve. Please note that uptake of Repatha, which gained FDA approval in August 2015, has not been very encouraging so far due to pricing and re-imbursement issues/payer restrictions.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Amgen is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate ($3.06 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($3.04 per share) is +0.55%.

263,INCY,"Merus N.V. (MRUS  -  Free Report) announced that it has initiated a phase II study to evaluate its most advanced bispecific antibody candidate, MCLA-128, in patients with metastatic breast cancer (“MBC”).The study comprises two cohorts. The first cohort will evaluate a combination of MCLA-128, Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Herceptin and chemotherapy in MBC patients who are HER2-positive and their disease have progressed after treating with anti-HER2 therapies. The second cohort will evaluate MCLA-128 in combination with endocrine therapy in patients with HR+/HER2-low MBC and whose disease has progressed after treatment with hormone therapies and CDK4/6 inhibitors.Merus’ shares have increased 15% in the past six months, comparing favorably with the industry’s gain of 2.5% in that period.Data from pre-clinical study demonstrated that the candidate has shown synergy with Herceptin in blocking heregulin-driven tumor cell growth and blocking of signaling through the HER3 pathway with endocrine therapy as well.The primary endpoint of the study is to achieve clinical benefit (Complete Response, Partial Response or Stable Disease) at 24-weeks in both the arms. The study will also evaluate progression free survival, overall survival, duration of response and overall response rate among others as its secondary endpoints.The company is also developing MCLA-128 in early stage studies as a treatment for gastric, ovarian, endometrial and NSCL cancers. Apart from MCLA-128, Merus is also developing another bispecific antibody candidate, MCLA-117, in acute myeloid leukemia.However, the breast cancer segment is getting lot interest from other large as well as small cap pharma companies. We note that earlier this month, the FDA approved line extension of AstraZeneca’s (AZN  -  Free Report) PARP inhibitor, Lynparza, to include MBC.Merus has no approved product in its portfolio.

The deal terms included upfront payments of $100 million as well as future potential development and sales milestone payments of up to $745 million, plus tiered royalties on product sales.According to Voyager, Sanofi decided to exit the deal as the option did not include rights in the United States. With Voyager gaining global rights to the VY-AADC program for advanced Parkinson’s disease, the company said that it remains on track to dose the first patient during the second quarter of 2018.GW Finishes Rolling Drug Submission for Epilepsy Drug: GW Pharmaceuticals plc (GWPH  -  Free Report) announced that it has completed the rolling submission of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) in the United States for Epidiolex (cannabidiol) as adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (“LGS”) and Dravet syndrome.

Meanwhile, sales of blockbuster drug Enbrel will continue to decline in the quarter due to biosimilar competition. The lower sales trend in Prevnar/Prevenar 13 vaccines franchise is likely to continue as well. Sales of Viagra are expected to be affected by lower demand.

266,INCY,"Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ICPT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 1, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company reported a narrower-than-expected loss. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Intercept’s stock has declined 43.4% year to date against the industry’s gain of 5.3%.  In particular, shares have plunged significantly over the last few days due to safety issues regarding the approved drug Ocaliva.Surprise HistoryIntercept’s track record is pretty mixed, with the company reporting a narrower-than-expected loss in three of the last four quarters and wider-than-anticipated loss in one. The company has posted an average negative earnings surprise of 2.96% over this period.Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise   Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayIntercept received a major boost with the FDA’s approval (in May 2016) of its lead drug, Ocaliva, in combination with ursodeoxycholic (UDCA), for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA or as monotherapy in adults unable to bear with UDCA. In December 2016, the European Commission also granted conditional approval to Ocaliva for the same indication.The initial uptake of Ocaliva has been encouraging. However, there has been a lot of turmoil regarding the drug’s safety.The dose recommended for earlier stage PBC patients with no or mild hepatic impairment was 5 mg once daily, which was increased after three months to 10 mg once daily based on tolerability and treatment response. On the other hand, in late-stage patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B or C cirrhosis), recommended dosing starts at 5 mg once weekly, with the possibility to gradually increase to a maximum of 10 mg twice weekly.However, there have been a few safety issues. Deaths have been reported in PBC patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B or C cirrhosis). The FDA reported 19 deaths due to Ocaliva and stated that the drug may also affect the liver.However, Intercept conducted an analysis and concluded that that these patients were prescribed once daily doses of Ocaliva, which is seven times higher than the recommended weekly dose. The analysis was conducted in consultation with the FDA. The company concluded that deaths occurred due to the overdosing of the drug.Consequently, Intercept issued the Dear Healthcare Provider letter. Thereafter, the FDA issued their own safety communication to reinforce recommended label dosing. Intercept is also working with the FDA on further updates to Ocaliva’s label for safety purposes.Nevertheless, such side-effects will limit the sales potential.Meanwhile, Ocaliva is being evaluated for other indications including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). The company has initiated a phase III study (REGENERATE) on Ocaliva for the treatment of non-cirrhotic NASH in patients with advanced liver fibrosis. Enrolment for the interim analysis cohort in the REGENERATE trial was completed (data readout in the first half of 2019).Meanwhile, Intercept also initiated a phase II study, CONTROL (Combination OCA aNd sTatins for monitoRing Of Lipids), on OCA. The study is being conducted to evaluate the effect of Ocaliva in combination with statin therapy on lipid metabolism in patients with NASH.Intercept expects operating expenses to be in the range of $380-$420 million in 2017.The company believes that continued commercialization of Ocaliva in PBC in the United States and other markets, sustained clinical development for OCA in PBC and NASH and the continued advancement of INT-767 and other pipeline programs are likely to drive growth.We expect investors to remain focused on sales ramp up of Ocaliva and pipeline updates during the third-quarter earnings call.Earnings WhispersOur proven model doesn’t conclusively show that Intercept is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat earnings. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -2.39%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at a loss of $3.63 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of $3.55. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Intercept currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 which when combined with a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Clovis Oncology, Inc.

The company has surpassed expectations in the trailing four quarters, with an average of 543.6%. Exelixis’ share price has increased 15.7% in the last six months compared with the industry’s loss of 0.1%.Factors Likely to Impact ResultsExelixis received a major boost with the FDA’s approval of Cabometyx tablets in April 2016 for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).The drug’s uptake was encouraging and is expected to propel the top line in the forthcoming quarters. Moreover, Cabometyx was also approved in the EU.New patient starts, refills for patients already on therapy and continued expansion of the prescriber base for Cabometyx are driving the drug’s sales. Meanwhile, Exelixis is developing cabozantinib in a broad development program and has submitted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for advanced RCC. The FDA assigned a PDUFA action date of Feb 15, 2018. A potential label expansion of Cabometyx will significantly boost the growth prospects.During the first quarter, Exelixis inked agreements with The Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) and Roche Holding AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) to develop abozantinib in combination with immunotherapy agents. Exelixis and Bristol-Myers initiated a phase III trial, CheckMate 9ER, in July.Exelixis also initiated the dose-escalation stage of a phase Ib trial of cabozantinib in combination with Tecentriq. The drug will be evaluated in patients suffering from locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) or RCC.These collaborations allow Exelixis to earn milestone payments and royalties that boost its top line.However, expenses continue to increase. Exelixis expects total costs and operating expenses for 2017 in the range of $290-$310 million.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Exelixis is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) to be able to beat earnings. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -10.82% since the Most Accurate is 7 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 8 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Exelixis carries a Zacks Rank #2 which is favorable.

268,INCY,"Radius Health, Inc. (RDUS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 2.  Radius’ share price has decreased 22% year to date compared with the industry’s 6.6% decline.Radius Health has a disappointing track record so far. The company reported wider-than-expected loss in three of the four trailing quarters with a negative average surprise of 6.9%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors at PlayRadius focuses on the development of therapeutics for the treatment of osteoporosis, oncology and endocrine diseases.The company’s lead drug, Tymlos, was approved in the United States in April. The drug was approved for treating postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture defined as history of osteoporotic fracture and multiple risk factors for fracture. The drug can also be used for patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapies.The company reported sales of Tymlos of $1.0 million from the first four weeks of launch.  The company is moving ahead with its plans in contracting with managed care organizations with access to over 133 million covered lives across Commercial and Medicare Part D plans.Hence, we expect investors to focus on the uptake of the drug during the upcoming earnings call.Although the osteoporosis market in the United States has great potential as approximately 1.4 million postmenopausal women experience osteoporotic fractures each year, Tymlos is expected to face significant competition from Eli Lilly &Co's (LLY  -  Free Report) Forteo and Amgen. Inc’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Prolia.Meanwhile, the company’s Marketing Authorisation Application for Eladynos (abaloparatide-SC) in Europe for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis was under review.  However, the company suffered a setback when the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency issued a second Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues and requested additional data analyses related to the safety and efficacy of abaloparatide-SC. Consequently, Radius is working with the CHMP to address these issues and the company expects a response for Eladynos prior to the end of 2017.In May, Radius Health announced positive top-line results from the completed 24-month ACTIVExtend clinical trial on Tymlos, which met all of its primary and secondary endpoints. The company expects to submit a sNDA to the FDA in connection with the ACTIVExtend results by year end.The FDA granted Fast Track designation to pipeline candidate elacestrant, an experimental selective estrogen receptor down-regulator/degrader for the treatment of women with ER+ and HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The elacestrant clinical development program is currently ongoing with two phase I studies in patients with ER+, HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have been heavily pre-treated (median of three prior lines of therapy) and have evaluable disease.Hence, we expect the management to throw light on pipeline progress.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Radius is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Radius Health is currently pegged at 0.00%.

269,INCY,"Investors possessing the skill to distinguish between overpriced toxic stocks and the fairly priced ones emerge winners at the end. However, identifying these two categories of stocks is not easy as these are intertwined in the market place in a complicated way. Investors who can precisely identify toxic stocks and discard them at the right time are most likely to benefit.Usually, the overhyped toxic stocks are vulnerable to external shocks and are burdened with huge amount of debts. Moreover, the price of the toxic stocks is unreasonably inflated. The unrealistically high price of toxic stocks is only transitory in nature as the intrinsic value of the toxic stocks is lower than the current bloated price.The overblown price of toxic stocks can be ascribed to either an irrational exuberance associated with them or some fundamental problems associated with the stock. Owning such stocks for a long stretch of time is detrimental for investors and may result in huge loss of wealth.On the other side, investors may gain from the precise identification of toxic stocks with the aid of an investing strategy known as short selling. This strategy allows them to sell a stock first and then buy it when the price falls.While short selling excels in bear markets, it typically loses money in bull markets.So, identifying toxic stocks and abandoning them at the right time is the key to guard your portfolio from big losses. Profits can be made by short selling them.Screening CriteriaHere is a winning strategy that will help you to identify overpriced toxic stocks:Most recent Debt/Equity Ratio greater than the median industry average: High debt/equity ratio implies high leverage. High leverage indicates a huge level of repayment that the company has to make in connection with the debt amount.P/E using 12-month forward EPS estimate greater than 50: A very high forward P/E implies that a stock is highly overvalued.% Change in F (1) and F (2) Estimate (12 Weeks) less than -5: Negative EPS estimate revision for this and the next fiscal year during the past 12 weeks points to analysts’ pessimism.Zacks Rank more than or equal to #3 (Hold): We have not considered Buy-rated stocks that generally outperform the market.Here are five of the 21 toxic stocks that showed up on the screen:Wilmington, DE-based Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) is a drug discovery company.

270,INCY,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Incyteis seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for INCY in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 8 cents per share for INCY, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 5 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for INCY, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +40.11% heading into earnings season. Why is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that INCY has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Incyte, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

271,INCY,"We expect Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results on Jan 31, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.94%.Lilly’s shares have risen 16.6% in the past year while the industry recorded an increase of 29%.Lilly’s earnings performance has been modest with earnings missing expectations in three of the last four quarters while beating the same in the remaining one, bringing the average positive surprise to 1.68%.Eli Lilly and Company Price and EPS Surprise  Eli Lilly and Company Price and EPS Surprise | Eli Lilly and Company QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors to ConsiderLike the previous couple of quarters, strong uptake of new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Cyramza, Jardiance and Lartruvo is likely to make up for the decline in sales of established products like Zyprexa, Alimta, Cialis, Strattera and Effient.While Trulicity sales are likely to benefit from growth in GLP-1 and market share gains, Jardiance sales are expected to be driven by increased market share within the growing SGLT2 class.Continued strong uptake outside the United States will continue to drive sales of Cyramza. Strong launch uptake is likely to drive sales of Basaglar, Taltz and Lartruvo. Please note that Taltz was approved for a new indication - active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) – in December 2017 - which can bring in some additional sales in the fourth quarter.Meanwhile, the loss of exclusivity for Alimta, Cymbalta, Strattera, Effient, Axiron, Zyprexa, and Evista will continue to hurt volumes. Also, lower demand in the United States due to competitive pressure mainly from immuno-oncology agents is hurting Alimta sales in the country – a trend which is likely to be reflected fourth-quarter results.Another new drug, Olumiant (baricitinib) was launched in select European countries and in Japan last year while it is under review in the United States. In the third quarter, strong launch uptake in Germany led to better sales of the drug. This trend is likely to be reflected in the soon-to-be reported quarter’s results. Lilly and partner Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) plan to re-submit the new drug application (NDA) for Olumiant in United States by this month.Some older products like Humalog, Trajenta and Forteo are also expected to do well.Animal segment sales were hurt by global competitive pressure in the first three quarters of 2017 - a trend we are likely to see this time around as well. On the third-quarter conference call, management had said that it is exploring strategic alternatives for this business including a sale, merger or creating a separate company through an initial public offer. A decision regarding the same is expected to be made no later than the middle of this year, the company then said, and Lilly may ultimately opt to retain the business. Investors may look for an update related to the same on the Q4 conference call.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Lilly is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is +0.47%. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Lilly has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Lilly’s Zacks Rank #3 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other large-cap health care stocks worth considering per our model. These have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.06% and a Zacks Rank of 3. The company is scheduled to report fourth quarter earnings on Feb 2.

272,INCY,"The secret behind successful investing is the proper identification of overhyped toxic stocks and the correctly priced ones. However, it is not easy to accurately pinpoint toxic stocks and abandon them at the right time to make some gains at the end.Overblown toxic stocks are usually susceptible to outside shocks and loaded with a huge amount of debt. Also, the price of toxic stocks is unrealistically high. However, the inflated price of the toxic stocks is only short-lived as it is higher than its intrinsic value.The unreasonably inflated price of toxic stocks can be due to either an irrational exuberance associated with them or some serious fundamental drawbacks inherent in the stock. Owning such bloated stocks for a long stretch of time can be harmful to investors and may result in huge loss of wealth.Investors may gain from the correct identification of toxic stocks with the help of an investing strategy known as short selling. This strategy allows them to sell a stock first and then buy it when the price falls.While short selling excels in bear markets, it typically loses money in bull markets.So, identifying toxic stocks and discarding them at the right time is the key to protect your portfolio from big losses. Profits can be made by short selling them.Screening CriteriaHere is a winning strategy that will help you to identify overpriced toxic stocks:Most recent Debt/Equity Ratio greater than the median industry average: High debt/equity ratio implies high leverage. High leverage indicates a huge level of repayment that the company has to make in connection with the debt amount.P/E using 12-month forward EPS estimate greater than 50: A very high forward P/E implies that a stock is highly overvalued.% Change in F (1) and F (2) Estimate (12 Weeks) less than -5: Negative EPS estimate revision for this and the next fiscal year during the past 12 weeks points to analysts’ pessimism.Zacks Rank more than or equal to #3 (Hold): We have not considered Buy-rated stocks that generally outperform the market.Here are four of the 16 toxic stocks that showed up on the screen:Covanta Holding Corporation (CVA  -  Free Report) is a Morristown, NJ-based alternative energy company that provides waste and energy services in the United States and Canada. In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter remained unchanged at 20 cents per share.  The company has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Bethpage, NY-based Altice USA, Inc. (ATUS  -  Free Report) is a leading broadband communications and video services provider in the United States. In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has changed from earnings of a penny to a loss of a penny.

273,INCY,"Acquisitions once again remained in focus this week with Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) rumored to be in talks with Juno  regarding a possible deal.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesJuno Soars on Acquisition Rumors: Juno’s shares skyrocketed on reports that Celgene is interested in acquiring the immuno-oncology focused company. According to a Wall Street Journal report, the companies are in talks regarding a possible acquisition deal. If the Juno acquisition rumors turn out to be true, this will be the second acquisition announcement to be made by Celgene this year. Just last week, the company announced its intention to acquire Impact Biomedicines, which is developing fedratinib for myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera.Celgene is under a lot of pressure to strengthen its pipeline and revenue stream - the company had a tough 2017 with issues like pipeline setbacks as well as the weak performance of Otezla weighing on the stock.However, it remains to be seen how much Celgene will be willing to shell out for Juno. Juno’s market cap as of Jan 16, 2018 was $5.2 billion. Juno’s shares have been on an upward trend following the $11.9 billion Gilead-Kite acquisition announcement last year in August. With Juno being focused on the development of innovative cellular immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer, the company has long been considered a potential acquisition target. Over the last one year, Juno’s shares are up 139% compared to the 3.3% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to.Juno’s cell-based cancer immunotherapies are based on chimeric antigen receptor and high-affinity T cell receptor technologies. The company has several cell-based candidates in its pipeline targeting a variety of B-cell malignancies as well as multiple solid tumors and multiple myeloma. Although Juno suffered a major setback with the development of its erstwhile lead pipeline candidate due to safety issues (including patient deaths), the company is now focusing on liso-cel, a next-generation CAR-T cell product that targets CD19. Juno expects to file for FDA approval of liso-cel for relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”) in the second half of 2018. With the immuno-oncology space remaining quite lucrative, Celgene may have to pay a hefty premium to finalize the deal. Juno and Celgene already have a collaboration deal in place.Concert Down on Patent Challenge Update: Concert Pharmaceuticals (CNCE  -  Free Report) suffered a major blow with its Post Grant Review (“PGR”) petition challenging the validity of U.S. Patent No. 9,662,335 being rejected by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Concert had filed the petition last year in July challenging the validity of the patent that has been assigned to Incyte Pharmaceuticals (INCY  -  Free Report). The concerned patent covers deuterated ruxolitinib analogs while Concert’s CTP-543 is a deuterium-modified version of ruxolitinib. Incyte markets ruxolitinib in the United States under the name Jakafi and has patents covering ruxolitinib that may be unexpired if and when Concert seeks marketing approval for CTP-543.Despite the setback, Concert said that it can always challenge the validity of the patent later in federal court. Moreover, the company said that the decision does not affect its plans to develop CTP-543 for alopecia areata. However, the company is now reassessing its plans for developing CTP-543 for additional indications.CTP-543 is a novel JAK inhibitor currently in phase II development for alopecia areata. The FDA recently granted fast track status to the candidate for this indication (Read more: Concert Pharmaceuticals Plunges on Patent Petition Setback).Vertex’s Orkambi Label Expanded in EU: Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX  -  Free Report) gained EU approval for the use of Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) in children with cystic fibrosis (“CF”) in the 6-11 years age group with two copies of the F508del mutation. About 3,400 children in Europe belong to this category. Approval was in-line with expectations considering the company had got a positive opinion from the European Union Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) for this indication in November 2017 (Read more: Vertex's Cystic Fibrosis Drug Ok'd for Pediatric Use in EU). Vertex is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Humira Biosimilar BLA Accepted by FDA: The FDA has accepted for review a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) submitted by Sandoz for its biosimilar version of AbbVie’s blockbuster drug, Humira (adalimumab). Humira is approved for a wide range of indications. At a recent healthcare conference, AbbVie said that global Humira sales crossed $18 billion in 2017 and should approach $21 billion in 2020. The company, which expects the drug to lose exclusivity in international markets in the fourth quarter of 2018, believes that sales erosion will be manageable.  We note that Sandoz is not the first to file for a biosimilar version of Humira. In fact, companies like Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Boehringer Ingelheim have already gained approval for their Humira biosimilars. Amgen, which entered into a global settlement and license agreement with AbbVie, expects to launch its Humira biosimilar in Europe in October 2018 and in the United States in January 2023. Meanwhile, AbbVie and Boehringer are engaged in patent litigation in the United States.Eiger Plunges on Pipeline Setback: Eiger suffered a major setback with its investigational treatment, ubenimex, for pulmonary arterial hypertension (“PAH”) failing to meet the primary endpoint in a mid-stage study. Based on this disappointing update, the company has decided to discontinue the development of ubenimex for PAH though it will continue to evaluate ubenimex for lymphedema. Ubenimex is in a mid-stage study for this indication with data expected in the second half of the year. The company’s shares were down 49.4% on the news.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index was up slightly over the last four trading sessions. Among major biotech stocks, Celgene declined 0.6% while Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) gained 2.8%.

275,INCY,"Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) announced that the phase II trial, REACH1, evaluating lead drug Jakafi in combination with corticosteroids for the treatment of patients with steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), met its primary endpoint.The data from the study showed that Jakafi demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 55% at day 28.Moreover, the number of patients achieving a response at any point of time, during the study, was 73%.Propelled by positive data from the REACH 1 study, Incyte now plans to file a Supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) with the FDA for the label expansion of Jakafi, for the treatment of steroid-refractory acute GVHD, during the third quarter of 2018.Incyte also plans to present full details from the study, at an upcoming scientific meeting.We note that Jakafi, a first-in-class JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, is already approved by the FDA for the treatment of people with polycythemia vera (PV), who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea.The drug is also indicated for the treatment of people with intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis (MF), including primary MF, post–polycythemia vera MF and post–essential thrombocythemia MF. Incyte has a collaboration agreement with Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) for Jakafi. While Jakafi is marketed by Incyte in the United States, it is marketed by Novartis outside the country.Jakafi’s performance has been impressive so far. In order to expand the patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug, the company is working on expanding the drug’s label, further. In October 2017, the FDA approved a label update of the drug to include the addition of new patient-reported outcome (PRO) data from the COMFORT-I study as well as updating the warning related to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.A potential label expansion for GVHD shall further boost sales.Incyte’s stock has lost 23.5% in the year so far compared with the industry’s 5.2% decline. Meanwhile, apart from the steroid-refractory acute GVHD study, the REACH trial program also includes the ongoing phase III studies in steroid-refractory acute GVHD (REACH2) and steroid-refractory chronic GVHD (REACH3), both in collaboration with Novartis. Data from the studies are expected in 2019.Incyte is also making efforts to develop other candidates and reduce its dependence on Jakafi.The FDA has recently approved the 2-mg dose of Olumiant (baricitinib), a once-daily oral medication for the treatment of adults with moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), who have had an inadequate response to one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor therapies. Incyte and Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) have a partnership for Olumiant.However, Incyte suffered a setback with epacadostat. The external Data Monitoring Committee (eDMC) review of the pivotal phase III study, ECHO-301, evaluating epacadostat in combination with Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, determined that the study did not meet the primary endpoint of improving progression-free survival in the overall population compared to pembrolizumab monotherapy.  Zacks RankIncyte currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

276,INCY,"AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced that its investigational oral JAK inhibitor, upadacitinib met all primary as well as secondary endpoints in the fifth phase III study from its SELECT program.The phase III study, SELECT-EARLY, evaluated the candidate for moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients who had not been previously treated with chemotherapy agent methotrexate (MTX) versus MTX monotherapy. The SELECT program evaluates more than 4,000 patients across six studies on RA.After 12 weeks of treatment, the ACR50 response (primary endpoint) was achieved in 52% of the patients receiving the 15 mg oral once-daily dose of upadacitinib and 56% of the patients taking the 30 mg dose versus 28% for patients receiving MTX.The second primary endpoint of clinical remission was achieved by 48% of the patients in the 15 mg dose arm and 50% in the 30 mg dose arm, at week 24, versus only 18% for MTX.Meanwhile, 76% and 77% of patients in the 15 mg and 30 mg dose arm, respectively achieved ACR20 response at week 12 versus 54% for MTX.The results clearly show that a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with upadacitinib in both doses achieved superior responses compared to MTX. This suggests that upadacitinib monotherapy has the potential to control progression of RA and reduce the risk of permanent bone and joint damage for MTX naive patients.AbbVie plans to submit regulatory applications for upadacitinib in rheumatoid arthritis in the second half of the year.Other than rheumatoid arthritis, upadacitinib is also being evaluated in late-stage studies for Crohn’s disease and psoriatic arthritis and mid-stage studies for atopic dermatitis, giant cell arteritis and ulcerative colitis.JAK inhibitors, also known as Janus kinase inhibitors, are emerging as a potential treatment option for RA, eczema and other inflammatory diseases. These medicines work by inhibiting the activity of one or more of the Janus kinase family of enzymesLast week, Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and partner Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) gained FDA approval for the lower dose of (2 mg) of their oral JAK inhibitor, Olumiant. While the FDA did not approve the higher dose (4 mg), the drug’s label was approved with a boxed warning stating risk of serious infections, malignancies and thrombosis. Olumiant is already marketed in Europe and Japan.

277,INCY,"Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) along with its partner Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved the 2 mg dose of Olumiant (baricitinib) for treating moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”). The once-daily oral JAK inhibitor is approved as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate for treating adult patients with inadequate response to tumor necrosis factor (“TNF”) inhibitor therapies.The approval in the United States was not much of a surprise considering that an FDA advisory committee had recommended approval of the lower dose of the drug in April. However, the 4 mg dose of the drug was not approved.Moreover, the drug’s label includes a boxed warning stating risk of serious infections, malignancies and thrombosis.The companies expect to launch the drug by the end of the second quarter. It will be available at a price 60% lower than the leading TNF inhibitors approved for RA, which includes AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira and Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel among others.We remind investors that the FDA had issued a Complete Response Letter in April 2017 for the new drug application seeking approval of Olumiant, requesting additional information to determine the most appropriate doses.Olumiant is already approved in Europe and Japan and generated sales of $32.2 million in the first quarter of 2018. The U.S. approval will further boost the sales of the drug.Lilly’s share price has increased 0.5% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 4.4%.The approval was based on data from RA-BEACON study, which evaluated Olumiant in combination with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs versus placebo. Data showed that 49% of the patients treated with Olumiant achieved improvement in the signs and symptoms of RA compared to placebo (27%).The companies will conduct a long-term safety study of Olumiant in RA patients as part of the approval.Following approval in the United States, Incyte is now eligible to receive a milestone payment of $100 million from Lilly, which it expects to record in full in the second quarter of 2018.Olumiant is also being evaluated in a late-stage study for the treatment of atopic dermatitis.Eli Lilly and Company Price  Eli Lilly and Company Price | Eli Lilly and Company QuoteLilly currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

278,INCY,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 10.2% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is INCY due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Incyte Incurs Loss in Q1, Revenues Miss EstimatesIncyte reported a net loss of 1 cent as against a net income of 14 cents in the year-ago quarter. Incyte had received a milestone payment in the year-ago quarter which boosted the bottom-line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was of an earnings of $0.08.Quarterly revenues were $382.2 million, up 30% year over year. The reported figure, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $382.9 million.The year-over-year growth was driven by higher sales of Jakafi.Quarter in DetailJakafi sales grew 25%, year over year to $313.7 million driven by strong patient demand. Net product revenues of Iclusig amounted to $20.7 million, up from $13.7 million in the year-ago quarter. Product royalty revenues from Novartis for the commercialization of Jakafi in ex-U.S. markets grew 41.4% to $41 million.R&D expenses were up to $266 million from $177 million in the year-ago quarter. SG&A expenses amounted to $109 million, up 39.7% year over year.2018 OutlookThe company continues to expect Jakafi revenues in the range of $1,350-$1,400 million. Iclusig revenues are expected in the range of $80-$85 million.R&D expenses are now expected in the range of $1,013-$1,108 million, down from $1,077-1,172 million. SG&A expenses are now expected in the range of $340-$355 million, down from the earlier expectation of $465-$480 million.Pipeline UpdateThe phase II trial, REACH1 trial evaluating Jakafi in patients with steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease (“GVHD”) has completed enrolment and results are expected in the first half of 2018. Incyte expects to submit sNDA seeking approval of Jakafi for this indication in the second half of 2018.Data from the trial evaluating INCB54828 in patients with cholangiocarcinoma are expected in second half of 2018.However, Incyte suffered a setback with epacadostat. The external Data Monitoring Committee (eDMC) review of the pivotal phase III study, ECHO-301, evaluating epacadostat in combination with Keytruda in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma determined that the study did not meet the primary endpoint of improving progression-free survival in the overall population compared to pembrolizumab monotherapy.  The phase III trial, ECHO-301 was evaluating epacadostat plus Merck’s Keytruda in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma study’s second primary endpoint of overall survival also was not expected to reach statistical significance. Consequently, based on the disappointing data and the recommendation of the eDMC, Incyte stopped the study to enable patients and their physicians to consider alternative therapeutic options. Incyte is also significantly downsizing the epacadostat development program.As a result, Incyte and its collaboration partners have decided that the two pivotal trials of epacadostat in combination with Keytruda in lung cancer (ECHO-305 and ECHO-306) will be converted into randomized phase II trials. Enrollment will be discontinued in the four additional pivotal trials of epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab.  The two pivotal trials of epacadostat in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo will be amended to enable patients and their physicians to consider alternative therapeutic options. The pivotal trial in combination with durvalumab in Stage 3 lung cancer will not be initiated.However, in April 2018, the FDA convened its Arthritis Advisory Committee to discuss the resubmission of the baricitinib NDA, which recommended approval of the 2mg dose of baricitinib as a once-daily oral medication for the treatment of moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis for adult patients who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate.While the Advisory Committee unanimously supported the efficacy of the 4mg dose of baricitinib, it did not recommend approval of the 4mg dose of baricitinib for the proposed indication based on the adequacy of the safety and benefit-risk profiles. The FDA action date for baricitinib is in June 2018.The European Commission has already approved baricitinib as Olumiant in February 2017 for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to or are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been two revisions higher for the current quarter.Incyte Corporation Price and Consensus Incyte Corporation Price and Consensus | Incyte Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, INCY has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with a D. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.The company's stock is suitable solely for growth based on our styles scores.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions has been net zero. Notably, INCY has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

279,INCY,"Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) announced that it will acquire Impact Biomedicines for an upfront amount of $1.1 billion.Per the terms of agreement, Impact Biomedicines’ shareholders will receive contingent payments based on regulatory approval and sales-based milestones. The maximum aggregate amount payable for such milestone payments is $1.4 billion.  The aggregate tiered sales-based milestone payments could total to a maximum of $4.5 billion if global annual net sales exceed $5.0 billion.The acquisition will add a late-stage candidate, fedratinib, a highly selective JAK2 kinase inhibitor, to Celgene’s pipeline.  The candidate is being developed for the treatment of myelofibrosis (MF) and polycythemia vera. Fedratinib demonstrated statistically significant improvements in the primary and secondary endpoints of splenic response and total symptom score, respectively in a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III pivotal trial (JAKARTA-1) for treatment-naïve MF.In addition, a multi-center, single-arm phase II trial (JAKARTA-2) evaluated fedratinib in MF patients who were found to be resistant or intolerant to Incyte Corporation’s (INCY  -  Free Report) Jakafi which is another a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor. Fedratinib demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in splenic response and total symptom score in this second-line setting.However, we remind investors that JAKARTA-2 was stopped prematurely as the FDA put a clinical hold on the fedratinib program. The hold was put after potential cases of Wernicke’s encephalopathy were reported in eight out of 877 patients receiving one or more doses (less than one percent of treated patients). The FDA withdrew the clinical hold in August 2017. Based on the reported benefit risk profile of fedratinib from the JAKARTA-1 and JAKARTA-2 clinical trials, regulatory applications in MF are planned beginning the middle of 2018.Celgene was on the look-out of new deals and acquisitions given a lacklustre 2017.Celgene’s stock has declined 20.4% of its value in the last six months compared with the industry’s loss of 1.9%.Celgene suffered a series of setbacks over the last few months. The company suffered a setback last week when a late stage study on its lead cancer drug Revlimid in combination with Rituxan failed.The study evaluated Revlimid plus Rituxan (R2) followed by R2 maintenance compared with the standard of care featuring Rituxan plus chemotherapy (R-CHOP, R-bendamustine or R-VN CVP) followed by Rituxan maintenance for previously untreated follicular lymphoma.Celgene’s key growth engine is Revlimid. In 2016, the drug’s worldwide sales increased 20% to $7.0 billion and contributed almost 62.1% of the total revenues. Revlimid, an oral immunomodulatory drug, is currently approved for several indications including MM, myelodysplastic syndromes and mantle cell lymphoma.The failure of the study is disappointing. The drug’s label expansion would have boosted its sales potential.In addition, in October 2017, the company announced a phase III trial, REVOLVE, (CD-002) on pipeline candidate GED-0301 in Crohn’s disease and the extension trial, SUSTAIN (CD-004) were discontinued following a recommendation from the Data Monitoring Committee, which assessed overall benefit/risk during a recent interim futility analysis.Meanwhile, the deep, yet persistently slow growth of the psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis markets, especially during the entire third quarter, has led to a weak performance of Otezla. Consequently, the company also reduced its annual guidance. The challenging market conditions were driven by an increasingly restrictive PBM formulary control.On a positive note, in August 2017, the company obtained an FDA approval for Idhifa for treatment of relapsed and/or refractory acute myeloid leukemia with isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) mutation. The drug was developed in partnership with Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc (AGIO  -  Free Report).Big biotechs are looking for strategic acquisitions to bolster their portfolio and pipeline. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) also acquired Kite Pharma in 2017 to boost its portfolio.Zacks RankCelgene currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

280,INCY,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, Alexion’s track record is excellent as it has consistently beaten expectations in the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 11.12% over the trailing four quarters.Moreover, a Alexion’s shares have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has been up 13.7% compared with the industry’s gain of 9.1%.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that Alexion is likely to beat earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – which have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings.Zacks ESP: Alexion has an Earnings ESP of +0.44% as the Most Accurate estimate is $1.34 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.33. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Alexion’s Zacks Rank #3, when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Likely to Impact Q3 ResultsAlexion’s blockbuster drug, Soliris, continues to perform well. Alexion continues to identify and treat a consistently high number of new patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) with Soliris, across its 50-country operating platform.In order to further increase the commercial potential of the drug, Alexion is also working on expanding Soliris’ label into additional indications. Label expansion into additional indications would give Soliris access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug significantly.In August 2017, the European Commission expanded the indication for Soliris to include the treatment of refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adults who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive. In October, the FDA approved Soliris for the same. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Soliris indicates the drug sales to increase 4.9% from the year-ago quarter to $765 million.Meanwhile, Strensiq continues to perform well with revenues benefiting from a growing number of patients (both children as well as adults with pediatric onset disease) owing to hypophosphatasia (HPP) disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives. Going forward,  the company expects Strensiq to be a strong additional growth driver. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Strensiq indicates the drug sales to increase about 41% from the year-ago quarter to $86 million.Furthermore, the company announced some restructuring initiatives. In this context, Alexion plans to focus on rare diseases businesses in core areas of hematology, nephrology, neurology and metabolic disorders to enhance productivity.Notably, the company is expected to reduce spending and headcount associated with the previously announced de-prioritized pipeline programs as well as optimizing additional R&D expenses. Alexion also deprioritized ALXN1101 (cPMP replacement therapy) and ALXN6000 (samalizumab) as well as partnerships with Moderna Therapeutics, Blueprint Medicines and Arbutus Biopharma.Consequently, the company will reduce its global workforce by approximately 20% and expects that the increased financial flexibility will allow it to reinvest approximately $100 million annually into R&D.While, Alexion anticipates pre-tax savings of approximately $250 million by 2019, the total pre-tax restructuring and related expenses associated with the plan will be in the range of $340- $440 million. The company targets non-GAAP operating margin of 50% by the same year. Approximately 50% of the restructuring and related expenses will result in cash outlays while the same of approximately $240 million to $300 million are expected to be recorded in 2017.In the meantime, the company’s efforts to develop its pipeline are impressive, particularly in case of ALXN1210. Currently, it is evaluating ALXN1210 (a longer-acting anti-C5 antibody that inhibits terminal complement) in phase III studies for both PNH and aHUS.In fact, the company initiated a phase III PNH switch study of ALXN1210 administered intravenously every eight weeks compared to patients currently treated with Soliris. Therefore, we expect investors to focus on updates from ALXN1210 as the successful development and commercialization of the drug will boost growth prospects.However, Soliris’ quarter-to-quarter revenue growth will be impacted by the enrollment ramp-up of trials on ALXN1210 (by $70 million–$110 million), particularly in the second half of 2017.   Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

283,INCY,"One important criterion for successful investing is accurate identification of overblown toxic stocks and the rightly priced ones. However, it is not easy to precisely distinguish these two categories of stocks. Investors who can figure out the toxic stocks correctly and throw them away at the right time are likely to gain at the end.  Overhyped toxic stocks are usually vulnerable to outside shocks and burdened with a huge amount of debt. Also, the price of toxic stocks is unreasonably inflated. However, the high price of the toxic stocks is only temporary as  it is higher than its intrinsic value.The unjustifiably high price of toxic stocks can be ascribed to either an irrational exuberance associated with them or some serious fundamental drawbacks associated with the stock. Owning such bloated stocks for an inordinate period of time can be corrosive to investors and may result in huge loss of wealth.Investors may benefit from the correct identification of toxic stocks with the help of an investing strategy known as short selling. This strategy allows them to sell a stock first and then buy it when the price falls.While short selling excels in bear markets, it typically loses money in bull markets.So, identifying toxic stocks and abandoning them at the accurate time is the key to protect your portfolio from big losses. Profits can be made by short selling them.Screening CriteriaHere is a winning strategy that will help you to identify overpriced toxic stocks:Most recent Debt/Equity Ratio greater than the median industry average: High debt/equity ratio implies high leverage. High leverage indicates a huge level of repayment that the company has to make in connection with the debt amount.P/E using 12-month forward EPS estimate greater than 50: A very high forward P/E implies that a stock is highly overvalued.% Change in F (1) and F (2) Estimate (12 Weeks) less than -5: Negative EPS estimate revision for this and the next fiscal year during the past 12 weeks points to analysts’ pessimism.Zacks Rank more than or equal to #3 (Hold): We have not considered Buy-rated stocks that generally outperform the market.Here are five of the 20 toxic stocks that showed up on the screen:Covanta Holding Corporation (CVA  -  Free Report) is a Morristown, NJ-based alternative energy company that provides waste and energy services in the United States and Canada.

284,INCY,"Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) announced that the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) published an abstract containing new and updated data from the ongoing phase I/II ECHO-202 trial on epacadostat.The ECHO-202 study (NCT02178722) is evaluating the safety and efficacy of Incyte’s selective IDO1 enzyme inhibitor epacadostat in combination with Merck & Co.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda in patients with advanced melanoma.Data from the study revealed robust and durable responses in patients with advanced melanoma treated with the combination of epacadostat and Keytruda.Across all efficacy-evaluable advanced melanoma patients, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 12.4 months, with PFS rates of 70%, 54%, and 50% at 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months respectively. Median PFS was not reached for patients who were treatment-naïve for advanced disease, with landmark PFS rates of 68%, 52% and 52% at 6 months, 12 months and 18 months, respectively.The ECHO clinical trial program is being conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of epacadostat as a core component of combination therapy in oncology. Incyte is evaluating epacadostat in combination with PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors in a broad range of solid tumor types as well as hematological malignancies.ECHO-301 (NCT02752074), a phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is investigating Keytruda in combination with epacadostat or placebo for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma, is also ongoing and fully recruited.Meawnhile, Incyte has extended its collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) evaluating epacadostat in combination with Opdivo in pivotal studies in two tumor types (planned initiation before 2017 end).In 2014, Incyte signed clinical trial collaboration agreements with Merck, Bristol-Myers, and Roche Holding AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) among others to evaluate epacadostat with their respective anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 agents in phase I/II studies.Incyte’s stock gained 38.7% in the year so far compared with the industry’s 15.3% gain.We believe the agreements not only validate the company’s research approach, they also enhance the company‘s financial position as Incyte stands to earn revenues in the form of milestone payments and royalties on successful development and commercialization.However, in June 2017, Incyte and Roche decided to end the ECHO-110 trial of epacadostat plus Tecentriq for further enrolment because of slow study recruitment.Zacks RankIncyte currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

285,INCY,"AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced that its investigational oral JAK-1 selective inhibitor, upadacitinib, met the primary endpoints in a phase III study from its SELECT program, which evaluated the candidate for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”).AbbVie’s shares have outperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has surged 55.5% compared with the industry’s 16.1% rally.The phase III study — SELECT-MONOTHERAPY — evaluated upadacitinib monotherapy in moderate to severe RA patients who were not responsive to methotrexate for a period of 14-weeks. Both the once daily doses, 15 mg and 30 mg, evaluated in the study demonstrated superiority in ACR20 response and low disease activity (LDA) compared to methotrexate.The ACR20 response was achieved in 68% of the patients receiving 15 mg dose while the response rate was 71% for the 30 mg dose versus 41% for methotrexate. The LDA was achieved in 41%, 28% and 8% of patients receiving 30 mg, 15 mg or methotrexate, respectively.Upadacitinib is being evaluated in a large program, which includes six studies on RA patients. AbbVie is also developing the candidate in psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis and atopic dermatitis.The candidate has also met endpoints in two phase III studies from the SELECT program. The SELECT-MONOTHERAPY study supported the potential of the candidate in treating RA patients without a background methotrexate therapy.Successful development of upadacitinib will boost AbbVie’s RA portfolio, which already includes the blockbuster drug, Humira. Sales of Humira ($13.5 billion) accounted for 66% of net revenues in the first nine months of 2017.The approval of Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) / Eli Lilly and Company’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Olumiant in Europe in February 2017 has not had any significant impact on Humira’s sales, as it is approved in patients who are unresponsive to TNF inhibitors like Humira. Moreover, Olumiant’s new drug application received a complete response letter from the FDA in April this year. Meanwhile, upadacitinib may be in direct line of competition with Olumiant as both are JAK-inhibitors.AbbVie Inc. Price AbbVie Inc. Price | AbbVie Inc.

(CLDX  -  Free Report) is a better-ranked stock in the pharma sector, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

286,INCY,"One of the keys to successful investing is precise identification of overhyped toxic stocks and the correctly priced ones. But it is not easy to accurately distinguish between these two types of stocks. Investors who can correctly spot the toxic stocks and get rid of them at the right time are likely to benefit at the end.  Usually, overblown toxic stocks are susceptible to external shocks and are loaded with hefty amount of debts. Also, the price of the toxic stocks is unjustifiably high. The high price of toxic stocks is only short-lived as the current bloated price of the toxic stocks is higher than its intrinsic value.The exorbitant price of toxic stocks can be due to either an irrational exuberance associated with them or some fundamental drawbacks associated with the stock. Owning such stocks for a long stretch of time can be detrimental to investors and may result in huge erosion of wealth.Investors may gain from the accurate identification of toxic stocks with the help of an investing strategy known as short selling. This strategy allows them to sell a stock first and then buy it when the price falls.While short selling excels in bear markets, it typically loses money in bull markets.So, picking up toxic stocks and  discarding them at the right time is the key to protect your portfolio from big losses. Profits can be made by short selling them.Screening CriteriaHere is a winning strategy that will help you to identify overpriced toxic stocks:Most recent Debt/Equity Ratio greater than the median industry average: High debt/equity ratio implies high leverage. High leverage indicates a huge level of repayment that the company has to make in connection with the debt amount.P/E using 12-month forward EPS estimate greater than 50: A very high forward P/E implies that a stock is highly overvalued.% Change in F (1) and F (2) Estimate (12 Weeks) less than -5: Negative EPS estimate revision for this and the next fiscal year during the past 12 weeks points to analysts’ pessimism.Zacks Rank more than or equal to #3 (Hold): We have not considered Buy-rated stocks that generally outperform the market.Here are five of the 25 toxic stocks that showed up on the screen:Wilmington, DE-based Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) is a drug discovery company. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter loss rose from 47 cents per share to 51 cents. Incyte carries a Zacks Rank #3.

287,INCY,"Per the latest Earnings Preview, the Q1 earnings season which has already crossed the half way mark is gaining strength with earnings and revenue growth on track to reach its highest level in seven years.Total earnings for the 267 S&P 500 members that have already reported results are up 25.1% from the same period last year on 10% higher revenues, with 76.8% beating top-line estimates and 73.8% beating revenue estimates.

(AMGN  -  Free Report) also surpassed both earnings and revenue expectations this quarter.Higher demand is expected to boost new product sales. Also, innovation and successful product line expansion along with positive clinical study results, FDA approvals, and consistent performance of key products, growing demand for drugs, especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an ageing population as well as an increased healthcare expenditure are some of the factors that are expected keep the sector on a growth trajectory.Also, according to the Earnings Preview, the broader Medical sector (inclusive of drug, biotech as well as Medical Device companies) is likely to record 7% year-over-year growth in revenues and witness a 12.9% rise in earnings in the quarter under review.Four pharma/biotech giants are scheduled to report Q1 earnings results on May 1.

The company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10.71% in the last reported quarter. The company’s performance has been impressive in the recent past with its earnings surpassing expectations in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 4.97%.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.  The combination of the company’s Zacks Rank #2 and +1.36 Earnings ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s earnings for the quarter under review is pegged at 74 cents per share.In the Innovative Health segment, new products like Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis) and Ibrance (breast cancer) as well as older products like Lyrica (neuropathic pain), Chantix (smoking cessation) and Eliquis (blood thinner) are expected to drive the top line. In the Essential Health, biosimilars and emerging markets are expected to support sales. The bottom line is expected to be driven by cost savings and share buybacks.(Read More:Will Pfizer's Earnings Beat Estimates Again in Q1?)Pfizer Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Pfizer Inc.

The company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.26% in the last reported quarter. The company’s track record is excellent as it has consistently topped estimates in the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 8.54%.Our model does not conclusively show that Merck will beat estimates this quarter.

The consensus mark for the quarter to be reported is pegged at $1.66 per share.The company’s Strong HIV performance and other antiviral product sales are being driven by continued uptake of tenofovir alafenamide (“TAF”) based products — Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey. We expect the trend to continue in the first quarter as well. The franchise received a further boost with the FDA approval of once-daily single tablet regimen (“STR”), Biktarvy (bictegravir 50mg/emtricitabine 200mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25mg, BIC/FTC/TAF) for HIV-1 infection in February 2018.

The sales guidance for 2018 was also impressive. In October 2017, the FDA approved a label update of the drug to include the addition of new patient-reported outcome data from the COMFORT-I study, as well as updating the warning related to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. The pivotal REACH1 trial evaluating Jakafi in patients with steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease has completed enrollment and results are expected in the first half of 2018.Assuming successful results, Incyte expects to submit an sNDA seeking approval of Jakafi for this indication.

288,INCY,"Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $1.05, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.03 per share by 1.9%. Earnings rose 19% from the year-ago quarter backed by volume driven pharma sales growth and higher operating profits.Revenues BeatQuarterly revenues of $5.66 billion also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.52 billion by 2.5%. Sales grew 9% year over year backed by strong performance of the new drugs as well as Lilly’s diabetes products. Lilly’s diabetes products recorded revenue growth of 39% worldwide.Volumes rose 7% as a strong performance of new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Jardiance and Lartruvo offset decline in sales of established products like Zyprexa, Alimta, Cialis, Strattera and Effient. Higher realized prices for several drugs also contributed 2% to sales growth in the quarter.Revenue in DetailPharmaceutical revenues rose 10% in the quarter backed by 14% volume growth of the new products.While U.S. revenues grew 9% to $3.1 billion, ex-U.S. revenues rose 8% to $2.55 billion.Established products that recorded growth during the quarter include Forteo (up 13% to $441.7 million) and Humalog (up 9% to $696.2 million). Sales of all other established products declined in the quarter.Alimta sales declined 10% to $514.5 million, reflecting lower demand in the United States due to competitive pressure, mainly from immuno-oncology agents. Outside the United States., sales of Alimta were hurt by loss of exclusivity in several countries, increased competition and lower realized prices.Zyprexa sales declined 6% to $140.6 million due to loss of exclusivity.Humulin sales decreased 7% in the quarter to $300.5 million due to lower realized prices and unfavorable buying patterns in China.Cialis sales declined 4% to $564.9 million hurt by lower demand in the United States as well as increased competition from generic sildenafilErbitux sales declined 11% to $163.5 million in the quarter. Strattera sales declined 31% to $137.1 million. Cymbalta sales declined 42% to $183.2 million. Effient sales declined 56% to $55.9 million in the quarter.Among the new products, Trulicity generated revenues of $527.7 million, up 117% year over year, with U.S. revenues benefiting from growth in the GLP-1 market and market share gains.Cyramza revenues were $196.0 million, up 23% year over year, backed by continued strong outside U.S. revenues and improved U.S. revenues. Cyramza’s ex-U.S. revenues benefited from strong volumes in Japan. U.S. revenues increased 4% driven by increased volume.Jardiance sales (up 168% to $127.2 million) were driven by increased market share within the growing SGLT2 class.Basaglar recorded revenues of $145.7 million compared with $86.6 million in the previous quarter backed by strong launch uptake. Basaglar - Lilly and partner Boehringer Ingelheim’s follow-on insulin to Sanofi’s (SNY  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug, Lantus - was launched in the United States in mid-December 2016 where it generated revenues of $115.2 million in the quarter.Taltz brought in sales of $151.3 million compared with $138.7 million in the previous quarter, reflecting strong launch uptake.Lartruvo (olaratumab) generated revenues of $54.5 million in the third quarter of 2017 compared with $47.4 million in the previous quarter. Lartruvo was launched in the United States and the EU for soft tissue sarcoma in the fourth quarter of 2016.Lilly and partner Incyte Corporation’s (INCY  -  Free Report) rheumatoid arthritis (RA) drug Olumiant (baricitinib) has been launched in select European countries and in Japan. The drug generated sales of $16.2 million in the third quarter of 2017 compared with $4.8 million in the previous quarter backed by strong launch uptake in Germany.However, in the United States, Lilly received a complete response letter (CRL) from the FDA for baricitinib in April for want of additional data. In August, Lilly and Incyte announced that they will re-submit the NDA for baricitinib much faster than previously expected. The NDA is expected to be re-submitted before the end of January next year.Lilly's Elanco Animal Health segment sales rose 5% to $740.6 million due to inclusion of revenues from the acquisition of Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica's U.S. feline, canine and rabies (acquired in January 2017). However, worldwide competitive pressure continued to hurt sales in the segment.Concurrent with the earnings release, Lilly said that it is exploring strategic alternatives for the Elanco Animal Health business including a sale, merger or creating a separate company through an initial public offer. A decision regarding the same is expected to be made no later than the middle of next year and Lilly may ultimately opt to retain the business.Gross Margin Down but Operating Income RisesAdjusted gross margin of 75.1% in the quarter decreased 130 basis points as manufacturing efficiencies were offset by negative product mix and the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold.Operating income increased 18% to $1.38 billion. Total operating expenses, as a percent of revenues, declined 310 basis points in the quarter to 50.8%.2017 Outlook UppedLilly raised its previously issued 2017 adjusted earnings and sales outlook for the second time this year. Adjusted earnings per share are now expected in the range of $4.15 to $4.25 compared with $4.10 to $4.20 expected previously. Revenues are expected in the range of $22.4 billion and $22.7 billion, up from $22.0–$22.5 billion expected previously.Gross margin is expected to be approximately 76%, same as previously expected. Adjusted tax rate is still expected to be approximately 21% (previously approximately 22%).Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are still expected in the range of $6.4–$6.6 billion, while research and development expenses are projected to be $5.1-$5.2 billion compared with $5.0-$5.2 billion expected previously.Our TakeLilly’s third-quarter 2017 results were strong with the company beating estimates on both counts. The pharma giant also raised its sales and earnings outlook for the year. The increase in revenue guidance was supported by strong uptake trends of the new products and also, to some extent, due to the positive impact of Euro.Shares were up 2.6% in pre-market trading. So far this year, Lilly’s share price has risen 18.5% compared with an increase of 20.2% for the industry.Going forward, new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Cyramza, Jardiance and Lartruvo are expected to see higher revenues. Lilly also expects some established products like Trajenta, Forteo and Humalog to continue doing well. Lilly is also progressing well with its pipeline. Earlier this month, Lilly gained FDA approval for Verzenio (abemaciclib), a CDK 4/6 inhibitor for metastatic breast cancer. Since 2014, Lilly has launched nine medicines, including Verzenio and plans to launch eleven more by 2023.However, Alimta will continue to be impacted by competition. Other headwinds include competition from immuno-oncology agents as well as loss of exclusivity for many drugs in emerging markets.Lilly carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.  Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report), which also reported third-quarter results today, beat estimates for both earnings and sales.

289,INCY,"Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) will report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.73%.Lilly’s shares have risen 17% this year so far while the industry recorded an increase of 18.2%.Lilly’s performance has been mixed with earnings missing expectations in two of the last four quarters while beating the same in the other two, bringing the average negative surprise to 0.89%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors to ConsiderNew products like Trulicity, Taltz and Jardiance have supported the top line in the past few quarters. We expect the trend to continue in the third quarter of 2017 as well. While Trulicity sales are expected to be driven by growth in the GLP-1 market and market share gains, Jardiance sales are likely to be driven by increased market share within the growing SGLT2 class. Newer products like Basaglar, Lartruvo and Taltz may continue to witness better sequential sales backed by strong launch uptake.However, sales of Alimta, Cymbalta and Zyprexa are expected to decline due to the loss of exclusivity. Cymbalta has lost exclusivity in Europe and Canada, Zyprexa in Japan and Alimta in several countries outside the United States. Meanwhile, lower demand in the United States due to competitive pressure mainly from immuno-oncology agents is hurting Alimta sales in the country. The consensus estimate for Alimta for the third quarter is $508 million.Another new drug Olumiant (baricitinib) has been launched in select European countries. In July, the drug was approved in Japan, which is likely to add to the top line in the third quarter. However, in the United States, the drug is under review. In August, Lilly and partner Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) announced that they will re-submit the NDA for baricitinib much faster than previously expected. The NDA is expected to be re-submitted in January next year.Meanwhile, older products like Humulin, Trajenta and Forteo may continue to do well.Animal Health segment sales, in the past two quarters, have been hurt by global competitive pressure. At the Q2 conference call, management had said that the global competitive pressure will continue to hurt revenues in the segment through the rest of the year, though to a lesser extent. The consensus estimate for Animal Health segment for the third quarter is $715 million.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Lilly is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is -0.14%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Lilly’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Eli Lilly and Company Price and EPS Surprise Eli Lilly and Company Price and EPS Surprise | Eli Lilly and Company QuoteStocks to ConsiderStocks in the pharmaceuticals sector that have both a positive ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank includeBristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report), scheduled to release results on Oct 26, with an Earnings ESP of +2.35% and a Zacks Rank #3.

290,INCY,"Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) announced a new 208-week (4-year) follow-up data from the phase III RESPONSE study of Jakafi. The study compared the efficacy and safety of Jakafi with best available therapy (BAT) in patients with polycythemia vera (PV), who are resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea (HU).The primary response was a composite endpoint of the proportion of patients, who achieved both hematocrit (Hct) control (defined as no phlebotomy eligibility from week 8 through week 32) and a spleen volume reduction of at least 35% from baseline at week 32. The study met the primary endpoint showing that Jakafi was superior to BAT at controlling hematocrit (Hct) and reducing spleen volume at week 32.The data from this study showed that durable primary response to Jakafi in patients with PV who are resistant to or intolerant of HU and overall safety profile for Jafaki remained consistent with the 80-week RESPONSE data published earlier. In fact, the 80 week follow up from the RESPONSE study confirmed that among patients who initially responded to Jakafi treatment have probability of maintaining primary and hematocrit (Hct) responses for greater than 80 weeks was 92% and 89%, respectively. Thus confirming that Jakafi could be an effective long-term treatment option for patients with PV who are HU-resistant or intolerant.So far this year, Incyte’s shares have declined 3.7%, as against the industry’s growth of 2.6%.Jakafi is Incyte’s sole marketed product and is a first-in-class JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor. It is approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with polycythemia vera (PV), who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to hydroxyurea. Also, Jakafi is approved for the treatment of patients with intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis (MF) including primary MF, post-PV MF, and post-essential thrombocythemia MF.While Incyte markets the drug in the United States, it is marketed by Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) as Jakavi outside the country. Its label has been updated several times since approval. In March 2016, the FDA approved supplemental labeling for Jakafi to include additional safety data as well as efficacy analyses from the RESPONSE study that assessed the durability of response in Jakafi-treated patients after 80 weeks.Incyte Corporation Price Incyte Corporation Price | Incyte Corporation QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderIncyte has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

291,INCY,"Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 1, before the market opens.In the last reported quarter, the company beat estimates by 103.85%.Incyte’s earnings track record has been decent so far. Over last four quarters, the company’s earnings surpassed expectations thrice, while missing in one. Incyte delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 67.05% in the said time frame.  Incyte’s stock has lost 46.2% in the last six months, worse than the industry’s decline of 8.5%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Incyte is likely to beat on earnings this quarter because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP:  Incyte has an Earnings ESP of +92.00%, as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at earnings of 16 cents per share while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at an earnings of 8 cents. A positive ESP hints at an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank:  Incyte has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. Further, combined with a positive ESP, chances of an earnings beat are usually pegged higher.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors Driving the GrowthIncyte’s lead drug, Jakafi (ruxolitinib), is a first-in-class JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, approved for the treatment of patients with polycythemia vera (“PV”), patients with intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis (“MF”), including primary MF, post-PV MF, and post-essential thrombocythemia MF. While Incyte markets the drug in the United States, it is marketed by Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) as Jakavi outside the country.Incyte continues to gain traction by Jakafi’s performance.  Incyte's Jakafi performance was strong in 2017 driven by patient demand. The sales guidance for 2018 was also impressive. In October 2017, the FDA approved a label update of the drug to include the addition of new patient-reported outcome data from the COMFORT-I study, as well as updating the warning related to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. The pivotal REACH1 trial evaluating Jakafi in patients with steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease (“GVHD”) has completed enrollment and results are expected in the first half of 2018.Assuming successful results, Incyte expects to submit an sNDA seeking approval of Jakafi for this indication. Jakafi sales are expected to get a boost from the updated labels. Incyte expects Jakafi revenues in the range of $1.35-$1.4 billion in 2018, more than 20% growth over 2017.We remind investors that while Jakafi sales and royalties are a key component of Incyte’s revenue growth, Iclusig sales and Olumiant royalties are also contributing to the top line.Iclusig revenues are expected in the range of $80-$85 million.R&D expenses are expected in the range of $1,077-1,172 million. SG&A expenses are expected in the range of $465-$480 million.We also expect investors to focus on pipeline updates since Incyte suffered a few setbacks this month. Incyte and partner Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) announced the failure of a combination therapy — Incyte’s epacadostat and Merck’s Keytruda — in achieving improved progression free survival over Keytruda alone in phase III study ECHO-301/KEYNOTE-252. The study was evaluating the combination drugs for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma. An external data monitoring committee recommended the termination of the study following the review of the data from the pivotal study.Moreover, the FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee has recommended an approval of the 2-mg dose of baricitinib, a once-daily oral medication for the treatment of moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis for adult patients who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate. However, the advisory committee did not recommend approval of the 4-mg dose of baricitinib for the proposed indication based on the adequacy of the safety and benefit-risk profiles. While the FDA is generally not required to follow the Advisory Committee's recommendation, but it will consider the same during its review of the NDA for baricitinib. The FDA had earlier issued a Complete Response Letter for the same.A Stock to ConsiderHere is one other health care stock worth considering with the right combination of elements to beat on earnings:GW Pharmaceuticals plc (GWPH  -  Free Report) is expected to report earnings on May 8. The company has an Earnings ESP of +8.11% and a Zacks Rank #2.   You can see see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

292,INCY,"Investors who can precisely differentiate between overpriced stocks and fairly priced stocks emerge winners. However, in this complicated market place, these two types of stocks are intertwined in such a way that it is very tough to identify them. Investors who can pick the toxic stocks appropriately and abandon them at the right time are likely to benefit.Generally, the overblown toxic stocks are susceptible to outside shocks and are loaded with high levels of debts. Also, the price of the toxic stocks is unrealistically high. The irrationally inflated price of the toxic stocks is only short-lived in nature as their intrinsic value falls short of the current hyped price.The overhyped price of toxic stocks can be attributed to either an irrational exuberance associated with them or some fundamental drawbacks associated with the stock. Owning such stocks for a long period of time is detrimental and may lead to huge erosion of wealth.On the other side, investors may gain from the accurate identification of toxic stocks with the help of an investing strategy called short selling. This strategy allows you to sell a stock first and then buy it when the price falls.While short selling excels in bear markets, it typically loses money in bull markets.So, figuring out toxic stocks and discarding them at the right time is the key to protect your portfolio from big losses. Profits can be made by short selling them.Screening CriteriaHere is a winning strategy that will help you to identify overpriced toxic stocks:Most recent Debt/Equity Ratio greater than the median industry average: High debt/equity ratio implies high leverage. High leverage indicates a huge level of repayment that the company has to make in connection with the debt amount.P/E using 12-month forward EPS estimate greater than 50: A very high forward P/E implies that a stock is highly overvalued.% Change in F (1) and F (2) Estimate (12 Weeks) less than -5: Negative EPS estimate revision for this and the next fiscal year during the past 12 weeks points to analysts’ pessimism.Zacks Rank more than or equal to #3 (Hold): We have not considered Buy-rated stocks that generally outperform the market.Here are five of the 20 toxic stocks that showed up on the screen:PTC Inc. (PTC  -  Free Report) is a Needham, MA-based software company engaged in developing, marketing and supporting software solutions. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter earnings remained unchanged at 37 cents. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #3.

293,INCY,"We issued an updated research report on Agenus Inc. (AGEN  -  Free Report) on Sep 26, 2017.Notably, Agenus is an immuno-oncology company focused on the discovery and development of checkpoint modulators, vaccines and adjuvants for the treatment of cancer.In fact, the company has collaboration agreements with a number of companies, which not only provide it with funds in the form of upfront and milestone payments and future royalties but also validate the company’s proprietary product platform. Agenus has formed collaborations with Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) and Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) to discover and develop multiple checkpoint antibodies.In February 2017, Agneus and Incyte amended the agreement. The amended agreement converts the ongoing GITR and OX40 antibody programs from co-funded development and profit-sharing arrangements to royalty-bearing programs.Per the agreement, Incyte will be responsible for funding and conducting global development and commercialization. When any of the two candidates from either of these two programs are approved, Agenus would be entitled to receive 15% royalties on global net sales of each approved product.Following the amended agreement, Agenus received accelerated milestone payments of $20 million from Incyte related to the clinical development of INCAGN1876 (anti-GITR agonist) and INCAGN1949 (anti-OX40 agonist). Across all programs in the collaboration, Agenus will be eligible to receive up to a total of $510 million for future potential development, regulatory and commercial milestones.The company’s collaboration agreements with players like Incyte and Merck not only validate its technology platforms but also provide the company with funds.In fact, we note that the company’s QS-21 Stimulon adjuvant is partnered with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) and is a key component in multiple GSK vaccine programs that target prophylactic or therapeutic impact in a variety of infectious diseases and cancer.Moreover, Agenus’ efforts in developing Prophage vaccine for glioblastoma multiforme are encouraging. It is also exploring different options to advance the Prophage vaccine into a phase III study in newly-diagnosed GBM either alone or in collaboration with a third party. Also, the company is looking for partners to fund studies with plans of retaining commercialization rights in the United States.The company announced its strategic decision to spin off its cell therapy businesses as a separate unit. Also, it has made this decision so that it can make smaller teams that can entirely focus on getting the products approved. We expect the combined value of the separate companies will far exceed the perceived value under one roof, going forward.  However, Agenus has no approved product in its portfolio. With only a few candidates in mid-stages of development, including Prophage Series vaccine and a number of QS-21 Stimulon-containing vaccine candidates, the company is still a few years away from bringing a product to market. Any hiccup in the development process of these candidates may weigh heavily on the stock. Agenus is highly dependent on its partners for the development of its candidates.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

294,INCY,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has denied approval to its investigational rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, sirukumab, an IL-6 inhibitor, for want of additional safety data.The FDA issued a complete response letter (CRL) for J&J’s Biologics License Application (BLA) for sirukumab which was filed in September last year.The company is looking to get sirukumab approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response or are intolerant to one or more disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).Regulatory applications are under review in EU and Japan as well. The proposed trade name for sirukumab is Plivensia.So far this year, J&J’s share price has increased 13.8%, comparing unfavorably with a gain of 17% recorded by the industry it belongs to.The CRL was somewhat expected as last month, FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee had not recommended approval of sirukumab, raising some safety concerns. The panel was concerned with the increased mortality rates for both the evaluated doses of (50 mg and 100 mg) of sirukumab.The FDA in its CRL has asked for additional clinical data to further evaluate the safety of the candidate. J&J plans to meet with the FDA for a follow-up discussion. The CRL is expected to delay the drug’s approval, which was previously expected to happen this year.In July this year, J&J’s partner for sirukumab, U.K. based drug giant GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report), informed the termination of its collaboration with J&J.We remind investors that Eli Lilly & Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and partner Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) had also received a CRL for their experimental JAK inhibitor, baricitinib to treat RA as the FDA demanded additional data.However, in August, the companies informed that they will re-submit the NDA for baricitinib much faster than previously expected as they will not be required to conduct an additional study. The NDA is expected to be re-submitted in January next year.RA is a common, chronic, life-long, autoimmune disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States.J&J carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

295,INCY,"Eli Lilly & Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and partner Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) announced that they will re-submit the new drug application (NDA) for its rheumatoid arthritis (RA) drug, baricitinib much faster than previously expected. The NDA is expected to be re-submitted in January next year.In July, Lilly had said that the NDA resubmission for baricitinib will not occur this year and will be delayed by a minimum of 18 months. At that time, Lilly had said that it will evaluate options for resubmission, including further discussions with the FDA or conducting an additional clinical study.In the latest press release, Lilly/Incyte said that the matter was discussed with the FDA this month. Lilly expects the revised submission, which will include new safety and efficacy data, to be classified by the FDA as a Class II resubmission. A decision from the FDA is therefore expected in six months. Importantly, a new clinical study will not be required.Shares of Incyte were up more than 10% on Wednesday while that of Lilly were up around 2.5%. So far this year, Lilly’s share price has risen 6.8% compared with an increase of 11.3% for the industry.The FDA had issued a complete response letter (CRL) for baricitinib earlier this year in April. At that time, the agency had told the companies that it is unable to approve baricitinib NDA in its current form. The FDA had asked for additional clinical data to determine the most appropriate doses as well as to further characterize safety concerns across treatment arms.Baricitinib, a once-daily oral medication, is already marketed in the EU by the trade name of Olumiant. The drug generated sales of $4.8 million in the second quarter of 2017 and $1.9 million in the first quarter.Baricitinib is also being studied in phase II studies for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and systemic lupus erythematosus while the phase III program for psoriatic arthritis is expected to begin next year.The RA market is highly crowded given the presence of treatments like Humira and Xeljanz among others.

296,INCY,"CAR-T stocks were in the news this week with key biotech player, Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) announcing its intention to acquire Kite Pharma , one of the most advanced players in the CAR-T therapy market. Moreover, the FDA approved Novartis’ Kymriah yesterday, making it the first CAR-T therapy to gain approval in the U.S.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesGilead Looks to Boost Oncology Pipeline with Kite Deal: Gilead has finally announced an M&A deal with the company saying that it will acquire Kite Pharma for $180 per share in cash or approximately $11.9 billion. Gilead has been under a lot of pressure to utilize its huge pile of cash for a major acquisition deal given the dwindling sales of its erstwhile top-selling hepatitis C virus (""HCV"") franchise. The Kite acquisition, slated to close in the fourth quarter, will place Gilead among the top players in the emerging field of cell therapy. Kite’s expertise lies in developing engineered cell therapies that express either a chimeric antigen receptor (""CAR"") or an engineered T cell receptor (""TCR""), depending on the type of cancer.Kite already has a CAR-T therapy, axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel), under priority FDA review with a response expected by Nov 29, 2017. EU approval could come next year. Axi-cel is under review for the treatment of refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (""NHL""), which includes diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (""DLBCL""), transformed follicular lymphoma (""TFL"") and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (""PMBCL""). Other candidates in Kite’s pipeline include those targeting hematologic cancers as well as solid tumors (Also read: Gilead to Fly High with Kite Pharma Acquisition for $11.9B). Axi-cel has blockbuster potential though Novartis is currently the first company to gain approval in the U.S. for a CAR-T treatment with the FDA approving the company’s Kymriah.Kite’s shares were up 28% following the acquisition news while year to date, the stock has gained 296.9%, substantially outperforming the 9.7% rally of the industry it belongs to.With the Kite-Gilead deal being announced, other companies involved in CAR-T treatment saw their shares shooting up on hopes that more M&A deals will be announced in this segment of the market.

The drug addresses pathogens designated by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (""CDC"") as urgent and serious antimicrobial resistance threats, and pathogens cited by the World Health Organization (""WHO"") as a critical need for new antibiotics. Vabomere will enjoy an additional 5 years of exclusivity given its status as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (""QIDP"") under the Generating Antibiotics Incentives Now (""GAIN"") Act. The Medicines Company intends to launch Vabomere in the fourth quarter.Priority Review for BioMarin Drug: BioMarin Pharmaceutical’s (BMRN  -  Free Report) pegvaliase got priority review in the U.S. for the reduction of blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels in adult patients with phenylketonuria (""PKU"") who have uncontrolled blood Phe levels on existing management.

297,INCY,"The biotech sector witnessed a series of events over the past week. Quite a few companies reported quarterly results over the week alongside announcing pipeline updates. Over the past week while Amgen revised its annual guidance, Biogen reported quarterly numbers wherein sales missed estimates.Recap of Important Stories:Prothena Plunges on Discontinuation of Study: Shares of Prothena Corp. (PRTA  -  Free Report) plunged as the company decided to discontinue the development of its lead pipeline candidate, NEOD001. The candidate, an antibody, was being evaluated for the treatment of AL amyloidosis. A phase IIb study, PRONTO, did not meet its primary or secondary endpoints. Hence, the company asked the independent data monitoring committee (“DMC”) of the phase III VITAL study to review a futility analysis of the ongoing VITAL study. Thereafter, the DMC recommended discontinuation of the VITAL study for futility.Hence, the company decided to discontinue all studies for the development of NEOD001, including the VITAL study as well as the open label extension studies. The decision came as a major blow to the investors as the company has a very limited number of candidates in its pipeline and NEOD001 was a lead candidate.Prothena carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Incyte/Lilly’s Drug Gets FDA Advisory Committee Nod: Incyte Corp.

298,INCY,"Eli Lilly & Company (LLY  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share of $1.34, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.13 per share by 18.6%. Earnings rose 37% from the year-ago quarter backed by robust volume-driven growth in new product sales and lower operating costs and tax rates.Including asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges, first-quarter earnings per share were $1.16 against a loss of 10 cents in the first-quarter of 2017.Revenues in DetailQuarterly revenues of $5.70 billion also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.53 billion. Sales grew 9% year over year backed by strong performance of new drugs and favorable currency movement, which made up for lower sales of established products like Strattera, Cialis and Forteo.Volumes rose 2% as increased demand for new products like Trulicity, Cyramza, Taltz, Basaglar, Jardiance and Lartruvo offset decline in sales of some established products. However, volume growth was softer than 4% in the previous quarter.Higher realized prices for several drugs contributed 3% to sales growth in the quarter. Foreign exchange rate also had a favorable impact of 4%.While U.S. revenues grew 8% to $3.16 billion, ex-U.S. revenues rose 11% to $2.55 billion.Pharmaceutical revenues rose 11% in the quarter. However, decreased demand for food animal products continued to hurt sales in Lilly’s Animal Health segment.Established products that recorded growth during the quarter include Humalog (up 12% year over year to $791.7 million), Humulin (up 4% to $325.9 million) and Trajenta (up 25% to $141.1 million). Sales of all other established products declined in the quarter.Forteo sales declined 10% to $313.2 million due to decreased volume from unfavorable wholesale and retail buying patterns in the United States.Cymbalta sales declined 3% to $169.6 million while Erbitux sales declined 3% to $149.6 million.Alimta sales rose 2% to $499.6 million as higher sales in United States offset sales decline in international markets. In ex-U.S. markets, sales declined 3% to $254.3 million due to competitive pressure and loss of exclusivity in certain countries. However, sales of Alimta increased 8% to $245.3 million in the United States due to increased volume and higher realized prices.Zyprexa sales declined 17% to $122.6 million due to loss of exclusivity in Japan.Cialis sales declined 7% to $495.4 million hurt by lower demand in United States and loss of exclusivity in Europe.Strattera sales declined 33% to $130.7 million due to loss of exclusivity.Among the new products, Trulicity generated revenues of $678.3 million, up 82% year over year, with U.S. revenues benefiting from growth in the GLP-1 market and market share gains.Cyramza revenues were $183.6 million, up 7% year over year, backed by strong demand. Cyramza’s ex-U.S. revenues increased 10%, benefiting from strong volumes and currency benefit, partially offset by lower realized prices. U.S. revenues increased 3% driven by increased volume and higher realized prices.Jardiance sales surged 104% to $151 million, driven by increased market share within the growing SGLT2 class in the United States and increased volume outside the United States.Basaglar recorded revenues of $166.0 million compared with $153.8 million in the previous quarter. It generated revenues of $126.7 million in the United States, which improved sequentially driven by increased demand as the drug gained Medicare Part D formulary access.Taltz brought in sales of $146.5 million compared with $172.5 million in the previous quarter as higher ex-U.S. revenues were offset by lower U.S. sales, which were hurt by unfavorable specialty pharmacy buying patterns.Lartruvo (olaratumab) generated revenues of $64.4 million in the quarter compared with $59.0 million in the previous quarter.Olumiant (baricitinib) has been launched in select European countries and in Japan for moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis. The drug generated sales of $32.2 million in the quarter backed by strong launch uptake in Germany, compared with $23.0 million in the previous quarter.The drug is under review in the United States. Lilly and partner Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) re-submitted the NDA for baricitinib in January. In a setback to the company, on Monday, Lilly informed that the FDA Advisory Committee has recommended approval of the 2-mg dose of the JAK inhibitor while not recommending the higher dose of 4-mg on the ground that its safety profile is not adequate to support an approval relative to its benefits. The final decision from the FDA is expected in June this year. Please note that in April last year, the FDA had issued a complete response letter (CRL) for the new drug application (NDA) for baricitinib on safety concerns.Verzenio, which was launched in the Unites States in the fourth quarter of 2017, generated sales of $29.7 million in the quarter compared with $21 million in the previous quarter.Elanco Animal Health segment sales declined 1% to $761.3 million due to decreased demand for food animal products.Lilly is exploring strategic alternatives for this business including a sale, merger or creating a separate company through an initial public offer. A decision regarding the same is expected to be announced in July. Lilly might ultimately opt to retain the business.Gross Margin & Operating Income Adjusted gross margin of 75.1% in the quarter decreased 270 basis points as manufacturing efficiencies and higher realized prices were offset by negative product mix and the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold.Operating income increased 29% year over year to $1.60 billion due to lower operating costs. Total operating expenses (including research and development and marketing, selling and administrative expenses), as a percent of revenues, declined 710 basis points in the quarter to 46.9% due to the company’s cost saving efforts.2018 EPS Guidance UppedLilly raised its previously issued outlook for adjusted earnings as well as sales.Adjusted earnings per share are now expected in the range of $5.10 to $5.20, higher than $4.81 to $4.91 expected previously, to reflect the expected benefit from higher operating profits and lower tax rates.The revenue range was also slightly upped to $23.7 billion to $24.2 billion from $23.0 billion to $23.5 billion expected previously.Gross margin is expected to be approximately 75%, same as previously expected. Adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 17% (previously approximately 18%).Marketing, selling and administrative expense guidance was tightened to a range of $6.2–$6.3 billion compared with $6.1–$6.4 billion previously. Research and development expense guidance was slightly increased to a range of $5.2–$5.4 billion compared with $5.0–$5.2 billion previously due to increased funding requirement for pipeline development.Our TakeLilly’s first-quarter results were impressive as it beat estimates for both earnings and sales and also raised its 2018 guidance for both metrics. Shares of the drug giant rose more than 2% in pre-market trading.However, year-to-date, Lilly’s shares have declined 5% compared with the industry’s decline of 4.7%.Going forward, Lilly’s new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Cyramza, Jardiance, Lartruvo, Verzenio and Olumiant are expected to continue to drive revenues.However, competitive pressure on Lilly’s drugs is expected to rise this year. Challenges remain for the company in the form of loss of patent exclusivity for products like Cialis this year and the impact of generic competition for Strattera, Effient and Axiron. The latest baricitinib setback was a disappointment.Lilly carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

299,INCY,"At the beginning of 2017, expectations were pretty high that the pharma and biotech sector would finally see lots of mergers and acquisitions (M&As). However, that did not happen. While a few high-value deals were announced, the focus was mostly on small bolt-on acquisitions and licensing deals and agreements.According to Mergermarket’s Global Pharma, Medical & Biotech trend report for Q317, M&A in the global pharma, medical and biotechnology sector was in the range of $207.6 billion spanning 1,040 deals so far this year, declining 9.9% from the year-ago period. The dip was mostly attributable to the pharma and medical sectors.Key deals announced this year include the Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report)-Kite and the Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report)-Actelion acquisitions, which boosted the value of M&A transactions in the biotech sector. Biotech stocks continue to command hefty premiums where M&A is concerned.The key question now facing the sector is - will M&A activity remain sluggish in 2018 or will there be a surge in M&A deals?  With tax reform in the works, M&A activity is expected to increase in the upcoming quarters. Tax reform and cash repatriation are expected to lead to a boost in this area with biotech remaining a highly sought-after sector. Companies with innovative technologies and pipelines remain in demand with disease areas like nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”), immuno-oncology, gastrointestinal and central nervous system diseases seeing quite a bit of activity. Treatments for orphan diseases and gene editing technology are also in demand.There are several large drugmakers that are on the lookout for deals – while some of these companies are looking to replace sales of blockbuster products that are facing loss of patent exclusivity, others are looking to build their pipelines both through acquisitions as well as licensing agreements.Expectations are high that big players like Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report), Pfizer, Merck and Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) will announce M&A deals in 2018. Companies like J&J and Gilead are also expected to be on the lookout for additional acquisition targets. A major deterrent, however, could be high valuations and bidding wars which could keep some of the key players on the sidelines.   In this backdrop, here is a look at three biotech stocks that could find themselves on the radar of companies on the lookout for acquisition targets in 2018.Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report): Wilmington, DE-based Incyte is a company that is often considered an attractive acquisition target thanks to its flagship product, Jakafi, and a promising pipeline. Jakafi – a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor – looks well-positioned for growth. Jakafi revenues are expected in the range of $1,125-$1,135 million in 2017. Incyte is also working on expanding Jakafi’s label into additional indications including steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease (“GVHD” – data expected in the first half of 2018) and essential thrombocythemia (“ET”), a rare blood cancer that can lead to life-threatening complications.The company has several catalysts lined up for 2018 including the potential approval of baricitinib (resubmission of the new drug application for moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis expected by January 2018) as well as the advancement of its immuno-oncology pipeline.The company’s immuno-oncology pipeline includes IDO1 inhibitors (epacadostat), PI3K-delta inhibitors (INCB50465), and JAK inhibitors (itacitinib, INCB52793) among others. Epacadostat, which is in late-stage development for melanoma with data due in the first half of 2018, has immense commercial potential. Epacadostat is being evaluated for several other types of cancer as well.Juno Therapeutics, Inc. : Biopharmaceutical company, Juno’s shares have been on an upward trend following the Gilead-Kite acquisition announcement earlier this year. With Juno being focused on the development of innovative cellular immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer, the company is considered a potential acquisition target. Juno’s cell-based cancer immunotherapies are based on chimeric antigen receptor and high-affinity T cell receptor technologies. The company has several cell-based candidates in its pipeline targeting a variety of B-cell malignancies as well as multiple solid tumors and multiple myeloma.Although the company suffered a major setback with the development of its erstwhile lead pipeline candidate due to safety issues (including patient deaths), Juno is now focusing on JCAR017, a next-generation CAR-T cell product that targets CD19. JCAR017 is currently in a registrational study for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (""NHL""). The company expects to file for approval in the second half of 2018.  Juno’s shares are up 211.1% year to date, compared to the 2.7% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to.bluebird bio, Inc. (BLUE  -  Free Report): bluebird is another clinical-stage company working on developing gene therapies for serious genetic diseases and T cell-based immunotherapies for cancer. The company’s pipeline includes Lenti-D, currently in a phase II/III study, for the treatment of cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, and LentiGlobin, currently in five studies for the treatment of transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia and severe sickle cell disease. The company’s lead oncology programs, bb2121 and bb21217, are anti-BCMA CAR T programs which are being developed in collaboration with Celgene.While Incyte, Juno and bluebird are all Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks, you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

300,INCY,"Investors who can accurately distinguish between overpriced and rightly priced stocks emerge as winners at the end. However, in this tricky market place, these two types of stocks are inter-mixed in such a way that it is very tough to differentiate them. Investors who can appropriately spot toxic stocks and discard them at the right time are likely to gain.Generally, the overhyped toxic stocks are exposed to external shocks and are burdened with high amount of debts. Also, the price of the toxic stocks is unreasonably high. The irrationally high price of the toxic stocks is only transitory in nature as their intrinsic value is lower than the current bloated price.The overblown price of toxic stocks can be attributed to either an irrational exuberance associated with them or some deep-rooted drawbacks in the stock. Owning such stocks for a long stretch of time may result into huge erosion of wealth.On the other hand, investors may gain from the accurate identification of toxic stocks with the help of an investing strategy called short selling. This strategy allows you to sell a stock first and then buy it when the price falls.While short selling excels in bear markets, it typically loses money in bull markets.So, pointing out toxic stocks and removing them at the right time is the key to safeguard your portfolio from big losses. Profits can be made by short selling them.Screening CriteriaHere is a winning strategy that will help you to identify overpriced toxic stocks:Most recent Debt/Equity Ratio greater than the median industry average: High debt/equity ratio implies high leverage. High leverage indicates a huge level of repayment that the company has to make in connection with the debt amount.P/E using 12-month forward EPS estimate greater than 50: A very high forward P/E implies that a stock is highly overvalued.% Change in F (1) and F (2) Estimate (12 Weeks) less than -5: Negative EPS estimate revision for this and the next fiscal year during the past 12 weeks points to analysts’ pessimism.Zacks Rank more than or equal to #3 (Hold): We have not considered Buy-rated stocks that generally outperform the market.Here are five of the 17 toxic stocks that showed up on the screen:PTC Inc. (PTC  -  Free Report) is a Needham, MA-based software company engaged in developing, marketing and supporting software solutions. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter earnings remained unchanged at 37 cents. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #3.

301,INCY,"Last week, we issued an article where we mentioned that mergers and acquisitions, which were quite lean in 2017, may pick up significantly in 2018 if the proposed tax reforms are finally approved.The reforms aim to cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, which can boost profits of large drug/biotech companies. The change in tax code will also allow companies to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one-time tax rate of 10%.These changes will definitely leave more cash in the hands of drug/biotech companies. Also, with focus on drug pricing taking a backseat and large drug/biotech companies struggling with organic growth, there is a lot of chatter about a possible increase in large M&As in 2018.Given that it takes several years and millions of dollars to develop new therapeutics from scratch, large pharmaceutical companies sitting on huge piles of cash may prefer to buy innovative small/mid cap biotech companies to build out their pipelines.In this article, we discuss some mid- and large-cap names that may be logical acquisition targets next year for companies like Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and others. What matters for buying a drug/biotech stock is the current sales performance of its drugs/products, prospects of future sales growth, and the quality of the pipeline.The four companies we discuss have most of these factors going in their favor. Acquisitions of small-cap drug/biotech companies are very difficult to predict and quite frequent. Hence, these have been excluded from the discussion.BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BMRN  -  Free Report)Companies whose product/pipeline portfolio includes rare disease drugs are in great demand as it is a less competitive space and the expensive treatments can bring in huge profits. BioMarin is one such drug developer. Its market cap is around $14 billion.BioMarin’s key orphan disease drugs – Vimizim and Kuvan – continue to do well, backed by strong underlying patient demand trends. BioMarin expects sustained growth in both the drugs. Brineura’s earlier-than-expected approval this year for the treatment of children with CLN2 disease, a form of Batten disease, was also a huge boost for BioMarin.Its impressive rare disease pipeline is also progressing well with approval for pegvaliase for the treatment of phenylketonuria expected in 2018. On the pipeline, we believe both late-stage candidates – vosoritide - for achondroplasia, the most common form of dwarfism, and BMN27 – for hemophilia A -  have blockbuster potential.BioMarin has already been the target of takeover speculation. Companies like Gilead (GILD), Amgen (AMGN) and Roche may be interested in buying BioMarin.Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (VRTX  -  Free Report)For Vertex, 2017 so far has been a tremendous year with positive data read-outs and regulatory approvals leading to an increase in eligible patient population for its two approved cystic fibrosis (CF) - Kalydeco & Orkambi. CF is Vertex’s main area of focus. With a consistent expansion in patient population, Vertex’s CF product revenues have increased quarter to quarter throughout 2017.The company is optimistic that the positive trend of CF sales will continue in 2018 as it gains additional reimbursement approvals for Orkambi in ex-U.S. markets and gets approval to launch tezacaftor(VX-661)/ivacaftor combination medicine.Meanwhile, the company has also made decent clinical progress across multiple CF studies this year and has meaningful pipeline catalysts. The market cap of Vertex is around $36 billion.Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) Incyte’s strong oncology portfolio makes it a lucrative target for companies like Gilead, Amgen and Bristol Myers. The market cap of Incyte is more than $20 billion.The primary reason why Incyte is ripe for buyout is its two products on the market, Jakafi and Iclusig.Jakafi, a JAK inhibitor, is the first and the only product to be approved by the polycythemia vera (PV) and myelofibrosis (“MF”) – two rare blood cancers. Jakafi is seeing strong sales performance driven by strong patient demand for both indications.  In order to expand the patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug, the company is working on expanding its label further. Iclusig is approved for chronic myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Meanwhile, Incyte’s pipeline boasts candidates like immune therapy epacadostat — being studied in combination with anti-PD-L1 agents of Merck, Bristol Myers and others — and Olumiant for rheumatoid arthritis – approved in Europe and regulatory application to be filed in the United States in January 2018.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report)Like BioMarin, Alexion is also focused on the development and commercialization of life-transforming drugs for the treatment of patients with ultra-rare disorders. Its key drug is Soliris, approved for two severe and ultra-rare disorders — paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) — have been consistently doing well. Meanwhile, Alexion is working on expanding the drug’s label to include additional indications, which if approved, can boost further sales growth. It has two other drugs for rare diseases called Strensiq and Kanuma, which are emerging as growth drivers. Alexion also has a robust pipeline of several candidates under development including Soliris follow-up candidate, ALXN1210.Roche, Pfizer, or Novartis may be interested in buying Alexion. The market cap of Alexion is more than $25 billion.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

302,INCY,"The pharma and biotech sectors have made a nice comeback this year with the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index gaining 11.7%, while the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index is up 17.7% year to date. This is in sharp contrast to 2016, which saw pharma and biotech stocks under a lot of pressure with the sector facing intense criticism for rising drug prices.Drug pricing was not the only reason for the sector’s underperformance last year. A fewer number of drug approvals, high-profile pipeline failures, slower-than-expected new product launches and increasing competition were some of the other factors that weighed on the sector.However, factors like ramp up in new product sales, R&D success and innovation, strong results, a higher number of FDA approvals and continued strong performance from key products have contributed to a sustained recovery in the sector in 2017.Importantly, investors now seem more comfortable with the drug pricing scenario and are focusing more on the fundamentals of the sector. So what are the factors that could drive the sector’s performance? First and foremost, this is an industry that will continue to witness demand for its products given an aging population and the increasing prevalence of a wide variety of diseases. Strong pipelines, innovative treatments, impressive results, and increased health care spending should support growth. A faster drug approval process and the proposed removal of outdated regulations that drive up costs and slow down innovation should also provide benefits. The sector will receive an additional boost if more mergers & acquisitions (M&As) are announced in the coming quarters.But drug pricing will remain a headline risk until there is more clarity on the situation. Other challenges for the sector include the growing presence of biosimilars, generic competition, a slowdown in the growth of legacy products and major pipeline setbacks.How to Pick WinnersAnyone interested in biotech and pharma stocks will know that it could be challenging to pick winners in this “high risk - high returns” industry which is constantly growing and changing. Companies which hit the bull’s eye become overnight success stories with shares doubling or even tripling on positive news. However, negative outcomes have an equally strong effect on the shares and failure may very well spell doom for these companies.In such a scenario, let’s take a look at stocks preferred by analysts who have a deep knowledge and understanding of the industry and its companies. We have zeroed in on five stocks with the help of our Zacks Stock Screener - these stocks have been given a Strong Buy or Buy rating by 80% or more brokers and sport a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy).Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. (SGMO  -  Free Report): California-based Sangamo is a clinical-stage biotech company that is focused on translating ground-breaking science into genomic therapies using its platform technologies in genome editing, gene therapy, gene regulation and cell therapy. The company has partnership agreements with big players like Pfizer (hemophilia A), Shire (Huntington’s disease) and Bioverativ (beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease). In the next 8-12 months, Sangamo expects proof-of-concept data on SB-525 (hemophilia A), SB-FIX (hemophilia B), SB-318 (MPS I) and SB-319 (MPS II). Other value drivers could be the signing of partnership deals for the company’s central nervous system/tau and oncology assets.Sangamo is a Zacks Rank #2 stock with 85.7% Strong Buy or Buy broker rating. Shares of Sangamo are up 445.9% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 2.6% rally.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.

303,INCY,"Shares of Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) were down 3.4% after the company reported a loss in the second quarter of 2017.Incyte reported a loss of 6 cents, a penny wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 5 cents. Incyte had reported earnings of 18 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Quarterly revenues were $326.4 million, up 32.5% year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $318.4 million. The top line was driven by higher sales of Jakafi in the U.S. and Iclusig in Europe as well as royalties from ex-U.S. sales of Jakavi and Olumiant.Incyte’s shares have moved up 28.4% in the year so far compared with the industry’s 9.0% gain.Quarter in DetailJakafi sales grew 33%, year over year to $276 million. Net product revenue of Iclusig amounted to $15.7 million. Product royalty revenues from Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) for the commercialization of Jakafi in ex-U.S. markets grew 34% to $34.8 million.Research and development expenses were up to $201.8 million from $120.3 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to the expansion of the portfolio as well as upfront and milestone expenses of $209 million related to collaboration and license agreements. Selling, general and administration (SG&A) expenses amounted to $90.1 million, up 34.8% year over year.2017 Outlook UpdatedThe company now expects Jakafi revenues in the range of $1,090–$1,120 million, up from $1,020–$1,070 million. Iclusig revenues are expected in the range of $60–$65 million.R&D expenses are now expected in the range of $1,050–1,150 million, up from the earlier forecast of $1,000–1,100 billion due to the acceleration of the phase III plans for epacadostat. SG&A expenses are still expected in the range of $340–$360 million. Incyte Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Incyte Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Incyte Corporation QuotePipeline UpdateA phase III trial, REACH3 evaluating Jakafi as a treatment for patients with steroid-refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is expected was initiated in Jun 2017. The pivotal program, RESET-272 evaluating Jakafi versus anagrelide in patients with essential thrombocythemia is now open for enrolment and first patient will be dosed in the coming weeks.A phase III trial, GRAVITAS-301, on itacitinib, in patients with treatment-naïve acute GVHD, was initiated in July.Earlier in 2017, Incyte extended its collaboration with Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) for the pivotal program studying epacadostat in combination with Keytruda to a total of five tumor types. Incyte and Merck will advance four additional tumor types beyond melanoma – non-small cell lung cancer, bladder, renal and head & neck cancers – across six phase III trials. These trials are expected to begin in2017.Additionally, Incyte extended its collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) evaluating epacadostat in combination with Opdivo in pivotal studies in two tumor types (planned initiation before 2017 end).The European Commission approved Olumiant in Feb 2017 for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. The drug was approved in Japan too. However, the company suffered a setback when the FDA issued a complete response letter for Olumiant in which the FDA indicated that additional clinical data are needed to determine the most appropriate doses. The FDA further stated that additional data are necessary to further characterize safety concerns across treatment arms. In Jul 2017, Lilly and Incyte announced that the resubmission of the New Drug Application (NDA) for Olumiant will be delayed for a period anticipated to be a minimum of 18 months. Both companies will be further evaluating future plans with the agency and analyse options for resubmission, including the potential for an additional clinical study, as requested by the FDA.Our TakeIncyte reported a wider-than-expected loss in the second quarter. Nevertheless, the revenue beat was impressive. Jakafi sales were driven by patient demand and are expected boost revenues. The increase in sales guidance was also encouraging.While most of the demand is due to a larger established patient base in myelofibrosis, polycythemiavera is also expected to be a major long-term driver of Jakafi growth. This is owing to the larger potential patient population and the possibility for longer duration of treatment. Jakafi was included as a recommended treatment for patients with myelofibrosis and patients with polycythemiavera in the latest National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) in Jul 2017. This is likely to boost demand further.However, the delay in NDA submission of Olumiant in the U.S. is disappointing.Zacks RankIncyte currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Of these, 57.7% companies beat both on both counts compared with 55.6% in the first quarter.Total earnings for these 286 index members were up 11.3% from the year-ago quarter on a 6.1% improvement in revenues. The beat ratio was 74.5% for earnings and 69.2% for revenues. The Medical segment has also performed well so far with earnings up 6% on 4.7% increase in revenues.Per the report, total earnings for S&P 500 companies in the second quarter are expected to grow 9.2% year over year on 5% higher revenues. With plenty of results still to come, the actual earnings growth this quarter may exceed the 10% mark. This follows 13.3% earnings growth in the first quarter on 7% increase in revenues, the highest in almost two years.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) began the earnings season for the pharma sector with mixed second-quarter results. Performance of Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) were encouraging as the companies beat both earnings and revenue estimates. Lilly and Biogen also raised their earnings and revenue estimates for 2017. Among other pharma bigwigs which reported last week, AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected results with both earnings and sales surpassing expectations. Its lymphoma drug, Imbruvica recorded record growth. Merck & Co., Inc.

305,INCY,"Yesterday, big pharma player, Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected second quarter results and raised its outlook for the year. However, shares were down 3% with investors focusing on the company’s update regarding its investigational rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, baricitinib.Here is a look at a few key takeaways from Lilly’s conference call.How Did Key Drugs Perform?Lilly’s second quarter 2017 revenues increased 8% from the year-ago quarter to $5.8 billion, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.6 billion. New products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Jardiance, Lartruvo and Cyramza performed well and drove volume growth. Late life cycle products like Cialis and Forteo drove price growth.Alimta continued to face significant competitive headwinds while Zyprexa, Cymbalta, Evista, Strattera and Axiron were impacted by loss of exclusivity. Cialis was also affected by lower volume in the U.S. reflecting a decline in the overall erectile disorder (ED) market as well as the presence of generics.Animal health revenue declined during the quarter reflecting market access pressure and competitive pressure in cattle and swine (Read more: Lilly Q2 Earnings Top, Baricitinib Re-Filing Delayed).Baricitinib Facing Significant DelayLilly announced that there will be a delay of at least 18 months in the resubmission of the regulatory application for baricitinib, which is being developed in collaboration with Incyte (INCY  -  Free Report). This means the resubmission will not take place this year.The FDA had issued a complete response letter (CRL) for baricitinib earlier this year in April. At that time, the agency had told the companies that it is unable to approve baricitinib, a once-daily oral medication for the treatment of moderate-to-severe RA, in its current form. The FDA had asked for additional clinical data to determine the most appropriate doses as well as to further characterize safety concerns across treatment arms.Although Lilly disagrees with the FDA's conclusions and believes the comprehensive clinical data supports a positive benefit-risk profile, the company will enter into discussions with the FDA to determine the kind of study needed to better define the benefit-risk profile of baricitinib.Meanwhile, Lilly and Incyte have plans to explore baricitinib for other indications with a late-stage study in psoriatic arthritis slated to commence next year while studies in atopic dermatitis and lupus continue. Phase II atopic dermatitis data will be presented at a scientific forum by year end.We note that baricitinib was approved in the EU under the trade name Olumiant in Feb 2017. The European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recently agreed that the label should be updated to include a precaution for patients who have risk factors for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Oncology R&D StrategyLilly provided an in-depth look at its oncology R&D strategy. The company’s strategy involves building on key treatments like Cyramza, Lartruvo and abemaciclib as foundational agents while it will focus on developing new standard-of-care changing therapies that clear a very high bar and will span a variety of mechanisms including immune-oncology. For now, Lilly will focus on seven candidates for priority internal development and three additional candidates (Ang2 MAb, CSF1R MAb and merestinib) with study data pending. The rest of the molecules in the pipeline will be partnered.The seven molecules that have made it to Lilly’s priority development list include abemaciclib which is already under FDA review, TIM-3 MAb, PD-L1 MAb, Erk 1/2 inhibitor, TGFb RI KI, PI3/mTOR inhibitor and prexasertib. About 10 molecules are earmarked for external or partnered development -- while three of these assets are owned by third parties, Lilly is looking for partners for the remaining seven -- a FGFR-3 ADC, ralimetinib, a FGFR inhibitor, a notch inhibitor, galunisertib, a CXCR4 peptide antagonist and emibetuzumab.Bottom LineAlthough Lilly delivered a “beat and raise” quarter, the company’s results got overshadowed by the baricitinib update. Investors were disappointed by the delay in the resubmission of the baricitinib regulatory filing in the U.S. with the company saying that there could be a minimum delay of 18 months. With several products facing generic competition and competitive pressure increasing, Lilly needs to focus on bringing new products to market. The company’s decision to prioritize its oncology pipeline makes sense. Lilly is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock -- you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Year-to-date, Lilly’s shares have gained 11.8%, just about topping the industry’s 11.2% rally.Watch out for earnings reports from other large cap pharma companies like Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report). Merck, a Zacks Rank #2 stock has a pretty good earnings track record having surpassed expectations in each of the last four quarters with an average surprise of 4.36%. Merck will be reporting Q2 results on Jul 28.Pfizer’s track record is mixed with the company topping expectations in two of the last four quarters. Pfizer, which will be reporting on Aug 1, has a positive Earnings ESP of 1.54% for the second quarter.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

306,INCY,"Key biotech stocks, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) reported second quarter results yesterday -- both companies surpassed earnings and sales estimates. There were several other key updates as well from companies like Incyte (INCY  -  Free Report) and The Medicines Co. (MDCO  -  Free Report).  Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesAmgen, Biogen Q2 Earnings: Biogen’s results were strong with the company’s most recent offering, Spinraza (spinal muscular atrophy - SMA), doing better than expected. Meanwhile, the company’s multiple sclerosis (MS) franchise continued to grow. MS is Biogen’s key area of expertise. Biogen expects the early 2020s to be an inflection point for the company with its key pipeline candidates expected to launch during that period (Read more: Biogen Tops Q2 Earnings & Sales, Spinraza Sales Up).  Amgen also topped estimates and updated its guidance. Recently launched products including Prolia (the second and fourth quarters are typically the strongest for this product), Repatha and Kyprolis recorded strong volume-driven growth. Amgen is working on improving Repatha patient access across the world. Meanwhile, mature products like Enbrel, Epogen, Neulasta and Neupogen declined with Neupogen being impacted by short-acting biosimilar competition that will continue affecting sales.While Amgen stock has gained 23.7% year to date (YTD), outperforming the 11.5% rally of the industry it belongs to, Biogen has lagged with shares declining 0.2% YTD.Incyte/Lilly RA Drug Faces At Least 18-Month Delay in Resubmission: Incyte and partner Lilly announced that there will be a delay of at least 18 months in the resubmission of the regulatory application for their investigational rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, baricitinib. This means the resubmission will not take place this year. Incyte and Lilly will discuss the path forward with the FDA and evaluate options for resubmission including the possibility of conducting an additional study as required by the FDA.The FDA had issued a complete response letter (CRL) for baricitinib earlier this year in April. At that time, the agency had told the companies that it is unable to approve baricitinib, a once-daily oral medication for the treatment of moderate-to-severe RA, in its current form. The FDA had asked for additional clinical data to determine the most appropriate doses as well as to further characterize safety concerns across treatment arms.We note that baricitinib was approved in the EU under the trade name Olumiant in Feb 2017. The European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recently agreed that the label should be updated to include a precaution for patients who have risk factors for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Incyte’s shares were down 3.4% on the baricitinib update.Nektar Up on Lilly Deal: Nektar (NKTR  -  Free Report) entered into a deal with big pharma company Lilly which will see Nektar receiving $150 million upfront as well as up to $250 million in the form of milestone payments. The deal covers the co-development of an early stage asset, NKTR-358, in Nektar’s pipeline. NKTR-358, which has the potential to treat a number of autoimmune and other chronic inflammatory conditions, works by targeting the IL-2 receptor complex in the body. By activating regulatory T cells, NKTR-358 has the potential to bring the immune system back into balance.Other deal terms include sharing of phase II development costs (Lilly: 75%; Nektar: 25%), an option for Nektar to participate in late-stage development on an indication-by-indication basis and double-digit royalties for Nektar. The deal is a major win for Nektar considering the early-stage nature of the candidate and the hefty upfront fee. Lilly will make a strong partner for the company. Nektar’s shares were up following the deal announcement.  Ironwood Down on Heartburn Drug Data: Ironwood’s (IRWD  -  Free Report) shares were down even though the company reported positive data on IW-3718 from a mid-stage study conducted in patients with uncontrolled gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The study met its primary endpoint but failed to impress investors with the efficacy results falling short of expectations. Ironwood intends to conduct end of phase II meetings with the FDA and move the candidate into phase III studies in the second half of 2018. According to the company, IW-3718 represents immense commercial potential with annual peak sales opportunity of more than $2 billion (Read more: Ironwood Reports Positive Data on Reflux Candidate).CHMP Positive on Regeneron/Sanofi Eczema Drug: Regeneron and Sanofi are a step closer to gaining EU approval for their eczema treatment, Dupixent, with the CHMP adopting a positive opinion for the drug. The companies are seeking approval for use in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) who are candidates for systemic therapy. A final decision regarding approval should be out in the coming months. Dupixent gained FDA approval earlier this year in March. Dupixent has blockbuster potential and is being investigated for other indications as well.Detailed Data on Gilead HIV Regimen: Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) announced detailed 48-week results from a couple of late-stage studies on a fixed-dose combination of bictegravir (a novel investigational INSTI) and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF, a dual-NRTI backbone) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in treatment-naïve adults. The bictegravir-containing regimen was found to be non-inferior to dolutegravir-containing regimens. Gilead holds a strong position in the HIV market and is working on strengthening its franchise. There is significant demand for a simple, convenient dosing regimen that can sustain virologic suppression with a safety profile that is appropriate for most HIV patients.MDCO’s TANGO-2 Stopped Early on Superior Benefit-Risk: The Medicines Co. got some good news with an independent data safety and monitoring board stopping a late-stage study on its investigational antibiotic, Vabomere (previously referred to as Carbavance) based on an interim analysis. Interim results from the TANGO-2 study showed that Vabomere improved clinical cure rates across all infection types and reduced rate of renal adverse events compared to best available therapy.Vabomere is currently under priority FDA review with a response expected in the third quarter. A marketing application was filed in the EU as well.

307,INCY,"Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $1.11, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.04 by 6.7%. Earnings rose 29% from the year-ago quarter backed by volume driven pharma sales growth and higher profits.Revenues BeatQuarterly revenues of $5.82 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.59 billion by 4.2%. Sales grew 8% year over year backed by higher volumes and realized prices. However, foreign exchange pulled down sales by 1%.Volumes rose 5% as higher volumes of new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Jardiance and Lartruvo offset lower volumes of established products like Zyprexa, Alimta, Cialis and Strattera.Pharmaceutical volumes rose 8% in the quarter. However, worldwide competitive pressure hurt sales in Lilly’s Animal Health segment.Revenue in DetailU.S. revenues grew 15% to $3.32 billion, reflecting higher volume of products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Jardiance and Lartruvo, which offset lower volumes of established drugs.Ex-U.S. revenues declined 1% to $2.5 billion mainly due to lower volumes, increased competition and lower realized prices. Higher volumes of newer products like Cyramza and Trulicity were offset by lower volumes of Zyprexa, Cymbalta and Alimta due to the loss of exclusivity. Cymbalta has lost exclusivity in Europe and Canada, Zyprexa in Japan and Alimta in several countries. Lower sales of food and companion animal products hurt outside U.S. sales as well.Established products that recorded growth during the quarter include Forteo (up 22% to $446.7 million), Humulin (up 8% to $357.8 million) and Effient (up 6% to $142.9 million).Alimta sales, however, declined 12% to $532.9 million, reflecting lower demand in the U.S. due to competitive pressure, mainly from immuno-oncology agents. Outside the U.S., sales of Alimta were hurt by loss of exclusivity in several countries, increased competition and lower realized prices.Zyprexa sales declined 33% to $140.8 million due to loss of exclusivity.Humalog sales decreased 3% in the quarter to $678.4 million due to lower realized prices and volumes in the U.S.Cialis sales were flat at $627.3 million hurt by lower demand in the U.S. as well as increased competition from generic sildenafilErbitux sales declined 12% to $159.1 million in the quarter. Strattera sales declined 17% to $186.6 million. Cymbalta sales declined 13% to $206.6 million.Among new products, Trulicity generated revenues of $480.2 million, up 139% year over year, with U.S. revenues benefiting from growth in the GLP-1 market and market share gains.Cyramza revenues were $186.3 million, up 27% year over year, backed mainly by higher outside U.S. revenues. Cyramza’s ex-U.S. revenues benefited from strong volumes in Japan. However, U.S. revenues increased only 1% as higher realized prices made up for lower demand due to competitive pressure.Jardiance sales (up 157% to $103.2 million) were driven by increased market share within the growing SGLT2 class.Basaglar recorded revenues of $86.6 million compared with $46.0 million in the previous quarter. Basaglar - Lilly and partner Boehringer Ingelheim’s follow-on insulin to Sanofi’s (SNY  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug, Lantus - was launched in the U.S. in mid-Dec 2016 where it generated revenues of $59.5 million in the quarter.Taltz brought in sales of $138.7 million compared with $96.6 million in the previous quarter, reflecting strong launch uptake.Lartruvo (olaratumab) generated revenues of $47.4 million in the second quarter of 2017 compared with $42.1 million in the previous quarter. Lartruvo was launched in the U.S. and the EU for soft tissue sarcoma in the fourth quarter of 2016. U.S. revenues were $39.7 million compared with $36 million in the previous quarter.Meanwhile, Lilly and partner Incyte Corporation’s (INCY  -  Free Report) rheumatoid arthritis (RA) drug Olumiant (baricitinib) was approved in EU in Feb 2017. The drug generated sales of $4.8 million in the second quarter of 2017 compared with $1.9 million in the previous quarter. The drug received marketing approval in Japan earlier this month.However, in the U.S., the companies received a complete response letter (CRL) from the FDA in April regarding the new drug application (NDA) for baricitinib. Concurrent with the earnings release, Lilly announced that the NDA resubmission for baricitinib will not occur this year and will be delayed by a minimum of 18 months. The company said that the FDA has indicated that an additional clinical study will be needed for a resubmission.Lilly's Animal Health segment sales declined 9% to $784.8 million despite inclusion of revenues from the acquisition of Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica's U.S. feline, canine and rabies (acquired in Jan 2017). Animal Health revenues were hurt due to global competitive pressure that affected sales of both food animal and companion animal revenues in the quarter.Gross Margin & Operating Income RiseAdjusted gross margin of 76.7% in the quarter increased 70 basis points primarily driven by higher realized prices and manufacturing efficiencies.Operating income increased 31% to $1.51 billion on higher gross margins. Operating expenses remained flat in the quarter. However, total operating expenses, as a percent of revenues, declined 390 basis points in the quarter.2017 Outlook UppedLilly raised its previously issued 2017 adjusted earnings and sales outlook. Adjusted earnings per share are now expected in the range of $4.10 to $4.20 compared with $4.05 to $4.15 previously. Revenues are expected in the range of $22.0–$22.5 billion compared with $21.8–$22.3 billion expected previously. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and revenues is $4.12 per share and $22.18 billion, respectively.Gross margin is expected to be approximately 76%, lower than 77% previously. Adjusted tax rate is still expected to be approximately 22%.Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are still expected in the range of $6.4–$6.6 billion, while research and development expenses are projected to be $5.0-$5.2 billion, slightly higher than $4.9–$5.1 billion expected previously.Our TakeLilly’s second-quarter 2017 results were strong with the company beating estimates on both counts. The pharma giant also raised its sales and earnings outlook for the year. However, the news of the delay in re-filing for baricitinib sent shares down almost 2% in pre-market trading. So far this year, Lilly’s share price has risen 15.2% compared with an increase of 11.8% for the industry.The company also said that it will build on its oncology portfolio and work on developing next-generation immunotherapies. It will prioritize development of seven pipeline candidates.Going forward, new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Cyramza, Jardiance and Lartruvo are expected to see higher revenues. Lilly also expects some established products like Trajenta, Forteo and Humalog to continue doing well. However, Alimta will continue to be impacted by competition. Other headwinds include competition from immuno-oncology agents as well as loss of exclusivity for many drugs in emerging markets. Meanwhile, the recent high-profile pipeline setbacks are an investor concern and so is the weak performance of the Animal Health segment in the first half.Lilly carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

308,INCY,"Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and partner Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) announced that its pipeline candidate, baricitinib, met the primary endpoint in a phase II study in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD), a type of eczema.So far this year, Lilly’s shares have underperformed the industry. While, the stock has been up 12.9%, the industry gained 17%.Notably, the results showed that after 16 weeks of treatment, 61% of patients treated with baricitinib (4 mg) in plus topical corticosteroid (TCS) achieved a 50% or greater improvement in the signs and symptoms of AD versus 37% in patients treated with TCS alone. Thereby, suggesting that baricitinib may have the potential to become an oral treatment option for patients suffering from atopic dermatitis who are unable to achieve adequate control with topical steroids.  However, in patients treated with the 2 mg dose group of baricitinib in combination with TCS, the primary endpoint was not statistically different compared to treatment with TCS alone. At four weeks of treatment, 68% of patients treated with baricitinib (4-mg) plus TCS combination and 62% of patients treated with baricitinib (2-mg )plus TCS combination witnessed an improvement in the signs and symptoms of AD compared to 16% of patients in TCS alone.Therefore, based on the phase II results, Lilly and Incyte plan to initiate a phase III study for atopic dermatitis later this year.Baricitinib, a once-daily oral medication, is already marketed in the EU by the trade name of Olumiant for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).We remind the investors that in the United States the FDA had issued a complete response letter (CRL) for baricitinib’s new drug application (NDA) for rheumatoid arthritis in April. In fact, the FDA had asked for additional clinical data to determine the most appropriate doses as well as to further characterize safety concerns across treatment arms.In July, Lilly had declared that the NDA resubmission for baricitinib will not occur in 2017 and will be delayed by a minimum of 18 months.But, in August, Lilly and Incyte announced that they will re-submit the NDA for baricitinib much faster than previously expected. To this end, the NDA is expected to be re-submitted in January, 2018.Consequently, the company expects the revised submission, which will include new safety and efficacy data, to be classified by the FDA as a Class II resubmission. A decision from the FDA is therefore expected in six months. Importantly, a new clinical study will not be required.Markedly, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
