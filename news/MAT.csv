5,MAT,"The demise of Toys R Us Inc. took a toll on Hasbro (HAS), which posted worse-than-expected results in the first quarter.Hasbro posted declining sales in all business areas in the quarter, sending shares down as much as 9.1% in early trading. The toy maker said the drop was a result of the Toys R Us liquidation, as well as ""uncertainty"" in some operations and excess inventory in Europe.""We are working to put the near-term disruption from Toys R Us behind us,"" Chief Executive Officer Brian Goldner said in a statement.The retailer, one of Hasbro's largest customers, filed for bankruptcy in September, had a terrible fourth quarter and then announced the liquidation of several divisions, including the U.S. This has presented another hurdle for toymakers that were already dealing with slowing growth and concerns that the success of making so many products based off an ever-growing slate of kids entertainment is waning.The Toys R Us effect could be clearly seen in Hasbro's results. In North America, sales sank 19%. Revenue dropped even more in Europe with a decline of 28%. The liquidation also generated expenses of $61.4 million.The world's largest publicly traded toy maker, based in Pawtucket, R.I., lost $112.5 million in the quarter, versus a profit of $68.6 million a year earlier. Sales of franchise brands, which include Transformers and My Little Pony, collapsed 19% to $361.7 million.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseGoldner has said that revenue will take a hit this year, but other retailers, like drugstores and dollar chains, will fill the market void left by Toys R Us by 2019.""Our global retailers view this as an opportunity in a key consumer category and are partnering with Hasbro to develop growth plans for our brands,"" he said.Shares of Hasbro dropped as low as $75.30 in premarket trading. They had declined 8.9% this year through Friday's close.The first quarter, which runs through March, is Hasbro's smallest by revenue. This is usually when toy makers are rebuilding inventory for the rest of the year.Overall sales in the period sank 16% to $716.3 million, the company said. Analysts had estimated $821.2 million on average. Excluding the Toys R Us costs and other items, profit dropped to 10 cents a share, compared with projections for 32 cents.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Retail & E-Commerce Stocks And Industry NewsBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

7,MAT,"Apple (AAPL) reportedly is gearing up for a host of spring product launches, including a wireless charging mat for its devices and possibly second-generation wireless earbuds.X Apple is expected to release its AirPower wireless charging mat in the second half of March, according to the Apple Post news website. Japanese blog Macotakara made a similar claim on Friday. The mat is large enough to charge up to three devices simultaneously, such as an iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods wireless earbuds. Pricing for the accessory has not been announced.Apple introduced the AirPower charging pad on Sept. 12 when it unveiled the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X, its first handsets capable of wireless charging. At the time, Apple said it would release the AirPower sometime in 2018. The device uses the Qi wireless charging standard, which is supported by Belkin, Zagg (ZAGG) subsidiary Mophie and others.Apple is likely to introduce a wireless charging case for its AirPods earbuds when it comes out with AirPower, Computerworld reported Friday.Meanwhile, Apple is working on a new generation of AirPods, which could come this year, Bloomberg reported Thursday. The new earbuds are said to have an upgraded wireless chip for managing Bluetooth connections and support for ""Hey Siri"" activation. With the current version, users have to physically tap the headphones to activate the Siri digital assistant program. With the next version, they'll be able to use their voice to activate the program by saying ""Hey Siri.""A subsequent model of AirPods under development would be water resistant, Bloomberg said. That third-generation product could be released as early as next year.Apple introduced the first AirPods in September 2016 alongside the iPhone 7 as a way to replace the traditional wired headphone jack. The wireless earbuds became available in December 2016.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportApple also is rumored to be planning a revamp of its entry-level iPhone SE smartphone, which could be announced as early as this quarter.

8,MAT,"The F-35 is preparing for key operational tests that will allow Lockheed Martin (LMT) to begin full-rate production on the stealth fighter and massively boost its growth.XAcquisition rules require the completion of combat testing certification, or Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E), before Lockheed can crank out F-35s at full tilt.The F-35 underwent cold-weather testing at Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska, in February, as part pre-IOT&E activity. Then last month, the F-35 went through more pre-IOT&E tests at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., to evaluate close air support and combat search and rescue capabilities.Actual IOT&E, which includes rigorous combat testing, is scheduled to start in September (more than a year behind schedule) and finish by May 2019. That event will also test the F-35's 3F software package, which provides 100% of the coding needed for full warfighting capability.It will also pit the F-35 against the venerable A-10 in a close air support matchup that Congress mandated amid a fierce debate over the A-10's future.The F-35 is supposed to fill the close air support role left by the A-10, but critics say the stealthy fighter doesn't have the same amount of firepower or survivability in combat and instead called on the Air Force to put off the planned retirement of the so-called Warthog.Lockheed has a lot riding on the tests.The F-35 program is key to Lockheed's growth as it accounts for about 25% of total revenue. The company has been steadily boosting its production rate, but getting to full output would nearly double the pace.Lockheed delivered 66 F-35s last year, and sees production and delivery of 91 jets this year. By 2023, the company expects to reach 160 jets per year.Other defense stocks will also see a lift when F-35 output jumps. Northrop Grumman (NOC) builds the center fuselage and mission planning software, United Technologies (UTX) makes the engines, and Raytheon (RTN) is modifying its missiles and other weapons for the jet.Lockheed and Raytheon rose 0.5% in the stock market today while Northrop sank 0.55% and United Tech climbed 1.55%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAs Lockheed gears up for full-rate production and smooths out lingering development problems, separate contract issues remain.The Pentagon has stopped taking F-35 deliveries due to a dispute on payments for correcting production errors. But during Lockheed's first-quarter earnings call last month, CEO Marillyn Hewson said she expects ""resolution on this soon"" and said that the company will still meet its delivery goal of over 90 F-35s this year.In addition, contract talks for the 11th batch of low-rate production, which includes more than 130 planes, are dragging on. Lockheed and the Pentagon missed their target to have its done by the end of 2017.Lockheed ""could be much more cooperative and more collaborative, and we could seal this deal faster. We could. They choose not to, and that's a negotiating tactic,"" Vice Adm. Mat Winter, F-35 Program Executive Officer, said in February.Meanwhile, defense officials are pressuring Lockheed to find ways to lower the expected life-cycle expenses of the F-35 fleet, which will cost about $1.1 trillion to operate and maintain through 2077, Bloomberg reported in April.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsWhy Air Force Is Rushing To Fly A Sixth-Generation Fighter JetHypersonic Weapons: The Biggest Warfighting Disrupter Since Stealth Is Coming

Mattel (MAT) posted the strongest early move among Nasdaq 100 stocks — up nearly 4% after an analyst upgrade. Netflix (NFLX) surged after two analysts raised price targets ahead of the company's earnings release next week.On Tuesday, the market's powerful rally left the Dow, S&P 500 and the Nasdaq with gains in five of the past six sessions. That has led to an improving market status as the three indexes climb off a test of support at their 200-day moving averages. Markets remain volatile and quick to turn on a headline. In addition, all three benchmark indexes face an upcoming test of resistance at their 50-day moving averages. The Dow Jones ended Tuesday 1% below its 50-day line.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Trump administration on Wednesday pressed allies to support military action vs. Syria, news reports said. The effort is in response to a chemicals weapons attack reported Saturday in Syria. That attack was attributed to state forces led by the country's embattled president, Bashar al-Assad. Both the U.S. and France had by early Wednesday reportedly positioned ships armed with cruise missiles in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. A tweet from President Trump warned Russia of the pending missile attack in Syria, where the Kremlin maintains a broad military stance in support of al-Assad.Crude oil price gains continued, with West Texas Intermediate up 0.8% — to above $66 per barrel early Wednesday. On Tuesday, the crude oil price rallied nearly 4%.

Facebook stock jumped 0.8% in early trading.Early stock action showed Netflix up 1.8%, running ahead of Apple (AAPL) as well as its FANG stock peers.  Goldman Sachs hoisted the stock's price target to 360, from 315. Goldman expects Netflix to top consensus views for a 60% gain in earnings when the company reports first-quarter results Monday. The report projected that ""global scale benefits from the thriving subscriber base, distribution network and content library"" would trump some weakness in subscriber growth.Cowen & Co. jacked up Netflix target price to 325, from 275. Cowen pointed to the streaming entertainment leader's extensive slate of  fresh content. It also said the company may have received a boost from lower-than-expected network viewership of the Winter Olympics. Netflix shares are in the fifth week of a shallow consolidation.Tesla skidded 1.5% after a Goldman Sachs note lowered its price target to 195, from 205 — 36% below the stock's closing price Tuesday. The note projected the company would find itself forced to go to markets for additional capital before the end of the year. That would counter the guidance recently offered by company chief, Elon Musk. Musk tweeted for investors to ""Place your bets"" following the note's release. Goldman held its sell rating on the stock.Tesla shares ended Tuesday up 25% from an April 2 low, but still well below their 10- and 40-week levels of support.Industrial supplies distributor Fastenal opened to a 4.5% loss, after reporting a narrow miss in its first-quarter earnings.

10,MAT,"Immigration: Another day, another manufactured crisis. In this one, a ""caravan"" of 1,200 people from Central America (mainly Honduras) are making their way up through Guatemala and Mexico to the U.S. border. Once there, they plan to ""demand"" amnesty. If the U.S. fails to defend its border, all of us will regret it later.This is no cry for help, or a group of helpless refugees in dire need of humanitarian aid. It's a gang of politicized malcontents, organized by a leftist group called Pueblos Sin Fronteras, or People Without Borders in the North American vernacular. Remember the hundreds of ""unaccompanied"" Central American children that flooded our borders a while back? Same thing.Perhaps the People Without Borders leadership believe they're going to bring the entire immigration crisis to a head with this stunt. Well, they may be right, but not in the way that they think.President Trump is pushing Congress hard for tougher immigration laws, even asking Republicans in the Senate to employ the ""nuclear option"" — a filibuster-free vote — to get the job done.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBy the way, Mexico, which frequently criticizes the U.S. for its ""harsh"" immigration policies, is far harder on Latin American immigrants than the U.S. would ever dream of being. Illegal immigrants who enter Mexico are immediately apprehended, jailed and summarily sent home. Their southern border is secure.That's why it's curious to read a Reuters dispatch that notes ""Local (Mexican) officials have offered lodging in town squares and empty warehouses or arranged transport for the migrants...But the help may not be entirely altruistic. 'The authorities want us to leave their cities,' said Rodrigo Abeha, an organizer from Pueblo Sin Fronteras. 'They've been helping us, in part to speed the massive group out of their jurisdictions.' ""That certainly sounds plausible. But so does the idea that Mexico's federal government, which loathes Trump, wants to create chaos on the border to force his hand. It's really perfect, since it isn't Mexicans this time who are crossing but people from other Central American countries. Mexican officials can just shrug and say, ""It's not our fault."" But it is.Mexico isn't just mad at Trump. It's also just kicked off its once every six years presidential election. Right out of the gate, leftist former Mexico City Mayor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has an 18-point lead over his nearest rivals. The candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, sits in third place — a dismal showing for the party that literally built modern Mexico, for good or ill.""A Lopez Obrador victory could usher in a Mexican government less accommodating toward the United States, where President Donald Trump has stoked trade tensions with Mexico and aggressively moved to curb immigration,"" Reuters wrote.Is this a move by Mexico's President Enrique Peña Nieto to politically outflank Lopez Obrador by moving to his left on immigration to give the PRI candidate a boost, while also sticking a thumb, metaphorically speaking, in Donald Trump's eye?Peña Nieto is known to despise Trump, even canceling an official White House visit  in February because Trump refused to back down on his demand that Mexico pay for the border wall. Is putting out the welcome mat for the Pueblos Sin Fronteras Pena Nieto's revenge?If so, it's awfully foolish and awfully petty. He will hand the next president of Mexico, whoever he is, a deeply damaged relationship with the United States. Mexico has many problems, and needs U.S. help to solve them.Meanwhile, the Central Americans have demands, including that the U.S. ""respect our rights as refugees and our right to dignified work to be able to support our families."" And, of course, they want the U.S. to ""open the borders to us because we are as much citizens as the people of the countries where we are and/or travel.""Yes, they're that divorced from reality.Because Trump isn't about to let the Central American throng cross the border, and he'll have support from average Americans. It's possible he'll even deploy troops. Will the ""refugees"" instigate a violent confrontation? We wouldn't put it past the leftist leaders of this political caravan. The left has a rich history of sacrificing the very people it pretends to help on the altar of socialist ideals. What better way to win the immigration debate than to have a few martyrs?In the meantime, Trump tweeted out: ""DACA is dead because the Democrats didn't care or act, and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon ... No longer works. Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper border legislation. Democrats want No Borders, hence drugs and crime!"" He's right: The Democrats pretended to be all in for the ""dreamers,"" but when it came to cutting a deal with Trump, they refused.This is a reminder for all those who don't know: Nations that don't control their borders cease to exist. Their laws no longer mean anything. Democracy ceases to function.

Broadcom is shifting its headquarters to the U.S. from Singapore, but the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States cited concerns about its ties to China, including firms like Huawei. The interagency body also was worried that the U.S. would lose its leadership position in 5G wireless technology if Qualcomm was acquired by the notoriously low-R&D Broadcom. Analysts say Broadcom is likely to remain acquisitive, but will pursue smaller chip firms. A day after abandoning its pursuit of Qualcomm, Broadcom reported fiscal first-quarter sales and earnings that beat Wall Street's targets, but gave in-line revenue guidance for the current quarter amid a sharp decline in wireless chip sales.The digital media and marketing software firm earned an adjusted $1.55 a share, up 65% year over year, on sales of $2.08 billion, up 24%, in its fiscal first quarter ended March 2.

12,MAT,"ARLINGTON, Va. — Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 is on schedule to perform intense combat testing and will face the Cold War-era A-10 in a close air support face-off sometime this year.Vice Adm. Mat Winter, director of the Joint Strike Fighter program office, told reporters at a roundtable Wednesday that the F-35 will face the A-10 either as part of a close air support test scheduled to start in April or as part of its major full combat testing certification, which is on schedule to start in September and be finished by May 2019.Congress mandated the tests amid a fierce debate over the A-10's future. While warfighters cherish its ability to rain down massive firepower to support troops on the ground, the Air Force wants to retire the aging fleet to save money and meet constricted budget requirements.The F-35 was supposed to fill the close air support role left by the A-10, but critics say the stealthy fighter doesn't have the same amount of firepower or survivability in combat and instead called on the Air Force to maintain the so-called Warthog.For now, the A-10 is here to stay, as the Air Force asked for money in its 2019 budget request to replace the attack plane's wings.Lockheed shares closed down 1% at 352.44 on the stock market today.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportBack in 2015 the Pentagon's Office of Operational Test and Evaluation suggested a fly-off between the two planes, but Air Force officials called any potential test ""silly,"" saying the two planes perform different functions and the F-35's stealth capabilities allow it to enter high-threat environments.The F-35's close air support test is scheduled for April and will take place predominantly at Edwards Air Force Base in Southern California. It will follow a cold weather test completed earlier this month in Alaska.Both tests are precursors for the major Initial Operational Test and Evaluation, which the F-35 must pass before Lockheed can start full-rate production on the plane.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Why Air Force Is Rushing To Fly A Sixth-Generation Fighter JetPentagon's No. 2 Has This Confusing 'Mindset' On Lockheed's F-35Hypersonic Weapons: The Biggest Warfighting Disrupter Since Stealth Is Coming

13,MAT,"Hoping to lead the smartphone conversation for at least the next six months, Samsung took shots at rival Apple's (AAPL) iPhone X on Sunday as it unveiled its Galaxy S9 handset lineup at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.X During the introduction of the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus handsets, Samsung poked fun at the notch in the display of the iPhone X, which contains the front-facing camera and Face ID sensor, and the lack of a fingerprint reader on Apple's flagship smartphone, 9to5Mac reported.In contrast to the iPhone X, the Galaxy S9 handsets feature an uninterrupted rectangular OLED display and a fingerprint scanner for unlocking the device. The new handsets also feature improved cameras and cost less than Apple's top-of-the-line smartphone, which starts at $999. The Galaxy S9 has a 5.8-inch display, like the iPhone X, but costs $720. The Galaxy S9 Plus has a 6.2-inch display and costs $840.The Galaxy S9 models feature ""strong handset designs,"" but consumers may delay purchases because of rising flagship smartphone prices, IHS Markit analysts Gerrit Schneemann and Wayne Lam said in a report issued Sunday.""Samsung must work hard to market the benefits of these designs to counter negative pricing perception,"" they said.Apple introduced its 11th-generation smartphones, the iPhone X and iPhone 8 series, in September 2017. This fall, for its annual smartphone refresh, it is widely expected to unveil three new models: an upgraded 5.8-inch OLED handset and a 6.5-inch OLED model, as well as a 6.1-inch LCD-screen model.Until their release, Samsung will be touting the advantages of its Galaxy S9 handsets, which run Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Android 8 operating system, known as ""Oreo.""One of the big selling points of Apple's latest smartphones is their photographic capabilities. But Samsung says its handsets feature best-in-class cameras, including superior low-light imaging and super-slow-motion video capture.""Samsung is focusing on enhanced camera capabilities to differentiate from the competition and stay in the race with Apple's camera advancements,"" Schneemann and Lam wrote.Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!Samsung will begin taking preorders for the Galaxy S9 series handsets on Friday, with availability starting March 16.Apple shares were up 2% to close at 178.97 on the stock market today.In a report to clients Saturday, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple is preparing to introduce high-end, over-the-ear headphones to add to its growing audio accessory lineup, AppleInsider reported.

14,MAT,"Want to achieve a huge goal?""(Then) don't tell me your goal; don't tell me your dream; tell me your plan,"" said Jeff Haden, author of ""The Motivation Myth: How High Achievers Really Set Themselves Up to Win.""Haden says research shows that people who talk about a goal they want to achieve — especially how it will feel to achieve it — are much less likely to do so.This is because ""you already got a kick out of people thinking of you (for example) as an NYC Marathon finisher, so now you're less motivated to actually be an NYC Marathon finisher.""To improve your results on anything, consider changing your perspective.Tips:Raise the stakes. Haden says that in a recent research study, one group was given a simple temptation and told to say in response to it, ""I can't,"" while the other group was told to say, ""I don't.""Participants told to say, ""I can't"" gave in to the temptation 61% of the time, while participants told to say, ""I don't"" gave in only 36%.""When we say 'I can't,' we automatically give ourselves a way out,"" Haden said. ""We have a choice. Actually, we could give in.""But when we say 'I don't,' we're powerful. We're determined. We're not making a choice. What we do — or don't do — is based on something much stronger: our identity. We don't, because that's who we are.""Stay in the moment. Successful leaders are focused and present, says Julie Rosenberg, author ""Beyond The Mat: Achieve Focus, Presence, and Enlightened Leadership though the Principles and Practice of Yoga.""She adds these leaders ""have cultivated an ability to pay attention to what's important and avoid the constant distractions that negatively impact productivity and results. They do not dwell on past mistakes and they do not brood about future risks and concerns.""Haden says if a big goal looks like a scary mountain, just focus on the next step, ""the day to day and not the end result.""Be selective. Having to make too many decisions in a day can be counterproductive. The more choices we make during the day, Haden says, the harder each one is on our brain ""and the more we start to look for shortcuts.""""A to-do list with 20 or 30 items is really just a wish list — impossible and depressing,"" Haden said.Paring down the number of issues you tackle in a day improves your chances of making good decisions.Also, turn ambiguous goals into achievable tasks. Instead of saying, ""Make more cold calls,"" Haden says you should tell yourself to ""make three cold calls to prospects today.""Systemize complexity. A good research-and-reflection process is key to solid decision-making, says Cheryl Strauss Einhorn, author of ""Problem Solved: A Powerful System for Making Complex Decisions With Confidence and Conviction.""High-stakes decisions deserve time and attention, but ""we're in such a rush to reach a conclusion that we never really take the time for deep reflection,"" Strauss Einhorn said.One culprit: information overload. People are overprogrammed to answer emails late at night and waking to urgent texts, she says.""We struggle with the need to react when we also need to really think,"" Strauss Einhorn said. ""Yet when it comes to our future, we deserve the time needed for thoughtful reflection. Insight doesn't come from collecting information alone; it comes from brainwork.""Pause throughout the day. Turn off your cellphone, shut down your computer and give yourself a few moments of quiet, Rosenberg advises.""Your brain activity will almost instantly be less frenzied,"" she said.Schedule tranquility. Make time for it in your day to de-stress. Rosenberg suggests doing a simple meditation practice, even for just two to five minutes per day.She says simple yoga breathing techniques support the nervous system and kick-start a relaxation response. ""This reduces stress and helps our minds to become less cluttered and frantic, allowing us to make prudent and objective, rather than reactive, decisions,"" Rosenberg said.

17,MAT,"Shutdown: Republicans don't have a great track record with government shutdowns. In the past, no matter whose fault it is, the GOP gets blamed by the opposition Democrats and their allies in the mainstream media for any budget shutdown. This time will be no different.X The GOP is once again engaged in a game of chicken with the Democrats over the budget. They have until Friday to either extend their budget deadline, or to solve an impasse over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, also known as the ""Dreamers"" bill. If not, Democrats have threatened to shut down the government.What's obvious is that a shutdown looms not because of Republican intransigence or ""obstruction,"" but because Democrats know they can always pin the blame on their opponents.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveRecent events show this is true.Acting with goodwill, President Trump met last week with both sides in an effort to bring about a deal on immigration and the budget. Unfortunately, in disputed remarks leaked by Democrat Dick Durbin, Trump  supposedly used vulgar language in saying that recent immigrants from Haiti and Africa come from ""sh*tholes."" Never mind that Durbin's comments have been disputed. It's led to a media fusillade of scorn, derision and hate toward Trump, regardless of the charge's verity.Durbin's deeply cynical move of leaking Trump's alleged remarks made in private was clearly meant to sabotage budget talks and lead to a shutdown. But it also gives Democrats room to refuse to make a deal or compromise, shut down the government, and still claim the high moral road. Or so they think.In the case of DACA, President Trump worked hard to craft a bipartisan deal that would give both sides something they wanted. He came up empty.The outlines of a possible deal were clear: Trump has promised to build a wall on the border, and wants it funded in a new budget; he wants more security on the border; he wants to end chain migration and the foolish immigration ""lottery"" the U.S. holds every year to bring in 50,000 people from around the world.And what do the Democrats want? Basically, a floodtide of immigration, including making millions of the so-called ""dreamers"" — young illegal immigrants who have been here since infancy or childhood — legal.Why? A recent memo written by Democratic Party activist Jennifer Palmieri, obtained by the Daily Caller, explains: ""The fight to protect Dreamers is not only a moral imperative,"" Palmieri wrote, ""it is also a critical component of the Democratic Party's future success."" (Emphasis ours).In other words, once again they're cynically using immigration to create a massive bloc of reliable Democratic voters, and counting on the GOP to go along with it to avoid being called racist haters.It's not much of a gamble — it's worked before. The GOP has a history of caving on these confrontations.And in going after this illegal immigrant demographic, the Democrats know what they're doing.""A 2012 study of 2,900 foreign born naturalized immigrants found that 62% identified as Democrats and 25% as Republicans. That's a 2.5-fold difference favoring Democrats,"" Brian C. Joondeph, writing in the American Thinker, notes. Meanwhile, ""A Pew Research Center study from the same year found that undocumented Latino immigrants identified 31% Democrat and 4% Republican, an eight-fold difference.""Now you see why Democrats will go to the mat over this. It's about votes and political power, not compassion.Sure, a deal would be simple: Dems give in on the wall, security and limits on future immigration, and the GOP agrees to legalize some of the dreamers. And, presto, you have a deal. Trump would sign it, even though it would anger many of his strongest supporters.But, after recent wins in red-district, off-year elections, Democrats are confident they can engineer a ""blue wave"" in 2018, and retake the House and possibly even the Senate. As such, DACA remains a potent campaign issue, one they can use to portray Republicans as heartless, xenophobic haters, and Democrats as welcoming champions of immigrants and children.This is nothing new. Ever since Teddy Kennedy's Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965, Democrats have gamed the immigration system to let in millions of future new Democrats, many of them illegal, and to keep out immigrants that might align with the GOP. All in the name of ""compassion,"" of course.That's why, in crafting their final budget proposal for Friday, Republicans need to make it as painful as possible for the Democrats to demogogue the issue of immigration and to shut down the government. If not, it will be used ruthlessly as a bludgeon against them in the 2018 midterm elections.They also need to get the message out: Minority unemployment is at a record low as the Trump boom unfolds. Hispanics, Asians and African Americans are doing better under Trump than under any slick-talking Democratic president ever. The idea that Trump is some kind of uber-racist is absurd. Those who want the law, not politics, to govern our immigration policies need to repeat this.In the meantime, it must also be made clear that the Democratic Party will be to blame if the government shuts down — not the Republicans. The GOP made a good-faith effort to compromise, and were rebuffed by the Democrats, in one of the more cynical exercises in racial and ethnic policies in recent years. If the government shuts down, make them pay.RELATED:Trump's Grand Immigration Bargain: Either Take Border Security Seriously, Or No Deal On 'Dreamers' Can Trump Win His Fight Against Leftist Judges And Open-Border Radicals Over Immigration? Trump's New 'Principled Realism': Economics = Security  Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

18,MAT,"The Nasdaq ran ahead of the major market averages Friday, up 1.2% as rising optimism regarding a GOP tax reform effort helped drive blue chip tech names including Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT) and United Technologies (UTX) to the head of the Nasdaq 100.X Electronics makers and staffing companies, metals and drug distributors were among the many industries to post gains of better than 3% during the session.The advance was sufficient to lift the Nasdaq past its Nov. 28 peak to its first new high in three weeks. The S&P 500 gained  0.9%, also scratching off a new high as Under Armour (UA) took the index's largest gain, surging 9% after Stifel Nicolaus upgraded the stock to buy, from hold.That put Under Armour shares back above their 10-week moving average and up 32% from a November low, although still deep in a 20-month correction.Railroad CSX (CSX), Barbie-maker Mattel (MAT) and chipmaker Oracle (ORCL) turned in the S&P 500's worst losses, down 8%, 5% and 4%, respectively.The Dow ran not quite as hot as its peer indexes, up 0.6%, but plenty strong enough to once again make news highs. Intel was the leader, up 3% on what appeared to be primarily a tax plan-related move.Small caps also did well with the Russell 2000 up 1.5%.Intel's gain put shares in a buy range on a rebound from support at the stock's 10-week moving average. The rebound occurred in only modest volume, and the chart pattern is also a flat base, so investors have the option of waiting to see whether shares climb past the 47.40 buy point.Microsoft took out its 86.30 buy point, rising nearly 3%  in powerful trade, moving to a new high but remaining well within buy range.Bitcoin drew heavy attention, with the cryptocurrency jumping 10% — back above $17,800. Related stocks were also busy, with Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) up 14%, bringing its gain since the start of the month to 79%. Riot Blockchain (RIOT) also vaulted 14%. Marathon Patent Group (MARA) thumped out a 6% gain and bitcoin friendly online retailer Overstock.com (OSTK) soared 11%.Nearly one-third IBD 50 names scored gains of 2% or better. At the top of the list, Planet Fitness (PLNT), SVB Financial Group (SVB) and Atlassian (TEAM) all sparked up more than 3%. Planet Fitness and SVB are extended.

21,MAT,"November has been a month of merger talk. Chipmaker Marvell Technology (MRVL) agreed to buy rival Cavium (CAVM) Monday for roughly $6 billion. Broadcom (AVGO) has tried to acquire fellow wireless chip giant Qualcomm (QCOM) for $130 billion, which would make it the largest tech takeover ever. Hasbro (HAS) has bid for rival toy maker Mattel (MAT). The media and telecom industries are basically in a speed-dating frenzy, with 21st Century Fox (FOXA) reportedly attracting many suitors for key assets.XWhy now? No one unifying catalyst appears to be behind the chatter or loosening the taps to facilitate the flow of deals. And M&A is on track to reach its lowest point in seven years.Still, while every company and industry has its own problems, cash, broadly, has not been not one of them.Companies across the S&P 500 Industrials — S&P 500 index members excluding financial, utilities and transportation companies — were sitting on a record $1.5 trillion in cash or cash equivalents in the second quarter. That cash hoard likely hit another all-time high in the third quarter, said Howard Silverblatt, a senior analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.""All the tools are there for M&A. The tools are there, the ability is there, the economy continues on,"" he said, adding: ""And every company has a list of other ones that they want to buy.""A mountain of cash also makes a company more attractive to investor holding groups, he said.But as GOP tax reform makes its way through Congress, nothing in the legislation pointed directly to a more M&A-friendly environment, he said. Despite the reports of corporate courtship, the numbers also don't exactly show any dramatic uptick in merger activity from years and quarters past.The tally of announced deals in the U.S. this year is on track to be at around 16,000. That would be the lowest since 2010, Richard Peterson, a principal analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence, notes.Peterson said that buyers might be worried about stretched valuations. He added that foreign purchases of U.S. businesses have slowed, and that souring sentiment on weaker industries like retail and automobiles could be making big private-equity deals look less attractive.""With robust deal activity in recent years, buyers may be may finding it's taking longer to assimilate acquisitions into operations,"" he added.So far this year, some $1.2 trillion in deals have been announced, potentially down from around $1.65 trillion last year and nearly $2 trillion in 2015, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. The total value of deals announced so far this quarter was at $287.5 billion, well below the roughly $521 billion announced during the quarter a year ago. Deals announced in the third quarter of this year amounted to $322.5 billion.And amid an economic recovery that, for many over recent years, has still like a recession, big companies have tried to snap up smaller ones because there have been fewer avenues to grow sales to Wall Street's liking.Consider the striking contrast between deals struck before the financial crisis and after. Since 2010, companies announced more than 140,000 deals, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data. From 2000 to 2007, in the run-up to the financial crisis, there were around 77,000.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Some of the merger talks have also come in industries that have faced technological upheaval in recent years.Comcast (CMCSA), Disney (DIS) and Verizon (VZ), have set their sights on 21st Century Fox in one way or another, while AT&T has struggled to win approval for its planned acquisition of Time Warner (TWX). The FCC has voted to ease rules surrounding media ownership, potentially making future tie-ups easier. But the cable industry is also dealing with cord-cutting. Questions remain about whether Disney can throw enough ""Star Wars"" movies and streaming content at analysts to keep them from fretting over ESPN.Meanwhile, Marvell's chip business has struggled. Apple (AAPL) may or may not keep putting Qualcomm chips in its iPhones, and the two companies have been tangled up in a patent dispute. Meanwhile, Hasbro snagged Mattel's license for Disney (DIS) toys last year, while Mattel suspended its dividend in October.At least if more companies decide to continue to get together, the cash will be there.""It all makes the stakes higher,"" Silverblatt said. ""If everybody has money, that means more people can get into the game.""Marvell jumped 6.4% in the stock market today, while Cavium leapt 10.8%.

22,MAT,"Stocks scraped out a mixed start Friday, a trainload of influential companies reported a mix of third-quarter results.XThe tech sector rallied to an early lead, with the Nasdaq Composite jumping 1.1% on positive earnings news from Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL).The Dow Jones industrial average limped out of the starting gate, down 0.1% as Dow names Microsoft and Intel (INTC) rallied, but Merck (MRK) and Chevron (CVX) fell 3% apiece.The S&P 500 swung up 0.4%, boosted by techs, as well as First Solar (FSLR) and Tenet Healthcare (THC). The gauge also moved higher despite a 19% dive by Expedia (EXPE) and a 15% decline from Mattel (MAT) on their Q3 results.There was no shortage of dramatic moves in Friday's premarket session. Among the FANG stock names, Amazon opened 9% higher after stomping third-quarter expectations on both its revenue and earnings lines. THe move lifted shares to within 3% of a flat base buy point at 1,083.41.Google parent Alphabet shot ahead 5%, after reporting its earnings were up 32% on a 24% revenue gain, well above analyst expectations, and the growth of traffic acquisition costs slowed to 23%, from 28% in the prior quarter.  The gain put shares back in a buy range above a flat base buy point of 1,006.29.The reports also mustered early strength in Apple (AAPL), which rose 1%, while Facebook (FB) gained nearly 3%.IBD 50 stock Align Technologies (ALGN) spiked 12% in premarket trade. The maker of Invisalign clear braces reported big beats on both its sales and earnings lines, with per-share earnings up 60% on a 38% revenue gain. Shares are extended after an August rebound from 10-week support.First Solar flashed 19% higher after a very big third-quarter earnings and revenue beat, and after boosting full-year earnings guidance to well above consensus views. The gain drove shares beyond buy range above a 53.10 buy point in a flat base.On the downside, retailer J.C.

23,MAT,"With quarterly results taking a turn for the worse, Mattel (MAT) Chief Executive Officer Margo Georgiadis is going to speed up the toymaker's turnaround by tripling cost cuts and suspending its dividend.Georgiadis, who joined the company in February, plans to reduce expenses by $650 million over the next two years — up from a $200 million projection in June. The company won't offer a dividend payment for the fourth quarter, which will also free up $50 million. The payout to shareholders had already been slashed by about 60% earlier this year.The extra cash will come in handy after sales declined 13% to $1.56 billion last quarter. Analysts projected revenue of $1.8 billion. North America was especially hard hit, with sales there falling 22%. Half of that decline came from the disruption caused by the bankruptcy of Toys R Us in September, Georgiadis said.""We're completely reinventing Mattel and making the tough decisions necessary to jump-start growth and profitability,"" Georgiadis said in an interview. ""2017, in my view, is a reset year for Mattel. We will start to see the benefits of the transformation into 2018.""Profit was 9 cents, excluding some items, trailing a forecast of 57 cents by analysts. The company had a net loss of $1.75 a share, including a charge of $561.9 million from a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. Meanwhile, revenue overseas rose 1.4% to $675.2 million.""We definitely had a tough quarter and we are working our way through it,"" Georgiadis said.The revenue declines were widespread, with Barbie falling 6% and Hot Wheels 4%. Fisher-Price dropped 15%, and American Girl tumbled 30%.After a temporary halt in trading, Mattel shares plunged as much as 28% to $11.10. The stock declined 44% this year through Thursday's close.The company's turnaround has stretched out over three years as the loss of the main Disney Princess and Frozen licenses — coupled with the decline of once strong brands like Monster High — have bludgeoned the stock's value. The world's largest toy maker brought in Georgiadis, a former Google executive, to accelerate the company's plans. She has so far revamped the management team, including a new chief financial officer — Joe Euteneuer, who joined from Sprint Communications.Georgiadis has said Mattel's products need to adapt to the way kids are now being raised, citing toddlers on iPads and education-obsessed parents. This will lead to a big push in digital content, internet-connected toys and products that promote learning, she said. She also wants to expand into gaming, live experiences and other categories of products.The cost-cutting is focused on simplifying the company — Mattel will reduce the number of products it makes by 40%, Georgiadis said. When Mattel lost Disney (DIS), it tried to fill the revenue hole of about $500 million by launching new brands. Many of them didn't pan out, and will be discontinued. That will allow it to spend more on building its core brands like Barbie, Hot Wheels, American Girl and Fisher-Price, she said.Georgiadis reiterated that the long-term goal is to still reach mid- to high-single-digit sales growth and an operating profit margin of 15%.""Now we'll have the resources we need to free up to invest,"" Georgiadis said. ""I'm excited about the progress we're making, despite some of the challenges in the quarter.""

24,MAT,"Nasdaq 100 futures soared Friday morning after a wave of big earnings late Thursday. Megacap techs Amazon.com (AMZN), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) are all up sharply, with the two FANG stocks signaling likely buying opportunities. Chip plays Intel (INTC) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) also advanced. But Baidu (BIDU) was among several losers.XNasdaq 100 futures surged 1.35% above fair value. S&P 500 index futures rose 0.4% vs. fair value while Dow futures were up nearly 0.3%.During Thursday's stock market trading, the S&P 500 rose 0.1% and the Dow 0.3%, while the Nasdaq composite retreated 0.1%.Amazon earned 52 cents a share a share, obliterating views for just 1 cent. Revenue grew 34% to $43.7 billion, beating the consensus for $42 billion. Amazon Web Services revenue leapt 42% to $4.58 billion in Q3. AWS had operating profit of $1.171 billion vs. the companywide $347 million.Amazon shot up 7.4% to 1,044 in early trading. That suggests a high-volume rebound from its 50-day moving average, which would offer a buying opportunity. However, the stock could find resistance below its old high of 1,083.31. Amazon is in a late-stage flat base with a potential entry of 1,083.41.  Keep in mind that overnight action doesn't always translate into how a stock will open or close the following session.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. If you owned Amazon, you're happy now, but Baidu holders seem headed for a big retreat. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Adjusted earnings climbed 32% from a year ago, with revenue jumping 24% to $27.77 billion. Both cleared earnings views.Google doesn't break out its cloud computing revenue, grouping it in ""other revenues,"" which rose 40% to $3.405 billion. Google executives touted cloud growth on its post-Q3 call. Google reached a deal with Cisco Systems (CSCO) this week to market its cloud-computing services to the enterprise market as it takes on Amazon Web Services and Microsoft's Azure.Alphabet shares rose 3.2% to 1,023.59 early Friday. That suggests the stock will retake a 1006.29 buy point briefly cleared earlier this month.Google gets most of its money from online advertising. So its gains there bode well for Facebook (FB), which will report earnings in early November. Facebook shares rose 1.7% to 173.49 in the premarket, trying to get back above a 175.59 entry.Microsoft earnings rose 17% to 84 cents a share, defying views for a dip to 72 cents. Revenue grew 12% to $24.54 billion. Microsoft said its Azure cloud-computing revenue shot up 90%, though it didn't give an actual dollar figure. The Intelligent Cloud division, which includes Azure and Windows Server, saw a 14% gain to $6.9 billion.""This quarter we exceeded $20 billion in commercial cloud (annualized revenue run rate), outpacing the goal we set just over two years ago,"" Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella said in a  statement.Microsoft rose 4.6% to 82.38 early. The Dow tech titan's stock was already modestly extended from a breakout.Baidu appeared to deliver earnings that crushed third-quarter estimates. But the Chinese search giant, which is becoming a big leader in artificial intelligence, gave weak Q4 guidance. Baidu shares fell 8.8% to 237.65 in the premarket, signaling a move below its 50-day moving average. Baidu hasn't had a very long run and it's unclear how heavy the weekly volume will be, so this may not trigger a clear long-term sell signal.(During Thursday's session, Chinese for-profit education stocks Tal Education (TAL) and New Oriental Education (EDU) did trip long-term sell signals, including high-volume sell-offs through their 10-week lines.)In addition to Baidu, Mattel (MAT) and Expedia (EXPE) were huge overnight losers while Cerner (CERN) and Fortinet (FTNT) also sold off following their quarterly reports.RELATED:Google Shoots To All-Time High After Beating Earnings ViewsAmazon Blows Past Earnings Views, Beats On Sales; Shares SoarMicrosoft Tops September-Quarter Sales, Earnings TargetsBaidu Dives On Weak Revenue Forecast

25,MAT,"Stocks deflated into a weak close Monday, despite an early boost from global markets, as earnings season headed into its first week of full-on reporting.XThe Nasdaq saw selling pick up sharply toward the end of the session, ending down 0.6%. The action in small caps was weaker yet, leaving the Russell 2000 with a 0.8% loss. The S&P 500 slid 0.4%, while the Dow Jones industrial average held to a 0.2% decline.Volume was lower on the NYSE and higher on the Nasdaq, according to preliminary figures.In Japan, stocks in Tokyo had surged at Monday's U.S. open, after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's Liberal Democratic Party locked up a solid majority in parliament during elections there Sunday. Europe's leading benchmarks posted uneven gains, despite insistence by leaders of Spain's Catalonia region that they will deny attempts by the federal government to assert national control in the region this week.Among U.S. stocks, the heating and air conditioning group posted the day's strongest gain among industries, listed by Lennox International's (LII) 7% gain in heavy trade following its third-quarter results.  The move tripped a breakout past a 185.33 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.Toymakers posted the worst loss among industry groups during Monday's session, hurt by Hasbro's (HAS) 9% post-earnings sell off, which spilled over to Mattel (MAT), triggering a 3% decline — the largest drop among Nasdaq 100 companies.Seagate Technology (STX) was the rock star on the Nasdaq 100, easily topping the index with a 13% gap up gain. Third-quarter revenue and earnings declined less than expected by analysts, and Chief Executive Dave Mosley said the company had entered a long-term supply agreement with Toshiba's memory-chip business.The stock ended the session 29% above an August low, and set to test possible resistance at the stock's 40-week moving average.Four Dow stocks took gains of better than 1%. Wal-Mart (WMT) led, up 1.4% to end 8% above an 82.09 buy point in a flat base.General Electric (GE) took the Dow's hardest hit, down more than 6% after a pair of analyst downgrades worsened the company's transitional turmoil.On the IBD 50, Argentine bank Grupo Servielle (SUPV) led, climbing almost 6% in light trade.  The stock was already extended, and ended the session 46% above an 18.54 buy point from a mid-August breakout.China's TAL Education (TAL) posted the largest loss among IBD 50 stocks, down 4% as the stock continued its pullback from its Oct. 16 high.

26,MAT,"Toys ""R"" Us Inc., the once-dominant specialty retailer and ultimate toyland for a generation of post-war baby boomers, filed for bankruptcy thanks to a crushing debt load from a previous buyout and relentless competition from warehouse and online retailers.XThe bankruptcy filing is the latest blow to a brick-and-mortar retail industry reeling from store closures, sluggish mall traffic and the gravitational pull of Amazon.com (AMZN), which has revolutionized the way people consume with affordable online offerings and global home delivery service.A dozen-plus major retailers have filed for creditor protection this year, including Payless Inc., Gymboree Corp. and Perfumania Holdings Inc., all of which are using the Chapter 11 process to close underperforming stores and expand online operations.The shakeout is also reverberating across American malls and shopping districts. More than 10% of U.S. retail space, or nearly 1 billion square feet, may need to be closed, converted to other uses or renegotiated for lower rent in coming years, according to data provided to Bloomberg by CoStar Group.The troubles at Toys ""R"" Us come as retailers and suppliers ramp up for the all-important holiday shopping season. In an emailed statement, Mattel (MAT) said, ""As one of our most important retail partners, we are committed to supporting Toys 'R' Us and its management team as they work through this process, particularly as we approach the holiday season.""The bankruptcy filing by the company also may have global implications, especially for Chinese toy manufacturers. Some 38% of the company's revenue came from overseas markets in the latest fiscal year. ""It's a loss for the long-term benefit of the entire industry,"" said Lun Leung, chairman of Hong Kong-based Lung Cheong Group, a toy supplier for Hasbro (HAS). He said Toys ""R"" Us accounted for less than 5 percent of the group's sales.The company listed debt and assets of more than $1 billion each in Chapter 11 documents submitted Monday at the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Richmond, Virginia. Prior to filing, the chain secured more than $3 billion in financing from lenders including a JPMorgan Chase & Co.-led bank syndicate and certain existing lenders to fund operations while it restructures, according to a company statement. The funding is subject to court approval.The company didn't announce plans to close stores, and said its locations across the globe would continue normal operations.""Like any retailer, decisions about any future store closings – and openings – will continue to be made based on what makes the best sense for the business,"" Michael Freitag, a spokesman for Toys ""R"" Us, said in an email.Much of the toy merchant's debt is the legacy of a $7.5 billion leveraged buyout in 2005 in which Bain Capital, KKR & Co. and Vornado Realty Trust loaded the company with debt to take it private. Since then, the Wayne, New Jersey-based chain has struggled to dig itself out.Chief Executive Officer David Brandon took over Toys ""R"" Us in 2015 and sought to make shopping there a more enjoyable experience. Last year, he set out a vision of kids ""dragging their parents to our stores because they want to see what's going on.""The retailer introduced the ""Hot Toy Finder,"" which tells customers exactly where in their local store to find the items featured on its "" Holiday Hot Toy List."" The chain, which has provided the annual list of the 50 hottest toys for 20 years, also offered price matching and free layaway.While Brandon made some progress reducing liabilities, he ultimately was unable to resuscitate the closely held chain's fortunes. The company reported a net loss of $164 million in the quarter ended April 29, compared to $126 million for the same period in the prior year. It hasn't shown an annual profit since 2013.""Together with our investors, our objective is to work with our debtholders and other creditors to restructure the $5 billion of long-term debt on our balance sheet,"" Brandon said in the company statement.When reports surfaced recently that Toys ""R"" Us was weighing a bankruptcy filing, Chinese toy scooter maker Pinghu Mijia Child Product Co. put all of the retailer's orders on hold, fearing it wouldn't get paid, according to sales manager Justin Yu. The toy retailer represents about 10 to 20 percent of the Chinese supplier's sales.""We were shocked to hear the news last week because their orders to us have been rising every year, so we did not know they were in trouble,"" Yu said. ""They're a major buyer and I would say that the majority of toy makers in China would have some contracts with them.""Li Jiewei, a spokesman with the China Toy and Juvenile Products Association, thinks demand for toys remains robust, regardless of the problems at Toys ""R"" Us. ""Total toy exports from China have been growing every year and growth remains strong so we don't see it as an industry problem,"" he said.Charles Lazarus opened Children's Bargain Town, a baby-furniture store, in Washington in 1948, according to the Toys ""R"" Us website. He added toys two years later and opened the first Toys ""R"" Us, modeled after self-service supermarkets, in 1957. Lazarus stepped down as chairman and CEO in 1994. Two years later, the first Babies ""R"" Us opened.The company sells toy and baby merchandise in about 1,600 Toys ""R"" Us and Babies ""R"" Us locations worldwide and through websites including Toysrus.com and Babiesrus.com.The company's Canadian unit intends to seek protection in parallel proceedings in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, according to the statement. The company's operations outside of the U.S. and Canada, including its about 255 licensed stores and joint-venture partnership with a retail unit of Hong Kong-based Fung Group, are not part of the Chapter 11 filing. In Australia, Toys ""R"" Us plans to add another five stores to its existing 39 there by Christmas, said Jessica Donovan, national marketing manager for the chain in the country.Some loyal customers were disappointed by the bankruptcy news. ""This is a great pity for all families with kids,"" said Alex Ng, father of a three-year-old girl, at a Toys ""R"" Us outlet in Hong Kong. ""Nowhere else can compare with its product variety and, most importantly, it provides a guarantee of product quality.""

31,MAT,"What's the biggest killer in hospitals? Secrecy. That's the bottom line from the Government Accountability Office and the Food and Drug Administration.Both report that hospitals are failing to disclose when medical devices injure or kill patients by spreading cancer cells throughout their body or infecting them with superbugs. Federal regulation requires hospitals and doctors to notify the FDA of these ""adverse events"" immediately, but the regulation is ignored. ""There is limited to no reporting"" at some hospitals, says an FDA official. When hospitals stay mum, future patients become the victims.Women with uterine fibroids, for example. More than 70% of women over 50 suffer from them. Until recently, as many as 50,000 women a year were treated with a surgical device called a morcellator, even though hospitals already knew or had reason to suspect using the device might spread cancer in women with undetected tumors.The FDA must approve new medical devices before they are sold in the U.S. But regulators are unable to identify some risks before a device is in wide use. The Trump administration wants the FDA to expedite drug and device approvals — welcome news for patients with currently untreatable conditions. But expediting approval makes it all the more urgent that physicians and hospitals immediately disclose injuries, as regulations require. The burden is on the medical community to be vigilant and forthcoming.Earlier reports might have spared Amy Reed, a mother of six, from her constant battle with stage 4 cancer. When she was treated for fibroids in 2013, a morcellator — a long tube with a spinning blade on the end to shred fibroids — disturbed and spread the cancer she didn't know she had.Before Reed's case, the FDA hadn't received reports linking morcellators to cancer, although evidence now suggests there were many earlier incidents. Reed and her husband, both physicians, are driving a national campaign to warn women. The FDA says that hospitals' failure to report adverse events, like Reed's, is the weak link in patient safety.Now the FDA advises women to be counseled about risks from morcellators and tested for cancer before being treated with the device.New research also suggests possible infection risks from another commonly used device: scopes used for colonoscopies (examining the colon) and endoscopies (examining the digestive tract) are usually contaminated with bacteria. And this is not just once in a blue moon. It's most of the time, despite rigorous disinfection, according to the American Journal of Infection Control.These reusable scopes get nicks and scratches and a buildup of biofilm inside. That's a welcome mat for germs.Similarly, a 2015 Mayo Clinic study concluded scopes are usually contaminated. Neither study tracked whether patients developed infections.Another less common device, a duodenoscope, is responsible for infection outbreaks and deaths at numerous hospitals. The scope is threaded down the throat to diagnose and treat digestive problems. A design flaw allows superbugs to cling inside and survive disinfection. These scopes infected dozens of patients in Chicago and Seattle with a deadly superbug beginning in 2012.Even worse, because the medical community was not alerted, patients at other hospitals were doomed to lose their lives. Doctors at UCLA Medical Center, unaware of the earlier deaths, started using the device, leading to two more fatalities.In the past, patient advocates have complained that the FDA is too slow to approve new drugs and devices. Patients died because a treatment that could have prolonged their life wasn't approved. So the Trump administration push for cutting bureaucratic barriers is encouraging. On the other hand, medical breakthroughs by definition involve unanticipated problems. That risk can be reduced if hospitals and doctors rapidly report injuries that occur after a device is put into use. To protect lives, patient advocates need to double down on their message to the medical community: Stop the secrecy. It's a killer.RELATED:Politics, Commentary and OpinionTrump News & Tweets

36,MAT,"Nina Agabian, a retired director of research in global health science at the University of California, bought a 29th-floor apartment in San Francisco's Millennium Tower in 2010. ""It was supposed to be a wonderful building,"" she said in January, sitting in a leather chair in the building's vast, low-lit, owner's-club level. ""For many of us, who left our business lives to start our older years, this had become a nice, comfortable place.""The building, which opened in 2008 and was touted as the most luxurious tower in San Francisco, became a beacon of the city's burgeoning wealth, attracting tech millionaires, venture capitalists, and even the San Francisco 49ers retired quarterback Joe Montana.The 58-story tower's shine faded on May 10, 2016, when Agabian attended a homeowners association meeting and was informed that the building had sunk 16 inches into the earth and tilted over 15 inches at its tip and 2 inches at the base, according to suits filed by residents and the city of San Francisco. ""You can imagine how distressed we were to know that, for one, our lifetime investment and savings are at risk,"" she said. ""And we have no idea whether or not there's a fix to it, and if there is a fix to it, what it will entail.""The building, meanwhile, continues to sink.As Agabian and more than 20 other residents file multiple lawsuits against the building's developer, the city of San Francisco, and the Transbay Joint Powers Authority, another, potentially more ominous development has emerged. Two people with knowledge of Millennium Partners' liability policy say the developer is insured to cover some $100 million in damages caused by settlement or construction defects; the policy is split among several insurers. Ancillary policies held by the building's architect, structural engineer, and general contractor are worth another $50 million to $100 million, according to one of the people. Any legal fees incurred by the policyholders could be deducted from their policies. But according to experts, fixing whatever is causing the building to tilt could cost far more than that amount.Further adding to residents' woes is that it's not even clear if coverage will be available under the liability policy: It might have been voided by the flaws in the building.""I don't foresee a scenario where anyone writes a check under any policy,"" said Sarah Sherman, the U.S. property practice leader at JLT Specialty USA, an insurance broker in San Francisco. ""There's no way to avoid litigation at this point.""It's possible, in other words, that homeowners already under water on their damaged real estate investments may have to cover millions in costs to repair the building. And that's not even the extreme worst-case scenario — in 1989, some buildings on loose San Francisco soil collapsed during an earthquake. The city has asked Millennium Partners for information on how much the building can further settle without compromising the building's stability and how it will perform during a quake. In a letter dated Jan. 13, MP declined to supply the city with that data, citing ongoing litigation and mediation.""I don't want to be in a situation in two years where we look back and think we really could have done something to prevent a terrible situation,"" warned San Francisco Superior Court Judge Curtis Karnow at a Jan. 13 hearing. ""If such a terrible situation occurs, there is little clarity as to who would pay for the damage.""""Let's say there's an earthquake and there's major damage, the insurer will fight like hell not to pay the claim,"" Sherman said. ""I would not be pleased if I was in that building.""Surrounding the building is the $1.1 billion new Salesforce Tower, the new condominium tower 181 Fremont, and a neighborhood bar.While the best method of fixing the building's tilt won't be known until an engineering firm hired by the developer completes its investigation — and perhaps not even then — the cost is certain to be millions, and perhaps hundreds of millions, of dollars.Conservatively, ""I think it's fair to say that you're at least in the tens of millions of dollars,"" said Joe Maffei, who noted that his San-Francisco-based structural engineering firm is not associated with project. Stopping the settling would be very expensive, he explained, and then you have the added expense of actually evening out the building's base. A recent study released by the city which examined the fire safety, disability access, plumbing and electricity, declared the building ""remain(s) safe for occupancy at this time.""Beyond their lawsuits, the residents can't hope for recourse from the developer.""Millennium Partners doesn't own the building,"" said P.J. Johnston, a spokesman for the developer. ""Even if there was an immediate and agreed upon measure to take, the building is owned by homeowners. Millennium Partners cannot just move forward with any set of measures"" to fix the building, he said.Since the mid-19th century, the city of San Francisco has expanded its shoreline by dumping debris into its coastal marshlands and transferring sand and clay from the ocean bed onto land. Much of downtown San Francisco, including parts of Mission Street, where Millennium Tower was built, is constructed on this loose, wet soil. But the city's proximity to two major faults — the San Andreas and the Hayward — could render that same ground unstable in an earthquake, said Keith Knudsen, the deputy director of the U.S. Geological Survey's Earthquake Science Center. ""The soft material tends to amplify the parts of the shaking — the earthquake's wavelengths — which are damaging to buildings,"" he said.The engineers who designed Millennium Tower were aware that the building sat on unstable soil and constructed the 645-foot tower's base so it would behave ""dynamically"" in the event of an earthquake, at least partially withstanding the shocks on the unstable ground. To achieve this effect, they chose a support known as ""friction piles,"" a series of rods bored into the ground that would help stabilize the building as the earth rocked. While other buildings in the area were built with similar foundations (and still others use pilings drilled all the way down to firmer bedrock), the majority of the skyscrapers in downtown San Francisco are built with steel frames. Millennium Tower, in contrast, is made of vastly heavier concrete.A decade after the first piles were drilled, walls in the underground parking garage have begun to crack due to the shifting, marble floors in the lobby have begun to buckle, and residents have complained that the ventilation units have begun to fail, raising questions about when the tilt will stop, or if it will stop at all.Sales for Millennium Tower started around November 2007. By 2013 the building was fully sold for a reported total of $750 million; an April 5, 2013, article in the San Francisco Business Times, which Millennium Partners posted on its website, quoted the building's costs at $600 million.In the same story, Richard Baumert, a partner at the company, sounded a triumphant note. ""We saw it through and in the end our plan and vision for the project were validated,"" he said. The building's appeal, he continued, was ""not as much about the physical structure as the residential experience.""The article also quoted Gregg Lynn, a broker at Sotheby's International Realty who reportedly represented about a dozen Millennium Tower buyers. ""The situation we are facing is that everybody wants to buy into that building, and they are kicking themselves that they didn't when they had the chance,"" he said. ""People who sell now are expecting to cash out with major profits."" The golden era for the Millennium Tower would last less than three years.No one is quite sure why the building began to sink and tilt. It could be a flaw in the structure, which would make it Millennium Partners' responsibility, according to the building residents, or the result of the nearby construction of a major transit station, which would make it at least partially the responsibility of the station's builder. Possibly, it could be some combination of the two.A class-action by 20 building residents, led by their fellow resident, patent litigator Jerry Dodson, alleges that Millennium Partners knew the building had sunk 8.3 inches into the ground by 2009, the year after it was completed.""There's the possibility that when they poured in 2006-07, that it immediately sank,"" Dodson said in an interview in his living room in the tower, which is filled with art-deco vases and sculptures and overlooks San Francisco Bay. ""It's extremely unlikely in my mind that as we began 2009 that it immediately tilted 6 inches to the northwest. What's more likely is they poured the oil.""Millennium Partners denies responsibility for the tilting. ""At the time of its completion in 2008 and throughout its entire sales process, (the tower) had settled within predicted, safe ranges,"" said Johnston, the developer's spokesman.Dodson's 20 homeowners, who collectively paid some $75 million for their condos, claim that the developer hid the building's faulty structure from prospective buyers and that the city's administrators joined in the alleged fraud by helping conceal the tower's engineering flaws as early as February 2009 by signing mutual nondisclosure agreements. The two colluded over half a decade to keep Millennium Tower's design defects secret to allow the city to move forward on its own construction in the neighborhood, according to Dodson's complaint. The city and Millennium Tower deny these allegationsAnother target of Dodson's suit is the Transbay Joint Powers Authority (TJPA), which is building what it calls a ""Grand Central Station of the West"" next door to Millennium Tower. Part of the development, which also includes towers and below-ground rail tunnels in the soft soil, could have undermined Millennium Tower's foundation, causing the building to tilt, according to Dodson's complaint. If TJPA is found to be at fault, San Francisco taxpayers could be obliged to fund the tower's repair. The developer blames TJPA for the tilt. The TJPA has denied the allegations.The TJPA attempted to dismiss one lawsuit Millennium Tower residents filed by claiming that the tower was still structurally secure. In a move critics attributed to the city's desire to absolve itself of any blame surrounding the project, the San Francisco Attorney's office subsequently sued Millennium Partners on behalf of TJPA.Regardless of who is legally responsible, all parties have finally agreed that there is, in fact, a problem.A report commissioned by Millennium Partners and published in 2014 by the engineering firm Simpson Gumpertz & Heger determined that the building's support columns and foundation were experiencing ""significant stress."" Nevertheless, the report concluded: ""With the exception of the foundation,"" it read, ""none of the settlement-related demands on these elements are at levels that indicate impending failure."" The building's supports might be cracking, in other words, but — as of a few years ago, at least — it was unlikely to collapse.Recently, Millennium Partners entered private mediation with building residents, with the goal of halting environmental damage and to ""stop any undue further settlement of the building,"" according to the developer's spokesman. As far as Millennium Partners is concerned, the culprit is the TJPA project next door. ""We need to ensure that the damage being caused by our immediate neighbors, TJPA, is stopped,"" he added.The Oakland firm Sage Engineers has been hired by Millennium Partners to investigate the foundation, but as yet the firm hasn't offered potential solutions. Inspiration might come from the 1998 case of the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino in Las Vegas, which sank almost 19 inches as its weight displaced water from an underlying aquifer. The solution was to drill 536 metal cylinders underneath the casino's 43-story tower, which stabilized the edifice at the cost of between $8 million and $10 million, according to a 2000 article in the Las Vegas Sun.Several engineers and developers contacted by Bloomberg suggested a similar methodology — the insertion of slender, 5-inch to 12-inch supports called ""micropiles"" beneath Millennium Tower's existing foundation — could be effective. Engineers might ""have to go down to the bottom of the garage and drill through the mat slab,"" said Jake Albini, the senior manager of real estate development at Jay Paul, which is developing a 70-floor, mixed-use skyscraper neighboring Millennium Tower. ""It's not an easy task, but nothing's impossible.""But Steven Sanders, the president of Sage Engineers, cautioned against jumping to conclusions. ""You have to be very careful about these different fixes,"" he said. ""They're very dependent on soil conditions and building types."" Millennium Tower, he said, is fairly unique. ""It may be tough to really go down the road and identify possibilities based on historical knowledge,"" he said. ""I think it would be hard and probably dangerous to say, This is done here, why don't you do the same thing there?""Any fix to the building will almost certainly take several years, and the lawsuits over who will pay for it could take even longer. In the meantime, residents of the building remain in limbo.""There haven't been a lot of resales in the building since all of this news came out,"" said Gregg Lynn, the Sotheby's broker. ""There's still no clarity about what it takes to fix or stop the problem.""""We can't sell, we can't rent, we can't move,"" said Agabian, the retired scientist. ""I'd sell it in a second if I got fair market value for it."" She corrected herself: ""Well, there's not a fair market for it, because now the fair market for it is zero.""Lynn recently sold deceased venture capitalist Tom Perkins's Millennium Tower penthouse for $13 million but noted that it was purchased by an existing resident and was a unique transaction. The buyer ""was aggressively convinced that this problem is solvable,"" Lynn said, and felt that the apartment was a bargain. (Perkins purchased the apartment for $9.4 million and reportedly spent another $9 million renovating it.)Other residents are stuck.""I'm getting a lot of calls from homeowners in the building who want to make plans to list their places once the settlement solution is announced,"" Lynn said, adding that he had close to 25 clients in the building. ""What we're waiting for is the public announcement for what the solution to the structural concerns might be and how it's going to be paid for."" It's the latter question, Lynn said, that could be the hardest to answer. ""The second is going to be mired in litigation for five to 10 years,"" he continued. ""But from what I hear from people at the top, this is very fixable — we just don't know when the solution is going to be announced.""That's fine for residents who want to stay put — people are ""absolutely passionate about it, the service there is extraordinary, and the HOA is extremely well-run,"" Lynn said — but there are many others who are hoping to move yet are unwilling to sell at fire-sale prices. ""I can't tell you what percentage down the values are,"" Lynn said, ""because nothing is trading.""Currently, just three apartments are on the market: apartment 4E, which has 1,136 square feet and is listed at $1.299 million, or $1,143 a square foot; it last sold in 2013 for $915,000. There's also penthouse 1A, which is 2,706 square feet and is listed at $8.995 million, or $3,324 a square foot; it's been on the market since July and last sold in 2014 for $3 million. The final apartment, 14C, is a one-bedroom, one-bathroom space with 833 square feet. It's on the market for $1.08 million, or $1,296 per square foot, and was listed in December. It last sold for $790,000 in 2012.These can be compared with other new-construction luxury towers, such as the residences at the St. Regis, the Four Seasons, and 181 Fremont, which is still under construction. These properties, whose price per square foot range from about $1,400 to more than $3,000, continue to sell — condos sold at the Four Seasons in October for $11.7 million, at the new development One Rincon Hill for $3.7 million in November, and in the refurbished loft development 6 Mint Plaza for $2.5 million in December, according to Lynn's 2016 San Francisco Condo Report — while Millennium Tower residents have been forced to wait on the sidelines, fretting about whether they're sitting on significant assets or a stratospheric liability.""Everyone at this building is forced to bring the players to the table,"" said Agabian. ""No one has stepped up, not Transbay, nor the city, nor Millennium Partners has done anything to fix this, and we're left holding the bag of you-know-what.""MORE ABOUT REAL ESTATE:Survey Finds That The Most Affordable Major Housing Markets Are In AmericaHomebuying Cheaper Than Renting In Most Of U.S., But For How Long?Real Estate Agents Foresee Year Of Low Inventory, Low ExpectationsFor Home Sellers, Winter Can Break The Ice

But the fact is, Nestle and its corporate brethren in California that actually make things are overtaxed and overregulated, and elected officials treat them not as honored members of the community but as rapacious pirates.A Glendale official, for instance, blithely insisted Nestle's departure was no big deal, but rather an ""opportunity."" Some opportunity.Though Nestle has offered jobs to their affected California employees in far-off places like Missouri, Ohio and Virginia, the city seems to think it will be able to fill their own Nestle job void by growing the high-tech job base.""We just completed a study two weeks ago, which shows that we have more than 1,000 businesses in Glendale that are tech-focused,"" said Darlene Sanchez, Glendale's deputy director of community development. ""We'd like to see some more co-working space that would cater to this burgeoning technology industry that has organically grown here.""Meanwhile, Virginia pulled out all the stops to get Nestle to come, offering tax incentives worth some $16 million. Glendale says it didn't even find out about the move until Wednesday. But there were signs it wanted to leave. Glendale did nothing, as far as we can tell.Still, you may wonder, why did Nestle really go?Well, apart from having higher taxes, absurd housing costs and more regulations than nearly any other state, California's wacky laws have turned the Golden State into a venue of choice for activist groups to file costly class action lawsuits — or to launch anti-corporate PR campaigns against big, wealthy targets like Nestle.In recent years, Nestle has faced two such activist-led actions, both spurious: One involves allegations that Nestle improperly documented its anti-slave-labor policies. Not that it employed slave labor, it just didn't document it online.The other involves Nestle's selling of California mountain water under the Arrowhead brand, a decades-old business that has suddenly become environmentally incorrect.Such corporate harassment is now routine in a state whose top officials and local politicians — virtually all of them far-left progressive Democrats — actively despise capitalism.Until just two years ago, Nestle made its signature ""Hot Pockets"" brand turnovers in another L.A. suburb, Chatsworth. But it couldn't expand. So it moved the operations and hundreds of jobs to Kentucky. If anyone in Los Angeles objected or tried to help them find a way to grow, we're not aware of it.But Nestle is only the latest to understand that California has rolled up the welcome mat for job-creating businesses that actually make things.In recent years, Toyota shifted its U.S. headquarters and thousands of jobs from Torrance, Calif. — another L.A. suburb — to Dallas, while global oil giant Occidental Petroleum moved its corporate HQ from Los Angeles to Houston.Sadly, such tales are common. But because many of the companies that skedaddle are much smaller than Nestle, Toyota or OxyPete, they don't attract as much notice.According to a report by business relocation expert Joseph Vranich, from 2008 through 2015, at least 1,687 California companies pulled up stakes and moved elsewhere. And those are only the reported ones, Vranich says.He cites a rule of thumb among business site-selection experts that five companies leave for each one that actually gets reported in the press. So it's probable that as many as 10,000 companies have left in recent years.Why are they leaving? Despite relentless, Chamber of Commerce-style blather by state and local governments, California is now one of the worst places to do business in America.""In California, costs to run a business are higher than in other states and nations — largely due to the state's tax and regulatory policies — and the business climate shows little chance of improving,"" wrote Vranich, in his 2016 report on business departures.Two years ago, the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation and Thumbtack.com surveyed 12,632 small businesses to grade California for its business-friendliness: It got an F. The American Legislative Exchange Council's ""Rich State, Poor State"" report has ranked California near the bottom in both economic freedom and competitiveness for nine straight years.Survey after survey shows the same thing, but the state doesn't care. As the jobs leave, thousands and thousands of educated, trained workers leave, too.From 2004 to 2013, some 5 million Californians packed their bags, while about 3.9 million people came from other states, according to a report in the Sacramento Bee, citing IRS data. So the state lost over 1 million mostly middle-class people, representing a net loss of about $26 billion in annual income. Remember this statistic the next time California reports, as it does nearly every year, a ""surprising"" shortfall in tax revenues.It's true California is undergoing a tech boom right now — largely because it's mostly an unregulated industry, and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs give lavishly to California's left-wing politicians, who tread lightly on tech.But history shows such booms are fickle, and inevitably turn to bust. In the next downturn we'll again be hearing about ""two Californias"" — one of wealthy, highly educated tech entrepreneurs and the legions of white-collar professionals in major cities, and another of struggling, semi-employed people with little schooling or training, and poor immigrants who are just scraping by.And then the ""secession"" talk will stop, and California will put its hand out for federal aid.Meanwhile, California's clueless officialdom will once again propose more environmental regulations, higher taxes and more spending as the answer. And then wonder why things don't get any better.RELATED:The Golden State's Fiscal FraudCalifornia Doesn't Exist — It's Now Two StatesCalifornia's 'Unexpected' $16 Billion Deficit

But in spite of the popularity of the Disney-licensed toys, partner brands sales only rose 1%.The light growth might be attributed to the in-between timing of movie-related product releases relative to Hasbro's quarter, indicated Jefferies analyst Stephanie Wissink to Reuters early Monday.In the way of ""Star Wars,"" the box office is midway between last December's ""Rogue One,"" and the upcoming ""The Last Jedi,"" which will be released this December.

44,MAT,"Despite persistent fear about bubbles bursting, China's economy continues to grow. Still, even the Xi government appears to realize that the good times might not go on forever. President Xi Jinping recently emphasized the importance of financial stability, calling it a matter of national security.China's ""Gray Rhinos,"" large conglomerates with global reach, long prospered on state credit. In recent years companies such as Wanda, Anbang, HNA Group and Fosun have engaged in an orgy of high-priced foreign acquisitions, mostly financed by Chinese state-controlled banks.However, Beijing business and banking regulators have begun to crack down on the Gray Rhinos and other overextended firms. The Xi government's new attitude also reflects a desire to keep money at home under state control and support the value of the yuan.Instead, the People's Republic of China should reform policies to attract more foreign investment. Although the PRC doesn't need foreign funds as much as before, given the availability of domestic capital, more money invested from whatever source continues to benefit the Chinese economy. Especially useful would be more cash coming in at a time when the government was concerned about too much money going out.The Hinrich Foundation recently released a report on the impact of Western investment on China. The results are particularly important since the once-large welcome mat for foreign enterprises has shrunk considerably.Noted Hinrich: ""American businesses report that protectionist policies, unclear regulations, policies that favor domestic companies, stalled reforms, and what some termed selective enforcement of laws against U.S. and other foreign companies (or at least the reporting of incidents) have made many U.S. companies feel unwelcome in China.""Although China's National Bureau of Statistics estimates the amount and impact of foreign investment, the Hinrich Foundation believes Beijing's numbers understate the role of Western money. Moreover, the simple foreign-direct-investment number does not capture the ultimate impact of invested capital.Majority-owned American firms in 2014 employed 1.67 million people and had sales of $341 billion and value added of $66 billion, almost 30 times U.S. FDI that year. For all U.S. affiliates the combined payroll was more than 2 million and sales were $470 billion.Hinrich expanded its analysis ""to estimate the impact that U.S. companies have on China through their investments, their own operations, their ripple effect through supply chains, their impact on downstream distribution, and the consumer spending of the relevant employees."" The resulting numbers are even more impressive.For instance, majority-owned enterprises have a value added of $310 billion as of 2014 and cumulative value added since 1979 of $1.8 trillion. The former is 131 times the U.S. foreign investment in 2014. The cumulative value added was 30 times the investment.In 2014, 16.7 million jobs were added, about 2.1% of total Chinese employment. The GDP impact averaged 11 times the net income of majority-owned U.S. firms from 2005 to 2014, ""indicating that while the U.S. affiliates have benefited from their presence in China, China's economy has benefited far more.""All American foreign affiliates resulted in $435 billion in value added in 2014 and $2.6 trillion cumulatively. In that year the value added from U.S. investment accounted for 4.2% of the PRC's GDP.The respective multiples of foreign direct investment were 184 and 42. Employment added was 22.8 million people, or 2.9% of Chinese employment. Here, too, the GDP increase was about 11 times the net income of the enterprises concerned.Even these numbers, however, understate the benefits of U.S. investment in China, contended the Foundation. Simple economic measures miss some of the most important advantages, such as ""improving business practices and standards in China.""At a time when Beijing seems inclined to turn inward economically, emphasizing state control and punishing foreign investors, American firms should point out the obvious economic benefits of attracting outside capital. American and other foreign firms could create some of the jobs necessary to employ Chinese workers who have come to expect a better life — and are likely to protest if that future does not materialize.As Beijing attempts to address the serious problems of artificial stimulus, bad loans and dubious investments, China should adopt reforms to reinvigorate its appeal as a profitable location for foreign investment. The Hinrich Foundation report illustrates the significant benefits of past capital flows from overseas. The future could be even better for investors and China alike.

45,MAT,"Alex Naffziger estimates that he has spent as much as $400 on character costumes and other digital tchotchkes while playing a video game that costs $60 at retail — Activision Blizzard's (ATVI) 2016 ""Overwatch.""With gamers like him spending freely to outfit characters with new ""skins,"" in-game purchases are booming and digital content now generates more revenue for Activision than physical games do.""They had a lot of cool skins, and I wanted to make sure that I got them, so I probably spent a good $150"" during the game's most recent sale, he said while standing in line at Activision's booth during the E3 gaming conference in June.Back in the day, buying a new console game was a one-off transaction. That single shiny disc bought from the local game shop (or cartridge, depending on when you played your first title) contained everything needed to become immersed in a far-off digital realm. Now it could be just the start of a long-term relationship with so much profit potential that game publishers like Activision and Electronic Arts (EA) are transforming their businesses into a ""games as a service"" model that keeps players engaged with a title long after it hits shelves.The video game industry's revenue boom comes despite an aging demographic and niche user base, issues that might set off alarms for investors of other tech firms like Twitter (TWTR) or Snapchat-parent Snap (SNAP).The soaring business in virtual goods via in-game ""microtransactions"" also contrasts with the troubles that have beset other industries shifting to a digital-first mindset (see: retail, entertainment). Gamers, it turns out, are happy to spend money online to extend the life of a game they love.IBD'S TAKE: To find the best stocks to buy, focus on the groups that currently are leading the stock market. The Computer Software-Gaming industry recently ranked No. 2 in price performance among 197 groups tracked by IBD, and Activision was the No. 2 stock in the group. Timing, however, is key. Use IBD Stock Checkup to see how Activision, Electronic Arts, Take-Two Interactive and other game stocks rate.""(There's) clear evidence people are willing to spend vast sums of money when given the opportunity for the right experience,"" Jefferies analyst Timothy O'Shea told Investor's Business Daily.And unlike an actual sword or machine gun, a digital version to arm a game character costs almost nothing to produce.Virtual goods vary from game to game. They can include anything from coins to weapons to trains to horse armor. The practice certainly isn't new to PC gamers or enthusiasts of mobile addictions like ""Candy Crush Saga.""But for gamers who play on consoles like the Sony (SNE) PlayStation and Microsoft (MSFT) Xbox, the concept really only took off three or four years ago, spurring a massive growth-engine for publishers.""The R&D costs are minimal; the economics on that sale are incredible,"" said O'Shea.Creating widgets out of pixels takes very little time. ""Maybe for the developers it's like 30 minutes at lunch,"" he joked. But the profits are serious: Microtransaction margins can be a whopping 85%-90%.On top of that, the add-ons can draw players deeper into a game, making it a ""really, really intriguing model,"" said O'Shea.This model involves cultivating an overarching stream of ""live services,"" of which microtransactions of virtual goods are just a part. It also includes e-sports competitions as well as expansion packs or ""map packs"" that unlock new areas of an existing game — essentially, any content updates provided after a game's initial launch.Game publishers ""don't look at a game as a new release and then it's done; they look at a game as something that consumers want to interact with for years rather than weeks,"" said NPD Group's Mat Piscatella. ""And that's leading to the success that's going on in the market right now.""""GTA Online,"" the web extension of Rockstar Games' ""Grand Theft Auto V,"" has reportedly raked in over half a billion dollars from microtransactions. That's according to a legal complaint filed against Rockstar and parent company Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) by the game's producer and former Rockstar North president, Leslie Benzies.""These purchases have a nearly 100% profit margin, subject only to nominal development costs and app store commissions,"" reads the document.And ""GTA Online"" continues to chug along in popularity, despite being released in 2013 — a lifetime ago in gaming years.""Plenty more content is coming"" for that particular title, said Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick on the company's May earnings call. ""Consumers love it. It remains an enormous focus of everyone's attention.""Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson says the ""bigger, better, fewer"" approach has taken hold of video game publishers in the last five years, a safer alternative to trying their luck on untested new titles.""A few weeks ago we set a new (daily active user) record on the back of these new content updates,"" said Blizzard head Michael Morhaime in Activision's Q1 call in May. ""This reflects the evolution of our business from focusing primarily on full game releases to also providing a consistent stream of content for our players. Even without any full game launches this year, we're continuing to add to the depths of our games to serve a very highly engaged community with more content across our portfolio than we ever have before.""In 2016, in-game revenue made up $3.6 billion of Activision Blizzard's $6.6 billion in sales — more than half of the total pie and up 126% from the prior year, notably helped by the takeover of ""Candy Crush Saga"" maker King Digital.And as more people bought entire console titles online and acquired more downloadable content, the overall digital-revenue segment shot up 94% to account for almost three-quarters of total revenue for the year.At Electronic Arts, digital revenue accounted for 61% of the year's nearly $4.9 billion in net sales, as it too embraced the industry's shift.Case in point: the online multiplayer fantasy-soccer mode in EA's popular ""FIFA"" series sells 12-packs of virtual trading cards, which can include coveted star players that gamers can add to their teams. On its own, ""Ultimate Team"" accounted for $832 million in net sales for the year, or about 17% of EA's 2016 revenue.""EA's games today are live services — amazing experiences that we update and evolve to deliver ongoing fun that keeps players engaged, connects them to their friends, brings them more content and grows our network,"" said EA CEO Andrew Wilson on the company's Q4 earnings call in May. ""This strategy has been at the core of our digital transformation, and today our live services are some of the strongest and most vibrant in the industry.""EA management pegged features like virtual cards as one of the key growth drivers for the current fiscal year, alongside its mobile business and ""Star Wars Battlefront II."" Officials touted Ultimate Team as a ""gateway"" to e-sports competitions, another budding revenue stream.""It's like selling airline tickets; some people pay much more to fly first class and many opt for the coach experience,"" Jefferies' O'Shea wrote in a note. ""Applied in the right way, the trading card business model results in larger audiences, deeper engagement  and higher profits.""Still, even as the live-services model takes hold, some gamers complain about microtransactions and the industry's efforts to make them shell out for more content after they've already bought a game. The idea of paying for more powerful weapons or more lives strikes some as unfair.Another common complaint is that the microtransaction model promotes ""pay to win"" instead of ""play to win.""""I'm OK if it's just an extra option,"" said 27-year-old Joseph Vasquez at E3. ""But they've kind of turned it into where, if you want to really unlock a lot of things, unless you're willing to play months-on-end straight, then you're going to want to spend some extra money on top of the $60 you've already spent, which is kind of a cheap tactic — a cheap business tactic, I think.""But such opposition might not rattle the bottom lines of Activision and Electronic Arts.In fact, Wall Street remains bullish on the video game sector.""You don't need huge growth among the player base to drive continued increase in revenue per player,"" according to Piper Jaffray's Mike Olson. He said solid sales of PlayStations, Xboxes and other consoles point to an expanded addressable market that is ""hungry for new technology.""Piper Jaffray's biannual teen survey still shows great interest from Gen Z. So even though the average gamer is older, the overall age range of the video gaming community is actually widening, Olson says. That translates to more, not fewer, revenue opportunities.Underscoring that cross-generational opportunity is 37-year-old Aurelio Rubio and his four kids: two daughters and two sons. Between the five of them, the family currently uses three PS4s, one Xbox One and one Nintendo Switch.Since everyone has his or her own TV and console, Rubio is used to buying several copies of each game — and by extension, several copies of the same expansion packs and other digital content.""For us, it's the way we bond,"" said Rubio, who estimates that he has spent thousands of dollars on video games in his lifetime. ""As a family thing, we bond together. It adds that value.""

46,MAT,"The same principles that led to Willie Davis starring on the football field, helped him tackle the business world and succeed there too.Davis, 82, was the Hall of Fame defensive end on the Green Bay Packers' 1960s dynasty teams. Under their legendary coach Vince Lombardi and with players like quarterback Bart Starr and guard Jerry Kramer, Davis and the Packers won five NFL titles including the first two Super Bowls.Davis went on to a successful business career that has spanned over 45 years and brought him acclaim and financial rewards as an entrepreneur in the beverage and radio industries. He's also sat on the board of directors of several Fortune 500 companies.""The emphasis on good habits is something that I learned from Coach Lombardi and have preached to myself over my years as a business leader,"" Davis wrote in ""Closing the Gap: Lombardi, The Packers Dynasty And The Pursuit Of Excellence."" ""We can deceive ourselves by thinking that having a clear goal in mind is enough to keep us on track, but it's not. … We must develop good habits to keep on the path.""Good habits included individual responsibility, accountability, self-discipline, commitment, focus, and hard work. There is nothing new and revolutionary in this philosophy. We all know what kind of results these kinds of good habits can bring.""They brought Davis such results as being named to the All-NFL team five times in his 12-year career while never missing a game. As the captain of the Packers' defense, the lightning-quick 6-foot-3, 250-pound Davis was prolific at sacking quarterbacks in an era when that wasn't yet an official stat.He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1981.Davis founded Willie Davis Distributing in 1970, which distributed Schlitz along with other beer brands, and All-Pro Broadcasting, which now owns several radio stations, in 1976. Both were struggling, renamed entities that he turned around by applying the lessons he learned as an athlete. Davis matched that with his intense work ethic and became ""notorious for my attention to detail in planning,"" he says.Davis' business acumen made him a sought-after board of directors member, and those he has served on include the boards of Dow Chemical (DOW), MGM Resorts International (MGM), Schlitz Brewing, Sara Lee, American Express (AXP) and Mattel (MAT) — and the Green Bay Packers.Bart Starr wrote in the foreword to Davis' book ""Willie took his work seriously, both as a football player and later on in his many business ventures. That discipline has led him to unbelievable success. … Willie has been the same great guy. He's been very humble, looking at hard work and success as a responsibility.""""I am proud of my achievements,"" Davis said, ""but I am even more proud of the work I have done to earn them.""The late billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, founder of MGM Resorts said, ""Willie's smart as a whip. ... I thought so well of him and what he could bring to the board, but he was just such a kind person.""Jim Robinson, former CEO and president of American Express said ""(Davis) quickly became a contributing, thoughtful director who listened, did his homework, and worked as hard as he could.""Born in Lisbon, La., Davis grew up in Texarkana, Ark. His mother raised him and his siblings alone after his father left the family when Willie was 8 years old. His family was poor, but his mother's spirit was high.Davis said his mother often told him, ""'I want you to go to school, get an education, get a good job, and be a better man than your father.'""I would be as determined as her,"" Davis wrote. ""I would work as much as her. I would be as responsible and aggressive as this woman who was managing to work multiple jobs and raise three kids on her own. I owed her that.""Davis' first aim from childhood wasn't to be a football star but a business one, so he could take care of his mother and siblings.""I was always a goal-setter,"" he said. ""I saw what I wanted, and no matter what it was, I worked to get there. I knew I didn't want to be poor. I knew I wanted to go to college and get a good job. … I was born determined.""When young Willie observed how people flocked to a local family grocer's store, he announced to his mother that he wanted to own his own business eventually. The European grocer became Willie's friend and mentor, and he worked for him from age 10 to 17.""I learned about loyalty, commitment, and compassion while developing a strong work ethic, a sense of community, and an understanding of how to connect with people,"" Davis wrote.After his mother refused to allow him to play high school football, Davis insisted and she relented. He went on to star and received football scholarships from colleges.""I quickly developed a reputation as a ferocious and tenacious athlete who never quit,"" Davis wrote. ""I would … learn from my mistakes, set goals, and always look to execute better.""Davis chose to attend Grambling State University largely due to their legendary coach, Eddie Robinson. ""He was a father figure, a friend, and a disciplinarian,"" Davis said. ""Coach Robinson was about preparation both on and off the field. I attribute much of my success to (him).""Davis was the 181st player taken in the 1956 NFL draft, selected by the Cleveland Browns. After a two-year army stint, Davis joined the Browns in 1958 and started soaking in the wisdom of their legendary coach and namesake, Paul Brown.The Browns couldn't decide if Davis was a defensive end or an offensive lineman. In a game against the New York Giants, though, Davis' defensive tenacity caught the eye of their offensive coordinator, Vince Lombardi.In 1960 Lombardi, as the coach and general manager of the Packers, traded for Davis, who had severe reservations about going to Green Bay, which at the time was considered the Siberia of the NFL. He even considered retiring from the league, at a time when walking away from an NFL salary wasn't unheard of.Davis then spoke with Lombardi and was overwhelmed by the coach's determination and vision.""We feel with his quickness, (Davis) can be a great pass rusher,"" Lombardi said upon acquiring him.In 1970, the 57-year-old Lombardi, who was dying of colon cancer, told Davis on his deathbed, ""Willie, you are the best deal I ever made.""""Coach Vince Lombardi was also the single most influential person in my adult life,"" Davis said. ""Coach Lombardi (turned) me into a Hall of Fame player and a business leader who has always reached for something more. … We learned that everything we put into preparing, working, and executing in each meeting, practice, and game was a microcosm of how we would live our lives. That's why it was so important to him that we always work hard, that we succeed.""""I did quickly develop respect for Willie, mainly because I saw how hard he worked,"" said his former teammate Jerry Kramer. ""I saw Willie going to the University of Chicago and working on his MBA. That was impressive to me because here was a guy thinking about his future, life after football, and planning ahead.""During his playing days, Davis had a relationship with the Schlitz beer company and was in their management training program, and after his NFL retirement they suggested he buy a struggling distributorship in South Central Los Angeles in 1970. Davis invested everything he had and took a large loan, becoming the first black person to own a distribution company with a major brewery.While he had no experience in his new position, ""there are always mentors if we're smart enough to find them and listen to them,"" he wrote.When addressing his employees for the first time as the new owner, Davis issued a decree: ""I'm not sure how we will gauge our success or just how much we will accomplish, but we will not fail.""""I have used a variation of those words with every one of my business ventures,"" he wrote. ""It's pure Lombardi. … I couldn't accept failure because I couldn't comprehend it, and I didn't want anyone in my company to entertain any notion of it.""Son Duane Davis, the operations manager of All-Pro Broadcasting, said his father ""has always stressed to me that passion is something you absolutely need to accomplish any goal.""Willie Davis took his distributorship from the lowest of the 13 area branches in sales to the highest. He'd use his same principles with All-Pro Broadcasting to take the radio station from the brink of bankruptcy when he bought it and turn it into a thriving concern. Those principles included goal-setting combined with good habits, attention to detail, surrounding yourself with people of quality, and adherence to what he called ""Lombardi time"" — always being at least 15 minutes early.When told that the radio industry business was fun, Davis told his employees the only way business is fun is if it is successful.""He's easy to work for … but still expects everyone to work hard,"" said Edna Garnet, a Davis assistant for more than 40 years. ""He's also very fair, and he's caring.""""In football, we talk about not just physical strength but also mental toughness, a psychological fortitude that comes from being emotionally invested in what you're doing,""  Davis said.""That's what sets apart the winners. It's the same way in life. There will always be challenges as well as opportunities, and only those who are physically prepared, mentally tough, and spiritually focused will be able to overcome or take advantage of the moment.""Hall of Fame defensive lineman and five time champion with the Green Bay Packers. Respected businessman who thrived in the beer distribution and radio industries. Has sat on numerous board of directors.Overcame: Impoverished circumstances and then a lack of business experience.Lesson: It's not just what you know, but what you can do.""Know where you want to go and get there. … I can assure you it will not be achieved in just a few big steps but rather a series of small steps along the way. But figure out what you want to do, what you want to achieve, and then do the work to get there. It is possible.""""Good or bad, habits will soon become the natural thing to do.""""If we are truly passionate about achieving that goal, we will plan, strategize, and work toward achieving it. Each time we hit one goal, we revel in it briefly and then look to what's next. That's how you succeed.""""Achieving a goal and celebrating that achievement creates drive in an individual.""""I firmly believe that any man's finest hour, the greatest fulfillment of all that he holds dear, is that moment when he has worked his heart out in a good cause and lies exhausted on the field of battle — victorious.""

47,MAT,"Raking in $29 million on one night alone, the debut of ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" marked the biggest Thursday preview of the year.The newest Lucasfilm movie beat out another Disney (DIS) property, ""Captain America: Civil War"" ($25 million), as well as the Warner Bros. summer release ""Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice"" ($27.7 million) for the top Thursday night preview spot, according to Box Office Mojo.Disney stock fell 0.5% to 103.91 as it consolidates near the top of a seven-month base. Time Warner (TWX), which owns Warner Bros., dipped 0.55% in the stock market today. Toy makers Hasbro (HAS) and Mattel (MAT) fell 2.4% and 0.9%, respectively.Expectations for this ""Star Wars"" spinoff, the first non-""Episode"" addition to the film franchise, are lower than that of last year's ""Star Wars: Episode VII — The Force Awakens,"" which ultimately cracked the $2 billion milestone at the global box office. (According to Variety, ""The Force Awakens"" pulled $57 million on its Thursday night preview.)Minus its original characters, save for Darth Vader, a ""Star Wars""-related movie raised a few question marks in the fan community. Would Disney's quest to maximize its Lucasfilm acquisition lead to the dilution of the franchise?But reviews of the film have mostly been stellar, with critics hailing it as a darker, more ""grown-up"" movie. And plotwise, it looks to be a fairly direct prequel to the original 1977 ""Star Wars"" (and chronologically follows 2005's ""Revenge of the Sith"").IBD's TAKE: As ESPN's cord-cutting woes face scrutiny, Disney's studio segment continues to shine. But can it stay on this highflying path? Here's why ""Rogue One"" matters to Disney more than you think.""Rogue One"" is so far projected to tally $120 million to $150 million domestically on opening weekend, though Piper Jaffray noted this week that the film was already tracking ahead of its expectations.RELATED:'Rogue One' Reviews Are In: Here's What The Critics Are SayingDisney Seeks Rebel Alliance For Digital Movie LockersEarly 'Rogue One' Reactions: 'Dark,' 'Incredible,' 'A War Movie' Disney's 'Rogue One' Is No Womp Rat: Up To $150 Million Opening Seen'Rogue One' Goes Rogue: Help Us Nissan, You're Our Only HopeNew 'Rogue One' Trailer Promises More Vader, Rebellion, Daddy IssuesDisney's 'Rogue One' May Not Have The Force Of 'Force Awakens'

""We know that shoppers buy toys year-round and by creating a fun, inviting toy shop, with some of the biggest brands and hottest products, we will entice families to shop and spend more at JCPenney.""The shop-in-shop concept has bred success before for the department store.

51,MAT,"The Pentagon's acquisition costs for Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 will rise yet again despite President Trump's assurance that he would lower ""out of control"" costs for the stealth fighter.Acquisition costs for the the advanced fighter will increase by $27.5 billion, to $406.5 billion, according to a Selected Acquisition Report submitted to Congress Monday, the Defense Department's Joint Program Office confirmed late Monday, following a report by Bloomberg News. Acquisition cost estimates for the program had fallen from a high of $398.5 billion in early 2014 to $379 billion currently.That will push total program costs up 1.8% to $1.53 trillion.Vice Admiral Mat Winter, F-35 Program Executive Officer, said in a release that the cost increases were ""largely driven by the adjustments made to the U.S. planned production profile.""The Air Force is cutting the number of F-35A models procured yearly to 60 from 80, which pushes out the acquisition range by six more years to fiscal year 2044. The JPO also said fly away costs for the A model and the Navy's C variant increased  ""due to profile changes"" and the Marines will get 13 more F-35Bs.Fly away costs for the F-35A which includes the engine, went to $111.3 million from $100.6 million in the prior year SAR. Costs for the C model rose to $112.4 million from $110.7 million.But the JPO said prices negotiated with Lockheed and engine maker United Technologies (UTX)-unit Pratt & Whitney ""continue to be below SAR estimates.""Lockheed shares closed up 0.1% to 285.57 on the stock market today, hitting a new record high intraday.

They're just within the 5% chase zone going up to 262 from the 249.53 buy point.The F-35 is known for being overbudget and behind schedule. But the F-35 program office has pointed out recent cost reductions and said the jet is meeting an adjusted schedule.An April Government Accountability Office found that testing delays could add over $1 billion to the cost of the stealth fighter and delay the Navy's timeline for declaring its version of the jet combat-ready next year. But the Pentagon refuted that figure.Trump has been the biggest critic of the F-35 and vowed to get a better deal from Lockheed and look at more Boeing (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornets for the Navy instead to cut costs.Boeing shares climbed 0.8% to 203.96, further extended out of buy range and hitting a new record high intraday.United Technologies rose 0.4% to 123.06, also hitting an all-time high intraday.RELATED: Amid New Russia Threat, Lockheed's F-35, F-22 May Face Biggest Test Yet

53,MAT,"Big-budget video game releases from the major publishers will fight for attention at the E3 trade show in Los Angeles next week, with new consoles, virtual reality and e-sports also expected to generate buzz.E3, short for Electronic Entertainment Expo, officially begins Tuesday and will run for three days at the Los Angeles Convention Center and downtown L.A. locales. But preshow events by the major companies involved begin Saturday.Activision Blizzard (ATVI) will use the show to promote combat game ""Call of Duty: WWII,"" due out Nov. 3, and sci-fi adventure game ""Destiny 2,"" set for release Sept. 8.Strong reviews for those games from E3 would give investors confidence in their performance this holiday season, Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wingren said in a report Tuesday.Sales of the last iteration of ""Call of Duty,"" called ""Infinite Warfare,"" were disappointing and Activision has gone back to the roots of the franchise with a game set in World War II for the upcoming edition.Electronic Arts (EA) is holding its own event ahead of E3 called EA Play, which runs Saturday through Monday at the Hollywood Palladium. EA will be promoting movie tie-in game ""Star Wars Battlefront 2"" and other major titles at the fan-focused event.""'Star Wars Battlefront 2' will be the largest focus"" for EA, Wingren said. ""Generally, the previous edition wasn't that well received by critics. The new version promises a revamped experience. It's the most important game release of the year for EA, in our view.""Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) isn't expected to make much of a splash at E3 because its biggest upcoming game ""Red Dead Redemption 2"" was delayed until spring 2018 from this fall. Instead, Take-Two is likely to show off its upcoming sports titles ""NBA 2K18"" and ""WWE 2K18.""IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks now includes two game companies: Activision and NetEase.Meanwhile, Ubisoft is expected to tout the newest game in its ""Assassin's Creed"" series, among others.Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said the star of E3 week for gamers and investors alike is expected to be ""Star Wars Battlefront 2.""""Unlike its predecessor, the newest Battlefront will include a single player campaign, multiplayer classes, and locations from all three eras (prequel, classic, and new trilogy),"" Pachter said.While EA won't be exhibiting at E3, its games likely will be spotlighted by console makers Microsoft (MSFT) and Sony (SNE).Sony's PlayStation 4 console is the top-selling living-room game box in the current cycle, with Microsoft's Xbox One coming in a distant second.Microsoft hopes to win over hard-core gamers with its Project Scorpio console, which will feature 4K gameplay and support for virtual-reality headsets when it is released this holiday season.""The key question mark about Project Scorpio is its price, with speculation that its supposedly unrivaled power will require a starting price of $499 or more,"" Pachter said. ""If that is the case, we expect Project Scorpio to underwhelm at retail, as has PS4 Pro, which costs $399.""NPD Group analyst Mat Piscatella said Microsoft's Project Scorpio is what he's most interested in hearing about at E3. He wants to get details on pricing, software support and services at the show, he said in a report.Nintendo's (NTDOY) Switch console has gotten off to a brisk start since its supply-constrained launch on March 3. But to keep the momentum going it will need to announce a rich game software slate at E3, Pachter said.Big upcoming releases for Nintendo Switch include ""Super Mario Odyssey"" and ""Splatoon 2,"" both of which will be highlighted at E3, Pachter said.Virtual-reality gaming will be a popular topic at E3 again, with Sony expected to announce multiple new games for its PlayStation VR headset, Pachter said. Sony announced Monday that it has sold over 1 million units of PlayStation VR.Another hot topic will be e-sports, or professional video game tournaments. Activision Blizzard, EA and Take-Two all are investing in the fast-growing segment of the games business.RELATED:Take-Two Gallops Higher On Bullish Analyst Reports

57,MAT,"President Donald Trump's biggest achievement in his first 100 days? Easy. He stopped the left.Measure Trump's first 100 days not just by looking at what he has or has not accomplished. Look at what America would have experienced under the alternative: Hillary Clinton.Under Clinton, the debate would not be on how to replace ObamaCare, but how quickly can the left realize its ultimate ambition, a Canadian-style, single-payer system. Under Clinton, the issue would not be how steep the tax cuts, but how many ""rich"" people, also known as job creators, would experience yet another growth-restricting tax hike.Under Clinton, the $100 billion-plus annually in new regulations imposed by President Barack Obama — much of it to fight ""climate change"" — would continue to rise. This has stopped. President Trump signed an executive order that requires an elimination of two regulations for every new regulation proposed by an executive department or agency in 2017, with a zero-dollar net increase in the cost of regulations.Under Clinton, newly confirmed conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch would've been another Ruth Bader Ginsburg/Sonia Sotomayor/Elena Kagan clone. Four left-wing SCOTUS justices, in the Heller case, ruled that there is not an individual right to keep and bear arms. Spare us a fifth one.Trump, too, has put the left-wing media on notice. No more Mr. Nice Guy. Through WikiLeaks, we found that John Harwood, a debate moderator, emailed a letter to Hillary Clinton campaign manager John Podesta, bragging about a question he had put to Donald Trump. He also emailed advice on dealing with the challenge posed by Dr. Ben Carson. Staffers for newsmen Jake Tapper and Wolf Blitzer of CNN contacted the Democratic National Committee to seek questions they might put to Republican presidential candidates. There were many other examples of flat-out collusion, well beyond the liberal bias we've come to expect.President Trump also changed eight years of Obama's ""leading from behind"" foreign policy by using our largest non-nuclear bomb on ISIS in Afghanistan and bombing Syria for its use of chemical weapons. Under Obama, we pulled out all the troops from Iraq, despite the objections of his foreign policy and national security and defense teams. One of the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, now-retired Army Gen. Ray Odierno, said: ""I go back to the work we did in 2007 (through) 2010, and we got into a place that was really good. Violence was low, the economy was growing, politics looked like it was heading in the right direction. ... We thought we had it going exactly in the right direction, but now we watch it fall apart. It's frustrating. ... I think, maybe, if we had stayed a little more engaged, I think maybe it might have prevented it.""Under Obama, we bombed Libya, a mission that the Obama administration admitted was done for humanitarian reasons. Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi had paid reparations for the terrorist explosion of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. And following the American-led invasion of Iraq, Gadhafi had surrendered his weapons of mass destruction to the U.S. Yet under President Obama, America joined the French and British in bombing Libya to rid the country of Gadhafi. Incredibly, after criticizing President George W. Bush for not thinking through the invasion of Iraq, when Obama was asked what he thought was the ""biggest mistake"" of his presidency, Obama said, ""Probably failing to plan for the day after what I think was the right thing to do in intervening in Libya.""For the most part, President Trump has delivered on his promises, or has attempted to deliver on them.Take immigration. While the wall construction has not begun, nor has Trump been able to figure out a way to get Mexico to pay for it, a psychological wall has already gone up. Border-crossing apprehensions were down more than 60% from January to March, after Trump made it clear the welcome mat for illegal entry has been rolled up.As for the so-called ""failure"" to repeal and replace ObamaCare, businesspeople nevertheless have confidence that whatever emerges will be less expensive, less onerous and less intrusive than what they would have faced under a President Hillary Clinton.Ultimately, Trump will likely be judged on one thing — the economy. If he manages a 4% GDP growth, as promised during the campaign, few will care about his nocturnal tweets.After 100 days of Trump, the earth did not open up and swallow America. His critics can crawl out from under the bed. The stock market has hit record highs; small-business and consumer confidence polls show optimism in levels not seen anywhere from 10 to nearly 40 years, depending upon the poll. Something is happening.When Ronald Reagan died, George Will wrote: ""Today Americans gratefully recall that at a turbulent moment in their national epic, Reagan became the great reassurer, the steadying captain of our clipper ship. He calmed the passengers — and the sea.""It's not too soon to wonder whether someday something similar might be said of President Trump.

58,MAT,"XThe stock market vacillated between gains and losses in Friday morning trading, ending up little changed. Losses were light compared to the last two days of gains. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 moved down 0.1%, while the Dow edged higher, buoyed by a strong earnings report. Among the Dow industrials, credit card processor Visa (V) followed up competitor American Express's (AXP) strong earnings release on Thursday with an earnings beat of its own. Visa handily surpassed both earnings and sales estimates, causing the stock to boost 2% at the open, but gains were pared as shares traded 0.4% higher.Pacing the advancers was Microsoft (MSFT), which rose 1.6% as it notched a new 52-week high. The computer software company reclaimed a 66.01 flat-base entry as volume trended about 70% above average.On the downside, General Electric (VZ) followed up with a 1.2% drop, which comes one day after Thursday's 1% fall when Verizon missed Q1 profit and revenue expectations. Tesla (TSLA) hit a speed bump on Thursday, but shares are rebounding modestly in the stock market today. Tesla announced a recall for 53,000 Model S and X vehicles after issues arose with its electric parking brakes. No injuries or accidents have been related to it. Shares rose 1% as they remain above the 300 price level and about 6% above a 287.49 cup-base buy point.Among S&P 500 components, Toy maker Mattel (MAT) plunged over 11% after disappointing investors with worse-than-expected quarterly earnings and sales figures. Shares have been in an downtrend since April 2016. On the upside, industrial bellwether Honeywell (HON) jumped 2.7% as a bullish earnings release lit a fire under the stock. Shares moved above a 127.62 flat-base entry in early trading. Among leading growth stocks, China-based TAL Education (TAL) paced the advancers with a 3.2% rise, while mortgage software provider Ellie Mae (ELLI) completed its comeback, notching a fresh all-time high. After declining as much as 29% from highs in December, shares have battled back and stand 11% above a 98.88 cup-with-handle entry.On the downside, private mortgage insurer Essent Group (ESNT) dropped almost 3% after being downgraded to neutral from overweight early Friday by JPMorgan (JPM).

59,MAT,"Ahead of the December release of ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi,"" Walt Disney (DIS) and Lucasfilm announced the sequel to Force Friday, the major ""Star Wars"" geekout event that includes the launch of toys, collectibles, books, apparel and other products.The last Force Friday occurred a few months prior to the theatrical release of 2015's ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens."" This one starts at 12:01 a.m. on Friday, Sept. 1, said Disney, with stores participating globally. It could be a big day for toy makers such as Hasbro (HAS) and Mattel (MAT).Disney shares rose 0.5% to 110.72 on the stock market today. Hasbro and Mattel 0.2% and 1.3%, respectively, two days ahead of the industry's annual Toy Fair in New York City.The ongoing strength of the ""Star Wars"" movie franchise has translated into sales for its consumer products unit, although the segment registered a year-over-year decline in its most recent quarter due to the strength of ""The Force Awakens"" in the prior-year quarter.IBD'S TAKE: The Force is strong with Disney's stock. After tumbling in August 2015 on ESPN subscriber concerns, the stock finally began reviving last October. Disney broke out of a cup-with-handle base with a 106.36 buy point in early January, and remains within the 5% chase zone.On Disney's earnings call last week, management indicated that growth in its consumer products segment would mostly come from the back half of the year, although ""Star Wars"" is not the only driver.""The properties that are really going to contribute to that are going to be Cars and Spider-Man, and we expect that to be a strong back half of the year for consumer products,"" said Disney CFO Christine McCarthy.The most recent ""Star Wars"" release, ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"" is the first billion-dollar movie of the fiscal year, said CEO Bob Iger on the call last week. He called ""The Last Jedi"" a ""great next chapter in the iconic Skywalker family saga.""A Han Solo origin movie is in the works.RELATED:GOP Border-Tax Plan Would Sock U.S. Tourism — Including Trump HotelsDisney Chief's Confidence In ESPN Comes In Part From ...

Lab also plan to codevelop new products ""designed to aid child development through the use of cutting-edge technology and smart, interactive learning."" Products will hit shelves in mid-2017.Mattel has a growing number of interactive toys and games in its arsenal, from the Fisher-Price Think & Learn Code-a-pillar to the Nabi Aristotle, the latter of which debuted at CES and includes the integration of Amazon's (AMZN) Alexa digital voice assistant.""We look forward to supporting Mattel's growth through our robust data and commerce technology infrastructure, which will help to elevate their overall business from product development to brand-building to rural penetration for this unique and massive market,"" said Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang in the statement.Mattel shares were up 0.6% to close at 25.69 on the stock market today. Rival Hasbro (HAS) shares dipped 0.3% to 97.80. Alibaba lost 1.5% to 101.59.In Mattel's most recent quarterly earnings report, management noted strong performance in China, calling it a ""priority emerging market"" during the call.RELATED:Hasbro Stock Soars Through Buy Zone On Strong Earnings, Dividend HikeMattel's Aristotle Connects Wired Child, Smart Home

62,MAT,"Few abbreviations in the investment trade are as intoxicating as IPO — initial public offering. The challenge is this: When is the right time to buy a new issue? After all, it can be highly tempting to jump quickly into a new stock.As with any stock, you must wait for a proper base to form in order to spot a buy point that offers potential for big gains and lower risk. Focus on those with excellent growth in earnings and sales as well as solid industry group strength.In some cases, a stock with outstanding credentials will take off after trading for only a few weeks. But in most cases, patience is key.Fledgling stocks have no trading history. This limits an investor's ability to gauge whether shares are fairly priced.In some cases, shares seem to be drastically underpriced — especially during a weak market — so that they will shoot higher at the start of trading. Consider SouFun Holdings, a Chinese real estate marketer that went public Sept. 17, 2010, at 42.50 a share. It opened its first day of trade in the 60s and closed at 73.50. SouFun, now known as Fang Holdings (SFUN), had a rough ride over the next few years.IPOs came back in fashion in 2010 after a slump, with nearly 120 new stocks hitting U.S. markets through November that year. Also at that time, a surprising 60% of those had traded above their IPO prices. Jinko Solar (JKS) and China New Borun (BORN) are two that have turned in explosive advances. Use the IPO AfterMarket feature, found at the top of the New America page in IBD Weekly, to track significant moves by new issues. IPOs can also tell a riveting story. Recent offerings have revealed new or developing areas in technology, energy, fashion, travel and dining.But the charming tales and potential for outsize returns also carry above-average risks. As stocks such as China New Borun and Fang have shown, new issues can post sobering falls.JA Solar (JASO) rose 41% in the three weeks after its IPO in February 2007. But the stock at that point held subpar ratings for its earnings performance and other factors.Investors were better off waiting. This meant risking being locked out of a fast advance right at the start. But a great IPO will eventually offer a solid entry point. This reduces risk, and it's smart to wait until fundamentals improve.JA Solar wasted no time in laying out a welcome mat. The solar cell maker dipped into its first consolidation the week ended March 2 (1). Shares unwound 23% as they shaped a six-week-long cup.During that base, the company reported first-quarter earnings of 6 cents a share, sharply above year-earlier levels. Revenue took a 10-fold leap to more than $43 million.The news, on April 12, sent the stock charging through the base's 21.20 buy point in very heavy trade (2). The Big Picture's Market Pulse table at the time noted that stocks were in a ""confirmed rally,"" but cautious investors may have wanted to see better fundamentals.The next day, April 13, IBD upgraded JA Solar's EPS Rating to a 75 and its Composite Rating to an 80, alongside solid Relative Price Strength and industry group strength ratings. The stock opened the day less than 3% above the base's buy point — a good time to jump in. Shares rocketed higher and held a 36% gain through April 25.JA Solar then turned down, forming a narrow, seven-week double-bottom base (3). As the base formed, the fundamentals strengthened even further. Shares passed the base's 28.19 buy point in soft trade on June 15 (4). Volume kicked in several days later, and shares rose 56% over the next four weeks. JA Solar formed another base and broke out in September to big gains again.(Editor's Note: This column originally ran in the Nov. 9, 2010, edition of IBD.)RELATED:Finding Great IPO Stocks Today: Check IPO LeadersHow To Invest: When To Buy A New Issue Such As Snapchat Owner SnapThe Best Time To Buy Stocks?

64,MAT,"The video-game industry is at a crossroads this holiday season as consumers must decide in what form they want to purchase new game software.Will they buy packaged game software so their kids will have something to open on Christmas morning? Or will they buy game software as digital downloads?How consumers respond will impact the top and bottom lines for game publishers and retailers.The biggest game publishers such as Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Electronic Arts (EA) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) lately have been benefiting from the move to digital downloads, which carry fatter profit margins.IBD'S TAKE: IBD Swing Trader uses CAN SLIM technical and fundamental research to find potential hits, not home runs. The goal is 10% profit within five to 10 days, with losses cut at 3%. Take-Two has been a Swing Trader stock of late.Retailers like GameStop (GME) and Best Buy (BBY) have been hurt by the shift to digital game distribution. But they might be able to compensate for that this holiday season thanks to the availability of new midcycle game consoles and the launch of virtual-reality headsets.""Nothing is better under the Christmas tree than a box to open that has an actual gift,"" NPD analyst Mat Piscatella told IBD.Piscatella said he's seen no data yet to indicate that digital game download rates will be higher this holiday season. Video-game publishers have said top titles can sell 30% of units as digital downloads now. But what percentage is gifted is not known, Piscatella said.Many of those downloads probably are purchased by adult gamers who just want to play a new game right away, without having to get a physical game disc, he said.But game downloads have some disadvantages, such as having to wait for a huge digital file to download and install.""You get it on Christmas Day and hopefully you're playing by New Year's,"" joked DFC Intelligence analyst David Cole.Publishers are offering special editions of games with collectibles and other extras to entice gamers to buy physical copies.At the same time, publishers are incentivizing gamers to get digital downloads by bundling in online season passes and pre-release game play.GameStop has been a canary in the coal mine for changes in the industry. On Tuesday, it reported disappointing fiscal third-quarter sales due in part to the increase in game software downloads.GameStop said new game titles sold below expectations for its fiscal Q3 ended Oct. 29. Analysts say Activision's ""Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare"" was among the games that came up short in physical game sales at GameStop last quarter.On the plus side, GameStop said the Nov. 18 release of Nintendo's (NTDOY) ""Pokemon Sun and Moon"" was the retailer's biggest game launch of the year. Nintendo games tend to have a lower digital download rate than those from other publishers. Nintendo customers tend to be younger.Other major game releases this fall include ""Battlefield 1"" and ""Titanfall 2"" from Electronic Arts and ""Mafia 3"" from Take-Two Interactive Software.Annual sports titles are likely to be big sellers this holiday season, including EA's ""Madden NFL 17"" and ""FIFA 17"" and Take-Two's ""NBA 2K17"" and ""WWE 2K17.""Other games looking to rack up big sales this Christmas include ""Watch Dogs 2"" from Ubisoft, ""Dishonored 2"" from Bethesda Softworks, and ""Final Fantasy 15"" from Square Enix.Publishers are cashing in on the sweet spot of the current game console cycle, where there's a large installed base of consoles in which to sell big game titles.Sony (SNE) is expected to have an installed base of 50 million PlayStation 4 consoles worldwide by year's end, DFC Intelligence said. Rival Microsoft (MSFT) is seen having 28 million Xbox One consoles in use by the end of 2016, DFC said.Game hardware revenue has been in decline this year because of market saturation and lower prices for consoles. Sony and Microsoft are hoping to change that with the recent launch of redesigned and souped-up versions of current consoles. Microsoft has the Xbox One S and Sony has the PlayStation 4 Pro and PS4 Slim. Plus, Nintendo has a retro console in its NES Classic Edition, which comes preinstalled with 30 games.Next year will bring two next-generation consoles: the Nintendo Switch and Microsoft Scorpio.This is the first Christmas season for virtual-reality headsets, including the games-focused Sony PlayStation VR. Other VR headsets include Facebook's (FB) Oculus Rift and HTC's Vive. Plus, there are low-cost VR headsets that use smartphone screens as their display, such as the Samsung Gear VR.Among the big VR games already out are ""Batman: Arkham VR"" from Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, a unit of Time Warner (TWX), and ""NBA 2KVR Experience"" from Take-Two. Electronic Arts is releasing its ""Star Wars Battlefront Rogue One: X-Wing VR Mission"" on Dec. 6.""PS VR launch bundles being sold out pretty much everywhere is a positive sign"" for adoption of virtual reality, Piscatella said. ""There's a lot of excitement around (gaming) hardware and accessories this holiday.""But this could be just a get-to-know-you period for VR. Best Buy, GameStop and others are offering demonstrations of VR systems in their stores to acquaint shoppers with the technology.""Consumers haven't really been introduced to it yet,"" Cole told IBD. ""2017 is the year that VR really gets started.""Best Buy rolled out virtual-reality products to all of its stores during its fiscal third quarter ended Oct. 29, and it has dedicated virtual-reality departments in more than 700 stores, CEO Hubert Joly told analysts on a conference call Nov. 17.Best Buy has given more than 300,000 virtual-reality demonstrations to customers so far, Joly said.And GameStop Chief Operating Officer Tony Bartel said the new gaming hardware products are ""bright spots"" for GameStop.""We're seeing strong demand for new consoles, the PS4 Pro is off to a strong start and VR is generally on the shelves for less than 10 days,"" he said on a conference call with analysts. ""We're also seeing solid consumer interest for the upcoming launch of Switch from Nintendo.""The Switch uses physical media and Nintendo products have historically had a low digital download rate, so we expect this to be a console that drives strong sales of physical product along with the console.""Activision stock fell a fraction to 37.22 in the stock market today, a half-day session that ended at 1 p.m. ET. Shares touched an all-time high of 45.55 on Oct. 25, but also hit a four-month low of 36.32 on Wednesday.EA stock also fell a fraction Friday, to 79.17.

65,MAT,"In 2009, 50 of fashion's leading designers created the hottest ticket of New York City's Fashion Week. The show celebrated a beloved muse on her 50th birthday: The Barbie doll. Barbie debuted in 1959 and ""perseveres today as a cultural icon ... her enchanting essence has allowed generations of women to enter a world of make-believe that knows no boundaries,"" said Vera Wang in InStyle magazine.Barbie is the product of the make-believe and boundless marketing acumen of Ruth Handler, who co-founded Mattel (MAT) with her husband Elliot Handler and Harold Matson in a Los Angeles garage in 1945. Today, Mattel is the world's largest toy manufacturer with sales in 150 countries and annual revenues of over $6 billion. Elliot Handler created many of Mattel's early successes, and Ruth's marketing genius brought them to the masses.Handler was born in Denver in 1916, the tenth child of Jewish immigrants who fled anti-Semitism in Poland. After her mother became ill, infant Ruth went to live with her eldest sister, Sarah, and her husband, Louie Greenwald, hardworking small-business owners who owned a pharmacy, lunch stand and one of Denver's first post-prohibition liquor stores.Handler had a more affluent upbringing than her siblings, whose home was plagued by their father's gambling debts. But hers wasn't a life of leisure; Ruth began working in the Greenwald businesses as soon as she could.In addition to her job at the lunch stand and classes at the University of Denver, 18-year-old Ruth was occupied with Elliot Handler, a young artist she met at a dance. Wanting to see the world, however, she accepted a girlfriend's offer to explore Los Angeles.  Elliot saved up money to attend Los Angeles' Art Center College of Design and soon joined Ruth, who worked in the stenography pool at Paramount Studios. They married in 1938.While Ruth continued at Paramount, Elliot began making a name for himself as a designer of costume jewelry. She often made sales calls for him on her lunch hour. In 1941, she gave birth to a daughter named — you guessed it — Barbara. While a reluctant homemaker, she then had a son — yes, Kenneth — in 1944.In 1945, Elliot and colleague Harold Matson founded Mattel. Ruth, itching to get back in business, suggested they make picture frames, convinced that she could get a local photo studio to place a large order. She was right. Mattel soon outgrew the garage.Mattel had its first hit toy in 1947 with the Uke-A-Doodle, a miniature ukulele, and the Handlers bought out Matson. They had their next hit in 1950 with a hand-cranked low-cost music box inserted into several toys, including the jack-in-the-box.By 1951, Mattel had 600 employees. Ruth, as executive vice president, handled marketing and operations.  ""(Ruth) was very hands-on. She was on the floor doing quality control. She and Elliot had an open hiring policy. She hired for talent,"" Robin Gerber, author of ""Barbie and Ruth,"" told IBD. Their factories employed far more women and people of color than the norms of the day, and in 1951 Mattel earned the Urban League Award for nondiscriminatory hiring practices.In 1955, ABC announced the ""Mickey Mouse Club"" series. Ruth knew instinctively that kids watching other kids play with Mattel toys would be a game-changer. She bet the farm, paying $500,000 for a sponsorship, nearly all of Mattel's net worth. The gamble paid off, and sales of the featured Burp Gun broke records. Mattel's investment in television ads changed the key toy consumer from parent to child and created a year-round demand for toys, a business which had always been seasonal.On a trip to Switzerland in 1956, Ruth spotted the popular ""Lilli"" doll, based on a racy cartoon character in a German newspaper, which had adult features and fashionable outfits, and was marketed to adults as a gag gift. Since the early 1950s, when she observed young Barbara rejecting the child paper dolls in favor of adult ones, Handler had been trying to convince her team that a doll with adult features would be a hit. They nixed it, saying it would be too expensive to manufacture. But in her autobiography ""Dream Doll,"" Ruth wrote that the reluctance ""stemmed mostly from the fact that the doll would have breasts.""Seeing Lilli changed the team's tune. Handler hired marketing psychologist Ernst Dichter to explore whether Barbie's breasts would turn off parents. His advice, after conducting interviews with girls and their mothers? Make them bigger.Barbie debuted in 1959. Handler marketed Barbie as a ""teenage fashion model"" and created a commercial displaying her many different looks. Sales started slow, but once school got out, Barbie flew off the shelves. It took Mattel three years to catch up with consumer demand.In 1960, Mattel went public. In the following years it introduced other iconic toys including Chatty Cathy and Hot Wheels cars. By 1966, Mattel had reached $100 million in sales and was listed on the Fortune 500.By the late 1960s, Mattel's annual sales were over $200 million and its stock offered a 16% return. Mattel implemented a growth strategy of acquiring other companies aimed at youngsters and made a splash by purchasing Ringling Brothers Circus. But sales sagged in the economic recession — compounded by a fire in a Mexican factory that destroyed inventory and a dock workers' strike that halted deliveries. Handler had other battles to fight, though, as she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1970.Upon returning to work after her mastectomy, she discovered that Mattel was implementing ""bill-and-hold,"" a practice of recording sales to be shipped later, in order to maintain its stock price. Bill-and-hold was legal. However, the extent to which Mattel used it meant that it submitted false and misleading information in its financial reports. Handler claimed that she didn't know the full extent of the practice, but many were skeptical that her eye for detail could miss the discrepancies.In 1972, shareholders sued Mattel. In 1974, the SEC began investigating, and she and Elliot left the company. What had led to her recklessness? In an interview with Robin Gerber, Elliot said that with her preternatural drive, Ruth ""couldn't turn it off.""Fortunately for many breast cancer survivors, she didn't turn it off. Unhappy with her awkward prosthetic breast, a friend suggested that she visit sculptor Peyton Massey. With her input, he designed one superior to those she'd worn before. They created Nearly Me, a reasonably-priced, natural-feeling line of prosthetics fitted to women's bra sizes. Nearly Me launched in 1976 in high-end department stores. Letters of gratitude poured in, including one from Betty Ford.But on Feb. 17, 1978, Handler was indicted on 10 counts of mail fraud and making false statements to the SEC and federally insured banks. Convicted, Judge Robert Takasugi fined her $57,000 and gave her a sentence of 500 hours of community service for five years. Handler's probation officer assigned her to help create Foundation for People, which helped young disadvantaged young men with job training.Nearly Me continued its success in the 1980s. In 1989, she and Elliot were inducted into the Toy Industry Hall of Fame. The same year, her poor health convinced her to sell Nearly Me to Spenco Medical.Handler faced her greatest loss, however, in 1994, when her son Kenneth died of AIDS. But Barbie would help bring her out of her grief and return her to the spotlight. When Kenneth told Elliot and Ruth of his disease two years earlier, the Handlers sprang into action. helping with research and care, but his decline was rapid.A surprise visit from her past creation — Barbie — brought Handler unexpected attention and satisfaction in the midst of her mourning. Mattel Executive Jill Barad had created the ""We Girls Can Do Anything"" campaign that capitalized on Barbie's professional achievements. ""Barbie was able to step into the shoes of so many women's careers before they could. There was astronaut Barbie long before there was a real (female astronaut). That's something Ruth should be proud of,"" Tanya Lee Stone, author of ""The Good, the Bad, and the Barbie"" told IBD. In 1994, Barad asked Handler to travel with her, publicizing Barbie's role as a working woman.After years of failing health, Ruth died on April 27, 2002. She spent her final years advocating for breast cancer survivors and examining the ups and downs of her extraordinary career. In the closing lines of ""Dream Doll"" she wrote, ""Even now, at 77, I can say that whatever has driven me for all these years is driving me still, even if at a slower pace. There's still a lot of fight in me, and perhaps the fight's the thing.""Marketing genius and self-confidence propelled Handler to help create Mattel, the Barbie doll and Nearly Me breast prosthetics.Overcame: Lack of college education and few female business role models to start industry-leading Fortune 500 company.Lesson: Find your customers' needs and devise a better way to meet them.Quote: ""I've come full cycle from the first doll with a real breast to answering a real woman's need for a breast.""RELATED:Barbie Vs.

66,MAT,"Some observers have noted that recent IBD/TIPP Poll results seem to show something surprising: Among investors, Hillary Clinton holds a hefty 47% to 39% lead over billionaire businessman Donald Trump, even though it's always assumed the GOP has a lock on the investment class. Has a permanent shift taken place, or is something else at work?Framed another way, Hillary Clinton's plans for trillions of dollars in new spending, higher taxes and more regulation surely don't constitute a welcome mat for investors. So why do they support her?Well, let's start with one basic, uncomfortable fact: The stock market tends to rise in election years, but it rises the most when the incumbent party is elected — no matter which party it is. Data crunched by T. Rowe Price and Ned Davis Research back in 2012 showed that the S&P 500 index rose in 12 of the 16 election years after World War II. That's not too far from the norm for non-election years.What's different is that the S&P had an average 9.2% gain when the incumbent party won, vs. just 2.2% when it lost. So investors seem to like incumbency by either party.But this, of course, is a unique election, with what many in both parties would agree are two uniquely flawed candidates who have very high negatives with the voting public.Given that, why would investors still side with Hillary over Donald?For many investors, Trump's attacks on free trade and the Trans Pacific Partnership, not to mention his threat to impose tariffs on incoming goods, are a serious concern. They worry a Trump presidency might disrupt U.S. trade and hurt the global economy — perhaps even lead to a global recession.But ""none of this is why Wall Street fears a Trump win,"" wrote James M. Meyer, chief investment officer at Tower Bridge Advisors,  in a note to clients last month. ""What little substance he has proposed, like tax cuts and less regulation, should play well on the street.""""What Wall Street fears most is uncertainty. And Trump defines uncertainty with a capital U.""From this standpoint, the risk of supporting Clinton becomes less than the risk of supporting Trump, at least when it comes to economic policy.""A Clinton win could avert the anticipated market uncertainty associated with a win by Donald Trump,"" said Garrett D'Alessandro, CEO and CIO of City National Rochdale, an investment management arm of City National Bank, in a recent memo on the election. ""But a split Congress means that there will likely be no meaningful changes in fiscal policy that would alter the trajectory of the economy or corporate earnings.""And that latter point is key. Americans often complain about ""gridlock"" in Washington. But for investors, gridlock can be beautiful. And it seems they're counting on it. So as harmful as Clinton's tax, spend and regulate policies would be to the economy — and, no doubt about it, they would be very harmful — unless she has control of both houses of Congress, she's unlikely to get what she wants.To investors who have experienced two record stock market crashes in the last 16 years, gridlock sounds pretty good right now. Yes, it will likely mean no major reforms, but it will also reduce the risk of something like the now-collapsing ObamaCare program or the the growth-killing Dodd-Frank law from being passed again.That could be seen in the 2010 and 2012 congressional elections, which returned control of Congress to Republicans after two years of Democrats controlling the White House, the House and the Senate. In the two years following both the 2010 and 2012 change elections — which returned a kind of gridlock back to Washington — the S&P 500 rose 19% and 42%, respectively.Then there are likely some who are cynical enough — and probably rightly so — to note that Hillary Clinton, just like her husband and former President Bill Clinton, talks like a raving left-wing populist in her public speeches, but in fact has tight money ties to Wall Street — in particular Goldman Sachs, but others too.Snippets of Clinton's banal speeches to Wall Street investment banks, delivered at $250,000 a pop, show she poses little if any real threat to those investment banks she often bashes in public speeches. As the WikiLeaks email dumps of her Wall Street speeches plainly show, she's not an Occupy Wall Street supporter by any means. Investors across the country know this.So, no, investors aren't infatuated with Hillary. Nor do they necessarily think she will be a great president.  But some investors do fear the big unknowns of a Trump presidency, especially since he's never held an elective office before. And that just might be enough to make them vote for the other candidate.RELATED:Once Again, Critics Of The IBD/TIPP Poll Get Their Facts WrongWhat Explains The Wide Range Of Poll Results Between IBD/TIPP And Others?IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index Soars As Everybody Wins The White HouseCould Trump Pull A Brexit-Style Surprise In November?IBD/TIPP Presidential Election Tracking Poll: Latest ResultsIBD/TIPP Tracking Poll: The Most Accurate Presidential Poll In America

"
70,MAT,"Taxes: The European Union's laughably misnamed ""competition commission"" has slapped a $15 billion penalty on Apple for supposed back payments of taxes. This is nothing more than a cash grab by money-hunrgy Eurocrats, and is Exhibit A in why the EU is failing.We'll spare you all the dry technicalities of Apple's case because, in fact, the EU is going after a whole slew of mainly U.S. companies that do business there — including Google, Amazon, Starbucks and McDonald's. The reasons in each instance are as varied as the companies themselves.In Apple's case, the EU accuses it of dodging taxes by booking profits not where they're earned, but in Ireland, with which Apple signed a tax deal years ago and where its regional headquarters is.As an example, the EU claims Apple paid 0.005% of its profits as taxes in 2014 — roughly equal to about $50 for every $1 million in profits. For the record, Ireland's corporate rate is 12.5%, about $125,000 per million.So Ireland must be furious about being cheated out of so much tax revenue, right?Wrong. The deal is this: Apple creates jobs, and Ireland keeps taxes low. Simply put, it's a great deal for any country that seeks economic growth — and has the common sense to pursue it.In effect, the EU has gone back and retroactively rewritten tax law to suit its ideas of ""fairness."" It may also slap another $6 billion on Apple's bill for ""interest"" -- which is absurd, considering the EU's negative interest rates.All this has enraged Apple, not known for throwing public tantrums.""The European Commission has launched an effort to rewrite Apple's history in Europe, ignore Ireland's tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process,"" said Apple CEO Tim Cook.""The Commission's case is not about how much Apple pays in taxes, it's about which government collects the money. Apple follows the law and pays all of the taxes we owe wherever we operate. We will appeal and we are confident the decision will be overturned.""The U.S. Treasury is likewise angry, accusing the EU of trying to turn itself into a global tax regulator — imposing taxes on U.S. companies it really has no jurisdiction over, in the name of ""competition."" To top it off, the EU decision comes just two days after a top German official pronounced free-trade talks between the U.S. and EU ""dead.""Whether Apple wins its appeal is questionable. But either way, the EU almost certainly will lose as a result of this.As we said, the EU these days goes after virtually every successful American company that operates in its territory. And it jealously punishes its own members within the 28-nation bloc that actually compete to make their economies better — which is exactly what Ireland did.Europe has fewer and fewer innovative, champion companies these days, because of the massive amounts of regulation they face. So the EU's assault on highly successful U.S. businesses is in part out of envy — Apple iPhones are near ubiquitous across Europe. There is no real European alternative.In going after these American champions that so improve European life, the EU routinely vilifies those it has targeted, treating them as if they were pirates — not job creators.Yet, these corporate villains employ thousands of Europeans, and, yes, also pay taxes. But they never pay enough to satisfy the far-left Eurocracy that has spent the EU into near-bankruptcy.Apple shows what happens when unelected bureaucrats have power to control businesses. In this instance, Margrethe Vestager, the grandly titled EU ""competition commissioner,"" is an inveterate leftist politician from Denmark who has repeatedly gone after successful companies to shake money out of them.This latest salvo will no doubt be greeted with huzzahs in the EU's headquarters in Brussels and Luxembourg. But it shouldn't be.These attacks on successful, mostly U.S.-based companies will backfire horribly. The EU already struggles with high unemployment, low growth and lagging standards of living — but not because Apple isn't paying enough in taxes.Apple employs 22,000 workers in Europe, out of a worldwide workforce of 370,000. And it supports another 257,000 or so jobs at other companies worldwide. Those are huge benefits to the economies they operate in.Would chasing Apple and other winners from Europe serve any purpose?Already, there is talk of companies rethinking their EU strategies. After Brexit, a more pro-business Britain could become a very attractive alternative to the EU's socialist planners. Heck, even strife-torn, authoritarian Turkey is rolling out a welcome mat to Apple.The U.S. is little better. It taxes U.S. companies at an absurdly high 35%, when the average rate for other nations is below 25%. If the U.S. reformed its tax code, the $2 trillion or so stashed overseas in corporate accounts would come flooding back, creating thousands and thousands of jobs.In the meantime, the EU has investigations going on just about every major successful U.S. company doing business there. But companies will only take so much abuse. Sadly, the EU's socialist-leaning rulers show no signs that they get it.RELATED:EU: Apple Must Pay Ireland $14.5 Billion In Taxes No, Brexit Won't Kill U.K. Brexit Fears Weren't Overblown — They were Flat-Out Wrong

71,MAT,"""Borders are the worst invention ever made by politicians."" Those were the words of Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Union's European Commission, at the Alpbach Media Academy last Monday.Nonsense, most readers will surely think, in numbers going far beyond the legions of Americans dismayed with the choices they face in this year's presidential race. But it's worth thinking a bit more about where Juncker is coming from, and the implications of his statement in what is, in Europe as well as America, a fraught political year.Literally, Juncker comes from Luxembourg, a 998-square-mile country wedged between France, Germany and Belgium, where he served as prime minister from 1995 to 2013. If you look up Luxembourg in lists of world economic statistics, you'll find it rated No. 2 in gross domestic product per capita.That's thanks to what Juncker called politicians' worst invention ever, borders. For Luxembourg is a financial haven and headquarters of the world's largest steel company, ArcelorMittal. Without their borders and national laws, the 576,000 Luxembourgers wouldn't be as affluent as they are.But Juncker, having moved on from a big post in a small nation to the unelected leadership of a league of most European nations, is thinking farther back, to 1914 and 1940, when Luxembourg as well as Belgium and much of France were overrun by German troops in two horrifying world wars. Recalling a warning from former French President Francois Mitterrand, who played an ambiguous part in the second of those wars, Juncker said, ""We have to fight against nationalism, we have the duty not to follow populists but to block the avenue of populists.""Such is the faith of the Eurocrats: The EU exists to prevent another war between France and Germany. Never mind that the chance of such a war has been zero since 1945, 71 years ago. Never mind that Hitler did not respect borders, but erased them.Juncker was denouncing Austria and other nations for erecting border controls to keep out Muslim refugees. Evidently he believes that World War III will somehow break out if they are kept out.In a similar vein, Hillary Clinton opposes deportation of the bulk of the 11 million illegal immigrants in this country who haven't been convicted of felonies. That would put out a welcome mat to millions of other potential migrants who might come here in violation of U.S. laws. And curiously, Donald Trump has pivoted to suggesting he might not deport all that many illegals either.Denigration of borders is an example of what Nico Colchester in a famous 1988 Economist leader (editorial, in Britspeak) called sogginess. The opposite was crunchiness. ""Crunchy systems are those in which small changes have big effects leaving those affected by them in no doubt whether they are up or down,"" Colchester wrote. ""Sogginess is comfortable uncertainty.""Borders are crunchy, or ought to be. But those inclined to sogginess don't like them that way. Wouldn't refugees from Syria -- or young men from Libya or Bangladesh or Eritrea or Honduras -- be better off in Europe or the United States than where they are? If so, then why should we let a dotted line on a map stand in their way? So let's replace crunchy restrictions with soggy benevolence and let as many come in as they want.To Jean-Claude Juncker's dismay, European voters are recoiling against this, not least in Germany, whose chancellor Angela Merkel declared open doors to 800,000 newcomers -- 1% of pre-existing population -- in September 2015. Earnest editorialists argued that incoming young men would supply the labor force low-birth-rate Germany needs. None of the great and good figured they wouldn't blend soggily in.Those prognostications proved wrong. Refugees asked to work say they are guests of Angela Merkel. Despite government and media cover-ups, voters found out that ""refugees"" have been assaulting women by the thousands and setting off bombs and wielding axes against innocent bystanders.Borders, it turns out, are not the worst inventions ever made by politicians. They operate most of the time to protect a citizenry that, in Europe and North America, is for the most part productive and tolerant and observant of common moral norms and cultural behaviors. Inviting in unlimited numbers of young men who share none of these traits is generosity turned to sogginess -- and is being met with crunchy rejection.America's plight is less dire than Europe's. But Clinton's sogginess on borders could face crunchy rejection too, depending on what Donald Trump's position turns out to be.

72,MAT,"Trade: On the campaign trail, both Republican candidate Donald Trump and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton have become increasingly anti-free trade. Free traders may be in for a nasty surprise.Right now, given current polls, Clinton seems most likely to be the next chief economic policy maker. If so, she will be the most anti-free trade leader of a major party since World War II.In recent days, Clinton has criticized trade deals that she says hurt jobs, singling out the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a mega-deal involving 12 countries in Asia, North America and Latin America involving hundreds of billions of dollars in trade. After unveiling her new economic plan on Thursday, she promised to ""ramp up enforcement"" of trade laws and to even appoint a ""chief trade prosecutor.""Criminalizing trade. Really?Economists largely agree that the world's incredible economic success after World War II and into this century was due to a global move toward freer trade, lower tariffs and bigger global markets. Today, sadly, both parties seem prepared to abandon that.This week, Hillary Clinton, sounding a lot like socialist candidate Bernie Sanders, has picked up where he left off in her anti-trade diatribes.""The answer is to finally make trade work for us, not against us, so my message to every worker ... across America is this: I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages, including the Trans Pacific Partnership. I oppose it now. I'll oppose it after the election. And I'll oppose it as president.""She promised to ""stand up to China and anyone else who tries to take advantage of American workers and companies,"" and said she would ""triple the number of enforcement officers, and when countries break the rules, we won't hesitate to impose targeted tariffs.""While this may be emotionally pleasing, it's economically dangerous. Despite free trade's growing unpopularity (see IBD/TIPP data, above), U.S. exports have risen from $1.026 trillion in 2006 to $1.503 trillion last year, a 46% gain. A tit-for-tat trade spat with our major partners would endanger those gains, which helped the U.S. economy off of the mat after the 2008 financial crisis.And such talk alarms our closest allies. As a headline on Friday in the British Express  said: ""Brussels In Crisis As Hillary Clinton Hints She Will KILL OFF Hated EU-US Trade Deal.""Those who think that's funny, please remember: In 1930 the Smoot-Hawley tariffs, a protectionist law that also had bipartisan support, set off a trade war that shrank the global market for U.S. goods and helped turn a recession into a Great Depression. Scapegoating trade is a big mistake. It won't lead to any more jobs, or to more goods made here. Just the opposite.
"
73,MAT,"The dueling economic visions pitched by Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in the Detroit area this week highlighted the stark difference in their ideas for addressing the weakest part of the recovery: slow capital investment.Trump's idea is to make the U.S. a more attractive place to do business by, first and foremost, cutting the federal corporate tax rate from 35%, the world's highest.Clinton's idea is to drive the economy with government-led investment in infrastructure -- roads, bridges, school buildings, water systems, universal broadband access and a modernized electric grid -- which she says is ""way overdue.""In her Thursday speech, Clinton said $25 billion in seed funding for infrastructure projects could attract $250 billion in private investment. (The implication is that private investors would recoup their investment and a decent return through future user fees.)Clinton would fund the government portion by closing tax loopholes for businesses, i.e. raising net business taxes. Bottom line: She wants a higher effective corporate tax rate.Trump recently tried to one-up Clinton, saying that he would invest between $800 billion and $1 trillion on infrastructure, but that he'd float government bonds to pay for the whole thing.Clinton, like budget watchdog groups, warned that Trump's spending promises and proposed tax cuts make for an untenable fiscal policy.In other words, Trump has avoided making choices, while Clinton has made a choice to put government alone in the driver's seat.Undoubtedly, there are huge questions about Trump's agenda. Moody's Analytics has said that his policies will reduce the number of U.S. jobs and economic output, largely because of his planned crackdown on immigration and tariffs on imports. Increased immigration under Clinton is a primary reason that the economy would expand under her policies, Moody's says.Yet Clinton's plan raises a question: What kind of economy will we have after the burst of government-led investment has peaked? Her idea is to keep business investment in the U.S. by imposing an ""exit tax"" for businesses that pick up and leave. She also spoke of making companies refund the cost of any federal, state or local tax benefit they received if they uproot U.S. jobs and move work offshore.While the devil -- and workability -- is in the details of such tax policies, the other side of the ""exit tax"" coin is that Clinton risks pulling away the welcome mat for foreign investment, while encouraging U.S. companies to build new operations elsewhere.Keeping -- or even hiking -- the effective corporate tax rate in combination with other Clinton policies (a federal minimum wage of $12 or more and paid family leave) would act as drags on investment. She doesn't think the U.S. has to compete for business, but the government's fiscal pressures will naturally limit its ability to drive growth.Her one-dimensional, pure liberal vision was perhaps best summed up by MSNBC reporter Benjy Sarlin in a tweet: ""Clinton's offer to Republicans on economic policy: Nothing. You get nothing.""

74,MAT,"The force was with Hasbro (HAS) as second-quarter earnings and revenue growth both topped analyst estimates, in large part on the toys associated with Walt Disney (DIS) films ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" and the still hugely popular ""Frozen."" But Hasbro shares fell Monday, perhaps amid concerns about sluggish boy toy sales. Hasbro's Q2 earnings per share shot up 24% to 41 cents on a 10.2% hike in revenue to $879 million. Wall Street was looking for 39 cents EPS and $859 million revenue. Earnings growth has beaten forecasts eight quarters in a row.Brian Goldner, Hasbro's chairman, president and CEO, said in a statement that growth in the second half will be driven largely by new products such as Furby Connect and Speak Out and support for Disney Lucasfilm's ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"", and trolls for DreamWorks Animation (DWA).In Q2, Revenue from partner Brands including Star Wars, Disney Princess and ""Frozen"" grew 15%.Girls' category sales increased 35% to $172.3 million on Disney Princesses and Disney's ""Frozen"" dolls, along with Baby Alive. But boys category revenue grew 4% to $355.1 million driven by gains in Nerf brand, along with Star Wars and the addition of the Yokai Watch.Jefferies said boy toy sales worried investors. The investment noted a slowdown in toy sales from ""Jurassic World,"" which was released in June 2015.Hasbro shares sank 6.6% to 79.82 on the stock market today, diving below its 50-day moving average and falling to a 3-month low. That undercuts the low of a flat-base consolidation on top of an April breakout from a six-month base.Walt Disney edged up 0.4% Monday to end the day at 100.15.

86,MAT,"As usual, everyone's talking about the rumored new iPhone. The wrinkle? They're not talking about the very next model, the iPhone 7 due out in September, but instead are looking out a distant 15 months or so ahead -- a lifetime in the tech world -- at the following iPhone.Next year's iPhone 8 is shaping up to be the most exciting smartphone release from Apple (AAPL) since the original iPhone in 2007.And for Apple that's good -- and bad.The buzz around the 2017 model iPhone is so great that it threatens to put a damper on sales of this year's model, analysts say. The iPhone 8 has been written about extensively in the tech and mainstream media, with journalists and analysts getting their information from leaks in the supply chain.""As more and more is written about the iPhone 8, the average consumer will start to become aware of what's coming from Apple,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Mike Walkley told IBD.People who have paid off their current iPhones ""might wait one more year for what they think is going to be a bigger release,"" timed with the 10-year anniversary of the first iPhone, Walkley said. ""Certainly everything in the supply chain points to next year having a much more differentiated device than this next one.""Apple observers expect the iPhone 7 will be a relatively minor upgrade to the current iPhone 6S series handsets. The 7 is expected to be thinner, faster and have a better camera, but nothing too earthshaking is seen. It will look pretty much like any iPhone from the past couple of years.By contrast, the iPhone 8 could sport a radical redesign thanks to its use of an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screen, instead of the current LCD screen.The iPhone 8 could make Apple's smartphone sexy again and prompt long lines to form outside Apple retail stores, like in the good old days.But rumors about the 8, which will be the 11th-generation iPhone, could inspire people to extend the life of their existing handsets and wait to upgrade, Wall Street analysts say. That could lead to soft sales of this fall's 10th-generation handset, the iPhone 7. And those soft sales would be on top of weaker-than-expected sales of the current iPhone 6S.One huge factor could alleviate much of this concern, though -- the way service providers are altering their business models.Apple and its carrier partners such as AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) probably will use the iPhone 7 launch to promote upgrade plans that let customers get new iPhones every year, says Tim Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies and a longtime Apple watcher.""More and more people are going to move to that, because everybody knows that Apple does a better phone every year,"" he said.Most of the excitement over the iPhone 8 concerns its rumored use of an edgeless OLED screen. OLED displays boast richer colors, deeper blacks and a faster refresh rate than LCD screens. Since OLED screens don't have a backlight, they can be much thinner and more power efficient. Plus, OLED displays are flexible, allowing them to be used on curved screens.Mock-ups of possible iPhone 8 designs circulated by tech enthusiast websites illustrate dramatic new form factors for the device. From iPhones with secondary screens along their sides to all-glass handsets in which the display covers the entire surface of the phone, front and back.For years, Apple Chief Design Officer Jony Ive has expressed a desire for the iPhone to appear like a single sheet of glass, the Wall Street Journal reported recently.But don't put a lot of stock into those artists' conceptions of the iPhone 8, Bajarin says.""The kinds of designs you're seeing now are more pie-in-the-sky than reality,"" he said.The iPhone 8 could be so fresh-looking that it could cause new-model envy among current iPhone users, something that hasn't happened since Apple moved to larger screen sizes in 2014.One big question is whether Apple will limit the OLED-screen iPhone 8 to a premium model and keep selling LCD models as well.Another is whether any use of a curved display or wraparound screen will be truly useful or perceived as a gimmick.Apple's OLED iPhone wouldn't be the first such smartphone on the market. Samsung already uses OLED displays in its flagship Galaxy smartphones. Samsung itself, in fact, is the top maker of OLED displays, including for its TV sets, and Apple likely would have to buy its OLED screens from Samsung until other vendors could ramp up production.Sharp, Japan Display, Joled, AU Optronics (AUO) and LG Display (LPL) all plan to add either pilot or production capacity for OLED screens in 2017 or 2018. Plus, at least five Chinese companies are preparing OLED production lines.Apple enthusiasts, however, will think the OLED iPhone is a ""big deal,"" even though Samsung and others already use them, says Roger Kay, an analyst with Endpoint Technologies Associates and another longtime Apple watcher.Roughly 10% of smartphones use OLED displays today, and that figure could reach 100% after 2020, Goldman Sachs said in a May 23 research report.But the OLED screen could be just one selling point of the iPhone 8. Another major change is that next year's iPhone could feature wireless charging, according to media reports. Instead of plugging in a power cord, users would place the device on a charging mat. Again, Samsung and some others, such as Motorola, already offer such a feature, but it would be another big change for the iPhone.In addition, Apple also could eliminate the physical home button with the iPhone 8. That functionality would be incorporated into the pressure-sensitive touch screen. Removing the home button would allow the display to cover more of the iPhone's front panel.For the iPhone 7, Apple is expected to eliminate the audio jack, forcing users to switch to a Bluetooth headset or a Lightning-connected headset. A rumor circulating at the Computex Taipei 2016 trade show claims that, with the iPhone 7, Apple plans to bundle a Lightning adapter with its standard EarPods headphones.With the removal of the audio jack in the iPhone 7 and wireless charging in the iPhone 8, Apple could then offer a smartphone with no holes to plug in chargers and cables. The device could be completely wire free and rely on the internet cloud for data backup.Apple shares fell 2.8% on the stock market today as Brexit fears hit worldwide.

87,MAT,"Hello Barbie says, ""Privacy breach"" to plaintiffs in a lawsuit that’s testing the boundaries of security in the Internet of Things age.Mattel (MAT), the maker of the interactive doll, is among those being sued on grounds that the doll picks up and records the voices of the children who play with the doll, voices that it uploads and stores without parental consent.The unusual case was filed in December in Los Angeles County Superior Court. Other defendants include San Francisco-based ToyTalk, which partnered with Mattel to produce the doll; and Los Angeles-based Samet Privacy, which does business as the kidSAFE Seal Program that lists, reviews and certifies interactive and online products as compliant with the federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA.“The problem is parents and children don’t really know that ToyTalk is going to use their child’s conversation for data mining and other purposes not fully disclosed,” said Steve Teppler of the Abbott Law Group in Jacksonville, Fla. “They say they’ll protect the child of the purchasing parent’s identity, but what about friends’ children?”Abbott Law Group represents the plaintiffs in the case: Ashley Archer-Hayes of Vista, Calif., who bought the doll, and her minor child; and Charity Johnson of Chula Vista, Calif., and her minor child “on behalf of all others similarly situated,” states the suit. The children of Johnson and Archer-Hayes are friends, and they played with Hello Barbie at a Barbie-themed birthday party late last year, the suit says.The suit is one of many dealing with the untapped online frontier that is the Internet of Things, referring to products used in everyday life that are increasingly connected with the Internet and that store information online. These products range from cars to home security systems.On its website, kidSAFE describes Hello Barbie as “the first fashion doll that can have a two-way conversation with girls. The doll features speech recognition and progressive learning features that enable girls to engage with Barbie like never before. Hello Barbie features more than 8,000 lines of dialogue, inspires imagination and storytelling, plays more than 20 interactive games, and tells jokes.”Although Hello Barbie must be registered to activate, and the registration process includes information relating to privacy, plaintiffs argue that Hello Barbie will pick up voices of a child’s friends, and those voices will be uploaded and stored without parental knowledge, let alone consent.Interactive toys like Hello Barbie are expected to proliferate. How can parents stay informed about the privacy policies of each toy?“That’s the problem,” Teppler said. “What are your choices? You could make the doll only perform with the registered user, but that’s not the way the toy is designed. To comply with COPPA, you’d have to have a waiver for the user of the child’s voice. We don’t know what ToyTalk’s affiliates do with this information.”Teppler raised the possibility that information stored on ToyTalk computers could become discoverable in litigation, for example, if kids start talking about their parents’ activities.“It’s an interesting evidentiary issue,” said Teppler. “The terms of service say the purchasing parents can access the recordings for two years, but can they get them erased? You could deactivate your account, but they would still have the recordings.”Mattel would not make someone available for an interview, but spokesman Alex Clark said in an email, “While we do not comment on pending litigation, I can tell you Mattel is committed to ensuring every product we make meets or exceeds all applicable laws and regulations. In addition, we are confident in the robust data security technology used in our Hello Barbie product.”For its part, kidSAFE has rated Hello Barbie as “COPPA certified.”Ben Warlick, an attorney with Morris, Manning and Martin in Atlanta, says that plaintiffs have an uphill battle to recovery because Mattel and other defendants don’t control how a child uses the toy.“Plaintiffs pointed out suggestions for what Mattel could have done, including notifying parents that the toy should not be used outside the presence of other nonregistered children,” Warlick said. “But I do not think it’s a realistic argument to tell a child not to play with a toy around other kids; that’s hard to do.”Warlick, who co-chairs his firm’s Internet of Things practice group, says that the Hello Barbie case is likely just one of the first of many that will test the bounds of privacy protection in the Internet of Things age.“We started the new practice group because we’re finding that universal notions of privacy and security don’t necessarily translate to the Internet of Things,” he said.Warlick says that an argument can be made that interactive devices should have higher security and encryption features, “but many little battery-powered devices like weather or pet monitors may not have the processing power to run encryption or robust security measures.”Similar suits have been filed against ADP home security systems and Vizio smart TV sets.“It’s a real issue for product developers in this area,” Warlick said, “about what is the right level of security and encryption for these devices.”

95,MAT," Radical Islam: The liberal former head of Britain’s top multiculturalism agency confesses he “got almost everything wrong” regarding Muslim assimilation and warns the West that Muslims create “nations within nations.” Oh now they tell us.Muslims have carved out no-go zones across Britain, as they have in France, which has also opened the floodgates to more Muslim immigrants. And now that those same immigrants have established some 85 Islamic courts dispensing shariah “justice” across the U.K., the former head of Britain’s Equalities and Human Rights Commission says perhaps he and other multiculturalists erred in assuming they would blend into western society and adopt our values.Trevor Phillips says it may have been a mistake to loosen immigration restrictions and roll out the prayer mat for large numbers of Islamists. And  he says that he was naive to think the real risk of the arrival of these foreign communities was discrimination against Muslims.“For a long time, I too thought that Europe’s Muslims would become like previous waves of migrants, gradually abandoning their ancestral ways, wearing their religious and cultural baggage lightly, and gradually blend into Britain’s diverse identity landscape,” he said. “I should have known better.""Phillips now says followers of Islam, in fact, hold very different values from the rest of society and many want to lead separate lives.“We’re heading in entirely the wrong direction,” he recently wrote. “So much so that some of them would rather live under a wholly different system.”But it may be too late. Like much of Eurabia, Londonstan is in a life-and-death struggle for the soul of Western civilization. A new survey of British Muslim attitudes reveals a growing cultural chasm:Belgium is also rethinking its multicultural policies, now being blamed for the creation of segregated Muslim enclaves that have become breeding grounds for terrorists.Belgian Interior Minister Jan Jambon says the tiny nation’s liberal integration policy has caused a “cancer” within Muslim communities, many of whom actually cheered in the streets after the deadly Brussels attacks last month.“A significant section of the Muslim community danced when the attacks took place,” Jambon revealed in an interview with a Belgian newspaper.""They threw stones and bottles at police and press during the arrest of (terrorist co-conspirator) Salah Abdeslam,” he added. ""That is the real problem. That migrants from the third or fourth generation turn openly against our society and have been willing to use violence or to justify it has to do with our policy.”Both Jambon and Phillips lamented that European politicians for years ignored the warning signs that Muslims were refusing to assimilate and held contempt for their western values.American pundits glibly say that this could never happen here, that our Muslim community is different — more westernized, better adjusted -- as if America has some magical assimilation machine that Eurabia lacks.Apparently these same gullible experts have never walked through Paterson, N.J.’s Little Ramallah district. Or Dearbornistan, Mich. Or Little Mogadishu, Minn. Or Northern Virginiastan. Or the countless other Muslim enclaves that will soon resemble Molenbeek and other European no-go zones, as Obama imports 1,500 Syrian refugees a month to the U.S., on top of the average of 1,250 Iraqi and 750 Somali refugees each month.Europeans have learned the hard way that it’s not just a tiny minority of these immigrants who hold dangerous views. Let’s not make the same mistake.

His relentless hustle and tenacity put an exclamation point on his playing days.Celtics: He helped lead the Boston Celtics back to prominence and titles after Bill Russell retired.Career: After 11 seasons in the National Basketball Association, he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.“What 6-foot-9 center Dave Cowens lacked in size he made up for with an aggressive desire to win,” wrote the Hall’s website.Cowens was never intimidated going up against much bigger titans such as Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bob Lanier.“The media always played up the fact that I was 6-9,” Cowens said. “I really didn’t think it was that big of a disadvantage to be my size. I think there were some advantages to my skill set that I brought to the game over guys that were taller and bigger than me.”Cowens leveraged his ability to average 17.6 points and 13.6 rebounds per game while playing from 1970 to 1983, with a two-season gap toward the end of his career. As a center operating from the outside, he shot a solid 46% from the field. The epitome of an unselfish player, he also averaged almost four assists a game, high for a center.Most important, Cowens spearheaded the Celtics to NBA titles in 1974 and 1976. In 89 playoff games, he averaged 18.9 points and 14.4 rebounds per game.“Dave wanted to be the best player that he could be, but he wanted to win,” said former teammate Paul Silas. “His attitude about the game and winning was just so great.”Cowens shares that mentality to people off the court: “Find something you really like to do, then do what you say you’re going to do and show up every day and work harder than anyone else. Those are qualities that you have to have if you ever hope to be successful.”Another former teammate, Jo Jo White, said: “The great thing about David was he was always ready to go when it was time to play. He brought a ready-set-go that was different than any other player I ever played with, and it rubbed off on his teammates. The intensity he brought had a lot to do with guys playing on another level when they played with him. He’d be on the floor, diving for loose balls. That was Dave.”Tom Heinsohn, who coached those 1974 and '76 champion Celtics, said: “Dave’s most outstanding trait was his desire. When he put his mind to something, 100% of him went with it. He could be a ferocious player. He was a very competitive person.”After his playing career, Cowens channeled that competitiveness to coach in the NBA, pushing the Charlotte Hornets to the 1997 and 1998 playoffs. He was also the last player-coach in the NBA, for the Celtics during the 1978-79 season.Born in Newport, Ky., Cowens lauds his parents for instilling in him a solid work ethic: give his full effort in whatever he undertook.Cowens played basketball in his freshman high school year, but a conflict with his coach caused him to quit the team. While skipping his sophomore season, he shot up to 6 foot 6, leading a new coach to convince him to rejoin the squad for his junior year.As a senior, Cowens led his team to a 29-3 record and drew a scholarship from Florida State University.At 190 pounds, Cowens made a decision after his freshman year at FSU to put some muscle behind his continued growth. “I decided to go against what everyone else was telling me to do and start lifting weights for my upper body,” he said.Weight training wasn’t recommended for basketball players then, as many thought it decreased flexibility, but Cowens felt he needed to be stronger to compete.It paid off. With Cowens averaging 19 points and 17 rebounds per game in college on 52% shooting, the Seminoles improve each of his three varsity years, going 23-3 in his senior season.The Celtics chose Cowens fourth overall in the 1970 NBA draft, impressed with his skills and dedication.Boston was amid a rebuilding process. The Celtics had just dipped to 34 wins in their first season after the Russell dynasty, and Cowens helped turn them around. His 17 points and 15 rebounds per game helped lift the 1970-71 Celtics to 44 wins. He was named co-NBA Rookie of the Year alongside the Portland Trail Blazers’ Geoff Petrie.Cowens was a vacuum for information, as he said in his Hall of Fame induction speech: “I’ve tried to learn from all the coaches and the teammates, not only how to improve as a player, but how to be a success as a person.”For the next five years, the Celtics -- with the nucleus of Cowens and fellow future Hall of Famers White and John Havlicek -- averaged 59 wins per season and captured those two NBA titles.“I thought he was a wild man,"" Silas told NBA.com about Cowens. ""I'd never seen anybody with that much talent play that aggressively.""That even extended to practice, Silas told IBD: “Dave would make sure that everybody was practicing the right way, running and playing hard.”Cowens was voted the NBA’s MVP for the 1972-73 season. He led the Celtics to a massive 68-14 record, tied for the second-most wins in NBA history at that time, while averaging 20.5 points and 16.2 rebounds per game.“I led through my example on the court; I really didn’t say too much,” Cowens said. “You play longer and harder than anyone else, and you push the envelope that way. By example, you show people they can do more than they think they can do. Anybody can say let’s do this, let’s do that. But to show it, that’s where I think the real leadership comes in.”The Celtics returned to the NBA Finals in 1974, meeting the Milwaukee Bucks, led by Abdul-Jabbar and Oscar Robertson. In Game 7, played in Milwaukee, Cowens came up big: 28 points and 14 rebounds as the Celtics bested the Bucks 102-87 for the crown.For Boston's 18 playoff games that spring, Cowens averaged 20.5 points, 13.3 rebounds and 3.7 assists per game.The Celtics were a forerunner of today’s NBA small ball, sans the three-point shot, which wasn’t part of the league. “Dave would run harder than almost any center in the league,” Silas said. “That was our game; we ran all the time.”The Celtics also played scrambling, hard-nosed defense, anchored by Cowens.“Dave was a tough, physical guy and used his body; he contested shots every time,” Silas said. “He was really tough. That was the reason he could play center at 6-9.”Said Cowens: “I always related playing the center position as being the captain of the defense. You’re helping your teammates on top of your own job. They follow your lead on the defensive end.”The Celtics returned to the Finals two years later, beating the Phoenix Suns in six games. In 18 playoff games that season, Cowens averaged 21 points, 16.4 rebounds (leading everyone), and 4.6 assists per game.It always comes back to putting the work in, he said: “You’ve got to be fundamentally sound and respond when that situation calls for you. That’s where the preparation comes in. You’ve got to be paying attention, you’ve got to be concentrating. You have to care.”Sparked the Boston Celtics to NBA titles in 1974 and 1976. Inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 1991.Overcame: Limited height at center.Lesson: You can’t measure heart.“To be a leader, you have to have a strong sense of self-assurance that you’re willing to do whatever it takes to win, and that you’re able to produce. People are going to follow that lead because this is what you’ve shown. You’ve led by example.”""I never thought of myself as a superstar. … I represent the working class of the NBA.”“You put the work in and learn what you can do. You learn how to get something done based on trial and error.”“Have a good read on how to approach people. When you’re on a team, you’ve got to have a certain disposition, know how to talk to people and address them.”“Give of your time and don’t forget the little guy.”

101,MAT,"Apple (AAPL) hasn't announced plans to join the virtual reality headset craze, but third-party hardware companies have designs on using the iPhone for VR products.Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster predicted Tuesday that third-party hardware firms would start selling VR products that use the iPhone as a display this fall. These devices would be much like the Samsung Gear VR headset, which uses Samsung smartphones as the display.IonVR, a privately held company specializing in third-party VR hardware, expects to have a headset in the fall that will will allow the iPhone to be used for VR and will cost between $100 and $200, Munster said.The iPhone already can be used with Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google Cardboard and Mattel’s (MAT) View-Master, but those aren't true VR experiences, he said.Virtual reality is much talked about as a hot new technology, and there are concerns that it could follow the boom and bust of 3D TV. Munster says that VR will not flop like 3D, in part because of the greater level of investment in VR and its cousin, augmented reality. Facebook (FB), which owns Oculus VR, is firmly committed to its success, he said.""On top of that, Apple, Google and Sony (SNE) are expected to all be making significant investments in VR/AR over the next five years,"" he said. ""We believe these investments will lay the groundwork for VR /AR becoming the next computing paradigm.""Sony is in one of the best positions to capitalize on VR, Munster said.“It has the content, distribution and user base (36 million PS4 consoles sold) to allow VR to grow rapidly,” Munster said. “We have also been impressed by Sony’s demos of ‘London Heist’ and ‘Walk The Wire,’ and the company has a slate of approximately 80 games which will be available at launch, which is expected late this year.”Oculus Rift is set to ship on March 28 in 20 countries, including the U.S. It will be available at select retailers in April. It will cost $599 and require a high-end PC with a graphics card. Bundles of the Oculus Rift headset and “Oculus-ready” PCs start at $1,499.Meanwhile, Samsung is promoting its smartphone-based Gear VR, which uses Oculus technology. Gear VR costs $99 and requires a newer Samsung Galaxy phone.Another VR headset, the HTC Vive, is due to go on sale April 5 and cost $799. Like the Oculus Rift, Vive requires a high-end PC with dedicated graphics processor. Vive is a collaboration between smartphone maker HTC and video game developer Valve.

""While it is in the early stages, we see the platform play as strategically smart, as it should enhance the value proposition for Adobe’s entire product suite, making it stickier with customers.""Adobe, which is on the IBD Big Cap 20 stock list, closed up 0.4% Thursday at 92.52, down 1% for the week.

120,MAT,"Look - the sharp selloff took out some key long-term support levels - the S&P breaking well below the August and September 2015 lows - solidifying the bearish trend while testing and breaching the October 2014 lows at 1820 sending that index as low as 1812.......  Yet on the other hand....the Dow and the Nasdaq did NOT break the August/September 2015 lows..... so perhaps this is what gave the BULL some new life - if even for a brief moment.... In the last hours of the day investors began buying  many of those broken down biotechnology companies - (covering their shorts) igniting a rally in the Nasdaq index - taking it briefly into positive territory....... suggesting the BULL may find some temporary relief......Honestly - there is absolutely no sign of a bottom just yet and for all of the pundits out there - there is no lack of opinion on where that bottom is either...  There is no sign of a bottom in global equities nor is there any sign of a bottom in oil prices.....other than we are oversold in both asset classes - which could lead to a swift but weak rally............Remember - when investors need to raise cash - where do they go?  The equity mkts!  Why?  Because they are liquid, tradable and accessible......investors can easily hit the SELL button and have the cash in their account at the end of day.....you can't do that in so many other asset classes - so when times get tough or investors get nervous - equities usually suffer the most............. And while the talking heads (gov't officials)  want us to believe that it's all good......investors will decide what the risk is worth and then price accordingly......But all of this action of late does raise a number of questions......Is all of this recent action really reflective of what is going on in the US?Mkts are in turmoil - yes.....but is it overdone, at all?  Is all this talk about  collapsing commodities really the reason for despair?  Is China really a reason for despair?  Will the multiyear breakdown in commodity prices ever be seen as a positive?  Lumber is down 19% from the June 2015 highs, Copper is down 30% from the May 2015 highs, Nickel is off 37%, Platinum is down 27%, Silver is down 15% and OIL is down some 80%  from the highs of  2008 ($147/barrel).....Shouldn't we be celebrating the fact that lower prices here should help stimulate a range of industries and global economies?  Look - the world is on sale at the moment.....and it may get a bit more uncomfortable - but let's not over react......The world is in transition.....as the World Economic Forum in Davos points out - we are in the midst of

122,MAT,"Full text of the Barack Obama State of the Union AddressMr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans: Tonight marks the eighth year I’ve come here to report on the State of the Union.  And for this final one, I’m going to try to make it shorter.  I know some of you are antsy to get back to Iowa.I also understand that because it’s an election season, expectations for what we’ll achieve this year are low.  Still, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the constructive approach you and the other leaders took at the end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for working families.  So I hope we can work together this year on bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform, and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse. We just might surprise the cynics again. (Scroll down for C-SPAN video of this speech.)But tonight, I want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead. Don’t worry, I’ve got plenty, from helping students learn to write computer code to personalizing medical treatments for patients.  And I’ll keep pushing for progress on the work that still needs doing.  Fixing a broken immigration system.  Protecting our kids from gun violence.  Equal pay for equal work, paid leave, raising the minimum wage.  All these things still matter to hardworking families; they are still the right thing to do; and I will not let up until they get done.But for my final address to this chamber, I don’t want to talk just about the next year.  I want to focus on the next five years, ten years, and beyond.I want to focus on our future.We live in a time of extraordinary change — change that’s reshaping the way we live, the way we work, our planet and our place in the world.  It’s change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs, but also economic disruptions that strain working families.  It promises education for girls in the most remote villages, but also connects terrorists plotting an ocean away.  It’s change that can broaden opportunity, or widen inequality.  And whether we like it or not, the pace of this change will only accelerate.America has been through big changes before — wars and depression, the influx of immigrants, workers fighting for a fair deal, and movements to expand civil rights.  Each time, there have been those who told us to fear the future; who claimed we could slam the brakes on change, promising to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control.And each time, we overcame those fears.  We did not, in the words of Lincoln, adhere to the “dogmas of the quiet past.”  Instead we thought anew, and acted anew.  We made change work for us, always extending America’s promise outward, to the next frontier, to more and more people.  And because we did — because we saw opportunity where others saw only peril — we emerged stronger and better than before.What was true then can be true now.  Our unique strengths as a nation — our optimism and work ethic, our spirit of discovery and innovation, our diversity and commitment to the rule of law — these things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come.In fact, it’s that spirit that made the progress of these past seven years possible.  It’s how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations.  It’s how we reformed our health care system, and reinvented our energy sector; how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops and veterans, and how we secured the freedom in every state to marry the person we love.But such progress is not inevitable.  It is the result of choices we make together.  And we face such choices right now.  Will we respond to the changes of our time with fear, turning inward as a nation, and turning against each other as a people?  Or will we face the future with confidence in who we are, what we stand for, and the incredible things we can do together?So let’s talk about the future, and four big questions that we as a country have to answer — regardless of who the next President is, or who controls the next Congress.First, how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy?Second, how do we make technology work for us, and not against us — especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change?Third, how do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman?And finally, how can we make our politics reflect what’s best in us, and not what’s worst?Let me start with the economy, and a basic fact: the United States of America, right now, has the........strongest, most durable economy in the world.  We’re in the middle of the longest streak of private-sector job creation in history.  More than 14 million new jobs; the strongest two years of job growth since the ‘90s; an unemployment rate cut in half. Our auto industry just had its best year ever.  Manufacturing has created nearly 900,000 new jobs in the past six years.  And we’ve done all this while cutting our deficits by almost three-quarters.Anyone claiming that America’s economy is in decline is peddling fiction.  What is true — and the reason that a lot of Americans feel anxious — is that the economy has been changing in profound ways, changes that started long before the Great Recession hit and haven’t let up. Today, technology doesn’t just replace jobs on the assembly line, but any job where work can be automated.  Companies in a global economy can locate anywhere, and face tougher competition.  As a result, workers have less leverage for a raise.  Companies have less loyalty to their communities.  And more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top.All these trends have squeezed workers, even when they have jobs; even when the economy is growing.  It’s made it harder for a hardworking family to pull itself out of poverty, harder for young people to start on their careers, and tougher for workers to retire when they want to.  And although none of these trends are unique to America, they do offend our uniquely American belief that everybody who works hard should get a fair shot.For the past seven years, our goal has been a growing economy that works better for everybody.  We’ve made progress.  But we need to make more.  And despite all the political arguments we’ve had these past few years, there are some areas where Americans broadly agree.We agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the education and training they need to land a good-paying job.  The bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start, and together, we’ve increased early childhood education, lifted high school graduation rates to new highs, and boosted graduates in fields like engineering.  In the coming years, we should build on that progress, by providing Pre-K for all, offering every student the hands-on computer science and math classes that make them job-ready on day one, and we should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids.And we have to make college affordable for every American. Because no......===============================================RELATED STORIES:Why won't Obama let Americans compete?In his final act, Obama makes Clint Eastwood's dayThe Obamas' $70 million vacation getaways you pay forLand mines along Hillary Clinton's path to the White HouseThe State Department's deceitful cover-up for Hillary===================================================........hardworking student should be stuck in the red. We've already reduced student loan payments to ten percent of a borrower's income. Now, we've actually got to cut the cost of college. Providing two years of community college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the best ways to do that, and I'm going to keep fighting to get that started this year.Of course, a great education isn’t all we need in this new economy. We also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security. After all, it’s not much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in America who are going to work the same job, in the same place, with a health and retirement package, for 30 years, are sitting in this chamber.For everyone else, especially folks in their forties and fifties, saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher.  Americans understand that at some point in their careers, they may have to retool and retrain.  But they shouldn’t lose what they’ve already worked so hard to build.That’s why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever; we shouldn’t weaken them, we should strengthen them.  And for Americans short of retirement, basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today.  That’s what the Affordable Care Act is all about.  It’s about filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when we lose a job, or go back to school, or start that new business, we’ll still have coverage.  Nearly eighteen million have gained coverage so far.  Health care inflation has slowed.  And our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law.Now, I’m guessing we won’t agree on health care anytime soon.  But there should be other ways both parties can improve economic security.  Say a hardworking American loses his job — we shouldn’t just make sure he can get unemployment insurance; we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that’s ready to hire him.  If that new job doesn’t pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills.  And even if he’s going from job to job, he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him.  That’s the way we make the new economy work better for everyone.I also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty. America is about giving everybody willing to work a hand up, and I’d welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support, like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers without kids.But there are other areas where it’s been more difficult to find agreement over the last seven years — namely what role the government should play in making sure the system’s not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations.  And here, the American people have a choice to make.I believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy. I think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed, and there’s red tape that needs to be cut. But after years of record corporate profits, working families won’t get more opportunity or bigger paychecks by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at the expense of everyone else; or by allowing attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered.Food Stamp recipients didn’t cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did.  Immigrants aren’t the reason wages haven’t gone up enough; those decisions are made in the boardrooms that too often put quarterly earnings over long-term returns.  It’s sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts.In this new economy, workers and start-ups and small businesses need more of a voice, not less.  The rules should work for them.  And this year I plan to lift up the many businesses who’ve figured out that doing right by their workers ends up being good for their shareholders, their customers, and their communities, so that we can spread those best practices across America.In fact, many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative.  This brings me to the second big question we have to answer as a country:  how do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges?Sixty years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didn’t deny Sputnik was up there.  We didn’t argue about the science, or shrink our research and development budget.  We built a space program almost overnight, and twelve years later, we were walking on the moon.That spirit of discovery is in our DNA.  We’re Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and George Washington Carver.  We’re Grace Hopper and Katherine Johnson and Sally Ride.  We’re every immigrant and entrepreneur from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley racing to shape a better world.  And over the past seven years, we’ve nurtured that spirit.We’ve protected an open internet, and taken bold new steps to get more students and low-income Americans online.  We’ve launched next-generation manufacturing hubs, and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day.But we can do so much more.  Last year, Vice President Biden said........====================================================Look, if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change, have at it. You’ll be pretty lonely, because you’ll be debating our military, most of America’s business leaders, the majority of the American people, almost the entire scientific community, and 200 nations around the world.=====================================================........that with a new moonshot, America can cure cancer.  Last month, he worked with this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health the strongest resources they’ve had in over a decade. Tonight, I’m announcing a new national effort to get it done.  And because he’s gone to the mat for all of us, on so many issues over the past forty years, I’m putting Joe in charge of Mission Control.  For the loved ones we’ve all lost, for the family we can still save, let’s make America the country that cures cancer once and for all.Medical research is critical.  We need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources. Look, if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change, have at it.  You’ll be pretty lonely, because you’ll be debating our military, most of America’s business leaders, the majority of the American people, almost the entire scientific community, and 200 nations around the world who agree it’s a problem and intend to solve it.But even if the planet wasn’t at stake; even if 2014 wasn’t the warmest year on record — until 2015 turned out even hotter — why would we want to pass up the chance for American businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future?Seven years ago, we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history.  Here are the results.  In fields from Iowa to Texas, wind power is now cheaper than dirtier, conventional power.  On rooftops from Arizona to New York, solar is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills, and employs more Americans than coal — in jobs that pay better than average. We’re taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy — something environmentalists and Tea Partiers have teamed up to support.  Meanwhile, we’ve cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly sixty percent, and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth.Gas under two bucks a gallon ain’t bad, either. Now we’ve got to accelerate the transition away from dirty energy. Rather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future — especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels.  That’s why I’m going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.  That way, we put money back into those communities and put tens of thousands of Americans to work building a 21st century transportation system.None of this will happen overnight, and yes, there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo.  But the jobs we’ll create, the money we’ll save, and the planet we’ll preserve — that’s the kind of future our kids and grandkids deserve.Climate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world. And that’s why the third big question we have to answer is how to keep America safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nation-build everywhere there’s a problem.I told you earlier all the talk of America’s economic decline is political hot air. Well, so is all........=====================================================

123,MAT,"We’ve got to accelerate the transition away from dirty energy. Rather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future — especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels. =====================================================........the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker.  The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth.  Period.  It’s not even close.  We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined.  Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world.  No nation dares to attack us or our allies because they know that’s the path to ruin.  Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected to this office, and when it comes to every important international issue, people of the world do not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead — they call us.As someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing, I know this is a dangerous time. But that’s not because of diminished American strength or some looming superpower. In today’s world, we’re threatened less by evil empires and more by failing states.The Middle East is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation, rooted in conflicts that date back millennia.  Economic headwinds blow from a Chinese economy in transition.  Even as their economy contracts, Russia is pouring resources to prop up Ukraine and Syria — states they see slipping away from their orbit.  And the international system we built after World War II is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality.It’s up to us to help remake that system.  And that means we have to set priorities.Priority number one is protecting the American people and going after terrorist networks.  Both al Qaeda and now ISIL pose a direct threat to our people, because in today’s world, even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life, including their own, can do a lot of damage.  They use the Internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country; they undermine our allies. But as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands.Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks and twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages pose an enormous danger to civilians and must be stopped.  But they do not threaten our national existence.  That’s the story ISIL wants to tell; that’s the kind of propaganda they use to recruit.We don’t need to build them up to show that we’re serious, nor do we need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that ISIL is representative of one of the world’s largest religions.  We just need to call them what they are — killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out, hunted down, and destroyed.That’s exactly what we are doing. For more than a year, America has led a coalition of more than 60 countries to cut off ISIL’s financing, disrupt their plots, stop the flow of terrorist fighters, and stamp out their vicious ideology. With nearly 10,000 air strikes, we are taking out their leadership, their oil, their training camps, and their weapons.  We are training, arming, and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria.If this Congress is serious about winning this war, and wants to send a message to our troops and the world, you should finally authorize the use of........===============================================Even without ISIL, instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world — in the Middle East, in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in parts of Central America, Africa and Asia. Some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks.===============================================........military force against ISIL.; Take a vote.  But the American people should know that with or without Congressional action, ISIL will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them.  If you doubt America’s commitment — or mine — to see that justice is done, ask Osama bin Laden.  Ask the leader of al Qaeda in Yemen, who was taken out last year, or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell.When you come after Americans, we go after you. It may take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limit. Our foreign policy must be focused on the threat from ISIL and al Qaeda, but it can’t stop there. For even without ISIL, instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world — in the Middle East, in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in parts of Central America, Africa and Asia.Some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks; others will fall victim to ethnic conflict, or famine, feeding the next wave of refugees. The world will look to us to help solve these problems, and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet bomb civilians.  That may work as a TV sound bite, but it doesn’t pass muster on the world stage.We also can’t try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis.  That’s not leadership; that’s a recipe for quagmire, spilling American blood and treasure that ultimately weakens us.  It’s the lesson of Vietnam, of Iraq — and we should have learned it by now.Fortunately, there’s a smarter approach, a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power. It says America will always act, alone if necessary, to protect our people and our allies; but on issues of global concern, we will mobilize the world to work with us, and make sure other countries pull their own weight. That’s our approach to conflicts like Syria, where we’re partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace.That’s how we forged a Trans-Pacific Partnership to open markets, protect workers and the environment, and advance American leadership in Asia.  It cuts 18,000 taxes on products Made in America, and supports more good jobs.  With TPP, China doesn’t set the rules in that region, we do.  You want to show our strength in this century? Approve this agreement.  Give us the tools to enforce it.Fifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy, setting us back in Latin America. That’s why we restored diplomatic relations, opened the door to travel and commerce, and positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the Cuban people.  You want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere?  Recognize that the Cold War is over.  Lift the embargo.American leadership in the 21st century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world — except when we kill terrorists; or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling.  Leadership means a wise application of military power, and rallying the world behind causes that are right.It means seeing our foreign assistance as part of our national security, not charity.When we lead nearly 200 nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change — that helps vulnerable countries, but it also protects our children.  When we help Ukraine defend its democracy, or Colombia resolve a decades-long war, that strengthens the international order we depend upon.When we help African countries feed their people and care for the sick, that prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores.  Right now, we are on track to end the scourge of HIV/AIDS, and we have the capacity to accomplish the same thing with malaria — something I’ll be pushing this Congress to fund this year.That’s strength.  That’s leadership.  And that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example.  That is why I will keep working to shut down the prison at Guantanamo:  it’s expensive, it’s unnecessary, and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies.That’s why we need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion.  This isn’t a matter of political correctness. It’s a matter of understanding what makes us strong.  The world respects us not just for our arsenal; it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith.  His Holiness, Pope Francis, told this body from the very spot I stand tonight that “to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place.”When politicians insult Muslims, when a mosque is vandalized, or a kid bullied, that doesn’t make us safer.  That’s not telling it like it is.  It’s just wrong.  It diminishes us in the eyes of the world.  It makes it harder to achieve our goals.  And it betrays who we are as a country.“We the People.”  Our Constitution begins with those three simple words, words we’ve come to recognize mean all the people, not just some; words that insist we rise and fall together.  That brings me to the fourth, and maybe the most important thing I want to say tonight.The future we want — opportunity and security for our families; a rising standard of living and a sustainable, peaceful planet for our kids — all that is within our reach.  But it will only happen if we work together. It will only happen if we can have rational, constructive debates.It will only happen if we fix our politics.A better politics doesn’t mean we have to agree on everything.  This is a big country, with different regions and attitudes and interests.  That’s one of our strengths, too.  Our Founders distributed power between states and branches of government, and expected us to argue, just as they did, over the size and shape of government, over commerce and foreign relations, over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security.But democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens.  It doesn’t work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice, or that our political opponents are unpatriotic.  Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise; or when even basic facts are contested, and we listen only to those who agree with us.  Our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get attention.Most of all, democracy breaks down when the average person feels........====================================================It’s one of the few regrets of my presidency — that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better.  There’s no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide.====================================================........their voice doesn’t matter; that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some narrow interest. Too many Americans feel that way right now.  It’s one of the few regrets of my presidency — that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better.  There’s no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide, and I guarantee I’ll keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office.But, my fellow Americans, this cannot be my task — or any President’s — alone.  There are a whole lot of folks in this chamber who would like to see more cooperation, a more elevated debate in Washington, but feel trapped by the demands of getting elected.  I know; you’ve told me.  And if we want a better politics, it’s not enough to just change a Congressman or a Senator or even a President; we have to change the system to reflect our better selves.We have to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters, and not the other way around.  We have to reduce the influence of money in our politics, so that a handful of families and hidden interests can’t bankroll our elections — and if our existing approach to campaign finance can’t pass muster in the courts, we need to work together to find a real solution.  We’ve got to make voting easier, not harder, and modernize it for the way we live now.  And over the course of this year, I intend to travel the country to push for reforms that do.But I can’t do these things on my own.  Changes in our political process — in not just who gets elected but how they get elected — that will only happen when the American people demand it.  It will depend on you.  That’s what’s meant by a government of, by, and for the people.What I’m asking for is hard.  It’s easier to be cynical; to accept that change isn’t possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don’t matter.  But if we give up now, then we forsake a better future.  Those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war, or allow another economic disaster, or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of Americans have fought, even died, to secure.As frustration grows, there will be voices urging us to fall back into tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who don’t look like us, or pray like us, or vote like we do, or share the same background.We can’t afford to go down that path.  It won’t deliver the economy we want, or the security we want, but most of all, it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world.So, my fellow Americans, whatever you may believe, whether you prefer one party or no party, our collective future depends on your willingness to uphold your obligations as a citizen.  To vote.  To speak out.  To stand up for others, especially the weak, especially the vulnerable, knowing that each of us is only here because somebody, somewhere, stood up for us.  To stay active in our public life so it reflects the goodness and decency and optimism that I see in the American people every single day.It won’t be easy.  Our brand of democracy is hard.  But I can promise that a year from now, when I no longer hold this office, I’ll be right there with you as a citizen — inspired by those voices of fairness and vision, of grit and good humor and kindness that have helped America travel so far.  Voices that help us see ourselves not first and foremost as black or white or Asian or Latino, not as gay or straight, immigrant or native born; not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans first, bound by a common creed. Voices Dr. King believed would have the final word — voices of unarmed truth and unconditional love.They’re out there, those voices.  They don’t get a lot of attention, nor do they seek it, but they are busy doing the work this country needs doing.I see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts to keep his company open, and the boss who pays him higher wages to keep him on board.I see it in the Dreamer who stays up late to finish her science project, and the teacher who comes in early because he knows she might someday cure a disease.see it in the American who served his time, and dreams of starting over — and the business owner who gives him that second chance.  The protester determined to prove that justice matters, and the young cop walking the beat, treating everybody with respect, doing the brave, quiet work of keeping us safe.I see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his brothers, the nurse who tends to him ‘til he can run a marathon, and the community that lines up to cheer him on.It’s the son who finds the courage to come out as who he is, and the father whose love for that son overrides everything he’s been taught.I see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as long as she has to; the new citizen who casts his for the first time; the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count, because each of them in different ways know how much that precious right is worth.That’s the America I know.  That’s the country we love. Clear-eyed. Big-hearted. Optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word. That’s what makes me so hopeful about our future. Because of you. I believe in you. That’s why I stand here confident that the State of our Union is strong. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. ####

124,MAT,"Immigration: Donald Trump got a standing ovation from some 20,000 supporters Monday after vowing to kick illegal alien gangsters out of the country. An alarming new Texas study on the MS-13 threat shows why.Conducted by the Texas Department of Public Safety, the study reveals that the nation's most violent street gang — MS-13 — has been energized by the flood of illegal immigrant minors entering the U.S. through Mexico, after President Obama rolled out the welcome mat for them.El Salvador-based MS-13 has now emerged as a ""top-tier"" threat in Texas, responsible for a rash of gruesome machete murders in Houston and other Texas cities.""In 2014, Texas experienced a dramatic spike in illegal aliens crossing into the United States from Mexico and Central America,"" the study warned.""Among those who illegally cross the Texas-Mexico border are gang members and associates, including those associated with large transnational gangs such as Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13).""The influx of illegal alien gang members crossing the border into Texas, along with reports of extremely violent murders committed by its members in the Houston area, positions the gang as one of the most significant gang threats in the state for this upcoming year. MS-13 gang members are known for highly violent crimes, including brutal murders and dismemberments.""The 57-page report says that some of the illegal immigrant murderers are teens as young as 14. Many of these juveniles, who have killed U.S. citizens, illegally crossed into the U.S. last year when Obama loosened border restrictions. Little wonder, then, that Texans went bonkers for Trump's anti-immigrant gang message at the American Airlines Center in Dallas.The GOP front-runner decried ""anchor babies"" and gang members among the immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, drawing huge ovations from the crowd.""You look at crime in so many different places, and you see gangs. Many of these gang members are illegal immigrants. They're rough dudes. They will be out of here so freaking fast!"" Trump promised to wild cheering and clapping.""You people are suffering,"" Trump told the Texans. ""I'm in New York, but they're in New York, too. They're all over the place.""He's right. The threat from ruthless foreign gangs has become a national concern. Separate reports reveal that MS-13 is consolidating power in Los Angeles neighborhoods and even taking over high schools in the wealthy suburbs around Washington, D.C.With the spread of ""maras"" gang violence, it's not surprising that a just-released CNN poll shows illegal immigration as the defining issue of the presidential race.Almost 90% of Americans say that stopping immigrants from entering the U.S. illegally should be a top government priority, while 52% favor building a Trump-style wall on the Mexican border. That's up from 45% in 2006, CNN reported.Under Democrats, the U.S. has become a dumping ground for violent criminals from Mexico and Central America. Trump's popularity signals that voters are fed up with it.

125,MAT,"Immigration: In the coverage of the ""humanitarian crisis"" of hundreds of thousands of Syrian ""refugees"" flooding Europe's shores, no one in the mainstream media has described them as Muslim. Does it matter? Absolutely.Senate Democrats are calling on the White House to allow at least 65,000 of the fleeing immigrants to settle inside the U.S.An estimated 4 million have fled Syria since 2011, when the country spiraled into civil war and President Obama's missteps fueled the chaos. America already has accepted 1,243 of them this year.Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina on Sunday argued against Washington taking in more Syrian nationals.We applaud her stand. It's a tough one to take against the heartbreaking photos of children dying while trying to relocate and against fellow Republicans, like Ohio Gov. John Kasich, claiming that the U.S. has ""a responsibility in terms of taking in some more folks.""Fiorina smartly cautions that we have to weigh national security issues against humanitarian concerns. The former Hewlett-Packard chief executive argued that agents from the Islamic State and other Mideast terror groups could easily slip through security.""I think the United States, honestly, sadly, cannot relax our entrance criteria,"" Fiorina said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" The U.S. should be ""very careful about who we let enter this country from these war-torn regions to ensure that terrorists are not coming here.""While the White House insists each refugee case is carefully vetted before applicants are allowed into the U.S., FBI officials say that's just not happening.Senior officials recently testified that they have no idea who the Iraqis and Syrians we're letting in are, and they can't find out what type of backgrounds they have — criminal, terrorist or otherwise — because no vetting opportunities exist in those war-shattered countries.Iraq and Syria, along with Somalia, are now failed states where police records aren't even kept.Agents can't vet somebody if they don't have documentation — and don't even have the criminal databases to screen applicants.So we in fact are not vetting these Muslim refugees. And it's a huge gamble to let people from hostile nations enter America without any meaningful background check. It's a safer bet just to limit, if not stop, their immigration.Several Iraqi refugees we let in the country have already been busted raising money for al-Qaida. And with Syria-based ISIS plotting to use immigration to export terrorists to the West, we'd be fools to copy Germany, France or Britain, and just roll out the welcome mat.Some of the refugees in Hungary have already made terrorist noises and ""beheading"" gestures to the cameras. Others have chanted ""Allahu Akbar"" and ""f**k you"" as they've engaged police in battle. A few have even thrown bottles and feces.These aren't the Vietnamese boat people. These are potential jihadists. And even the ones who aren't threats don't assimilate. They create Islamic enclaves that turn into no-go zones.Now they will have the numbers in Eurabia to create no-go cities. Terror-scarred France, for one, already regrets lax immigration from North Africa.Even Jordan and Lebanon have closed their borders to the refugees over terror fears.There are two ways Islamofascists plan to conquer America — one by violent jihad, the other by mass immigration, or al-hijrah. Little wonder the terror-tied Council on American-Islamic Relations just held a news conference at the National Press Club demanding that Obama ""open America's borders"" to Syrian Muslims.CAIR's leaders have been recorded by journalists in the past stating that they want to see America turned into an Islamic state and the Constitution replaced by the Quran as the law of the land. Mass immigration — or more accurately, invasion — is their weapon.What's the answer? Instead of importing an adversarial culture, Republicans must demand that the administration coax oil-rich Arab counties like Saudi Arabia to take in the Syrian refugees.

145,MAT,"Politics: Skirting Congress once again, President Obama seeks to admit another 100,000 foreigners to work here when jobs are few and labor-market participation is low. Whatever this is, it's not in the interest of U.S. workers.This time, the president isn't seeking to flood the country with tens of thousands of indigent, border-surging migrants in search of bigger benefits packages.Instead, he plans to award via executive order work permits to 100,000 foreign college grads (including deportable aliens) to compete with U.S. workers for jobs.Cui bono? Certainly not the U.S. workers he purports to champion.Obama's Homeland Security rule, published in the Federal Register on Thursday, amounts to yet another illegal power grab by explicitly treading on Congress' constitutional prerogative to set immigration quotas.It also comes at a time when 94 million U.S. workers have been unemployed so long they're no longer counted in labor-participation statistics. Some New Year's Day present for millions of discouraged Americans.The move is especially nefarious not just because it stands as another example of executive overreach but also because foreign workers already have U.S. workers at a disadvantage.For one thing, they're able to work cheaper. Unlike Americans, most have had free tuition rides from their sponsoring countries and carry no student loan debt. This enables them to tolerate lower wages than American grads saddled with high loan costs that can't be shirked even in bankruptcy court.The foreigners are also exempt from ObamaCare rules that can add as much as $20,000 in costs per domestic worker for employers struggling to compete in the low-growth economy that Obama has overseen.In short, Obama's move to bring in highly educated foreign labor hurts U.S. white-collar workers as much as the border surge undermined blue-collar workers.Which raises the question of what the president really has in mind.It may simply be a failure of strategy, the lack of a capacity to think three steps ahead.But more likely, it's the result of a European Union-style effort to change the face of America — rendering its cultural norms null amid the left's moral relativism through the import of chaotic newcomers from around the world.Indeed, Sweden, once known as perhaps the most generous recipient of foreign migrants, has recently found the cost too high. It's rolling up the welcome mat, discouraging further migration and cutting back welfare.Obama still seems to cling to the EU's illusion and the plan to dilute American culture. It won't work the way he thinks it will. Outsourcing American jobs, even inside the country, is no more attractive than outsourcing them abroad.

191,MAT,"Integrity: An undercover operation shows how ridiculously easy it is to defraud ObamaCare. Even after officials learned investigators had set up several bogus accounts in June of last year, they failed to catch any of them.The Government Accountability Office report reads like something out of the Onion — that comical fake news site. Except this isn't funny.A dozen undercover auditors tried to enroll in ObamaCare using fake Social Security numbers, phony IDs and bogus citizenship papers.The auditors should have been an easy catch, since ObamaCare had promised to build a ""data hub"" that would instantly check such information against records at the IRS, INS, Social Security and Homeland Security.Instead, 11 of the 12 got their coverage, along with hundreds of thousands of dollars in improper subsidies.This tragic comedy of errors went on for 16 months. For example, when the Healthcare.gov exchange later asked the undercover ""enrollees"" to submit supporting documents, they replied with counterfeits, if they replied at all. Yet none of them lost their coverage.In one case, the investigator sent zero documents in response to that request, then called the exchange to ask about his status and was told, ""Your application status is complete.""The GAO even made its undercover operation public in June 2014 and ""shared details of our work with CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency in charge of ObamaCare) during the course of our testing.""Yet for the next 10 months, not one of these bogus enrollees was caught. In fact, the ObamaCare exchange automatically re-enrolled all 11 of them this year and in several cases boosted their subsidy payments.After the initial report came out, CMS claimed, ""The marketplace has several layers of safeguards in place to verify consumer data, including requiring consumers to submit accurate information to qualify for health coverage,"" and promised, ""We are examining this report carefully and will work with GAO to identify additional strategies to strengthen our verification processes.""That promise was a farce.CMS admits that its contractors aren't required to detect fraud and aren't equipped to do so. Plus, it turns out that some time last year, CMS ""waived certain document filings requirements.""So if applicants sent anything in, even if it wasn't what they'd been asked for, ""it would be deemed sufficient,"" and they could keep their ObamaCare plans, according to the GAO. The auditors suspect that at least a few of the fake enrollees maintained their coverage because of this lowered standard.CMS also admitted that it's trying to balance the ""efficiency"" of the enrollment process with ""program integrity."" But the GAO investigation makes it clear that the Obama administration could hardly care less about program integrity, since cleaning up ObamaCare rolls would result only in cutting down the all-important enrollment numbers.Incredibly, CMS claimed that there has been ""no indication of a meaningful level of fraud.""Well, when you're actively not looking for it, you aren't likely to find it.CMS also told the auditors that there's little reason for anyone to defraud ObamaCare, since the subsidy checks go to the insurers, not the enrollees. This claim overlooks the obvious fact that someone enrolling under false pretenses — say, an illegal alien — can get heavily subsidized health insurance.These subsidies, mind you, are supposed to cost $28 billion this year alone, and top $100 billion a year within a decade. At that scale, even if only a small share of ObamaCare enrollees aren't U.S. citizens or aren't eligible for some other reason, the taxpayer hit will be enormous.The public already hates ObamaCare. When it learns that the Obama administration has practically put the welcome mat out for fraud, the Democrats' health care overhaul is going to be even less popular.

207,MAT,"Crisis: At 60 million and rising, the global refugee population has never been larger. But instead of blaming the states that take in the refugees, isn't it time to demand accountability of the nations that create their misery?The U.N. refugee agency's ""Global Trends Report: World at War"" got virtually no press when it was released Thursday, but it should have. Its stark data signal a global crisis of refugees and a great wrong in the established world order.Fifty-nine-and-a-half million people were driven from their homes in 2014 as a result of war, conflict and persecution, the highest number in history, as well as the biggest leap in a single year. A decade ago, refugees totaled 37.5 million. An average 42,500 are displaced each day, 1 out of every 122 people on earth, or, if placed together, a nation that ranks 24th among world populations.""We are witnessing a paradigm change, an unchecked slide into an era in which the scale of global forced displacement as well as the response required is now clearly dwarfing anything seen before,"" said U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres.Guterres rightly sees the scope of the problem, and as a global bureaucrat can be forgiven for his concern about ""the response required."" But that focus on the response is precisely why the crummy Third World dictatorships, terrorist groups and corrupted democracies that create the refugees keep getting away with it.Where is the scorn for the nations whose anti-free market, oligarchical and hostility-to-minority policies are the root of the problem?It seems that the only criticism and attention that ever comes to refugee issues centers on whether the countries are able to take them in. Southern Europe, for example, is being browbeaten by the U.N., the Vatican and the European Union for not rolling out the welcome mat for the thousands of smugglers' boats full of refugees from Syria, Niger, Chad, Libya, Afghanistan and elsewhere fleeing to their shores.The same can be said of the United States, which is watching a stop-and-go border surge of Central Americans who insist they're escaping gang violence in their home countries.Australian and Southeast Asian states have been berated by the same actors for not wanting to take in thousands of refugees sailing from Bangladesh and Burma. The Dominican Republic is taking global brickbats for trying to preserve the integrity of its borders.Are there any war-crimes tribunals in the works for captured Islamic State members whose terror is the No. 1 reason for refugee flight? Where's the criticism of the government of Afghanistan, which makes corruption the priority over a livable homeland?How about the governments of Chad, Niger and Somalia, or the leftist regimes in Central America, that actually encourage refugee outflows so they can live off their remittances instead of developing their economies through free markets?Are any of these places being kicked out of international organizations for the misery they are responsible for? Has anyone ever been singled out for their failure to make their states livable? Not one.Colombia was a creator of refugees a decade ago, but no longer. Why? It put itself under the wing of the U.S. through Plan Colombia in 1998 and learned how to take control of its country and initiate free-market reforms.Which brings up one idea that isn't being discussed amid so much wretchedness: empire. In a 2014 article in the Atlantic Monthly, geography expert Robert D. Kaplan pointed out that empires are the foremost creators of stability and protectors of minorities.The topic is taboo. But in light of the growing failures of the international community to halt the refugee problem, it belongs on the table just as much as the U.N.'s solution — throwing more money at it. With global refugees on the rise, it's time to talk about the cause of the crisis as well as the cure.

208,MAT," No. 1 online retailer Amazon.com (AMZN) drew more than a third of Americans' Black Friday and Cyber Monday e-commerce spending by one estimate, while a Wednesday tally called Cyber Monday the heaviest U.S. online spending day in history.Amazon, however, actually appears to have lost a little Cyber Monday market share.Official numbers aren't in from Amazon yet on holiday sales, but by analytics firm Slice Intelligence's tally, Amazon accounted for 35.7% of e-commerce spending on Black Friday, Nov. 27, followed by Best Buy (BBY) with 8.2%, Macy's (M) with 3.4%, and Wal-Mart (WMT) at 3.3%.Amazon's Black Friday share was way up from 31.5% last year in the tally, and Slice estimated that Amazon Black Friday sales rose 23.2% from a year ago.Slice spokeswoman Jaimee Minney told IBD that Cyber Monday ""was bigger than Black Friday and bigger than Cyber Monday last year.""The Black Friday estimate comes primarily from an analysis of about 876,000 email receipts provided by Slice's panel of 3 million shoppers.Amazon garnered a 36.1% share of U.S. e-commerce sales on Cyber Monday by Slice's estimate, down 2.7 percentage points from a year earlier.Also by its estimate, ""the retailer's sales were down 1.3% vs. the same day last year,"" Minney said in an email.Wal-Mart was the only store in the top five to gain share on Cyber Monday by that tally — up half a percentage point, to 3.8%.Cyber Monday SoarsWednesday, online tracker comScore said Cyber Monday reached $3.12 billion in online spending, up 21% from last year's Cyber Monday.ComScore's mobile figures aren't final, but it said desktop online spending set a record, at $2.28 billion.ComScore said that for the first 30 days of the holiday season, $27.9 billion has been spent online by desktops, up 6% from a year ago.""The weekend after Thanksgiving also reached a major milestone as it saw its first ever billion-dollar online shopping day on Sunday,"" it said in a report Wednesday, ""while Saturday sales reached the $1 billion mark for a second year in a row.""Overall, Cyber Monday online sales set a record with $3.07 billion in spending across the U.S., up 16% from last year, according to Adobe Systems' (ADBE) Adobe Index, as Amazon leveraged its e-commerce dominance. But Thanksgiving weekend sales looked weak at brick-and-mortar retailers.Apple (AAPL) iPad and iPhone doorbusters were hits for Target (TGT) and others, while Wal-Mart announced booming mobile sales.Retail analytics provider ShopperTrak, however, estimates that U.S. physical stores took in 10.4% less than a year earlier over Thanksgiving, Black Friday and the weekend — an estimated $20.4 billion that does not include Cyber Monday.Amazon's Black Friday showing wouldn't be out of line with the IBD Leaderboard company's heft in online shopping — the company ""makes up about 69% of total U.S. retail traffic,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham said in a research report this week. Minney said Amazon's Black Friday crowd ""doesn't surprise us.""Amazon said that it had a record Thanksgiving weekend for selling Amazon devices, triple last year's result. Its top-selling products across all those available on Amazon.com on Black Friday were Amazon devices, the company said — No. 1 was Fire (its tablet line), and No. 2 was the Fire TV stick for streaming video online.Where People Shop OnlineIn October, the latest month tallied, Amazon drew over 160 million online visitors, up 19% from a year ago according to comScore (SCOR) and Canaccord estimates. Next-up eBay (EBAY) drew about 88 million (up 12%), Wal-Mart 84 million (up 32%) and Target almost 69 million (up 15%).Amazon's rise was ""meaningfully fast,"" Canaccord analyst Graham said in a research note Tuesday.Graham noted that Amazon stock is the best-performing name in his coverage area and has more than doubled this year.Follow Donna Howell on Twitter @IBD_DHowell.RELATED VIDEO:Shopping Surges Online: What's Hot, What Flopped?

"
355,MAT,"Yemen: Iran and Saudi Arabia are spoiling for war in the country the Obama administration not long ago touted as an illustration of its successful policies. The Mideast minus U.S. power equals mass bloodshed.In the summer of 2007, first-term Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois greatly enhanced his media-perceived gravitas with what was hailed as a weighty article in Foreign Affairs magazine.Its title was ""Renewing American Leadership."" But it is its subtitle that is painfully ironic today: ""Common Security for our Common Humanity.""The notion of ""national security"" was to be rendered obsolete by an enlightened vision of the U.S. finally working as equals with the rest of the world.""If we act with boldness and foresight, we will be able to tell our grandchildren that this was the time when we helped forge peace in the Middle East,"" Obama wrote.How's that going for you, Mr. President? Six years of ""Common Security"" substituting for assertive American power isn't forging peace; it is detonating war.Something unthinkable, the Islamic State — a government that sends out slickly produced videotapes of beheadings and incinerations — emerged in a country that was on the right track pre-Obama (Iraq), and another whose evil was mostly contained and stable (Syria).It is only a matter of time before IS violence comes to the West, as it has threatened. But IS is only one of the new U.S. foreign policy's many Mideast disasters.The ""New Beginning"" the president traveled to Cairo to announce during his first year in office, groveling apologetically before Islamists, was a welcome mat for destabilization. The misnamed ""Arab Spring"" that followed overturned governments in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia and Yemen; encouraged rebellions in Bahrain and Syria; and led to sizable protests in Algeria, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and many other Mideast Muslim countries.Egypt was only saved by its popular army showing the door to the radical Muslim Brotherhood puppet who took over from our longtime ally, President Hosni Mubarak. And it remains a long-term question mark.But this week we have Shiite Iran sending a destroyer and another ship Wednesday near to Yemen as neighboring Sunni Saudi Arabia bombs the Iran-backed Houthi rebels who have gained power in the country.In less than three weeks, more than 500 have been killed there and some 1,500 injured, with more casualties sure to follow.Will we soon have a full-blown Iranian-Saudi war?Remarkably, only last September the president was touting Yemen as a success story: ""This strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us, while supporting partners on the front lines,"" he said, outlining his incrementalist plans against IS, ""is one that we have successfully pursued in Yemen and Somalia for years.""Obama ended two wars prematurely, in Iraq and Afghanistan (where the Taliban is poised to regain power). He now faces at least two new, unexpected wars involving multiple countries.What do we tell our grandchildren now, Mr. President?

"
367,MAT,"First of all, the Republican race will be a barroom brawl once it gets going. Right now, the numerous candidates are organizing their teams and policy lines and maneuvering for donors. Dollars are votes for the next several months. So, they're not going after each other yet in any but the most subtle ways. While no one has officially announced, those claiming to be ""considering"" a run are trying out their arguments and applause lines. Think of these days as spring training, despite the frigid temperatures of climate change.With Hillary Clinton, who couldn't win the Democrat nomination in 2008, still deciding when to begin her ""campaign"" for coronation as the party's 2016 nominee, Republicans once again will draw the most attention for their spirited primaries and caucuses.The weekend's Conservative Political Action Conference provided a peek into the personalities and themes of the GOP's nascent struggle to avoid losing three consecutive presidential campaigns, which the party hasn't experienced since 1940.Themes: Moderate is out. Conservative is in. Washington is bad. Flyover country is good. Hillary will have to work harder than she thinks to separate herself from what's-his-name on the golf course. Plus she's got some overweight baggage of her own to check, starting with Benghazi, fomenting the ill-considered Libyan war and disastrous fallout and, as always with the Clintons, taking in tons of money from anyone. They're not dead broke, by the way.Polls, especially straw polls, are totally meaningless at this point, beyond name recognition. Rand Paul won the CPAC Straw Poll again, but by considerably less than the previous two years. Scott Walker's bounce out of Iowa's Freedom Summit took him within about four points of winning. He was followed by Ted Cruz, Ben Carson and Jeb Bush. Chris Christie was tenth behind even Carly Fiornia.Here are some subjective impressions drawn from a few years' experience pol-watching:It was wise for John Boehner and Mitch McConnell to skip this year's sessions. They drew almost as much criticism as Democrats for not yet going to the mat over halting Obama's illegal illegal alien ploys.Despite the anti-Washington, anti-Congress fervor, Senators Cruz and Paul plow ahead with their efforts. The lazy D.C. media will go to Capitol Hill for stories much more often than Madison or Austin, skewing impressions of the horse race. Cruz' and Paul's fans are intense, vocal and dedicated. Cruz is a compelling speaker, strolling the stage without notes, excoriating RINOs and calling for a clear conservative revolution.But the fifth or sixth time you hear him speak, his laugh and applause lines sound too practiced, rehearsed. Maybe he didn't bus in as many supporters as Paul or Bush, but the CPAC Cruz crowd was nowhere near as enthusiastic as last year.Paul is a ready critic of Clinton: ""It's time for her to retire permanently."" But his weak speaking voice is distracting and he's going to have serious problems with Republicans who still believe in a strong national defense and foreign posture.As it did picking Cleveland for its convention site for the first time since 1924, the GOP seems on the hunt not for doctors but for genuine executives, men and a woman who've done real stuff. Fresh faces. New claims. Evidence of accomplishments beyond calling for things or introducing legislation.After 2,233 days of Obama, have Americans perhaps had enough with first-term legislators who talk good?A desire for doers puts the spotlight on governors--Walker, Rick Perry, Bush and Bobby Jindal. And Fiorina, who ran Hewlett Packard successfully and took on Dem Barbara ""Don't Call Me Ma'am"" Boxer in a familiar losing scenario for California Republicans.Watch Fiorina. Her story (one-time secretary to high-powered CEO) is compelling. Her rhetoric is fresh and pointed. ""Women are not a special interest group. We are now the majority!"" On Hillary: ""She tweets about equal rights for women but takes millions from foreign governments that deny women the most basic rights.""Walker is riding a wave now, which will help with name recognition and donors. He's got a long list of conservative accomplishments that worked in blue-collar Milwaukee County and are working in a blue state. But front-runner is a dangerous position this far out. Ask Rudy Giuliani.It's like being the flag-carrier in those charges across Civil War battlefields. Already after a lengthy investigation like was never made of Obama, the Washington Post has revealed that Walker, who's won three statewide elections in five years, is a few credits shy of a college degree. If you can believe such a thing.Perry and Jindal too have a long list of balanced budgets, job creations, tort reforms and other conservative mile-markers. Perry's also well-positioned on border security. But will they have the money?Bush will have the money, everyone expects. He's got baggage from his support of Common Core support and immigration reform. But Sean Hannity's vigorous on-stage questioning gave Bush an enlightening chance to outline some conservative accomplishments, including statewide school vouchers and cutting government payrolls.Bush is a superb retail campaigner. But he'll have to explain that and more over and over. And playing skilled defense denies him time to talk future. Are enough primary voters willing to listen to another Bush?Amb. John Bolton is probably the most-informed and best-spoken on foreign policy, shaping up as an uncharacteristically important component of the next presidential election, given Obama's damaging blunders and Americans' simmering fears.Also, Dr. Ben Carson is a nice guy and Donald Trump is a joke.RELATED:Obama gives 2 speeches to fight terrorismObama's confused again about who ended the Iraq warObama vows tough sanctions on Iran, but few believe him anymore

380,MAT,"Wireless charging of mobile devices has been slow to take off, but Apple's (AAPL) upcoming smartwatch could change that.Market research firm IHS (IHS) says global sales of wireless power receivers and transmitters in wearable applications will surge to $481 million in 2015, up from $14.5 million last year. The release this spring of the Apple Watch will spur the market, IHS predicted in a recent report.The market for wireless power and charging in wearables could approach $1.2 billion in 2019, IHS said.""Growth this year will be remarkable for wireless charging in wearable electronic devices, even if in reality the overall penetration of wireless charging into wearables is relatively low given the billions of wearables that are shipped into the consumer market every year,"" IHS analyst Vicky Yussuff said in a statement. ""Still, interest in the use of wireless charging remains high on the part of wearable technology providers and device original equipment manufacturers. As a result, penetration is expected to escalate rapidly over the next five years.""The Apple Watch could account for more than 70% of revenue this year from wireless charging-enabled wearable devices, IHS said.Apple's smartwatch will use the company's proprietary MagSafe inductive charging technology. With this system, the smartwatch is tethered to the charger and held in place by a magnet.Other wireless charging technologies today typically consist of a pad or mat on which consumers place an enabled device for charging. This method is often called ""drop and charge.""But new technologies will give users greater freedom on where they can charge their devices. These include wireless charging through surfaces like a desk and wireless charging over distances.By the end of 2017, shipments of wearable-technology wireless charging receivers that allow charging over distances will overtake inductive or tightly coupled solutions, IHS predicts.The wireless charging market is in its infancy, Yussuff told IBD. Companies angling for a share of the market include wireless technology licensors and semiconductor and component suppliers for wireless power transmitters/receivers, she said.Licensors in the market include WiTricity, Powermat Technologies, ConvenientPower, PowerbyProxi and Energous (WATT).Chip and component suppliers include Freescale Semiconductor (FSL), Integrated Device Technology (IDTI), Mediatek, Texas Instruments (TXN), Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (BRCM) and TDK.Wireless charging also is starting to take off in the mobile phone market.Samsung's next-generation flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S6, might debut with built-in wireless charging when it is announced in March, Dougherty analyst Charles Anderson said in a report Wednesday. If this happens, IDT has good odds of being the supplier, he said. Also in the running are TI, Broadcom and On Semiconductor (ONNN).""The highest-profile smartphone to date using wireless charging has been the LG G3, which split the socket between IDTI and TI based on geography,"" Anderson said. ""Our sense is that Broadcom's focus is wearables as opposed to smartphones at the moment. On Semi's competitive position is mostly unknown at this point other than the reference design with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 SoC.""The Samsung Galaxy S6 wireless charging business could be worth $112.5 million to $135 million annually, assuming Samsung sells at least 45 million of the handsets in 2015, he said. Anderson estimates wireless charging chip revenue per phone would be $2.50 to $3 ($1 for the receiver and $1.50 to $2 for the transmitter).RELATED:Apple Watch has no peer at CES 2015, analyst says.

421,MAT,"Samuel Slater got his start as an entrepreneur by being a mole.At 21, he was a frustrated mechanical genius who had spent 11 years in an English textile factory, and he wanted to go out on his own.But the industry was overcrowded, and he didn't know anyone who would give him startup money.Then he read a newspaper ad offering 100 British pounds (equivalent to $17,000 today) to anyone who would reveal the secrets of textile manufacturing to Americans.The British government forbade anyone with extensive experience in the industry from leaving the country. Punishment added up to a fine of twice that amount, 12 years in prison, or even death.Slater took his chances.He memorized every aspect of how the machines worked, disguised himself as a farm hand and sailed to America in 1789.With Slater leading the way, the American Industrial Revolution was soon rolling.By the time of his death in 1835, Salter had a net worth of $1.2 million ($27 million in today's money).As a percentage of gross domestic product, that places him 84th on the list of U.S. business titans, according to Michael Klepper and Robert Gunther in ""The Wealthy 100.""British StartSlater was born in 1768, the fifth son among eight children in a prosperous farming family in Belper, in the English midlands.He received a good education, excelled at math and showed mechanical aptitude.At 10, he began working for Jedediah Strutt, the partner in a cotton mill with Richard Arkwright, inventor of a water-powered spinning frame that made a worker 10 times more productive than if using a spinning wheel at home.When Slater was 14, his father died in an accident, and the teen was formally apprenticed to Strutt.Slater worked from dawn to dusk seven days a week.Processing raw cotton into cloth was challenging. Before the invention of the cotton gin in 1793, slaves picked out the seeds by hand.According to ""Samuel Slater's Mill"" by Christopher Simonds, ""For centuries the next steps were also done with hand tools, until new technology began dramatically increasing productivity"": First, the cotton was carded or drawn between two wire brushes to get all the fibers running in the same direction. Second, the mat of carded cotton went through a drawing machine, which stretched and tightened it into a loose yarn called a sliver. Third, the sliver was wound onto large spools called bobbins, which were put onto the spinning frame, whose whirling spindles stretched the yard and twisted the strands of the fiber, making it strong enough to be woven into cloth on a loom, still mostly by hand in homes.Armed with his knowledge, Slater left England without telling his family, lest word get out.He sewed his apprenticeship credentials into his coat to hide them before boarding. Arriving in New York City in the fall of 1789, he soon heard about a retired Quaker sea captain, Moses Brown, in Pawtucket, R.I., who was having trouble creating a cotton-spinning mill.So Slater wrote him a letter and landed the job.""Brown needed the good yarn for his weaving plants,"" wrote Klepper and Gunther. ""He had paid to have a small spinning frame built, but it didn't work well and he asked Slater to set up a new British-style textile machine, which allowed for continuous spinning, rather than the stop-and-start motion of the older machines.""Brown's location on a river was excellent, but Slater realized that even cannibalizing the machine Brown already had would leave him without vital parts, tools or knowledgeable mechanics.He knew about production problems in England, so he would have to draw on more than what he took out of that country. He used his mechanical skills to adapt the technology to American conditions.To help, Brown had him live with the Wilkinsons, a family of mechanics. ""Brown tried to hire Slater to build the machines and run the factory, but he refused to be a hired hand, and instead bartered his knowledge of cotton manufacturing into a half-interest in the new textile firm,"" wrote Barbara Tucker and Kenneth Tucker in ""Industrializing Antebellum America."" ""Two of Brown's relations, William Almy and Smith Brown, entered into the partnership of Almy, Brown and Slater. Slater was the archetype of the American immigrant: ambitious, risk taking and flexible in business, and he quickly adapted to the American economic scene while tailoring the British industrial system to the U.S. context.""It took nearly a year before the first cloth was produced, on Dec. 20, 1790. The building, which had 72 spindles to start out, is part of the National Park Service's Slater Mill Historic Site in Pawtucket.Firm FootingWithin its first 10 months, it had made 8,000 yards of cloth. Production was so furious, it had to stop temporarily so the owners could hire agents to sell in other cities.Brown wrote about the success of their venture to Alexander Hamilton, secretary of the Treasury, who shared the good news with Congress in December 1791.""The manufactory at Pawtucket,"" Hamilton said in his address, ""has the merit of being the first in introducing into the United States the celebrated cotton mill which not only furnished materials for the manufactory itself, but for the supply of private families for household manufactures.""In 1792, Slater received $5,000 (worth $126,000 now) for his share of the profit at a time when the average American worker earned $300 to $400 a year.The same year, he married Hannah Wilkinson, and they would have 10 children. ""She was a remarkable person in her own right,"" wrote Simonds. ""She must have observed her father's work closely, for she had a great deal of mechanical ability and developed a new method for making cotton sewing thread. In 1793 she became the first woman to be granted a patent by the U.S. government, and her invention would play an important role in the growth of the textile industry.""Slater began hiring children, as in England, whose size made it easy to get inside the machines and fix them when they malfunctioned.But he found that in America, parents expected to continue to have authority over their children, which sometimes interfered with work. He decided to hire entire families, with the fathers doing building construction and the mothers weaving.Sharing The KnowledgeSlater also set up company housing and provided schools for older kids to teach younger ones reading and writing on Sundays.In 1798 he split to form a partnership — Samuel Slater & Co. — with his father-in-law, Oziel Wilkinson. They developed other mills in Rhode Island, as well as in Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Hampshire.Slater's younger brother John came over the next year with the latest technology that was used to boost production by 20%.By 1810, America had some 50 cotton-yarn mills, many started after the U.S. embargo on British goods of 1807 cut off imports.By the end of the War of 1812 with Britain, 140 cotton manufacturers employing 26,000 people operating 130,000 spindles were within 30 miles of Providence, R.I.In 1823, Slater began installing power weaving looms in some factories. Five years later he bought a steam-driven cotton mill in Providence, ""a bold and imaginative move that allowed manufacturers to locate near their distribution points and supplies of labor rather than remain tied to river dam sites,"" wrote the Tuckers.But by 1829, Slater had become overextended, in part because of the economic panic that year.To protect his assets against creditors, he organized the umbrella firm of Samuel Slater & Sons, which under his son Horatio would become one of the leading manufacturers in the country.By the time Slater died at age 66, America had 2 million spindles, with the cotton trade processing 80 million pounds a year worth $47 million annually (equivalent to $1.3 billion now). The material had displaced British and Indian cotton in the Western Hemisphere.""Some of Slater's employees went on to found their own factories,"" Edward O'Donnell, author of the Great Courses' audiovisual program ""Turning Points in American History,"" told IBD. ""The most famous integrated textile manufacturing system was set up in 1814 in Waltham, Mass., by Francis Cabot Lowell, which became the prototype of the modern corporation. The Industrial Revolution quickly spread to pretty much everything else.""

422,MAT,"Border Security: As terror-torn France and other European countries put curbs on Islamic immigration, the Obama administration is waving foreign Muslim nationals into the U.S. in record numbers.According to a recent Center for Immigration Studies report, America between 2010 and 2013 imported more people from Muslim countries than Central America and Mexico combined. And now, with the president's executive amnesty, the welcome mat is bigger than ever.That's a major shift in immigration flows — and one that poses a major national security threat.If just a fraction of these nearly 300,000 new Muslim immigrants follow in the footsteps of the Franco-Algerian brothers who just terrorized Paris, we could be facing chronic terror. The main homeland threat from groups like the Islamic State comes through our immigration system. If they also use our loose policies as a vehicle for jihad, we will face the same crisis as France and the rest of Eurabia.If enough trained jihadist fighters get into the country, they could band together and launch regular car bombings and tactical assaults, effectively orchestrating insurgencies in our cities, including the capital.It's not far-fetched. Just 19 foreign Muslims killed some 3,000 Americans and crippled the economy within just two years of entering the U.S.Fifteen of them were Saudi nationals. Yet Obama welcomed 43,878 more Saudis from 2010 to 2013, mostly young men here on a student visa deal Obama cut with the Saudi king. At least 88,894 Saudis now live here.If some never show up on college campuses or they overstay their visas, it doesn't matter. Obama is no longer enforcing deportations.And if they qualify for amnesty, many can now get the kind of documentation — including Social Security cards, driver's licenses and work permits — that the 9/11 Commission warned against. Would-be foreign terrorists are freer than ever to conduct surveillance, coordinate operations, receive funding, go to flight school, obtain weapons and materials, and execute attacks.Over the 2010-2013 period, Obama let in an additional 41,094 from war-torn Iraq and 38,644 from Egypt. Meanwhile, he's cut Israeli immigration by 817.While America ushers in Islamic immigrants, Europe is pulling up the welcome mat.In recent months, both France and Britain have proposed imposing curbs on immigration out of fear of importing more terrorists. The bills will likely pass in the wake of the Paris massacre.Thanks to mass immigration from North Africa, France's Muslim population has swelled to 6.5 million, or 10% of its population. More than 1,000 French Muslims have joined IS. A recent poll found that 27% of French Muslims ages 18-24 support the Islamic State.Growing pockets of radicalism are spreading in towns throughout France. There are no-go zones for police, not just in Paris but all over the country. Authorities say that they've lost control of the situation. Muslim attacks on police and synagogues are now regular events.The problem has been that many of these Muslim immigrants refuse to integrate into Western society. And now some are killing their hosts.Why are we letting foreign Muslims flood our shores when most of Europe now regrets liberalizing immigration from Muslim countries? We are just setting ourselves up for the same internal security crisis.

Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) outperformed, rising 2% as crude oil soared more than 4%.Carmax (KMX) blasted up 11% to a new all-time high after reporting third-quarter results before the open. The used car seller's earnings climbed 28% on a 16% rise in revenue, topping analyst forecasts.Biotechs Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Biogen (BIIB) posted big gains in active trading. Biogen climbed 2% touching a new high. The stock is in buying range after clearing a choppy consolidation with 347.85 buy point.Endurance (EIGI), a provider of cloud-based marketing software, climbed 4% to a new high. The stock has added 17% for the week. Average daily trading volume has risen steadily over the past two months to more than 400,000 shares a day.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting EPS of $1.45.Revenue increased 7.3% to $1.47 billion, in line with views.Shares rose 4% to 56 in the stock market today. Hasbro has a Relative Strength rating of 78, meaning its shares currently outperforming 78% of all stocks on the market.The boys category captured 32.6% of Hasbro's quarterly revenue at $478.5 million, a 22% surge from last year. Hasbro credits the growth to Transformers, Marvel, Star Wars and Nerf toys.Hasbro's action figure sales benefited from several 2014 blockbusters, with the premiere of ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" on June 27, just days before the start of the third quarter.This year has also been a big year for Marvel movies, with the most recent film, ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" hitting theaters Aug. 1. And while not premiering in the third quarter, ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" movies were released in April and May, respectively, giving Hasbro more opportunities to sell those toys in the third quarter, as their movies make the transition to DVD and Blu-ray.Revenue for the girls segment rose only 5% from last year to $407.7 million, but Hasbro made a deal with Disney (DIS) in late September to make dolls based on the popular animated movie ""Frozen"" and other Disney Princess stories, a blow to rival Mattel (MAT). Starting in 2016, global rights to the dolls transfer from the Barbie maker to Hasbro.In addition to the big screen, Hasbro has also used the small screen to garner more attention for its toy characters. Hasbro has a TV joint venture with Discovery Communications (DISCA), previously called Hub Network, which was renamed Discovery Family Channel on Oct. 13. The deal also reduced Hasbro's stake in the partnership from 50% to 40%.The new name and new structure will help the company ""broaden its programming focus to serve families in primetime"" and continue to show Hasbro Studios children's content in daytime, according to the company. The restructuring of Hasbro's investment led to a pre-tax charge of $11.6 million, or 6 cents a share, in Q3.During the quarter, Hasbro repurchased 2.4 million shares at an average price of $52.56 per share, costing the company $124.5 million and bringing its total share repurchases for the first nine months of 2014 to 6.4 million.The company did not issue any forward-looking statements in its press release, but said in its conference call with analysts that it has ""entered the holiday season well-positioned.""Follow Alissa Williams on Twitter: @IBD_AWilliams.

426,MAT,"Politics: Amid applause, President Obama has made fighting Ebola in Africa a military priority, to protect U.S. health. So why is he doing nothing about the raft of new diseases that may be rolling in from our unguarded border?'We can't dawdle on this one,"" the president intoned this week, announcing that he would be putting 3,000 boots on the ground in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, in a $600 million rescue effort for three nations badly hit by the dreaded Ebola epidemic.""We have to move with force and make sure that we are catching this as best we can, given that it has already broken out in ways that we have not seen before.""And to make sure the whole effort seemed more about protecting the U.S. than the charity effort in a distant corner of the globe it is, he turned up the verbal panic knobs: ""It's spiraling out of control. If the outbreak is not stopped now, we could be looking at hundreds of thousands of people infected with profound political and economic and security implications for all of us.""It might be believable if he showed the same concern and priority for the strange new diseases now spreading and infecting Americans here, which at least one prominent U.S. doctor says may be spread by illegal aliens now in our country with zero health care screening as part of Obama's open borders policy.Dr. Jane Orient, Executive Director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, told radio host Laura Ingraham Thursday that the Obama administration has been ""real tight lipped"" about a new respiratory illness known as enterovirus D68 that has affected 153 children in 19 states in the U.S., the latest four in San Diego and Ventura counties in California.""We don't know where it's coming from ... are there immigrants from Central America, where this disease has allegedly been prevalent before? Should we be (studying) the virus to see whether it's like what's been found in some of these countries that are just sending waves of children across our border and they haven't been quarantined long enough to make sure they're not sick?"" she asked, according to a Breitbart TV report.As a matter of fact there have been a terrifying rash of new diseases in the region. In Venezuela, a man-made health crisis is engulfing the country as doctor flight (including even its Cuban doctors) and an absence of medicine, bandages, sanitation supplies and all the other signature shortages of socialism have left its once excellent health care system in a state of collapse.Venezuela has confirmed 398 cases of chikungunya fever, 55,970 cases of malaria and 45,745 cases of dengue fever — all diseases that were either unknown or else had had been eradicated from the country two decades ago. There's also 9 deaths from a strange new, unnamed hemorrhagic fever in Aragua state.Meanwhile, in Honduras, El Salvador and Costa Rica, a monster dengue epidemic is raging through the region right now, with 120,000 cases, and 60 deaths, and public health emergencies declared in those countries.Funds earmarked for the Red Cross to combat it amount to a meager $169,000, according to a report in the British Guardian. Yet El Salvador and Honduras remain major shippers of illegals to the U.S.To assume dengue is the only problem coming out of those countries, with many viruses known to travel along the same vectors as dengue, and with a heavy rainy season along with hurricanes is naivete.The reality is, an unguarded border, a welcome-mat approach to illegals, well developed smuggling networks, and zero medical screening are virtually a guarantee of the spread of new diseases — and demand the political will to investigate it.But the president's focus is on Africa right now, and on the frightening disease that has caught the media's attention and which may get his poll numbers up.Yet the millions of malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS cases far more rampant in those African countries are getting no attention. Nor are the illnesses that could easily come up here from the south.It points to crass politics — a wag-the-dog bid to divert public attention from the president's other political problems, and a pander for the Latino vote.This is no way to deal with epidemics.

428,MAT,"Amnesty: Now that President Obama has made the Constitution a welcome mat for illegals to wipe their feet on, Republicans can make a series of moves. This should be treated as the national emergency it is.For the president to shield up to 5 million aliens from the deportation that statute requires is as much an unconstitutional act as it is an invitation to millions more to find any and every way in, knowing that this is no longer a nation of laws but of loopholes.But with his own party either too corrupt or too cowardly to oppose him, and a lap dog media that wags its tail at his lefty ideology, impeachment isn't realistic.A number of other moves are quite realistic, however, and would go a long way toward fixing the problem: Emergency Border Action: With more than 100,000 more illegals expected to flood over the border next year, Congress should consider Obama's executive action the cause of a state of emergency — and House Speaker John Boehner and soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell should say exactly that, then act on it by passing emergency legislation to secure the border with thousands of new personnel and lots of new resources. A Guest Worker Program That Works: If our Canuck neighbors to the north, and many other countries, can use foreigners as temporary workers — and then make them return home — then we can, too.We must bar alien participants from seeking U.S. citizenship. Skillfully designed, good guest-worker legislation could even make business interests now favoring amnesty (in search of cheap labor) change their views and stop supporting a process that, if it continues, will give anti-business Democrats a permanent ruling majority in America in a decade or two. Move Against Election Fraud: With Old Dominion University last month finding that nearly 6.5% of noncitizens voted illegally in the 2008 presidential election, illegal aliens now practice enough voter fraud to sway the outcome of close elections.The new Congress should pass a bill to bring the days of registering voters without checking ID to a permanent end.Americans cherish the right to vote, but wave after wave of illegal immigration has inexcusably cheapened it. Reclaim the Reagan Democrats: With Obama's economic policies keeping America in the worst economic ""recovery"" ever, the middle class and lower-middle class are about to find 5 million new legalized permanent residents competing for employment in a still-dismal job market.The new GOP Congress should ask them, many of whom voted for Obama twice, how it feels to be sacrificed on the altar of liberal ideology.The president's emperorlike edict is inarguably an attack on the American system of governance.But it is also one of the greatest opportunities an incoming Congress has ever had.

429,MAT,"Hasbro shot up nearly 4% on above-average volume Wednesday on news that it will partner with Disney Consumer Products to make dolls based on the Disney animated movie ""Frozen"" and other Disney Princess stories.The move is a blow to rival Mattel (MAT), which makes dolls based on the Disney (DIS) characters. Starting in 2016, global rights to the dolls transfer to Hasbro (HAS).Financial terms were not disclosed.That wasn't the only good news of the week for the toy maker. On Thursday, it announced that the Hub Network, its partnership with Discovery Communications (DISCA), will become the Discovery Family Channel. The channel will broaden its offerings to focus on family fare in prime time and continue to showcase Hasbro Studios children's shows in the daytime. The deal reduces Hasbro's stake in the partnership from 50% to 40%.Technically, Hasbro is in good shape. Wednesday's action was a breakout from a 20-week double-bottom with a handle. The buy point is 54.35, the top of the handle. Seven of the last eight weeks were up as the stock ascended the right side of the base and broke out.The stock corrected just 16%, slightly more than the 15% maximum for a flat base but still tight action.In the most recent quarter, earnings rose 24%. Sales growth was just 8% but showed acceleration. For the next report, analysts forecast earnings to rise 80%.The five-year annualized EPS growth rate is just 2%, but analysts foresee 40% growth this year and 10% in 2015. The Earnings Stability Factor is 10 on a 0 to 99 scale, where low numbers correspond to steady growth.The return on equity for 2013 was 19%, better than the 17% benchmark that investors should seek. The quarterly dividend is 43 cents a share, which works out to an annualized yield of more than 3%.

430,MAT,"Subprime Redux: Mel Watt's easy credit crusade is now off and running. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's chief regulator has officially lowered lending standards for the entire mortgage industry. Here we go again.In January, we warned that Watt's swearing-in as head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency would mark the start of the next housing bubble. We pointed out that the Congressional Black Caucus' former head has a soft spot for those who can't afford homes and that as a Democrat lawmaker he pressed Freddie to lend even to ""welfare recipients"" in his district.""Expect him to reboot the era of easy credit,"" we warned. ""Watch him use his control of Freddie and Fannie to return to the recklessly lax policies that caused the mortgage crisis.""Now comes news that he and the nationalized mortgage giants have drawn up new rules aimed at loosening underwriting standards to make home loans more affordable and easier to get for low-income borrowers with poor credit.No longer will Fannie and Freddie require down payments of at least 5% for conventional loans. Now it will buy mortgages with a minimum down payment of 3%, mimicking what took place before the mortgage crisis and matching the subprime standard set by the Federal Housing Administration.FHA had picked up the subprime slack from Fannie and Freddie after they collapsed from the weight of millions of subprime mortgages. Now the Toxic Twins are returning to that market, and will likely dominate it again.Fannie and Freddie already back 60% of all mortgages originated in the private market and guarantee 90% of all new mortgages underwritten. When they set a standard, the entire mortgage industry follows.The easier guidelines are designed to convince lenders that they won't regret lending to high-risk, less-than-creditworthy borrowers. Unlike previously, they'll no longer be penalized with higher fees or repurchase demands if they make risky loans.In devising the new standards, the administration has huddled with the same affordable-housing activists who pressured Fannie and Freddie and private lenders to lower standards before the last crisis.The left-wing Center for Responsible Lending, for one, complained that tight standards sideline too many low-income minority homebuyers. ""Those folks took it on the chin the hardest and have been least able to get up off of the mat,"" the housing-rights group said. ""That's a serious challenge in terms of building wealth.""""There's a perception of a lot of risk in lending to these communities,"" the center added. ""After the crisis, the pendulum of mortgage credit standards swung to a far extreme. It's now working it's way back.""Yeah, back to financial disaster. This is the ""reform"" President Obama promised for housing finance.

432,MAT,"ObamaCare's impact on jobs is hotly debated by politicians and economists. Critics say the Affordable Care Act gives businesses an incentive to cut workers' hours below the 30-hour-per-week threshold at which the employer mandate to provide health insurance kicks in. White House economists dismiss such evidence as anecdotal, but BLS data show that the workweek in low-wage sectors sank to a record low in July — just before the Obama administration delayed enforcement of the employer mandate until 2015.In the interest of an informed debate, we've compiled a list of job actions with strong proof that ObamaCare's employer mandate is behind cuts to work hours or staffing levels. As of September 5th, our ObamaCare scorecard included 450 employers with more than 100 school districts among them. Recently, IBD explained that a big minimum wage hike alongside the employer mandate would add to pressure on employers to cut workers to part-time, complicating the goal of reducing inequality.Click on the employer names in the list below for links to supporting records, mostly news accounts or official documents.We'll continue to update the list, which we encourage you to share and download into a spreadsheet to sort and analyze.

433,MAT,"Kevin O'Leary of TV's hit show ""Shark Tank"" tells entrepreneurs what they don't want to hear.He's brutally honest with contestants on the ABC investment reality show in a way that often recalls the jarring Simon Cowell, the former judge on ""American Idol.""The other Sharks on the show, which is rated No. 1 on Friday nights, sarcastically call O'Leary Mr. Wonderful. The nickname has stuck. When he shows up at hotels, they often have the reservation under his nickname.""I am Mr. Wonderful because it's wonderful to be told the truth,"" O'Leary, the author of  ""Cold Hard Truth on Men, Women & Money,"" told IBD. ""Everyone else coddles people even when their ideas don't have any merit. In money, there's no gray, only black and white — you make it or you lose it.""Whatever one thinks of his sharp tongue, he knows what he's talking about, with a net worth of $300 million, according to Forbes.O'Leary, 59, was born in Montreal. He seemed predestined for business, given the charisma and wit of his Irish salesman father and his financially conscious mother.But when Kevin was 6, Mom grew tired of Dad's gambling, divorced him and married a student pursuing a Ph.D. in business with just $36 to his name.Not EasyDuring the ensuing custody battle, Kevin's mother kept them safe from his dad's rough friends by taking Kevin and his brother to Switzerland. They returned a couple of months later when the father died of a heart attack.O'Leary's stepfather became an official at the United Nations, and they moved frequently to such nations as Ethiopia and Cyprus.The boys' parents made sure they mixed with the locals and not just U.N. families. ""I had a chance to experience different cultures, something that has made me a better investor,"" said O'Leary. ""Now I can go back to places like Cambodia, where the country has had a dramatic turnaround, and see great opportunities. I'd tell anyone starting a career today that they should consider going where there is high single-digit growth, like China, India, Brazil or Vietnam.""His mother contributed to his future success by showing him the value of frugality, how every saved dollar could become a fortune with patience. Her sons worked hard at whatever jobs were available.Back in Canada, after graduating from high school, O'Leary attended the Royal Military College Saint-Jean in Quebec for two years, then in 1977 earned a bachelor's degree in psychology and environmental science at the University of Waterloo in Ontario. Three years later came his MBA at the University of Western Ontario.After working as an assistant product manager at the Nabisco snack firm — now a subsidiary of Kraft Foods Group (KRFT) — O'Leary and two friends founded Special Event Television, which produced sports programming.One of his partners bought him out for $25,000. So he invested part of the money in a startup, the software publisher SoftKey International, alongside two associates in 1983. With O'Leary as president, working out of his basement, the three compiled software on CD-ROMs.They lost money at first. But over the next decade, they bought other publishers and grew fast by shedding those units' overhead.""I learned that acquisitions need to be truly accretive quickly, and today shareholders don't have patience for anything that might only provide long-term benefits,"" he said. ""What's troubling is that industry consolidation is mainly about tax efficiency, which shows how screwed up the tax code is.""In 1990, O'Leary married Linda Greer and they would have two children, Savannah and Trevor. He makes sure they get together on weekends, no matter where he is. O'Leary owns several houses worldwide; he says his home is wherever the family can meet.By 1995, SoftKey had bought up 60 rivals, including The Learning Co. — a leader in educational software programs — and took on its name. The next year O'Leary's firm moved to Boston. By 1999, The Learning Co. had 467 titles and $800 million in annual sales. That year, it was acquired by Mattel (MAT) in a $4.2 billion stock swap that gave O'Leary a big stake in the company.Mattel saw an opportunity to expand from toys to education. Yet O'Leary departed in 2000 when Mattel sales declined.Three years later, O'Leary became a director with Storage Now, helping the firm become Canada's third largest owner of climate-controlled storehouses.Storage Now was bought by InStorage REIT in 2007 for $110 million, and eventually TKG StorageMart bought the whole outfit.After exiting Mattel as a shareholder, O'Leary became an investment adviser to Genstar Capital and Hamilton Trust, while appearing on financial TV shows in Canada and America.Riding The RulesO'Leary's personal portfolio got clobbered when the Great Recession hit in 2008. He realized he had to return to his mother's investment principles, which are the foundation of O'Leary Funds:• Invest no more than 5% in one stock and only 20% in one segment.• Put money in stocks that pay dividends or in interest-bearing bonds.• Don't invest in anything you don't understand.• If something sounds too good to be true, it is.• Be patient.Just as crucial as the right investments is not wasting money, says O'Leary. In his book and on his website, he offers tips on how to save the critical 10% of income necessary to become rich with good decisions, big and small:• Don't blow money on a big wedding.• Rent instead of buying a house if the mortgage will cost more than 25% of your income — 30% in expensive cities.• Don't buy anything fancy for the baby, who won't appreciate it anyway while you go broke.• Live where you can walk or take mass transit to work.• Instead of joining an expensive diet club, have your doctor design a personal food plan.His empire encompasses everything from O'Leary Mortgages to O'Leary Fine Wines.Apparently, he has good taste.""I was about to buy a winemaker when one approached me about handling the growing, bottling and distribution, so I could concentrate on the product and brand,"" he said. ""I'm probably the only winemaker who was profitable in the first 60 days. I was surprised my name could carry a wine brand, but people trust me, and we've won awards and gone from 5,000 cases the first season to expecting 20,000 in what will be our third.""Time To GoO'Leary's travel time is managed by his assistant, Nancy Cheung, who allocates each 30-minute segment based on return on investment.In 2006 he became one of the stars of the Canadian version of a Japanese venture-capital reality TV show called ""Dragons' Den."" The original has been spun off in markets from Nigeria to Afghanistan, evidence of the universal attraction of entrepreneurship.Another one of the original Dragons was Robert Herjavec, who is now with O'Leary on the American version, ""Shark Tank,"" which debuted in 2009. In each season of the ABC show, 150 small-business owners — winnowed down from 360,000 applicants this year — pitch the Sharks ideas for expansion in exchange for a percentage of the startup, debt financing or a royalty on sales.Daily operations of O'Leary's ""Shark Tank"" commitments are headed by Alex Kenjeev, president of O'Leary Ventures, which manages the 23 he's invested in. One is Wicked Good Cupcakes of Cohasset, Mass., which ships the treats in jars. The firm's leaders were doing less than $200,000 a year when they landed on ""Shark Tank."" ""We're expecting $5 million next year,"" O'Leary said. ""They started with seven employees and now have 50.""Michael DuDell, author of ""Shark Tank Jump Start Your Business,"" is impressed with such sweet success: ""Kevin is one of the most disciplined, pragmatic investors I know. He doesn't get caught up in the hype that often plagues the startup community. His solitary goal is to get a return on his investment, which may not be popular to admit, but it's a big part of what makes him so successful.""Said O'Leary: ""I love to finance and work with entrepreneurs, so I'm having the time of my life now.""

434,MAT,"Immigration: Little by little, California Gov. Jerry Brown and his Democratic allies in the legislature have made their state a laboratory for open-border policies. The rest of America should be paying much closer attention.As President Obama mulls an executive order to legalize millions of illegal aliens, he can look West for inspiration. When it comes to undercutting our nation's immigration law, the Golden State is way ahead of him.Just this week, Brown appeared with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and all but welcomed more illegals to California. A slip of the tongue? Hardly.Brown knew the Mexican's trip was big news and widely followed south of the border. He might as well have laid out a mat with ""Welcome Illegals"" on it.Pena Nieto's comments were also telling. ""This is the other Mexico,"" he said in Los Angeles — in Spanish.He's right. With just 12% of U.S. population, California is home to nearly 30% of the nation's 11 million illegal immigrants. And with one-third of Mexico's citizens saying in a recent poll they'd like to relocate to the U.S., don't expect that number to shrink soon.By the way, California is also home to 25% of the nation's welfare recipients. Just a coincidence?Brown and other California Democrats have found pandering to illegals and the mostly far-left groups that support them to be politically profitable.Most recently, Democrats have tried to kill English-only education in the state. A seemingly small thing, it would create a permanent Spanish-speaking underclass dependent on welfare and the Democratic Party.And following a recent ACLU lawsuit, the federal government announced this week that it will let as many as a quarter-million deportees return to California. Democrats quietly supported the suit.As we said, nothing new. Last year, Brown signed a number of bills that make it easier for illegals to come to California and stay — law and the border be damned.One of those bills makes it illegal for police to hand illegal immigrants over to the federal government, unless they committed a serious crime.Another gives illegals driver's licenses, providing them instant access to all sorts of government goodies and setting up massive potential voter fraud.All this costs taxpayers billions, but Democrats don't care. They long for an unassailable electoral majority as far as the eye can see.Obama once lived in California. He knows how this works. Now he's bringing it to the rest of America.

435,MAT,"Looking at a toy stock requires a wide-angle lens.Quarter-to-quarter action is generally irrelevant because of the seasonal nature of the business. Mattel (MAT) CEO Bryan Stockton refers to the first half of the calendar year as ""the preseason."" The second half of the year is when most of the scoring occurs.Over the past three years, the second half accounted for 85% to 90% of Mattel's full-year earnings.The Street expects Mattel's 2013 earnings to total $2.75 a share, a 9% increase over 2012. In 2014, analysts expect a 9% pop to $3 a share.Mattel pays a quarterly dividend of 36 cents a share. The annualized dividend is up 16% from the prior year. The yield is 3%.Before 2011, Mattel paid a dividend once a year. In 2011, the company began paying quarterly dividends.The payout has grown 92% since 2009.Mattel's fundamentals are strong. Pretax margin in 2012 was 17%, a nine-year high. Return on equity was 31%, also a nine-year high.The stock has cleared the 46.64 buy point of a handle in a stage-two base.Research indicates that a first- or second-stage breakout is more likely to work than breakouts from later-stage bases.Mattel's up-down volume ratio is a bullish 1.6, well above the neutral 1.0 level. The Accumulation/Distribution Rating is B+, pointing to institutional buying.For the toy industry, though, much hinges on consumer spending. While some market watchers say recent improvements in U.S. economic data should boost consumer spending in 2014, others argue that ObamaCare will force more people to pay more for health care and insurance, leaving less money for discretionary spending.The U.S. toy market makes up about a quarter of the global market, according to NPD Group, a consumer market researcher. The U.S. accounts for 55% of Mattel's revenue.

Yet the stock rose nearly 5% in heavy volume as analysts said the results were good enough to put the company on a good footing for 2014.The dividend declared is payable May 15 to shareholders of record May 1.

498,MAT,"As a race car driver, Mario Andretti was inexhaustible.
"
499,MAT,"""I was never getting enough,"" he told IBD. ""I felt there weren't enough races. If I had a weekend off, I would book something else.""
"
500,MAT,"Talk about an adrenaline-fueled schedule.
"
501,MAT,"Days after finessing his Formula One car around the 2.6-mile track in Buenos Aires, Argentina, he'd duel on dirt at a sprint car race in Du Quoin, Ill.
"
502,MAT,"Each event offered a different spin on competition, new insights into driving and the all-important checkered flag.
"
503,MAT,"""I wasn't gallivanting to other disciplines just to be there,"" he said. ""I wanted to win. Then, mission accomplished.""
"
504,MAT,"Such hot pursuit yielded versatility.
"
505,MAT,"Sweep
"
506,MAT,"Andretti is the only driver to clench this trio: Daytona 500 winner (1967), Indianapolis 500 victor (1969) and Formula One world champion (1978).
"
507,MAT,"Add longevity — Andretti's professional career spanned 31 years — and the honors pile up:
"
508,MAT,"Four-time IndyCar champion ('65, '66, '69, '84).
"
509,MAT,"Three-time 12 Hours of Sebring winner ('67, '70, '72).
"
510,MAT,"USAC National Dirt Track champion ('74).
"
511,MAT,"International Race of Champions titlist ('79).
"
512,MAT,"Pikes Peak Hill Climb winner ('69).
"
513,MAT,"The only racer named Driver of the Year in three decades ('69, '78, '84), Andretti was also dubbed Driver of the Century in 1999 by the Associated Press.
"
514,MAT,"How to triumph? ""Mario has told me in the past that desire is the big separator between the champions and the also-rans,"" said Derek Daly, Formula One driver and ""Race to Win"" author.
"
515,MAT,"Added Daly: ""This desire, along with his fully developed skills, allowed him to be competitive for longer than any other driver.""
"
516,MAT,"Andretti, 72, kept his foot to the pedal to the end of his racing run.
"
517,MAT,"During his final IndyCar season — 1994's ""Arrivederci, Mario"" tour — he scored his 100th major career victory in Phoenix at age 53.
"
518,MAT,"Then he set a fastest-in-the-world closed-course speed of 234.275 mph during qualifying at Michigan International Speedway.
"
519,MAT,"""Intensity comes with the desire, the desire to achieve,"" he said.
"
520,MAT,"Hardly born with a silver stick shift in hand, Andretti hit every mile marker between the shoestring competitor and champagne-soaked legend.
"
521,MAT,"War And On The Move
"
522,MAT,"Born in 1940 in Montona, Italy — now part of Croatia — Andretti had a childhood that included Nazis taking over his grandmother's hotel and a grenade lobbed into the yard where he played with twin brother Aldo.
"
523,MAT,"The end of World War II in 1945 brought both relief and loss.
"
524,MAT,"Redrawn borders made the Andretti homestead part of communist Yugoslavia.
"
525,MAT,"His father, Gigi, fled with his wife, Rina, and their three children to displaced persons camps in Udine and Lucca, Italy.
"
526,MAT,"Conditions were dire those seven years, but Mario and Aldo dreamed big in their shared top bunk.
"
527,MAT,"One day they'd be hotshot drivers. People would say: ""There go the famous Andrettis.""
"
528,MAT,"Famous like Alberto Ascari, the cool and lightning-quick Italian racer Mario idolized.
"
529,MAT,"""I knew what I wanted early on in life,"" Andretti said. ""I had no idea how to go about it.""
"
530,MAT,"So he started where he was.
"
531,MAT,"Steering Up
"
532,MAT,"The 13-year-olds talked a local garage owner into letting them park cars, sneaked joy rides on a family friend's scooter and schemed how they'd break into big-time racing.
"
533,MAT,"Then another spin. The Andretti family was moving to America — an ocean away from the road courses they intended to conquer.
"
534,MAT,"Within days of arriving at an uncle's house in Nazareth, Pa., the 15-year-olds found their future — a nearby, half-mile dirt oval.
"
535,MAT,"The track and cars were foreign, but the speed translated just fine.
"
536,MAT,"First things first — the boys hustled to master English and catch up in school. When a strict principal insisted on holding them back, Mario took the GED route.
"
537,MAT,"""I went after correspondence courses as I do everything else — flat out,"" Andretti wrote in the 1970 autobiography, ""What's It Like Out There?""
"
538,MAT,"His tutor, Dee Ann Hoch, became his wife of 50 years — ""the best contract I ever signed,"" Andretti wrote.
"
539,MAT,"The way negatives could turn positive made Andretti an optimist. Lesson learned: Always look for the bright side.
"
540,MAT,"The boys might not have money, but they had resources.
"
541,MAT,"To buy their first race car — a 1948 Hudson Hornet — the duo sold shares to friends for $5 to $20.
"
542,MAT,"""Right from the start, I looked at racing as a business,"" Andretti wrote.
"
543,MAT,"Driving, on the other hand, was an anything-goes affair.
"
544,MAT,"""We just revved it up and stood on it — and who cares about anybody or anything that got in our way,"" Andretti wrote of his and Aldo's racing debut in March 1959.
"
545,MAT,"Within months, they experienced the sport's hardest knock.
"
546,MAT,"Mario watched trackside, helpless, as an end-over-end crash put Aldo in a two-week coma. He'd recover and race again before retiring in 1969.
"
547,MAT,"But in the moment, their father turned his anger on Mario. The Andretti patriarch envisioned his sons going into business, just not a dangerous one.
"
548,MAT,"""Initially I had to go against his wishes because I believed in what I was doing,"" Mario said.
"
549,MAT,"To make good on his big-time dreams, the young driver needed to get noticed.
"
550,MAT,"With a loan from his father-in-law, Andretti shifted into three-quarter midget racing.
"
551,MAT,"The open wheelers ran all winter at indoor tracks, which meant more time in the driver's seat, more chances to win and all-important exposure; big-time team owners and sponsors spent the cold months watching arena races.
"
552,MAT,"""That was another plus — a chance to be seen by the right people,"" he wrote.
"
553,MAT,"Four victories and 24 top-10 finishes in 1962 turned the heads of car owners Bill and Eddie Mataka, who asked Andretti to drive their midget car the following summer.

"
569,MAT,"For Andretti, life is one long pursuit: ""It's all about passion, believing in something and wanting something.""As a race car driver, Mario Andretti was inexhaustible.""I was never getting enough,"" he told IBD. ""I felt there weren't enough races. If I had a weekend off, I would book something else.""Talk about an adrenaline-fueled schedule.Days after finessing his Formula One car around the 2.6-mile track in Buenos Aires, Argentina, he'd duel on dirt at a sprint car race in Du Quoin, Ill.Each event offered a different spin on competition, new insights into driving and the all-important checkered flag.""I wasn't gallivanting to other disciplines just to be there,"" he said. ""I wanted to win. Then, mission accomplished.""Such hot pursuit yielded versatility.SweepAndretti is the only driver to clench this trio: Daytona 500 winner (1967), Indianapolis 500 victor (1969) and Formula One world champion (1978).Add longevity — Andretti's professional career spanned 31 years — and the honors pile up:Four-time IndyCar champion ('65, '66, '69, '84).Three-time 12 Hours of Sebring winner ('67, '70, '72).USAC National Dirt Track champion ('74).International Race of Champions titlist ('79).Pikes Peak Hill Climb winner ('69).The only racer named Driver of the Year in three decades ('69, '78, '84), Andretti was also dubbed Driver of the Century in 1999 by the Associated Press.How to triumph? ""Mario has told me in the past that desire is the big separator between the champions and the also-rans,"" said Derek Daly, Formula One driver and ""Race to Win"" author.Added Daly: ""This desire, along with his fully developed skills, allowed him to be competitive for longer than any other driver.""Andretti, 72, kept his foot to the pedal to the end of his racing run.During his final IndyCar season — 1994's ""Arrivederci, Mario"" tour — he scored his 100th major career victory in Phoenix at age 53.Then he set a fastest-in-the-world closed-course speed of 234.275 mph during qualifying at Michigan International Speedway.""Intensity comes with the desire, the desire to achieve,"" he said.Hardly born with a silver stick shift in hand, Andretti hit every mile marker between the shoestring competitor and champagne-soaked legend.War And On The MoveBorn in 1940 in Montona, Italy — now part of Croatia — Andretti had a childhood that included Nazis taking over his grandmother's hotel and a grenade lobbed into the yard where he played with twin brother Aldo.The end of World War II in 1945 brought both relief and loss.Redrawn borders made the Andretti homestead part of communist Yugoslavia.His father, Gigi, fled with his wife, Rina, and their three children to displaced persons camps in Udine and Lucca, Italy.Conditions were dire those seven years, but Mario and Aldo dreamed big in their shared top bunk.One day they'd be hotshot drivers. People would say: ""There go the famous Andrettis.""Famous like Alberto Ascari, the cool and lightning-quick Italian racer Mario idolized.""I knew what I wanted early on in life,"" Andretti said. ""I had no idea how to go about it.""So he started where he was.Steering UpThe 13-year-olds talked a local garage owner into letting them park cars, sneaked joy rides on a family friend's scooter and schemed how they'd break into big-time racing.Then another spin. The Andretti family was moving to America — an ocean away from the road courses they intended to conquer.Within days of arriving at an uncle's house in Nazareth, Pa., the 15-year-olds found their future — a nearby, half-mile dirt oval.The track and cars were foreign, but the speed translated just fine.First things first — the boys hustled to master English and catch up in school. When a strict principal insisted on holding them back, Mario took the GED route.""I went after correspondence courses as I do everything else — flat out,"" Andretti wrote in the 1970 autobiography, ""What's It Like Out There?""His tutor, Dee Ann Hoch, became his wife of 50 years — ""the best contract I ever signed,"" Andretti wrote.The way negatives could turn positive made Andretti an optimist. Lesson learned: Always look for the bright side.The boys might not have money, but they had resources.To buy their first race car — a 1948 Hudson Hornet — the duo sold shares to friends for $5 to $20.""Right from the start, I looked at racing as a business,"" Andretti wrote.Driving, on the other hand, was an anything-goes affair.""We just revved it up and stood on it — and who cares about anybody or anything that got in our way,"" Andretti wrote of his and Aldo's racing debut in March 1959.Within months, they experienced the sport's hardest knock.Mario watched trackside, helpless, as an end-over-end crash put Aldo in a two-week coma. He'd recover and race again before retiring in 1969.But in the moment, their father turned his anger on Mario. The Andretti patriarch envisioned his sons going into business, just not a dangerous one.""Initially I had to go against his wishes because I believed in what I was doing,"" Mario said.To make good on his big-time dreams, the young driver needed to get noticed.With a loan from his father-in-law, Andretti shifted into three-quarter midget racing.The open wheelers ran all winter at indoor tracks, which meant more time in the driver's seat, more chances to win and all-important exposure; big-time team owners and sponsors spent the cold months watching arena races.""That was another plus — a chance to be seen by the right people,"" he wrote.Four victories and 24 top-10 finishes in 1962 turned the heads of car owners Bill and Eddie Mataka, who asked Andretti to drive their midget car the following summer.Given an opening, he roared through — and rose through the ranks of sprint cars, stock cars, the IndyCar circuit and Formula One.His first F1 race — the 1968 season opener at Watkins Glen, N.Y. — exemplified the driver's intensity and ability, noted ""Mario Andretti"" biographer Gordon Kirby.For qualifying, car owner Colin Chapman pushed Andretti to run on treaded tires.

"
611,MAT,"The best stocks don't always provide an easy entry.
"
612,MAT,"Sometimes an investor looks at the chart of a stock with ideal fundamentals and sees nothing actionable. ""A long run-up with too many pullbacks,"" the investor says.
"
613,MAT,"In many cases, that's true. But in other cases, the investor is looking but not seeing.
"
614,MAT,"At first glance, the ascending base looks like something an investor shouldn't touch.
"
615,MAT,"The pattern consists of a series of short pullbacks with higher highs and higher lows. For the investor who knows only a little about charts, the cup base and the flat base are easily recognized.
"
616,MAT,"But a little knowledge isn't always enough. To the untrained eye, the ascending base doesn't look like a base. Because it forms amid a larger climb, the pattern is harder to spot than other bases. The action will look like ordinary pullbacks of an extended stock.
"
617,MAT,"Here are four tips to help investors recognize this pattern:
"
618,MAT,"First, look for ascending bases in weak or uneven markets. Those are the kind of markets that are likely to give birth to ascending bases.
"
619,MAT,"Second, look for three pullbacks on the stock's chart, each having a higher top and a higher low than the previous pullback. Each decline should be 10% to 20% from the previous peak.
"
620,MAT,"Third, look at the chart through a wide angle lens, so to speak. The total base typically takes nine to 16 weeks to form, which is longer than what's often seen in other bases.
"
621,MAT,"Fourth, remember a stock must climb at least 20% from its latest buy point before the stock can form a new base. The same goes for an ascending base.
"
622,MAT,"The buy point on an ascending base is 10 cents past the highest price level of the third pullback.
"

625,MAT,"For more charts of ascending bases, see pages 138-140 in the fourth edition of ""How to Make Money in Stocks.""The best stocks don't always provide an easy entry.Sometimes an investor looks at the chart of a stock with ideal fundamentals and sees nothing actionable. ""A long run-up with too many pullbacks,"" the investor says.In many cases, that's true. But in other cases, the investor is looking but not seeing.At first glance, the ascending base looks like something an investor shouldn't touch.The pattern consists of a series of short pullbacks with higher highs and higher lows. For the investor who knows only a little about charts, the cup base and the flat base are easily recognized.But a little knowledge isn't always enough. To the untrained eye, the ascending base doesn't look like a base. Because it forms amid a larger climb, the pattern is harder to spot than other bases. The action will look like ordinary pullbacks of an extended stock.Here are four tips to help investors recognize this pattern:First, look for ascending bases in weak or uneven markets. Those are the kind of markets that are likely to give birth to ascending bases.Second, look for three pullbacks on the stock's chart, each having a higher top and a higher low than the previous pullback. Each decline should be 10% to 20% from the previous peak.Third, look at the chart through a wide angle lens, so to speak. The total base typically takes nine to 16 weeks to form, which is longer than what's often seen in other bases.Fourth, remember a stock must climb at least 20% from its latest buy point before the stock can form a new base. The same goes for an ascending base.The buy point on an ascending base is 10 cents past the highest price level of the third pullback.Mattel (MAT) formed an ascending base in 1967.

651,MAT,"Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 financial numbers on Apr 26, after market close.Last quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a huge margin of 523.5%. In fact, Mattel witnessed earnings miss in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 192.7%.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at a loss of 37 cents, which is wider than a loss of 32 cents in the year-ago quarter. Notably, the consensus mark has also witnessed downward revision over the past 30 days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of nearly $694.9 million, down 5.5% from the prior-year quarter.Dismal Sales Run to ContinueWe believe Mattel’s top line will continue to be impacted by challenging sales environment and Toys ""R"" Us bankruptcy in the to-be-reported quarter. In the third and the fourth quarter of 2017, Mattel was particularly affected by Toys ""R"" Us bankruptcy resulting in a decline of revenues and profits year over year.Further, sluggish performance of certain key brands has been hurting the company’s performance. In this context, at the Mattel Girls & Boys Brands, performance of the Other Girls brand has been a matter of concern for quite some time, given the declines in Monster High and Ever After High sales.Although the company heavily relies on a growing pipeline of tech-enabled products that capitalize on new play patterns and allow it to extend beyond traditional toy age ranges, the results is expected to take time. Mattel plans to bring these new-scaled, digitally-connected toy offerings to market beginning in fall 2018.However, on the international front, the company will continue to report robust sales. Since U.S. market is somewhat saturated, toy companies are exploring growth opportunities abroad. In fact, international markets offer greater potential based on the pace of economic growth that they currently enjoy. Particularly, given the fact that emerging markets are expected to be the leading driver of future industry growth, Mattel aims to accelerate its presence therein.Mattel, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Mattel, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Mattel, Inc. QuoteMargins & Earnings to Remain Under PressureThe company’s bottom line is expected to be hurt by rise in operating expenses. Costs related to marketing and promotional initiatives, and for cleaning up inventories coupled with the development of digital platforms are likely to keep margins under pressure, going ahead. Thus, the company pushed out its longer-term target of achieving the low end of the 15-20% operating margin range from 2018 until 2019.Additionally, owing to the Toys ‘R’ Us bankruptcy, the company’s gross margins are likely to decline in the first quarter. In the fourth quarter and 2017, adjusted gross margin contracted to 32% and 38.3% from 47% and 46.8%, respectively. A persistent decline in the top line is likely to result in gross margin contraction due to higher inventory write-downs and discounts offered to clear inventory.Our Quantitative Model Does Not Predict a BeatOur proven model does not show that Mattel is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Mattel has an Earnings ESP of -8.95% and a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).As it is we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings Estimates  Here are two stocks from the Consumer Discretionary sector that investors may consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Boyd Gaming Corporation (BYD  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.44% and a Zacks Rank #3.

652,MAT,"JAKKS Pacific, Inc. (JAKK  -  Free Report), like most other traditional toy makers, has been bearing the brunt of soft consumer demand and a crunch in sales. To navigate such challenges, the Malibu-based toymaker is relying on strategic mergers and joint ventures, collaborating with popular brands and movie franchisees to drive revenues.JAKKS Pacific Gains From Acquisitions & PartnershipsJAKKS Pacific has emerged as a diversified consumer products company, buoyed by a string of acquisitions over the past several years. We consider the company’s ability to successfully identify, close, and integrate acquisitions to be one of its primary competitive advantages. Through innovative partnerships, JAKKS Pacific aims to enter new categories and thereby gain market share in a competitive industry.Meanwhile, the company has collaborations with Disney, Skechers, Nickelodeon, Cabbage Patch Kids and Chico to manufacture toys and merchandise related to these brands. Also, the company’s licensing agreements with popular movie and television franchises like Time Warner’s Cartoon network, Warner Bros. Consumer Products, LAFIG and Sony Pictures Consumer Products, and Universal Pictures are expected to boost sales, as merchandise based on movies enjoys immense popularity. Classic toys based on popular television shows and movies, large-scale figures based on action entertainment and Pre-School toys are liked by kids and are expected to be major top-line growth drivers for the company.Notably, since the beginning of 2017, the company entered into multiple licensing agreements spanning across varied product lines, which hit stores throughout the year. Further, developing products specifically for alternative sales channels — including drug and grocery stores, as well as specialty stores — has proven to be successful with both domestic and international customers.Challenging Retail Environment & Toys ‘R’ Us Fiasco Remain Potential HeadwindsDespite moderate improvement in economic growth, the retail industry for toys continues to experience a sluggish demand. This is because traditional toymakers are facing intense competition from a wide range of alternative entertainment modes like video games, MP3 players, tablets, smartphones and other electronic devices. Continuous competition from technology-based gaming companies is thereby posing a threat to JAKKS Pacific’s market share.Meanwhile, Toys ""R"" Us, United States’ largest independent toy seller, filed for bankruptcy in last September. The company recently confirmed that it is liquidating its entire U.S. operations (735 Toys ""R"" Us and Babies ""R"" Us stores). Liquidation sales started on Mar 23.With this chain going out of business, the industry is expected to grow at a much slower pace for quite some time. JAKKS Pacific, along with its famous peers like Hasbro (HAS  -  Free Report) and Mattel (MAT  -  Free Report) will be affected, as a considerable portion of their revenues were generated from sales to Toys ""R"" Us.JAKKS Pacific, being a smaller player among its peers, will be hit harder because existing retailers like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) are likely to give preference to established brands in their limited shelf space. Further, Toys ""R"" Us’ exit will hurt innovation in the industry as it was the only major toy seller that promoted new products.Meanwhile, shares of JAKKS Pacific have lost 57.9% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 22.5%. Also, the company has incurred losses in nine of the trailing 12 quarters. Given the challenging retail environment for toys, we remain doubtful about much improvement in the stock's performance.Zacks RankJAKKS Pacific carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

653,MAT,"Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report), which remains focused on achieving cost savings, announced shutting down of its New York office. This latest move is a part of the company’s $650 million cost savings initiatives undertaken in 2017.Per media report, as the New York office will be closed in phases it is likely to hamper nearly 100 employees. Also, Mattel plans to reshape its operations for transforming into a faster and smarter organization. To this end, in 2017, the company had stated that it expects to eliminate at least $650 million in net costs over the next two years (up from $150-$200 million estimated earlier) through portfolio simplification, organization realignment and an optimized number of product launches.The company will thus be focusing on three key areas — commercial side of the business, manufacturing and supply chain, and IT transformation — to bring about the desired change.Miles to go Before Investors Bet on MattelIn the past year, shares of this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company have declined 49.1% against the industry’s gain of 21.1%. This underperformance is likely to continue in the coming quarters. Stocks such as Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report), Glu Mobile Inc. (GLUU  -  Free Report) and Nintendo Co., Ltd. (NTDOY  -  Free Report), which belong to the same industry, have witnessed a sharp gain of 34.1%, 60.7% and 81.9%, respectively, in a year. Additionally, lack of innovative schemes for brand awareness and brand innovation has been hurting the company’s revenues and POS momentum. Though overall POS has been mostly positive owing to the company’s efforts to lower retail inventories, the improvement is not broad based. We need to wait for more consistent progress at all its brands.Tighter retail inventory management also significantly affected Mattel’s fourth-quarter sales and might continue hurting revenues, going forward. Notably, the company began the year 2017 by expecting mid-to-high single-digit growth in full-year gross sales but ended the year with high single-digit decline in the same. The decrease in gross sales can be attributed to tighter retail inventory management and underperformance by major brands.Further, costs related to marketing and promotional initiatives, cleaning up inventories and development of digital platforms are likely to keep margins under pressure, moving ahead. Therefore, the company pushed out its longer-term target of achieving the low end of the 15-20% operating margin range from 2018 until 2019.Also, Toys “R” Us, a significant U.S. toymaker, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, given increasing headwinds such as huge debt and heightening competition. The bankruptcy adversely impacted Mattel’s third and fourth-quarter 2017 revenues, generating almost 10% of overall sales from the toymaker.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

654,MAT,"Investing success depends upon proper identification of overhyped toxic stocks and the correctly priced ones. However, spotting toxic stocks on time and discarding them to make profit is not an easy task.Overpriced toxic stocks are generally susceptible to external shocks. Additionally, these stocks are loaded with huge debts. The price of the toxic stocks is artificially inflated. However, the higher price of toxic stocks is only short-term in nature as it exceeds its true intrinsic value.Investors may profit from proper identification of toxic stocks with the help of an investing strategy called short selling. This strategy permits investors to sell a stock first and then buy it when the price falls.While short selling excels in bear markets, it typically loses money in bull markets.So, identifying toxic stocks and abandoning or short selling them at the right time is the key to shield your portfolio from big losses.Screening CriteriaHere is a winning strategy that will help you to identify overpriced toxic stocks:Most recent Debt/Equity Ratio greater than the median industry average: High debt/equity ratio implies high leverage. High leverage indicates a huge level of repayment that the company has to make in connection with the debt amount.P/E using 12-month forward EPS estimate greater than 50: A very high forward P/E implies that a stock is highly overvalued.% Change in F (1) and F (2) Estimate (12 Weeks) less than 0: Negative EPS estimate revision for this and the next fiscal year during the past 12 weeks points to analysts’ pessimism.Zacks Rank more than or equal to #3 (Hold): We have not considered Buy-rated stocks that generally outperform the market.Here are five of the 19 toxic stocks that showed up on the screen:Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.

Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Mattel shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company?

Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while four have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from a loss of 29 cents per share to a loss of 36 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Mattel right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing.

657,MAT,"The U.S. toy industry was taken by surprise when the country’s largest independent toy seller, Toys ""R"" Us filed for bankruptcy in September last year. The company recently confirmed that it is liquidating its entire U.S. operations (735 Toys ""R"" Us and Babies ""R"" Us stores). Liquidation sales started on Mar 23.Toys ""R"" Us failed to keep up with fast changing customer preferences and shift of demand toward alternative entertainment modes like video games, MP3 players, tablets, smartphones and other electronic devices.It simply could not compete on price and shopping convenience with giants like Amazonand Walmart. To make matters worse, the company was burdened with a $5 billion debt load, much of which originated from its 2005 deal to go private. All these developments gradually pushed it toward bankruptcy.Will the Industry Suffer? It will, certainly. With the last major chain fully dedicated to selling toys going out of business, we expect the industry to grow at a much slower pace for quite some time.Big toymakers such as Mattel (MAT  -  Free Report) and Hasbro (HAS  -  Free Report) as well as smaller players like JAKKS Pacific (JAKK  -  Free Report) will be affected as a considerable portion of their revenues were generated from sales to Toys ""R"" Us. Retailers like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) will surely come to their rescue, but the only problem is that they currently don’t have shelf spaces as big as Toys “R” Us.Smaller players will be hit harder because, unlike Toys ""R"" Us, the existing retailers are likely to give preference to established brands in their limited shelf space. Further, Toys ""R"" Us’ exit will hurt innovation in the industry as it was the only major toy seller promoted new products.Last year, the company sold, roughly one-fifth of the toys in the United States, generating more than $11 billion in revenues. According to Jefferies analyst Stephanie Wissink, while 85% to 90% of Toys ""R"" Us' volume would be redistributed by the second half of the year, there’s no surety about the remaining 10 to 15%. This portion of the purchase was incidental and may not shift to other channels.A Death Blow to Hasbro?Well, we hope not. Hasbro has been trying to curb its dependence on Toys “R” Us since the latter’s Chapter 11 filing. It has been testing waters with new distribution methods, developing digital play components and exploring ventures with other industries.The company has diverse retail channels such as dollar stores, drug stores, and big mass market retail. It also has a robust online strategy in place that includes interactive content and virtual immersive experiences.It has a five-year agreement with Paramount to enhance storytelling and content capabilities. The company also invested in Boulder Media, its animation studio, and increased digital capacities to drive sales.Hasbro continues to release Transformers franchise products in all forms of entertainment, including movies, television and digital expressions. Given the company’s several innovative and productive plans for Transformers franchise over the next 10 years, revenues are expected to grow.Moreover, the deal with Walt Disney to manufacture dolls based on Disney Princess stories and characters is expected to boost Hasbro’s top line.We believe that with these initiatives in place, Hasbro is well positioned than others to witness incremental revenues, thus mitigating the impact of Toys ""R"" Us exit.Last year, Hasbro generated 9% of its overall sales from Toys “R” Us and the latter has unpaid bills of $59 million with Hasbro.Hasbro, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Hasbro, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Hasbro, Inc. QuoteWhat About Mattel?Lack of innovative schemes for brand awareness and brand innovation have been hurting the company’s revenues and point of sale (POS) momentum and the Toys “R” Us bankruptcy has surely compounded its woes.The company has been slow to react to deteriorating sales of its flagship product, Barbie and has hardly taken any measure to reduce reliance on U.S. sales. Mattel saw multiple CEO changes in recent years and lost Disney Princess and Frozen lines to Hasbro.Mattel will be much worse hit than Hasbro as Toys “R” Us handled between 15% and 20% of the company's domestic sales, and 11% of sales globally. Moreover, Toys “R” Us owes more than $135 million to Mattel and chances of recovery are scant.Mattel, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Mattel, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Mattel, Inc. QuoteMerger in the Cards?Possibilities of a merger cannot be ignored. The impact of Toys “R” Us is strong enough to sustain speculations that Mattel may have to entertain a merger offer from Hasbro.There also remains a strong probability of mergers and acquisitions of smaller toymakers as they are the ones to be more affected by the liquidation. Hasbro, being the world’s largest toymaker, is best positioned to go for an acquisition.To ConcludeHasbro has been one of the early movers to gauge the impacts of Toys “R” Us bankruptcy while Mattel was slow to react. Hasbro has been adapting rapidly to changing market conditions while Mattel has fallen behind. Though the bankruptcy has increased challenges for both companies, we expect that Hasbro’s counter strategies will help it come through unharmed.On the other hand, Mattel is already in big trouble and only a well-planned strategic move (a turnaround or getting acquired) could shore up the company's flagging fortunes.Zacks RankWhile Hasbro carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Mattel has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

Their portfolio includes Barbie, Hot Wheels, Monster High, American Girl, Thomas & Friends and Fisher-Price brands. They employ approximately 32,000 people in 40 countries and sell products in more than 150 countries.Weak Results Lead to Falling Estimates The company reported weak results for Q4, missing on both the top and bottom lines. Adjusted loss of 72 cents per share was significantly short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 17 cents.This was the fifth consecutive miss for the toymaker.Toys ‘R’ Us LiquidationToys ‘R’ Us—one of the biggest sellers of Mattel’s Barbie dolls--filed for liquidation of its US operation earlier this month. It also plans to sell its businesses in some other countries. This is a major blow to toy makers like Mattel.With its 700 stores, Toys “R” Us accounted for about one-fifth of toy sales in the US. According to WSJ, Toys “R” Us’ owed Mattel $136 million in September when it filed for bankruptcy.Further, its demise will leave US Toymakers without a “national partner to showcase its wares year-round, test experimental products and find the next Shopkins or ZhuZhu Pet.”Mass retailers like Walmart and Target choose to focus on top-selling toys, whereas Toys “R” Us takes risks with newer toys to discover the next big thing.Mattel shares fell more than 7% after the report. According to analysts, the impact is expected to be larger on Mattel than Hasbro.The Bottom LineMattel has seen weak sales for the past many quarters as they struggle with kids’ rising preference for videogames and smartphone applications.Additionally, they are losing in competition with Hasbro after Disney selected Hasbro for the Disney Princess and Frozen franchises.

661,MAT,"Successful investing depends upon accurate identification of overpriced toxic stocks and rightly priced ones. However, figuring out the toxic stocks on time and abandoning them to make some profits is not an easy task. Overblown toxic stocks are usually vulnerable to outside shocks. Additionally, these stocks are burdened with huge debts. The price of toxic stocks is artificially inflated. However, the higher price of toxic stocks is only transitory in nature as it is higher than its true intrinsic value.Investors may gain from accurate identification of toxic stocks with the help of an investing strategy called short selling. This strategy permits investors to sell a stock first and then buy it when the price falls.While short selling excels in bear markets, it typically loses money in bull markets.So, spotting toxic stocks and discarding or short selling them at the right time is the key to protect your portfolio from big losses.Screening CriteriaHere is a winning strategy that will help you to identify overpriced toxic stocks:Most recent Debt/Equity Ratio greater than the median industry average: High debt/equity ratio implies high leverage. High leverage indicates a huge level of repayment that the company has to make in connection with the debt amount.P/E using 12-month forward EPS estimate greater than 50: A very high forward P/E implies that a stock is highly overvalued.% Change in F (1) and F (2) Estimate (12 Weeks) less than 0: Negative EPS estimate revision for this and the next fiscal year during the past 12 weeks points to analysts’ pessimism.Zacks Rank more than or equal to #3 (Hold): We have not considered Buy-rated stocks that generally outperform the market.Here are five of the 25 toxic stocks that showed up on the screen:El Segundo, CA-based Mattel, Inc.

662,MAT,"Shares of JAKKS Pacific, Inc. (JAKK  -  Free Report) are riding high on strategic mergers and joint ventures, collaboration with popular brands and movie franchisees. Moreover, efforts to enter new categories, and create a solid portfolio of new and existing licenses bode well. Evidently, the stock has surged 45.5% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s 15.7% rally. Stocks such as Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report), Hasbro, Inc. (HAS  -  Free Report) and Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report), which belong to the same industry, has also gained 14%, 9.1% and 25.6%, respectively, in the same time frame.Let’s delve deeper and find out the reasons that have kept this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company ahead of its peers. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Hidden CatalystsJAKKS Pacific has emerged as a diversified consumer products company buoyed by a string of acquisitions over the past few years.  We consider the company’s ability to successfully identify, close, and integrate acquisitions to be one of its primary competitive advantages. It continues to leverage from the acquisitions of Maui, Inc. and the joint ventures with Meisheng Culture & Creative Corp., NantWorks LLC and DHX Brands. Through such innovative partnerships JAKKS Pacific intends to enter new categories and gain market share in a competitive industry.Notably, since the beginning of 2017, JAKKS Pacific entered into multiple licensing agreements spanning across varied product lines, which have been hitting stores throughout the year. Furthermore, developlment of product specifically for alternative sales channels — including drug and grocery stores as well as specialty stores — has proved conducive to domestic and international customers.Also, JAKKS Pacific remains committed toward expanding its footprint outside the United States. Consistent with its endeavors, the company has opened sales offices and expanded distribution agreements for its products. Since management expects to benefit from geographical expansion, it started full-fledged operations at its newest sales office in Germany and France last year.Meanwhile, its partnership with Meisheng is expected to result in solid growth across Asia. After launching Tsum Tsum in key international markets like Latin America and Asia, the company plans to expand its distribution in new territories moving ahead. These expansion initiatives are likely to strengthen its international presence and customer base, which in turn, should boost sales growth, profit margins and the company’s access to attract licenses.Moreover, JAKKS Pacific has regularly brought in novelty in its products to cope with the changing play pattern of children and boost demand. Recently, demand for physical toys has been declining due to younger children’s preference for digital games and other electronic learning tools. Consistent with this trend, the company has also introduced a number of mobile gaming apps and digital games besides the physical toys, which may help it cash in on the demand for smartphone gaming. In addition, JAKKS Pacific is taking initiatives to connect with  customers through digital videos, display banners and social ads, which are likely to improve customer experience. Such investment in digital innovation should help the company in brand building apart from allowing it to capitalize on lucrative technology-based gaming market.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

663,MAT,"Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report) has been losing sheen of late. Not exempting the current fate of toymakers in the United States, the company is plagued with declining consumer demand and sales crunch.Notably, Mattel had suspended its quarterly dividend of 15 cents per share starting in the fourth quarter of 2017 to augment financial flexibility, fortify balance sheet and facilitate strategic investments. The dividend suspension is not going down well with investors and is in turn hurting the company’s share-price performance.A look at Mattel’s price trend reveals that the stock has had an unimpressive run on the bourses in the past year. Shares of the company have lost 17.3% against the industry’s rally of 21.3% in the same time frame. This reflects investors’ pessimism on the stock, given uncertain sales environment. Moreover, over the past two months, earnings estimates for the current quarter and year have been revised downward, reflecting analysts’ doubt surrounding the company’s future earnings potential.Toys ‘R’ Us Woes Likely to LingerThe U.S. toy industry was dealt a heavy blow when the country’s largest independent toy seller, Toys ""R"" Us filed for bankruptcy last September. Adding a nail to the coffin, Toys “R” US said that it is liquidating its U.S. operations, leaving toymakers like Hasbro (HAS  -  Free Report), Mattel and JAKK Pacific (JAKK  -  Free Report) in a mess as they used to derive a considerable portion of their revenues from sales to Toys ""R"" Us. Although retailers like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) had come to rescue these toymakers, they currently don’t have shelf spaces as big as Toys “R” Us, which is a concern.In fact, owing to the liquidation, Mattel’s net revenues in the first quarter of 2018 declined 7% year over year on a constant-currency basis. It also resulted in sales slump across Mattel’s every brand. We believe that effect of this liquidation will linger further as Toys “R” Us was the last major chain fully dedicated to selling toys and the overall industry is expected to grow at a much slower pace for quite some time.Dismal Sales Environment to ContinueSluggish performance of a few key brands has been hurting the company’s performance. In this context, at the Mattel Girls & Boys Brands, performance of the Other Girls brand has been a matter of concern for quite some time, given declines in Monster High and Ever After High sales.Although the company heavily relies on a growing pipeline of tech-enabled products that capitalize on new play patterns and allow it to extend beyond traditional toys for younger age groups, positive outcome from such strategies are expected to take time.Also, lack of innovative schemes for brand awareness and innovation has been hurting the company’s revenues and POS momentum. Though overall POS has been mostly positive owing to the company’s efforts to lower retail inventories, the improvement is not broad based. We need to wait for more consistent progress of all its brands.Subsequently, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues are likely to fall 3% in 2018 compared with the prior year.Margins Likely to Continue Hurting EarningsA rise in operating expenses is expected to hurt Mattel’s bottom line. Meanwhile, tighter retail inventory management significantly affected Mattel’s first-quarter 2018 sales and may continue to hamper revenues, going forward. Moreover, due to a simplified cost-savings initiative that included write-downs of excess owned inventory and impairment of assets, the company’s adjusted gross margin in 2017 fell 850 basis points and is likely to be further impacted in the short term. Further, costs related to marketing and promotional initiatives, and for cleaning up inventories coupled with the development of digital platforms are likely to keep margins under pressure, going forward. Thus, the company pushed out its longer-term target of achieving the low end of the 15-20% operating margin range from 2018 until 2019.Currently, Mattel carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).(You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.)The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

664,MAT,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in MAT.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen four estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from earnings of 5 cents a share a month ago to its current level of a loss of 16 cents.Also, for the current quarter, Mattel has seen four downward estimate revisions versus no revision in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 22 cents a share from 41 cents over the past 30 days.   The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 15% in the past month.Mattel, Inc.

665,MAT,"Hasbro Inc.’s (HAS  -  Free Report) strong product line up of entertainment backed products along with focus on strategic partnerships pose the company for long-term growth. However, higher costs and lower demand for traditional toys are somewhat denting the company’s profit.Last month, Hasbro reported mixed fourth-quarter 2017 results, with earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues lagging the same. Adjusted earnings of $2.30 per share surpassed the consensus mark of $1.82 by 26.4%. Earnings grew 40.2% from the year-ago quarter, driven by benefits from the recent U.S. tax reforms.In the fourth quarter, revenues from its Partner Brands and Europe declined, significantly affecting net revenues. However, strength in the franchise brand revenues drove the top line. Management believes that product innovation and digital initiatives will help the company gain traction in 2018 and beyond.However, costs related to such initiatives would hurt the company’s margins in the near term.Notably, shares of Hasbro have lost 7.3% in the past year, widely underperforming the industry’s gain of 37.9%. Moreover, given management’s lowered guidance for 2018, based largely on negative overall industry trends, we find the stock’s upside potential to be limited.Product Launch, Strategic Partnerships & Strong Brand-Building Efforts Aid Top LineTo drive revenues, Hasbro continues to invest in relentless product innovation. The company continues to release Transformers Franchise in all forms of entertainment, including movies, television and digital expressions, which are expected to drive the top line in the coming 10 years.On the product innovation front, Hasbro launched several social games. Among them, Dungeons & Dragons was particularly successful. With the launch of DROPMIX, the company further strengthened its digital gaming revenues. Product innovation remains a strong driver of sales growth for Hasbro.Meanwhile, the company is continuously signing partnership deals with social, digital and television platforms to enhance sales. Hasbro entered into a five-year agreement with Paramount to enhance storytelling and content capabilities. It further invested in Boulder Media, the company’s animation studio and increased digital capacities to drive sales. Moreover, the deal with Walt Disney to manufacture dolls based on Disney Princess’ stories and characters, beginning 2016, is expected to continue bolstering Hasbro’s top line.Hasbro continues to increase its brand awareness through television. Hasbro Studio is responsible for the creation and development of storytelling based on Hasbro’s brands, across mediums including television, film and digital shorts. The television programming is currently aired worldwide.Hasbro has 40% interest in a joint venture with Discovery Communications called the Discovery Family Channel (formerly known as ‘The Hub Network’). This network offers high-quality children’s shows as well as family entertainment and educational programs. In international markets, Hasbro Studios distribute to various broadcasters and cable networks on various digital platforms, including Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and iTunes. These initiatives are aiding the company to achieve its target of growing the brands beyond traditional toys and games, and providing entertainment to consumers of all ages, thereby boosting demand and sales.Toys ‘R’ Us Bankruptcy Remains a Major HeadwindThe Toys ‘R’ Us Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in September, 2017 has been an added concern for the already suffering toy industry players. The bankruptcy continues to affect Hasbro, as well as other significant toymakers like Mattel (MAT  -  Free Report) and JAKKS Pacific (JAKK  -  Free Report), as each of these companies generate almost 10% of their overall sales from Toys “R” Us.In fact, Hasbro’s U.S. and Canada segment’s fourth-quarter 2017 revenues and operating profit were dented due to the incremental bad debt expense related to the bankruptcy filing. The segment’s operating profit in 2017 declined 2% to $509.9 million.Zacks RankHasbro carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

666,MAT,"Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report) is grappling with the impacts of Toys “R” Us bankruptcy, sluggish performance of brands and pressure on margins.The company’s fourth-quarter 2017 results missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the earnings and revenues front. Both the metrics also declined significantly on a year-over-year basis.Additionally, Mattel has a dismal surprise history with the company missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the last four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 192.68%.In a year’s time, the company’s shares have lost 34.6% against the industry’s gain of 38.4%. Toys ‘R’ Us Bankruptcy Continues to Hurt RevenuesThe Toys ‘R’ Us’ Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in September, 2017 has been an added concern for the already suffering toy industry players. Mattel’s gross sales decreased 9% in 2017 compared with the 2016 figure. Reversal of roughly $47 million of gross sales associated with Toys ""R"" Us bankruptcy filing led to the decline.Mattel, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Mattel, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Mattel, Inc. Quote Major Brands Continue to UnderperformContinual sluggish performance of key brands is another strong reason behind decline of revenues in 2017. In fact, Mattel’s all the major brands have witnessed a decline in gross sales in the year compared with 2016. While revenues at Mattel Girls & Boys Brands declined 4%, the same at Fisher-Price Brands, American Girl Brands and Construction and Arts & Crafts Brands were down 11%, 21% and 29%, respectively.Margins Remain Under PressureDue to a simplified cost savings initiative that included write-downs of excess owned inventory and impairment of assets, the company’s adjusted gross margin contracted 850 basis points (bps) in 2017.Moving ahead, costs related to marketing and promotional initiatives, and cleaning up inventories coupled with the development of digital platforms are likely to keep margins under pressure. Thus, the company pushed out its longer-term target of achieving the low end of the 15-20% operating margin range from 2018 until 2019.To ConcludeAlthough the company continues to make strategic investments in its brands and focus on improving its point of sales (POS), it will take some time for all the brands to show consistent improvement. However, given the strong product line-up that includes core brands, licensed brands and lucrative product associations, Mattel remains well positioned for growth in the long term.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderMattel carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the Consumer Discretionary sector are Monarch Casino & Resort (MCRI  -  Free Report), Las Vegas Sands (LVS  -  Free Report) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN  -  Free Report), all carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

668,MAT,"Mattel Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is the worldwide leader in the design, manufacture and marketing of toys and family products. The Mattel family is comprised of such best-selling brands as Barbie, the most popular fashion doll ever introduced, Hot Wheels, Matchbox, American Girl, Radica and Hot Wheels RC, as well as Fisher-Price brands, including Thomas & Friends, Little People, Power Wheels and a wide array of entertainment-inspired toy lines.Recent Earnings DataThe company recently reported Q4 earnings where they significantly missed both the Zacks consensus earnings and revenue estimates.  Further, the report also showed that quarterly net sales fell by -12%, and gross margins declined by -8% on a year over year basis.  Specifically, gross margins saw a big dip, falling to 32% vs. 47% in Q4 16.  On a regional basis, North American sales dropped by -17%, and gross sales fell by -16% YoY.  Management cited tighter retail inventory, certain underperforming brands, and the Toys “R” Us bankruptcy filing as the reasons for the decline.  On the International side, net sales dropped by -9% while gross sales fell by -1% in constant currency.  The reasons given for the international decline were higher freight and logistics expenses, and unfavorable product mix.   Future OutlookWhile the holiday season results were disappointing, management is attempting to turn the company around.  Mattel can continued to build on two successful areas; the Barbie brand that saw shipments increases by 9%, and the company’s overall improvement in its inventory retail position.  Further, management is currently accelerating its cost reduction efforts.  But the issue of visibility remains, so it is not clear when and how successful its turnaround plan will positively impact both the top and bottom lines.   Management’s TakeAccording to Margo Georgiadis, CEO, “We have taken aggressive action to enter 2018 with a clean slate so that we can reset our economic model and rapidly improve profitability. We are optimistic about stabilizing revenue in 2018 anchored by our key power brands, entertainment partnerships and exciting new launches. We continue to gain momentum toward the medium-term goals we shared at our June Investor Day.”Price and Earnings Consensus GraphAs you can see in the graph below the stock price has been falling since the beginning of 2017, and future earnings estimates have declined as well.Mattel, Inc.

670,MAT,"Hasbro, Inc.’s (HAS  -  Free Report) unremitting efforts to develop its product line through various partnerships and innovations have been helping the company gain market share amid all operating difficulties. The company’s focus on growing its brands beyond familiar itineraries to the emerging markets is also encouraging.However, there is no denial of the fact that the company has been losing sheen of late. Not exempting the current fate of toymakers in the United States, Hasbro is plagued with declining consumer demand and sales crunch. A look at the toymaker’s price trend reveals that the stock has had an unimpressive run on the bourses in the past year. Shares of the company have lost 18.6% against the industry’s rally of 20.1% in the same time frame. This reflects investors’ pessimism on the stock, given uncertain sales environment. Also, earnings estimates for the current quarter and year have remained stable over the past month, reflecting analysts’ doubt surrounding the company’s future earnings potential.Efforts to Revive Sales, Assessing the Impact of Toys ‘R’ USThe U.S. toy industry suffered a heavy blow when the country’s largest independent toy seller, Toys ""R"" Us filed for bankruptcy last September. Adding a nail to the coffin, Toys “R” US said that it is liquidating its entire U.S. operation, leaving toymakers like Hasbro, Mattel (MAT  -  Free Report) and JAKK Pacific (JAKK  -  Free Report) in a soup as these used to derive a considerable portion of their revenues from sales to Toys ""R"" Us. Although retailers like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) came to the rescue of these toymakers, they don’t have shelf spaces as big as Toys “R” Us, which is a concern.We appreciate Hasbro’s prescience in rightly gauging the impact of Toys “R” Us bankruptcy ahead of peers. The company has been testing waters with new distribution methods, development of digital-play components and exploration of ventures with other industries. The company has diverse retail channels such as drugstores and dollar chains, and big mass-market retail. It also has a robust online strategy in place that includes interactive content and virtual immersive experiences. It signed a five-year agreement with Paramount to enhance storytelling and content capabilities. The company also invested in Boulder Media, its animation studio, and cultivated digital capacities to drive sales.Over the past month, Hasbro announced several partnership and innovative ventures, all of which indicate the company’s efforts to diversify revenues beyond retail sales, and expand customer base. After partnering with Quidd and acquiring Power Rangers, the company declared its multi-year partnership with the comedy duo Rhett & Link, which is expected to boost the popularity of Hasbro’s games.Growth in Emerging Markets Bodes WellIn addition to growing brands, and leveraging opportunistic toy lines and licenses, Hasbro seeks to grow its international business by expanding into emerging markets in Eastern Europe, Asia,and Latin and South America. Emerging markets offer greater opportunities for revenue growth than developed markets and have been contributing to a significant share of Hasbro’s revenues, given its investments in advertising, and other brand-building efforts.In fact, despite difficult operating conditions in some key markets, Hasbro’s emerging market revenues (excluding Fx impact) have been increasing consistently since 2012, a trend that is expected to continue in 2018 as well. Over the next few years, Hasbro expects emerging markets to grow in double digits backed by innovation in products, entertainment and market-share gains. Also, developed markets can grow from low to mid-single digits, as is expected by the toymaker.Toys ‘R’ Us Woes Likely to LingerWell, while we appreciate Hasbro’s relentless efforts to chalk out counter strategies and adapt to changing demand conditions, we remain apprehensive about the fact that Hasbro has not been able to revive sales yet. In fact, owing to the liquidation, sales of Hasbro across every brand declined in the first quarter of 2018. We believe that the effect of this liquidation will linger further, as Toys “R” Us was the last major chain fully dedicated to selling toys.Rising Costs Affect ProfitsHasbro has been heavily relying on partnerships, mergers, product innovation and digital invention to revive sales. While such initiatives may aid profits in the long run, related costs would hurt the company in the near term. As it is, selling, distribution and administration expenses, as a percentage of net revenues, increased to 45.8% in the first quarter of 2018 from 28.7% in the prior-year quarter. These costs in turn are hurting the company’s earnings. Subsequently, per the consensus estimate, earningsare likely to fall 11.5% in 2018 from the previous year.Currently, Hasbro carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

By collaborating with the duo, Hasbro aims to co-develop and uphold unique gamesand events. Also, Rhett & Link, having more than 21 million subscribers, can provide Hasbro with a platform that will showcase the company’s unique product line.Vigorous Partnershipsarethe Need of the HourThe collaboration with Rhett & Link falls under Hasbro’s strategy of extending partnerships, and focusing on greater distribution of its iconic products to drive incremental sales. As it is, Rhett & Link is highly popular owing to its YouTube comedy series, Good Mythical Morning. The comedy duo recorded more than 5 billion views since its video debut in 2006.

672,MAT,"As Christmas is just around the corner, investors might take more interest in the toys and games space. The holiday season usually marks the most profitable time of the year for the industry, with the second half of the year accounting for two-thirds of net sales.As per the latest report from The NPD Group, Inc. an American market research company, the U.S. toy industry saw a 3% rise in its dollar sales in the first nine months of 2017. As per a July report by the NPD Group, sales are estimated to grow approximately 4.5% in the full year. Also, the release of popular flicks like Star Wars: The Last Jedi is likely to fuel industry growth.However, leading U.S. toymakers like Hasbro, Inc. (HAS  -  Free Report), Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report) and JAKKS Pacific, Inc. (JAKK  -  Free Report) do not conform to the overall rosy industry background. Here’s why —Toy companies like Hasbro have been grappling with declining demand for traditional toys for quite some time now.The recent Toys ‘R’ Us bankruptcy aggravated matters. The company saw a decline in quarterly revenues and operating profits in the third quarter. Hasbro had been selling roughly 9% of its total inventory at the chain. The bankruptcy filing could have left the company with $60 million worth of unsecured payments. In fact, it has disrupted Hasbro’s growth plans for the holiday and has even paused shipments for a short period.  Resultantly, the company expects fourth-quarter revenue growth in the range of 4% to 7% year over year, lower than its earlier projections.We note that, with a market capitalization of $11.94 billion, Hasbro is on investors’ radar owing to its size and liquidity. The company’s earnings estimate revisions clearly reflect the disappointment among investors regarding the stock’s prospects. Over the past 60 days, current-quarter and year earnings estimates have gone down 8.9% and 1.2%, respectively.Further, shares of the company have underperformed the industry year to date. The stock has gained 23.2% as compared with the industry’s growth of 44.6%.However, in order to navigate the macro challenges, Hasbro focuses on innovation in products and major theatrical releases. Increased focus on gaming and strategic partnerships continues to be this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s key growth drivers.Mattel, the largest toy retailer in the United States, foresees a weak holiday season as revealed in a recent regulatory filing. Despite owning prominent brands like Barbie, Fisher-Price and Fijit Friends, Mattel expects at least mid-to-high single-digit decline in 2017 sales compared to 2016.The company is anxious about its key retail partners opting for tighter inventory management. Moreover, Toy Box-related challenges and certain underperforming brands are likely to dent the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, Mattel has been particularly affected by the Toys ‘R’ Us bankruptcy as it resulted in a year-over-year decline in third-quarter 2017 revenues and profits. In fact, since the company’s gross margins included the associated cost of goods sold, the net sales reversal in Toys ‘R’ Us accounted for approximately one-fifth of the year-over-year decline in gross margin. The effect of the bankruptcy is expected to linger in the upcoming quarters as well.The company reported a 620 basis points (bps) year-over-year decline in gross margins in the first nine months of 2017. This decline, owing to unfavorable product mix, higher freight and logistics expenses and lower fixed cost absorption, is expected to reflect in fourth-quarter 2017 results as well. A persistent decline in the top line is likely to result in gross margin deterioration due to higher inventory write-downs and discounts offered to clear inventory.Meanwhile, over last 60 days, earnings estimates for the current quarter have gone down 30.8%. The consensus estimate for the bottom line has declined from earnings to loss for the current-year in the same time period. Also, year to date, shares of the company have lost 41.4% as against the industry’s gain.Hence, this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company, which generally rakes in about 40% of its annual sales during Christmas, is likely to face a decline in sales and margins owing to the above-mentioned dampeners.JAKKS Pacific has also been bearing the brunt of declining demand for traditional toys. The bankruptcy also compelled the company to slash its 2017 guidance. JAKKS Pacific expects to incur a net loss and record negative earnings per share in the full year. Also, though the company continues to expect positive EBITDA for the year, the figure is anticipated to decline year over year. Though the company expects Toys ‘R’ Us to be a healthier retailer 2018 onward, the near-term effects of the bankruptcy and consequent pause in shipments might hamper JAKKS Pacific’s performance.We note that over the last 60 days, the consensus estimate for the bottom line has declined from earnings to loss for current quarter and year.Also, year to date, shares of the company have lost 50.5%, widely underperforming the industry.JAKKS Pacific carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Even though the above-mentioned stocks are likely to dampen investor sentiments, a look at Nintendo Co., Ltd. (NTDOY  -  Free Report) can be comforting. The company sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and its current-year earnings are expected to increase 112.8% year over year.

673,MAT,"We are in the thick of the Q4 earnings season with 251 of the S&P 500 members having released their quarterly numbers (as of Feb 2) and another 92 scheduled to report.Per the latest Earnings Preview, 80.5% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported have surpassed earnings estimates, 78.1% beat revenue estimates and 64.9% outpaced both earnings and revenues.Further, total earnings for these companies have increased 16% from the same period last year on 10.5% higher revenues. The report projects a 13% year-over-year rise in earnings for the S&P 500 companies with total revenues likely to increase 7.7%. This compares favorably with the year-over-year increase of 6.7% and 5.9% for earnings and revenues, respectively, in the third quarter.A Mixed Bag for Consumer DiscretionaryWhile a few sectors are expected to put up a stellar show, the widely diversified Consumer Discretionary sector is likely to post mixed results.Total earnings for the sector are likely to decline 3.7% year over year against 0.9% growth in the last quarter. Total revenues are projected to grow 3.7% year over year in Q4, slightly higher than the 3.5% growth recorded in the preceding quarter. Margins in the quarter are likely to decline 0.8% from the year-ago quarter, comparing unfavorably with the prior quarter’s decline of 0.3%.The Toys - Games – Hobbies Industry under consumer discretionary is expected to have recorded growth in Q4 on rising demand for entertainment services, including video games. The industry performed remarkably well in the past year gaining 49.8%, outpacing the S&P 500’s 21.1%.Traditional Toy Makers in a FixToy companies have been grappling with declining demand for traditional toys for quite some time now. Pressure from the recent Toys ‘R’ Us bankruptcy have affected their third-quarter results and might have dented growth in Q4 as well. As a result, we have seen Mattel (MAT  -  Free Report) report fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted loss of 72 cents per share, comparing unfavorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the prior quarter’s earnings. Net sales also missed the consensus mark and declined year over year.Meanwhile, another leading U.S. toymaker Hasbro (HAS  -  Free Report) is expected to deliver strong revenues and earnings owing to the company’s efforts to counter the prevailing challenges in the operating environment. The company is expected to report its quarterly results on Feb 7.The consensus estimate for Q4 earnings is pegged at $1.82, mirroring nearly 11% year-over-year growth. We believe that this growth is attributable to the company’s efficient cost structure coupled with various sales-boosting efforts in some key markets.Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.73 billion, reflecting 6.4% year-over-year growth. The projected sales growth is primarily backed by strong performance of the company’s Franchise Brands, Partner Brand, Hasbro Gaming and Emerging Brand. Also, entertainment initiatives and higher consumer product sales are likely to drive revenues.However, the Toys ‘R’ Us bankruptcy will keep Hasbro’s top line under pressure. The bankruptcy disrupted the company’s growth plans in Q4 and had even paused shipments for a short period. Taking the adverse impacts into account, the company has slashed its Q4 revenue growth guidance to a range of 4% to 7%.

Declines in Thomas & Friends and infant products hampered the results.Gross sales at American Girl Brands were $217.3 million, down 23% from the year-ago quarter as reported and on a constant-currency basis primarily due to lower sales across channels.Gross sales at Construction and Arts & Crafts Brands, which includes the Mega Bloks and RoseArt brands, were $93.5 million, down 25% from fourth-quarter 2016 as reported (down 26% at constant currency).

675,MAT,"Shares of Mattel Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report) declined nearly 5% in afterhours trading on Jul 27, after the company reported weak results in the second quarter of 2017.Earnings & Revenue DiscussionMattel’s adjusted loss per share of 14 cents was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 8 cents. Also, the incurred loss was wider than the prior-year quarter loss of 2 cents.Notably, revenues of $974.5 million rose 2% year over year as reported and 3% in constant currency. However, sales failed to surpass the consensus mark of $1 billion by nearly 3%. Higher sales of ""Cars 3"" products failed to offset weak demand for its key brands such as American Girl, Barbie and Fisher-Price.Quarter HighlightsWorldwide gross sales were up 1% year over year as reported and 2% in constant currency.Gross sales in North America (including the U.S., Canada and American Girl) declined 2% as reported and in constant currency. Meanwhile, in the International region, gross sales increased 6% year over year (up 8% on a constant currency basis).Notably, gross margin decreased 430 bps to 41% from 45.3% recorded in the year-ago quarter. This was due to higher royalty expense, unfavorable product mix, lower licensing income and higher product costs.Moreover, adjusted operating loss for the quarter was $40.1 million comparing unfavorably with the prior-year quarter operating income of $6.2 million.Mattel, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Mattel, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Mattel, Inc. QuoteWorldwide Revenues by BrandMattel, through its subsidiaries, sells a broad variety of toy products that are grouped into four major brand categories: Mattel Girls & Boys Brands, Fisher-Price Brands, American Girl Brands, and Construction and Arts & Crafts Brands.As reported, worldwide gross sales at Mattel Girls & Boys Brands rose 10% to $609.9 million year over year (up 11% on a constant-currency basis). The upside was driven by a 58% rise (59% in constant currency) in the Entertainment business mainly backed by sales of Cars 3 products.However, the results were somewhat offset by a 5% fall in Barbie sales (down 4% in constant currency) given lower licensing income. The Other Girls brands decreased 28% as reported and in constant currency, due to declines in Monster High and Ever After High sales. Notably, the Wheels category too dropped 6% in the quarter (down 5% in constant currency).Gross sales at Fisher-Price Brands, which includes the Fisher-Price Core, Fisher-Price Friends and Power Wheels brands, slipped 3% year over year to $335 million (down 2% in constant currency).Gross sales at American Girl Brands were $64 million, down 6% from the year-ago quarter as reported and on a constant currency basis.Gross sales at Construction and Arts & Crafts Brands, which includes the Mega Bloks and RoseArt brands, were $53 million, down a significant 27% from second-quarter 2016 (down 26% in constant currency). The fall came primarily due to declines in Mega Bloks licensed products.Performance of Other ToymakersAmong other toymakers, Hasbro Inc. (HAS  -  Free Report) posted mixed second-quarter results, wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues slightly lagged the same. Meanwhile, JAKKS Pacific, Inc. (JAKK  -  Free Report) reported wider-than-expected loss. Also, sales were lower than anticipated in the quarter.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderMattel currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).A better-ranked stock in the same sector is Nintendo Co., Ltd.

676,MAT,"Hasbro, Inc. (HAS  -  Free Report) has been losing sheen of late. Not exempting the current fate of toymakers in the United States, the company is plagued with declining consumer demand and sales crunch.A look at Hasbro’s price trend reveals that the stock has witnessed an unimpressive run on the bourses in the past year. Shares of the company have lost 16.7% against the industry’s rally of 21.3% in the same time frame. This reflects investors’ pessimism on the stock, given uncertain sales environment. Moreover, over the past two months, earnings estimates for the current quarter and year have been revised downward by 29.6% and 6%, respectively, reflecting analysts’ doubt surrounding the company’s future earnings potential.Lower Demand Hurts RevenuesFor quite some time, Hasbro is facing declining demand for its products. Like most other traditional toymakers, the company has to fight a broad array of alternative modes of entertainment including video games, MP3 players, tablets, smart phones and other electronic devices. Due to shift in demand patterns of kids, Hasbro’s revenues are pressurized and are not likely to recover soon. In the first quarter of 2018, net revenues declined 16% from the year-ago level. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 revenues is pegged at $4.9 billion, suggesting a year-over-year decrease of 5.1%.Rising Costs Affect ProfitsHasbro has been heavily relying on partnerships, mergers, product innovation and digital invention to revive sales. While such initiatives may aid profits in the long run, related costs would hurt the company in the near term. As it is, selling, distribution and administration expenses, as a percentage of net revenues, increased to 45.8% in the first quarter of 2018 from 28.7% in the prior-year quarter. These costs in turn are hurting the company’s earnings. Subsequently, the consensus estimate predicts earnings to fall 11.5% in 2018 from the previous year.Toys ‘R’ Us Woes Likely to LingerThe U.S. toy industry was dealt a heavy blow when the country’s largest independent toy seller, Toys ""R"" Us filed for bankruptcy last September. Adding a nail to the coffin, Toys “R” US said that it is liquidating its U.S. operations, leaving toymakers like Hasbro, Mattel (MAT  -  Free Report) and JAKK Pacific (JAKK  -  Free Report) in a mess as they used to derive a considerable portion of their revenues from sales to Toys ""R"" Us. Although retailers like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) had come to rescue these toymakers, they currently don’t have shelf spaces as big as Toys “R” Us, which is a concern.Meanwhile, despite testing waters with new distribution methods, development of digital-play components and exploration of ventures with other industries, Hasbro is unable to revive sales. In fact, owing to the liquidation, sales of Hasbro across every branddeclined in the first quarter of 2018.We believe that the effect of this liquidation will linger further as Toys “R” Us was the last major chain fully dedicated to selling toys. Owing to this, the overall industry is expected to grow at a much slower pace for quite some time.Hasbro carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

Sales were also lower than expected in the quarter.This California-based company’s loss of 66 cents per share was much wider compared to the prior-year quarter loss of 27 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 24 cents.JAKKS Pacific’s revenues declined 15.2% year over year to $119.6 million owing to the company’s suspension of sales to one of its retail customers and decrease in several of its film-related licensed properties. Revenues also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $131.8 million by over 9%.JAKKS Pacific, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  JAKKS Pacific, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | JAKKS Pacific, Inc. QuoteBehind the Headline NumbersGross margin in the second quarter was 28.2%, down 360 basis points (bps) year over year, given deleveraging of fixed costs, product mix shifts and closeout sales in some categories.Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes and amortization) was a negative $5.4 million, compared with the year-ago quarter’s $4.0 million.2017 ViewFor 2017, JAKKS Pacific continues to expect higher net income, earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA on lower net sales compared to 2016. Moreover, the company anticipates enhanced profitability in the second half of 2017 due to its efficient marketing undertakings and cost-cutting policies. The company’s continued focus on building its base of evergreen brands and categories as well as entering new categories, creating a strong portfolio of new and existing licenses, and developing owned IP and content are also expected to drive profits.Other ToymakersAmong other toymakers, Hasbro Inc.

678,MAT,"Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report) foresees a weak holiday season as revealed in a recent regulatory filing. With Christmas just around the corner, the sales forecast hints at various challenges for the largest toy retailer in the United States.Despite owning prominent brands like Barbie, Fisher-Price and Fijit Friends, Mattel expects 2017 sales to decline by a percentage of at least mid-to-high single digits compared to 2016.What Worries Mattel?Mattel is anxious about its key retail partners moving toward tighter inventory management. Moreover, Toy Box-related challenges and certain underperforming brands are likely to dent the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.As it is, the toy industry has been tricky for companies like Hasbro (HAS  -  Free Report), Mattel and JAKKS Pacific, Inc. (JAKK  -  Free Report) due to declining demand for traditional toys. Owing to the growing demand for a broad array of alternative modes of entertainment, including video games, MP3 players, tablets, smartphones and other electronic devices from companies like Electronic Arts, Inc. (EA  -  Free Report), U.S. toy makers are facing a decline in sales.Moreover, the recent Toys ‘R’ Us bankruptcy aggravated matters. Mattel has been particularly affected by the bankruptcy as it resulted in a year-over-year decline in third-quarter 2017 revenues and profits. In fact, since the company’s gross margins included the associated cost of goods sold, the net sales reversal in Toys ‘R’ Us accounted for approximately one-fifth of the year-over-year decline in total margin. The effect of the bankruptcy is expected to linger in the upcoming quarters as well.The company reported a 620 basis points (bps) year-over-year decline in gross margins in the first nine months of 2017. This decline, owing to unfavorable product mix, higher freight and logistics expenses and lower fixed cost absorption, is expected to reflect in fourth-quarter 2017 results. A persistent decline in the top line is likely to result in gross margin deterioration due to higher inventory write-downs and discounts offered to clear inventory.Meanwhile, Mattel suspended its dividend payments and adopted cost-cutting initiatives to counter weak sales. The company has been looking to cut costs in order to drive gross margin and operating profits.Owing to the initiatives, Mattel’s advertising and promotion expenses contracted 9% from the year-ago level in the first nine months of 2017. However, for 2017, the company expects a slight uptick in the expenses in comparison to 2016 on a gross dollar basis. Additionally, the company expects a year-over-year rise in other operating expenses in fourth-quarter 2017.Owing to such factors, Mattel’s operating margin, excluding severance expenses, is expected to be significantly lower in fourth-quarter 2017 from the prior-year level. In addition, gross margin and operating income could be further impacted by fourth quarter charges or expenses which includes restructuring and other non-cash write-offs. These expenses could be material or incurred in connection with the company’s recently announced cost savings program, targeting run-rate cost savings of at least $650 million.Over the last 60 days, earnings estimates for the current quarter and year have gone down 18.9% and 93.8%, respectively. Also, year to date, shares of the company have lost 44.2% as against the industry’s gain of 43.5%.This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company, which generally rakes in about 40% of its annual sales during Christmas holidays, is likely to face a decline in sales and margins this season owing to the above-mentioned dampeners.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

679,MAT,"The retail industry has seen its fair share of near and full-blown casualties over the past several years, but perhaps no brick-and-mortar bankruptcy has been greater than that of Toys ‘R’ Us. What’s worse, the liquidation of Toys ‘R’ Us has had a negative effect on some of the iconic brands it carried, including Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report).Mattel is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of toys. Its family of brands includes Barbie, Hot Wheels, Matchbox, American Girl, Fisher-Price, and more. These iconic toy lines obviously still carry plenty of clout in the industry, but recent headwinds make MAT look like a stock to avoid for now.Investors should also note that these headwinds have led to negative analyst sentiment and downward earnings estimate revisions, which has earned the stock a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Plus, there’s probably a few other reasons to be bearish on MAT right now. Let’s take a closer look.Latest Earnings and OutlookMattel most recently reported earnings on April 26. For that period, Mattel reported an adjusted loss of 60 cents per share, which was much wider than the consensus estimate of a 39-cent loss. In the prior-year quarter, Mattel saw a loss of 32 cents per share.Mattel’s Q1 2018 results were significantly affected by the Toys ‘R’ Us bankruptcy, and management said it expects this to continue being an issue in the near term.The company’s next earnings report is expected to be released after the market closes on July 25. For this second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for Mattel to report an adjusted loss of 31 cents per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline over more than 121%.Looking out a bit further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Mattel’s full-year 2018 earnings currently sits at -$0.55 per share, and this figure has been trending downward. In fact, three negative revisions over the past 60 days have dragged this projection down about three cents.This negative revision activity has earned the stock a #5 (Strong Sell), but as mentioned, there are a few other reasons to be hesitant about MAT right now.Reasons for ConcernPart of the underlying issue for Mattel is tighter retail inventory management. This put a huge dent on the company’s Q1 sales and is expected to continue being a headwind going forward. Add this to marketing and promotional costs, as well as cost associated with developing digital platforms, and it’s no surprise that Mattel's margins are under pressure.Another issue to be aware of is a broader problem throughout the toy industry. Unfortunately for these traditional brands, the advent of video games, MP3 players, tablets, and smartphones has grabbed the attention of their core audiences.This would only hurt so much if Mattel could respond with strong product innovation and design. But that’s not really something we’ve seen from Mattel lately—although the company’s recent renewed commitment to building core brands like American Girl, Barbie, and Fisher-Price might be a long-term catalyst.Mattel suspended its dividend at the end of 2017, and there’s not been many positive signs since then. Simply put, there are too many questions about the company’s near-term earnings outlook and broader industry trends for investors to want to dive into this stock right now.Want more market analysis from this author?

(MAT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 numbers on Feb 1, after market close.Last quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 83.93%. In fact, Mattel saw earnings misses in each of the trailing four quarters, the average negative surprise being 68.48%.Further, shares of the company have lost 38.8% in the past year, against the industry’s gain of 49.6%.We note that Mattel is particularly plagued by weak topline performance.

This is reflective of the downward trend, with revenues declining 9.7% year over year in the first nine months of 2017.Now, let’s take a look at how this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company’s top line will shape up around each of its brands in the to-be-reported quarter.Top-Line Performance WeakMattel’s top line has been facing a number of challenges for quite some time. As it is, the industry has been tricky for toymakers due to declining demand for traditional toys. Owing to the growing demand for a broad array of alternative modes of entertainment, including video games, MP3 players, tablets, smartphones and other electronic devices from the likes of Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report), the U.S. toy industry is facing declining sales.Moreover, the recent Toys ‘R’ Us bankruptcy aggravated matters for major toy makers like Mattel, Hasbro (HAS  -  Free Report) and JAKKS Pacific (JAKK  -  Free Report). Owing to the bankruptcy, Mattel witnessed a year-over-year decline in third-quarter 2017 revenues and profits. The effect of the bankruptcy is expected to affect the to-be-reported results as well.Notably, per a recent regulatory filing, the company expects sales to decline in the fourth quarter as the company’s key retail partners are moving toward tighter inventory management. Mattel, Inc. Revenue (TTM)  Mattel, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Mattel, Inc. Quote Major Brands Likely to UnderperformAll of Mattel’s major brands have seen a decline in gross sales in the first nine months of 2017 from the year-ago level. The company expects 2017 sales to decline mid-to-high single digits compared to 2016.The Mattel Girls & Boys Brands witnessed a 6% decline in gross revenues in the first nine months of 2017. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter. The fourth-quarter consensus estimate for gross sales of the brand is pegged at $1.04 billion, reflecting a 1% year-over year decline.The Fisher-Price Brands recorded year-over-year gross revenue decline of 11% in the first nine months. The trend is expected to persist as the consensus estimate for the same in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $596 million, reflecting a 1.9% decrease from the year-ago quarter.The fourth-quarter consensus estimate for the American Girl Brands’ gross sales is pegged at $259 million, showing an 8.8% year-over-year decline, which again is reflective of the downward trend. Gross sales of the brand declined 18% year over year in the first nine months of 2017.Similarly, Construction and Arts & Crafts Brands saw a 30% year-over-year decline in gross sales in the first nine months of 2017. The consensus estimate for gross sales for the said brand is pegged at $103 million, reflecting a 17.5% decline from the year-earlier quarter.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more.

681,MAT,"Leading toy-maker, Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report), is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 numbers on Jul 27, after market close.Last quarter, Mattel’s loss was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 88.24%. In fact, the trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise is a negative 12.08%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Mattel, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Mattel, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Mattel, Inc. QuoteFactors Likely to Influence Q2 ResultsMattel’s increased focus on improving its point of sale through launch of new products, along with strategic initiatives like entering new categories and strengthening the Girls’ portfolio are expected to bolster second-quarter results. Also, solid performance in some international markets, particularly China, might boost sales.Notably, the company’s core brands like Hot Wheels, Fisher-Price and MEGA Brands have been doing well. We anticipate this trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Efforts to achieve cumulative cost savings and enhanced margins should further boost the quarter’s performance. In fact, as Mattel has worked through most of its inventory issues, it expects to start witnessing the benefits of scale and its cost savings programs.However, challenging macroeconomic environment and sluggish performance at Mattel Girls & Boys Brands might limit revenue growth in the second quarter. Although the company is undertaking various efforts to bring back its flagship brand – Barbie – to its former position, it remains to be seen if desired results are achieved in this quarter, after a dismal first-quarter 2017.Additionally, the U.S. toy category slowdown, unfavorable foreign exchange translation, along with costs related to sales-boosting initiatives might further hamper the quarter’s results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Mattel this quarter.

Several new games as well as traditional ones such as Dungeons & Dragons and Operation also aided the momentum.Meanwhile, Emerging Brands revenues declined 14% to $62.9 million, due to declines in Playskool, Super Soaker and Easy-bake Oven products.Regionally, net revenue from the U.S. and Canada segment increased 16% to $494.4 million, supported by growth in Franchise Brands, Partner Brands and Hasbro Gaming portfolios.

696,MAT,"Hasbro, Inc. (HAS  -  Free Report), not exempting the current fate of traditional toymakers in the United States, is plagued with declining consumer demand and sales crunch. To revive its sales, the company is heavily relying on strategic partnerships and mergers.To this end, Hasbro announced the completion of its previously declared acquisition of Saban Properties’ Power Rangers and other Entertainment Assets. By adding Power Rangers, Hasbro is trying to strengthen its footprint and reach a greater number of consumers. The first set of Power Rangers products by Hasbro will be available from spring 2019.Details of the DealThe merger deal was funded by a combination of cash and stock valued at $522 million. Previously, Hasbro paid $22.25 million to Saban Brands for the Power Rangers master toy license agreement that was scheduled to begin in 2019. Upon the completion of the deal, Hasbro paid $131.23 million in cash (including a $1.48 million working capital purchase price adjustment) and $25 million was placed into an escrow account. Also, an additional $75 million will be paid on Jan 3, 2019. Hasbro also issued 3,074,190 shares of common stock to Saban Properties, valued at $270 million.Notably, the deal also enabled Hasbro acquire interests in many of Saban Properties’ entertainment assets. These assets include My Pet Monster, Popples, Julius Jr., Luna Petunia, Treehouse Detectives and othersWhy Are Acquisitions the Need of the Hour?The U.S. toy industry was dealt a heavy blow when the country’s largest independent toy seller, Toys ""R"" Us filed for bankruptcy last September. Adding a nail to the coffin, Toys “R” US said that it is liquidating its U.S. operations, leaving toymakers like Hasbro, Mattel (MAT  -  Free Report) and JAKK Pacific (JAKK  -  Free Report) in a mess as they used to derive a considerable portion of their revenues from sales to Toys ""R"" Us. Although retailers like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) had come to rescue these toymakers, they currently don’t have shelf spaces as big as Toys “R” Us, which is a concern.Meanwhile, Hasbro has been trying to limit its dependence on Toys “R” Us since the latter’s Chapter 11 filing. It has been testing waters with new distribution methods, the development of digital-play components and exploration of ventures with other industries. The company has diverse retail channels such as drugstores and dollar chains, and big mass-market retail. It also has a robust online strategy in place that includes interactive content and virtual immersive experiences. It has a five-year agreement with Paramount to enhance storytelling and content capabilities. The company also invested in Boulder Media, its animation studio, and cultivated its digital capacities to drive sales.The acquisition of Power Rangers from Saban Brands underscores the company’s efforts to diversify its revenues beyond retail sales. Hasbro expects these acquisitions to be profitable and offer its customers a varied product range.Our TakeNotably, Hasbro has been one of the early movers to gauge the impact of Toys “R” Us bankruptcy amid peers. Hasbro has been adapting rapidly to changing market conditions and planning counter strategies. However, it is yet to be seen if the company’s efforts to turn around through collaborations, mergers and product innovation could shore up its flagging fortunes.Meanwhile, shares of this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company have underperformed the broader industry in a year’s time.

Teaming up with Quidd, Hasbro plans to sell its limited-edition digital stickers, trading cards and toys from 40 of its brands.

698,MAT,"Markets enjoyed another month of strong gains, boosted by encouraging economic data and hopes surrounding tax reforms. Additionally, the Fed chose not to hike rates in November and offered a positive view about the U.S. economy. Significant progress was made on President Trump’s much-vaunted tax legislation. Ultimately, the House of Representatives finally passed the much awaited tax cuts legislation now named as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.November’s PerformanceFor the month of November, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq surged 3.87%, 2.8% and 2.2%, respectively. The blue-chip index posted its eighth consecutive month of gains — the highest streak of gains in the last 22 years. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 also posted eight straight months in gains. The last time around when the S&P 500 had achieved such a feat was way back in 2007. The indexes have gained in the range of 18% to 28% so far in 2017.The Fed chose not to hike rates in November and offered a positive view about the U.S. economy and said that it has been improving at a ""solid rate."" On Nov 16, the House finally passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Finally, The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes indicated that a rate hike was almost certain in December, but stated that only one or two rate hikes are likely in 2018.Encouraging Domestic DataEconomic data released during November was largely encouraging. ISM Services Index increased from 59.8% to 60.1% in October, reaching its best settlement since August 2005. Construction spending increased 0.3% to $1.22 trillion in September, up from 0.1% in August. Retail sales for October increased a meager 0.2%, but exceeded the consensus estimate.Industrial production for October surged 0.9%, surpassing the consensus estimate of 0.6%. PPI for October came in at 0.4%, in line with the previous month’s figure. Core CPI for October came in at 0.2%, up from 0.1% in September. Factory Orders increased by 1.4%, exceeding the consensus estimate of 1.3%. Consumer spending surged 0.3% in October, in line with the consensus estimate for the period.However, PCE Inflation for October came in at 0.1%, below the previous month’s figure of 0.4%. Additionally, the ISM Manufacturing Index came in at 58.7 in October, down from 59.8 in September.

(Read: Housing Starts Rebound Post Hurricanes: 4 Top Picks)Additionally, sales of new single-family houses in the United States increased 6.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 685,000 in October. This marks the biggest percentage gain since January 1992. (Read: Housing ETFs to Buy in 2018)Further, existing homes sales rose 2% in October from September to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5.48 million. Meanwhile, pending home sales for the month of October increased 3.5%, surpassing the consensus estimate of 2% growth.Q3 GDP Exhibits Highest Rate of Growth Since 2014According to the second estimate from the Department of Commerce, the gross domestic product of the United States expanded at an astounding 3.3% in the third quarter of 2017. This also marks it fastest pace of growth since the third quarter of 2014.Meanwhile, consumer spending, the biggest contributor to economic growth advanced 2.3% in the 3Q17. Further, spending on business equipment shot up 10.4% in the period, also notching up a three-year high. Meanwhile, corporate pre-tax profits have surged 5.4% year over year.Unemployment Hits 17-Yr Low, Job Additions RiseThe United States created 261,000 jobs in October, which came as a breather after only 18,000 job additions in September. Employment in key sectors like food services and drinking places, and professional and business services contributed to last month’s job creations. Employment in food services and drinking places created 89,000 jobs in October, after losing 98,000 jobs in September. Also, professional and business services added 50,000 jobs. However, October’s job additions were below the consensus estimate of 297,000 job additions.Additionally, average hourly wages remained mostly flat in October, which came lower than the consensus estimate of a gain of 0.2%. Meanwhile, in October the unemployment rate came down from 4.2% to 4.1%, lower than the consensus expectation of 4.2%. This is the lowest pace recorded since December 2000.Two Versions of New Tax Bill EmergeOn Nov 2, Republicans of the House finally unveiled a detailed tax cut policy under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which seeks to reduce corporate and revoke the taxes paid by large businesses. The tax bill reduces the corporate tax rate to 20%, making it the permanent rate.On Nov 9, another version of the tax plan was released by the Senate Finance Committee. The Senate version differed from that of the House panel's in several ways. For instance, unlike the House Republicans’ tax proposals which focus on reducing corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, the Senate version supports a similar tax cut only by 2019. Such a confused state of affairs dampened investor sentiment. Moreover, market watchers speculated that no formal decision was likely on the tax Bill before Thanksgiving. Such fears weighed heavily on the broader markets.House of Representatives Passes CutsOn Nov 16, House of Representatives finally passed the much-awaited tax cuts legislation. This takes President Trump and his team one step closer toward realizing their most important agenda — tax reforms.Ultimately, in a 12-11 vote on Nov 28, the Senate Budget Committee advanced the Tax Bill proposed by the members of the GOP. Senators Bob Corker and Ron Johnson also voted in favor of the Bill. Senator John McCain also stated that he would vote in favor of the Bill.Black Friday Sales Push Retailers HigherHoliday shopping continued even after Black Friday, eventually boosting gains for retailers. Per the report from Adobe (ADBE  -  Free Report), Black Friday sales of online retailers totaled a whopping $5.03 billion.

(DDS  -  Free Report) and Gap Inc.(GPS  -  Free Report) all increased 1.8%, 4.7% and 1.21%, respectively. On the other hand, fast food retailer Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report) lost 1.8% and toy makers like Hasbro (HAS  -  Free Report) and Mattel MAT declined 1% and 1.5%, respectively. Fed Refrains from Rate Hike, Powell to Be Next Fed ChairMarkets gained traction on Wednesday after the Fed decided not to raise the benchmark interest rates and offered a positive view about the U.S. economy. At the end of its two day meet, the Fed stated that the U.S. economy has been growing at a ""solid rate"" compared to a ""moderate rate"" in September.Although, the Fed kept the interest rate unchanged in the range of 1% to 1.25%, it indicated that there is a huge possibility of a hike in rate in December.  Meanwhile, a minority of policymakers maintained that the rate hike should be kept on hold till the inflation target of 2% is met.Meanwhile, President Trump appointed member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors Jerome Powell as Janet Yellen’s successor post the expiration of her term as Fed Chief in February.In the minutes of Oct 31-Nov 1 FOMC policy meeting, Fed officials clearly hinted at a December rate hike. However, some policymakers showed concerns over “persistent” slowdown in inflation and indicated that the central bank may scale back to one or at two rate increases next year, which was lower than the previously expected three rate hikes.5 Star Performers for NovemberI ran a screen on Research Wizard for companies with the following parameters:(Click here to sign up for a free trial to the Research Wizard today):1.

It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Mattel shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Mattel is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in the Toys - Games - Hobbies industry that ranks in the Top 33% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while six analysts have revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 52 cents per share to 43 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Mattel right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

702,MAT,"Markets eked out gains on Monday to close slightly higher. While tax woes continued to worry investors, gains were capped further after shares of General Electric plummeted to a five year low after releasing weak EPS guidance for 2018. However, gains for Boeing and Mattel boosted the markets. Meanwhile, the investors closely followed Trump’s visit to Asia. Speaking in Manila Trump commented that he would make an important announcement regarding trade on Wednesday in Washington.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) increased a little less than 0.1%, to close at 23,439.70.

The CBOE VIX increased 1.9% to close at 11.5.Tax Woes Keep Investors on TenterhooksLate last week, a version of the tax plan was released by the Senate Finance Committee. The Senate version differed from that of the House panel's in several ways. Unlike the House Republicans’ tax proposals which focus on reducing corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, the Senate version supports a similar tax cut only by 2019. Also, per House Republicans, the top individual tax rate would be 39.6%, whereas the Senate version puts the ceiling rate at 38.5%. Worries over a possible delay in tax cut plans weighed on investor sentiment.The two versions of the tax Bill will be scrutinized and debated upon before reaching on a conclusion. Such a confused state of affairs dampened investor sentiment. Moreover, market watchers speculated that no formal decision was likely on the tax Bill before Thanksgiving, with some even speculating such a decision would only take place beyond Christmas. Such events dampened investor sentiment and capped gains for the markets.However, market analysts commented that major indexes are still trading at appreciably high levels. Such a run has been largely due to stupendous corporate earnings and a burgeoning U.S. economy.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Dow eked out meager gains, advancing 17.49 points to end in positive territory. Shares of Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) contributed to most of the gains for the Dow.

BA possesses a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

For the next year, the electric giant expects EPS in the range of $1.00-$1.07, which is significantly lower than the 2017 guidance of $1.05-$1.10 a share. The company also reduced its dividend by 50% in a bid to focus more on health care, aviation and energy business segments. Such a decline in the shares of GE weighed both on the Dow and the S&P 500.The S&P 500 gained 0.1% to end in the green. Of the 11 major segments of the S&P 500, eight ended in positive territory. Shares of Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report) surged 20.7% after Hasbro, Inc. (HAS  -  Free Report) approached the former for a potential takeover. Such gains for the toymaker boosted the S&P 500. However, gains for the benchmark was capped after shares of GE declined and weighed on the S&P 500.Meanwhile, Nasdaq also gained 0.1% to end in the green. The tech-heavy index was boosted by gains for the shares of Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), which advanced 0.2%, 0.3% and 1.6%, respectively.Investors Have a Keen Eye on Trump’s Visit to AsiaMarket watchers closely followed Trump’s visit to Asia.

703,MAT,"Shares of Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report) have underperformed the industry in the past six months. The stock has declined 16.6% against the industry’s rise of 11.9%. However, stocks such as Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report), Glu Mobile Inc. (GLUU  -  Free Report) and Electronic Arts Inc. (EA  -  Free Report), which belong to the same industry, have witnessed a sharp gain of 14.5%, 42.4% and 24%, respectively, in the same time frame. Yet, the company seems to be banking on its strategic investments in emerging markets and key power brands — Barbie, Hot Wheels and Fisher-Price — to drive growth. Let’s delve deeper and find out whether Mattel can match its peers performance in the near term.Hidden CatalystsSince the U.S. toy market is somewhat saturated, toy companies like Mattel are exploring growth opportunities abroad. This is because international markets offer greater potential based on the pace of economic growth that they currently enjoy. In fact, Mattel has been seriously focusing on expanding its presence in Europe, Latin American and Asian countries. Meanwhile, emerging markets continue to demonstrate strong growth and long-term potential, mainly Asia-Pacific and Latin America. Particularly, to succeed in China, Mattel has adopted a solutions-based and digital-first method to localize products, which has aided the company to scale swiftly in the past five years.Additionally, the company remains focused on achieving cumulative cost savings through its current cost savings program to boost margins. Also, it is simplifying organization structure, and optimizing processes and supply chain to generate savings across operations.This apart, Mattel continues to make progress in its $650 million Structural Simplification cost savings initiatives and prioritized investments. Subsequently, the company expects to achieve 40% of the $650 million in 2018, with savings heavily weighted toward the second half of the year. In the first quarter, it has already taken actions toward achieving this goal. These actions are expected to result in full-year run-rate savings of approximately $165 million, which includes $85 million in SG&A, $50 million in cost of goods sold, and $30 million in advertising.Given a strong product line-up that includes core brands, licensed brands and lucrative product associations, Mattel remains well positioned for growth. In fact, the company’s premier brand like Hot Wheels has been the category leader in multiple product segments for several years owing to its popularity among young boys and girls. Mattel has also forayed into other consumer product categories such as apparel, fashion and accessories to build the brands.  Hurdles to CrossTighter retail inventory management significantly affected Mattel’s first-quarter 2018 sales and may continue to hamper revenues, going forward. Moreover, due to a simplified cost savings initiative that included write-downs of excess owned inventory and impairment of assets, the company’s adjusted gross margin in 2017 contracted 850 basis points (bps). This downtrend is likely to persist in the short term. Further, costs related to marketing and promotional initiatives, for cleaning up inventories, coupled with the development of digital platforms are likely to keep margins under pressure, moving ahead.Moreover, Mattel’s net revenues in the first quarter of 2018 declined 7% year over year (on a constant-currency basis) due to Toys ""R"" Us liquidation. It also led to sales decline across every brand under Mattel. We believe that the effect of this liquidation will linger further as Toys “R” Us was the last major chain fully dedicated to selling toys, and the overall industry is expected to grow at a much slower pace for quite some time.Mattel has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

704,MAT,"Shares of Mattel Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report) declined over 19% in afterhours trading on Oct 26, after the company reported weak results in the third quarter of 2017.Earnings & Revenue DiscussionMattel’s adjusted earnings of 9 cents per share fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents by 83.9%. The reported figure decreased 87.1% from the prior-year quarter earnings of 70 cents, given lower revenues.     Net sales of $1.56 billion declined 13% year over year as reported and 14% in constant currency. This downturn was due to negative impact of the Toys “R” Us bankruptcy filing, tighter retailer inventory management and challenges with certain underperforming brands. In fact, Mattel also reported lower-than-expected sales in nearly every toy brand and category in the quarter.Resultantly, revenues came below the consensus mark of $1.84 billion by 15%.Quarter HighlightsWorldwide gross sales were down 13% year over year as reported and 15% in constant currency.Gross sales in North America (including the United States, Canada and American Girl) declined 22% as reported and in constant currency mainly due to lower sales as a result of Toys ""R"" Us filing for bankruptcy and tighter retailer inventory management.  Meanwhile, in the International region, gross sales were flat as reported (down 2% on a constant currency basis).Also, gross margin decreased 700 bps to 41.5% from 48.5% recorded in the year-ago quarter. This was due to unfavorable product mix, higher freight and logistics expenses, an adverse impact from Toys ""R"" Us bankruptcy filing and lower licensing income.Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $159.7 million compared with the prior-year quarter figure of $324.1 million.Worldwide Revenues by BrandMattel, through its subsidiaries, sells a broad variety of toy products that are grouped into four major brand categories - Mattel Girls & Boys Brands, Fisher-Price Brands, American Girl Brands, and Construction and Arts & Crafts Brands.As reported, worldwide gross sales at Mattel Girls & Boys Brands fell 9% to $967 million year over year (down 10% on a constant-currency basis). The downside was led by a 40% fall in the Other Girls brands as reported (down 42% in constant currency), given declines in Monster High and DC Super Hero Girls. The Barbie brand decreased 6% as reported and 7% in constant currency, driven by a shift in DVD entertainment strategy. Notably, the Wheels category too dropped 4% in the quarter as reported (down 6% in constant currency) due to declines in Tyco RC vehicles.On the contrary, the Entertainment business witnessed a 1% rise as reported (down 1% in constant currency) backed by increases in CARS sales, offset by declines in Minecraft and WWE Wrestling.Gross sales at Fisher-Price Brands, which includes the Fisher-Price Core, Fisher-Price Friends and Power Wheels brands slipped 15% year over year to $561.6 million as reported (down 16% in constant currency). Declines in Thomas & Friends and infant products hampered the results.Gross sales at American Girl Brands were $88 million, down 30% from the year-ago quarter as reported and on a constant-currency basis primarily due to lower licensing income and initial sales in the prior year via external distribution channels.Gross sales at Construction and Arts & Crafts Brands, which includes the Mega Bloks and RoseArt brands, were $84.6 million, down 29% from second-quarter 2016 as reported (down 30% in constant currency). The decline was primarily due to decrease in Mega Bloks licensed and Preschool products.Bottom LineThe weaker-than-expected results are the latest concern for this toy maker, who named its third chief executive in as many years earlier this year in an endeavor to turn the company around.Nevertheless, following the disappointing results, Mattel now plans to cut $650 million in costs over the next two years. Also, the company has suspended its quarterly dividend of 15 cents beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017 to augment financial flexibility, fortify balance sheet and facilitate strategic investments.Performance of Other ToymakersAmong other toymakers, Hasbro Inc. (HAS  -  Free Report) posted solid third-quarter results, wherein earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, JAKKS Pacific, Inc. (JAKK  -  Free Report) reported lower-than-expected results in the same quarter.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderMattel carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).A better-ranked stock in the same sector is Nintendo Co., Ltd.

705,MAT,"Leading toy-maker, Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, after market close.We note that the Toys “R” Us bankruptcy filed in September is likely to impact Mattel’s revenues and operating profit in the to-be-reported quarter as the retailer makes up a sizeable portion of Mattel’s sales.Meanwhile, the company expects continued gross margin headwinds in the second-half of 2017, given lower licensing income. Also, we note that Mattel plans to make incremental investments in order to drive growth and margin improvement. Though the investments are set to reap benefits in the long term, it may pressurize the company’s margins in the quarter.Also, foreign currency fluctuation remains a cause of concern owing to the company’s widespread global presence.Further, the estimates have revised 13.8% downward over the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings of 56 cents reflects a decline of 20.2% year over year.Mattel, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Mattel, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Mattel, Inc. QuoteAlso, our quantitative model predicts that Mattel does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: Mattel has an Earnings ESP of +4.78%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Mattel has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).As it is we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Segment PerformanceAt the Mattel Girls & Boys Brands, performance of the Other Girls brand has been a matter of concern for long, given declines in Monster High and Ever After High sales. This quarter is no exception. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $136 million for worldwide gross sales for this brand reflects a decrease of 16% year over year.Markedly, efforts on the digital front and focus on better execution of marketing and promotional initiatives are likely to drive sales at the iconic Barbie brand in the quarter. Meanwhile, the Entertainment business is expected to continue performing strongly backed by sales of Cars 3 products. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for gross sales is pegged at $363 million and $361 million for Barbie brand and Entertainment business, reflecting a year-over-year jump of 3.7% and 34.7%, respectively.Overall, worldwide gross sales in this segment is projected to witness a 8.2% year-over-year rise as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $1.15 billion.Furthermore, the company’s Fisher-Price Brands are expected to witness continued point of sale (POS) momentum in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s gross sales of $671 million reflects a rise of 1.4% from the prior-year quarter.Gross sales at Construction and Arts & Crafts Brands that include the Mega Bloks and RoseArt brands might drop in the quarter, given declines in Mega Bloks licensed products. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $115 million, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of 1.4%.The company has also not been able to fully regain its loss of momentum in American Girl Brands and needs to do a lot to capture the full potential of this incredible brand. In fact, the brand has been posting disappointing performance in the last two quarters and is expected to continue doing so in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for segment’s gross sales of $115 million reflects a decline of 8.7% year over year.Other Factors Likely to Affect Q3 ResultsConsumer spending uncertainty in the United States as customers restrain their non-essential purchases, along with overall challenging macroeconomic environment are a threat to Mattel’s top-line growth.Yet, Mattel’s continual efforts to improve point of sale through launch of new products along with its incremental licensed entertainment portfolio are likely to drive third-quarter results. Also, increased focus on building its Power Brands (American Girl, Barbie, Fisher-Price, Hot Wheels and Thomas & Friends) into 360-degree connected systems of play and experiences are anticipated to bolster results in the to-be-reported quarter.Also, strategic investments in emerging markets, particularly China, may further boost sales. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for gross sales in the International region is pegged at $831 million for the quarter under review, representing a year-over-year estimated rise of 24.8%.Markedly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for overall third-quarter sales is pegged at $1.84 billion, reflecting an increase of 2.2% year over year.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter.Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.

706,MAT,"Hasbro (HAS  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter earnings and revenues that beat Wall Street estimates on Monday morning, but the toy maker’s updated guidance for the coming quarter helped send its shares tumbling, taking Mattel (MAT  -  Free Report) along with it.Hasbro’s revenues popped 7% to hit $1.79 billion, while its earnings jumped 3%. Yet, the year-over-year gains were ignored because of the company’s new, lowered fourth-quarter guidance, which cited negative industry trends as a major reason for its downward forecast (also read: Hasbro (HAS  -  Free Report) Beats on Q3 Earnings & Revenues).“As a result of the Toys“R”Us bankruptcy filing in the U.S. and Canada, there was a negative impact on our quarterly revenues and operating profit,” Hasbro’s CEO Brian Goldner said in a statement.Hasbro noted that the recent collapse of one of the largest big-box toy retailers is expected to negatively impact its vitally important holiday quarter, after already suppressing potentially larger third-quarter gains.The company had been selling roughly 9% of its total inventory at the chain. The Toys“R”Us bankruptcy filing could also leave Hasbro on the hook for nearly $60 million in unsecured payments.Despite Hasbro’s lowered expectations, the company still expects for its fourth-quarter revenues to increase by 4% to 7%. But investors are worried because previous Wall Street estimates for Hasbro’s holiday quarter projected a gain of as much as 11.68%.“We are well positioned for the holiday, including good quality inventory at Hasbro and at retail, backed by strong consumer momentum,” CFO Deborah Thomas said in a statement. “We continue to work closely with Toys“R”Us as we head into the holiday period.”Hasbro’s stock had gained over 26% since the start of the year, which almost doubled the S&P 500. However, in the last 12-weeks, the company’s stock price has fallen almost 8%, which likely priced in fears of the now official Toys“R”Us-based fourth-quarter forecast.Shares of Hasbro sunk over 8.50% Monday morning to hit their lowest point since February.Hasbro’s new suppressed holiday quarter guidance, based in large part on negative overall industry trends, caused shares of fellow toy making power Mattel to fall.Shares of Mattel dipped over 3.50% and now rest close to their 52-week low. Mattel is currently a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and is set to report its quarterly earnings on Oct. 26.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.

707,MAT,"Hasbro Inc. (HAS  -  Free Report) posted robust third-quarter 2017 results, wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Change in Reporting Notably, since first-quarter 2017, Hasbro started reporting its revenues by brand portfolios that include Franchise Brands, Partner Brands, Hasbro Gaming and Emerging Brands. In fact, the company has ceased providing revenue breakdown by product category: Boys, Games, Girls and Preschool. Earnings and Revenues Discussion Adjusted earnings of $2.09 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.93 by 8.3% and grew 3% year over year. Hasbro's net revenue of $1.79 billion also improved 7% over the prior-year quarter and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.77 billion by more than 1%. Notably, revenues improved in three of its four brand portfolios. Hasbro, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Hasbro, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Hasbro, Inc. QuoteWhile Franchise Brands, Hasbro Gaming and Emerging Brands recorded a gain, revenues declined at Partner Brands. Hasbro's cost of sales ratio increased 160 basis points (bps) to 40.8%. Meanwhile, selling, distribution and administration expenses ratio rose 40 bps but royalty expense ratio declined 20 bps. Additionally, operating profit fell 0.3% year over year to $360.9 million. Behind the Headline Numbers The Franchise Brand portfolio posted revenues of $827.3 million, up 7% year over year, driven by revenue growth in Nerf, Transformers, My Little Pony and Monopoly. Partner Brand revenues decreased 2% to $485.7 million owing to declines in certain brands, including Yo-Kai Watch and Dreamworks’ Trolls, which were partially offset by revenue gains in Beyblade, Star Wars, Disney Descendants and Sesame Street brands. The Hasbro Gaming portfolio recorded a 22% year-over-year increase in revenues to $280.1 million. This uptick reflects Hasbro’s diverse gaming portfolio, including face-to-face gaming and digital gaming. Also, Emerging Brands revenues increased 9% to $198.3 million, driven primarily by growth in Baby Alive and Furreal Friends. Regionally, net revenue from the United States and Canada segment increased 7% to $993.8 million, supported by growth across all portfolios. However, the segment was negatively impacted by the Toys “R” Us bankruptcy in the both the places as well as a shift in product mix. Consequently, the segment’s operating profit declined 5% year over year to $217.3 million. International revenues were $739.2 million, up 7% year over year. Revenue growth in Franchise Brands and Hasbro Gaming was offset by a decline in Emerging and Partner Brands. Notably, increased sales were registered across Latin America, Emerging markets, Europe and Asia Pacific regions. However, international operating profit was $132 million, down about 1% from a year ago. The Entertainment and licensing segment revenues grew 4% year over year to $58.4 million, backed by higher consumer products and entertainment revenues. Also, the segment's operating profit increased 20% to $16.9 million. Zacks Rank   Hasbro carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(EA  -  Free Report) is slated to release its quarterly numbers on Oct 31.

708,MAT,"Investors in Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Oct 27, 2017 $12 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy. What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Mattel shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Mattel is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in the Toys - Games - Hobbies industry that ranks in the Top 17% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased its earnings estimates for the current quarter, while four analysts have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 65 cents per share to 56 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Mattel right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

709,MAT,"Leading U.S. toymaker Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report) has been facing multiple headwinds such as sluggish performance by certain segments and brands, negative currency translation and sluggishness in the U.S. retail toy market. Moreover, the Toys 'R' Us bankruptcy ado has added to the woes.Major Brands’ Performance Lack LusterPersistently sluggish performance by certain key brands has been a major drag. At the Mattel Girls & Boys Brands, performance of the Other Girls brand has been a concern for long owing to declines in Monster High and Ever After High sales. Sales at the iconic Barbie brand also declined in the last two quarters. Though the brand had posted positive sales in the past three quarters, its sales have been mostly soft since the beginning of 2013 owing to stiff competition from other fashion dolls.Meanwhile, though the company began 2017 with expectations of mid-to-high single digit growth in the top line, it is now targeting low single-digit sales growth. The main reason behind this tweaked guidance is expected lower sales for Thomas, American Girl, and MEGA brands.Although the company is making important changes this year in these brands, it will take some time for them to gain momentum.Weakness in Toy Market & Other ConcernsThe overall U.S. retail environment for toys is facing pressing concerns as customers are cutting down on non-essential purchases. Also, shift in consumer demand and preferences toward smart technologies and digital gaming is continuously hurting Mattel.Notably, the company has extensive international presence and is therefore highly vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates. Foreign exchange translation has been hurting revenues and profits over the past few quarters. Strengthening of the dollar against other currencies might continue to hurt revenues in 2017.Meanwhile, lack of schemes for brand awareness and innovation has been affecting revenues and Point of Sales (POS). Though overall POS has been mostly positive owing to the company’s efforts to lower retail inventories, the improvement is not broad based. We need to wait for more consistent progress across all of the company’s brands.Since 2016, Mattel no longer holds the rights to develop dolls based on The Walt Disney Company characters from the animated movies Frozen and Disney Princess. Though Mattel is one of Disney’s major entertainment partners for a number of Boys and infant pre-school properties, the loss of rights has been adversely impacting its revenues. The partnership with Disney has been a solid growth driver.Also, the recent Toys ‘R’ Us Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing is likely to affect Mattel as well as other toymakers like Hasbro, Inc. (HAS  -  Free Report) and JAKKS Pacific, Inc. (JAKK  -  Free Report) as these companies generate almost 10% of their overall sales from Toys ‘R’ Us.Some RespiteMattel possesses a strong product line-up, which includes core brands, licensed brands and lucrative product associations. Furthermore, the company has been making efforts on the digital front and focusing on better execution of marketing and promotional initiatives to regain sales momentum. Product innovation and strategic partnerships with other companies position Mattel well in terms of its brand presence. Also, the company is vying to gain traction in international markets.Bottom LineMattel’s shares have massively underperformed its industry year to date. The company’s shares have lost 43.5% as compared to the industry’s gain of 48.4%.Moreover, Mattel’s earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and year have declined 12.1% and 21.5%, respectively, in the last 60 days.Despite strong brand presence and sales-boosting initiatives, company-specific and industry concerns coupled with decline in the company’s stock price as well as downward estimate revisions signal at more trouble down the road for this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company.A better-ranked stock in the same sector is Nintendo Co., Ltd. (NTDOY  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company’s current-year earnings are expected to increase 211.70%.

710,MAT,"Per a recent Wall Street Journal report, Hasbro, Inc. (HAS  -  Free Report) has made an offer to take over beleaguered rival Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report).Following the news, shares of Hasbro rallied more than 3%, while that of Mattel rose nearly 24% in after-hours trading on Nov 10.Inside the HeadlinesDetails of the deal have been kept under wraps as it may not officially materialize. Also, reports suggest no instance of any company-owned statements regarding the merger.However, if the deal materializes, it will bring together two of the largest toy manufacturers in the United States.In fact, these major toymakers have engaged in merger talks at least twice in the last two decades.Why Mattel? We note that the toy industry scenario has been tricky for companies like Hasbro, Mattel and JAKKS Pacific, Inc. (JAKK  -  Free Report) due to declining demand for traditional toys. Owing to the growing demand for a broad array of alternative modes of entertainment, including video games, MP3 players, tablets, smartphones and other electronic devices from companies like Electronic Arts, Inc. (EA  -  Free Report), U.S. toy makers are facing a decline in sales.Moreover, the recent Toys ‘R’ Us bankruptcy aggravated matters. Mattel has been particularly affected by the bankruptcy as the company stated it as a reason for its year-over-year decline in revenues and profits in third-quarter 2017. The effect of the bankruptcy is expected to linger in the upcoming quarters as well.Moreover, Mattel suspended its dividend and adopted a cost-cutting drive to counter the weak top-line performance.Thus, the rumored deal can prove to be beneficial for the companies. It could create the most preeminent toy company bringing together Hasbro's My Little Pony, Monopoly and Nerf brands with Mattel's Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels toys. The combined entity is likely to have a competitive edge with enhanced pricing power to negotiate with entertainment studios over TV and movie franchises.In fact, Hasbro’s shares have rallied 17.5% so far this year, valuing the company at around $11 billion. Meanwhile, Mattel has a market value of about $5 billion after the company’s shares lost 47% year to date. This makes Mattel an appealing takeover target for Hasbro.Bottom LineHasbro has been on the lookout for takeover targets to diversify its revenue stream for long. A deal with Mattel will also help the company deal with the troubles plaguing the broader industry.Now, it is to be seen whether the merger, if it goes through, will be able to alter the fate of these leading toymakers.Hasbro carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), while Mattel has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

The objectives include expansion of its solid base of evergreen brands, entering into new categories, creating a strong portfolio of new and existing licenses, and developing owned IP and content.However, the company faces challenges in the form of a difficult retail environment, rising costs, competition from alternative modes of entertainment and adverse forex translations.Meanwhile, JAKKS Pacific continues to expect higher net income, earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA on lower net sales for 2017 compared with the previous year. Also, the company anticipates enhanced profitability in the second half of the current year owing to its efficient marketing undertakings and cost-cutting policies.Key Growth DriversGoing forward, we are particularly optimistic on the company’s innovative partnerships and joint ventures that should help JAKKS Pacific gain market share in a competitive industry. Additionally, the company’ strategic acquisitions is likely to aid in entering new categories.Markedly, JAKKS Pacific’s collaborations with Disney, Skechers, Nickelodeon, Cabbage Patch Kids to manufacture toys and merchandise related to these brands is also likely to drive growth. Furthermore, the company’s licensing agreements with popular movie and television franchises are expected to boost sales as merchandise based on movies enjoys immense popularity.In fact, since the beginning of the year, it has entered into multiple licensing agreements spanning across varied product lines that are all set to hit stores in the near term and add to the top line. Also, despite lower sales in the first-half 2017, the company expects sales decline in the second half to be more modest as it heads into peak selling season.JAKKS Pacific also remains committed to diversifying its footprint outside the United States in various key markets and currently operates in 65 countries, worldwide. Notably, the expansion initiatives are likely to strengthen its international presence as well as customer base and thereby aid in growing sales, profit margins and the company’s access to attract licenses.Furthermore, in order to cash in on the demand for smartphone gaming, the company has introduced a number of mobile gaming apps and digital games along with the physical toys, which would help the company. JAKKS Pacific’s investment in digital innovation is also expected to help in brand building, besides helping the company to capitalize on the increasingly lucrative technology-based gaming market.Interestingly, JAKKS Pacific has realized the importance of online retailing and has shifted a great amount of focus to aggressively growing online sales. In fact, it continues to modify the company’s sales and logistics capabilities in order to capitalize on this shift. Markedly, sales to online customers and the e-commerce division of traditional retailers rose over 50% year over year in the second quarter.ConcernsIt is to be noted that a challenging retail environment for toys due to lower consumer confidence remains a major concern for JAKKS Pacific as well as other leading toy makers like Hasbro, Inc. (HAS  -  Free Report) and Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report). Currently, customers are reducing non-essential purchases, which in turn is hurting toy makers’ revenue.Continuous competition from technology-based gaming companies like Electronic Arts, Inc. (EA  -  Free Report) and Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report) has also been posing a significant threat to the market position of toy makers like JAKKS Pacific.Meanwhile, as the U.S. dollar continues to show strength against various other currencies, the negative currency impact is likely to hurt revenues, given the company’s considerable international presence. Moreover, the British Pound’s plunge in value since the Brexit vote is impacting JAKKS Pacific’s revenues. In fact, foreign exchange movements can be cited as one of the primary reasons behind the company’s expectations of lower revenues in 2017 than the last year.Additionally, the company is experiencing increased costs related to international expansion, development of new IP and acquisitions. These initiatives are adding greatly to expenses without the offsetting benefit of having any material impact on revenue growth. Unless the trend reverses, the company’s margins will remain under pressure, despite several cost-containment efforts.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

715,MAT,"JAKKS Pacific, Inc. (JAKK  -  Free Report) recently stated the anticipated effects the company will face due to a bankruptcy filing by its significant partner, Toys ‘R’ Us.In its previous guidance for the third- and fourth-quarter 2017, JAKKS Pacific projected Toys ‘R’ Us sales to account for 5% to 6% of total sales. However, the realization of this looks unlikely right now.Moreover, the company expects to incur a net loss and record negative earnings per share for the full year.Meanwhile, JAKKS Pacific expects charges in cash due to write-off of bad debt and minimum guarantee shortfall, and non-cash charges owing to impairment of some assets as well as goodwill from acquisitions. Markedly, these charges will be against the company’s 2017 income.Though the company continues to expect positive EBITDA for the year, the figure is anticipated to be lower year on year.For several years, Toys ‘R’ Us has been plagued by headwinds such as huge debt and heightening competition, especially from e-commerce giants such as Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) that offer better prices to customers. This led to the company file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.For JAKKS Pacific, the uninsured part of the amount due from Toys ‘R’ Us comprises less than 3% of the company’s outstanding accounts receivable. More than JAKKS Pacific, the bankruptcy ado is more likely to affect the two leading U.S. toymakers —Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report) and Hasbro, Inc. (HAS  -  Free Report).Overall, the recent challenges faced by the retail environment for toys due to shift in consumer’s taste and preferences are concerning. The emerging smart technologies and digital gaming companies are also posing a threat to traditional toy makers.Nevertheless, in the long run, JAKKS Pacific is not anticipating any adverse materialimpacts that can possibly pose a hindrance tothe company’s ability to carry out its on-going corporate initiatives and business operations. The company plans on continuing with its relentless effort in digitally innovative toy making.Consequently, shares of the company have declined 38.8% year to date, underperforming its industry’s growth of 50.2%.Currently, JAKKS Pacific carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

718,MAT,"The Consumer Discretionary sector is witnessing positive trends thanks to the improving economy backed by a favorable labor market, increased consumer spending and enhanced consumer confidence.While this indicates favorable prospects for the sector participants, leading global manufacturer of toys, Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report), has been witnessing challenging trends for quite some time. Evidently, the company has lagged earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 47.5%. Moreover, sales have missed the same for three consecutive quarters.Consequently, shares of this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock plunged 45.3% year to date, underperforming the industry’s rally of 49.2%.What’s Troubling Mattel?We note that one of the prime concerns for the company has been the persistent sluggish performance of certain key brands including Mattel Girls & Boys Brands, Barbie, Thomas, MEGA brands and American Girl Brands. Mattel has been witnessing soft sales for these brands due to increased competitive advertising and value players.Though the company began 2017 expecting top-line growth in the mid- to high-single digits, it is now targeting low single-digit sales growth for the year. The lowered expectations reflect lower sales of Thomas, American Girl and MEGA brands. These brands represent half of the reduction of the company’s full-year revenue outlook and the impact of lower sales from its fragmented innovation pipeline, which Mattel plans to rebalance and refocus for the rest of 2017 for improving productivity.While Mattel expects its incremental licensed entertainment portfolio, strategic investments in emerging markets and key power brands – Barbie, Hot Wheels and Fisher-Price – to drive growth in the second half of 2017, we believe it will take time for all the brands to show steady development.Meanwhile, lack of innovative schemes for brand awareness and brand innovation have been hurting the company’s revenues and POS momentum, which is putting pressure on revenues and margins. Also, the U.S. toy category slowdown, unfavorable foreign exchange translation and loss of Disney deal remain concerns. Competition from technology-based gaming companies poses a significant threat to its market position as well. Given the deep routed troubles and the negative surprise trends, the company’s estimates have witnessed downward revisions in the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 73 cents for 2017 and 90 cents for 2018 moved down 7.6% and 10%, respectively. Also, the stock bears a VGM Score of D that signals trouble down the road.How is the Consumer Discretionary Sector Positioned?Though Mattel seems in deep trouble, there are many stocks in the Consumer Discretionary space that promise growth. Overall, the sector has put up a decent performance in the past. A look at the sector’s performance shows that it has witnessed growth of 14.9% in the past year, almost in line with the momentum of the S&P 500 index that grew 15%.Further, it carries a Zacks Sector Rank of #4 (out of 16), placing it at the top 25% of the Zacks classified sectors.Hence, there lies an opportunity to invest in Consumer Discretionary stocks which are poised to make the best of the improving economic situation.4 Trending PicksThat said, we bring you four Consumer Discretionary stocks that are displaying solid performance backed by sound fundamentals, Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), a VGM Score of A or B, surging share price and a track record of better-than-expected results.

719,MAT,"On Tuesday, after reports that the toy retailer was preparing for financial restructuring, Toys ‘R’ Us filed for bankruptcy Monday night after years of struggling to keep up with competitors and to pay down billions of dollars in debt.Toys ‘R’ Us’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing came in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in Richmond; the company said that its Canadian unit will also seek reorganization in Ontario’s bankruptcy court. Toys ‘R’ Us will remain open, but is protected from creditors’ claims as it begins a court-supervised restructuring plan.“Today marks the dawn of a new era at Toys ‘R’ Us where we expect that the financial constraints that have held us back will be addressed in a lasting and effective way,” said Dave Brandon, chairman and chief executive of Toys R Us, in a statement. “…We are confident these are the right steps to ensure that the iconic Toys ‘R’ Us and Babies ‘R’ Us brands live on for many generations.”For years, Toys ‘R’ Us was the first stop for shoppers during the holiday rush or if a birthday gift was needed. It’s prominent flagship in New York City’s Times Square, iconic Geoffrey the Giraffe mascot, and stores that held literally thousands of items, a Toys ‘R’ Us was a go-to spot for toys and baby products.But like many brick-and-mortar retailers, and despite having its own website, the toy retailer could not keep up with customer demand, and the changing ways in which those customers shopped. Competitors like Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), and especially Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) soon eclipsed Toys ‘R’ Us, offering customers much better prices and an overall greater shopping experience.Its $5 billion debt load hasn’t helped the company much either, with much of that stemming from the 2005 deal that took the toy company private. Toys ‘R’ Us is owned by three companies: private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Bain Capital, and real estate firm Vornado Realty Trust.We can also look at how traditional toys have declined in popularity among children and teenagers, two demographics that are now more interested in smartphones and tablets, but more importantly, the apps and games for those devices: think Snapchat (SNAP  -  Free Report) and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report)-owned Instagram. For a retailer that primarily sells traditional toys, this rise in electronics certainly hurt.Retail: A Closer LookToys ‘R’ Us is not the only private-equity-owned retailer that has suffered. Kids apparel company Gymboree filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, while David’s Bridal, Neiman Marcus, and Nine West Holdings are facing similar financial problems. Neiman Marcus, which is high-end department store, said it was considering putting itself up for sale after trying to pay down its debt load for over a decade. And then you have the laundry list of retailers that have closed hundreds of store locations, including Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Sears , and Bebe .Heading into the 2017 holiday season, however, Toys ‘R’ Us’s bankruptcy will likely impact the top two toymakers in the U.S.: Mattel (MAT  -  Free Report) and Hasbro (HAS  -  Free Report). Jakks Pacific (JAKK  -  Free Report), which makes a wide range of licensed toys, could also feel the effects. Mattel is known for the Barbie and Hot Wheels brands, while Hasbro is the maker of Play-Doh, Transformers, and My Little Pony Toys.Since initial reports surfaced that Toys ‘R’ Us was weighing its financial options, shares of both Mattel and Hasbro took a big hit, since the retailer made up a sizable percent of the toymakers’ sales last year. But by today, each stock has bounced back, with MAT and HAS closing the day up 1.2% and 2%, respectively.Toys ‘R’ Us currently operates approximately 1,600 stores, including Babies ‘R’ Us, around the world, and employs 65,000 people in total.4 Promising Stock Picks to Keep an Eye On With news stories about computer hacking and identity theft becoming increasingly commonplace, the cybersecurity industry looks like a promising investment opportunity.
