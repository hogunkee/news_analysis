2,JCI,"Dancing to the Federal Reserve's familiar rate-hike-is-coming tune in August, the major stock market indexes did little more than tread water near multiyear if not all-time highs.A pullback by defensive sectors largely offset an advance by cyclical sectors as the S&P 500 inched up 0.14%. U.S. diversified stock mutual funds edged ahead 0.48%, according to Lipper Inc.General domestic taxable bond funds rose 0.74% to be up 8.53% for the year.At an economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., in late August, Fed Chair Janet Yellen and other Fed officials said the economy is strong enough for a rate hike.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month Leaders""The fact that the market saw an opportunity for a rate increase at the Sept. 21 (Fed) meeting was an indication that the U.S. economy was actually moving in the right direction,"" said Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer, equities at Charles Schwab Investment Management. ""So the market reacted to that.""Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceThat reaction took the form of a rotation out of high-dividend stocks and stable sectors into more economically cyclical sectors, Aguilar said. Investors pulled money out of utilities, consumer staples and telecom, he added. They shifted much of it into technology, health care, consumer discretionary and financials.Sector funds reflected some of that. Financial services funds gained 4.25% last month on average. Tech funds gained 2.33%. Health/biotech and consumer-goods funds lost ground.The mood shifted again early this month when the Bureau of Labor Statistics revised the count of its July jobs gains upward to 275,000, but reported August jobs gains of only 151,000. That was less than the 180,000 jobs forecast by economists polled by Reuters. The relatively weak employment growth increased the odds that the Fed would delay its rate hike until November or even December, and the stock market rallied modestly and rotated back toward dividend stocks.""There isn't a lot of market leadership now,"" Aguilar said last week. ""Bottom line: We're going to have to wait until the Fed's September meeting to know what comes next.""IBD's TAKE: How will investors react once the Fed finally hikes rates? Understanding the stock market's prevailing trend is a key factor when you are choosing between growth and defensive stock buys. For pointers, visit IBD University.Chip Rewey, lead manager of Third Avenue's $1.2 billion Value (TVFVX) and $317 million Small Cap Value (TVSVX) funds, said ""the market is confused by the Fed, the way Charlie Brown is confused by Lucy.""Rewey added that whenever the Fed does raise rates, sustained, aggressive hikes are unlikely. ""Still, why allocate (money) to yield-oriented sectors when you see a raise coming off generational low rates?"" he asked.Instead, Rewey has added to stocks that should not be hurt by a hike. He recently increased his stake in Johnson Controls (JCI), which makes building-efficiency systems and just completed its combination with Tyco, which makes fire and security systems.""We like the merger with Tyco,"" Rewey said. ""There's a lot of misunderstanding about what type of company Johnson is. Many people still think of it as an auto company (because of its history as a maker of car seats and interiors). But the majority post-Tyco merger is a building services company.""Rewey also added to Amgen (AMGN), which has a dividend yield of 2.3%. ""We saw it as a leading pharmaceuticals (company) that had been caught in the generic fears about (drugmakers because of political calls for intervention over pricing).""Rewey bought shares under 150. They're now trading near 170. ""At that price, we're getting its pipeline for free,"" he said. The company has 31 potential treatments in preclinical and clinical targets development, including 12 in phase three tests, which are closer to market. Another nine biosimilars are in development, including three in later stages, nearing the point where they might go on sale.Rewey also likes Comerica (CMA), a bank with most of its operations in Michigan, Texas, California, Arizona and Florida. ""It's trading around 1.1 times tangible book value,"" he said. ""We think it's undervalued. They're cutting costs. If rates and loan growth go up, their return on equity will go up.""And Rewey likes media giant CBS (CBS), which is controlled by Sumner Redstone through National Amusements, which also controls Viacom (VIA). Some family members and company executives have been jockeying for power over the company once Redstone ceases to exercise control.""Investor overreaction to the noise over Viacom has weighed on the value of CBS stock,"" Rewey said. ""They are taking an advertising driven model and taking it to more fee-driven (which should generate revenue and earnings that are more visible and stable). They should be almost 60% fee-driven by 2018 once they spin out their radio business. And they're in a stock buyback program. And we like the management team, led by Les Moonves.""James Abate, chief investment officer of Centre Funds and manager of its $156 million Select Equity (DHAMX), says it's possible the Fed won't raise rates in the wake of disappointing recent economic data.In this environment, he likes consumer staples names PepsiCo (PEP) and Kimberly Clark (KMB) for their aggressive cost cutting. He likes the outlook for Coach (COH), whose rising sales per employee show that its restructuring is on track, he says. And he likes Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN), whose innovations provide them with a competitive moat.RELATED:The August Jobs Report Was The Weakest Since 2010As Companies Step Up Wage Hikes, Tax Receipts Get A LiftMutual Fund Strategists Like U.S. Stocks, Led By Tech, Health Care In A Sluggish Market

4,JCI,"U.S. companies are still desirable, but less popular targets for those in an acquisitive mood as the first quarter comes to a close.Mergers in the U.S. are down 40% year-over-year, marking the nation's lowest total global share for the January-March time frame since 2012, despite the competing bids to buy Starwood Hotels (HOT), according to Dealogic.U.S. target mergers and acquisitions volume totaled $248.2 billion, a 40% reduction from the $415.4 billion last year. U.S. target M&A comprised 36% of total volume during the quarter.Overall, global M&A volume fell 25% compared with a year ago, slipping to $701.5 billion. The number of deals has fallen 19% to 8,347. It's a year of tough comparisons, as 2015's first quarter at $934.5 billion was the biggest for deal making since 2007's record high of $1.1 trillion.Mergers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) fell 19% to $217.9 billion, the least of the three major global regions that Dealogic tracks. EMEA-targeted M&A comprises 31% of the global total, its highest quarterly share since the second quarter of 2013. Asia-Pacific targeted mergers comprises 28% with $195.9 billion of the global total, on par with 2015's first quarter.Chinese companies are among those with the biggest appetites for deal making, with ChemChina's $48 billion bid to buy Syngenta (SYT) being the largest on record for the quarter. The Johnson Controls (JCI) bid to buy Tyco International (TYC) for $16.6 billion is the quarter's largest U.S. telecom deal. Overall, telecom deals fell 50% to $39.7 billion via 151 deals, its lowest first-quarter volume since 2012.Starwood Hotels (HOT) finds itself in the middle of a merger love triangle, of sorts, with China's Anbang Insurance's $14.7 billion bid competing with Marriott International's (MAR) $13.6 billion bid for its rival hotel chain. The dining and lodging sector had its biggest first quarter for mergers since 2006, with $25.6 billion via 198 announced deals, much of the total dollar amount boosted by the Starwood bid.Technology was the quarter's top sector with $100.3 billion spent on 2,115 deals, up 10% year over year -- and containing its highest first quarter since 2000's $190.8 billion. Real estate was the second-largest sector, with $69.5 billion on 440 deals, though that was down 22% compared with 2015.Health care mergers plunged 56% to $58.7 billion, its lowest volume in four years, though it's the victim of tough comparisons as the sector had back-to-back record-breaking years in 2014 and 2015.Oil and gas volume was $24.9 billion via 208 deals, down 41% year-over-year and its lowest volume since 2005 and its lowest first-quarter activity since 2003. TransCanada's (TRP) $13.2 billion purchase of Columbia Pipeline (CPGX) is the biggest Canadian outbound deal in the energy sector on record.Finance M&A total $58.4 billion via 470 deals, making up 8% of the global total, its highest Q1 share since 2012. In that sector, Deutsche Boerse's $14.3 billion deal to acquire London Stock Exchange Group is the largest securities and commodity exchange targeted M&A on record.Goldman Sachs (GS) led global M&A among banks who advised on deals with $214.2 billion, followed by JPMorgan Chase (JPM) with $153.1 billion and UBS (UBS) with $98.7 billion.In comparison, some of the megadeals during the first quarter of 2015 were the $46 billion merger of Kraft Heinz (KHC), AbbVie's (ABBV) $21 billion bid for Pharmacyclics, and UnitedHealth Group's (UNH) $12.8 billion deal to buy pharmacy benefits manager Catamaran.

5,JCI,"Johnson Controls' proposed merger with Ireland-based Tyco International is designed to create a global manufacturing giant with combined estimated revenue of $48.6 billion in 2016.Company officials and analysts say the deal also will advance building heating and air conditioning systems maker Johnson's plans to morph into a global multi-industrial company and provide a tax benefit to the combined entity. Analysts say that could draw scrutiny from regulators.The merger announcement came less than two weeks after Johnson Controls (JCI) named the automotive-seat heating and cooling technology business it is spinning off ""Adient."" Johnson announced the spinoff last June and expects to complete it later this year.After the merger, which is expected to close by October, current shareholders of Johnson will own about 56% of the combined company and receive $3.9 billion cash. Shareholders of fire protection systems maker Tyco (TYC) will own the other 44%.""With its world-class fire and security businesses, Tyco aligns with and enhances the Johnson Controls buildings platform and further positions all of our businesses for global growth,"" Johnson Chairman and Chief Executive Alex Molinaroli said in a prepared statement.Johnson and Tyco businesses will combine under Tyco International, which will be renamed Johnson Controls PLC. It will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange as ""JCI."" The combined company will maintain Tyco's Irish domicile and global headquarters in Cork, Ireland. Its operational headquarters in North America will be in Johnson's home of Milwaukee, Wis.Tyco shares ended the day's trading down nearly 12% to 34.15 on the news, while Johnson lost 4% to 34.21.The combined company will save about $150 million a year in taxes by retaining Tyco's legal domicile in Ireland, the companies said.S&P Capital IQ analyst Efriam Levy reiterated a buy rating with 59 price target on Johnson Monday. But he thinks the merger could face regulatory hurdles.""Americans and representatives in Congress who control regulatory bodies don't like to see tax dollars fly abroad. That's what will happen here,"" Levy told Investors Business Daily.Johnson updated its guidance, saying it sees fiscal first-quarter earnings per share of 82 cents, ahead of the 80 cents-83 cents it provided earlier. Its revised guidance is in line with Wall Street views.Tyco's EPS is projected to be 42 cents, up from its earlier outlook for 40 cents and in line with estimates. Johnson will report earnings on Thursday, and Tyco reports on Friday.Johnson's EPS growth has slowed for two quarters, from 20% to 15% and then 7% last quarter. Consensus is for a weak 4% rise for the current quarter.

That was up from 91 cents the prior year and 3 cents above consensus analyst views. Revenue fell 13% to $8.7 billion, below estimates.The No. 1 U.S. auto parts supplier guided fiscal 2016 Q1 earnings of 80 cents to 83 cents a share. That's below the 84 cents expected by analysts prior to Thursday's earnings report.Johnson Controls looks to reduce its automotive supply business so it can focus more on growing its battery-manufacturing and building heating and cooling segments. In July, the company announced plans to spin off its low-margin automotive-interiors business segment into a separate publicly traded entity.In contrast, Delphi continues to expand its auto business. In its third-quarter earnings release Thursday, the company announced the acquisition of Control-Tec, a provider of software that analyzes vehicle testing events during the late stages of product development. This technology lets original equipment manufacturers reduce testing cycles, meet launch schedules and reduce warranty exposure.Delphi reported Q3 adjusted earnings of $1.28 a share, up from $1.16 a year earlier and a penny above estimates. Revenue fell 3.5% and came in below views, as unfavorable currency impacts offset continued volume growth, mainly in North America and Europe.The company guided full-year earnings of $5.15 to $5.25 a share, below analyst views of $5.30.Delphi's stock price sank 7.1% on the stock market today. Johnson Controls lost 1.3%.Goodyear shares declined 4.8% after it beat Q3 EPS views by 2 cents but missed on revenue, as its top line also was hit by unfavorable currency exchanges.

13,JCI,"Those most hurt by the Trump administration's planned tariffs on steel and aluminum could include United Technologies (UTX), Ingersoll-Rand (IR), and Johnson Controls (JCI), RBC Capital Markets warned.X In a noted dated Sunday, RBC Capital's Deane Dray also cautioned that Atkore International (ATKR), Eaton Corp. (ETN) and Pentair (PNR) would feel the pain especially.Trump set off a storm in the stock markets Thursday, saying he would impose tariffs of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports. While he said Monday that he doesn't think there will be a trade war, he added that the U.S. is ""not backing down"" on tariffs.Eaton has already sized the tariff impact as a potential 2% headwind to 2018 earnings per share, Dray noted.Overall, the tariffs would squeeze near-term margins for manufacturers of automobiles, HVAC systems, electrical equipment, and construction or building products, Dray added.Still, RBC expects multi-industry companies to eventually withstand the tariff  impact, citing strong underlying fundamentals in the manufacturing sector and the recent tax reform windfall.Shares of United Technologies closed up 1.4% at 131.71 on the stock market today, on reports that Republicans in Congress were pushing back more against the tariff plan. Ingersoll-Rand dipped 0.1%, Johnson Controls gained 1.6%, Eaton rallied 1.8%, Atkore gained 2.6%, and Pentair rose 0.6%.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

Start NowMeanwhile, Dray's RBC colleague Joseph Spak argued Friday that the near-term impact of steel tariffs on automakers should be minimal, given that they buy the commodity regionally and on contractual buys, but that the effect would be ""inflationary over time.""But Goldman Sachs warned Friday that higher steel costs could hit Ford's and GM's profits by $1 billion each, representing 12% and 7% of their 2017 adjusted operating income, respectively, CNBC reported.In addition, multinationals with high non-U.S. sales such as 3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) face risk of retaliation by U.S. trading partners, Goldman said.On Monday, Height Capital Markets said the White House is pushing to finalize and release its proposal for a steel tariff by late Thursday or early Friday ""in order to dominate the news cycle over the weekend in steel-heavy western Pennsylvania.""That could give Republican candidate Rick Saccone a boost in a special election for the U.S. House of Representatives on March 13, the firm's Clayton Allen wrote in his note.Allen, a former government policy advisor, warned that lack of progress on details, such as the legal justification for the move and compliance with WTO rates, could yet derail the tariffs. He expects the Trump administration may soften its position slightly to implement tariffs quickly, with exemptions on a country- and company-specific level a possibility.JPMorgan analysts believe quotas are a better option than just tariffs.""Among the three alternative remedies that Commerce Secretary (Wilbur) Ross had proposed to President Trump, option #2 (a tariff of 53% on all steel imports from 12 countries, with a quota by product on steel imports from all other countries equal to 100% of their 2017 exports to the U.S.) and option #3 (a 63% quota on the 2017 imports from all countries on all steel products) were the better alternatives in our view,"" JPMorgan's Michael Gambardella wrote the same day Trump's proposed tariffs were announced.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:These 5 Tech Stocks Are Setting Up After Finding Key SupportThe Big Picture: Bulls Pound The Bears For A ChangeTrade War Or Not, These 33 Stocks In The IBD 50 Share This Winning Trait2018 Stock Market Forecast: Smaller Price Gains, With A Foreign TiltWhere Is The Market Headed?

28,JCI,"Brazil's stock market edged lower Friday after official data showed the country's GDP declined for a second straight quarter in Q2, putting South America's largest economy officially in a recession.For the week, Sao Paulo's benchmark Ibovespa index rebounded from the lowest level in more than six years . That and a rally in Buenos Aires' Merval index in Argentina were two of the top performances among global benchmark indexes in a wildly unpredictable week of trade.Brazil's real swooned to a 12-year low and posted its worst month in a year that has seen its value drop 25%. Official data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics estimated GDP growth declined 1.9% in Q2, much worse than expected. In Q1, GDP fell 0.7%. Private consumption saw its worst drop in 14 years.Despite the week's gain by Brazil's stock market, the Ibovespa fell more than 6% in August, and is nearly 18% off its May peak.Also unclear in Brazil and Argentina was how stocks powered up while commodities prices — a vital element in both economies — posted a mixed week.Brent crude oil rose 10% for the week, and West Texas intermediate gained 11.7% — easily the best week for both since the oil price rout began in June 2014.But copper was flat and silver fell 6%. Spot iron ore prices were down 4% for the week, although futures rebounded from an early dive to post a 4% gain.Among Brazilian companies trading on U.S. markets, steel producer Companhia Siderurgica (SID) bounced 9% for the week, but remains deep in a multiyear correction. Water utility Comp De Saneamento (SBS) surged 5%. Beer and soft-drink heavyweight AmBev (ABEV) climbed 4%.Beyond South America, China's leading indexes continued to take a beating. The Shanghai Composite dived 19% through Wednesday, then trimmed its loss to 7.8%. The Shenzhen Composite narrowed a 19% dive to a 9.4% loss. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index fell 3.6% — its 12th slip in 14 weeks.But Asian markets outside China and Japan were generally strong for the week.South Korea's KOSPI benchmark gained 3.3%. In Taiwan, the TAIEX climbed 2.9%, while Jakarta's composite JCI in Indonesia rose 2.5%. The Bursa Malaysia KLSE in Kuala Lumpur notched a 2.4% gain.

30,JCI,"It's been a fantastic year for homebuilders, ranked among the top industries since May. That's made winners of a couple of ETFs, although one is well ahead of the other.X SPDR S&P Homebuilders (XHB) and iShares U.S. Home Construction (ITB) are both in IBD's ETF Leaders screen. Yet, neither is a pure-play homebuilding ETF, and the two funds are structured quite differently.That helps explain why iShares U.S. Home Construction has sharply outperformed, up about 57% this year compared with about 31% for SPDR S&P Homebuilders.SPDR Homebuilders (which holds 35 stocks) is only 33% invested in builders, while iShares Home Construction (with nearly 50 holdings) is more builder-heavy, with nearly two-thirds of the portfolio in those companies.Both also have a good share of building products companies: 33% for SPDR Homebuilders and 15% for iShares Home Construction. The rest of the portfolios consist of home furnishing, home improvement (Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW)), appliance and other companies related to the housing industry.The heavier reliance on homebuilders has indeed helped iShares U.S. Home Construction put up better returns in 2017.For example, D.R. Horton (DHI), which makes single-family homes in 26 states, has surged more than 35% from a breakout to new highs on Sept. 12. D.R. Horton is the largest holding in the iShares fund, with a 13.2% weighting. By comparison, the same stock occupies 4.4% in SPDR Homebuilders, which equal-weights its holdings.Because of that structure, winning homebuilding stocks have about the same weighting as fund laggards such as Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) and Johnson Controls (JCI).Both funds own the other major homebuilders that have rallied this year, such as Lennar (LEN), NVR (NVR), PulteGroup (PHM), Toll Bros. (TOL) and CalAtlantic (CAA).Chartwise, both ETFs formed three-weeks-tight patterns in the first half of December and are trading close to possible buy points. For iShares Home Construction, the entry is at 44.09 and for SPDR Homebuilders 44.59. The primary risk is in the lengthy advance both ETFs have enjoyed this year.The new tax bill cuts the amount of mortgage interest homeowners can deduct on their taxes, a measure that particularly hit luxury-home builder Toll Bros. But with the U.S. economy trending higher, many analysts maintain a positive outlook.""The National Association of Home Builders' index was released and it indicated that developers are near giddy,"" economist Joel L. Naroff wrote in a note Tuesday. ""The index is now above every reading we saw during the housing bubble.""The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

"
32,JCI,"Breaking up is hard to do, but sometimes it's for the better, especially when one party isn't investing enough in the relationship.To hear one analyst tell it, that's more or less what happened to Adient (ADNT), the automotive interiors heavyweight that spun off from Johnson Controls (JCI) last fall, little more than a month after Johnson completed its merger with Tyco International.""They stopped investing in new technology, they stopped investing in capacity, they didn't try to grow the business,"" Baird analyst David Leiker said of Johnson's management of the segment that included Adient. ""There wasn't a lot of interest in putting more capital into the business.""Even before its announced marriage to fire and security systems specialist Tyco, Cork, Ireland-domiciled Johnson Controls had begun pulling away from the automotive space three or four years ago — despite auto products making up about half of its sales — as it looked to fashion itself as a truly multi-industry company.That lack of interest motivated auto seating rivals Lear (LEA), Magna (MGA) and others to get ""pretty aggressive"" in taking market share, he said. And executives at Detroit.-based Adient, then called JCI Automotive Experience, were ""frustrated"" that the business was losing its edge under Johnson Controls.Post-split, Adient is a giant in its field, putting its market share at an estimated 34% globally. And its portfolio is exceedingly diversified, both by the automakers and geographies it serves.A little more than a third of Adient's business is done in North America, split fairly evenly among Ford Motor (F), General Motors (GM) and Fiat Chrysler Automotive (FCA). Another third of its consolidated sales are spread among more than half a dozen European carmakers. And 29% comes from Asia — mostly China — divvied up among Honda Motor (HMC), Nissan Motor (NSANY), Toyota Motor (TM) and Hyundai/Kia.It is nevertheless ""a business that, in some respects, is underperforming, because it wasn't invested in over the last three years,"" said Leiker, who has an outperform rating and 73 price target on the stock.But Adient is getting its groove back.In the first quarter of 2017, its first as a stand-alone public company, Adient recorded 13% profit growth to $2.12 a share, topping views for $2.03, with CEO Bruce McDonald touting the commercial-vehicle seating contract it won during the quarter, and a 14% increase in its three-year seating backlog to $2.4 billion. Its three-year backlog with joint venture Yanfeng Automotive Interiors grew to $2.3 billion.""You're seeing them make some of those investments that weren't being made, you see them going after contracts that they weren't going after before,"" said Baird's Leiker. ""They're winning business. They're taking market share, and really recouping a lot of what they lost during that time they were in limbo with Johnson Controls.""Aside from pursuing adjacent markets such as commercial vehicles, the company highlighted another growth driver during the call: automakers that could outsource their seating operations. During the quarter, Adient started manufacturing seating for the BMW 5-series, a task that was previously done in-house at BMW.""We've talked about the fact that there's still a pretty big chunk of the market available to us, especially in emerging markets with in-house players exiting the seating business, and same thing with smaller regional players (that are) shifting their production to big global players like Adient,"" said McDonald during the earnings call in early February.But revenue of $4.04 billion fell short of analyst estimates for nearly $4.2 billion, due to lower volume and other factors. The mixed results briefly weighed on shares, but most equity research pros appear to be positive or neutral on the stock.In late February, Morgan Stanley bullishly named the company its ""new top pick"" in the North American auto sector, and initiated coverage on Adient with an overweight rating and 95 price target. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas called out its ""growth and margin opportunities"" and its ""attractive risk-reward.""IBD'S TAKE: Since going public on Halloween last year, Adient shares have turned in a choppy performance, though have generally trended higher, going from around 45 on their first day of trading to past the 65 level. But the stock is well down the list of performers in IBD's automotive equipment group, which is led by Mobileye (MBLY).Adient is already unseating rivals in the hearts of some analysts. Jonas recommended that investors switch from Lear, and downgraded Lear stock to equal weight.""The nature of ADNT's business is powertrain-agnostic, insensitive to the move from internal combustion to (electric vehicles), which represents a significant challenge to many other suppliers under our coverage,"" he wrote.Elsewhere on the Street, Barclays rates the stock equal weight, while JPMorgan rates it at neutral. Both banks raised their price targets on Adient following its first-quarter report, in which the company reiterated full-year revenue outlook. Projections for $16.8 billion to $17 billion outshine current Street forecasts for $16.51 billion.At the close Monday, shares ticked down 8 cents to 67.79.A potentially problematic spot — ""if you want to pick on something,"" offered Baird analyst Leiker — is that the company has a great deal of exposure to China via its seating products and 35% stake in the Yanfeng joint venture.He is unperturbed, however, by murmurs that U.S. auto sales may have peaked after reaching record highs year after year.""Auto sales are at the same level that we were in 2001, which was the last cycle peak, but we have 10% more households,"" Leiker said. ""So everything else equal, car sales should be 10% higher. So we think that there's still some opportunity there.""And management is solid as ever.""I think they're doing a great job,"" said Leiker. ""They're on their own now, untethered, and they're going to be able to do things without someone above them telling them to slow down.""

63,JCI,"Your personal finance plan in 2017 will be like baking a cake. All you'll need is the right recipe. Whether you're investing in stocks, bonds, ETFs or mutual funds in a 401(k) retirement account, now's the time to check to make sure you have the right ingredients at hand.For Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors, the recipe involves six ingredients: overweight U.S. stocks in general; underweight 10-year Treasury bonds; and overweight financial services stocks, U.S. small-cap stocks, energy stocks and industrial companies' stocks.Orlando's colleague, Steve Chiavarone, associate manager of $414 million Federated Global Allocation Fund (FSTBX), cites holdings which illustrate that recipe. Among them, Apple (AAPL) could see higher profits if corporate taxes are lowered as President-elect Trump wants. It could also boost stock dividends or buybacks and spend more to develop new products with repatriated cash under Trump's tax proposal. ""Still, Trump has issues with parts of the tech industry, so Apple's may be a more mixed picture,"" Chiavarone said.In addition, a more lenient regulatory environment for banks would convert JPMorgan (JPM) from a something akin to a regulated utility back into a growth stock, Chiavarone says. Oilfield services giant Halliburton (HAL) should get more mileage out of its run, fueled by rising energy prices, he adds. And construction aggregates producer Martin Marietta (MLM) is poised to benefit from a boom in infrastructure projects.IBD'S TAKE: Martin Marietta is No. 2 in IBD's Building-Cement/Concrete-Aggregates industry group. To see how the company's growth metrics — like its strong 83 IBD Composite Rating and very strong 96 EPS (earnings per share) Rating stack up against its rivals, visit IBD Stock Checkup.To Orlando and Chiavarone, the 2017 recipe aims to take advantage of several macroeconomic forces now in play.In financials, $1.2 billion Third Avenue Value (TAVFX) lead manager Chip Rewey says U.S. regional banks are likely to benefit from rate hikes and scaled-back regulation. Their valuations are also relatively low ""since people have shunned them since the financial crisis.""Banks he likes include top holdings Bank of New York Mellon (BK), Comerica (CMA), PNC Financial (PNC) and Keycorp (KEY). All have strong Composite Ratings from IBD in the 80s or 90s.Among other stocks, he said home-builder ""Lennar (LEN) is a new position for Value Fund because housing should do well."" Its balance sheet is improving, it is reducing debt and it is trimming its land bank.He also recently bought shares in Johnson Controls (JCI). Some investors still think of it as a maker of automotive seating, a field it has exited. ""Its hidden gem is its car batteries,"" Rewey said. ""They are a leader in lead acid batteries and in start-stop batteries. And they, not Tesla (TSLA), are the leader in lithium ion car batteries.""In addition, Rewey likes biotech Amgen (AMGN), a relative newcomer to the portfolio, largely ""because the market is ignoring its strong pipeline.""And true to his value orientation, Rewey likes apparel company Ralph Lauren (RL). Earnings per share growth has declined eight straight quarters. The stock's Comp Rating is a dismal 7. ""But Rewey likes CEO Stefan Larsson's turnaround credentials. ""We think it's a great opportunity,"" Rewey said.Lee DeLorenzo, president of United Asset Strategies in Garden City, N.Y., says workers should try to take advantage of the same apparent forces in their 401(k) accounts. At the same time, they should cut their interest-rate risk by shifting 5% to 10% of their weighting in traditional bond funds to stable value funds or flexible, go-anywhere bond funds.She advises increasing exposure to small- and midcap stocks and stock funds. Plan members who can stomach risk, she says, should boost their weightings in financials and energy.Rich Weiss, a senior portfolio manager on a team that oversees 20 American Century target-date, target-risk and asset-allocation funds, says 401(k) plan members should also look at whether the year-end spurt in stock prices threw their target asset allocations out of whack. Does your mix of stocks, large and small, U.S. and foreign, specific geographies and selected sectors, still jibe with your overall financial plan? Your risk tolerance? Your financial goals?If something has grown too big, take profits to rebalance. Keep the proceeds inside your account to avoid an early withdrawal.Plan members who'd rather not make their own investment decisions should leave the heavy lifting to target-date and target-risk funds within their accounts, he says. If you do want to forge your own investment decisions, you can look for ideas at the asset allocations of target date and target risk portfolios that match your situation. ""But doing that may be more expensive and complex than simply purchasing an appropriate target-date fund,"" Weiss added.If your 401(k) does not offer target-date or target-risk funds? Consider investing that same money instead in such a fund inside an IRA, where your investment choices are almost unlimited.In addition, Weiss says, if your 401(k) offers a Roth option, use it if you are young and if your tax bracket will stay the same or rise after you retire. Meanwhile, contributions are not tax deductible. But earnings grow tax-deferred. And withdrawals normally will be tax-free, unlike withdrawals from a regular 401(k) or IRA.Suppose you share the Orlando-Chiavarone vision of what 2017 is to bring. How do you act on it?One approach would be to boost the assets, sectors and geographies that they expect to thrive by 10% in your portfolio. Trim from assets like long Treasuries and emerging-markets stocks. You can tweak those numbers up or down, depending on factors such as your time horizon, risk tolerance, long-term goals and any near-term need for cash.If you're an aggressive investor in your 30s, for instance, you might want to boost your U.S. small caps by 11% or 12%.In any case, first form your 2017 financial action plan, either with your financial advisor or on your own. Then look for securities that can bring that plan to life. It's not all that hard. In fact, reflecting holiday cheer, DeLorenzo said, ""The execution of these changes is as easy as baking a cake.""RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewHot Stocks That Made Craig Hodges A Top 2016 Mutual Fund ManagerWhere Mutual Fund Pros See Big Stock Gains In 2017Here's How To Decide Which Retirement Accounts To Fund First

64,JCI,"As an income investor, can you find promising stocks for the new year by surveying what worked well in 2016? Yes, and there are several reasons why.Many of last year's strong winners have emerged from early-stage bases, so they may have further potential to rise. Also, these stocks continue to exhibit the type of steady earnings that enable future cash payouts to continue for years to come.The prospect of future hikes in the quarterly dividends among these leaders also looks promising.The biggest winners that appeared in IBD's The Income Investor column included an oil and gas pipeline play that rose 133% for the year (Oneok (OKE)), a truck maker that rolled ahead 55% (Cummins (CMI)), a paper products titan that gained 41% (International Paper (IP)), and a railroad that chugged 40% higher (CSX (CSX)).Two of these companies hailed from the transport sector, and for good reason. The Dow Jones transportation average rose nearly 21% for the year, a real sign of overall confidence in the current economy.But other top-performing income stocks hailed from a fairly wide range of industries as the stock market showed broad gains amid a choppy year.Many of the 34 companies featured in this column that rose 20% or more in 2016 saw big climbs in the third and fourth quarters, sparked in part by Donald Trump's upset win over Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election. The businessman's pledge to boost manufacturing, coal and infrastructure rebuilding inside America's borders helped unleash a strong rally in market sectors that had lagged earlier in the year.Banking stocks affirmed this fury of sudden buying, and perhaps some short-covering too, as a stream of positive economic data on jobs, industrial output, spending and personal income helped convince the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December for only the second time in 12 months.The fed funds rate rose to a target range of 0.5%-0.75%, and the prospects of three additional hikes in 2017 are currently bright.Higher interest rates — so long as they do not damage the current level of U.S. spending, building, construction and lending — bode well for the banks that rely heavily on the spread between the rates they pay for deposits and the rates they charge for loans.No wonder, then, that Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) (annualized yield of about 2%), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) (3.6% yield) and Toronto Dominion (TD) (3.3%) made the top of the winners list with year-to-date gains of 26% to 35% each.Other financial services firms also prospered. Consider Principal Financial Group (PFG), featured on Sept. 16. The insurance and retirement services firm began the year with a thud along with the market, falling more than 26% in less than five weeks to a year-to-date low of 33.09, but then mustered a steady rebound.By the end of the third quarter, the stock moved into positive ground on the back of a solid 6% gain in second-quarter earnings to $1.15 a share. That snapped a five-quarter streak of profit declines. In Q3, Principal affirmed that the profit turnaround wasn't a fluke as earnings jumped 8% despite a 13% drop in the top line.Some heavy machinery, diversified operations and other types of industrial firms also excelled. They included Johnson Controls (JCI), Ingersoll-Rand (IR) and Illinois Tool Works (ITW).Johnson's 2.4% yield is just mildly better than the S&P 500's 2.0% payout. However, shareholders apparently liked how the expert in electronic security systems, valves, pipes and fire-protection products improved its profitability. Pretax margin improved to 11.1% in fiscal 2016 (ended in September), rebounding sharply from 7.7% in fiscal 2015.Johnson's 3-year Earnings Stability Factor of 4 is excellent on a scale of zero (highly stable profits) to 99 (wild). IBD research has found that profit stability is a hallmark of a company's ability to pay or even increase its cash payouts to shareholders.Ingersoll-Rand and Illinois Tool also boast low three-year Earnings Stability Factor ratings of 2 and 4, respectively.Notice how on a weekly chart, all three of these industrial giants broke long-term downtrends in February, then went on to build and break out of what IBD calls bottoming base chart patterns.A rally out of these refreshed first-stage bases is bullish for income investors who hope to buy a stock that may be emerging out of a slump, pays a decent dividend and has the potential to deliver toasty capital gains.RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewInvesting In 2017: The Case For A Trump Era Secular Bull RunInvesting In 2017: The Presidencies Since The 1980s And Which Industry Groups Shined BrightestInvesting In 2017: The Bottoming Base, A Valuable Chart Pattern For Income Investors TooInvesting In 2017: The Bottoming Base, Part II; Why Apple Formed One In 2009Investing With Success: Learn From Gerald Loeb, A Wall Street GreatThe Income Investor: Why South Korea Fined Dividend Leader Qualcomm

65,JCI,"A pair of stocks in IBD's Auto/Truck-Original Equipment group went in opposite directions during afternoon trading on the stock market today, as shares of Johnson Controls (JCI) moved higher while those of Gentherm (THRM) tanked, even though both beat quarterly earnings views.Before the open, Johnson Controls logged fiscal Q4 earnings of $1.04 a share, up from 95 cents the prior year and 3 cents above consensus analyst estimates. Sales gained 3% to $10.98 billion, also above views.Johnson Controls, which gets part of its business from supplying cooling and heating systems to commercial buildings, benefited from recent strength in the nonresidential building market. That strength helped offset weakness in Johnson's automotive unit, Sterne Agee analyst Michael Ward noted in a report.""Their performance in Building Efficiency and Power Solutions was better than expected, while Automotive Experience (car seats nad interiors) results were weaker than expected,"" he said.Johnson Controls shares rose nearly 3% to 45.66 in afternoon trading Thursday.Meanwhile, shares of Gentherm sank 11% to 39.08 even though it beat third-quarter sales and earnings views, as management guided full-year revenue well below consensus estimates.IBD's Auto/Truck-Original Equipment industry group ranks No. 119 of 197 industries tracked.

"
84,JCI,"Siemens (SIEGY) announced Thursday that it plans to spin off its $15 billion health-care division in one of the German engineering giant's biggest portfolio revamps as it narrows focus on energy, transport and factory gear.The company is seeking to list the asset, with details on the planned scope and timing to follow, Siemens said as it announced earnings. Profit from so-called industrial operations reached $2.68 billion in U.S. currency in the three months through September, little changed from the year-earlier period. Analysts had predicted an average of $2.62 billion, according to a Bloomberg survey.""Health care is one of the most attractive businesses, if not the most attractive we have in the company,"" Siemens Chief Executive Joe Kaeser said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. ""We want to focus it more.""U.S.-traded shares of Siemens climbed 4.2% in morning trades to just past 119.The plan for Siemens to list its health-care unit will further whittle down the company's sprawling portfolio, which includes high-speed trains, wind turbines and medical scanners. Over the past decade, Siemens has largely retreated from consumer-oriented products like phones, lightbulbs and hearing aids to focus on industrial applications. Among Siemens' biggest recent divestments was the Osram lighting unit, though Chief Financial Officer Ralf Thomas said it would be ""wrong to compare"" the asset with health care.The move reflects a larger trend among conglomerates of portfolio trimming and a stronger focus on core businesses. Royal Philips (PHG)spun off its lighting business in May to focus more on health care, while General Electric (GE) sold off its appliance unit to China's Haier Group for $5.4 billion in January.Siemens's health-care business competes with GE and Philips as the largest in the world. Following a successful turnaround more than a decade ago, the business has ranked among Siemens' most consistent performers, and the company has poured billions into acquisitions over the last few years to build up the diagnostics arm.IBD'S TAKE: Siemens shares have been in a flat base since late August, when they hit a peak of 122.84. The company ranks 22nd in IBD's Diversified Operations Group with Johnson Controls International (JCI) at the No. 1 spot.With a spinoff of health care, Siemens is betting the unit — over which it wants to retain control — can better capture growth and drive investments than would be possible if it remained a stand-alone business, according to Thomas. The division's weaknesses include ultrasound- and laboratory-diagnostic businesses that lag competitors, he said.""Not everything that glitters is gold,"" he said. The division also makes MRI machines and blood-gas analyzers.The announced health-care spinoff is a ""positive surprise"" despite the market expecting the move, said Ben Uglow, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in London. The lack of a more concrete timeline makes it hard to judge further and ""whether this happens in 2017, 2018 or 2019 is anyone's guess,"" he said.Kaeser has been shifting the company toward its energy divisions, which include its wind-turbine business, and the CEO said in the interview he doesn't expect any demand swings in that field from Donald Trump's ascent to the White House.Sales in the fourth quarter rose 3% to 21.95 billion euros, while orders slipped 14% after the company took in some large orders in the year-earlier period. The power and gas division led sales growth with a 10% increase, while process industry and drives was the only division to report a decline in sales, driven by increased price pressure. The division was also hurt by 199 million euros in charges related to job cuts in Germany.For the 2017 fiscal year, Siemens expects earnings per share of 6.80 euros to 7.20 euros. Kaeser had previously cautioned about rising geopolitical uncertainty that could dampen 2017 results, and he reiterated today that Siemens continues to anticipate ""headwinds"" for macroeconomic growth amid a ""complex geopolitical environment."" Sales growth will be between 1% and 2% in 2017, while the margin from industrial businesses will reach 10.5% to 11.5%, Siemens said.The company expects 85% of its underperforming businesses to reach target margins of 6% by the end of the 2017 fiscal year. Currently these businesses have an average margin of 3%.The company plans to pay a dividend of 3.60 euros per common share.

Also, on a P/E (TTM basis), the stock looks overvalued compared with the industry, based on respective tallies of 17.8x and 15.8x in the past three months.In the past three months, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock has lost 6% against the industry’s rise of 2.3%.Moreover, of late, the company has been suffering from higher costs and expenses, which weighed on margins in first-quarter 2018.  In the quarter, operating margin slipped 10 basis points. We believe that unwarranted rise in expenses might affect Fortune Brands’ performance going forward as well.Further, analysts have become increasingly bearish on Fortune Brands, as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings has trended down over the past couple of months, from $3.63 to $3.62, led by one downward estimate revision versus none upward.Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks from the same space are Atkore International Group Inc.

182,JCI,"The auto sector staged a comeback in March after sagging sales performance in February. A majority of automakers reported a rise in their March U.S. sales. A robust economy, product launches and fat discounts enabled auto players to witness a year-over-year rise in new vehicle sales. Even concerns over high interest rates and elevated gasoline prices could not deter Americans’ new-found liking for sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and pickup trucks, albeit at the cost of sedans and passenger cars.Per Autodata, auto industry sales rose 2.5% to 1,653,529 while new vehicle sales gained 6% in March. Moreover, the seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) was 17.5 million in comparison to 16.8 million, a year ago.Also, during the week, just prior to the March sales release, General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) reportedly said that it will do away with the age-old monthly sales report in favor of quarterly reporting. The U.S. auto giant is of the opinion that 30 days is too short to absorb short-term volatility, therefore rendering the monthly figures exaggerated. It feels that the quarterly reporting system would better provide the correct picture of the health of the company as well as that of the industry.Also, the electric vehicles (EVs) maker, Tesla, Inc. (TSLA  -  Free Report) published its production figures for first-quarter 2018, which totaled 34,494 vehicles, up 40% sequentially. This happens to be the most productive quarter in the history of Tesla. Out of the total vehicles produced, 24,728 were Model S and Model X, and 9,766 were Model 3. The Model 3 output increased significantly on a sequential basis. However, the company missed its target of producing 2,500 Model 3s a week by the end of first-quarter 2018. Actually, it produced 2020 Model 3 cars over the last seven days. Despite the production target miss, the first-quarter 2018 performance of Tesla looks encouraging.(Read the previous roundup here: Auto Stock Roundup for Mar 29, 2018)Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Per Fox Business, Tesla has announced that it will voluntarily recall 123,000 of its luxury Model S sedans across the globe to fix the issue of faulty steering components.The Palo Alto, CA-based company stated that the recall includes Model S vehicles built before April 2016 and is devoid of any Model X or Model 3 versions. The company explained that it has detected “excessive corrosion” in the power steering bolts of the recalled vehicles. This glitch might result in reduced power steering.The EV maker will repair damages by replacing the specific bolts in the power steering component. The company has also intimated its plans to contact the affected customers directly for scheduling an appointment once the parts are available in their respective regions.However, the recent recall has further added to Tesla’s woes, which is already grappling with several challenges, particularly with respect to the production of Model 3 sedan, the low-cost EV targeting the mass market. (Read more: Vehicles Recall Continues Unabated: Tesla, No Exception)Tesla carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).2.    In a pioneering move, General Motors has reportedly taken the decision to abandon its usual practice of reporting sales on a monthly basis in favor of quarterly reporting. The U.S. auto giant is of the opinion that sales releases every month do not provide the true picture of the company’s intricate operations or the health of the auto industry, as it includes short-term fluctuations. However, per management, quarterly sales releases will give a better idea about the same.Abandoning monthly sales reports can be attributed to a number of factors. It has been witnessed that the effect of volatility does not smoothen adequately in the 30-day period. This has sometimes resulted in exaggerated monthly sales figures. According to the automaker, incentive campaigns, abnormal weather or product launches tilt monthly sales figures up or down.However, the company intends to provide investors and others a less volatile, longer-term metric to evaluate its performance. Replacing the monthly cycle with a quarterly one is likely to aid the company in this respect. This is echoed in the statement of Kurt McNeil, General Motors’ U.S. vice president for sales operations, “Thirty days is not enough time to separate real sales trends from short-term fluctuations in a very dynamic, highly competitive market.” McNeil further said, “Reporting sales quarterly better aligns with our business, and the quality of information will make it easier to see how the business is performing.” (Read more: General Motors to Drop Monthly Sales Report, Enticing Others)General Motors sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

183,JCI,"Investors looking for stocks in the Security and Safety Services sector might want to consider either Johnson Controls (JCI  -  Free Report) or Allegion (ALLE  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Right now, Johnson Controls is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Allegion has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that JCI has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.JCI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 12.33, while ALLE has a forward P/E of 17.17. We also note that JCI has a PEG ratio of 1.12. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. ALLE currently has a PEG ratio of 1.34.Another notable valuation metric for JCI is its P/B ratio of 1.47. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, ALLE has a P/B of 15.83.These metrics, and several others, help JCI earn a Value grade of B, while ALLE has been given a Value grade of C.JCI sticks out from ALLE in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that JCI is the better option right now.

184,JCI,"Allegion plc (ALLE  -  Free Report) has settled to acquire ISONAS Security Systems Inc. (ISONAS) for an undisclosed amount. The deal is currently subject to customary closing conditions and will likely be concluded by early third-quarter 2018. Acquisition of this Boulder, CO-based company will reinforce Allegion’s existing technology portfolio, as well as align well with its channel initiatives.ISONAS owns premium edge-computing technology that produces non-imitable access control solutions for the non-residential end-markets. Additionally, ISONAS intelligent devices, such as integrated reader-controller, use power other than ethernet. This feature simplifies the installation process of the controllers and makes them cost effective at times of customer infrastructure utilization.ISONAS has a wide customer base, and a strong network of certified committed distributors and integrators. The company generated $6 million revenues in 2017.Allegion’s presence in the global electronics market as well as its existing channel relationships will likely improve with the ISONAS buyout.

185,JCI,"The fastest-growing economy of the European Union is set scale new heights. Touted to grow five times as much as Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland has gone from strength to strength in the past few years. With unemployment already near a 10-year low, the country has witnessed strength in its service sector as well as household spending.Further, under tight labor market conditions, wages in the country have risen steeply. Taking such factors into consideration, betting on stocks from Ireland seems prudent at the moment.IMF Chief Lauds Ireland’s EconomyOn Jun 25, the chief of International Monetary Fund Christine Lagarde praised the Celtic tiger’s growth and performance in the last few years. Lagarde was speaking at Government Buildings in Dublin after her meeting with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and the country’s Minister of Finance Paschal Donohoe.She stated that Ireland has picked up from her last visit to the country as the IMF chief in 2013. While economic growth increased steadily from 1.6% in 2013 to 7.8% last year, unemployment fell from 14.6% to below 6% this year. Also, this announcement comes right ahead of the publication of IMF’s annual report on the Irish economy.While praising Ireland’s economic resilience and prowess, Lagarde quoted John F. Kennedy in a bid to caution the country of international shocks. She said that “one should fix the roof when the sun shines,” advising the country’s policymakers to prepare for the “rainy day” as Brexit looms large.Lagarde cautioned the country of “potential shocks whether they come from trade and financing costs.” However, she remained positive about the prospects of the economy.EY Predicts Almost 5% Growth for the Celtic TigerPer the latest report by the financial accountancy firm, Ernst & Young on Jun 25, the Republic of Ireland is all set to witness GDP growth of 4.9% in 2018 and almost 4% in 2019. Further, the report states that an additional 236,700 new jobs would be added to the Irish economy through 2022.The report also confirmed that 21 financial services companies have vested their faith in Ireland in the sense that they have vowed to move the majority of their operations from the UK to the Ireland following Brexit. Consequently, the report named Dublin as the most-popular business hub post Brexit.Irish Service Sector Gathers SteamService activity in Ireland gained momentum in the month of May, staging a rebound after declining in the previous months due to harsh winters. Service activity surged to a four-month high in May. The Investec Services Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) increased to 59.3% in May from 58.4 in the previous month.Also, growth in the level of new business from abroad hit a two-year high to settle at 59.5%. Such growth was achieved on the back of increased purchase orders from Britain.4 Best ChoicesIreland’s growth in the past few years not only shows its resilience to the economic downturn in the EU but also makes it one of the most business-friendly destinations of the region. With the unemployment level near a 10-year low, higher wages and burgeoning service activity calls for investing in stocks from the country.In this context, we have selected four stocks that are expected to gain from these factors. These four stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

187,JCI,"We issued an updated research report on Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. (FBHS  -  Free Report) on Jun 12.This security and safety service provider currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Its market capitalization is approximately $8.4 billion.Let’s delve deeper and discuss the company’s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds.Factors Aiding Fortune BrandsFavorable Operating Conditions: We believe that security and safety service provider companies are poised to benefit from the strengthening of U.S. economy and healthy growth prospects of the global market. Considering the domestic housing market, increase in housing starts, as well as higher demand for repair and remodeling activities, will spur demand for Fortune Brands’ products.For 2018, the company anticipates home products market in the United States to grow 5-7% while the global market is expected to increase 5-6%.To leverage gains from such favorable operating conditions, the company has been diligently working toward solidifying its product portfolio. The addition of brands like Shaws of England and Victoria + Albert to the Global Plumbing Group in 2017 is worth mentioning here. These assets are anticipated to generate combined revenues of $45 million annually for the company.Reward for Shareholders: Fortune Brands ardently believes in rewarding shareholders handsomely, especially through dividend payments and share buybacks. Over the last five years, the company’s annual dividend payment has grown from 30 cents in 2013 to 72 cents in 2017. After an 11% hike in the quarterly dividend rate announced in December 2017, the company’s annual dividend rate now stands at 80 cents.Also, in April 2018, share buyback program of $150 million was authorized by the board of directors. This program has two-year validly and shares can be repurchased in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. This, along with $160 million left from the earlier $250-million program — which was authorized in December 2017 and is slated to expire on Dec 8, 2019 — allows the company to repurchase up to $310 million of its common shares.Growth Projections: Solidifying business of Global Plumbing Group, favorable pricing and its cost actions, as well as ongoing share buybacks, will benefit Fortune Brands in 2018. The company anticipates sales to grow by 6-7% in the year. Earnings per share (before charges/gains) are predicted to be $3.58-$3.70, higher than $3.54-$3.66 expected earlier. The mid-point of the revised forecast is well above the year-ago earnings of $3.08.Also, Plumbing, Doors and Security segments are anticipated to flourish in the year. For the Doors segment, sales are projected to increase in low-double digits, better than high-single digit to low-double digits expected earlier, on the back of the expansion in retail business. For the Security segment, sales are predicted to increase in mid-single digit while for the Plumbing segment sales will likely grow in the low-double digits versus high-single digit expected earlier.Factors Working Against Fortune BrandsPoor Share Price Performance and Valuation, Lower Earnings Estimates: In the first quarter of 2018, Fortune Brands reported weaker-than-expected results with earnings of 56 cents per share, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents by 5.08%. Also, net sales missed estimates by 0.4%. Revenues from the Cabinets segment were weak in the reported quarter, declining 3% year over year. For 2018, the company has lowered its sales growth projection for the Cabinets segment. It is now anticipating growth in the low-single-digit range versus mid-single digit predicted earlier.In the past three months, the company’s shares have declined 7.6% versus 6.6% decrease recorded by the industry. Also, on a P/E (TTM basis), the stock looks overvalued compared with the industry, based on respective tallies of 18.6x and 15.6x in the past three months.Moreover, earnings estimates on the company have been revised downward in the last 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.04 for the second quarter of 2018, representing a decline of 3.7% from its 60-day-ago tally. Also, the impact of three upward revisions in earnings estimates for 2018 was offset by two downward revisions, keeping estimates stable at $3.63 per share.Rising Costs & Expenses Raise Concerns: Fortune Brands is dealing with adverse impacts of rising costs and operating expenses. Notably, the company’s cost of sales in the last five years (2013-2017) grew at 6.8% (CAGR) while its operating expenses went up 4.7%. The trajectory continued in the first quarter of 2018 as well, with the cost of sales and operating expenses increasing 5.5% and 8.1% from their respective tallies in the year-ago comparable quarter. We believe that unwarranted rise in costs and expenses will prove detrimental to the company’s margins and profitability.Long-Term Debt: Fortune Brands is a highly leveraged company. In the last five years (2013-2017), the company’s long-term debt soared 33.9% (CAGR) while grew roughly 2% sequentially to approximately $1.5 billion at the end of first-quarter 2018. Also, the company’s total debt/total equity has increased from 13.2% in 2013 to 58% in 2017. It stood at 80.1% at the end of first-quarter 2018. We believe, if unchecked, high-debt levels can inflate the company’s financial obligations and put pressure on margins.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the industry are Axon Enterprise, Inc.

191,JCI,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Johnson Controls International plc (JCI  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Johnson Controls has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13.7, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 19.5. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Johnson Controls’ current PE ratio considerably below its midpoint (which is 17.5) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 14.2. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Johnson Controls has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 12.9, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Johnson Controls’ stock in the near term too.  P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Johnson Controls has a P/S ratio of about 1.1. This is substantially lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is noticeably below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Johnson Controls currently has a Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes JCI a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Johnson Controls is just 1.2, a level that is marginally lower than the industry average of 1.6. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 9.3, which is slightly better than the industry average of 13.6. Clearly, JCI is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Johnson Controls might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of C. This gives JCI a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The full-year 2018 has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days and none lower, while the full-year 2019 estimate has seen four upward and one downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the full-year 2018 consensus estimate has inched up 0.7% in the past two months, while the full-year 2019 estimate has dipped 0.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Johnson Controls International plc Price and Consensus  Johnson Controls International plc Price and Consensus | Johnson Controls International plc QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineJohnson Controls is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (top 10% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happen, this stock could be a compelling pick.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

195,JCI,"The earnings season is off to a solid start with decent performance across the table. About 133 S&P 500 members have already released their results till Jan 26. Total earnings for these companies are up 12.3% year over year on 8.8% higher revenues, with 81.2% beating earnings estimates and 78.9% surpassing top-line expectations. Based on the hitherto observed pattern, the October-December 2017 quarter is anticipated to register modest double-digit percentage earnings growth on a year-over-year basis.  Per the latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for all the S&P 500 companies are expected to be up 11.6% on 7.5% growth in revenues. This represents an improved growth projection from the previous quarter driven by a corporate tax overhaul and relatively healthy job data, which in turn boosted corporate earnings, stoked investments and trickled down to employees in some instances. Experts widely believe that earnings growth is likely to improve steadily in 2018 and beyond.The Industrial Products sector appears to be quite strong. For the sector, earnings are expected to improve 29.5% year over year while sales are touted to rise 13.7% due to higher investments for infrastructure development.Let’s take a sneak peek at four major Industrial stocks scheduled to report earnings tomorrow to see how things are shaping up for the upcoming results.Johnson Controls International plc (JCI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results before the opening bell.

198,JCI,"The first-quarter earnings season is in full swing with around 267 S&P 500 companies already having reported financial numbers till Apr 27. Total earnings for these companies are up 25.1% year over year on 10% higher revenues, with 76.8% beating earnings estimates and 73.8% surpassing top-line expectations. Based on the hitherto observed pattern, the first quarter is anticipated to register improvement in earnings and revenues.  Per the latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to rise 22.6% on 8.4% revenue growth, the highest quarterly earnings growth rate in the last seven years. This represents better growth projections from the previous quarter — courtesy of a corporate tax overhaul and relatively healthy job data.Given the ongoing healthy scenario, it is quite natural that most sectors should deliver an impressive performance. In fact, per the above report, 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors are projected to end the first quarter with double-digit earnings growth on a year-over-year basis. Only the Autos are expected to end the quarter with bottom line decline.One of these well-performing sectors is Industrial Products sector. According to the latest report, total first-quarter earnings of the sector participants are likely to increase 35.4% from the same period last year on 15.4% higher revenues.Currently, the sector seems to have regained its momentum after struggling with reduced investment in the energy sector, soft commodity prices as well as poor economic conditions in some developed and developing nations over the last few years. The rebound can be attributed to increased infrastructure spending as well as rise in manufacturing and mining activity.Given this backdrop, it will be interesting to wait and see how some of the Industrial stocks fare when the companies release their results on May 1.Emerson Electric Co. (EMR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results before the opening bell. The global technology and engineering company, which is a provider of innovative solutions for customers in industrial, commercial, and residential markets, surpassed estimates twice in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 2.8%.

206,JCI,"A few industrial products companies are gearing up to report quarterly numbers on Jul 27. The Q1 earnings season is in full swing, with about 128 S&P 500 companies having already reported results, reconfirming broad-based expectations of better-than-expected earnings (as on Jul 25).Earnings of these companies (accounting for 36.1% of the index’s total market capitalization) are up 7% on 4.2% higher revenues. (For more details, read our latest Earnings Outlook: Sizing Up the Q2 Earning Season). Of these companies, 77.3% have surpassed earnings estimates, with 70.3% coming ahead of revenue estimates.As per our latest Earnings Preview, dated Jul 21, data projects that the total earnings for the S&P 500 companies are now on track to grow an impressive 8.6% from the year-ago period, on 4.7% higher revenues. This is comparable to earnings growth expectations of 5.6% recorded at the beginning of the reporting season.The Industrial Products space (which accounts for about 2% of the S&P 500 index’s total market capitalization) is expected to chart one of the highest earnings growth rates this quarter amongst all Zacks sectors. In fact, its earnings are on track to be up 14.2% in the quarter, on 12.9% higher sales compared with the last year.Industrial products stocks have been performing well since the beginning of second-quarter 2017, with the industry gaining roughly 4.7%, outperforming the S&P 500’s rally of 2.7%. We believe that growth-conducive policies of the government and expectations of higher infrastructure spending drove the shares’ performance.Further, there are economic indicators which point toward a strong operating environment for the industry. Industrial production — which measures the level of output of manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors — grew at an annual rate of 4.7% in the second quarter, led by robust growth in mining and utilities. Additionally, new orders for U.S.-manufactured machinery rose 4.6% in the first five months of 2017, largely for the construction, mining and oil and gas field machinery. These indicators bode well for the industry.Let’s have a look at how some industrial products companies are positioned, ahead of their scheduled announcements tomorrow:Flowserve Corporation (FLS  -  Free Report) designs, manufactures, distributes, and services industrial flow management equipment worldwide. The company has a choppy earnings surprise history, having beaten estimates twice over the trailing four quarters for as many misses, for an average positive surprise of 3.6%. In the last reported quarter, the company surpassed estimates by 25%.Our quantitative model hints at an earnings beat for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company in Q2. This is because it has an Earnings ESP of +4.55% (the Most Accurate estimate of 46 cents being higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents), in addition to the favorable Zacks Rank.(For more details, read: Will Flowserve Pull Off a Surprise in Q2 Earnings?).For a possible earnings beat, the company should have the right combination of two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3. Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Flowserve Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Flowserve Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Flowserve Corporation QuoteSimilarly, we expect AGCO Corporation (AGCO  -  Free Report) to outperform estimates when it reports quarterly results.

It has an impeccable earnings history, having beaten estimates strongly each time over the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 40.4%. In the last reported quarter, the company exceeded earnings estimates by a whopping 88.2%.A favorable rank and positive Earnings ESP hint toward an earnings beat this season for the company.For the to-be-reported quarter, the company’s Earnings ESP of +2.89% and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 indicate that AGCO Corporation’s earnings will likely beat estimates this quarter.

Though the company’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP, its Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.

In Oct 2016, Johnson Controls completed the spin-off of its Automotive Interiors business into an independent, publicly traded company, Adient. These may have some adverse effect on third-quarter results.Also, deconsolidation of the automotive interiors business and negative foreign currency translation is affecting Johnson Controls’ results.

This trend is likely to continue in third-quarter 2017 too.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Johnson Controls this quarter.

208,JCI,"Johnson Controls International plc (JCI  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results before the opening bell on Jan 31.Last quarter, the company reported in-line results. Per its earnings record, it beat estimates in only one of the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 0.5%.Long-term earnings per share growth (three-five years) for the company is pegged at 13.3%.Johnson Controls International PLC Price and EPS Surprise Johnson Controls International PLC price-eps-surprise | Johnson Controls International PLC Quote Let’s see, how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.Factors Influencing This QuarterFor fiscal 2018, the company has provided outlook for adjusted EPS before special items within the range of $2.75-$2.85, reflecting an increase of 6-10% year over year.Further, to boost shareholders value, Johnson Controls has raised its share repurchase authorization to $1 billion in December 2017, which adds to the previously announced share buyback authorization of $200 million. Additionally, the company’s board has approved a hike in quarterly cash dividend to 26 cents per share from the earlier payout of 25 cents. This revised dividend was paid on Jan 12, 2018 to shareholders of record as of Dec 18, 2017.However, divesting its multiple businesses is adversely impacting the company’s profits and revenues. Notably, in October 2017, the company closed the divestiture of Scott Safety to 3M. Prior to this, in March 2017, the company had also completed the divestiture of its ADT South Africa business. Thus, these high separation costs associated with the divestitures are straining its revenues and profits.Johnson Controls is also vulnerable to volatility in commodity prices. Examples of highly volatile commodities used in the Building Efficiency business are steel, aluminum, copper and fuel while lead is used in the Power Solutions business.For the soon-to-be-released first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of Building Technologies & Solutions segment is pegged at $5.2 billion, down from the fourth quarter’s actual total revenues of $6 billion.Similarly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of the company’s Power Solutions segment stands at $2 billion, down from the first quarter’s actual net revenues of $2.1 billion.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Johnson Controls is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Johnson Controls has an Earnings ESP is +2.76% because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 53 cents and 51 cents, respectively. A positive ESP always indicates a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Johnson Controls carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which lowers the predictive power of ESP. Hence, this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive. Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few auto stocks worth considering from the same space comprising the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat this time around:BorgWarner, Inc. (BWA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.66% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company’s fourth-quarter 2017 financial results are expected to be released on Feb 8.

The company’s fourth-quarter 2017 financial numbers are supposed to be announced on Feb 20.Price PerformanceIn the last six months, Johnson Controls’ shares have lost 6.6%, underperforming the 1.1 decline of the industry it belongs to.  Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.
