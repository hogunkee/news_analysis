19,HPQ,"What accounts for USAA Aggressive Growth Fund's (USAUX) tidy gain so far this year? In terms of holdings, the credit goes to Amazon (AMZN), Mastercard (MA), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Booking Holdings (BKNG) (formerly Priceline).X They're among the fund's best performing stocks this year, and have helped propel it to a 6.17% gain going into Thursday vs. 6.09% for its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar and 2.35% for the S&P 500.But those stocks might not have had meaningful positions in the portfolio were it not for new fund managers John Jares and Craig Behnke, who took the reins of the fund in August last year.For the board of the USAA Aggressive Growth Fund, 2016 was the straw that broke the camel's back.After years of consistently trailing its benchmark — the Russell 1000 Growth Index — in 2016 the fund posted a return of 0.72%. That year the Russell 1000 Growth rose 7.08% and the S&P 500 Index gained 11.96%. The fund's parent company knew drastic action needed to be taken. It fired the subadvisors managing the fund, Winslow Capital and Wellington Capital, and gave it to two in-house portfolio managers, John Jares and Craig Behnke, in August 2017.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersSince then, the managers have looked at each of the 125 stocks in the fund and done their own fundamental research. They've sold many stocks, narrowing the fund down to a smaller, lighter, more concentrated portfolio of 80 stocks with the goal of hitting around 70.""I don't know what was going on before, but by virtue of having two subadvisors, it was over diversified, and had little chance of outperforming,"" said Jares. ""We want to differentiate ourselves based on security selection, keep the beta in line with the benchmark, and add alpha through stock selection. We're nearly done with the process. We have 15 names to go.""The fund kept the top five holdings: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), which is the parent of Google, Visa (V) and Amazon. It also kept Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL). Among the names sold were Alibaba (BABA), Expedia (EXPE), Citrix Systems (CTXS), Amdocs (DOX), Teradyne (TER) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS).They're not just selling. They've also been adding new stocks and boosting the concentrations of the ones they like. When they took over the fund, 15 stocks made up 30% of the portfolio. Jares said by the time he's done, 15 stocks will make up about 40% of total assets.""It's a tale of two different time periods,"" said Behnke. ""From Sept. 1, 2017, to Dec. 31, 2017, when we were in the process of turning over a lot of the portfolio, our performance relative to the Russell 1000 Growth trailed by 200 basis points."" Even so, the fund ended 2017 up 30.05% vs. the Russell's 30.21% and the S&P's 21.83%.Now that the fund is closer to the managers' ideal portfolio, from Jan. 1 through March 4, it beat its benchmark by 105 basis points.Jares said the fund has performed well because of its holdings in technology and the consumer discretionary sector. Despite this, the managers have reduced the fund's technology weighting to 40% from 46%. And they increased the consumer discretionary weighting to 16.2% from 13.1%. Overall, they've broadened the fund's sector exposures by diversifying the number of sectors, while concentrating the number of stocks.Among the new stocks, they like Vulcan Materials (VMC)) so much that it became a top 10 holding. Based in Birmingham, Ala., the company supplies crushed stone, known as aggregates, along with concrete and asphalt to make roads and bridges.""Those aggregates have seen nice pricing power,"" said Jares. ""And in an improving economy where you may have infrastructure programs coming down the pike, their volume outlook is excellent.""The company has grown earnings at a 48% annual clip the past three years, but the stock is 14% off its 52-week high and trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, a bearish sign.Edwards Lifesciences (EW), which makes catheters to treat heart disease, has grown earnings at an annual pace of 29% in the past three years.""The original estimates of that market were $3 billion over the next three to five years,"" said Behnke. ""But with lower death rates and lower complications compared to surgery, those numbers are so strong that the total addressable market increased and the current estimate is $5 billion. Through our research and our industry contacts, over the next 12-24 months estimates for that market could push to the $6 billion-$8 billion range by 2025.""Jares also likes HP (HPQ), which he expects to become a growth company again. Best known for making computer printers, HP, Jares notes, is launching a new line of copiers. As 3-D printing kicks in, the company will become a leader again, he says. Jares says he expects HP will see growth return in the mid-single-digit range.The fund charges a below average expense ratio of 0.81%.RELATED:Look At What Hot Stocks Are Driving This Market-Beating Mutual FundDow Retakes 50-Day As Apple Pegs New Closing High; Bitcoin Dives

22,HPQ,"The S&P 500 index and Dow Jones industrial average undercut their 50-day moving averages but on Friday those two indexes and the Nasdaq composite rallied strongly. Walmart (WMT) sold off as earnings, guidance and online sales were weaker than expected. Hot recent IPO Roku (ROKU) tumbled on its revenue outlook. Home Depot (HD) beat and gave bullish guidance. Fed policymakers seemed slightly hawkish. Rite Aid (RAD) agreed to an Albertsons buyout.X The major averages suffered modest losses through Thursday, closing near session lows several times, while the Dow Jones and S&P 500 index fell back below their 50-day moving averages. But on Friday, all three indexes surged more than 1%, closing the week higher. Walmart (WMT) and Roku were big weekly losers. Treasury yields popped to fresh four-year highs on Fed minutes, but they backed off somewhat.The world's largest retailer reported better-than-expected Q4 sales and same-store sales, but earnings missed estimates. U.S. online sales grew 23%, less than half Q3's 50% annual rise, as Walmart (WMT) struggles to compete with Amazon.com (AMZN). Walmart still sees 40% e-commerce growth this fiscal year. But its earnings guidance was light. Walmart online chief Marc Lore denied a report he might leave the retailer. Walmart said it will roll out a more-upscale home furnishings shopping portal. Walmart stock crashed 10% on Tuesday.Amazon, for its part, reportedly plans to roll out six more cashierless Amazon Go convenience stores after recently opening its first Go store in Seattle to the general public.Federal Reserve policymakers still backed gradual interest rate hikes in 2018 at their Jan. 30-31 meeting. But they see stronger growth prospects in 2018 than they did in December, in part due to the Trump tax cuts. Fed officials see inflation rising to 2% over time. The 10-year Treasury yield, already up sharply this year, rose to fresh four-year highs, pushing stocks lower Wednesday.

It's projected to buy back $4 billion in shares. Shares rose fractionally for the week.Chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) cut its offer to buy Qualcomm (QCOM) to $79 a share in cash and stock from $82 after Qualcomm raised its bid for NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Broadcom said Qualcomm's revised NXP offer amounted to a transfer of value to NXP shareholders. If Qualcomm's purchase of NXP doesn't go through, Broadcom will pay $82 a share. Broadcom has asked Qualcomm investors to vote for its slate of six nominees to Qualcomm's board at the company's March 6 shareholder meeting.Grocery giant Albertsons, under private ownership for over a decade, announced it would merge with Rite Aid (RAD). The combined company, which will be public will have a value of $24 billion, including debt. The deal comes after Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) gave up on an effort last year to buy all of Rite Aid due to regulatory objections, instead acquiring less than half of the smaller rival's stores. Merger activity is heading up in the sector as pharmacies look to keep market share in the face of growing competition from Amazon (AMZN).The Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 1.6 million barrels vs. the week prior vs. analyst expectations for a 1.9 million barrel increase, while production was steady at 10.27 million barrels per day.

HP Enterprise (HPE), the server, networking equipment and data center gear maker also gave upbeat Q2 guidance, hiked its dividend 50% and boosted its stock buyback program. Printer-and-PC maker HP Inc. (HPQ) also guided higher for Q2 and the full year. HPE and HP Inc. shares jumped Friday.Domino's Pizza (DPZ) came up short on sales, but its stock appeared to be propped up by a report saying that Burger King-parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) was thinking about making a bid. Quarterly same-store sales at Wendy's (WEN) also missed estimates. Jack in the Box (JACK) met expectations, and the company said it had declared a cash dividend of 40 cents per share. Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) was just shy on same-store sales. Wingstop (WING) shares fell Friday on a weak 2018 EPS outlook.MGM Resorts International (MGM) missed Q4 earnings per share estimates, while sales topped, helped by the casino-resort operator's opening of MGM National Harbor in December 2016. But U.S. same-store casino revenue was flat, and MGM sees weaker sales on the Las Vegas Strip in Q1.Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) reported Q4 EPS that beat estimates, revenue that just missed.

Copper revenue surged 52% on higher prices and an output boost, while BHP's iron ore division saw 4% growth.

The Turbo Tax software maker also narrowly exceeded revenue expectations with $1.165 billion. Bur shares fell Friday on weak guidance.OLED technology provider Universal Display (OLED) posted better-than-expected December-quarter results, but shares fell on disappointing sales guidance for 2018.

23,HPQ,"General Electric (GE) helped pace outperformance by blue chip stocks as the Dow Jones industrial average gained more than 1% at one point, but then cut the gains to around 0.6% in late-afternoon trading on Thursday.X GE, up 1.1%, does not have the same impact on the Dow as it once did. At 14.70, even a future 1 point rally, equivalent to a gain of more than 6%, would not significantly hoist the Dow industrial higher by much.The Nasdaq composite lagged, losing early gains to fall 0.1%, as names such as digital TV hardware play Roku (ROKU), LendingTree (TREE) and waste control products play Stericycle (SRCL) all fell sharply, weighing on the tech-centered index.The S&P 500 was up 0.1%. At 2731, the large-cap gauge is trying to rally back above its 50-day moving average after a follow-through took place on Feb. 14. A follow-through is a bullish signal that confirms a new tradable market rally could be underway.The Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) exchange-traded fund slumped nearly 0.7% lower. At 33, the collection of top-flight growth stocks is trading fractionally lower since Jan. 1. FFTY gained 37% in 2017.Winners led losers on the NYSE at one point by a comfortable 9-5 margin. On the Nasdaq, rising stocks virtually matched falling ones in number. But the Nasdaq is still the market leader since Jan. 1, up nearly 4.8% while the Dow industrials trail with a gain of less than 0.5%.At least six of the 30 components in the price-weighted Dow Jones industrials rose 2 points or more, including United Technologies (UTX). The industrial and manufacturing play burst back above the 10-week moving average near 132 in bullish fashion as shares rose more than 3% to 133.47 in volume running more than 50% above its 50-day average.United Tech, which makes aircraft engines, elevators and security systems, has been showing steady single-digit top and bottom line growth in most of the past seven quarters. But in 2018 and 2019, the Street expects earnings to accelerate, rising 6% to $7.05 a share this year and up 11% the next.United has risen 8% since rallying out of a five-month cup with handle at 123.38 in mid-December. At one point, before the intermediate-level correction flattened the market, United was up as much as 12.8%.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportReturning to GE, one of the positive developments for the former market leader is the fact that Wall Street is encouraged by major reform plans by the new CEO John Flannery. Proof? The 2019 consensus earnings estimate has been revised higher, now seen at $1.06 a share, up 10% vs. an expected profit of 96 cents this year.This means GE is trading less than 14 times expected 2018 earnings; the Boston-based company recently slashed is quarterly cash dividend by half.  So with a 12-cent dividend per share, the annualized yield comes out to 3.3%, which hardly puts a dent into capital losses caused by the stock's 16.6% slide year to date.The S&P 500 trades roughly 20 times trailing 12-month earnings and shows an annualized dividend yield of 1.8%. (You can track the yield of the S&P 500 at the top of the General Market Indicators page, a PDF link at the bottom of the daily IBD Big Picture column.)The challenge, however, for GE, will be to find new avenues to boost the top line. Healthy sales, delivered by innovative new products and new markets, are the mother of strong earnings.GE is certainly in danger of falling out of the Dow due to its sharply hammered stock price. The stock is more than 52% below its 52-week high and trading well below the 50- and 200-day moving averages, a clear sign of weakness.Former Dow Jones industrial stocks such as Alcoa (AA), which has been split into two public companies including Arconic (ARNC), suffered such a fate in late 2013.At the time, the aluminum giant traded well below 10 a share. Computer and printer titan HP Inc. (HPQ), formerly Hewlett-Packard, and Bank of America (BAC) also departed the blue-chip Dow due to miserable stock performance.On IBD Stock Checkup,Elsewhere, the Dow Jones utility average rebounded 0.9%. But at 671, the interest rate-sensitive index is still down 7.3% since Jan. 1.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond eased to 2.92%, signifying some bargain-hunting among fund managers, even as the U.S. dollar fell against both the euro and the yen. West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices rallied 1.6% to $62.66 a barrel.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on breakouts, top stocks, major indexes and financial markets.)RELATED:Where Is The Stock Market Headed?

25,HPQ,"Dell Technologies (DVMT), the computer and data storage giant,  is considering a range of options to raise cash and reduce a heavy debt load. Those options include an initial public offering or possibly purchasing the remainder of VMware[ticker symb=VMW] that Dell doesn't own.Dell is rethinking its structure three years after it, as a privately held PC company, merged with data storage leader EMC in a $67 billion deal. The Dell Technologies board plans to meet, possibly next week, to discuss strategic options, according to people familiar with the matter, first reported by Bloomberg. Dell may also decide not to make any such moves at this time, reports also said.According to the Bloomberg article, Michael Dell is considering bringing Dell Technologies public with an initial public offering.The portfolio of Dell Technologies includes PCs and servers, workstations, displays and gaming PCs, a cybersecurity unit and a cloud platform.

Start HereThe Justice Department said the megamerger would harm consumers because the combined media-and-telecom giant might extract higher prices for Time Warner (TWX) content from other video distributors, or try to withhold content from emerging rivals. The DOJ has asked AT&T (T) to sell off Turner Broadcasting or its DirecTV satellite business to gain approval. AT&T rejected the DOJ's claims and proposed conditions, suggesting President Trump's animus toward Time Warner-owned CNN was a key factor. The DOJ's move could chill other big mergers, analysts say.

Earlier this month, larger rival Home Depot (HD) beat views and raised its full-year forecast.The QuickBooks and TurboTax maker's earnings leapt 83% as revenue grew 14% to $886 million in the October fiscal first quarter, easily beating views.

39,HPQ,"It's hard to think of LogMeIn (LOGM) as an underdog anymore.This scrappy tech firm took on the likes of Cisco (CSCO), Microsoft (MSFT) and Citrix (CTXS) and pioneered remote access to desktop and handheld devices via cloud computing. Now it's turning its guns on targets like Salesforce.com (CRM), Oracle (ORCL) and Zendesk (ZEN).XEarly this year, it tripled in size overnight to become one of the world's top 10 Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS, companies based on revenue, thanks to its $1.8 billion merger with Citrix's GoTo business.""The company is well on its way to its three-year, post-acquisition targets, and we believe the cash flow opportunity still justifies a much higher stock price,"" JPMorgan analyst Sterling Auty wrote in a recent note to clients, after LogMeIn disclosed financial results for the third quarter. JPMorgan is a market maker in LogMeIn shares.Based in Boston, LogMeIn offers software tools for cloud connectivity and collaboration, secure device access, and remote customer support. For an increasingly mobile and global workforce, it offers products such as Join.me, for online meetings; GoToWebinar, for online seminars; GoToAssist, for online assistance; and LastPass, for online password management.Now LogMeIn is at that point where it's an established tech player, yet small enough with around $1 billion in annual sales to generate powerful growth.Thanks in part to a 23% annual pretax profit margin and 26% annual return on equity, LogMeIn ranks No. 1 out of 56 companies in IBD's enterprise software group. ServiceNow (NOW), Paycom Software (PAYC), Blackbaud (BLKB) and Salesforce round out the top five.Within its core markets, LogMeIn is growing fastest in what is known as the identity business. LastPass, a product that offers simple and secure access to apps, devices and data, is doing especially well.In an email interview with Investor's Business Daily, LogMeIn Chief Executive Bill Wagner described his company as a leader in serving small and medium businesses. LogMeIn also counts millions of individuals among its customers, as well as the largest technology providers such as Dell Technologies (DVMT) and HP Inc. (HPQ); the world's biggest telcos like Verizon (VZ) and Australia's Telstra; and familiar Silicon Valley growth names like Evernote and Dropbox.A key market where LogMeIn sees long-term growth opportunity is a realm known as Unified Communications and Collaboration. It's one that has emerged as traditional enterprise collaboration vendors such as Microsoft and IBM (IBM), as well as traditional enterprise communication vendors like Cisco, have made inroads into each other's turfs.""Prior to the (GoTo) merger, our popular Join.me product was a high growth disrupter in the collaboration market,"" Wagner said. ""Now we have products like GoMeeting, GoToWebinar, OpenVoice and Grasshopper, which essentially bolstered our annual (communications and collaboration) sales by an order of magnitude.""JPMorgan's Auty says LogMeIn built a successful franchise in remote access, then added several related high-growth businesses around that core, such as web conferencing. Yet he sees room for even more. Auty noted that LogMeIn hit a targeted $100 million in cost synergies a year ahead of plan, and revenue synergies are already starting to kick in. For example, LogMeIn consolidated 50% of data centers and is successfully cross-selling LastPass subscriptions to GoTo customers.Beyond software applications, Auty sees a ""larger opportunity"" in providing a cloud platform for companies tied to the Internet of Things.A LogMeIn spokesperson told IBD that the company's fledgling IoT efforts are centered on customer engagement and support. That could pit it directly against Salesforce's Service Cloud as well as Oracle and Zendesk.It's all showing up in the quarterly results. During the third quarter, LogMeIn logged triple-digit earnings and revenue gains, while cash flow from operations surged to $90.5 million, a hefty 33% of revenue. The company also raised guidance for profits and free-cash-flow margins for 2017 as a whole.Shares briefly shot to an all-time high of 129.52 but now sit 7% below that peak, undercutting a 121.35 entry they cleared in October. Still, they are up about 24% year to date, while the S&P 500 has risen 16% over the same period.Auty rates LogMeIn stock as overweight and upped his price target from 140 to 145.In February, CEO Wagner hinted at ""big ambitions"" while alluding to a next generation of cloud technologies.IBD'S TAKE: Software stocks and cloud players have a strong presence in the IBD 50 list of top growth stocks, where you can find new ideas for your investing watchlist.Just a handful of months later, the company acquired the Israeli firm Nanorep. An artificial intelligence, or AI, and machine learning expert, Nanorep already makes chatbots and virtual agents ""more human"" for hundreds of companies across the world, including Intuit (INTU), FedEx (FDX) and Vodafone (VOD), according to LogMeIn.The acquisition accelerates LogMeIn's efforts in the rapidly growing market for digital customer service — one that it expects to balloon from 3% of all customer service interactions in 2017 to 30% by 2022.Wagner told IBD that the $45 million Nanorep deal builds on his company's history of disruptive innovation.""We were an early innovator in the 'freemium' business model, a structure we relied upon for our organic growth in the early days of the company and one that has been copied by many other successful technology companies,"" Wagner said.That model, of converting free users to paid or premium subscribers, was successfully deployed by Join.me. It offered single-click, frictionless sharing of screens, showing up older rivals like Cisco's WebEx and Citrix's GoToMeeting. GoToMeeting is now part of LogMeIn's portfolio.Launched in October 2010, Join.me was recognized as the fastest-growing web-conferencing product less than five years later.LogMeIn is now looking to harness Nanorep's AI expertise across its entire, newly expanded suite of product offerings. With GoTo under its belt, the company says it supports 25 million users and 900 million conferencing minutes every month, as well as roughly 200 million customer engagements and 5 billion voice minutes every year.But as LogMeIn targets new markets, challenges await. Patent litigation could resurface and roil the stock, experts caution.

It is seen rising to $1.17 billion in 2018.LogMeIn's free cash flow, a key valuation metric, has especially impressed industry analysts. Its free-cash-flow margin is now expected to be 30% for the year and to expand to more than 33% in 2019, said Matthew Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets.Investors and analysts await the strategic road map that Wagner is set to discuss at an event on Dec. 19.""We think the event could be a catalyst as management updates longer-term targets,"" Hedberg wrote on Oct. 26, calling LogMeIn a ""favorite idea"" for the rest of this year. He rates LogMeIn stock an outperform and hiked his price target from 140 to 143.RELATED:Could This IBD 50 Software Stock Be The Next Cloud-Transition Star After Adobe?Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

57,HPQ,"Just as critics were sounding the death knell for Best Buy (BBY), Hubert Joly embraced the opportunity to breathe new life into the consumer electronics retail giant.Joly, who joined Best Buy as CEO in September 2012, knew he would have a lot on his plate when he was recruited for the job by search firm Spencer Stuart.""When I was approached in the spring of 2012, Best Buy was facing an all-you-can-eat menu of challenges,"" Joly told IBD. ""It was facing the threat of online competition.""In addition, it had leadership challenges. Joly's predecessor, Brian J. Dunn, was ousted. And the company's founder and top shareholder, Richard Schulze, was considering taking the company private.But Joly, who has a reputation as a turnaround and transformation expert, was drawn to Best Buy's tough times: ""I love challenges,"" said Joly.A major challenge was competing with the wrath of the mighty Amazon.com (AMZN).""From the outside looking in, there was the existential threat of Best Buy being killed by Amazon and being transformed into a showroom,"" Joly said. ""People would visit Best Buy stores, check out products and prices, and then buy them online. People thought we were dying.""Drawing on leadership principles shaped by his work as a consultant at McKinsey & Co. and by philosophical and spiritual work he did with monks at the Congregation of St. John, Joly has proved the naysayers wrong.Thanks to a transformation strategy called ""Renew Blue,"" Joly introduced in November 2012, Best Buy, the No. 1 consumer electronics retailer, has witnessed a strong financial revival. Joly declared Renew Blue over at the end of fiscal 2017. The company is moving into a new phase titled, ""Best Buy 2020: Building the New Blue.""""As a result of the turnaround we've implemented, we're thriving,"" said Joly, who added the title chairman to his post in 2015. ""If anyone asks who killed 'showrooming' in the U.S., that's us.""During the Renew Blue time period, same-store sales have been stabilized and Best Buy has grown earnings per share each year at an average rate of 9% per year, and it's topped Wall Street expectations for earnings per share in each of the past 17 quarters.""When I joined, we had only two problems — declining revenue and margins,"" said Joly. ""In the last four years, we've improved the top line in the U.S. incrementally and we've improved our profit margin by about 100 basis points. We've improved our return on invested capital by about 900 basis points from roughly 10% to 19%. And we've been one of the best performing shares in the market over the last five years, going from a low of 11 to mid-50s now, really five times since then.""Joly and his team have not only resuscitated Best Buy on the financial front, they've transformed it into a mighty competitor in its space.""Best Buy is the revenue market share leader for consumer electronics, and they are likely to remain in that position for many years to come,"" said Stephen Baker, vice president, industry analysis, at the NPD Group.Joly, 57 (he turns 58 on Aug. 11), grew up in France. He holds degrees from the Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales de Paris and the Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris.He began his career at McKinsey, where he was a partner. He worked there from 1983 to 1996. He left McKinsey to become president of one of his clients — the French business of Electronic Data Systems (now part of HP Inc. (HPQ)). There, he staged his first turnaround as a corporate executive, boosting flagging revenue and increasing the profit margin.Joly has a track record of improving struggling companies. That also includes hospitality and travel company Carlson, where he was president and CEO from 2008 to 2012.He says he learned a lot about leadership while he worked as a consultant at McKinsey — also learned a lot from clients.Joly also spent quite a bit of time with a couple of friends who were monks in the Congregation of St. John. He worked together with them and published a couple of articles roughly 20 years ago. One article was in a theology journal and the other was in a philosophy journal about the purpose of work and the purpose of corporate organizations.""I also did the spiritual exercises of Ignatius of Loyola, the Jesuit, to find my purpose in life,"" said Joly. ""There's a deep philosophical and spiritual underpinning to all this.""Such experiences led to what Joly calls the five ""Be's"" of leadership.Here are excerpts on the five Be's from a 2016 speech Joly gave at the French-American Chamber of Commerce Foundation gala:Joly says his philosophy of leadership is ""rooted in the metaphysics"" of work: Why do we work? What is the purpose of a corporation?""The best companies excel simultaneously on the three dimensions of people, business and finance,"" said Joly. ""But from a philosophical standpoint, the purpose is not financial, it's about contributing to the common good and contributing (to) the development of the individuals who work at the company and are touched by the company. And it's about developing positive relationships. It's a human purpose.""Joly takes a disciplined approach to improving companies, drawing on a type of ""manual"" he's developed on principles that underlie a turnaround.""In the context of  turnaround leadership, my leadership philosophy was about working together with management to turn around and transform Best Buy,"" said Joly. ""We worked together to develop a diagnosis of the situation and develop a framework of how to turn around Best Buy.""The purpose of the diagnosis is to uncover the main issues and performance drivers.""The most important thing is to build the right team and to do it very quickly,"" he added. ""Typically in a turnaround you have to change a significant part of the team. And you start at the top.""At Best Buy, Joly removed three leaders, promoted a few from within, and recruited from the outside.In his manual there are four drivers to a turnaround:Joly drew on his principles and philosophy to turn around Best Buy.Thirty days into the job, Joly and his team made a key decision: ""We decided we were going to be price competitive and we implemented a price-matching policy online,"" said Joly. ""People were coming to our stores looking for help (from sales associates). By being price competitive and matching prices and then leveraging our unit assets, there was no reason to leave the store without buying. This was a bold move.""So far, Best Buy has taken out $1.4 billion in costs. Joly says that's allowed Best Buy to make the investments in price competitiveness and improving the customer experience.To enhance the in-store experience, Best Buy has invested in adding many shop-in-shops developed in partnership with some of the world's foremost tech companies. These shops help vendors showcase the use of their technology and innovations.Best Buy has added shop-in-shops for such companies as Samsung, Microsoft (MSFT), Sony (SNE), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google.Best Buy has also invested in improving the customer shopping experience online. The result: Its online business has grown more than 20% a year, says Joly.Among other things, the team also improved the supply chain by leveraging Best Buy's store base to offer ship-from-store. Joly says Best Buy is shipping as fast as Amazon.Piper Jaffray analyst Peter Keith says Best Buy is winning share in the e-commerce space vs. Amazon.""If you look at the value proposition, it's equal and more likely even better to buy from Best Buy vs. Amazon,"" said Keith. ""You get the same prices and shipping terms — you can pick up (online orders) in stores and return items to stores. And you also get after market support. Their value proposition is arguably better than Amazon's for shopping for consumer electronics, which is allowing Best Buy to take back share.""Joly moved quickly to set Best Buy on the turnaround path and has continued to build momentum as it's taken shape.""If you try to ride a bike while standing still, you fall,"" said Joly. ""But if the bike is moving and not going in the right direction, you can adjust the course. In a turnaround, what's critical is to get things moving and build the momentum, and not worry about being too precise.""Helped turn around Best Buy, the revenue market share leader for consumer electronics.Overcame: The wrath of Amazon and positioned Best Buy to win share in the e-commerce space.Lesson: Follow spiritual and philosophical leadership principles.""There's a deep philosophical and spiritual underpinning to all this.""MORE ABOUT LEADERS & SUCCESS:For Bill Marriott, The Key Is Making Room For Innovation'Shark' Daymond John Wrapped His Brand In Hip-Hop MystiquePhil Knight Cleared Hurdles To Make Nike A Merchandising ChampionSupermodel Kathy Ireland Became A Role Model For Moguls

58,HPQ,"A sell rating was reiterated on 3D Systems (DDD) on the view that competitive pressure from HP Inc. (HPQ) in the 3D printer market will intensify.Piper Jaffray analyst Troy Jensen in a note to clients Monday reiterated a price target of 14 on 3D Systems with a rating of overweight, the equivalent of a sell.""We continue to believe the 3D printing industry has experienced an uptick in demand, but we remain cautious on 3D Systems given competition is intensifying and the bigger competitive risks are targeting its key products,"" Jensen wrote. He thinks HP will have ""a significant impact"" on 3D Systems' line of 3D printers in a category known as selective laser sintering.3D Systems stock fell 1.8% to close at 18.35 on the stock market today.HP made its long-awaited entry into the 3D printer market in May 2016.The competitive threat to 3D Systems and Stratasys (SSYS) is growing as HP is rapidly expanding its 3D printer business. Stratasys and 3D Systems are the two largest 3D printer manufacturers by revenue.Stratasys stock finished the regular session at 23.39, up 0.34%.IBD'S TAKE: Both 3D Systems and Stratasys are far off their highs from 2014 and have weak performance ratings, based on a variety of IBD metrics. They face increased competition from HP as well as from General Electric, which purchased two European 3D printing companies last year.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Weston Twigg in a recent research note said he recently spoke with HP's head of 3D printing, ""and traction sounds substantially better than we expected.""

59,HPQ,"Stratasys (SSYS) plunged Monday after it was downgraded to a sell by Goldman Sachs on a view that ramping competition and lack of exposure to the fastest-growing technologies in the 3D printer market will weigh on profit.Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Cabral in a research note Monday downgraded Stratasys to sell from neutral but left his price target unchanged at 20.Stratasys stock plummeted 11.7% to close at 24.39 on the stock market today. Prior to Monday's share-price drop, Stratasys stock was up 67% this year.Other risks to Stratasys, Nowak wrote, is the view that industry pricing for 3D printers needs to be ""meaningfully lower in order to drive adoption and hit break-even relative to traditional manufacturing."" A 2016 Gartner survey said price remains the most important factor holding back 3D printing adoption.Stratasys and 3D Systems (DDD) are the two largest 3D printer makers but are under rising competitive pressure. The biggest threats come from the entry of General Electric (GE) and HP Inc. (HPQ) into the market. HP entered the market last November while GE did so in September, through two big acquisitions of European companies.IBD'S TAKE: In today's stock action, Stratasys fell below its 50-day moving average, a negative sign, though it holds an IBD Composite of 80 out of a possible 99. Stock Spotlight lists 16 stocks with top fundamentals that could be getting ready to break out.GE said it's working on a massive 3D printer for jet engine parts. And Pacific Crest Securities, in a research note last week, said HP is rapidly ramping up its 3D printer business and threatens 3D Systems and Stratasys.Nowak also said Stratasys lacks exposure to higher-growth technologies, such as 3D printers that use metal-based technology.""We see risks to Stratasys' longer-term positioning within the industry without a metal lineup,"" Nowak wrote.Stratasys reported first-quarter earnings in mid-May that met Wall Street estimates as revenue fell 3% to $163.2 million from the year-ago quarter.RELATED:3D Printing Taps 4th Industrial Revolution; HP Discusses Big AmbitionsGE Rival Siemens, In 'Breakthrough,' Tests 3D-Printed Turbine Blades

60,HPQ,"Is Meg Whitman, chief executive of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), planning an exit strategy by year end?That's quite possible, says a Citigroup report, in light of HPE promoting company veteran Antonio Neri to the president's title last week.""We do expect Neri could eventually lead HPE (perhaps a few quarters away) and we note he has 20-plus years within Enterprise Group,"" Citigroup analyst Jim Suva wrote in the note to clients. ""That said, we do not expect Meg to exit HPE before the software spinoff is completed (scheduled for Sept 1).""HPE is selling off its software business to U.K.-based Micro Focus. HPE has already spun off its enterprise services business, which merged with Computer Sciences to create DXC Technology (DXC). Whitman's plans could be clarified at an analysts meeting expected in the fall. She oversaw the split of Silicon Valley pioneer Hewlett-Packard into two publicly traded companies in November 2015, with its printer and PC business becoming HP Inc. (HPQ). Whitman assumed control of HPE after the split.Before that, Whitman made an unsuccessful bid for governor of California as a Republican in 2010, though in 2016 she supported Democrat Hillary Clinton over eventual winner Republican Donald Trump in the presidential race.

""The business was characterized as rapidly scaling, with 3D printing viewed as a high-growth segment.""HP made its long-awaited entry into the 3D printer market in May 2016.""Customer feedback has been good and demand has been high since HP began scaling up operations, with many customers ordering multiple units."" Twigg wrote. ""The current platform is still somewhat limited in terms of materials and colors, but it is being expanded rapidly.""HP shares slipped 0.7% to close at 17.71 on the stock market today. 3D Systems was up 0.1% to 21.69. Stratasys was up 0.8% to 27.25.IBD'S TAKE: Both 3D Systems and Stratasys are far off their highs from 2014, and have weak performance ratings, based on a variety of IBD metrics as they face increased competition from HP as well as from General Electric, which purchased two European 3D printing companies last year.Growth in 3D printer sales decelerated in 2016, hampered by a slowdown at 3D Systems and Stratasys, the two industry leaders by revenue. According to Wohlers Associates, 3D printer sales grew 17.4% to $6.06 billion in 2016, year over year. That's down from 26% growth in 2015.Much of the downturn came from declines by 3D Systems and Stratasys, which together represented $1.31 billion, or 22%, of industry sales last year.

63,HPQ,"XGeneral Electric (GE) scored more than $31 billion in orders at the 2017 Paris Air Show, but some of its other interesting moves this week were in 3D printing.The industrial conglomerate inked 3D printing collaborations Wednesday with Swiss industrial heavyweight Oerlikon and French aeronautical company Lauak.GE said Tuesday it is working on a massive 3D printer for jet engine parts, describing it as the world's largest ""laser-powder additive machine,"" capable of producing parts that are one meter in diameter.""The machine will also be applicable for manufacturers in the automotive, power, and oil and gas industries,"" said Mohammad Ehteshami, vice president of GE Additive, in a statement.The announcements follow GE's acquisitions last year of leading European metal 3D printer manufacturers Concept Laser, Arcam and SLM Solutions as well as its creation of a stand-alone GE Additive unit, sharpening its challenge to 3D printer makers 3D Systems (DDD), Stratasys (SSYS) and HP Inc. (HPQ).GE has a self-described ""aggressive"" target of $1 billion in annual revenues by 2020 for its burgeoning Additive division; customers include Cessna-maker Textron (TXT).GE's 3D printer business has both near- and long-term implications for the company, said Jeff Sprague, an analyst with Vertical Research Partners, an independent equity research firm.""We see GE's additive strategy bearing fruit foremost in speed of prototyping and cost reductions on certain complex components,"" Sprague said in an email to IBD Friday. ""This, in turn, could accelerate GE's speed to market with new products or innovative solutions for its installed base, which should augment growth and profitability.""Using 3D printers can streamline designs, while enabling lighter and stronger systems than traditionally cast and forged parts. For example, GE has slashed the number of parts in its LEAP 3D-printed fuel nozzle to just one from 18.A more aggressive push in 3D printing could lift GE's top line at a key moment, as the company undergoes a leadership change after struggles to grow sales and profits have weighed on the stock, which is trading at roughly the same level it did three years ago.Meanwhile, companies like 3D Systems and Stratasys have grown more upbeat on demand for 3D printers in the industrial sector, as the technology moves beyond prototyping to more factory floors.GE shares rose 2 cents to 27.57 on the stock market today, but still fell 4.9% for the week.Despite the latest 3D printing announcements, shares of GE are poised for a weekly loss of nearly 5%.

Its results have been lackluster of late, though the company's outlook indicates a growth path ahead.Complicating matters is activist investor Carl Icahn, who has a piece of Conduent. The big question is what will happen if its turnaround starts clicking.""We think Conduent is an unlikely (merger) target,"" Keith Bachman, a BMO Capital Markets analyst, said in a recent report. ""We don't think any of the established BPO leaders, such as Accenture (ACN), IBM (IBM) or Genpact (G), have any interest in acquiring Conduent, given its focus on the low end of the market.""But others say a sell-off could come piecemeal.""(Chief Executive Ashok) Vemuri may choose to divest/sell portions of the business that are either 'noncore' or less profitable,"" said Frank Atkins, a SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst, in a recent note to clients. ""While this would have impact on top-line trajectory on a reported basis, it is a quick way to drive margin as well as restore balance-sheet powder for strategic investment. In our view, this could be in low-margin, more commoditized work, or in certain geographies which may not be of adequate scale.""In investor meetings, Vemuri has outlined plans to increase its sales force, invest in digital technologies such as data analytics, and focus on North America and Europe as core markets.What the company also wants to do is exit low-margin contracts and pursue new deals with better pricing. It aims to migrate toward higher-value-added work rather than being a soup-to-nuts services provider.""The core philosophy now is to drive a more repeatable, scalable and predictable business,"" Vemuri said on Conduent's fourth-quarter earnings call in February.  ""We are not in the business of trying to capture a headline by doing a big deal that we do not even understand how to start working on.""Regardless of what awaits the company, the split/merger strategy isn't unfamiliar. Silicon Valley stalwart Hewlett-Packard in 2015 split into two publicly traded companies: Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to focus on services and products for businesses, and HP Inc. (HPQ) to focus on PCs and printers.HPE in early April took a step further, spinning off its enterprise services businesses. But that entity merged with IT consulting firm Computer Sciences to create DXC Technology (DXC), now a rival of Conduent.Whether Conduent pursues a strategic direction similar to HP's remains to be seen. Xerox stock gapped up on Jan. 3, the day the spinoff was completed, and is up about 8% this year. Xerox is set to launch a slew of new products, aiming to spur revenue growth in the back half of 2017, analysts say.The move to split from Xerox was endorsed by Icahn, who built up a stake in the copy machine maker.Icahn now holds a nearly 10% stake in Conduent and picked three members of its board of directors. So he figures in whatever strategic options Conduent is looking at, analysts say.IBD'S TAKE: Conduent hasn't been a publicly traded company for long, but it's already is forming a cup-with-handle base that could lead to higher stock gains. Read here for more information on stocks forming cup bases.As its own entity, Florham Park, N.J.-based Conduent handles such services for businesses as state Medicaid payments, tollbooth collections, and other transactions.Along with Accenture, IBM and Genpact, a number of other business process providers compete with Conduent. They include Convergys (CVG), ExlService (EXLS) and WNS Holdings (WNS), as well as large multinational tech service providers including Automatic Data Processing (ADP), Cap Gemini (CGEMY), and the new DXC Technology.The worldwide BPO market is growing about 5% annually, says Citigroup. In 2018, it's expected to reach $197 billion, from $188 billion in 2017.As it grows, CEO Vemuri aims to provide multiple services to customers rather than spread out too thinly.""The thing we have to work on is to take various service capabilities, find the common thread between them, and sell (services) as a bundled solution,"" he said on Conduent's earnings call.Prior to joining Conduent last year, Vemuri was chief executive of iGate, an information services firm. France-based Cap Gemini acquired iGate for roughly $4 billion in 2015. Vemuri earlier worked at Infosys (INFY), an India-based consulting and tech services firm.Current results may not bode well for a takeover, though. Conduent's 2016 revenue fell 4% to $6.4 billion. Adjusted revenue in the December quarter fell 6.5% to $1.6 billion, below estimates.Conduent posted a fourth-quarter loss of $4.69 a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of 3 cents. Excluding a goodwill impairment charge and restructuring-related costs, Conduent said it earned an unadjusted profit of 29 cents per share vs. analysts' estimate of 23 cents. Analysts estimate that Conduent profit will rebound to 95 cents in 2018 from 75 cents this year. But it notched $1.06 in unadjusted profit last year.With a market valuation of some $3.2 billion, Conduent does not plan to repurchase shares or issue a dividend in the near term. Conduent has told analysts that if cost-cutting generates more free cash flow it could start making small acquisitions in 2018 to expand into new areas.Conduent has moved quickly to reduce its worldwide workforce to 91,000 as of Feb. 15, down from 96,000 at the end of 2016.While shares in Conduent are up about 7% since its spinoff from Xerox, Citigroup says one drag on Conduent stock has been that the company was not added to either the S&P 500 or midcap S&P 400 index post-spinoff, limiting its exposure to index investors.RELATED:Analysts Shoot Down Oracle-Accenture Deal; 'Why Buy The Cow?'

"
93,HPQ,"President Trump has visions of a massive Apple (AAPL) factory opening in the U.S. to churn out the latest iPhone. The idea is not completely far-fetched, but one thing seems clear: If it happens, most of the new jobs will go to robots.Even in lower-cost China, Foxconn, which assembles the iPhone there, reportedly replaced 60,000 workers with robots at one facility. That's more than half the facility's workforce. Foxconn says it is adding 10,000 ""Foxbots"" per year.China has seen its cost advantage wither away due to wage gains. It's investing more than $3 billion a year in robots — up from next to nothing before 2009 — to keep from losing its manufacturing base to lower-cost developing nations, Bernstein analysts Michael Parker and Alberto Moel wrote in a December report.Trump has vowed to rewrite or walk away from trade deals and cut corporate tax rates to level the playing field for U.S. companies. He told Congress on Feb. 28 that he'll ""bring back millions of jobs.""Although economists concur that North American Free Trade Agreement and China's admission to the World Trade Organization have taken a toll on U.S. manufacturing jobs, Trump's battle plan seems geared to fight the last war.If China must shrink its costs with a massive deployment of robots, U.S.-based manufacturers that pay much higher wages and benefits will face the same pressures.A 2015 study by Boston Consulting Group found that an automotive industry welder earned about $25 an hour, including benefits, while a robot could do the job for $8 an hour, including installation, maintenance and operating costs. The gap is expected to widen sharply as technology improves.""It is still possible to force the relocation of production"" by restricting trade via tariffs or applying political pressure, wrote Bernstein's Parker and Moel. ""However, if the point of the exercise is to restore well-paying, middle-class jobs in manufacturing in the process, the result is going to disappoint. Mandating a physical task be carried out in a high-cost labor market in 2017 is simply going to increase the chances the task is automated.""Trump relentlessly bashed air conditioning company Carrier during the campaign for its plan to close an Indiana factory and move the work to Mexico. He intervened in December, saving about 800 jobs — for now. But Carrier's parent, United Technologies (UTX), which is getting $7 million in tax incentives from Indiana to stay, said it would invest $16 million to automate the factory ""to drive the cost down.""Like Apple, United Technologies is a member of Dow Jones industrial average.United Technologies CEO Greg Hayes told CNBC that while moving to Mexico would have been cheaper, the company will ""make that plant competitive just because we'll make the capital investments there, but what that ultimately means is there will be fewer jobs.""Mondelez (MDLZ), the maker of Oreos, was another regular Trump campaign target for its decision to cut 600 jobs from a Chicago factory and move the work to Mexico. The company said it considered installing new production lines at its Chicago Nabisco plant but chose to do the work in Salinas, Mexico, because of a $46 million cost differential. Mondelez noted that even if the project had gone forward in Chicago, half the jobs would have been eliminated because of new labor-saving technology.IBD'S TAKE: Since taking office, President Trump has talked less about the sticks he'll use against U.S. trading partners and more about the carrots he'll offer to manufacture in the U.S. via tax reform. But, for now, Trump's economic agenda and his tax cuts for business are stuck in line behind the ObamaCare repeal effort.The food and beverage industry is expected to be among the bigger adopters of industrial robots in coming years, says Boston Consulting Group, with automakers and electronics firms continuing to lead the way. Metals and machinery, rubber and plastics, and pharmaceuticals and cosmetics are also seen ramping up robot use. A 2016 McKinsey & Co. study concluded that 59% of manufacturing activities could be automated.Foxconn said in January that it's mulling a $7 billion highly automated factory for making displays, including flat-panel TVs and monitors, in the U.S. in partnership with Apple. Transportation costs for ever-larger displays, which aren't shipped by plane like the iPhone, are a driving force behind the plan. Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou said March 1 that such plans are on hold as the company waits to see what bills are passed and what incentives are offered.Pegatron, another Apple contract manufacturer that does assembly for Dell and HP Inc. (HPQ) out of plants in California and Indiana, reportedly said after Trump's election that it could expand its U.S. capacity fourfold, relying on automation and with a minimal increase in labor. The tech industry began formulating its response last year in the event that Trump was elected and turned out to be serious about imposing 35% tariffs on imports from China.Trump hasn't threatened such hefty tariffs in recent weeks. The focus has shifted to House Republicans' plan to slash the corporate tax rate to 20% and make export revenues tax-free. The 20% rate would apply to the full value of imports, raising $1 trillion over a decade that would effectively pay for the corporate tax cut. Still, economists who back the idea say that the dollar would rise 25%, offsetting any trade advantage. Major importers like Wal-Mart (WMT) hate the idea and trade experts warn that the WTO would likely find the import tax to be illegal.Some companies haven't needed new tax deals or threats to open factories in the U.S., but automation is key to their strategies.Adidas is a prime example. The maker of athletic shoes, which has long done its labor-intensive manufacturing out of China, Indonesia and Vietnam, last year piloted what it's calling a Speedfactory in Germany, making shoes almost entirely by robots. This year, the second Adidas Speedfactory is slated to open in Atlanta, where it's expected to employ 160 people facilitating the production of a half-million shoes.The high-tech operation, Adidas says, won't just eliminate the drudgery in manufacturing (along with a lot of the workers). It also will enable the company ""to make product for the consumer, with the consumer, where the consumer lives in real time, unleashing unparalleled creativity and endless opportunities for customization.""Meanwhile, Nike (NKE), another Dow industrials component, and Under Armour (UAA) are both developing strategies for manufacturing in the U.S., close to their customers. It's a safe bet that robots will be doing most of the work.The implications for workers are clear, says Boston Consulting Group. ""As U.S. factories adopt advanced manufacturing technologies, demand will surge for higher-skilled, white-collar workers who can quickly adapt to new technologies and processes, and demand will lessen for blue-collar workers who are trained in specific skills.""Despite his vow to bring back millions of jobs, Trump isn't oblivious to the job threat posed by robots. In a postelection interview, the New York Times asked Trump whether he was worried that companies will keep their factories in the U.S. but automate their workers out of jobs.""They will, and we'll make the robots too,"" Trump said. He added: ""Right now we don't make the robots. We don't make anything. But we're going to. I mean, look, robotics is becoming very big and we're going to do that.""Trump is more right than wrong about the U.S. ceding an opportunity, writes Frank Tobe, publisher of the Robot Report. ""Two-thirds of the robotics industry and 100% of industrial robots are manufactured outside of the U.S. by non-U.S. companies.""China's leadership has fully embraced the adoption of robots as part of its ""Made in China 2025"" strategy. The plan reflects not only wage pressures but demographics, as its working-age population shrinks. Whether the U.S. will avoid committing to robots for fear of displacing workers is a real question with serious competitive implications.Academics and industry leaders made the case in ""A Roadmap for U.S. Robotics"" last fall that robots have been a plus for manufacturing jobs. ""Over the last 5-6 years we have seen introduction of 600,000 new jobs in manufacturing. During the same period, we have seen significant growth in adoption of robot systems in industry,"" they wrote.Yet their upbeat predictions come with some uncertainty. The auto industry has been the biggest adopter of robotics, but that's happened as sales rebounded from just 10.4 million in 2009 to a record high 17.5 million in 2016. But if demand has peaked, as industry players suspect, then increasing automation may not be quite so positive for employment in auto manufacturing in the future.RELATED:U.S. Manufacturing Gears Up As 'America First' Trump Takes OfficeThe Top 10 Jobs Robots Could Steal From Humans By 2025Forget The Doomsday Clock, There's Now A Robot Fear IndexThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade

94,HPQ,"3D printer maker 3D Systems (DDD) will report fourth-quarter earnings before the market open Tuesday, and it's expected to show continued struggles as the company undergoes a turnaround and faces increased competition.Wall Street expects Q4 revenue of $176.76 million, down 3.5% from Q4 2015 but up 13% from Q3. Earnings per share minus items are expected to fall to 17 cents from 19 cents in Q4 2015.Rock Hill, S.C.-based 3D Systems is under growing pressure from General Electric (GE), HP Inc. (HPQ), Siemens (SIEGY) and other companies that are pumping up their strength in 3D printers. The 3D print trade faces an array of challenges, ranging from the type and price of potential materials, to rethinking entire supply chains for portions of the industrial landscape.3D printer maker Stratasys (SSYS) reports its Q4 results before the market open March 9.IBD'S TAKE: Both 3D Systems and Stratasys are far off their highs from 2014, and have weak performance ratings, based on a variety of IBD metrics. IBD's Stock Spotlight lists 16 stocks with top fundamentals that could be getting ready to break out.3D Systems stock was up 2.7% to 16.94 in the stock market today, while Stratasys was up 2.5% to 20.94.The companies are the two largest 3D printer makers by revenue, but both have found demand failing to live up to the early hype of a 3D print revolution.Last April, 3D Systems announced that it had recruited Vyomesh Joshi to be its new CEO. Joshi had been executive vice president of the imaging and printing business of HP Inc.The 3D printer market stirred an investor and media frenzy in the three years through 2014.

95,HPQ,"3D Systems (DDD) reported a steeper-than-expected revenue decline, as the 3D printer maker undergoes a turnaround and faces increased competition from giants such as General Electric (GE), HP Inc. (HPQ) and others.3D Systems reported Q4 revenue of $165.9 million, missing the consensus estimate of $176.6 million and down 9.5% year over year. It's the biggest year-over-year sales decline in several years.It reported earnings per share minus items of 15 cents, down 21% vs. 19 cents a year earlier but beating the consensus for 13 cents.3D expects 2017 revenue of $643 million to $684 million with non-GAAP EPS of 51-55 cents. Analysts see 2017 EPS of 51 cents, but had forecast revenue of $684.8 million.Rock Hill, S.C.-based 3D Systems is under growing pressure from General Electric, HP Inc., Siemens (SIEGY) and other companies that are pumping up their strength in 3D printers. The 3D print trade faces an array of challenges, ranging from the type and price of potential materials, to rethinking entire supply chains for portions of the industrial landscape.3D Systems shares fell 10% on the stock market today, tumbling through their 50-day line. 3D shares have been consolidating since mid-April 2016.Stratasys (SSYS) stock lost 5.6% to 19.77, undercutting its 200-day.Stratasys reports its Q4 results before the market open March 9.

98,HPQ,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) said Tuesday it is paying $1.09 billion for data storage provider Nimble Storage (NMBL), which was also viewed as a takeover target of rival Cisco Systems (CSCO).HPE offered $12.50 per share for Nimble, a 45% premium to its closing price on Monday. That catapulted Nimble shares by more than 46% as they closed the regular trading session at 12.58. HPE stock was down 1.1% to 22.82, while shares in Cisco ticked up a penny to 34.20.Both HPE and Cisco aim to acquire technologies for next-generation data centers designed for cloud computing. HPE said in January it would buy privately held cloud software company SimpliVity, a rival of Nutanix (NTNX), for $650 million in cash.

The drop resulted in a failed near-breakout. Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock had formed a cup base with a buy point of 24.89, and shares came within a penny of that price on Wednesday. But Friday's fall of more than 8% below the buy point triggers a sell signal, in any case.The technology company — half of the former Hewlett-Packard that was split into HPE and PC/printer company HP Inc.

105,HPQ,"Frances Hesselbein was an unlikely candidate to lead a revolution at the Girl Scouts.Her only child was a boy of 8 when a church-based troop in Johnstown, Pa., asked her to fill in as the leader for six weeks while they found a replacement for the woman who had left on a mission to India. Finding the work with girls exciting, she stayed on for eight years and in 1970 was recruited to be the executive director of the Girl Scouts of Western Pennsylvania.She began implementing the principles of the father of modern business management, Peter Drucker, and the results caught the attention of the national board, which invited her to be interviewed as a candidate to lead the Girl Scouts of the USA in 1976.""I knew that since its founding in 1912, they'd always brought in some distinguished leader from the outside, but my husband insisted I apply,"" Hesselbein told IBD. ""Figuring I had no chance, I bluntly told them they needed to go through a radical transformation to be relevant. I was shocked when two days later they offered me the job, and for the next 13 years I never had a bad day!""By the time she stepped down, the makeover had turned the Girl Scouts into a growing and vibrant organization. Today, at the start of her own second century, she heads the prestigious Frances Hesselbein Leadership Institute.Born Frances Richards on Nov. 1, 1915, in Johnstown, she had just started at the University of Pittsburgh, hoping to become a playwright, when her father died of malaria contracted while serving the Army overseas. She dropped out to help provide an income for the family. Four years later, at 22, she married John Hesselbein and they worked hard to build a small photography and advertising company.When Hesselbein was asked to lead the troop of 30 10-year-olds, she taught them not only how earn money, but to save and invest it, and took them on field trips to expand their horizons ""during those eight glorious years,"" she said.In 1970, three business leaders she worked with on United Way fundraising urged her to take the job of executive director for the regional Girl Scout council, which was having serious financial difficulties. She agreed to do it only for six months to straighten things out. On her first day, she brought in six copies of Drucker's ""The Effective Executive"" for the staff to read.""There was a magic about Peter's writing,"" she wrote in ""My Life in Leadership."" ""He spoke to us in elegant, spare language that connected and inspired us, and moved us into the future. The vision he held before us embraced us; we made it our own. His philosophy gave us the courage to launch a quiet revolution. … Gone was the cold, austere command-and-control style of the old hierarchy. Alive and passionate were mission, values, people, accountability, and performance.""Four years later, she was asked to helm the much larger regional office in York in Eastern Pennsylvania, and her husband began working for the state council for the arts in nearby Harrisburg.When Hesselbein was made CEO of the national organization, membership had been in decline for eight years and was below 2 million, with 650,000 adult volunteers and staff. She instituted Drucker's ""circular management"" of widely distributed responsibility. The results included:""We focused on our mission, which was to help every girl reach her potential,"" Hesselbein said.By the time she stepped down, membership had climbed to 2.25 million, led by 788,000 adults.Hesselbein had attended a Drucker seminar in 1981 and often turned to him for advice. He told everyone that she was the best leader he had ever met (""she could run any company""). When she stepped down from the Girl Scouts in 1990, he recruited her to head his new Foundation for Nonprofit Management in New York City, which now bears her name.So what is the difference between leadership and management?""Leadership flows from inner character and integrity of ambition, which inspires others to lend themselves to your organization's mission,"" she said. ""Management is the set of skills that can help get things done. Unfortunately, its practice is too often a bag of manipulative tricks to advance someone's own interests, which creates cynicism.""Business can learn from the social sector how to define a mission that mobilizes talents and aspirations, Hesselbein said. Overall, corporations have been improving their leadership in the past decade as they have seen the results — in better morale and connection with communities — when employees volunteer their time. She cites MetLife (MET) and Mutual of America as two outstanding examples. She has done coaching for numerous Fortune 500 clients, including Wal-Mart (WMT), HP (HPQ), Boeing (BA) and IBM (IBM).Hesselbein said women should see themselves as leaders with special experiences who can help a company achieve its goals and play a vital role in society. They could prepare to assume the responsibilities of corporate governance by sharing their talents on the boards of nonprofit organizations.She has donated her archives to the University of Pittsburgh, which now has the Hesselbein Global Academy for Student Leadership & Civic Engagement. Kevin Kearns, a professor of public and nonprofit management at the graduate school of public and international affairs, said, ""Frances shares her key principles and invaluable insights about purpose, values, and ethics with a group of select students in our 18-month leadership development program. She holds an honorary doctorate not only from our university, but 20 others which have recognized her outstanding contribution and regard her as a national treasure.""Hesselbein's ancestors on both sides served in the armed forces and she has been a frequent speaker at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and other military institutions.In 1998 she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, as ""a pioneer for women, volunteerism, diversity and opportunity."" President George H.W. Bush also appointed Hesselbein to two commissions on national and community service.Hesselbein has spread the gospel of good leadership by editing ""Leader to Leader,"" the Institute's free, award-winning quarterly journal, and traveling to 68 countries. She is now also using interactive online dialogues, Skype, YouTube, and Twitter.Asked how she thought the institute might be different in five years, Hesselbein responded, ""There's a hunger for becoming better leaders all over the world, which is very exciting. We will be expanding our collaboration with powerful partners across the globe in all sectors, including free webinars for leaders at every level in poor countries.""Unmentioned by the Energizer Bunny of leadership: any plan to retire.Revitalized the Girl Scouts of America and now heads a prestigious leadership training institute.Overcame: No training or experience in running a national organization.Lesson: Great leaders get their troops excited by inspiring them to contribute to decision-making.""Pursuing a mission without achieving results is dispiriting; achieving results without a mission is meaningless.""""Good leaders make people's strengths effective and their weaknesses irrelevant.""""Communication is not saying something; communication is being heard.""""You should be a living example of what you are preaching.""""Dispirited, unmotivated, unappreciated workers cannot compete in a highly competitive world.""""The leader for today and the future will be focused on how to be — how to develop quality, character, mindset, values and courage.""MORE ABOUT SUCCESSFUL LEADERS:Nina Tassler Used Her Outsider's Insight To Succeed At CBS It's Been All Business For Packers Great, Entrepreneur Willie Davis Leaders Build Credibility On A Foundation of Integrity And Trust

106,HPQ,"In the personal computer industry, the big guys are getting bigger while the rest are shrinking.Among the major PC vendors, only the top three companies — Lenovo, HP (HPQ) and Dell Technologies (DVMT) — increased their PC shipments in the fourth quarter. The rest, including Apple (AAPL), declined significantly, research firm IDC said late Wednesday.Lenovo continued its reign as the No. 1 PC vendor worldwide in Q4, with 22.4% market share by unit shipments. The Chinese company shipped 15.7 million PCs in the fourth quarter, up 1.7% from Q4 2015, IDC said.HP was a close second with 21.7% market share in Q4. The Palo Alto, Calif.-based firm shipped 15.3 million PCs last quarter, up 6.6%.Dell was third with 15.7% market share, but posted the fastest growth among the top players in Q4. It shipped 11 million units, up 8.2%.Apple claimed fourth place with 7.5% market share in Q4, but its PC shipments fell 0.9%. Taiwan-based Asus was No. 5 with 7.4% market share, but its shipments tumbled 11.3%.Outside of the top five, the remaining PC vendors in aggregate saw their shipments fall 11.9%, IDC said.The total PC industry saw shipments fall 1.5% in Q4 to 70.2 million units.For the full year, PC shipments declined 5.7% to 260 million units, IDC said. PC sales were constrained earlier in the year by high inventories and free Microsoft (MSFT) Windows 10 upgrades.""The fourth quarter results reinforce our expectations for market stabilization, and even some recovery,"" IDC analyst Loren Loverde said in a statement. ""The contraction in traditional PC shipments experienced over the past five years finally appears to be giving way as users move to update systems. We have a good opportunity for traditional PC growth in commercial markets, while the consumer segment should also improve as it feels less pressure from slowing phone and tablet markets.""The top three PC vendors — Lenovo, HP and Dell — accounted for 59.8% of total PC shipments in Q4, compared with 56% in Q4 2015.Also Wednesday, research firm Gartner estimated that global PC shipments fell 3.7% in Q4 to 72.6 million units.

109,HPQ,"HP Inc. (HPQ) increased its personal computer sales in a challenging market during its fiscal fourth quarter, which helped return the PC and printer company to revenue growth after at least three quarters of decline.HP late Tuesday reported in-line earnings per share on better-than-expected sales for its fiscal Q4 ended Oct. 31. The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company earned 36 cents a share excluding items, up 20% year over year, on sales of $12.51 billion, up 2%. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected HP to generate sales of $11.9 billion, down 2%, in Q4.It was HP's first quarter of sales growth since it split from Hewlett-Packard a year ago. That transaction also spawned Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), which edged expectations with its earnings report late Tuesday.But HP's current-quarter EPS guidance disappointed investors. It expects non-GAAP earnings per share of 35 to 38 cents in fiscal Q1. The midpoint of its guidance is below the 38 cents expected by Wall Street.HP stock tumbled 6.8% to 14.86 on the stock market today, falling below its 50-day line.IBD'S TAKE: HP stock has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 49.

Sales in its printer and supplies unit fell 8% to $4.56 billion. Notebook PC sales rose 6% to $4.64 billion and accounted for 58% of revenue in the company's personal computer unit last quarter. Desktop and workstation PC sales also grew in Q4.

115,HPQ,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) late Tuesday reported fiscal Q4 earnings that edged Wall Street estimates, but revenue and its current-quarter EPS guidance came in light.HPE said non-GAAP earnings rose 17% to 61 cents in the three months ended Oct. 31, while revenue, adjusted for divestitures and currency, fell 7% to $12.5 billion.

HPE stock hit a buy point of 23.63 on Nov. 10, so it remains within buy range.IBD'S TAKE: Of the three large cap stocks in IBD's Computer-Tech Services group, HPE has the highest Composite Rating, a metric in CANSLIM investing. HPE's CR is 80 out of a possible 99, while Accenture's is 73 and IBM follows at 52. CACI International has a CR of 90, but it trades in low volume.Silicon Valley pioneer Hewlett-Packard split into two publicly traded companies in November 2015. It formed HPE to focus on products and services for large businesses and printer/PC maker HP Inc. (HPQ). HPE's rivals include Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Dell Technologies (DVMT).""During our first year as a stand-alone company, HPE delivered the business performance we promised, fulfilled our commitment to introduce groundbreaking innovation, and began to transform the company through strategic changes designed to enable even better financial performance,"" HPE CEO Meg Whitman said in the earnings release.HPE in May said it would spin off and merge its enterprise-services division with Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC). Then in September, HPE said it would spin off its software business and merge it with U.K.-based Micro Focus International. When those deals close in 2017, HPE could take one-time charges in financial results, analysts say.Some observers speculate HPE, with its remaining server, data storage, and computer networking businesses, could be taken private. Another scenario has Whitman making acquisitions to build up HPE's remaining businesses.Editor's Note: Corrected to show revenue and EPS guidance came in short of estimates.RELATED:Could HPE Go Shopping For Cisco Rival Arista Networks?HPE To Spin Off Software Unit, Slims Down As Dell Bulks UpWill Broadcom Chip Boost Arista Networks Vs.

119,HPQ,"The market for 3D printers got a vote of confidence Thursday after 3D Systems (DDD) reported third-quarter earnings that sent the stock higher.Shares of 3D printer rival Stratasys (SSYS) also rose. Stratasys is set to report Q3 earnings before the market open Nov. 15. Estimates on earnings and revenue also indicate a turnaround after a long struggle.3D Systems reported revenue of $156.4 million, up 3% year over year. That was below the consensus estimate of $160 million but it reversed four quarters in a row of revenue declines. 3D Systems attributed the revenue increase to higher sales of 3D printers and materials into production applications as well as strong demand for its software and health care solutions.3D Systems reported earnings per share of 14 cents, vs. 1 cent year over year. That was 5-cents above the consensus estimate, aided by cost cutting and tax benefits. It did not issue forward-looking guidance.IBD'S TAKE: Both 3D Systems and Stratasys are far off their highs from 2014, and have weak performance ratings, based on a variety of IBD metrics. IBD's Stock Spotlight currently lists 16 stocks with top fundamentals that could be getting ready to break out.The consensus for Stratasys is revenue of $174.5 million, up 4% year over year and reversing four quarters in a row of declines. The consensus on earnings per share minus items is 5 cents, vs. a 1-cent profit and reversing seven quarters in a row of declines.3D Systems climbed 3.1% to 13.48 in the stock market today. Stratasys stock was up 1% to 18.74.The 3D printer market stirred an investor and media frenzy in the three years through 2014. At that time, 3D printers were just taking hold in consumer markets and developing critical mass in some commercial and industrial settings. Big names, including General Electric (GE) and Boeing (BA), had begun to embrace the tools.But 3D Systems and Stratasys, the two largest 3D printer makers by revenue, ran into operational challenges as the real-world demand failed to live up to the initial hype of a 3D print revolution.Piper Jaffray analyst Troy Jensen, in a research note said he expects 3D Systems to benefit from the historically large system sales in Q4, but he says the company will still be challenged to sell printers due to industry headwinds, as well as internal challenges.""While we remain encouraged by the company's improved profitability, we believe the company's underlying fundamentals remain weak and continue to see material downside in shares,"" wrote Piper Jaffray analyst Troy Jensen in a research note. He reiterated a rating of underweight and price target of 10.50.Last month, Jensen issued a report that indicated a challenging market that was ""extremely discouraging"" for Stratasys and 3D Systems.In addition to sustained weakness in 3D printer sales, 3D Systems and Stratasys face the entry of HP Inc. (HPQ) (IBD). HP made its long-awaited entry into the 3D printer market six months ago, with plans to begin shipping product later this year.

120,HPQ,"Will it be a blue Christmas for consumer electronics vendors?Recent downbeat guidance from Fitbit (FIT) and GoPro (GPRO) points to a crummy holiday season for those gadget makers. The big question is whether other consumer electronics vendors will end up with coal in their stockings this quarter.Consumer electronics is a top sales category for the holidays. And it could be that Fitbit wearable activity trackers and GoPro action cameras have simply fallen out of favor with shoppers.As retailers and device makers prepare for the traditional kickoff of the holiday selling season on Black Friday, analysts are placing their bets on what the big gadgets will be this Christmas.Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY) likely will provide some commentary on what it sees as big sellers in the December quarter, when it releases fiscal third-quarter earnings on Thursday before the market open.IBD'S TAKE: Institutional money was rotating into new sectors after a wacky few days for stock markets following Donald Trump's surprise presidential win, but one thing remained constant: Facebook continued to be an IBD Leaderboard stock. This is the place to go to find leading stocks, which includes the social network leader even though a 5.6% drop on Nov. 3 triggered a sell signal for some investors. But it's more complex than that, as Leaderboard can explain.This past Thursday, Best Buy revealed its Thanksgiving weekend door-buster specials designed to entice consumers to come to its stores. It's offering steep discounts on 4K ultrahigh-definition televisions from the likes of LG, Samsung and Sony (SNE); ultraportable notebook PCs from Microsoft (MSFT), HP (HPQ) and others; and video game consoles bundled with software.The Consumer Technology Association predicts that U.S. holiday spending — covering all of November and December — on tech products will rise 3.1% this year to $36.05 billion, after rising just 1.4% last year.CTA Chief Economist Shawn DuBravac told IBD that retailers and consumer electronics makers waited until after the presidential election to begin advertising for the holiday season.The most popular tech item on holiday shopping lists this year is headphones, driven by the shift to wireless audio devices, DuBravac said. Other desired tech gifts include laptops, TVs, smartphones, tablets and video game consoles.Some 40% of shoppers plan to buy headphones as gifts this holiday season, according to a CTA survey.Apple (AAPL) has helped fuel the move to wireless headsets with its bold decision not to include an analog audio port on its iPhone 7 smartphones. It is selling Beats brand wireless headphones and will soon debut its AirPods wireless earbuds.Several vendors are looking to take on Bose this holiday in the subcategory of noise-canceling wireless headphones, Marjorie Costello, editor and publisher of Consumer Electronics Online News, told IBD.Bose released its QuietComfort 35 headphones for $349 in June. Sony followed in September with its MDR 1000X headphones for $399. And Plantronics (PLT) released its BackBeat Pro 2 headphones for $199 in October.""Those are not inexpensive gifts, but they're really good gifts to give anyone who travels,"" Costello said. Headphones are a no-brainer gift ""because everyone has ears,"" she said.Emerging product categories likely to see a boost in sales this year are drones, virtual reality headsets and smart home devices, DuBravac said.The CTA predicts about 1.2 million drones will be sold this holiday season, up 112% over 2015. That's despite the fact that GoPro issued a product recall and stopped sales of its just-released Karma drone. Market leader DJI is likely to benefit from consumer demand for flying-camera drones, such as its Mavic Pro quadcopter.The trade group forecasts sales of 700,000 VR headsets this holiday season. Those include premium VR headsets from Sony and Facebook's (FB) Oculus unit, as well as lower-cost smartphone-based headsets from Samsung and Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google.But NPD analyst Stephen Baker expects VR headset sales will be ""lukewarm"" this holiday season. ""VR will elicit a tepid response from consumers,"" he said in a report.The CTA also is looking for higher sales of smart-home devices this season, including voice-activated digital assistants such as Amazon.com's (AMZN) Echo and Google Home.Voice-enabled smart speakers that can play music on command, answer spoken questions and perform other tasks will be in high demand this holiday, NPD's Baker said.Ultra HD, or 4K, televisions will dominate Black Friday and Thanksgiving weekend sales, Baker said. Such TVs, led by sales of sets with screen sizes of 55 inches and larger, will account for 60% of TV dollars spent this holiday, he said.Holiday shipments of 4K TVs in the U.S. are expected to reach 4.5 million units, the CTA said. The trade group predicts full-year sales of 4K TVs will rise 40% over 2015 to hit 10 million units.PC sales, meanwhile, will be the best in at least four years this holiday as consumers upgrade to sleek new models, Baker said.Among product categories likely to disappoint this holiday is wearables, Baker said.""While prices for wearables may begin to decrease (especially in the fitness segment where competition is growing), expect a slight slowdown in sales as consumer interest fades,"" Baker said. That would be bad news for market leader Fitbit, which provided weak Q4 guidance.Another category facing a slowdown is action cameras, a market dominated by GoPro with its Hero cameras. The market for wearable sports cameras has matured and sales overall are poised to decline, DuBravac said.Other new products hoping to make a splash this holiday season are Snapchat's Spectacles, $130 sunglasses with a built-in camera; Apple's second-generation Apple Watch with new fitness features; and upgraded versions of existing game consoles, including Microsoft's Xbox One S and Sony's PlayStation 4 Pro and PS4 Slim.RELATED:Google Home To Overtake Amazon's Smart Echo By 2020: IHSSony PlayStation VR Aims To Make Virtual Reality MainstreamTeens Stoked About iPhone 7, But GoPro Is So Yesterday

121,HPQ,"Sentiment around HP Inc. (HPQ) is improving as the outlook for PCs and printers is looking up, RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said in a research report Sunday.Daryanani raised his price target on HP stock to 16 from 14, but kept his sector perform rating on the stock.HP shares have been rising ahead of the company's analyst day Thursday. HP stock rose a small fraction to 15.59 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: HP stock has an above-average IBD Composite Rating of 60, but there are more attractive stocks near buy zones.

122,HPQ,"HP Inc. (HPQ) stock sank on Friday, a day after the PC and printer maker announced plans to cut 3,000 to 4,000 jobs over the next three years and guided to below-consensus earnings and free cash flow for fiscal 2017, which starts Nov. 1.HP stock plunged 4.4% to close at 14.48 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: HP stock has a so-so IBD Composite Rating of 52. It ranks No. 3 out of 16 companies in IBD's Computer-Hardware & Peripherals industry group. To see which company leads the sector, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.At the company's annual analyst meeting on Thursday, HP executives presented their near- and longer-term goals from the company.Based on the midpoint of its guidance, HP expects adjusted earnings per share of $1.60 in fiscal 2017, vs. Wall Street's consensus of $1.61. HP is forecasting free cash flow next year of $2.5 billion, below the Street's target of $2.6 billion.HP raised its dividend by 7% and authorized a $3 billion incremental share-repurchase plan, bringing the total authorized amount to about $4 billion.The planned job cuts will start in fiscal 2017 and run through fiscal 2019. HP expects annual savings of $200 million to $300 million from the restructuring plan starting in fiscal 2020.When HP split from the former Hewlett-Packard nearly a year ago, it had almost 50,000 employees worldwide. But it expected to cut 3,000 jobs in fiscal 2016, which ends Oct. 31.HP CEO Dion Weisler described HP as a ""pillar of stability"" compared with its competition, according to Jefferies analyst James Kisner.""Weisler noted that its competitors are particularly distracted right now; Dell (DVMT) and EMC are merging, Lexmark (LXK) is being sold, Xerox (XRX) may be separating, and Lenovo is distracted with fixing its mobile and server segments,"" Kisner said in a research report. This environment should help HP gain market share, he said.Wall Street gave the HP news generally positive notices. At least four analysts raised their price targets on HP after the event.Kisner maintained his buy rating and 16.75 price target on HP stock.""HP sees fiscal 2017 as a transition year with a focus on stabilizing (its printing supplies business, and) fiscal 2018 is the year to accelerate growth with its key initiatives such as A3 copier and 3D (printing),"" Kisner said. ""We believe HP shares will appreciate as investors gain confidence in an improvement of the trajectory of PCs and printing businesses.""Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha reiterated his outperform rating and price target of 19 on HP stock.""HP management laid out a decent case for why the company could return to growth in revenue and EPS long term,"" Garcha said in a report. ""These include a change in business mix within (its PC unit to more premium computers), a model to optimize the supplies for (its) printing installed base, Samsung printer deal, and the optionality of 3D printing. While secular challenges in its end markets remain, we believe the valuation remains compelling.""In the PC market, HP is looking to sell more higher-margin machines, such as detachable tablet-notebooks and gaming PCs, as the overall market remains in the doldrums.In the printer market, HP is trying to find ways to improve ink sales and expand into new markets like commercial copiers and printers.CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino kept his buy rating on HP, but raised his price target to 17 from 15.""We expect printer supplies to remain a headwind in fiscal 2017, but note long-term growth initiatives (copier A3 penetration, commercial mobility and 3D printing),"" he said in a report.While several analysts were upbeat following HP's analyst day, others were from Missouri (the Show Me State) and took a wait-and-see stance.Mizuho Securities analyst Abhey Lamba maintained his neutral rating on HP, but upped his price target to 14 from 12.""We walked away (from HP's analyst meeting) acknowledging management's efforts to stabilize the PC and printing businesses,"" Lamba said in a report. ""However, we continue to see macro and secular challenges in these markets and believe HP's go-to-market and selling initiatives are unlikely to yield results in the near term.""Wells Fargo Securities analyst Maynard Um stuck with his market perform rating on HP, yet raised his valuation range on the stock to $14-$15 from $13-$14.BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long said he had ""generally neutral takeaways"" from the analyst day presentations. He reiterated his market perform rating and price target of 13 on HP stock.""Management is executing well on cost reduction and stabilizing the two businesses, but we believe headwinds will continue to dominate the story before the longer-term growth drivers start to contribute,"" Long said in a report.UBS analyst Steven Milunovich maintained his neutral rating on HP, but raised his price target to 15 from 14.""HP manages its business tightly, driving out cost, carefully pursuing profitable share gains in declining markets, and investing in adjacent markets,"" Milunovich said. ""Opportunities in A3 and 3D printing are promising, but will take time.""RELATED:HP Gains On Lenovo In PCs; Apple Mac Sales TumbleHP Stock Gets Price-Target Hike Ahead Of Analyst Day

123,HPQ,"A survey of 3D printer resellers indicated a challenging market in the third quarter that was ""extremely discouraging"" for market leaders' Stratasys (SSYS) and 3D Systems (DDD), according to a Piper Jaffray survey.Piper Jaffray analyst Troy Jensen collected feedback from 68 3D printer makers and service bureau operators, skewed toward Stratasys and 3D Systems.""The results were extremely discouraging for both Stratasys and 3D Systems,"" Jensen wrote in a research report. Both companies are likely to miss revenue estimates when they report Q3 earnings next month, he wrote. EPS is less at risk due to cost cutting by both companies, he said.IBD'S TAKE: Both 3D Systems and Stratasys are far off their highs from 2014, and have weak performance ratings, based on a variety of IBD metrics. IBD's Stock Spotlight currently lists 16 stocks with top fundamentals that could be getting ready to break out.Stratasys and 3D Systems are expected to report Q3 earnings in mid-November.The consensus estimate on 3D Systems is revenue growth of 5.6% to $160.2 million, and earnings per share minus items of 9 cents, up from a 1 cent in the year-earlier quarter. The company's earnings turned positive in Q2, rising 300% after five quarters of no growth or declines.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Stratasys revenue to climb 4% to $174.5 million, with EPS of 5 cents vs. a penny. It would be its first year-over-year profit gain in eight quarters.Stratasys and 3D Systems stock have both fallen for the last three days. 3D Systems stock closed Thursday at 14.82, down 5%. Stratasys fell 3.5% to 21.23.Among the reasons for the weak performance of the 3D printer market in Q3 is sustained weakness overall and the entry of HP Inc. (HPQ) into the market.HP made its long-awaited entry into the 3D printer market five months ago, with plans to begin shipping product later this year. Jensen and other industry analysts say some buyers have postponed purchases while they wait for HP to ship product.""We believe the biggest headwind continues to be increased competition, and believe the entry of HP and (privately held) Carbon 3D, as well as newer entrants, have caused customers to pause spending on traditional brands and assess these new offerings,"" Jensen wrote.RELATED:3D Printer Maker 3D Systems Eyes 'Inflection Point""General Electric Or HP Takeover Of 3D Systems Seen UnlikelyShake-Up At 3D Systems As Two Executives Depart 3D Printer CompanyGE Buys European 3D Printing Firms, Lifting 3D Systems, Stratasys

125,HPQ,"HP Inc. (HPQ) came within a hair's breadth of regaining the PC shipment crown from current leader Lenovo in the third quarter, market research firms IDC and Gartner reported late Tuesday.HP increased its personal computer shipments by 3.3% year over year to 14.4 million units in Q3, IDC said. Lenovo saw its PC shipments decline by 3.2% to 14.5 million units. Lenovo held on to the No. 1 position with 21.3% market share, followed by HP with 21.2%, IDC said. Lenovo took the PC shipment lead from HP in 2013.Gartner estimated that Lenovo had 20.9% market share in Q3, followed by HP with 20.4%.IBD'S TAKE: HP has an above-average IBD Composite Rating of 60, but there are better stocks out there. IBD's Stock Spotlight currently lists 16 stocks with top fundamentals that could be getting ready to break out.Overall PC shipments declined 3.9% year over year to 68 million units, IDC said. Gartner pegged the decline at 5.7%.PC shipments have declined for eight consecutive quarters, the longest slump in the history of the PC industry, Gartner said. The PC market has been negatively impacted by extended lifetimes for PCs and low demand in the consumer segment, especially in emerging markets where mobile devices rule, Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa said in a statement.Among the top five PC vendors, Apple (AAPL) posted the biggest drop in PC shipments in Q3, IDC said. Apple Mac shipments declined 13% year over year to 5 million units. The Mac product line is rumored to be in for a product refresh this fall.Dell came in third place for PC shipments in the third quarter, after Lenovo and HP, grabbing 15.8% market share. Apple came in fourth place with 7.4%, followed by Asus with 6.9%.The PC market is consolidating among the top vendors, IDC said. The top three PC vendors took just over 58% of the worldwide market in the third quarter, up from 55% a year ago and 51% in 2014.Q3 PC shipments came in better than expected, IDC analyst Loren Loverde said in a statement. An improving PC market would bode well for PC software leader Microsoft (MSFT) and chipmaker Intel (INTC).""We are very pleased to see some improvement in the market,"" Loverde said. ""Industry efforts to update products to leverage new processors and operating systems, to deliver a better computing experience encompassing more mobile, secure, and faster systems, and to accelerate PC replacements have been critical.""These improvements are accumulating, and set the stage for a stronger market going forward.""RELATED:HP Stock Gets Price-Target Hike Ahead Of Analyst DayIntel Stock Earns Price-Target Hikes On Apple, PC Developments

127,HPQ,"One chapter in Nvidia's (NVDA) rivalry with Intel (INTC) is nearing an end: Royalty payments from Intel that have boosted Nvidia earnings since 2011 could sunset next year — just as more competition unfolds between them in data centers, self-driving cars and augmented reality.Both Intel and Nvidia, whose stock has jumped 103% in 2016 after slipping a fraction on Friday, stick out as chipmakers hunting for the next killer app. Mobile phone sales are slowing globally, much as the PC market did earlier. Intel and Nvidia aim for leadership in semiconductors used in cars, artificial intelligence and visual processing.The moves into new markets are panning out, but Nvidia still gets 60% of revenue from PC graphics and gaming.Intel, which in Q2 derived 54% of its revenue from its PC unit, recently acquired startups in the AI and visual computing fields. Observers wonder what Nvidia might buy, with nearly $5 billion in cash on its balance sheet.But where Intel has had four chief executives since Nvidia was founded in 1993, Nvidia has had one CEO: Jen-Hsun Huang, one of Nvidia's three co-founders. The CEO gets kudos for reinventing Nvidia and for his ability to recruit top engineers to the chipmaker.""Jen-Hsun has made several gutsy calls in the past decade,"" Mark Hung, an analyst at tech research firm Gartner, told IBD. ""Some of them worked out very well, a couple not so much. When he sees an opportunity, he's been able to marshal the company's full resources behind it. In data center and automotive, they're charging ahead.""IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia's big year hasn't just been good for a chip company or for a tech company, but for any company. How good? The IBD 50 ranking of top-performing stocks over the past 52 weeks, with an emphasis on the most recent six months, is always a great place to find winners. Nvidia currently ranks No. 5 on that hard-to-make list.Huang is slated to deliver a preshow keynote address at CES 2017 in January and is expected to trumpet emerging gaming and AI technology, as well as AR headsets and self-driving cars. Its chips already help power the instrument and navigation displays in Tesla Motors (TSLA) e-cars and others.Nvidia continues to improve upon the high-end graphics processing that made it the leader in gaming, along with Advance Micro Devices (AMD). An Nvidia edge is that its powerful graphics processors, thanks to their ""parallel-processing"" circuitry, can be extended to artificial intelligence software.AI chips are well-suited for facial or object recognition, a plus for robotics and security applications, as well as spoken-language apps. Much R&D is focused on ""deep learning,"" an AI tool that enables computers to be trained and to perform actual reasoning. Self-driving cars map their surroundings and detect hazards, for example.In self-driving, Nvidia has ""the right product at the right time,"" said Malcolm Penn, founder and CEO of U.K.-based Future Horizons, a semiconductor research firm. ""Autonomous driving is all about vision and parallel processing,"" and Nvidia products are ""perfect for this; Intel ... is not.""Intel's chips still dominate in low-end PC graphics. And its chips are built into most computer servers packed into data centers. Nvidia's chips are gaining in data center gear as well, with technology well-suited for apps such as credit-card fraud-detection systems, says David Kanter, an analyst at Real World Technologies and the Linley Group.Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), Facebook (FB) and others are racing to develop AI-based apps that can be delivered to consumers via the internet cloud. There's another race underway to equip data centers with AI hardware and software.Intel's August acquisition of startup Nervana Systems heated up its rivalry with Nvidia. Nervana's technology processes ""deep learning"" algorithms. For its part, Intel last month acquired startup Movidius, whose visual processors are used in drones, virtual reality devices and autonomous machines.""Intel has only recently started to focus on machine learning and doesn't offer the same level of performance as Nvidia's latest products,"" Kanter said. ""The Nervana acquisition is an attempt by Intel to get expertise in machine learning and defend its territory in the data center.""For its fiscal Q2 ended July 31, Santa Clara, Calif.-based Nvidia's revenue jumped 24% from the year earlier, easily its best showing in at least four years. EPS ex items jumped 56% to 53 cents, its best showing in two years.But for its fiscal 2018 ending Jan. 31, 2018, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters are modeling only 3% full-year EPS growth. That's where the patent cross-licensing deal signed by Intel and Nvidia in 2011 comes in. Intel agreed to pay Nvidia $1.5 billion over six years, or roughly $264 million annually, to settle a patent dispute.In an email, Intel spokesman William Moss declined to comment on whether Intel plans to renew the agreement. Analysts say Nvidia has indicated there won't be a renewal.Nvidia can make up the Intel loss, says William Stein, a SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst. ""Nvidia's margins will be pressured in the near term for the nearly 90%-margin Intel-licensing revenue rolling off in 2017,"" said Stein in a research report. ""We believe this will be more than offset in the long term by growth in the high-margin data center end-market, plus new products in automotive, lifting margins above the corporate average. Increasing ASPs (average selling prices) in gaming will also help.""Some observers speculate that Nvidia could win back some PC business at Apple, where AMD's chips have recently been built into Mac desktops and laptops.Nvidia and AMD talked merger back in 2005. A deal would have created a bigger rival to Intel. Huang wanted to be CEO of the combined chip company, analysts say, and the deal fell apart.M&A has not been a big part of Nvidia's DNA, though it bought U.K.-based Icera for around $370 million in 2011. Nvidia had problems melding Icera's modem technology with its GPUs and wrote down the Icera business in 2015, says Will Strauss, president of market research firm Forward Concepts. While Nvidia has won some design wins in tablets, it's not a volume player in smartphones.With nearly $5 billion in cash on its balance sheet, Nvidia could be primed for acquisitions, Nomura analyst Romit Shah speculated in a September research report.With a market cap over $13.5 billion, Xilinx (XLNX) could be out of Nvidia's reach, but it's a potentially potent combo. ""Nvidia and Xilinx … now that would change the world as we know it,"" said Penn via email. Intel plucked down $16.7 billion in 2015 to buy top Xilinx rival Altera, which like Xilinx has a sizable data center business.Shah speculates that Nvidia might be interested in IBM's (IBM) Power family of processors. IBM and Nvidia have been partners in AI projects.Nvidia garners just over 10% of revenue from its data center business and, for now, only about 8% from automotive. Besides Tesla, Nvidia works with such automakers as Audi, BMW, Honda (HMC), Mercedes-Benz and Volvo, providing technology for infotainment, navigation, digital instrument clusters and advanced driver-assistance systems.Self-driving cars are one big battleground for Intel and Nvidia. Intel has teamed with autonomous-driving tech company Mobileye (MBLY) and Germany's BMW with the goal of bringing a self-driving car to market by 2021.Nvidia's highest-profile customer and partner might be Tesla Motors (TSLA). (Nvidia, by coincidence, has a line of AI and deep-learning platforms brand-named Tesla, but its Tegra line is what is used inside Tesla and other cars.) In August, Nvidia nabbed another biggie, announcing a partnership with China internet giant Baidu (BIDU) to make an autonomous car platform.Self-driving cars would be a big leap forward technologically for the chipmaker, says Kanter, but he says it's far too early to call Nvidia a winner of the race.""It's not clear to me how well Nvidia's expertise will translate outside of gaming and PCs,"" Kanter said. ""Automotive products are totally different from consumer electronics and the car manufacturers play a much more active role in system integration than a PC (maker) like HP (HPQ) or Dell.""There are many other companies that are more specialized in automotive.""RELATED:Nvidia Debuts AI Supercomputer Chip For Self-Driving CarsNvidia Could Provide Graphics Chips For Apple Mac ComputersIntel Among Chipmakers Getting Vote Of Confidence

The chip giant largely credited ""replenishment of PC supply chain inventory"" but also is ""seeing some signs of improving PC demand.""The midpoint of its Q3 sales guidance would be a 7.8% yearly gain, its best since Q3 2014.Intel's commentary on an improving PC business bodes well for PC makers HP Inc. (HPQ) and Apple, RBC Capital Markets said in a report Friday. Apple is expected to update its Mac computer lineup in October.UBS analyst Stephen Chin said PCs remain a driver for Intel's stock since the segment accounts for 53% of sales.""One outstanding question is whether this was a one-time benefit (for Intel's Q3) or the result of better consumer interest in new products and replacement of older PCs,"" Chin said in a report.In addition to improving PC sales, Intel is likely to benefit from better performance in its data center chip business, Nomura analyst Romit Shah said in a report Friday.""The Broadwell-E server refresh should drive stronger results in the second half of the year,"" Shah said.

129,HPQ,"HP Inc. (HPQ) on Monday announced a $1.05 billion deal to buy the printer business of Samsung Electronics, in a move to shake up the stodgy office copier market.HP said it hopes the acquisition will accelerate its goal of disrupting and reinventing the $55 billion copier industry. The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company wants to get customers to switch to more reliable multifunction printer technology and away from outdated, complicated copiers. HP said traditional copiers have dozens of replaceable parts and require frequent servicing to keep functioning.IBD'S TAKE: HP stock has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 46 and ranks No. 3 out of 16 stocks in IBD's Computer-Hardware and Peripherals industry group. To find out which company leads the group, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Samsung's portfolio of A3 multifunction printers deliver the performance of copiers with the reliability and ease-of-use of printers and with as few as seven replaceable parts, HP said in a press release.HP expects to complete the all-cash acquisition within 12 months pending regulatory review and customary closing conditions.After the deal closes, Samsung has agreed to make a $100 million to $300 million equity investment in HP through open market purchases.""The acquisition of Samsung's printer business allows us to deliver print innovation and create entirely new business opportunities with far better efficiency, security, and economics for customers"" HP CEO Dion Weisler said in a statement.Samsung's printer business also brings an intellectual property portfolio of more than 6,500 printing patents.HP said the deal will strengthen its position in laser printing, a category where it has a partnership with Canon (CAJ).RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani says HP will be able to lessen its reliance on Canon technology through the Samsung printer business acquisition.""There is a strategic element to this deal as HP currently licenses its laser print technology from Canon,"" he said in a research report. ""Samsung's laser technology could reduce its reliance on Canon. In this scenario, HP could see potential synergies increase beyond straightforward consolidation.""Daryanani said HP could reduce its cost-of-goods profile as a result of the asset purchase. He estimates Canon represents about 10% to 15% of HP's cost of goods.HP stock was up 3% to 14.49 on the stock market today. Canon's U.S. shares fell 1.4% to 28.63.The Samsung printer unit generates about $1 billion to $1.6 billion in annual revenue and could add 5 to 15 cents to HP's annual earnings per share, Daryanani said.

(HPQ) stock rebounded from early losses Thursday, a day after the PC and printer maker reported better-than-expected fiscal Q3 results but offered weak earnings guidance for the current quarter.HP shares closed down 0.2% to 14.37 on the stock market today, but they rebounded strongly from a morning sell-off to 13.55.Maxim Group downgraded HP stock to hold from buy and cut its price target to 15 from 17.Palo Alto, Calif.-based HP earned 48 cents a share excluding items, up 37% year over year, on sales of $11.89 billion, down 4%, in the quarter ended July 31. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected 44 cents EPS and $11.46 billion in sales.For the current quarter, HP guided to non-GAAP earnings per share of 34 to 37 cents, when Wall Street was targeting 41 cents. The shortfall was attributed to changes in HP's printer and ink business. HP is reducing its printing supplies inventory and aggressively pricing printers to expand its installed base.IBD'S TAKE: Earnings time can be volatile for stocks. Investors looking to reduce risks at these times might want to consider investing in options, and can get help with options as part of IBD's weekly Earnings Preview feature.""We believe management's decision to draw down printer supplies and increase product placement is the right decision for the long term,"" Wells Fargo analyst Maynard Um said in a research report. ""However, the near-term impact is now being felt in fiscal Q4 as these actions are pressuring margins without any offsetting gains the company had in previous quarters.""Benefits from its actions are not expected until the back half of fiscal 2017, which starts Nov. 1, Um said. He rates HP stock as market perform, with a valuation range of 13 to 14.""These actions should create a nice set up for HP in the future — low supplies inventory and high installed base of printers that should be in need of supplies replacement,"" he said. ""HP is sowing the right seeds, but we think it will take some time to bear fruit.""HP's key challenge is to stabilize its high-margin printer supplies business, FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi said in a report. But the printer business is in secular decline and HP's printer hardware installed base is shrinking.Seyrafi reiterated his rating on HP stock of sector perform, with a price target of 13.RELATED:HP Stock Tumbles In Late Trading On Weak Earnings Outlook

132,HPQ,"Analysts don't see any near-term brightening of the picture for 3D Systems (DDD), after the 3D printer maker's Q&A at a trade show Monday.The 3D printer industry emerged with a flourish from 2009 to 2013, only to crash in the next couple of years when it turned out that industry hype — the printers make products out of plastics, metals and other materials — has gotten ahead of reality in both the industrial and consumer segments.Longer term, though, prospects remain bullish, so much so that HP Inc. (HPQ) and General Electric (GE) have recently entered the market, just another hurdle for 3D Systems and its longtime top rival, Stratasys (SSYS).IBD'S TAKE: For all its challenges, 3D Systems sports a good IBD Relative Strength Rating of 90, meaning it's performed in the top 10% of all stocks over the past year. And it gets good ""green"" ratings on three key metrics, along with bad ""red"" ratings on another three key metrics, as shown in IBD Stock Checkup.But those companies entered the market for a reason. 3D Systems' new CEO, Vyomesh Joshi, who joined this year after helping guide HP's printer business to the top — and other top executives, a number of whom also came from HP — said the company ""is at an inflection point as the 3D printing industry transitions over the next three years from prototyping to production,"" Needham analyst James Ricchiuti related in a research note Tuesday.But Ricchiuti maintained a hold rating on 3D Systems stock, writing that executives ""conceded that more work needs to be done in terms of meeting all of the major customer requirements (speed, durability, repeatability and total cost of ownership).""The company did not update its financial guidance in the session, held at the start of the International Manufacturing Technology Show in Chicago.In terms of financial guidance, CFO John McMullen, one of the former HP execs at 3D Systems, ""suggested ... there is an opportunity for revenue and EPS growth in 2017,"" Pacific Crest Securities analyst Weston Twigg reported in a research note late Monday. But Twigg said ""we think this should be a minimum goal post,"" and ""we expect more aggressive goals to be rolled out through 2017 as operational improvements are accomplished.""Pac Crest maintained its sector weight rating on 3D Systems, which has seen its year-over-year revenue fall in each of the past four quarters.3D Systems on Monday announced a collaboration with computer-aided design company PTC (PTC), with 3D Systems' technology integrated into PTC's CAD platform. Analysts quoted CEO Joshi as saying that collaborations, not acquisitions, will be the company's style, and as conceding that the company has done a poor job of integrating its acquisitions.3D Systems stock fell 2.1% in the stock market today, to 15.16, but it's still up nearly 75% for the year. PTC stock fell 1.1%, to 43.11.RELATED:3D Systems Takeover By GE Or HP Seen Unlikely3D Systems, Stratasys Building Bases

133,HPQ,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) will spin off its software business and merge it with U.K.-based Micro Focus International, continuing a restructuring of one of Silicon Valley's venerable companies amid the rise of cloud computing.HPE said it will receive $2.5 billion in cash and its shareholders will own 50.1% of the new company.HPE late Wednesday also said fiscal Q3 non-GAAP earnings rose 9% in the three months ended July 31 to 49 cents per share, topping estimates. Revenue fell 6% to $12.2 billion, missing views. Analysts had projected 44 cents and $12.6 billion.HPE stock was down more than 1% in after-hours trading Wednesday, following its earnings and spinoff release. Shares rose 1.1% in the regular session in the stock market today, at 22.09.Hewlett-Packard Inc. split into two publicly traded companies last November. It formed Hewlett Packard Enterprise to focus on services and products for businesses and other enterprises, and printer/PC maker HP Inc. (HPQ). HPE in May announced plans to spin off and merge its enterprise-services division with Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC)HPE had reportedly been in talks with private equity firms over the software business before Micro Focus surfaced as the buyer.HPW will still sell networking, data storage and servers to corporate customers. Analysts say CEO Meg Whitman aims to better position the company vs. Dell Technologies, following its just-completed acquisition of EMC, as large companies shift spending to cloud computing services. Companies are spending less on their own data centers, pressuring IT suppliers like HPE and IBM.""We are taking another important step in achieving the vision of creating a faster-growing, higher-margin, stronger cash flow company well positioned for our customers and for the future,"" said CEO Meg Whitman, in a statement.IBD'S TAKE: HPE stock hit an all-time high last week amid speculation over a company breakup.

(CSC), the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) is ... what?The company that's left says it will be a more focused rival in today's enterprise ""hybrid"" cloud and on-premises computing world to Dell/EMC, IBM (IBM) and Cisco Systems (CSCO), but investors and analysts aren't quite sure what to make of things as they have quickly evolved.""The stock has performed well on an aggressive share repurchase program and the projected incoming cash and stock from the two deals, but we do not see this as sustainable without consistent results for the remaining Enterprise Group business units,"" Alex Kurtz, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities, said in a research note late Wednesday. ""Shares have outperformed on aggressive capital allocation plans, but there are no signs of demand stabilization.""Pac Crest rates HPE stock sector weight, or neutral. Needham is maintaining its buy rating, but it's not particularly tied to actual business performance.IBD'S TAKE: Big companies can make big stock moves, while avoiding much of the volatility of smaller companies. Check out the IBD Big Cap 20 for the big companies that currently are performing the best.""The company has become adept at pivoting, splitting and divesting as necessary to extract shareholder value out of a business that plus or minus a point is basically not growing,"" Needham analyst Richard Kugele wrote in a research report Thursday. ""That said, we believe the value extracted from the spin-merger of the software business with Micro Focus adds at least $2 in value for shareholders to our previous $22 price target (now $24) and on that basis warrants a reiteration of our buy rating.""UBS analyst Steven Milunovich also maintained a buy, but with a caveat. While he said in a research note that the recent deals benefit current shareholders, ""the question when the dust settles is whether HPE will win as a more agile hybrid infrastructure vendor or have difficulty competing with larger Cisco and Dell with greater software and services assets.""Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock ended Thursday trading down 3.2% to 21.38 on the stock market today. The stock hit a record high of 22.32 on Sept. 1.Late Wednesday, HPE confirmed earlier reports that it would spin off its software business and merge it with U.K.-based Micro Focus International, as one of Silicon Valley's true pioneering companies continues to restructure and focus on the rise of cloud computing.HPE will receive $2.5 billion in cash and Micro Focus stock valued at $6.3 billion at the time of the announcement. U.K.-based Micro Focus is traded on the London exchange. HPE shareholders will own 50.1% of the new company, which is expected to generate about $4.5 billion in annual revenue, more than $3 billion from the HPE side.In May, HPE announced the sale of its services business to Computer Sciences, with HPE shareholders owning about half of a company valued near $8 billion. This deal is expected to close in Q1 2017 and the Micro Focus deal in the second half of 2017.In announcing the Micro Focus deal, HPE said ""the move enables a stand-alone HPE to realize its vision of being the industry's leading provider of hybrid IT, built on the secure, next-generation, software-defined infrastructure that will run customers' data centers today, bridge them to multicloud environments tomorrow, and enable the emerging intelligent edge that will power campus, branch and IoT applications for decades to come.""It was only in November that venerable Silicon Valley stalwart Hewlett-Packard Inc. split into two publicly traded companies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise to focus on services and products for businesses and other enterprises, and HP Inc. (HPQ) to focus on PCs and printers.Also late Wednesday, HPE announced mixed results for its fiscal Q3 ended July 31. Earnings per share minus items of 49 cents topped Wall Street views for 44 cents, but revenue fell 6% year over year to $12.2 billion, where analysts had expected $12.6 billion. In constant currency, servers fell 2% and storage fell 5%, though the networking unit rose 10%.HPE CEO Meg Whitman is trying to create a company better able to compete with Dell Technologies, following its just-completed acquisition of EMC, as well Cisco and IBM, as large companies shift spending to cloud computing services.But Pac Crest's Kurtz said HPE still needs to show it can ""buck industrywide secular headwinds facing on-premise hardware vendors and if HPE can establish share as a provider in new growth categories like hyper-converged appliances.""RELATED:Cisco Systems Should Get Into The Chip BusinessHP Inc.

135,HPQ,"An acquisition of 3D Systems (DDD) is unlikely in the wake of General Electric's (GE) plans to buy two European makers of metal printing products, though Belgium-based Materialize (MTLS) could be acquired, speculates Pacific Crest Securities.Shares of 3D Systems and rival Stratasys (SSYS) closed down 1.9% and 3.5%, respectively, in afternoon trading on the stock market today. But they rose 5.6% and 3.8%, respectively, Tuesday after GE announced that it would buy acquire Sweden's Arcam and Germany's SLM Solutions Group for $1.4 billion, respectively. The two companies are leading suppliers of metal additive 3D manufacturing machines. Most 3D printer companies make parts from plastic and other materials.Weston Twigg, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, says GE's acquisitions could pressure 3D Systems, but he doesn't expect a buyer such as HP Inc. (HPQ) to surface. HP is just entering the 3D printer field.""We don't expect any near-term bid for 3D Systems, despite GE's announcement,"" Twigg said in a research report late Tuesday. ""3D Systems has an overly broad product portfolio, in our view, and larger entrants like HP and GE are looking at ways to leverage in-house expertise to improve upon current 3D printing technology rather than entering the market through a large acquisition.""IBD'S TAKE: GE aims to be a leader in the industrial internet, but its core businesses include aviation, where 3D manufacturing could play a role. GE stock hit an eight-year high in early 2016, but shares have slipped of late. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.GE expects to generate $1 billion in revenue from 3D printing activities by 2020. GE's push into 3D printing is a negative for 3D Systems, which makes metal printers, and relatively neutral for Stratasys and Proto Labs (PRLB), says Pacific Crest's Twigg. He says GE might eventually try to buy Materialise.""If GE creates a more aggressive competitive dynamic, 3D Systems will need to decide whether it should continue to invest R&D to continue to develop its platform, or whether to exit metals altogether,"" added Twigg. ""There's an outside chance that Materialise could become a GE acquisition.""RELATED:GE Buys European Printing Firms, Lifting 3D Systems, Stratasys

136,HPQ,"As rumors swirl that Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) is planning to sell off its software unit, the company is preparing to announce its fiscal third-quarter earnings after the market close Wednesday.HPE closed Friday up a fraction, at 22.21, just below its all-time high of 22.32, reached on Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: HPE ranks No. 25 out of 46 stocks in IBD's Computer-Tech Services industry group. To see which companies lead the group, check out the IBD Stock Checkup.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the enterprise information technology provider earned 44 cents a share on sales of $12.64 billion in its fiscal Q3 ended July 31. It will be the company's third quarterly report since it split from the old Hewlett-Packard Co. The other company formed in the breakup was PC and printer maker HP Inc. (HPQ).For the current quarter, Wall Street is modeling for HPE to earn 60 cents a share on sales of $13.1 billion.Late Thursday, Reuters reported that HPE is in talks with buyout firm Thoma Bravo to sell its software division for $8 billion to $10 billion. HPE CEO Meg Whitman wants to focus the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company on networking, storage, data centers and related technology services, Reuters said.On Aug. 11, HPE announced its intent to buy SGI (SGI) in a deal worth about $275 million. SGI makes high-performance computing systems for data analytics and data management.Wall Street analysts say investors are more interested in a breakup of HPE than the company's Q3 earnings report.Wells Fargo Securities analyst Maynard Um, in a research note, said he expects an in-line quarter from HPE and that the software unit divestiture will be a ""bigger focus.""Um rates HPE stock as outperform, with a valuation range of 23 to 25.Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha said it's possible HPE could sell off other businesses and be entirely broken up within two years.""We believe Meg Whitman is willing to usher in a major change to create value for stakeholders so that she may leave on a high note within 2 years of the HPE/HPI split,"" Garcha said in a research report Thursday.Garcha rates HPE stock outperform, with a price target of 25.RELATED:Hewlett Packard Enterprise Price-Target Hiked; Breakup Scenario?

137,HPQ,"Chinese competition dogs the likes of Apple (AAPL), HP (HPQ), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Intel (INTC) and many other U.S. companies -- but not so much the makers of fiber-optic components, especially at the high-end of the market.That's a good thing for optical component makers such as Acacia Communications (ACIA), Lumentum Holdings (LITE), Finisar (FNSR), Oclaro (OCLR), and NeoPhotonics (NPTN), which aim to ride a so-called ""supercycle"" that some analysts expect could last more than two to three years.Lumentum stock notched an all-time high on Thursday, while Finisar, Oclaro and NeoPhotonics all touched more than five-year highs. Acacia made its IPO in May and hit its record high on Sept. 7. The companies have helped drive IBD's 14-company Telecom-Fiber Optics industry group to No. 1 out of 197 groups tracked. The group reached a 15-year high on Sept. 7.Optics demand has surged as telecom companies like Verizon Communications (VZ) upgrade networks and internet firms such as Google and Facebook (FB) build new data centers packed with computer servers.U.S. optical parts makers and suppliers of system-level fiber-optics products, such as Ciena (CIEN), are far ahead of Chinese rivals in churning out faster communications products.IBD'S TAKE: The best stocks are often part of the best industry groups, which is why IBD ranks 197 industry groups by performance and goes deep on the weekly Industry Snapshot feature, including this one on the current No. 1 group, Telecom-Fiber Optics.U.S. companies are shipping optical transceivers and network switches that whisk data at 100 gigabits per second and are working on 400G products. At the low end of the market where Chinese suppliers operate, price competition is fierce for older, slower 10G and 40G products.""With the exception of InnoLight, which is the only Chinese company capable of doing 100G, Chinese component suppliers are mainly focused on low-cost, low-speed datacom optics today, at 10 and 40 gigabit,"" Dmitry Netis, an analyst at William Blair & Co., told IBD. ""Long-distance optics have not been an area of strength or particular know-how for Chinese component suppliers yet.""Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google invested in InnoLight in 2014. Other Chinese component suppliers include Accelink, Eoptolink, Wuhan Weiyun Technology, and Huihong Technologies. While Apple has Chinese smartphone rival Xiaomi to contend with and HP battles Lenovo in laptops, there's no rising star in China's optical components industry. Huawei, which has emerged as a global supplier of telecom networking equipment, makes some optical components internally at subsidiary Hisense, but it's a big customer of U.S. optical suppliers.Troy Jensen, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, says it's more economical for U.S. companies to invest in the R&D needed to develop leading-edge 100G and 400G parts than it would be for Huawei, which would sell components mainly to itself. A company like Finisar sells components to Cisco, Ciena, Alcatel and many customers, he says.""China is typically a product generation behind the pure-play optical guys,"" Jensen told IBD.U.S. companies usually manage to garner high profit margins for three or four years before comparable Chinese products hit the market, says Alex Henderson, an analyst at Needham & Co.China, though, has made it a priority to create a world-class semiconductor industry to reduce its reliance on foreign suppliers. China now produces about 20% of the chips it consumes in phones, appliances, TVs and other manufactured products locally, Citigroup said in a research report this month. An initiative called ""Made in China 2025"" aims to increase local chip production to as much as 70% by 2025.Already Huawei, dating back to 2013, acquired Belgium-based Caliopa to gain know-how in high-end silicon photonics.But while China's semiconductor industry has made great strides in wireless and other chip areas, the government hasn't prioritized fiber-optics technology as much.One reason could be that the semiconductor industry is much bigger than fiber optics and spans many more end-markets, says Henderson. He says some optical products use advanced materials that Chinese companies have not yet widely utilized.China's government may rethink its fiber-optics strategy, analysts say, in the wake of the U.S. Commerce Department briefly banning component sales to China smartphone maker ZTE earlier this year. The U.S. said ZTE broke export sanctions against Iran.The U.S. has since lifted its restrictions on component sales to ZTE, which is a customer of Acacia and other parts makers, but China might set it sights on ensuring a local supply of high-end optical devices in the future, says Needham's Henderson.For now, though, U.S. companies are positioned to take advantage of the current supercycle in the fiber-optics industry, analysts say, with China among their markets.The U.S. optics makers that do the most business in China are NeoPhotonics, Lumentum, Oclaro and Finisar, says Piper's Jensen. NeoPhotonics' customers include Huawei.Chinese telecom companies, just like U.S. carriers such as Verizon, are upgrading networks in metropolitan areas to 100G technology, Jensen says. Metro networks as well as data centers need more bandwidth to handle internet video, mobile broadband and business-driven data traffic.Chinese internet leaders Alibaba Holdings (BABA) and Baidu (BIDU) lag U.S. counterparts in upgrading data centers to 100G technology, but they are expected to pick up the pace over the next couple of years, says Vladimir Kozlov, CEO of LightCounting Market Research.He tells IBD that many Chinese component suppliers have focused on the residential and business broadband market, but companies like Eoptolink are making strides in 100G technology for telecom. The country, indeed, already has begun to focus optics, he says.""There are more domestic suppliers,"" Kozlov said. ""China's government has encouraged development of optics.""

Wells Fargo (WFC) is still reeling from the major cross-selling fraud scandal. General Motors (GM) said its Chevy Bolt will have a higher battery range than the Tesla Motors (TSLA) Model 3, as Tesla and others gave autonomous vehicle updates. Two huge agribusiness mergers were announced.The major averages followed the Sept. 9 sell-off with several large and up-and-down days. Fed Gov. Lael Brainard's dovish comments Monday helped reassure investors that a September rate hike was highly unlikely.

Apple said it sold out its initial production run of iPhone 7 Plus and jet-black color iPhone 7 handsets. Samsung's recall of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones because of battery fires could help Apple gain smartphone market share, analysts said.Apple rose 11.4% to 114.92, its best weekly gain in years and blasting past a 110.33 buy point on Wednesday.August retail sales fell 0.3% and industrial production sank 0.4%, both worse than expected. But struggling apparel stores, groceries and restaurants reported higher sales. September's Philly Fed manufacturing index jumped far more than expected, while the New York Fed's Empire State index remaining negative. But the most important economic news may have come Monday, when Federal Gov. Lael Brainard signaled she would prefer to be cautious with rate hikes. That reinforced expectations that the central bank will take no action at this week's policy meeting.Wells Fargo shares continued to slide over the cross-selling fraud scandal, losing nearly 7% for the week.

Both touted their international prospects.Intel expects third-quarter revenue of $15.3 billion to $15.9 billion vs. its prior range of $14.4 billion to $15.4 billion. That's a 7.8% yearly gain at the midpoint, the best since Q3 2014. The chip giant largely credited ""replenishment of PC supply chain inventory"" but also is ""seeing some signs of improving PC demand."" Intel also raised gross margin targets. Intel shares rose 3% Friday, briefly hitting its highest levels since January 2001.Oil prices were on track to fall for the week as reports indicated that production is rising faster and demand increasing at a slower pace. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries released its monthly oil report Monday that production from nonmembers will increase by 200,000 barrels a day in 2017 vs. a prior outlook of a decline or 150,000 barrels per day in its August report. On Tuesday, the International Energy Agency said in its monthly report that global crude demand will only rise by 1.3 million barrels a day this year as Q3 demand slows at a faster pace than expected. On Wednesday, the Energy Information Administration reported a surprise 559,000 barrel drop in domestic crude stockpiles. But production rose by 0.4% to 8.493 million barrels per day.

139,HPQ,"Microsoft (MSFT) stock edged up Monday after getting a bullish report from UBS.UBS analyst Brent Thill reiterated his buy rating on Microsoft and upped his price target to 64 from 62. Microsoft closed fractionally higher at 58.10 on the stock market today. It is just below its all-time high of 58.50, reached on Aug. 9.Thill said he is enthusiastic about Microsoft's cloud computing prospects, as it shifts away from its legacy Windows PC-server business.IBD'S TAKE: Microsoft's Azure has become one of the big cloud-computing players, along with Amazon Web Services and Alphabet's Google. See how these three firms crushed telecom titans Verizon and AT&T in the cloud.Microsoft's commercial cloud business (including Office 365, Azure and Dynamics) ended the June quarter on a $12.1 billion annual-revenue run rate.

155,HPQ,"3D printer maker 3D Systems (DDD) early Wednesday posted adjusted earnings per share that doubled Wall Street expectations, sending its shares soaring by nearly 18% at the close.But illustrating the ongoing struggles in the 3D printer market, the company posted its fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue declines. Q2 revenue fell 7% from the year-earlier quarter to $158 million, where analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected $161 million.The 3D printer maker, however, also reported earnings per share minus items of 12 cents, double the consensus estimate.3D Systems stock ended the day at 14.35, up 2.17 on the stock market today, moving above its 50-day line.3D Systems cited strong demand for the company's health care solutions and software, as well as higher materials orders from health care and industrial customers, though that was not enough to offset the lower demand for 3D printers overall.Rival Stratasys (SSYS) reports Q2 earnings before the market open Thursday.

158,HPQ,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) stock jumped Friday on a report that private equity firms might target the company, which has a sizable market valuation.KKR, Apollo Global Management and Carlyle Group are mulling a buyout of the enterprise technology company, according to The Information news website.Hewlett Packard Enterprise has a market cap of $36 billion. Privately-held Dell last year agreed to buy data storage company EMC.HPE declined to comment. Shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise jumped as much as 7.8% in the stock market today, before ending the day up 3.5% at 21.02.Hewlett Packard Enterprise in May announced plans to spin off its enterprise-services division and merge it with Computer Sciences Corp.

159,HPQ,"Apple (AAPL) iPhones are drubbing Samsung and other Android rivals in the Bring Your Own Device race to provide ""bulletproof security,"" says Tech Research Pro.Yet, good security often, if not usually, is lacking on employee-owned mobile devices used in the workplace, a Tech Research Pro survey found and other sources say.Of 259 respondents in a Tech Research Pro survey in April and May of decision makers in companies worldwide, 76% said their companies let employees use personal smartphones for business but only a third of IT departments support these devices, and employees aren't too security conscious.""Enterprise security breaches reported by respondents also reflected a tendency on the part of employees to take a more relaxed attitude toward security on their mobile devices,"" Tech Research Pro said in its report.The BYOD trend is important for Apple and Samsung, which see the enterprise sector as a growth opportunity amid overall slowing smartphone growth, says ZDNet and TechRepublic editor Larry Dignan. Corporate information technology units are trying to respond.Industry tracker Forrester recently found that more than half of all corporations are developing BOYD programs. Still, 1 in 3 decision makers polled by Tech Research Pro said their IT departments support only company-provided smartphones, tablets, wearables and laptops.Apple is leading Microsoft (MSFT) and Samsung in usage of tablets and wearables; it's leading Microsoft, Lenovo, Dell and  HP Inc. (HPQ) in laptops; and it beats Samsung in smartphones, according to Tech Pro Research. Apple's lead is partly on the opinion that it's more secure, Dignan told IBD.In the Tech Research Pro survey, more than half of respondents (51%) rated the iPhone as ""good or excellent in security."" Only 30% said the same for Samsung, though the company is closing the gap with its Knox mobile security app, says Tech Research Pro.The gap in actual usage is smaller -- 67% were using Apple vs. 62% using Samsung -- meaning some users could be trading lesser security for lower device costs, since Apple devices often cost more than others.BlackBerry (BBRY) also dominated Samsung in terms of security perception -- 39% rated its security as ""good or excellent."" And Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google is also pushing for the enterprise segment, Dignan says.Still, the halo effect of Apple's security pays real dividends.""From the start, Apple has had good security built in,"" Dignan told IBD. ""It doesn't have the fragmentation that Android has. It's hard to protect Android, which has different versions, flavors and eight different operating systems vs. one iOS.""Apple's security reputation stems in part on its tight control of its App Store and requirements for installing apps, says Ryan Kalember, Proofpoint (PFPT) senior vice president of cybersecurity strategy.""The iOS devices, for a very long time, were considered more or less bulletproof from a security perspective, unless they were jailbroken,"" Kalember told IBD. Jailbreaking an Apple device escalates a user's privileges, allowing third-party apps not approved by the App Store to be installed.Many security professionals consider jailbreaking an opening to a Pandora's box. Such was the case when a hacker created Ex Code Ghost, mimicking Apple's Ex Code app which developers use to create legitimate apps. The Ghost version was uploaded near the end of 2015 and allowed apps to be created, but it inserted malicious code after the fact.Apple identified the offending code, but not before it penetrated 1,100 legitimate apps in the official App Store, including the app for Chinese Uber rival Didi Chuxing Technology, a ride-hailing service.""It was cleaned up, but it was a very a clever way to puncture the illusion that, just if you had iOS only and no jailbroken devices, then you were safe from a security perspective,"" Kalember said.Soon after, Proofpoint discovered another vulnerability shadowing Apple's security illusion -- Dark Side Loader, a fraudulent app store that clones legitimate apps by stealing certificates. Dark Side Loader takes advantage of an Apple mechanism that allows companies to create and upload their own apps to a private store for employees.But Dark Side Loader uses it to peddle free versions of paid apps, allowing Apple users to circumvent the official app store. Kalember likens it to Napster for apps, which is troubling because ""Apple never reviews that app ... like Apple does for every app in the enterprise store.""Still, Apple shines in the Tech Research Pro security survey. The lion's share of respondents (82%) rated Apple's iPad security ""good or excellent,"" vs. 77% and 73% for Microsoft and Samsung, respectively. In wearables, 65% rated Apple's security highly to 58% for both Microsoft and Samsung.Also, 42% felt Apple's MacBooks have excellent security, while only a third said the same for Microsoft. Dell, HP and Lenovo trailed at 30%, 29% and 27%, respectively.The BYOD trend kicked off in earnest less than a decade ago, but it's already entrenched. Of respondents to the Tech Research Pro survey, only 2% said there is absolutely no use of personal mobile devices -- smartphones, laptops, tablets and wearables -- in their workplaces.To that end, Forrester Research found that 60% of corporate decision makers plan to invest heavily in mobile application development before year's end. CNBC reported recently that Target (TGT), Walgreens (WAG), Amazon.com (AMZN) and eBay (EBAY) are leading the pack in developing mobile apps for their employees.But employees are the weak link in security, Tech Research Pro found. Only 12% of those surveyed had experienced a breach in the past year, but of those, 57% cited a lost device and 23% lack of data encryption on the employee's device.That extended to sharing the device and/or the data with unauthorized people within and outside the company.Nearly every laptop (96%) was password-protected, along with 89% of tablets, 85% of smartphones and 57% of wearables, researchers found.But less than half of all devices required data encryption or central management. Laptops are most likely to be encrypted (47%), but only 38% of smartphones and 36% of tablets are protected similarly, says Tech Research Pro.Mobile device management (MDM), which can remotely push updates or lock down a misplaced device, was used on 48% of laptops, 47% of tablets and 44% of smartphones. Wearables trailed in every security regard. Less than a third are protected by encryption or mobile device management.Wearables are just entering the workplace, though. Of those surveyed, 94% were using smartphones and laptops, 74% were using tablets and only 14% were using wearables. BYOD wearables were most prevalent in the military, law enforcement, health care, field maintenance and sports sectors, Tech Research Pro found.Usage has a part to play on security perception. Respondents ranked laptop security highest with tablets, smartphones and wearables trailing, respectively. This likely stems from the ability to track down a lost or stolen device, researchers said, which is why desktops are considered the most secure devices.BYOD security is an overwhelmingly mobile target, Proofpoint's Kalember says. IT departments are still inking their policies, which is why only the savvier companies require higher levels of protection like MDM and mobile threat protection, he told IBD.More stringent IT departments might install MDMs that scan for rogue apps, Kalember said. The tech team can lock a user out of corporate email and/or apps until the offending app is uninstalled. But IT departments employing such tactics are early adopters, he says.""The typical thing we see for most BYOD is that the IT department has a primitive understanding of an employee blacklist, and it's to avoid employee time-wasting,"" he said. ""They might install a mobile device management tool to prohibit employees from installing 'Angry Birds' or 'Pokemon Go.' ""

161,HPQ,"Amid speculation that private equity firms are eyeing Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE), Credit Suisse raised its price target on the stock, on views that a company breakup is possible.Credit Suisse raised its price target to 25 from 21. HPE stock popped late Friday after online news site The Information reported that KKR, Apollo Global Management and Carlyle Group are eyeing the company. Reuters later reported that PE firms might be focused on HPE's software business, where revenue has been falling.After rising 3.5% on Friday, Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock ended trading Monday up 6 cents to 21.08 on the stock market today.""We believe that the stock could be worth 31 per share in a breakup scenario,"" said Kulbinder Garcha, a Credit Suisse analyst, in a research report Monday.HPE has a market cap of $34 billion. But in May, HPE said it will spin off its enterprise services division and merge it with Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC) The spinoff is expected to be completed by March 2017.Private equity firms are likely focused on the remainder of the company.

HPE would still have a networking gear business, which grew when it acquired Aruba Networks last year.At Needham & Co., analyst Richard Kugele said in a report: ""While servers, storage, software and other business lines have their challenges, it would not be out of the realm of possibility in our view for the cash flow to entice private equity to take HPE off the market. Any acquisition would likely need to be at ($28 to $30 per share) to have a chance with investors.""Hewlett-Packard Inc. split into two publicly traded companies last November, forming Hewlett Packard Enterprise, to focus on services and products for businesses and other enterprises, and HP Inc.

162,HPQ,"3D printer makers Stratasys (SSYS) and 3D Systems (DDD) were downgraded by Piper Jaffray following channel checks that revealed a ""significant slowdown"" in product demand in the second quarter.Piper Jaffray analyst Troy Jensen also expects shipments by Stratasys and 3D Systems will fall below expectations in the second half of 2016.He attributed the 3D printer slowdown partly to the entry of HP Inc. (HPQ), formerly Hewlett-Packard before its split, into the 3D printer market two months ago. HP introduced two 3D printers, with partners that include Nike (NKE), Autodesk (ADSK) and Proto Labs (PRLB).""We believe several customers have and will likely continue to pause purchasing to assess these new (HP) offerings,"" Jensen wrote. He also thinks several existing resellers of Stratasys and 3D Systems are likely to partner with HP, which will likely distract channels and stress relationships.""Our 2Q16 survey results were the poorest we have seen in recent memory, and given the internal challenges both Stratasys and 3D Systems have, we have become more cautious on both companies,"" Jensen wrote.Though Stratasys fared better than 3D Systems in the survey, ""the overall tone remained extremely negative and system demand has seemed to have hit a recent low,"" Jensen wrote about Stratasys. Jensen downgraded Stratasys to neutral from overweight and lowered to 24 from 32.Stratasys stock was down 9.1% to 21.17 at the close on the stock market today, falling below its 50-day moving average.Jensen lowered his rating on 3D Systems to underweight from neutral and his price target to 10.25 from 12. Channel checks on 3D Systems indicated ""demand was more challenging than ever.""3D Systems stock was down 8.4%, near 13.48, at the close, also dipping below its 50-day average.IBD's TAKE: Both 3D Systems and Stratasys have low ratings based on IBD's technical analysis. Stratasys has a Composite Rating of 10, putting it among the lowest 10% of all stocks in some key metrics. 3D Systems has a CR of 44.Shares of both companies were hammered in 2015 as 3D Systems and Stratasys posted quarter after quarter of disappointing earnings and sales, before nearing a bottom in January. 3D Systems hit a six-year low of 6 on Jan. 20. Stratasys hit a six-year low of 14.48 on Jan. 26.3D Systems on April 4 announced it had recruited Vyomesh Joshi as CEO.

163,HPQ,"HP Inc. (HPQ) narrowed the gap with No. 1 PC vendor Lenovo in the second quarter, research firm IDC said late Monday.HP increased its personal computer shipments by 5.1% year over year in Q2 to 12.96 million units. It increased its worldwide PC market share to 20.8% from 18.9% a year earlier. China-based Lenovo continues to lead, but its PC shipments fell 2.3% to 13.2 million units. But since Lenovo's decline was less than the overall market decline, its market share actually increased to 21.2% from 20.7%, IDC said.Total PC shipments fell 4.5% to 62.4 million units in Q2. That's better than the forecast decline of 7.4%.Dell held on to third place with 16% market share, followed by Asus (7.2%) and Apple (AAPL) (7.1%).Apple showed the biggest decline among the top five PC vendors, down 8.3% year over year.Improved inventory levels put the PC market on a better footing for the second half of the year, IDC said. Also, the expiration of free upgrades to Microsoft's (MSFT) Windows 10 at the end of the month might spur people into buying new systems, the research firm said.In the U.S., PC shipments rose 4.9% to 17.03 million units in the second quarter, IDC said. Among the top five vendors, Apple was a laggard, notching a 7.6% decline in Mac shipments. The other four top U.S. vendors posted double-digit increases in Q2.HP is the No. 1 PC vendor in the U.S., with 27.9% market share in Q2. Dell is second with 25.8% market share, followed by Lenovo (14%), Apple (11.2%) and Acer (5.2%), IDC said.Rival market research firm Gartner (IT) late Monday estimated that worldwide PC shipments fell 5.2% to 64.3 million units.

Don't dilute R&D and marketing budgets by trying to be everything to everybody, Segall advises.Instead, ""focus resources on doing things that truly stand out,"" he said. ""That brings clarity to employees and customers alike.""Segall also has found that providing too many choices can actually impede the buying process for customers. He points out while Dell and HP Inc. (HPQ) offer numerous laptop models, ""Apple offers a mere three -- yet it captures more of the profits in the PC category than Dell and HP combined. The key is providing the right choices, not endless ones.""Pare down tasks. Half of strategy is deciding what not to do, says Mark Rampolla, author of ""High-Hanging Fruit: Build Something Great by Going Where No One Else Will."" He's also the CEO and founder of ZICO Beverages.""This is more than simply prioritizing a to-do list,"" he continues. It means teaming up with the closest team members to ""define your collective values and goals for your business (and) having the courage to remind each other 'It will not be like this!' when things start to go sideways.""Streamline. Steve Jobs once said that Apple makes progress by ""removing the superfluous,"" Segall said.Scrutinize your processes, product features and website, he suggests, as you're likely to find the superfluous in them if you look critically enough for it.  Create a movement. Initiatives launched within a company are often met with muted interest or sometimes even resentment, Segall says.The way around that is simplification, he says, because ""everyone wants it, and employees will enthusiastically join the effort"" when things are presented that way.Listen to your intuition. Those who lead for simplicity refuse to be slaves to numbers, is another conclusion Segall has made.""With years of experience in business and in life, leaders trust their instincts to make key decisions,"" he said. ""Data is important, but just one factor among many.""Concentrate on now. Rampolla says it's easy of course to worry about things like quarterly reports and the next investor meeting. ""So easy, in fact, that our brains keep returning to whatever stress we've manufactured for ourselves and distract us from what we're doing in the present.""The solution, he added, is to ""truly focus on what you're doing right in the moment. Give it your full attention. When you can be present in the moment, you can take a breath and realize that despite all the hard stuff still ahead, right in this moment, everything is OK. This has a calming effect and lets you tackle, and maybe once again enjoy, the task at hand.""Keep a winning attitude. It's just as simple to do so as the opposite. Don't think of success as a distant, hoped-for payout, but as ""something we work to experience continuously,"" Rampolla said.When your daily journey of creating your business is meaningful, challenging and a personal quest, ""it becomes an endeavor where you literally cannot lose,"" he said.

175,HPQ,"Cisco Systems (CSCO) earnings growth might slow amid mounting competitive pressure from Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and a “refocused” Juniper Networks (JNPR), says Goldman Sachs, which on Wednesday downgraded Cisco to neutral from buy.Cisco stock closed down 1.1% at 28.65 in the stock market today.While Cisco already faces “significant pressure” from Nokia (which this year completed its $17 billion acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent), Arista Networks (ANET), and China-based Huawei, new threats are emerging, says a Goldman Sachs research report. “We see heightened competitive pressure from a more focused HPE following its acquisition of Aruba last year and split from HPQ,” Goldman analyst Simona Jankowski wrote in the report. “In the data center segment, we see Juniper as a more meaningful competitor.”Hewlett-Packard split into two publicly traded companies last November, Hewlett Packard Enterprises and HP Inc., which focuses on PCs and printers. HPE last month said it would spin off and merge its enterprise-services division with Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC).HPE now could be on the prowl for acquisitions, analysts say.“Cisco has been able to offset share losses in networking with share gains in servers, but we see those as largely exhausted now,” Jankowski said. “In addition, the significant increase in management turnover over the last few months raises execution risks over the medium term.”Some analysts have speculated that Cisco could buy a data storage company with software expertise in converged infrastructure.“We believe HPE now has a much more rounded networking portfolio with the Aruba asset, as well as a much stronger focus on enterprise IT infrastructure,” added Jankowski. “In addition, its leadership in servers and significant presence in storage (where Cisco only participates through partnerships rather than directly) can give it a competitive advantage in situations where the customer is looking for bundled solutions.""HPE’s significantly lower margin structure allows it to undercut Cisco on price.”

176,HPQ,"Western Digital (WDC) on Tuesday received a price-target hike to 50 from 45 and an upgrade to outperform from market perform by Cowen analyst Karl Ackerman.The moves comes two days before Western Digital is slated to give new guidance that will include its $16 billion acquisition of SanDisk. Western Digital announced the completion of its SanDisk acquisition last week, creating a big competitor in both disk drives and flash-chip storage. The company has said it would update its guidance after the market close Thursday for its fiscal fourth quarter ending July 1.Ackerman says while he expects the SanDisk acquisition to dilute earnings through 2017, “We think the stock should start to work higher from here, as Western Digital’s updated guidance should act as a positive catalyst and help eliminate uncertainty.""Western Digital stock finished trading up 4.5% to 42.28 in the stock market today. However, the stock is down 47% since the acquisition was announced in October. Shares hit a four-year low of 34.99 on May 16 but are up 20% since then.Western Digital and SanDisk had combined revenue of about $20 billion in 2015, with $14.5 billion from Western Digital. It’s the largest provider of disk drives, ahead of Seagate Technology (STX).SanDisk is a leading provider of chips used for data storage in a wide variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets and PCs. The deal will help SanDisk, which has a strong retail business, move up the ladder to make bigger sales to businesses and other enterprise customers -- the market where Western Digital is strongest. Western Digital gets the ability to offer chip-based storage in areas where its disk drive technology is losing ground.Western Digital's year-over-year revenue has fallen for six straight quarters. That’s largely due to lower disk drive sales in the slumping PC market and the migration of disk storage to chip-based storage in many products. Seagate's revenue has fallen for five straight quarters.“Now that SanDisk is subsumed into Western Digital’s operations, Western Digital now morphs from an enterprise highly exposed to the cannibalization of next-generation storage into a media agnostic, vertically integrated data storage provider capable of generating mid-single-digit revenue growth and low-double-digit EPS growth,” Ackerman wrote.He said the top 10 customers shared between Western Digital and SanDisk include Best Buy (BBY), Apple (AAPL), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and HP Inc. (HPQ)“With SanDisk, Western Digital can now more effectively service both enterprise and hyper-scale customers and capitalize on the explosion of data creation that should double every two to three years by 2020,"" Ackerman wrote.

178,HPQ,"The entry of HP (HPQ) into the 3D printer market is a disruptive force against 3D Systems (DDD) and Stratasys (SSYS), but it's not an overwhelming slam, as the two market leaders have time to react, say analysts.HP's entry is a ""negative"" for 3D Systems and Stratasys, but it's ""been expected and the real competitive impact could take years to develop,” wrote Pacific Crest Securities analyst Weston Twigg in a research note late Tuesday.The long-awaited entry of HP into the 3D printer market began Tuesday, with partners that include Nike (NKE), Autodesk (ADSK), ProtoLabs (PRLB) and Materialise (MTLS). HP said the printers are 10 times faster and half the cost of current 3D printing systems. HP is offering two 3D printers, one for prototyping and the other for prototyping and short-run manufacturing needs.HP has vast resources and a strong desire to turn 3D printing into a growth business, Twigg wrote. “The technology could be disruptive, and customers have shown a high desire to partner with HP on the development of the printer,” he said.The HP announcement is a “modest positive” for Materialise, a 3D printer maker that is partnering with HP on software and other areas, Twigg said. It’s also a modest positive for ProtoLabs, which focuses on the commercial market and offers industrial 3D printing as a service.Though not a direct competitor, Proto Labs is a close peer to 3D Systems and Stratasys and can quickly adopt HP printers if it makes economic sense, as Proto Labs is building out its additive manufacturing service bureaus.Sales of 3D printers totaled $5 billion last year, according to HP. It expects to ship and recognize 3D printing revenue by the Oct. 31 end of its fiscal 2016,  and ramp up the business in fiscal 2017. But HP does not expect 3D printing revenue to make a material revenue contribution in either year, wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani in a research note.HP’s new lineup poses a threat to 3D Systems and Stratasys in price and speed, but the threat is not overwhelming, said Piper Jaffray analyst Troy Jensen.“We do believe the aggressive pricing HP is promoting could cause pipelines to shrink over the next couple quarters as customers review HP’s printing capabilities,” Jensen wrote in a report. But select printers from 3D Systems and Stratasys “are better in certain applications,” he said.3D printing technology is being increasingly embraced by corporations, governments and universities. The market for 3D printers, including supplies, will grow 33% to $7.3 billion and will approach $10 billion in 2017, according to Wohlers Associates, which provides technical, market and strategic analysis on the 3D printer market.HP stock fell a fraction on Tuesday but was up a fraction in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 11.50. HP stock has been below its 50-day line most of this month. 3D Systems stock, up nearly 1% Tuesday, was down more than 3% Wednesday afternoon, and. Stratasys stock, up nearly 2% on Tuesday, was down 3%.

179,HPQ,"The long-awaited entry of HP Inc. (HPQ) into the 3D printer market began Tuesday, with partners that include Nike (NKE), Autodesk (ADSK), ProtoLabs (PRLB) and BMW.The new printer line, called HP Jet Fusion 3D Printing Solution, “revolutionizes design, prototyping and manufacturing, and for the first time, delivers superior quality physical parts up to 10 times faster and at half the cost of current 3D print systems,” HP said in its press release.HP will compete with 3D Systems (DDD) and Stratasys (SSYS), the two largest providers of 3D printers, among others.HP is offering two 3D printers. They are the HP Jet Fusion 3D 3200 printer, designed for prototyping, and the Jet Fusion 3D 4200 printer, designed for prototyping and short-run manufacturing needs. Pricing on the 4200 model starts at $155,000 and will be delivered in late 2016. Pricing on the 3200 model starts at $130,000, with deliveries in 2017, HP said.Besides Autodesk, software partners include  Materialise (MTLS) and Siemens. Besides Nike, BMW and Proto Labs, co-development partners and strategic partners also include Jabil  Circuit (JBL), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Shapeways.HP stock fell in the stock market today, to 11.53. HP stock has been below its 50-day line most of this month. 3D Systems stock, though, rose nearly 1% Tuesday, and Stratasys stock rose nearly 2%.

180,HPQ,"The surprise move by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to spin off and merge its enterprise-services division with Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC) could put pressure on IBM (IBM) to respond, analysts say.Shares in Hewlett Packard Enterprise rose 6.7% to 17.34 on the stock market today after HPE late Tuesday announced the tax-free spinoff of its services business. HPE also reported better-than-expected fiscal Q2 earnings, but EPS was still down 2% year over year.“We believe the HPE Services plus CSC transaction will cause Xerox (XRX) services to be looked at as an acquisition target, as well as put pressure on IBM to consider making acquisitions in its services business,” Citigroup analyst Jim Suva said in a report.The combination of HPE’s enterprise services business and Computer Sciences will have about $26 billion in annual sales. The deal is expected to close in March 2017.Jason Kupferberg, analyst at Jefferies, says the HPE-CSC deal has merit.“We believe the combined firm will trail only IBM Global Services and Accenture (ACN) in terms of global IT Services revenue,” Kupferberg said in a report. “While neither CSC or HPE enterprise services are industry growth leaders and have been in turnaround mode, we see strategic rationale for the merger, given the complementary vertical exposures (CSC strong in insurance, health care and banking, with HPE enterprise services known for pharmaceuticals, transportation, and telecom.)”Hewlett-Packard split into two publicly traded companies last November, with HP Inc. (HPQ) due to report late Wednesday. Shareholders of HP Enterprise and CSC will each own half of the new company's shares.Computer Sciences stock shot up 42.2% to 50.68. Xerox shares rose 2.6% and IBM 2.2%, while Accenture fell 0.5%.Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry said the HPE services-CSC merger is the combination of two struggling companies and could result in 65,000 layoffs.""Two bad assets does not make one good asset,"" he said.

181,HPQ,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) jumped after hours following the spinoff of HP (HPQ) announced its own spinoff, while Sportsman's Warehouse (SPWH) sank amid weaker guidance. Meanwhile, Bayer (BAYRY) signaled optimism that it could reach a deal with Monsanto (MON), which earlier Tuesday rejected a $62 billion offer.Shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, the provider of servers and other IT services that was spun off from HP last year, surged 10% in late trading after the company announced its own tax-free spinoff and merger of its Enterprise Services business with Computer Sciences (CSC). The move would establish a $26 billion global IT firm, HPE said.Computer Sciences shares leapt nearly 20% after hours.The merger, expected to close by March 31, comes amid concerns about weakening IT spending.""The spin-off and merger is the logical next step in the turnaround of HPE's Enterprise Services segment,"" Hewlett Packard Enterprise said in a statement.The company's full-year EPS guidance of $1.85-$1.95 was above consensus for $1.88. Its second quarter revenue rose 1% to $12.7 billion, beating estimates for $12.3 billion. EPS of 42 cents matched expectations.Bayer said it's confident that it can meet Monsanto's conditions for a deal. It released a statement following Monsanto's rejection of its unsolicited offer, in which the U.S. agribusiness giant did leave the door open to a takeover at a higher price.""We are pleased that Monsanto's Board shares our belief in the substantial benefits an integrated strategy could provide to growers and broader society,"" said Werner Baumann, Bayer CEO. ""We are confident that we can address any potential financing or regulatory matters related to the transaction. Bayer remains committed to working together to complete this mutually compelling transaction.""Monsanto stock rose 3% to 112.55 in after-hours action, following a regular-session rise of 3.1% to 109.30.Outdoor sporting-goods retailer Sportsman's Warehouse cut its full-year sales guidance to $770 million-$790 million from an earlier forecast of $800 million-$820 million.The company also reported a break-even first quarter, just above expectations for a 1-cent per-share loss. Sales rose 9.0% to $151.6 million, missing, views for $158.98 million.The company cited ""the continued strength in firearms"" as driving its Q1 results, which came despite ""continued weather headwinds which impacted performance in our apparel areas."" Uncommonly warm weather in recent months has hurt many retailers' sales.Shares fell 3% late. Firearms maker Smith & Wesson (SWHC) and Sturm Ruger (RGR) were unchanged late.
"
182,HPQ,"3D printer maker Stratasys (SSYS) is set to report earnings before the open Monday, after archrival 3D Systems’ (DDD) report on Thursday showed continuing struggles for the sector.The consensus is that Stratasys will post Q1 revenue of $164.8 million, down 4.5% year over year and the third quarter in a row of declines.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect a 4-cent per-share loss minus items, swinging from a 4-cent profit in Q1 2015, and marking the sixth quarter in a row of earnings deceleration.The Q1 earnings by 3D Systems showed a 5% drop in revenue to $152.5 million, nearly $4 million short of views. It was the company's fourth straight quarter of revenue deceleration. The company posted flat EPS ex items of 5 cents.Shares of 3D Systems and Stratasys were hammered in 2015, as both posted quarter after quarter of disappointing earnings and sales. Stratasys stock hit a six-year low of 14.88 three months ago and is up nearly 40% since then despite a six-day losing streak. Stratasys stock closed Friday at 21.06, down 1%.3D Systems has doubled since hitting a five-year low of 6 three months ago, but the stock has also fallen for that last six trading days. 3D Systems fell 3.1% Friday, to 13.16.But despite the struggles of the two market leaders, the 3D printing industry is stronger than it seems, say industry analysts who track the field. Global 3D printer revenue rose 34% last year to $3.3 billion and shipments rose 68% to 133,000 units, according to estimates from research firm Canalys.And globally, 3D printing technology is being increasingly embraced by corporations, governments and universities.But the 3D printer companies await a new, potentially major, rival, as HP Inc. (HPQ) plans to enter the market this year.

184,HPQ,"3D Systems (DDD) missed with its Q1 revenue posted early Thursday, its third straight quarter of year-over-year declines in sales, as the 3D printer market resets expectations.Before the open, 3D Systems reported Q1 revenue of $152.5 million, down 5% year over year and missing the consensus of $156.3 million. Excluding the contribution of consumer products and services that the company no longer sells, revenue fell 2%.The company posted flat earnings per share minus items of 5 cents.3D Systems stock was down nearly 6%, near 14, in afternoon trading in the stock market today, and it touched a seven-week low.Vyomesh Joshi, named CEO last month, sees big market opportunities ahead.“I’ve spent the past month listening to and learning from customers, partners and employees,” commented Joshi said. “I will be focusing on improving quality, reliability and supply chain. The next phase for us is to develop a strategy to drive profitable growth with operational excellence and an appropriate cost structure.”Joshi had been executive vice president of the imaging and printing business of HP Inc. (HPQ), formerly part of Hewlett-Packard before its split. HP plans to enter the 3D printer market this year.In the company's earnings conference call, 3D Systems CFO David Styka said demand for professional 3D printers remained soft last quarter. Revenue from professional printers excluding desktop decreased 23%, on a 50% decline in unit sales.“The decrease in units was partially due to the availability gaps for new MultiJet Printers rolled out during the first quarter,” he said.CEO Joshi, on the call, repeated several times he was in a learning mode, but optimistic ahead.“The other important part that I am learning and that's the vertical approach where we want to go after health care, aerospace, automobile, and also higher education,” he said, “because, if you think about the universities, we need to get a lot of people trained in understanding the 3D market.”3D Systems did not give earnings guidance.It and and Stratasys (SSYS) are the two largest providers of 3D printers. Stratasys is set to report earnings before the market open Monday. Its shares were down nearly 3% Thursday afternoon.3D printer makers ExOne (XONE) and Voxeljet (VJET) are set to report earnings on May 11 and May 13, respectively, both before the market open.Needham analyst James Ricchiuti last week lowered his rating on 3D Systems to hold from buy, “as shares might be pricing in too much,” he wrote.“Notwithstanding solid sequential improvement in Q4 from the publicly traded 3D printing companies, we believe business remains challenging, compounded by the normal seasonal weakness experienced in the March quarter,” Ricchiuti wrote.
"
185,HPQ,"3D Systems (DDD) is set to report first-quarter earnings Thursday, followed by rival Stratasys (SSYS) next Monday, likely providing a clearer indication of whether the runup in both stocks this year -- or the more recent downturn -- is justified.The consensus on 3D Systems is for revenue of $156.3 million, down 3% year over year, and earnings per share minus items of 5 cents, flat, as polled by Thomson Reuters.Shares of 3D Systems and Stratasys were hammered in 2015, as both posted quarter after quarter of disappointing earnings and sales. Stratasys stock, however, has nearly doubled since hitting a six-year low of 14.88 three months ago, and 3D Systems has more than doubled since hitting a five-year low of 6 three months ago.Both stocks, though, have faded in the past week. And 3D Systems shares were below 15, down 6%, in afternoon trading in the stock market today. Stratasys stock was down more than 4% Wednesday afternoon, below 22.The rise of both stocks most of this year was partly fueled by Q4 earnings from both companies that beat expectations, raising hopes the top-two 3D printer makers are poised for a rebound. But 3D Systems and Stratasys executives took a cautious tone about the road ahead.3D Systems got a bounce when it announced Vyomesh Joshi as CEO on April 4. Joshi had been executive vice president of the imaging and printing business of HP Inc. (HPQ), formerly part of Hewlett-Packard before its split. HP plans to enter the 3D printer market this year.Needham analyst James Ricchiuti last week lowered his rating on 3D Systems to hold from buy, “as shares might be pricing in too much,” he wrote.“Notwithstanding solid sequential improvement in Q4 from the publicly traded 3D printing companies, we believe business remains challenging, compounded by the normal seasonal weakness experienced in the March quarter,” Ricchiuti wrote.3D printer makers ExOne (XONE) and Voxeljet (VJET) are set to report earnings on May 11 and May 13, respectively, both before the market open.

186,HPQ,"With a strong leap in the stock prices of 3D Systems (DDD) and Stratasys (SSYS), some analysts question if the rise was too far too fast.Needham analyst James Ricchiuti on Tuesday lowered his rating on 3D Systems to hold from buy, saying further upside in the stock over the near term will be challenging. He says the turnaround at 3D Systems should be more gradual than the market is anticipating.It follows a recent downgrade of 3D Systems and Stratasys from Citi based on stock price valuations of both companies.Shares of 3D Systems and Stratasys were hammered in 2015 as both posted quarter after quarter of disappointing earnings and sales. This year, Stratasys stock has nearly doubled since hitting a six-year low of 14.88 three months ago. 3D Systems has nearly triple since hitting a five-year low of 6 three months ago.“3D Systems shares are now above our 12-month target price,” Ricchiuti wrote in a research note. “With the stock trading at 32 times our 2017 EPS estimate, the market appears to be pricing healthy upside to estimates.”The rise of both stocks were partly fueled by the Q4 earnings reports of both companies that beat expectations, suggesting the worst might be over and raising hopes the top two 3D printer makers are poised for a rebound. But that wasn’t the message that 3D Systems and Stratasys tried to signal, as comments from company executives during the conference call were of a cautious tone about the road ahead.3D Systems got a further bounce when it announced Vyomesh Joshi as CEO on April 4. Joshi had been executive vice president of the imaging and printing business of HP Inc. (HPQ), formerly Hewlett-Packard before its split. HP plans to enter the 3D printer market this year.3D Systems stock was near 18, down 2%, in afternoon trading in the stock market today.

187,HPQ,"Take your eye off iconic copier maker Xerox (XRX) for too long -- heck, Xerox stock had done little more than fall since December 2014 -- and you would have missed its run-up to Tuesday's eight-month high at 11.39, up 34% since touching a nearly three-year low in January at 8.48. Xerox stock closed Friday at 11.16, flat for the session.Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha doesn't see much upside potential, giving Xerox a 12-month price target of 11 and a neutral rating in a research note issued Friday. He does see more first-quarter earnings in Xerox, modeling 1 cent more adjusted EPS than Wall Street's 23-cent consensus, which would be up 10% from the year-earlier quarter. Xerox is scheduled to release Q1 earnings before Monday's open.But Garcha sees slightly smaller sales than the $4.24 billion consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. That Q1 consensus would be a 5.1% decline from 2015's Q1 sales and Xerox's 17th consecutive quarter of shrinking year-on-year revenue, albeit slower shrinkage than the 8% decline in Q4 and 10% contraction in Q3.The rise in Xerox stock may be tied to anticipation over its imminent split into two companies: the legacy copier/printer/office machine business and the business-process outsourcing (BPO) spinoff.Based on $18 billion in 2015 sales, down 8% from 2014, the business-machine side would wind up with about $11 billion a year in sales, and the outsourcing spinoff about $7 billion, Xerox CEO Ursula Burns said when she announced the split on Jan. 29, concurrent with the Q4 earnings release. Inspired by activist investor Carl Icahn, Burns said the breakup would unlock value in both companies. Icahn would get three seats on the new BPO board, while Xerox would get six.BPO sales, grouped currently as services under Xerox, is a ""show me story,"" Credit Suisse's Garcha said.""Management is trying to transition the business away from low-margin to more value-added business,"" he wrote in a research note. ""However, we think management has to show consistent improvement and deliver on results to regain investor confidence.""Garcha anticipates a Q1 decline of 5.4% to $2.4 billion in services revenue.As for the so-called ""document technology"" core hardware, software and document management businesses, Garcha estimates that about $1.6 billion of Xerox's annual cost of goods sold are ""yen-denominated,"" coming from the Fuji Xerox joint venture (75% owned by Fujifilm (FUJIY)). With the yen up about 9% year to date, foreign exchange ""will impact margins,"" but less than was earlier expected, Garcha said.For Q1, Garcha forecasts document tech segment revenue fell 12% to $1.6 billion.Not all of Xerox outsourcing will be part of the BPO spinoff. Document outsourcing, which fell 2% to $852 million in Q4 revenue, will stay with the larger portion of the split, a Xerox spokesman told IBD.Effective April 1, Xerox borrowed $1 billion unsecured from a consortium of seven banks to be repaid within a year or upon execution of the spinoff, whichever comes first. Xerox says the spinoff should be complete before year-end.With a market cap of $11.3 billion, Xerox is the fourth-largest member of IBD's Computer-Hardware/Peripherals industry group, following Canon (CAJ), the newly reorganized HP Inc. (HPQ), and Fujifilm.Xerox carries a middling 66 IBD Compositing Rating. Its formidable BPO rivals, Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) and Infosys (INFY) rate better, with CRs of 75 and 80, respectively.

188,HPQ,"It’s ""highly unlikely"" HP Inc. (HPQ) will acquire 3D Systems, says Citigroup, which downgraded both 3D Systems (DDD) and its rival Stratasys (SSYS) on valuation after their stocks jumped on Thursday.HP plans to enter the 3D printer market this year.3D System stock  lost 6.2%  in the stock market today, after rising 10% on Thursday. Stratasys stock tumbled 13.2%, easily negating a 5.9% rise on Thursday. Another 3D printer maker, ExOne (XONE), fell 8.45% Friday. HP lost 0.2%.IBD’s Take: How do shares of 3D Systems and Stratasys measure up? IBD Stock CheckupCitigroup analyst Kenneth Wong downgraded 3D Systems to sell and downgraded Stratasys to neutral.“(3D System) shares have nearly tripled since troughing mid-February and have doubled year-to-date, despite (3D printer) market conditions that remain unsettled. We believe the upside scenarios from operational efficiencies upside to take-out potential are overstated,” said Wong in a research note.3D Systems on April 4 named Vyomesh Joshi as its CEO. Joshi had been executive vice president of the imaging and printing business of HP, formerly Hewlett-Packard before its split last year.“We expect Joshi to bring a fresh set of eyes to DDD’s strategic growth and profit initiatives,” Wong said. “Investors believe Joshi’s HP roots enhance the possibility of an HP acquisition of DDD. While we see how bullish investors might connect the dots here, (we) believe that an acquisition by HP is highly unlikely.”Bank of America Merrill Lynch upgraded 3D Systems on Thursday to buy on views that Joshi will spark a rebound at the company.Stratasys' stock run-up also raises valuation issues, said the Citigroup analyst.“We don’t believe ‘good enough results’ will be sufficient with the recent boost in sentiment, and with industry checks still soft, we believe near-term upside is limited,” said Wong. “Our conversations with those in the industry suggest unit volumes have held, but there has been a downshift in buying towards smaller lower priced systems.""Contrary to investor expectations, we still believe that under 'normal' operating conditions, SSYS can generate double digit margins.”

189,HPQ,"Highly rated small cap Super Micro Computer (SMCI) lowered its third-quarter estimates after the close Thursday and then watched its stock crash Friday.Super Micro stock plunged 20% in the stock market today, to 26.79. The stock had made a breakout at 33.89 from a cup-with-handle base, but that breakout has now failed.Scheduled to announce Q3 earnings after the close April 28, Super Micro founder and CEO Charles Liang said late Thursday in a preannouncement that the quarter ended March 31 turned out ""weaker than forecast due to weaker demand with some large customers and the channel than we anticipated. January and February were particularly soft, while March showed improved momentum. Storage and data center continued to grow.""Except for the reference to March, there was ""little detail on going-forward expectations,"" Needham analyst Richard Kugele said in a Thursday research note. ""We see great risk to the company's goal of 20%-plus annual revenue growth and expect the stock will return to the penalty box, at least until further clarity is provided on the April 28 call.""IBD's Take: Super Micro had been hot, but a breakout failed. How does the stock stack up? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupKugele, though, said he still likes the company in the long term and that it's outpacing the broader server/storage market. He reiterated his buy rating and 36 price target on Super Micro.Super Micro said Q3 revenue will come in at $530 million to $533 million instead of $530 million to $580 million. It now sees non-GAAP EPS of 33 cents to 35 cents vs. earlier guidance of 43 cents to 53 cents. Wall Street consensus had been 49 cents minus items, up 4% from the year-earlier quarter, and sales of $557 million, up 18%, Kugele said. Thomson Reuters on Friday cited consensus of six analysts on non-GAAP EPS of 46 cents and of seven analysts on revenue of $552 million.The preannouncement offered no guidance. Thomson Reuters put consensus on the current fiscal Q4 EPS minus items at 66 cents on revenue of $650 million vs. 57 cents on $574 million a year earlier.With an IBD Composite Rating of 98, Super Micro Computer had ranked as the best among all members of IBD's Computer-Hardware/Peripherals industry group. But its CR has now fallen all the way to 81. It's also one of the smallest, with a market cap of $1.35 billion. The largest, Canon (CAJ), with a $32.6 billion market cap, carries a 34 CR, followed by newly reorganized HP Inc. (HPQ), with a $21.8 billion market value and a 46 CR.Canon stock was down a fraction intradayFriday, while HP stock was up a fraction.Image provided by Shutterstock.

190,HPQ,"3D Systems (DDD) received a much-needed vote of confidence from an analyst report Thursday, sending shares of it and Stratasys (SSYS) rising on hopes the top two 3D printer makers are poised for a rebound.Shares of both companies were hammered in 2015 as 3D Systems and Stratasys posted quarter after quarter of disappointing earnings and sales. In November, 3D systems announced that Avi Reichental had resigned as CEO and president after 12 years of leading the 3D printer pioneer. The company ran with an interim CEO until April 4, when 3D Systems announced it had recruited Vyomesh Joshi as CEO. Joshi had been executive vice president of the imaging and printing business of HP Inc. (HPQ) -- formerly Hewlett-Packard before its split. HP plans to enter the 3D printer market this year.Optimism about Joshi's hiring anchored the positive report from Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Wamsi Mohan on Thursday. Mohan upgraded 3D Systems stock to buy from underperform and raised his price target to 26 from 11.3D Systems stock rose 10% Thursday to 18.28, hitting its highest price since June. The stock had touched a more than five-year low of 6 in January.Stratasys rose 5.9% to 29.35 and hit its highest point since October. In February, it touched a more than six-year low of 14.48.Smaller 3D priner makers Voxeljet (VJET) and ExOne (XONE) rose 8.6% and 7.6%, respectively, with ExOne achieving a nearly one-year high, and Voxeljet missing a five-month high by a penny.Merrill Lynch did not distribute the research report to the media, but according to a summary of the report from 24/7 Wall Street, Mohan wrote: “Our buy rating on 3D Systems is predicated on the strong likelihood that the new CEO will turn around the business through a new direction and strategy based on his experience as an executive of HP’s established printing business.”Mohan expects Joshi can boost earnings by improving operational efficiency and refocusing investments, “even while end-market demand remains subdued.”3D Systems and Stratasys struggled last year. 3D Systems reported 2% revenue growth in 2015, to $666 million. At Stratasys, revenue fell 7% to $696 million. Revenue for both companies, year over year, declined in each of the last two quarters of the year, ending a long string of double-digit gains for the pair.Terry Wohlers, president of Wohlers Associates, which provides technical, market and strategic analysis on the 3D printer market, says Joshi earned a strong reputation from his work at HP.“People have a high regard for his leadership,” Wohlers told IBD. “He can take 3D Systems to the next level.""Despite a challenging year, revenue from 3D printers, supplies and services overall rose 26% in 2015, to $5.16 billion, according to Wohlers Report 2016, the latest edition of an annual publication dedicated to 3D printing. This year, Wohlers forecasts the market will grow 29% to $6.7 billion, and that it will rise 31% to $8.8 billion next year.Still, Merrill Lynch aside, most analysts continue to take a cautious tone on 3D Systems and Stratasys, even after both reported better-than-expected Q4 earnings. Observers in general are not convinced of a full-scale rebound, even as 3D printing technology is increasingly embraced by corporations, governments and universities. And it's not just observers who are wary. Executive of both 3D Systems and Stratasys have used a cautious tone when talking about 2016.Wohlers is not among the cautious crew, at least when looking down the road a bit.“If you view the industry through the lens of investors and share price, you will have a distorted view of what’s happening in the 3D printer market,” he said. The long-term future of the technology, he says, is strong.“Some of the biggest corporations and brands in the world are making significant investments in 3D printing,"" Wohlers said. ""We see a tremendous amount of activity that is advancing the industry.”The 3D-printer believers include Nike (NKE) and General Electric (GE). Nike has said 3D printing has revolutionized the way it designs and manufactures footwear. GE has made big investments in 3D printing, which it calls additive manufacturing. GE used 3D printers to develop complex fuel nozzles for its next-generation jet engine, known as Leading Edge Aviation Propulsion, in a partnership with France-based Snecma.Lockheed Martin (LMT), Airbus (EADSY), NASA and United Technologies (UTX) are also becoming bigger users of 3D technology.While the boom in 3D printing is good news for Stratasys and 3D Systems, it has also attracted more competitors. In 2015, 62 manufacturers sold 3D industrial machines, up from 49 in 2014, says Wohlers.HP's entry is expected to ripple through the industry. UBS analyst Steven Milunovich, in a March 31 research note, partly pointed to HP when he rated Stratasys as a sell, with a price target of 19.“The stocks of Stratasys and 3D Systems have jumped on a sequential Q4 revenue increase and outlook for slightly up revenue in 2016. However, we are becoming more concerned about HP's entry later this year,” which could have a negative impact on the two industry leaders, he wrote.Troy Jensen, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, said in a research report on April 11 that he recently met with HP executives.“We believe HP is in the late stages of alpha trials and is planning a controlled launch within the next few months with a limited number of partners,” he wrote.HP has said its printers will be faster, more efficient and cost less than products currently on the market.Many 3D printer companies are based in Europe. Besides Germany's Voxeljet, they include EOS Manufacturing Solutions, a fellow German firm and one of the largest 3D printer companies, with a wide range of 3D printers. Others are Germany-based SLM Solutions, Belgium’s Materialise and Sweden-based Arcam.

243,HPQ,"OpenStack could soon be the software that runs the non-Amazon cloud.Open-source software available for free, OpenStack helps corporate IT departments manage data centers packed with computer servers.OpenStack has also gained popularity as a tool to connect data centers to public clouds, where computing resources are shared via the Internet.But Amazon.com's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services (AWS) is by far the biggest provider of infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). And it uses its own software, not OpenStack.Still, OpenStack has gained popularity among enterprises that want to use multiple cloud platforms.For investors, the question is: which companies will gain the most from OpenStack's rise as a cloud operating system?""There's a big roster of household name IT vendors that are backing OpenStack — Intel (INTC), IBM (IBM), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Dell and HP (HPQ) — a lot of companies have placed a bet,"" said Al Sadowski, an analyst at 451 Research.Worries over whether OpenStack could handle large business workloads have eased. So OpenStack seems primed for wide adoption, though there are open-source rivals such as Citrix Systems' (CTXS) CloudStack, points out James Staten, a Forrester Research analyst.""The concerns now are less about the platform itself and who is influencing its development,"" Staten told IBD. ""The concerns instead are about who takes OpenStack successfully to market and begins to lead through market power. That's a key theme worth watching in 2015.""Rackspace, NASA DevelopedRackspace Hosting (RAX) and government space agency NASA co-developed OpenStack in 2010, aiming to make the software a cloud computing standard. Rackspace's main business has been hosting websites. Rackspace stepped up investments in OpenStack in 2012 and 2013, but its revenue growth slowed as companies lingered in testing OpenStack's capabilities.Rackspace now supports multiple cloud platforms and has become less dependent on OpenStack near term.""While Rackspace continues to develop solutions on the OpenStack platform, management is providing managed cloud solutions across multiple technologies,"" wrote James Breen, a William Blair analyst, in a research report last month.The OpenStack ecosystem is growing, says 451 Research. The market research firm says that OpenStack-related revenue will rise to $3.49 billion in 2018 from $890 million in 2014.""All OpenStack needs to do is get to the same reliability and resiliency as the computing platforms it's replacing,"" Sadowski said. ""It's clear, though, that OpenStack is gaining mindshare and marketing power.""Early backers hoped that OpenStack would slow the march of AWS. Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan estimates that AWS revenue will jump 40% to roughly $5 billion in 2015. Even so, ""OpenStack is starting to mature as enterprises shift legacy IT workloads to cloud environments,"" Horan said.Expedia (EXPE), Walt Disney (DIS), Time Warner Cable (TWC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and BMW are among recent OpenStack adopters, says 451 Research. Earlier users included eBay's (EBAY) PayPal, Best Buy (BBY) and Fidelity Investments.To attract corporate customers, OpenStack supporters positioned the open-source software as an alternative to VMware 's (VMW) software, widely used in data centers to make servers more efficient.Red Hat (RHT), the leading provider of Linux open-source server software and a VMware rival, has lined up behind OpenStack.But pushing its own cloud platform is still VMware's top priority, analysts say. With partners such as the privately held Mirantis, VMware sells software that helps its customers use OpenStack for building so-called ""private"" cloud data centers that are accessible by branch offices, clients and others.Analysts say that most enterprises are interested in a public-private hybrid cloud model — running the most important business apps on their own servers behind a private corporate firewall and accessing public IaaS providers as needed.Many tech vendors are focused on providing tools for hybrid clouds. Rackspace aims to provide managed services in the hybrid cloud market rather than struggle vs. much bigger IaaS firms AWS, Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOGL).Positioned As Cloud Concierge""Rackspace continues to remain technology agnostic even as the company's OpenStack is increasingly attractive as a platform for public cloud,"" said Barclays analyst Sandeep Gupta in a report. ""As AWS, Microsoft and Google continue to put pressure on pricing, we wouldn't be surprised if Rackspace positions itself as a cloud concierge to a hybrid cloud environment.""Many tech suppliers aim to use OpenStack to bridge private and public clouds.""The strong leaders in OpenStack today are a mix. Hewlett-Packard and Red Hat are clearly strong voices in the community, as is SuSE, Mirantis, Internap (INAP) and arguably Cisco Systems due to their recent moves,"" said Forrester's Staten. ""Rackspace still has a strong voice, IBM to a lesser degree, as they are really only focusing on it for their private cloud initiatives.""IBM last year acquired cloud-service firm SoftLayer for $2 billion. HP has said that it'll spend $1 billion over the next two years on products and services around OpenStack.451 Research says that Europe-based OVH and startup Blue Box have gained traction with OpenStack customers. Some companies are using acquisitions to gain a foothold in cloud computing services and OpenStack. EMC (EMC), another cloud company, acquired Cloudscaling in October, Cisco bought Metacloud in September and Red Hat purchased eNovance in June.Lydia Leong, an analyst with research firm Gartner, agrees that OpenStack has gained momentum. The OpenStack Foundation, with more than 430 members, has regularly rolled out improved versions of the software.""OpenStack is gaining more traction than it had before as the product starts to become more useable,"" Leong told IBD. ""The primary beneficiaries are those that sell (software) distributions, such as Red Hat, HP and Mirantis.""

It has not been big in firewalls.The so-called perimeter firewall market — the main type of firewall — is about $7 billion a year, says research firm Infonetics. But it's a crowded field, with Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Juniper Networks (JNPR) among the suppliers of firewall security products.Seattle-based F5 Networks says that it's sticking with a focus on data center security as opposed to firewalls, despite speculation otherwise.""The perimeter is going away,"" F5 CEO John McAdam said at the company's annual investor meeting last month. ""The cloud is going to change everything. We think being in the data center and understanding applications is a major advantage.""Cloud computing enables companies to share business resources with customers and suppliers via the Internet.Protects Against DDoS AttacksF5 in May acquired Defense.Net, a provider of cloud-based security services that help protect websites from large-scale distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that make servers unavailable to users. In 2013, F5 Networks bought Israel-based Versafe. Its software protects Web applications from malware, fraud and phishing attacks.F5's security-related acquisitions go back to 2004 and likely are not done, analysts say. But F5 Networks has a checkered track record overall with acquisitions. One that never panned out as expected was its 2007 purchase of network storage vendor Acopia Networks.""Their M&A strategy appears to be focused on (smaller) tuck-ins, though there is always a possibility of a larger deal,"" said UBS analyst Amitabh Passi.At F5 Networks' investor day, McAdam said, ""We don't have a budget as such for M&A. We have a lot of cash, and we'll use the cash if we think we can basically get technology that's probably on our road map. ... Two areas that we've been more focused on than anything are security, No. 1, and service provider (telecom companies), No. 2.""In its fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, F5's revenue rose 17% to $1.73 billion. In the current fiscal year, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters model sales growth of 13% followed by 12% growth in fiscal 2016.McAdam called security ""probably our biggest growth driver for the next five years.""Some analysts are cautious.""While opportunities for F5 in security are encouraging, we think they are already discounted into consensus expectations and reflected in the current evaluation,"" Frederick Grieb, an analyst at Nomura Securities, wrote in a research report.F5's stock has shot up more than 45% in 2014.Jayson Noland, an analyst at R.W. Baird, said in a research report that F5 is making its name in security. ""Our channel discussions are generally positive on F5's security offerings,"" he wrote, ""though the company is not typically considered a primary security supplier.""F5's ADCs cost $50,000 to $300,000, depending on how many servers and how much traffic they handle. F5 competes with Citrix Systems (CTXS), which has a security-related pact with Palo Alto Networks, as well as Radware (RDWR) and A10 Networks (ATEN) .F5 Networks also sells software-based ADCs, or virtual ADCs, that run on low-end servers in data centers rather than on its own hardware. F5 has expanded into data center security by selling software modules from Versafe and Defense.Net that run on its ADCs.""F5 seems to be making a push toward more license/subscription revenue with both its core ADC platforms and security,"" said Barclays analyst Ben Reitzes in a research note.Brent Bracelin, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, this month raised his price target on F5 stock to 163 from 153, ""to factor in the company's opportunity to continue expanding its security business in fiscal 2015. Overall, security software that is bundled with ADC appliances has increased to 36% of revenue from 30% last year.""In ADC security, F5 competes with Imperva (IMPV) and Verizon Communications (VZ), which sells a cloud-based Web application firewall.Imperva could be a more formidable rival if it's acquired by the likes of Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), EMC (EMC) or Oracle (ORCL), speculates Jonathan Ho, analyst at William Blair.""Imperva and F5 are the leaders in data-center web-application firewalls today,"" Ho told IBD in an email. ""The WAF secures Web servers and is a completely different product than a perimeter firewall.""He says software modules that provide threat detection capability put F5 Networks in competition with Juniper and Fortinet (FTNT), more so than Check Point and Palo Alto Networks.""While F5 is a newer player, I see them as having distribution advantages since they have a broad (sales) channel, large installed base and established credibility,"" Ho said. ""As a smaller company, Imperva has a sole focus on security and a narrower set of products.""

(HPQ) into the 3D printer market is seen as creating problems for 3D Systems (DDD) and Stratasys (SSYS), causing an analyst to issue a warning about the two market leaders.While 3D Systems and Stratasys are the two largest providers of 3D printers, HP (formerly Hewlett-Packard before its split) will gain market share over time, wrote UBS analyst Steven Milunovich in a research note. He reiterated a sell rating on Stratasys with a price target of 19. UBS also has a sell rating on 3D Systems and a price target of 9.Stratasys stock was up almost 3%, near 26, during afternoon trading in the stock market today. 3D Systems was near 15, down a fraction.The stocks of 3D Systems and Stratasys, having collapsed over the past two years due to numerous problems, are up sharply since recently hitting bottom. Despite the improvement and expectations of a turnaround, Milunovich believes that HP will be a disruptor. He says that HP expects to formally announce its first product in a few months, with availability by year end.“We expect HP to discuss betas with large industrial companies and provide impressive performance metrics,” Milunovich wrote. He also said, “(HP) indicates little interest in acquiring either Stratasys or 3D Systems, which surprises us.""He believes that HP could gain broader technology, patents, channels and, with 3D Systems, metals capability, via an acquisition of one or the other.HP has also said that it plans to avoid the consumer market, where 3D Systems and Stratasys have flailed.3D printer revenue, including supplies, is expected to top $7 billion this year and approach $10 billion by 2017. Despite the struggles of 3D Systems and Stratasys, the 3D printing industry is stronger than it seems, say industry analysts who track the field. Among companies with big investments in 3D technology are Nike (NKE) and General Electric (GE). Nike has used 3D printers to develop several sport shoes, while General Electric uses them to produce advanced jet-engine fuel nozzles.

308,HPQ,"Apple will revamp its iPhone lineup in 2017, according to a new note by Ming-Chi Kuo at KGI Securities, according to various reports.The 2017 smartphone will have a curved glass body, similar to the iPhone 4/4s ""flat sandwich"" design, Kuo said, AppleInsider reported.  But instead of flat glass it will likely have curved glass front and back. The 5.8"" iPhone -- presumably the iPhone 8 -- will use AMOLED displays. While there have been widespread rumors that Apple would turn to OLED displays, Kuo had previously predicted that they wouldn't be used until after 2017.Organic light emitting diode displays are thinner and more power-efficient than liquid crystal displays. They also have higher color saturation and are more flexible than LCDs. Samsung, Motorola, LG, the Alphabet (GOOGL) Google Nexus and the upcoming HP Inc. (HPQ) HP Elite x3.The 2017 iPhone also will use some form of wireless charging, 9To5 Mac said, citing Kuo's note. It will also have some new biometric features, possibly facial or eye recognition.The 5.8-inch phone could replace the current 5.5"" size entirely if there is sufficient OLED supply, Kuo said. If not, it could be a new high-end model on top of the 5.5"" design. Apple also will have a 4.7-inch model in either case.The iPhone 7 due out later this year may not be radically different from the iPhone 6/6s, aside from being thinner and having no headphone port.

309,HPQ,"HP Inc. (HPQ) stock tumbled on Thursday, a day after the PC and printer maker reported in-line sales and earnings for its fiscal first quarter but signaled more challenges ahead.Shares were down more than 4%, near 10.30, in midday trading on the stock market today.At least four Wall Street analysts cut their price targets on HP stock after the company posted results.In response to continued sluggish PC and printer sales, HP management decided to accelerate its corporate restructuring actions. The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company expects to cut 3,000 jobs this year instead of over a three-year period as originally planned.""We believe that management is taking the necessary steps to right-size its expenses and develop new products to drive profitable share gains,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Sherri Scribner said in a research report. She maintained her buy rating on HP stock but cut her price target to 13 from 16.BMO Capital Markets analyst Thanos Moschopoulos reiterated his market perform rating on HP stock but cut his price target to 12 from 13. ""We believe the tough road ahead will persist as PC and printer markets continue to shrink,"" he said in a report.For its fiscal Q1 ended Jan. 31, HP earned 36 cents a share excluding items on sales of $12.2 billion, in line with forecasts. On a year-over-year basis, EPS and sales each dropped 12%. On a constant currency basis, factoring out foreign-exchange impact, sales slid 5%.For the current quarter, HP expects non-GAAP earnings per share of 35 to 40 cents. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had been modeling 39 cents, on sales of $11.9 billion. HP did not give a Q2 sales forecast.HP also reiterated its fiscal 2016 EPS guidance of $1.59 to $1.69 on a non-GAAP basis. Analysts had been targeting $1.60.Sterne Agee CRT analyst Rob Cihra said HP could have a tough time making its full-year EPS target unless it buys back more stock than planned. He rates HP as neutral, with a price target of 11.The PC market is a cyclical business at best and is in secular decline at worst, Cihra said. Meanwhile, the company's cash-cow printing business is facing declining sales in both hardware and ink supplies. New printing ventures like commercial A3 copiers/printers and 3D printers are unlikely ""to move the needle anytime soon,"" Cihra said.PCs accounted for 62% of HP's revenue in Q1, and printing brought in the remaining 38%. Printing accounted for 77% of operating profit, with PCs contributing 23% of the total.Personal computer revenue fell 13% year over year in Q1, while printing revenue dropped 17%. On a constant currency basis, PC revenue fell 6%, and printer revenue tumbled 11%. Printing supplies revenue dropped 14%, or down 8% in constant currency.""Fundamentals in the PC and printing industries continue to erode,"" Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brent Bracelin said in a report. ""The pace of erosion in the printing segment, which represents 77% of profits, (is) problematic relative to expectations for profits to rebound in the second half. Until printing stabilizes, HPQ shares could remain at depressed levels.""“We operate in mature markets,” HP CEO Dion Weisler said on a conference call with analysts. “This is an environment where we know how to win, gain share and out-execute our competitors.”

310,HPQ,"Personal computer and printer maker HP Inc. (HPQ) late Wednesday delivered in-line sales and earnings for its fiscal first quarter of 2016, but the midpoint of its EPS guidance for fiscal Q2 was below Wall Street's target.HP stock rose a fraction in after-hours trading following the earnings news release.

On a year-over-year basis, EPS and sales each dropped 12%. On a constant currency basis, factoring out foreign exchange impact, sales slid 5%.For the current quarter, HP expects non-GAAP earnings per share of 35 to 40 cents, or 37.5 cents at the midpoint. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had been modeling for HP to earn 39 cents a share ex items on sales of $11.94 billion in its fiscal second quarter. HP did not give a Q2 sales forecast.HP also reiterated its fiscal 2016 EPS guidance of $1.59 to $1.69 on a non-GAAP basis. Analysts have been targeting $1.60 EPS for the full year.PC and printer sales are mired in a prolonged slump.

Lenovo is No. 1 with 21.4% market share, IDC says.“We have a clear strategy that leverages our strengths, and we are focused on execution, taking cost out of the business and delivering innovations that will amaze our customers and partners,” HP CEO Dion Weisler said in a statement. “Although we have some tough quarters ahead, I am confident in the future.”

313,HPQ,"ServiceNow continues to epitomize high growth in a technology company.The enterprise software firm late Wednesday reported third-quarter sales and earnings that beat analyst estimates as it expands beyond its core IT service management software into such areas as human resources, financial management, and sales and marketing departments.ServiceNow's (NOW) Q3 billings number far exceeded views, and its revenue forecast for the current quarter was ahead of estimates.ServiceNow stock rose nearly 2% in after-hours trading Wednesday after ending the regular session at 58.07, down 4%.ServiceNow is one of fastest-growing enterprise software vendors, with software that manages information requests among multiple departments and users of various devices.A growing number of customers are choosing the company's software, delivered through the Internet cloud, as an alternative to older licensed software products sold by BMC Software, Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) and CA Technologies (CA).The company's ability to move beyond its IT management core is a key factor, says Steven Ashley, an analyst for Robert W. Baird.""It's absolutely critical to the story, and we expect it to continue to be,"" Ashley told IBD. ""We have talked with a number of their larger customers during this quarter, and all of them see opportunities to use the product outside of the IT department.""ServiceNow is clearly meeting demands that its larger rivals are not, says Michael Turits, an analyst for Raymond James & Associates.""There is a very large so-called white space in enterprise where ServiceNow can be used to solve this broad array of workflow problems that haven't had a single solution before,"" Turits said. ""And enterprises we talk to are really happy to solve those problems with ServiceNow.""For Q3, ServiceNow reported earnings per share minus items of 3 cents vs. 1 cent in the year-earlier period.Revenue climbed 61% to $178.7 million.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected EPS ex items of a penny on sales of $174.4 million.ServiceNow also reported billings of $200 million, up 58%.

337,HPQ,"The question of whether Red Hat is still a high-growth company remains unanswered even after last month, when it posted fiscal Q2 revenue that rose 19% from the year-earlier quarter — its biggest rise in more than two years.Nevertheless, Red Hat's (RHT) Q3 revenue guidance was lighter than expected, with the company citing foreign currency exchange issues.The No. 1 maker of software and services for the open-source Linux operating system is amid a transition. Red Hat has capitalized on companies switching from the older Unix OS to Linux, but many analysts say that the migration is slowing. In the meantime, the company has expanded into middleware, software storage and virtualization.Red Hat has also jumped into cloud services, forging partnerships with Cisco Systems (CSCO), Dell, IBM (IBM) and others to build products tied to OpenStack.OpenStack is an open-source cloud software platform with broad industry backing. The software helps companies move operations onto the Internet cloud.The writing is on the wall for the Unix-to-Linux migration, says Michael Turits, an analyst for Raymond James & Associates.""Red Hat is one of these companies that had one big leg of industry growth from a core product like Linux, but that growth is maturing,"" Turits told IBD. ""To re-accelerate, the company will need additional growth from a combination of new products.""New Markets CrucialJ. Derrick Wood, an analyst for the Susquehanna Financial Group, agrees that Red Hat's future depends on moving into other areas.""They are not a mid-20% (quarterly revenue) grower anymore, but they are still a 15% to 20% grower,"" Wood said. ""That reflects moderation in the Unix-to-Linux ramp-up and other opportunities — whether it's OpenStack or storage or a lot of their middleware products — getting more traction.""But it's far from certain that the Unix-to-Linux migration is slowing, Red Hat CEO Jim Whitehurst told IBD.""It's really hard to know because when we do deals with larger companies — even ones that are using Unix — they are not saying this is Unix-to-Linux,"" he said. ""They are just buying more units, and some of those are Unix-to-Linux, and some are (Microsoft) Windows-to-Linux, and a lot of them are just pure net new workloads.""We rarely have a deal that is just Unix-to-Linux.""Red Hat posted $339.5 million in infrastructure subscription revenue — basically, its Linux business but also a few other revenue sources — for its Q2 ending Aug. 31, up 16% from the year-earlier quarter. But subscription revenue for its middleware and application-related emerging products rose 44%, to $57.5 million.The emerging app-related revenue would be $232 million on an annualized basis, showing that the company is far from stagnant, Whitehurst says.""I don't think there is any other open-source company even half that size in such subscription revenue,"" Whitehurst said, ""so it's a large and rapidly growing business for us.""Red Hat's move into OpenStack will be most crucial in accelerating growth, Turits says.""If you combine (OpenStack) with a broad portfolio of other things they are doing, including JBoss (middleware) applications and virtualization, then it's a very attractive portfolio,"" he said.Red Hat faces competition from Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), VMware (VMW) and several privately held companies in the still-young OpenStack market.Differentiation will be the key to growth, Turits says.""They have to face the early stage of fragmentation in the industry where lots of people are offering OpenStack, and they have to figure out how they will bring that to market,"" he said.Red Hat is counting on partnerships with Cisco, Dell, Alcatel-Lucent (ALU), Nokia (NOK) and others to gain market share in OpenStack.Pairing with hardware companies, particularly with No. 1 network gear maker Cisco, should give Red Hat an edge, Whitehurst says.""Cisco is a big company with a massive go-to-market organization, which we think can help us scale our offerings by rolling out through their distribution channel,"" he said.OpenStack looks like it will be a large opportunity for Red Hat, Whitehurst says, but he adds that investors shouldn't view OpenStack as a needed replacement for a perceived slowing of the Unix-to-Linux migration.""I think people get lost in this whole 'Red Hat is slowing down, OpenStack needs to work' thing,"" he said.

339,HPQ,"This week marked an important anniversary: The current bull market is now seven years old. That's many, many moons of watching stock indexes march higher and pocketing sizable returns on your hard-earned investments.Caution returned to the market in 2015, as the S&P 500 started to trade sideways. Stocks are taking a bit of a breather this year too. Perhaps you're in need of one too.So take a moment to catch up on ETF winners of the current bull market. As the table below shows, they span a host of asset classes, from financials and preferred stocks to retail and midcaps.The very top performer out of 1,646 nonleveraged ETFs is -- are you ready for this? -- Guggenheim S&P 500 Pure Value (RPV), an ETF that targets the cheapest third of the S&P 500 index.A bull market brings to mind higher beta positions, with a stronger growth skew. Yet in the past seven years, the market has rewarded value-oriented characteristics slightly more so than growth, said Guggenheim managing director William Belden. That's helped RPV outperform.Value ETFs are generally considered to perform well over longer periods of time. ""Their greatest appeal is when the markets have gone both ways,"" Belden said.A closer look at RPV may be timely, as the market seems to have arrived at an inflection point for value stocks.RPV produced an average annual 30% return from March 10, 2009, to March 9, 2016. By comparison, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) gained an annualized 19% over the same period.SPY was also outpaced by Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight (RSP), with an annual average return of 22.4%.For investors seeking to make a style-focused bet on the markets, six Guggenheim ETFs offer style purity. They invest in only those stocks in the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600 with the strongest value and growth characteristics.Traditional cap-weighted growth or value indexes generally have some overlap between growth and value stocks.Guggenheim's ""Pure Style ETFs"" avoid the muddle in the middle, as Belden likes to say. They also weight stocks by the strength of their growth or value characteristics.With $693.9 million in assets, RPV holds a mere 111 stocks from the S&P 500. They're selected based on metrics such as price-to-book, price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios.Top holdings now include electricity supplier NRG Energy (NRG), tech business HP Inc. (HPQ) and seeds processor Archer Daniels Midland (ADM).Morningstar analyst Alex Bryan cautions that this is a risky ETF investing strategy.""The S&P 500 Pure Value Index was about 47% more volatile than the market-cap-weighted S&P 500 Value Index, which tracks the cheaper half of the S&P 500, during the past decade,"" he wrote in October 2015. ""It has also tended to underperform during market downturns.""Belden points out RPV has rewarded investors willing to take on a little higher volatility.""It has a good risk-adjusted profile,"" he said. The expense ratio is 0.35%.Most investors tend to combine RPV with an S&P 500 ETF such as SPY to overweight value stocks. But RPV can also be combined with its sibling Guggenheim S&P 500 Pure Growth (RPG) for broad and well-diversified exposure to large-cap stocks.Growth investing and value investing are generally seen as being in favor in alternating periods. But the ""Pure Growth"" and ""Pure Value"" strategies have the potential to outperform at the same time, according to Guggenheim.""The combination of both might be an attractive core position as opposed to one that's more tactically oriented,"" Belden said.It's worth noting that all six Guggenheim's ""Pure Style"" ETFs ranked in the 100 top-performing nonleveraged ETFs in this current bull market.Image at top provided by Shutterstock.

341,HPQ,"While investors applauded Hewlett Packard Enterprise's first quarterly performance as an independent company -- beating Wall Street estimates and driving its stock up more than 13% Friday -- some analysts and owners are pushing CEO Meg Whitman to compete harder.That means more aggressively taking on cloud enterprise leaders Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), and buying up software  rivals such as Workday (WDAY) or Salesforce.com (CRM), rather than directing cash to shareholders.""I think we need to give Meg a chance to see if she can take advantage of the opportunities in servers with the cloud migration led by Amazon Web Services, Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Microsoft on the service and software side,"" said Daniel Morgan, vice president of Synovus Trust, which holds 251,971 shares of HPE, in a Friday interview with IBD.""Further, the 54% year-over-year growth in the Q1 2016 quarter in networking allows HPE to build more momentum in this space"" vs. rivals Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Juniper Networks (JNPR), he said.""And finally as we discussed before, the huge opportunity to expand the software unit with its 17%-plus operating margins (enables) a large acquisition in the cloud space. Right now software is just 8%-10% of total HPE revenues.""Buying enterprise software rivals Salesforce or Workday specifically is ""a chance to make that unit significant by bringing it up to 20%-25% of revenues,"" he said. ""Post-split, Hewlett Packard Enterprise was supposed to be the growth portion of the Hewlett-Packard Co., (creating) a reinvigorated growth company.""Nevertheless, happy with HPE's earnings performance issued after Thursday's market close, investors bid up its stock up 13.5% to close at 15.44 in the stock market today. That's less than 3% below its Dec. 1 high since splitting from its parent Nov. 1.For now, HPE stockholders interested in growth of any kind will need patience because the company is still shrinking, despite the slight Q1 beat.Hewlett Packard Enterprise reported earnings of 41 cents per share in the fiscal Q1 ended Jan. 31, on sales down 3% to $12.72 billion vs. pro forma figures from a year earlier. The results slightly beat the average view of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, which called for EPS of 40 cents on sales of $12.68 billion. The non-GAAP 41 cents EPS is down from 47 cents a year earlier. (However, if HPE had been a standalone company at the time, Q1 2015 adjusted EPS would have been 44 cents, the company said in a March 1 note.)That's pretty much as planned, with HPE not projecting much growth until fiscal 2018. For Q2 ending in April, HPE expects EPS ex items of 39 cents to 43 cents.  Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Q2 EPS ex items of 42 cents on sales of $12.297 billion before Thursday's earnings release, but on Friday, the revenue consensus was revised up to $12.332 billion.For the entire fiscal 2016 ending Oct. 31,  analysts  polled by Thomson Reuters projected $1.87 EPS ex items for fiscal 2016 ending Oct. 31, on revenue revised up Friday to $50.805 billion. HPE earlier had modeled $50.81 billion in revenue in fiscal 2016, down 2.5% from a $52.12 billion pro forma in fiscal 2015.The slightly smaller half of the old Hewlett-Packard Co., now called HP Inc. (HPQ), kept the legacy PCs, printers and ticker. HP Inc. lifted 0.6% to 11.18 Friday. Hewlett Packard Enterprise kept the enterprise software, servers, networking and financial services businesses.To encourage patience among Hewlett Packard Enterprise shareholders, CFO Tim Stonesifer said HPE will “return at least 100% of our free cash flow outlook to shareholders” in fiscal 2016, after devoting $1.3 billion to share repurchases and dividends in Q1. In ""addition,"" Stonesifer said, shareholders will receive a ""majority"" of proceeds from the sale of a 51% stake in its Chinese server and storage business to Tsinghua Holdings, valued at $2.3 billion at the time the deal was announced last May. The transaction was supposed to be done by February, but Whitman said regulatory delays have pushed back closing to May, after which the cash will flow to shareholders.To UBS analyst Steve Milunovich, who complained in the post-earnings-release conference call that HPE shares were priced too low, Whitman chuckled: “We appreciate that, which is why we’re backing up the truck” to buy back more shares, which helps boost the price.Whitman advised analysts that by investing internally and encouraging organic growth “you don’t end up with a Frankenstein of architecture"" as the company would risk doing by  growing through acquisitions. She cited HPE for pursuing both paths.“Our innovation engine is firing on all cylinders, and you're going to see some amazing new introductions in the coming quarters in key areas of the portfolio, including servers, cloud, high-performance computing, IoT (Internet of Things), all-flash storage, Aruba and converged systems.” Aruba Networks is a networking leader in mobile enterprise that the old Hewlett-Packard agreed to buy last March for about $3 billion, strengthening the new HPE's rivalry with Cisco Systems and Juniper Networks.As for ""taking advantage of the disruption in the marketplace,"" Whitman said, ""we learned a lot about how to do this in the context of IBM's (IBM) sale of their server business to Lenovo. ... We have a big opportunity to go take (merging) Dell and EMC (EMC) business, much as we took a lot of the Lenovo business that would have gone to Lenovo.”She told CNBC on Friday that ""in the last quarter, we had about 107 deals that we actually took from Dell/EMC.""She also told analysts that HPE has become the ""leading infrastructure provider for SAP (SAP) HANA (application server) with nearly twice the number of shipments over the next competitor.”In the cloud, she said, ""following a major wave of product releases across our HPE Helion portfolio in the second half of 2015, we are seeing strong customer traction. In fact, since separation, Helion has gained over 200 customer wins, including some of the world's largest banks, service providers and industrials.”It just wasn't enough for Needham analyst Richard Kugele, who chided the company in a research note issued Friday, arguing that the $2.3 billion windfall from Tsinghua should be spent on organic or M&A growth, not shareholders' short-term benefit.""We had hoped that post-split, HPE would be able to focus on getting its house in order and leverage its cash and balance sheet to buy/invest in solutions that solve their product gaps,"" Kugele said. ""Instead, the company seems intent on continuing financial engineering by doubling its cash return to shareholders (including the pending Tsinghua cash). In our view, this creates no sustainable value for the company or its investors but merely provides a floor for the stock during a period of poor enterprise spending.""With no material growth, revenue improvement or product strategy to build a buy thesis around, we reiterate our hold rating on the stock.""Said Morgan, the Synovus Trust portfolio manager who wants to give Whitman time to execute: ""I did hear HPE management touting its share repurchases and FCF (free cash-flow) generation capability on the call. And this is very reminiscent of when Mark Hurd was leading HPQ  (the former Hewlett-Packard Co.) and grew the share price through financial engineering and not new product growth.""Hurd is now co-CEO of Oracle (ORCL), one of HPE's toughest software rivals, and another legacy giant growing slowly. 
"
342,HPQ,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) stock rocketed 15% in morning trading on the stock market today. Late Thursday HPE edged above earnings-per-share expectations for its fiscal Q1 ended Jan. 31, met on revenue and roughly met views with its Q2 earnings guidance, while also promising to return more capital to shareholders.For Q1, the company posted EPS ex items of 41 cents, down 6.8% from pro forma earnings of 44 cents a share in the year-earlier quarter. Sales fell 3% to $12.7 billion. For Q2, HPE expects EPS ex items of 39 cents to 43 cents. It didn't give revenue guidance.""All in all, the headline news looks like a solid report from a top/bottom-line perspective,"" Daniel Morgan, a vice president of HPE shareholder Synovus Trust, told IBD via email.On Wednesday, the company filed with the SEC to change its pro forma figures for the year-earlier quarter, which it issued after its Nov. 1 split from the legacy Silicon Valley pioneer Hewlett-Packard Co.HPE contains the business software and services, servers, storage and cloud-migration operations of the old company, with the new HP Inc. (HPQ) taking the PC and printer business. HPE now has more freedom to battle broad-based business-technology providers such as IBM (IBM), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Oracle (ORCL).HPE changed its year-earlier figure for EPS minus items to 44 cents, from 48 cents. It didn't change its pro forma revenue figure.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected adjusted EPS of 40 cents for fiscal Q1, though it's unclear if that consensus estimate would have changed with the new pro forma figure. Analysts expected revenue of $12.68 billion.For Q2, analysts had modeled EPS ex items of 42 cents on sales of $12.3 billion.The company's fiscal 2016 EPS ex items guidance of $1.85 to $1.95 met the views of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. And HPE maintained its fiscal 2016 guidance on free cash flow -- cash from operations minus capital expenditures -- of $2 billion to $2.2 billion.HPE shares fell 2.2% to 13.60 Thursday. The stock, which debuted in early November, peaked Dec. 1 at 15.88.Looking for ways to speed growth and improve shareholder value, the Hewlett-Packard split came in the face of faster-growing competition from upstarts leading the way to cloud computing.Last week, HP Inc. said its Q1 EPS and sales each fell 12%, to 36 cents and $12.2 billion.""During our first quarter as an independent company, we saw the progress that comes from being more focused and nimble,"" HPE CEO Meg Whitman said in the company's earnings release. Whitman also serves as chair of HP Inc. and had been CEO and chairwoman of the former Hewlett-Packard Co. before engineering the split-up.“We delivered a third consecutive quarter of year-over-year constant-current revenue growth, and excluding the impact of recent M&A activity, we saw revenue growth in constant currency across every business segment for the first time since 2010,” she said.Revenue rose 4% year over year in constant currency, the company said.HPE CFO Tim Stonesifer said in the earnings release that the company will “return at least 100% of our free cash flow outlook to shareholders” in fiscal 2016, after devoting $1.3 billion to share repurchases and dividends in Q1.The networking business was the clear winner last quarter, and in fact the only business that notched revenue growth. The company said its Enterprise Group overall rose 1% to $7.1 billion in revenue, with a 13.4% operating margin. Networking sales jumped 54% from the year-earlier quarter -- more than 60% in constant currency -- but storage revenue fell 3%, and tech services tumbled 9%.Also slipping were server sales, albeit by just 1%. Before the release, shareholder Morgan, of Synovus Trust, told IBD he was “looking for stabilization in areas of weakness (by) expecting strength in servers into next year, as cloud and Big Data growth spur purchases. Servers represents 48% of the Enterprise (Group) segment's revenue and was (up) 5% year-to-year last quarter.”HPE's separate Enterprise Services segment sales fell 6% to $4.7 billion, the company said. Infrastructure tech outsourcing sales fell 8%, while application and business services revenue slipped 3%.Software services fell 10% to $780 million. License revenue fell 6%, support fell 13%, professional services revenue contracted 7%, and software as a service (Saas) sales fell 9%.Financial services, which help customers pay for their purchases, fell 3% to $776 million.In its filing with the SEC on Wednesday, the company said the main differences with its new pro forma EPS number for the year-earlier quarter ""are related to cash acquired and debt incurred by HPE just prior to the distribution (of new shares to old shareholders). The primary differences between the previously provided figures and adjusted cash flow from operations and adjusted free cash flow are related to prepaids, deposits and liabilities associated with property, plant and equipment, pension obligations and income tax asset and liabilities that transferred to HPE from its former parent just prior to the distribution.""
"
343,HPQ,"One day before Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) is slated to post fiscal Q1 earnings, the stock of half of the old computing pioneer Hewlett-Packard Co. rose 4.7% in the stock market today. The stock was doing what analysts expect it to do, outperforming the other half of the legacy company,  HP Inc. (HPQ), whose shares fell a fraction.The stocks, of course, reflect the market's interpretation of the companies' operational performance since splitting into two from the legacy corporation in November.  HP, which reported earnings last week, kept the PC and printer businesses -- and the old HPQ ticker. Hewlett Packard Enterprise kept the server, storage, networking, enterprise-software and cloud-migration businesses, seen as faster-growing endeavors, and kept the CEO, Meg Whitman (who in addition is chairwoman of HP Inc).Hardware and equipment-product sales comprise about 38% of Hewlett Packard Enterprise revenue, with services generating the rest.For the quarter ended Jan . 31, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect HPE to report earnings down 17% to 40 cents per share on revenue down 2.7% to $12.68 billion, vs. a pro forma 48 cents on $13.03 billion in the 2015 Q1. The company reports after the market close.HP Inc.'s Q1 EPS and sales each fell 12%, to 36 cents and $12.2 billion.For its first fiscal year ending in October, Hewlett Packard Enterprise expects EPS minus items of $1.85-$1.95, up from the $1.84 pro forma earned in 2015, on revenue of $50.81 billion, down 2.5% from the pro forma $52.12 billion of 2015. Analysts have modeled $1.87 and $50.73 billion.""We like HPE because decent execution should be sufficient to move the stock higher,"" said UBS analyst Steven Milunovich in a February research note.  ""We believe growth in servers, networking and storage, stabilization in high-margin technology services and continued improvement in the Enterprise Services margin should help close the gap between the current P/E of 7x and our target of 10x.""Storage head Manish Goel, as well as a few of our industry sources, say that HPE is taking business from Dell/EMC (EMC) during their proposed merge.  Still, we think it's time for Meg Whitman to provide a vision for the company. IBM (IBM) has cognitive computing.  What does hardware-heavy HPE want to be in 3-5 years and what will be its differentiation?""Nomura doesn't cover HPE, analyst James Chen advised IBD Wednesday, but he and colleague Jeffrey Kvaal are watching closely as HPE competes with companies that Nomura does cover, such as Cisco Systems (CSCO), Juniper Networks (JNPR) and Arista Networks (ANET).Nomura said it expects 3% sales growth for HPE's enterprise group this fiscal year, compared with Cisco and Juniper's guidance ranges of 3% to 6%.Hewlett Packard Enterprise's ""projected growth rates are not likely to threaten networking incumbents, but don’t imply much share loss either,"" the Nomura analysts said in a research note.HPE's hybrid cloud business competes with IBM, Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure, Amazon (AMZN) Web Services and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Cloud Platform services.Big Data startup Hortonworks (HDP), the Hadoop developer, on Tuesday said it would collaborate with HPE on the use of Apache Spark, making use of shared memory in HPE enterprise environments.UBS analyst Mulinovich, in his February note, said that ""upon the split we argued in favor of HPE over HPQ stock. . . .  Hewlett Packard Enterprise has momentum with expected slight revenue growth in constant currency and an improving operating margin in fiscal 2016.""Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock is 12.5% off its Dec. 1 record high of 15.88, while HP Inc. is 26.5% off its record high of 14.82, set Nov. 24.
"
344,HPQ,"Stocks quickly turned slender gains to losses Thursday, navigating mixed influences from overseas markets, early economic data and a raft of quarterly results.The Nasdaq slipped 0.3%. The S&P 500 and the Dow struggled with fractional losses. Volume was unusually soft on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE, suggesting large-scale investors were standing back from early trade.Today's stock market set out with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 recovering to narrow gains so far this week. The market's young uptrend is seeing some affirmative data points and has thus far managed to avoid distribution days -- days in which selling by institutional investors sends the market lower in rising volume. But a positive finish to the week would help bolster investor confidence.Europe's markets hung on to their early advances in afternoon trade, with the CAC-40 in Paris and London's FTSE 100 up more than 2% apiece.But a European rally and a positive surprise in January durable goods orders weren't enough to buck up investor confidence, as weekly jobless claims rose slightly more than expected, and the bulk of early earnings reports offered at least some disappointing news.The December Housing Price Index from the Federal Housing Finance Agency fit that same pattern, rising 0.4% -- good but below November's 0.5% increase and just missing consensus views for another 0.5% gain.Still, the Dow opened with two-thirds of its stocks positive. Nike (NKE) rose 1.5% to lead the index. Chevron (CVX) posted the widest loss, down 1.5%.Salesforce.com (CRM) topped the S&P 500 with a 10% advance. The cloud-based software leader posted Q4 results late Wednesday, with strong guidance drawing similarly strong support from investors. The advance stopped at the stock's 50-day moving average, which could present some resistance as shares attempt to climb the right side of a 37%-deep consolidation.Quanta Services (PWR) muscled 6% higher on above-forecast fourth-quarter results. HP Inc. (HPQ) dropped 7% following disappointing Q4 results.Among IBD 50 stocks, theater real estate investment trust EPR Properties (EPR) pared gains and was up more than 2% after an initial 5% surge. After Wednesday's close, the Kansas City, Mo.-based firm reported better-than-expected funds from operations, but a 7% revenue gain was just shy of estimates, and management lowered its guidance on full-year funds from operations. The move left shares in frustrated stasis, just below a 62.66 buy point.

345,HPQ,"AT&T (T) will likely be the biggest user of OpenStack cloud computing software worldwide, says a Goldman Sachs report on growth in private clouds.“AT&T will likely become the largest OpenStack environment in the world, as they expect to build out their private cloud to 500,000 nodes (servers) and span across hundreds of data centers,” said Heather Bellini, a Goldman Sachs analyst, in a research report.AT&T and Verizon Communications (VZ) in January joined Facebook’s (FB) Open Compute Project, which helps companies design and build low-cost data centers with open-source software.Behind VMware (VMW) and Microsoft (MSFT), OpenStack is the third-most-popular software technology for private clouds  --  data centers that operate behind a corporate security firewall.OpenStack helps corporate IT departments manage data centers packed with computer servers. Rackspace Hosting (RAX) and government space agency NASA co-developed OpenStack in 2010, aiming to make the software a cloud computing standard.Many companies now back OpenStack, including Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Red Hat (RHT), Intel (INTC), IBM (IBM), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Dell.AT&T plans to transform its massive network by 2020 -- with software running on standard computing gear replacing specialized hardware.“AT&T hopes to run every call through its OpenStack infrastructure by 2020,” said the Goldman Sachs report. “The company believes it can take out  billions of dollars in capital spending and operating expenses from moving to private cloud as they can use commodity pizza boxes instead of proprietary Cisco boxes. The entire infrastructure will be automated, helping AT&T operate at a faster pace and bring in new services, which is easier to do when they are software-based.”AT&T is using OpenStack software provided by startup Mirantis, says Goldman Sachs. It says Verizon is also a Mirantis customer. Privately held Mirantis, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., says its investors include the venture capital arms of Intel, Ericsson (ERIC), Dell and Goldman Sachs (GS).Goldman Sachs says Red Hat and VMware are the leading providers of OpenStack software for private clouds.Image provided by Shutterstock.

346,HPQ,"Jason Weiner is like Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers.
"
347,HPQ,"Season after season, he keeps performing at a high level.
"
348,HPQ,"Since Feb. 2, 2007, when Weiner became the signal caller for the now $1.3 billion Fidelity Growth Discovery Fund and its adviser-sold twin $2.8 billion Advisor Equity Growth Fund , Growth Discovery has notched an 8.48% average annual gain vs. 7.03% for the S&P 500. Its performance ranks in the top 30% of its large-cap growth peers, tracked by Morningstar Inc.
"
349,HPQ,"Weiner has used the same approach for most if not all of his tenure, he says. He seeks undervalued growth stories and stocks with potential for price-earnings expansion, avoiding overly costly names.
"
350,HPQ,"Weiner, 45 years old, talked with IBD from his office in Boston about how he invests.
"
351,HPQ,"IBD: Jason, if you ever had a mentor, who was it?
"
352,HPQ,"Weiner: I've had tons of mentors. On the rare occasions when (Fidelity) rolls me out to meet MBAs visiting Fidelity, I tell them they should find a mentor, either outside their workplace or inside, or preferably both.
"
353,HPQ,"It's super important, going back to when I was 15 and had my first job. I got it from a family friend, Lou, who was a great influence. It was Lou Nargiso, and he owned a gas station-auto repair shop. He was a World War II vet, and he learned auto repair in the army.
"
354,HPQ,"He was a very well-educated person and philosophical. He liked to debate things. Everyone who worked for Lou was very loyal to him, as was he to them. His shop was also kind of a clubhouse for his World War II vet buddies, and I hung out with them. Good times!
"
355,HPQ,"IBD: And at Fidelity?
"
356,HPQ,"Weiner: At Fidelity, Will Danoff (manager of Fidelity's $111.1 billion Contrafund , $28.9 billion Advisor New Insights , $6.4 billion Series Opportunistic Insights and $884.8 million Advisor Series Opportunistic Insights has been a great mentor.
"
357,HPQ,"I don't remember exactly when it kicked off. It might have been around 1993. We were both on a train. Will was going to southern Connecticut, visiting his parents. We sat next to each other. I worked for him later. I gained a lot of wisdom. Will is super focused on studying each decade, understanding monster stocks in each decade, and being in the elephant-hunting business — hunting stocks that go on to make monster gains.
"
358,HPQ,"If you owned Dell in 1990, for the next 10 years nothing else mattered. It's the beauty of incredible growth stories. Will was focused on that, and I have adopted that strategy.
"
359,HPQ,"IBD: Overall, you look for undervalued growth stories and stocks with potential for price-earnings expansion, right?
"
360,HPQ,"Weiner: You only get paid for two things with growth stocks. First, for P-E expansion. Second, for underlying earnings growth of the companies you invest in.
"
361,HPQ,"Typically, I focus on the growth rate of companies. That's where fundamental research can bring value. And I try to leverage Fidelity's research engine a lot.
"
362,HPQ,"It's a little harder to predict P-E.
"
363,HPQ,"IBD: And you try to avoid valuations that are too high, correct?
"
364,HPQ,"Weiner: If you can enter a name you like when there's controversy or doubt that casts its P-E lower, that's a great opportunity.
"
365,HPQ,"IBD: Give me an example, please.
"
366,HPQ,"Weiner: The best in recent years is Facebook (FB), after Facebook botched its IPO.
"
367,HPQ,"The stock had gone public (at 38) and traded down immediately. It bottomed around 17 even though the company was doing great. But there were clouds of controversy that pummeled the stock.
"
368,HPQ,"I bought after the IPO. I didn't buy it all on one day. My (average price per share) was in the 20s.
"
369,HPQ,"While the stock was going down, the company was rolling out newsfeed ads. It seems like ancient history, but newsfeed ads are relatively new. About the time of the IPO, they stopped relying on ads for PC-based service and shifted to newsfeed ads that appeared on mobile devices. It was a fundamental transformation of their business model. That's Facebook's story today.
"
370,HPQ,"IBD: Should people think of Growth Discovery as a GARP (growth at a reasonable price) strategy?
"
371,HPQ,"Weiner: A lot of the fund would be recognizable as a GARP basket. That's OK. But in addition, I try to buy the best growth names in the market, the ones that are going to turn into big, sustainable, valuable franchises. That's a little different from GARP.
"
372,HPQ,"My top 40 names are 65% of my assets. Not every name will become a brand-new, unbelievable franchise. Some already have great franchises. Some will become great. But if you look at every decade — and I know this from some of the publications that William O'Neil sends me — in the '60s, '70s, '80s, '90s and so on, and look at the monster stocks, there are never that many. I try to buy those sorts of names.
"
373,HPQ,"IBD: You are allowed to invest in any market-cap size, but the fund has been large-cap oriented for a long time. Its heaviest weighting was in megacaps as of Sept. 30. Why those, why U.S. ones?
"
374,HPQ,"Weiner: Let's take the U.S. piece first. The U.S. economy is doing better than the average developed nation's, so it's fortuitous to be U.S. investors in this day.
"
375,HPQ,"And why so many megacaps? If you look at Internet models, the (successful) ones are global, scalable, enjoy incredible network effects and are viral. That's what we want.
"
376,HPQ,"I point to Facebook. The biggest companies, like that, enjoy increased returns as they get bigger.
"
377,HPQ,"If you were a manufacturer 50 years ago, you might have experienced decreasing returns for every single additional widget you made. They had to be sold at lower margins to incent the market to buy your product. In the Internet age, it's the opposite: increased returns.
"
378,HPQ,"The other thing about the Internet is that it's a winner-takes-the-most dynamic. Google (GOOGL) is the leader in search. That is a winner-takes-all battle, and they won.
"
379,HPQ,"It's to be determined in the OTA (online travel agency) space. You've got Facebook, Expedia (EXPE), TripAdvisor (TRIP) and a bunch of other ones. (This may also turn into a winner-takes-all space.) That's why we haven't invested in Priceline (PCLN). I have no skin in that game.
"
380,HPQ,"IBD: Why did you boost your Apple (AAPL) weighting to 5.8% as of Oct. 31 from less than 1% as of March 31 and 2.3% as of June 30?
"
381,HPQ,"Weiner: Full disclosure: I have not done a great job trading Apple in the last five years. I give myself low marks on that one. I can make a long list of Apple's positives and negatives. I've focused on the negatives in the last five years. I'm not going to do that any more.
"
382,HPQ,"I live two blocks from an Apple store. When the iPhone 6 came out there was a line around the block. It was crazy. I can't ignore that.
"
383,HPQ,"I could lecture about how smartphones are fully penetrated and the rate of innovation is slowing down. And how Android has outshipped Apple iOS five to one and usually the volume leader wins in tech. Actually, it always does! But the negatives haven't mattered (to Apple's stock performance).
"
384,HPQ,"IBD: So you've decided — at least for the moment — that all is not lost for Apple?
"
385,HPQ,"Weiner: One of the key buckets of stock I've avoided is large-cap tech legacy players: Oracle (ORCL), EMC (EMC), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Microsoft (MSFT) and on and on. I generally underweight them. I'm mindful that they have secular challenges. When that happens, you never know if they will catch up. IBM (IBM) for years faced them but somehow always punched out good earnings. But that may be changing. Last quarter was terrible for them.
"
386,HPQ,"When secular challenges catch up to a company, it's all over. In the 1990s, I was a tech analyst covering Compaq, Tandem, Digital, Stratus, Data General. They faced secular challenges. When the wave hit, they fell over. They don't exist now (as independent companies).
"
387,HPQ,"Apple is a huge, good legacy story relative to other legacy players. That's another justification for owning Apple.
"
388,HPQ,"IBD: You held Illumina (ILMN) as of Oct. 31. You're a fan of the outlook for gene sequencing, right?
"
389,HPQ,"Weiner: Yes. Illumina is an incredible company, helping to unlock the secrets of sequencing genomes for just $1,000. The way we practice medicine is changing because of companies like Illumina.
"
390,HPQ,"If you look backwards, people were doing one human genome. Now they're sequencing thousands. In the future, you will have your genome when you go to the doctor. That's where Illumina comes in.
"
391,HPQ,"IBD: Will Alexion (ALXN) remain a play on a single drug, Soliris?
"
392,HPQ,"Weiner: My Alexion thesis (as of my latest disclosure) was this: they are a super orphan-drug company. They only go after indications with small patient populations, where they get a lot of money for life-saving drugs.
"
393,HPQ,"They've increased the number of indications Soliris is sold for. And behind that there is another drug they're hoping for FDA approval for, for a new set of indications.
"
394,HPQ,"It's hard for society to say it will not pay for a drug, and your child will live for only a couple of years. If society pays for the drug, your child will have a normal outcome. It's a big ethics debate. But bottom line: countries are paying for these drugs.
"
395,HPQ,"IBD: How similar is Gilead's (GILD) story?
"
396,HPQ,"Weiner: They have great risk-reward. They beat the competition. There will be others with cures for hepatitis C. They will get market share. But Gilead will get the majority market share. If you have hep C, you want this drug immediately.
"
397,HPQ,"One knock against the drug is that some people don't like to invest in companies that cure a disease. Then the treatment is a one-shot deal. Some people say, 'Isn't it better to develop a treatment for HIV that requires patients to take a pill every day?' But there's still plenty of room for the hep C drug.

"
403,HPQ,"IBD: What drives Ulta Beauty (ULTA)?
"
404,HPQ,"Weiner: What I like about Ulta is that beauty has high emotional content for women. Ulta gives them the ability to walk into a mall-based, completely dedicated beauty retailer and not have to walk halfway across a department store to get to a beauty counter. And Ulta has a growing number of prestige brands. Years ago, prestige brands wouldn't sell through them. Now they do.

412,HPQ,"Alibaba's gross merchandise value is larger than Amazon (AMZN) and eBay's (EBAY) combined.Jason Weiner is like Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers.Season after season, he keeps performing at a high level.Since Feb. 2, 2007, when Weiner became the signal caller for the now $1.3 billion Fidelity Growth Discovery Fund and its adviser-sold twin $2.8 billion Advisor Equity Growth Fund , Growth Discovery has notched an 8.48% average annual gain vs. 7.03% for the S&P 500. Its performance ranks in the top 30% of its large-cap growth peers, tracked by Morningstar Inc.Weiner has used the same approach for most if not all of his tenure, he says. He seeks undervalued growth stories and stocks with potential for price-earnings expansion, avoiding overly costly names.Weiner, 45 years old, talked with IBD from his office in Boston about how he invests.IBD: Jason, if you ever had a mentor, who was it?Weiner: I've had tons of mentors. On the rare occasions when (Fidelity) rolls me out to meet MBAs visiting Fidelity, I tell them they should find a mentor, either outside their workplace or inside, or preferably both.It's super important, going back to when I was 15 and had my first job. I got it from a family friend, Lou, who was a great influence. It was Lou Nargiso, and he owned a gas station-auto repair shop. He was a World War II vet, and he learned auto repair in the army.He was a very well-educated person and philosophical. He liked to debate things. Everyone who worked for Lou was very loyal to him, as was he to them. His shop was also kind of a clubhouse for his World War II vet buddies, and I hung out with them. Good times!IBD: And at Fidelity?Weiner: At Fidelity, Will Danoff (manager of Fidelity's $111.1 billion Contrafund , $28.9 billion Advisor New Insights , $6.4 billion Series Opportunistic Insights and $884.8 million Advisor Series Opportunistic Insights has been a great mentor.I don't remember exactly when it kicked off. It might have been around 1993. We were both on a train. Will was going to southern Connecticut, visiting his parents. We sat next to each other. I worked for him later. I gained a lot of wisdom. Will is super focused on studying each decade, understanding monster stocks in each decade, and being in the elephant-hunting business — hunting stocks that go on to make monster gains.If you owned Dell in 1990, for the next 10 years nothing else mattered. It's the beauty of incredible growth stories. Will was focused on that, and I have adopted that strategy.IBD: Overall, you look for undervalued growth stories and stocks with potential for price-earnings expansion, right?Weiner: You only get paid for two things with growth stocks. First, for P-E expansion. Second, for underlying earnings growth of the companies you invest in.Typically, I focus on the growth rate of companies. That's where fundamental research can bring value. And I try to leverage Fidelity's research engine a lot.It's a little harder to predict P-E.IBD: And you try to avoid valuations that are too high, correct?Weiner: If you can enter a name you like when there's controversy or doubt that casts its P-E lower, that's a great opportunity.IBD: Give me an example, please.Weiner: The best in recent years is Facebook (FB), after Facebook botched its IPO.The stock had gone public (at 38) and traded down immediately. It bottomed around 17 even though the company was doing great. But there were clouds of controversy that pummeled the stock.I bought after the IPO. I didn't buy it all on one day. My (average price per share) was in the 20s.While the stock was going down, the company was rolling out newsfeed ads. It seems like ancient history, but newsfeed ads are relatively new. About the time of the IPO, they stopped relying on ads for PC-based service and shifted to newsfeed ads that appeared on mobile devices. It was a fundamental transformation of their business model. That's Facebook's story today.IBD: Should people think of Growth Discovery as a GARP (growth at a reasonable price) strategy?Weiner: A lot of the fund would be recognizable as a GARP basket. That's OK. But in addition, I try to buy the best growth names in the market, the ones that are going to turn into big, sustainable, valuable franchises. That's a little different from GARP.My top 40 names are 65% of my assets. Not every name will become a brand-new, unbelievable franchise. Some already have great franchises. Some will become great. But if you look at every decade — and I know this from some of the publications that William O'Neil sends me — in the '60s, '70s, '80s, '90s and so on, and look at the monster stocks, there are never that many. I try to buy those sorts of names.IBD: You are allowed to invest in any market-cap size, but the fund has been large-cap oriented for a long time. Its heaviest weighting was in megacaps as of Sept. 30. Why those, why U.S. ones?Weiner: Let's take the U.S. piece first. The U.S. economy is doing better than the average developed nation's, so it's fortuitous to be U.S. investors in this day.And why so many megacaps? If you look at Internet models, the (successful) ones are global, scalable, enjoy incredible network effects and are viral. That's what we want.I point to Facebook. The biggest companies, like that, enjoy increased returns as they get bigger.If you were a manufacturer 50 years ago, you might have experienced decreasing returns for every single additional widget you made. They had to be sold at lower margins to incent the market to buy your product. In the Internet age, it's the opposite: increased returns.The other thing about the Internet is that it's a winner-takes-the-most dynamic. Google (GOOGL) is the leader in search. That is a winner-takes-all battle, and they won.It's to be determined in the OTA (online travel agency) space. You've got Facebook, Expedia (EXPE), TripAdvisor (TRIP) and a bunch of other ones. (This may also turn into a winner-takes-all space.) That's why we haven't invested in Priceline (PCLN). I have no skin in that game.IBD: Why did you boost your Apple (AAPL) weighting to 5.8% as of Oct. 31 from less than 1% as of March 31 and 2.3% as of June 30?Weiner: Full disclosure: I have not done a great job trading Apple in the last five years. I give myself low marks on that one. I can make a long list of Apple's positives and negatives. I've focused on the negatives in the last five years. I'm not going to do that any more.I live two blocks from an Apple store. When the iPhone 6 came out there was a line around the block. It was crazy. I can't ignore that.I could lecture about how smartphones are fully penetrated and the rate of innovation is slowing down. And how Android has outshipped Apple iOS five to one and usually the volume leader wins in tech. Actually, it always does! But the negatives haven't mattered (to Apple's stock performance).IBD: So you've decided — at least for the moment — that all is not lost for Apple?Weiner: One of the key buckets of stock I've avoided is large-cap tech legacy players: Oracle (ORCL), EMC (EMC), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Microsoft (MSFT) and on and on. I generally underweight them. I'm mindful that they have secular challenges. When that happens, you never know if they will catch up. IBM (IBM) for years faced them but somehow always punched out good earnings. But that may be changing. Last quarter was terrible for them.When secular challenges catch up to a company, it's all over. In the 1990s, I was a tech analyst covering Compaq, Tandem, Digital, Stratus, Data General. They faced secular challenges. When the wave hit, they fell over. They don't exist now (as independent companies).Apple is a huge, good legacy story relative to other legacy players. That's another justification for owning Apple.IBD: You held Illumina (ILMN) as of Oct. 31. You're a fan of the outlook for gene sequencing, right?Weiner: Yes. Illumina is an incredible company, helping to unlock the secrets of sequencing genomes for just $1,000. The way we practice medicine is changing because of companies like Illumina.If you look backwards, people were doing one human genome. Now they're sequencing thousands. In the future, you will have your genome when you go to the doctor. That's where Illumina comes in.IBD: Will Alexion (ALXN) remain a play on a single drug, Soliris?Weiner: My Alexion thesis (as of my latest disclosure) was this: they are a super orphan-drug company. They only go after indications with small patient populations, where they get a lot of money for life-saving drugs.They've increased the number of indications Soliris is sold for. And behind that there is another drug they're hoping for FDA approval for, for a new set of indications.It's hard for society to say it will not pay for a drug, and your child will live for only a couple of years. If society pays for the drug, your child will have a normal outcome. It's a big ethics debate. But bottom line: countries are paying for these drugs.IBD: How similar is Gilead's (GILD) story?Weiner: They have great risk-reward. They beat the competition. There will be others with cures for hepatitis C. They will get market share. But Gilead will get the majority market share. If you have hep C, you want this drug immediately.One knock against the drug is that some people don't like to invest in companies that cure a disease. Then the treatment is a one-shot deal. Some people say, 'Isn't it better to develop a treatment for HIV that requires patients to take a pill every day?' But there's still plenty of room for the hep C drug. There are millions of patients who don't have the drug yet.IBD: Chipotle's (CMG) earnings growth has accelerated for two quarters.Weiner: It's a great franchise with tons of room for growth. The secret is that people will pay more for food that they think is higher quality.IBD: What about Sherwin-Williams (SHW)?Weiner: This is one of the greatest companies that nobody recognizes.Their paint store franchise is so valuable. They're vertically integrated. Professional painters make their first daily stop at Sherwin-Williams, not Home Depot (HD) or Lowe's (LOW). They know how to treat pros. They have lots of pricing power. Material costs are not a big deal. Most (end users) are people restoring or remodeling homes. It does not depend on home sales.IBD: What drives Ulta Beauty (ULTA)?Weiner: What I like about Ulta is that beauty has high emotional content for women. Ulta gives them the ability to walk into a mall-based, completely dedicated beauty retailer and not have to walk halfway across a department store to get to a beauty counter. And Ulta has a growing number of prestige brands. Years ago, prestige brands wouldn't sell through them. Now they do.Beauty products have high margins.

463,HPQ,"Personal computer and printer maker HP Inc. (HPQ) continues to slump on diminished prospects for the PC market in 2016.HP stock on Thursday fell to its lowest level since it split from the former Hewlett-Packard on Nov. 1. HP shares were down 3% near 9 in afternoon trading on the stock market today. Earlier in the session, the stock fell as low as 8.92. HP had climbed as high as 14.82 post-split.RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani on Thursday maintained his sector perform rating on HP stock but cut his price target to 11 from 13. He also lowered his estimates for HP’s fiscal 2016 “to reflect weaker market fundamentals.”“Recent PC-centric data points suggest to us that not just demand is soft, but there is also a continued PC inventory overhang, especially in Europe, that could negatively impact results in first half 2016,” Daryanani said in a report. “Similarly, we think both the print hardware and supplies businesses could have muted outlooks for fiscal 2016, based on Canon (CAJ) results/outlook and (foreign-exchange) movement.”HP is scheduled to report fiscal-first-quarter results after the market close on Feb. 24.HP executives have said the PC market will be challenging for several quarters but had expressed optimism for the second half of 2016. They had hoped Microsoft’s (MSFT) Windows 10 operating system would help drive PC sales, particularly with enterprise customers, later in the year.""HP should see challenging growth dynamics through fiscal 2016 on foreign-currency translation headwinds, competitive industry pricing, and PC channel inventory issues,” Daryanani said.On Wednesday, Sterne Agee CRT analyst Rob Cihra reiterated his neutral rating on HP stock but cut his price target to 11 from 14.“While global PC demand remains weak and supply/demand negative starting calendar 2016, we actually believe HP’s PC inventories are in better shape than most, an ironic product of its weaker share in China,” Cihra said in a report. “But we still see a particularly weak start to the year.”Cihra is forecasting the PC market will unit declines of about 5% year over year in 2016, but HP could offset the industry decline through market share gains as the top-tier players continue to consolidate.The cash-cow printing business looks even weaker than PCs this year, Cihra said.On Tuesday, Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brent Bracelin maintained his sector weight rating on HP stock but lowered his estimates for HP for this year and next based on “eroding PC and printing fundamentals.”RELATED:Apple Bucks Declining PC Sales TrendHP Inc.

464,HPQ,"Having just completed their first quarter since the Nov. 1 split of their former parent company, the stock of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, the Big Data and hybrid cloud operations of the old Hewlett-Packard Co., has outperformed its sibling HP Inc., which retained the legacy personal computer and printer business.The new Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) fell 2.5% in the stock market today, to 13.45. True, that's 15% off its all-time set Dec. 1 at 15.88, but HP Inc. (HPQ) is trading 33% below its post-Nov. 1 high of 14.82, touched Nov. 24. It fell 0.9% to 9.88 on Tuesday.""Upon the split we argued in favor of HPE over HPQ stock,"" wrote UBS analyst Steven Milunovich in a research note Tuesday. ""Hewlett Packard Enterprise has momentum with expected slight revenue growth in constant currency and an improving operating margin in fiscal 2016. This outlook was reinforced on the last earnings call (Nov. 25).""In contrast, HP Inc. told investors it would be investing for long-term gain. Our initial issue was the unsustainability of printer margins, but then unit demand fell apart last quarter. We remain concerned that HPQ estimates could be too high.""For the fiscal first quarter ended Jan . 31, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the Enterprise company to report earnings down 17% to 40 cents per share on revenue down 2.7% to $12.68 billion, vs. a pro forma 48 cents on $13.03 billion in the 2015 Q1.Analysts expect the performance of HP Inc., the PC/printer company, to slide further than Enterprise, with Q1 earnings down to 36 cents on falling sales to $12.23 billion.For fiscal 2016 ending Oct. 31, the Enterprise company expects earnings of $1.85-$1.95 per share minus items, vs. the $1.84 pro forma earned in 2015.  It guided revenue to $50.81 billion, down from the pro forma $52.12 billion of 2015.Analysts expect 2016 EPS of $1.87 minus items on revenue of $50.68 billion.Hewlett Packard Enterprise and analysts expect profitability and sales to improve in 2017 and beyond.Reiterating a buy rating and 18.50 price target on Enterprise, Milunovich said: ""HPQ is slightly less expensive than HPE on all measures, but we prefer HPE's better earnings momentum. Even discounting HPE's segment P/Es by 20%-30% relative to comps results in an overall multiple of almost 10x and a price target of $18.50. The stock looks more expensive on current but inexpensive on normalized free cash, which we expect to be achieved in fiscal 2018.""UBS rates HP Inc. as neutral with a 15 price target.Meg Whitman, who remains chair of both companies, took the CEO title of Hewlett Packard Enterprise as she had with the former company, but named Dion Weisler CEO of HP Inc.Both companies are expected to report fiscal Q1 earnings this month.

523,HPQ,"Initial jobless claims fell by 5,000 last week to 267,000, the Labor Department said Thursday. The four-week average rose by 1,750 to 272,500, a three-month high.But by either measure, unemployment filings have held below 300,000 for almost the entire year, hitting a long-term low in July. Sub-300,000 readings normally signal booming job gains, but not in this economic cycle.Net job growth has been mediocre. Yes, there have been layoffs. Hewlett-Packard, now split into HP Inc. (HPQ) and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), announced plans to cut 30,000 workers. Oil services firms Schlumberger (SLB), Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) have announced tens of thousands of job cuts as demand plunges with the price of crude.But jobless claims and layoffs aren't the culprit. The problem is that actual gross hiring — hiring before any job cuts or exits — still hasn't returned to pre-recession levels, according to Labor's JOLTS report. Truth be told, gross hiring wasn't booming in the prior 2001-2007 expansion either, so failing to live up even to that pace isn't encouraging.Weak gross hiring likely is one reason why the labor force participation rate, including among prime-age workers, remains so low. Weak hiring — and firing — also suggest a less-dynamic economy. Some labor market churn is good, as workers move to more-productive jobs and industries.Follow Ed Carson on Twitter @IBD_ECarson and on Facebook.

525,HPQ,"Avago Technologies has been one of the hottest stocks in tech this year, thanks in no small part to the chipmaker's ties with the world's top-valued company, Apple.Now Avago's (AVGO) ties to Apple (AAPL) will strengthen when the former takes over chip company Broadcom (BRCM). In a deal valued at $37 billion, the new entity will take the Broadcom name, and Avago Chief Executive Hock Tan will head the combined firm.The two complement each other as Apple contractors, supplying chips to different parts of Apple's iPhone and other smartphones — Avago makes radio frequency chips and filters, and Broadcom produces controller and Wi-Fi combination chips. Set-top boxes and cars also use Broadcom chips.Avago expects the Broadcom deal to close early in the first calendar quarter of 2016. Avago has already been working on integration plans to get a head start on day one.""Avago has done a great job in integrating companies and cutting costs out of operations,"" analyst Thomas Diffely of D.A. Davidson told Investor's Business Daily.Diffely said in the shorter term, Avago will benefit from hundreds of millions of dollars in cost savings from the Broadcom merger as it integrates the two operations.""Over time, Avago will have a more integrated chip solution for the mobile consumer in particular,"" Diffely said.HP OriginsAvago got its start in the 1960s as the semiconductor arm of Hewlett-Packard, now HP Inc. (HPQ). It later became part of Agilent Technologies (A) before private equity investors bought the business in 2005 and took it public in 2009.Shares have climbed steadily since that IPO, which was priced at 15. Avago's shares now stand at roughly 149, after surging 90% in 2014 and another 47% this year.Revenue also has been on a strong uphill run, more than quadrupling from $1.5 billion in 2009 to $6.9 billion in 2015. The 2015 number is up 60% from 2014.In addition to being used in Apple's new iPhone 6s and other smartphones, Avago's chips are found in data networking, telecom equipment and industrial uses. The firm's two biggest business segments, in wireless and networking, have grown through a string of acquisitions in recent years.Five Firms In Two YearsIn the last two years alone, Avago acquired five companies, including data-center chipmaker LSI for $6.6 billion; PLX Technology, which makes integrated circuits; and most recently, the networking company Emulex.As Broadcom merges with Avago, revenue in 2016 likely will grow another 8% to $7.39 billion, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. But Avago still will trail No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) and fellow chip company and Apple supplier Qualcomm (QCOM).Avago singled out one customer for contributing more than 20% of revenue in the fourth quarter: Foxconn, the Chinese electronics contract manufacturer that rolls out iPhones for Apple.Slowdown SeenBut Avago's first quarter, which ends in January, is expected to see a seasonal slowdown in iPhones, a drop-off made more noticeable in the aftermath of the iPhone 6s launch and ramp-up. Avago expects wireless sales in the current first quarter to decline in the low-teens-percent range from the fourth quarter.Still, analysts don't seem worried for Avago's future.""Even if units are flat, Apple is still increasing content,"" Diffely said.Other handset makers trying to close the gap with Apple, such as Samsung and China's Huawei, will need advanced technology, he adds.""Bottom line, the need for advanced chips for these phones continues to rise,"" Diffely said.Morgan Stanley analyst Craig Hettenbach expects a sharp acceleration in Avago's wireless business during the second half of 2016, aided by new capacity to handle new wafer sizes and higher dollar value content in premium filters due to rising LTE penetration and new wireless bands. (LTE is a high-speed wireless standard.)""Now that the quarter is out of the way and, importantly, numbers are intact, we see Avago handily outperforming into 2016,"" Hettenbach said in a note to clients following the fourth-quarter report.Enterprise Storage BoomMeanwhile, Avago's enterprise storage business has been performing ""rather amazingly,"" Avago CEO Tan said in the fourth-quarter conference call in early December. Revenue in that October-ending quarter was up 9% from the third quarter, despite soft demand.Enterprise storage accounted for 35% of total revenue in the quarter. That was nearly as much generated by the firm's biggest division, wireless communications, which made up 37% of the total and was up 10% from the previous quarter.Avago expects its enterprise storage business to maintain its momentum in the first quarter, with revenue still growing slightly from the fourth quarter, Tan said on the call.""We also believe we may be gaining share in this segment,"" he added.Hettenbach noted that product enhancements via acquisitions of LSI, PLX Technology and Emulex likely helped Avago's enterprise storage business.The company's much smaller wired infrastructure business showed 2% revenue growth from the third quarter and 7% year-over-year. The even smaller industrial segment saw a 10% decline from the third quarter and a 7% drop from the year-earlier period, with the Americas and Japan the weakest regions.Total revenue in the quarter rose 15% over the earlier year to $1.85 billion, while earnings climbed 26% to $2.51 a share. Gross margin moved up to 62% from 58%.Analysts estimate that 2016 earnings will rise 8% to $9.71 a share, according to a poll by Thomson Reuters.

528,HPQ,"Looking to push the legacy (i.e. old) giant tech stalwarts to use their cash piles to buy their way into faster growth, FBR analyst Daniel Ives issued a research report Thursday that praised Microsoft (MSFT) for its transition but kicked others — Cisco Systems, Oracle, IBM and Hewlett Packard — for their ""treadmill approach"" to expansion.And then he issued a wish-list of his top 10 tech tie-ups for 2016.""It has been a choppy environment for tech players with a very bipolar IT spending backdrop,"" Ives said. ""On the large-cap front, we have seen many changes from the HP split (into HP Inc.

""We've done a significant amount of work over the past few years to take costs out and simplify processes, and these final actions will eliminate the need for any future corporate restructuring.""Cost savings are coming, in part, from the elimination of as many as 30,000 jobs from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, three years after the old, combined Hewlett-Packard cut 55,000 jobs. At the time of the September Q3 earnings release, the combined company had about 302,000 jobs.For Q4 2015, the old Hewlett-Packard estimated that EPS minus items for the entire company would range from 92 to 98 cents. The estimate excludes 80 cents in separation costs and other charges.Analysts ascribed more than half of that income, 52 cents, to the future Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Thomson Reuters analysts estimated Q4 revenue at $13.5 billion.For Q1, ending Jan. 31, analysts expect Enterprise to earn 44 cents per share, minus items, on $12.77 billion in revenue.In Q3, ended July 31, the old Enterprise Group sales rose 2%, with a 13% operating margin, the old company said.""While we have to wait for HP's Q4 results to see the first full post-split balance-sheet details, HPE's filings disclose a pro-forma cash and investment position totaled approximately $11.5 billion exiting Q3,"" wrote Stifel analyst Aaron Rakers in a research report. ""HPE's total debt position stands at (about) $16 billion; however, it is important to note that this includes about $10.6 billion on HP Financial Services debt. This leaves HPE net operating cash at approximately $5.5 billion exiting Q3 (excluding about $615 million of reported HPFS cash).""We would note that prior conversations have suggested that HPE will be focused on maintaining an investment-grade debt rating or a debt-to-EBITDA in the 2.0x-2.5x range.""We expect investors to focus on HPE's capacity to make strategic acquisitions.""Stifel initiated Hewlett Packard Enterprise with a hold rating.

557,HPQ,"HP Inc. (HPQ) is making ""Star Wars""-themed personal computers, but the Force definitely wasn't with the PC and printer maker late Tuesday when it reported fiscal-fourth-quarter earnings.HP's PC and printer businesses brought in revenue of $12.66 billion in fiscal Q4 ended Oct. 31, down 14.2% year over year. The PC and printer businesses racked up earnings before taxes of $1.16 billion, down 18%.The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company also gave disappointing guidance.For the current quarter, its fiscal Q1, HP expects earnings per share minus items of 33 to 38 cents, vs. analyst expectations for 42 cents. On a GAAP basis, it is targeting EPS of 27 to 32 cents, vs. Wall Street's view of 38 cents.For fiscal 2016, ending Oct. 31, 2016, HP expects to earn $1.59 to $1.69 a share excluding items, where analysts were modeling for $1.71. On a GAAP basis, its EPS guidance was in line with forecasts, at $1.50 to $1.60 vs. expectations for $1.54.HP did not give sales guidance.HP stock plunged 14% Wednesday, to 12.64.Needham analyst David Rold downgraded HP stock to hold from buy on Wednesday.Wells Fargo Securities analyst Maynard Um on Tuesday cut his valuation range on HP stock to 14.50 to 16, down from 16.50 to 18, but he continues to rate HP stock as outperform.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brent Bracelin reiterated his sector weight rating on HP stock, which he said was fairly valued between 13.50 and 14.'Consolidating Markets'The PC and printer markets are likely to be challenging for several more quarters, HP CEO Dion Weisler said on the company's earnings conference call with analysts.""Q4 was a difficult quarter and somewhat weaker than we expected,"" he said. HP remains a leader in two ""large, consolidating markets,"" he said.The PC market has been tough, especially in the consumer segment, because of elevated sales channel inventory, Weisler said.Also, Microsoft's (MSFT) Windows 10 operating system has yet to spark a rebound in PC sales.But on the commercial side of the PC business, HP achieved its highest market share position ever at 23.7%, Weisler said.""We believe that innovation and sprinkles of magic are key to differentiation as the PC market goes through consolidation,"" Weisler said. He pointed to the company's new lineup of enterprise and consumer PCs, including a Star Wars Special Edition Notebook PC made in partnership with Walt Disney (DIS) and Lucasfilm.The former Hewlett-Packard split into two companies on Nov. 1. HP Inc. sells personal computers and printers, while Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) sells information technology hardware, software and services to corporations and other enterprises. HP Inc. and HPE reported results together Tuesday, as Q4 was their last quarter together before their split.""Both companies are off and running,"" Meg Whitman, chairman of HP Inc. and chairman and CEO of HPE, said on the call. ""Each company has a clear, well-defined strategy and is well positioned to win in its respective market.""In Q4, HP's PC unit sales were down 12% from the year-earlier quarter, with desktops down 17% and notebooks down 5%. HP has walked away from volume PC deals that don't meet its profit margin targets, Weisler said.HP's printer hardware unit sales were down 17%, with commercial units down 23% and consumer units down 14%. Supplies revenue was down 10%.Speaking on CNBC on Wednesday, Whitman said HP Inc. performed well in a ""tough PC market.""While Windows 10 hasn't provided a catalyst yet for PC upgrades, she still says that will happen.""There's nearly 450 million PCs out there that are older than 4-1/2 years,"" she said. ""And at some point, our belief is that people are going to upgrade those PCs. And I think HP Inc. is well positioned when that happens.""Follow Patrick Seitz on Twitter @IBD_PSeitz and on Facebook.

""Most people don't understand that,"" she said.""Yesterday, we announced that we were partnering with Microsoft (MFST) Azure to provide the public cloud,"" she told CNBC. ""And then we have this great cloud system automation that helps you orchestrate your clouds in your data center. So if you think about where the money is spent today, interestingly, still about 85% of the spend is in traditional I.T. ... The next-biggest segment is private cloud. And the next after that is public cloud. And private and public cloud are growing at about the same rate.""So we are going right to the heart of what our customers are asking.

""Essentially, it remains difficult for us to understand the end game for HP.""Brent Bracelin, an analyst for Pacific Crest Securities, noted in a research report that ""the 7% increase in PC revenue was the highest in three years, on 10% unit growth and 12% commercial growth. April results demonstrate that management has executed well, juggling a large product and services portfolio that is in different stages of a turnaround.""We see the potential for further earnings and multiple expansion in the coming year as HP executes a turnaround and further right-sizes its operations.""Bracelin rates the stock outperform, with a price target of 30.

655,HPQ,"Tibco Software's lack of traction in cloud computing is a prime reason the enterprise software company will likely wind up in the hands of a private equity firm rather than being bought by a larger software company such as Oracle or SAP, some analysts say.Tibco (TIBX), a leading provider of infrastructure software, early Monday announced it had agreed to be sold for $4.3 billion, or $24 a share, to Vista Equity Partners, a private equity firm focused on software, data and tech-enabled businesses.The news comes nearly a month after Tibco said it hired Goldman Sachs to look at strategic options, including pursuing potential acquirers.Vista's purchase price is a 23% premium to Tibco's Friday closing price. The companies expect the deal to close next quarter.Tibco stock rose more than 21% Monday to 23.65.Like its industry overall, Tibco is transitioning its business model from collecting a large upfront software licensing fee to a software-as-a-service model, where users access the software as needed via the Internet cloud.The cloud transition also is a top priority for licensed-software giants Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP), but Tibco failed to move fast enough to the cloud, says Derrick Wood, an analyst for Susquehanna Financial Group.""And that is probably why there was no interest from Oracle or SAP,"" Wood told IBD.Earnings DropTibco's sales growth has slowed the past two years, and earnings were down the past year, as the company struggled through a poor economy, internal sales execution issues and a maturing market for its core business as it expanded into new areas such as business analytics software.The company earlier this month reported Q3 earnings and a fiscal Q4 forecast that missed Wall Street estimates. Sales for the quarter ended Aug. 31 fell 6% from the year-earlier quarter while its EPS ex items plunged 50%.Tibco had become a leading provider of middleware that acts as a glue for developing applications. The company's big push into data analytics came with its 2007 acquisition of Spotfire for $195 million.But in analytics and elsewhere, Tibco faced increasing competition from Oracle, IBM (IBM) and smaller cloud vendors, says Steve Koenig, an analyst for Wedbush Securities.""Tibco's market position with respect to the cloud was almost nowhere,"" Koenig said. ""It was a number of problems that really crept up on them and kind of snowballed over the last couple of quarters.""Tibco's challenges emerged as CEO Vivek Ranadive led an investment group that purchased the NBA's Sacramento Kings.Ranadive in May 2013 reached a deal to pay $347 million for a 65% interest in the team.The Kings' acquisition and the exit of top executives such as CFO Sydney Carey, who left last year, weighed on the company, Koenig says.""There is ample evidence to say that Vivek was not minding the store, at least not as well as he should have been, with him spending quite a bit of time on his basketball endeavors,"" Koenig said. ""And Tibco had not been very good at bringing in outside talent to shore up executive departures. Their bench was getting thinner and thinner.""SAP's announcement Sept. 18 that it would acquire Concur Technologies (CNQR), a maker of cloud-based travel and expense software, for $7.4 billion underscores the desire of the legacy software leaders to build stronger cloud businesses.Oracle, SAP and others want to appeal to a growing number of business software customers that prefer to pay monthly subscriptions rather than large upfront license fees, analyst Wood says.""There is less appetite from buyers for these older license models,"" he said.Large companies such as Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), IBM and SAP will likely focus on acquiring cloud data analytics software vendors in the near future, Bhavan Suri, an analyst for William Blair & Co., said in a research report Monday.""We believe that a number of pure-play business intelligence vendors will ultimately be acquired by some of the larger vendors that need analytics front ends for their existing data warehousing/integration stacks,"" Suri wrote. ""We believe that some of these larger vendors will look to achieve greater participation in the next-generation business intelligence space as the transition from legacy solutions continues, and that they will likely acquire as they have done in the past.""For its fiscal Q3, revenue for Tibco's core infrastructure business fell 26% following a 29% drop in Q2. And its optimization business, which is primarily Spotfire, fell 7% in Q3.Tibco is feeling the effects from data analytics rivals that include Tableau Software (DATA), Koenig says.""In the analytics business, Tableau has taken the market by storm and squeezed Spotfire,"" he said.

It is a counterclaim to HP's attempt to get $5.1 billion in damages from Lynch and Sushovan Hussain, Autonomy's former chief financial officer.

The combined company will have to figure out which products to keep and what its unified storage strategy will be, Maestre said.""A merger of this magnitude reshuffles the market, and every vendor on the planet is already in attack mode looking to pick off as many customers as possible,"" Maestre said. ""That leaves Dell with a TON of work to do. They have to merge two completely independent product, sales and support organizations.""When the deal was announced on Oct. 12, HP issued a statement claiming that the Dell-EMC merger provided a ""real opportunity"" for HP.""Two of our largest competitors are attempting a highly distracting, multiyear merger, just as we are launching two new, focused companies,"" the HP statement said, according to Barron's . ""The massive debt burden Dell and EMC are taking on undoubtedly means that they will have to radically reduce R&D, and integration inevitably will create disruption as they rationalize product portfolios, channel programs and leadership.""Whitman later sent a memo to HP Enterprise employees titled ""Seize the moment,"" which hammered home the same points.HP is scheduled to split into two publicly traded companies on Nov. 1.

779,HPQ,"Cisco's product orders in Asia-Pacific, Japan and China rose just 1% in its fiscal Q3 ended April 25, vs. the year-earlier period. Minus China, growth would have been 8%, Cisco CEO John Chambers told analysts on the firm's earnings conference call.

792,HPQ,"But HP might have found a way to compete in China.
"
793,HPQ,"HP's move to sell a 51% stake in HC3, HP's China-based networking, server and storage services company, to Tsinghua University for $2.3 billion last month should give it continued access to China's market, analysts say.
"
794,HPQ,"HC3 was originally a joint venture of Huawei and 3Com, a U.S.-based networking equipment and security products maker. HP bought 3Com for $2.7 billion in 2010.
"
795,HPQ,"HP could also leverage the partnership to sell additional products such as wireless networking equipment from its recent acquisition of Aruba Networks, Mehra says.

829,HPQ,"Technology companies have long been the innovation trendsetters, turning in strong earnings reports that most often put the industry at or near the top of the best-performing groups.That, however, is not expected to be the case with a second-quarter earnings season that begins in earnest Wednesday with chip leader Intel (INTC).The consensus estimate for the 66 tech companies in the S&P 500 is for earnings growth to average just 2% from the year-earlier quarter — despite an expected huge quarter of 39% EPS growth from the biggest company of them all, Apple (AAPL). The strong dollar is hitting U.S. techs, and the PC industry slowdown is also having an impact.The 2% rise puts tech in the middle of the pack among the 10 industry groups in the S&P 500. It's the weakest growth for tech in nine quarters, as reported by Thomson Reuters. The S&P 500 tech companies' earnings per share growth in Q1 averaged 9.7%.""Tech has slowed down and there are not a lot of strong trends driving industry growth,"" said Gregory Harrison, an earnings analyst at Thomson Reuters.The S&P 500 tech companies' EPS growth had averaged 13% in the previous four quarters, more than double that of the S&P 500 overall in that span.The overall estimate for the S&P 500 is for a 3% decline in EPS, but that's due to the ailing energy sector, which is expected to show a 61% drop. Take out the energy sector and EPS growth for the S&P hits 4.6%, more than double the tech average.'Low-Growth Environment'""We're stuck in a low-growth environment, with only modest improvement expected for the rest of the year,"" said Bill Whyman, research analyst at Evercore ISI. ""Tech investors are always looking for acceleration, but expectations for Q2 and the second half of this year have been coming down.""Besides concerns about the strong dollar, the global economic weakness highlighted by the stock crash in Asia and the near-bankruptcy for Greece are among the reasons that 24 of the 66 tech companies in the S&P 500 have lowered their Q2 guidance. Only seven have raised their views.The upcoming release of the Microsoft (MSFT) Windows 10 PC operating system and a new line of microprocessors coming from Intel are not expected to be strong growth drivers. Wearable devices such as smartwatches might be a long-term positive, but that field is just getting under way. The same is true with augmented reality devices.Meanwhile, the seismic industry shift to cloud computing continues to disrupt, says Whyman. That significant technological shift is shaking the rafters of the largest information technology companies, he says.The emergence of cloud computing has shattered old ways of using technology. Companies, rather than buying large volumes of computer servers and storage systems needed for business operations, are instead turning to cloud computing services from Amazon.com (AMZN), Google (GOOGL), Microsoft and IBM (IBM), among others.Moreover, many providers of cloud services are buying lower-cost hardware from Taiwan and China, opting for stripped down hardware of their own design instead of brand-name products.That's hit IBM, Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Cisco Systems (CSCO), EMC (EMC) and other hardware vendors.Cloud computing has also spurred the growth in software-as-a-service business models. The SaaS model has enabled customers to pay only for what they use, instead of paying hefty fees for some services they don't need. Old-line software makers like Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP) have struggled to shift more of their products to the cloud.This disruption is happening amid slower sales of PCs, smartphones and tablets.Research firm Gartner said PC shipments fell 9.5% in Q2 from Q2 2014, to 68.4 million units. Gartner also lowered its chip sales forecast for the year, now seeing a rise of just 2.2% this year, to $343 billion. It had been forecasting 4% growth.Apple Suppliers UpbeatThat's a problem for Intel, by far the largest maker of PC microprocessors. After the close Wednesday, Intel is expected to post a 7% drop in EPS to 51 cents a share. Revenue is expected to fall 5% to $13.1 billion. Year-over-year sales were flat in the previous quarter.Some Apple chip suppliers, though, have higher expectations. Avago Technologies (AVGO), which supplies chips for the iPhone and other smartphones, is expected to show EPS growth of 70%. Skyworks Solutions, another Apple supplier, is expected to post 54% EPS growth.Overall smartphone growth is slowing, but not at Apple, which is seeing strong growth in sales of its iPhone 6 and 6 Plus line rolled out last fall.Apple reports its June-quarter earnings after the close on July 21. Its expected 39% EPS rise would mark its sixth quarter in a row of double-digit percentage gains. Revenue is expected to climb 33.5% to $50 billion.The slowdown in smartphones, however, is hitting Google (GOOGL) Android phones, which account for the vast majority of overall smartphone sales. Cellphone chip supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) is expected to show a 34% drop in EPS. Its revenue is expected to fall 14% to $5.5 billion. Qualcomm reports after the close on July 22.The tech trends have been a big issue for IBM, which has sold hardware businesses and has posted 12 straight quarters of year-over-year declines in revenue. The 13th quarterly decline is likely ahead. IBM, which reports after the close on July 20, is expected to report a 14% revenue drop, to $20.9 billion.As the buying and selling of goods shifts online, along with advertising and other services, some companies benefit. Google, which reports after the close Thursday, is expected to show a 16% rise in EPS. Revenue is expected to rise 11% to $17.75 billion, its sixth quarter in a row of double-digit growth.Also reporting that day is eBay, which is expected to show a 4% rise in EPS and a 3% increase in revenue to $4.5 billion.Another beneficiary of the shift to Internet communications and advertising is social networking leader Facebook (FB), which reports after the close July 29. Facebook is expected to post 12% EPS growth and 37% growth in revenue, to $3.98 billion.

832,HPQ,"Proofpoint has been on a buying spree, making relatively small but strategic acquisitions. The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based provider of security software via the cloud spent $24 million for NetCitadel and $35 million for Nexgate last year. In March, Proofpoint agreed to pay $40 million for security firm Emerging Threats.It was money well spent, CEO Gary Steele says, enhancing Proofpoint's (PFPT) capabilities in advanced threat intelligence, security for social media channels and automated security incident response. Proofpoint stock has roughly tripled in the past two years and sports a high IBD Relative Strength Rating of 94.Steele was brought in at Proofpoint's start in 2002, when the company focused almost exclusively on email security. He has overseen an evolution at Proofpoint, drawing on previous experience as CEO of applications company Portera, bought by Exigen Group in 2002, and at Sybase, Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ).Now Proofpoint is pioneering next-generation, cloud-based cybersecurity that combines Big Data analytics, threat intelligence capabilities and dynamic malware analytics to block cyberattacks. In Q1, Proofpoint said that revenue for its targeted-attack protection business more than doubled from Q1 2014. Overall revenue rose 35% to $57.8 million, Proofpoint's 47th consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth.Proofpoint says that its customers include 49 of the Fortune 100 companies, including Citibank (C), HCA (HCA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT).Steele said that companies are looking to avoid risks associated with malware delivered through email, among other risks. ""Because the stakes are so large and because the infrastructure available to the hacking community is so significant, these campaigns and these attacks will continue to evolve at a very, very rapid rate,"" Steele said. ""Fundamentally, the challenge for the security industry is to innovate at a faster rate than the hackers are. Some of the larger, incumbent security companies have struggled with the level of innovation that's required.""Proofpoint says that it devotes roughly 20% of revenue to R&D.Steele recently spoke with IBD about the security industry.IBD: What are your goals for Proofpoint in 2015 and 2016?Steele: When we look at the opportunity in front of us, we're very much focused on taking share from the larger incumbent vendors. As the security landscape has changed, customers are demanding additional protection, additional capability. We see today what's driving our growth is organizations searching for solutions that ensure they're well protected from this next generation of threats. We see organizations oftentimes running some legacy email security solution, plus some sort of anti-virus. Those capabilities don't protect these organizations from the targeted attacks that companies are being hit with today. We've developed a broad set of capabilities that identify and block those kinds of campaigns coming into the enterprise.Another key element of our growth is expansion, geographically. Roughly just under 20% of our business has come from international markets. We believe there is a significant opportunity of driving our solutions in international markets. We started this last year and will continue to invest because we see great opportunity outside the U.S., specifically in Europe and other international markets.IBD: How does your Nexgate Social Media Threat Center address social media threats?Steele: Our research has found that the Fortune 100 brands are experiencing at least one compromise a business day on their social media channel. As social has really grown within these organizations, so has the threat and risk associated with it. The reality today is that as large brands rely more heavily on social, they must have security because a hack or a compromise can have a significant impact on their overall brand.The opportunity for Proofpoint is to provide a level of security compliance that helps identify attacks that may come in through social. Now we're posting on people's social pages ... . We've coupled with that the integration of our back-end security capabilities, where we basically can deliver more depth and sophistication in the way which we can identify.We also see a big need for compliance. They have to make sure they comply with various regulations for their industry.IBD: Dridex, a malware that aims to steal online banking credentials when users log in to online bank accounts, is on the rise. What does that mean for the banking industry?Steele: One of the key themes we've seen in the threat landscape over the course of the last few quarters is Dridex attacks, coming through phishing, that basically have evaded the traditional anti-virus systems that people have in place. This has been a big challenge in the financial services industry, where these are pieces of malware that fundamentally go right through the legacy infrastructure. So it creates a huge amount of cleanup work on the part of the IT organizations. The only way this problem gets solved is if you're running modern architectures that block these kinds of advanced threats. This is a big theme, one of the current themes we see from hackers today. It will evolve and change, but it has been a huge headache for the financial services industry.IBD: What do folks need to know about phishing campaigns around the IRS and tax liabilities?Steele: One of the things that we have seen going into 2015 is a significant number of phishing campaigns focused around the IRS. A tax audit, a tax refund, these are very common phishing themes used by hackers to compel someone to click. They're quite effective, frankly. These broad campaigns started as we entered 2015. We saw a shift as we got to tax day on April 15 to much more about the refunds and scams around refunds. The hackers always follow the money. They're going to go where they know there's opportunity. Clearly, the IRS gets your attention.IBD: Proofpoint reported a 36% increase in subscription service in Q1, accounting for 97% of revenue. Is that where you want to be?Steele: What's really exciting is we have a fast-paced business model with a very high percent of recurring revenue. From an investor's perspective, the core benefit that we deliver, because we have such a high subscription number, is the fact that you get a very nice level of predictability. So we like that very high percentage of subscription revenue. It represents, when you look at our high renewal rate — which has consistently run over 90% with this broad, recurring base — a very powerful business model. We think that one of the most compelling aspects for investors is this high recurring revenue run rate.

"
882,HPQ,"Rackspace stock jumped 8% in midday trading Wednesday on a report early Wednesday from TechCrunch that Rackspace is considering going private after reviewing takeover bids from IBM (IBM) and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ).
"
883,HPQ,"TechCrunch reported that the HP bid was for $43 a share. Rackspace is trading near 36.50 in the stock market today, but was trading at 28.64 in midday before first an earnings beat then an announcement that it had hired Morgan Stanley to look at strategic options sent the stock rising 7%, and 18% in successive days, to 36.12.
"
884,HPQ,"Rackspace stock fell earlier this week when few buyers appeared interested.
"
885,HPQ,"The stock's surge on the going-private report shows that investors are still hoping for a buyout, perhaps spurred by the latest reports, says Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst for FBN Securities who rates Rackspace stock underperform.
"
886,HPQ,"""I think that investors are hoping more for a (buyout) deal than for it to go private,"" Seyrafi told IBD. ""But even if it goes private, it probably would be at a premium to the current share price, and that would also be a positive event near term.
"
887,HPQ,"""But I think investors are hoping for a (buyout), because arguably they can can get a higher price on the deal.""
"
888,HPQ,"Rackspace is in a tough spot. The company's year-over-year revenue growth the past three quarters has been stuck at 16%, while its EPS growth has declined.
"
889,HPQ,"Competition among other cloud service providers, including Amazon.com (AMZN), Google (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT), is a main reason, Seyrafi says.
"
890,HPQ,"""Most investors know the story for Rackspace has become more challenging with increased competition from Amazon Web Services, Google with their compute engine and others, Microsoft Azure, for example,"" he said. ""That competition is only increasing, and there is also increasing price cuts from AWS and others, so it does make sense for the company to try to see what is the best value they can garner in the marketplace.""
"
891,HPQ,"Going private might not have much upside, Seyrafi said: ""It's an option, but it doesn't solve a problem. They are still going to have the competition to worry about as a private company instead of a public company.

Rackspace is trading near 36.50 in the stock market today, but was trading at 28.64 in midday before first an earnings beat then an announcement that it had hired Morgan Stanley to look at strategic options sent the stock rising 7%, and 18% in successive days, to 36.12.Rackspace stock fell earlier this week when few buyers appeared interested.The stock's surge on the going-private report shows that investors are still hoping for a buyout, perhaps spurred by the latest reports, says Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst for FBN Securities who rates Rackspace stock underperform.""I think that investors are hoping more for a (buyout) deal than for it to go private,"" Seyrafi told IBD. ""But even if it goes private, it probably would be at a premium to the current share price, and that would also be a positive event near term.""But I think investors are hoping for a (buyout), because arguably they can can get a higher price on the deal.""Rackspace is in a tough spot. The company's year-over-year revenue growth the past three quarters has been stuck at 16%, while its EPS growth has declined.Competition among other cloud service providers, including Amazon.com (AMZN), Google (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT), is a main reason, Seyrafi says.""Most investors know the story for Rackspace has become more challenging with increased competition from Amazon Web Services, Google with their compute engine and others, Microsoft Azure, for example,"" he said. ""That competition is only increasing, and there is also increasing price cuts from AWS and others, so it does make sense for the company to try to see what is the best value they can garner in the marketplace.""Going private might not have much upside, Seyrafi said: ""It's an option, but it doesn't solve a problem. They are still going to have the competition to worry about as a private company instead of a public company.""It might make more sense for them to sell the company rather than go private.""

905,HPQ,"3D Systems (DDD) stock edged up Wednesday after the company raised its 2014 revenue outlook at its analysts day event on Tuesday.3D Systems told analysts it is on track in developing a high-speed printing platform for Google's (GOOGL) Project Ara, a modular smartphone expected to be launched in 2015.3D Systems stock has plunged 45% in 2014 as earnings have declined, though shares were up a fraction in afternoon trading in the stock market today.But on Tuesday, 3D Systems raised its fiscal 2014 revenue outlook to $695 million to $735 million, including its recent acquisitions of Medical Modeling and Robtec. The company's earlier guidance had been $680 million to $720 million. 3D Systems kept EPS guidance at 73 cents to 85 cents. Last year it posted EPS of 85 cents on sales of $513 million.3D Systems ""reiterated its target to achieve $1 billion in sales in 2015 on 30% organic growth,"" Amit Daryanani, an RBC Capital analyst, said in a report. ""While the $1 billion revenue target likely incorporates little revenue contribution from Google (as well as Hasbro, Hershey's), we view these developments as upside levers.""Google unveiled Project Ara, aimed at manufacturing entry-level, modular smartphones, in April. Google says consumers will be able to configure smartphones using a library of hardware modules — such as cameras, Wi-Fi antennas or battery compartments — built by outside developers.Under a deal with Google, 3D Systems is developing a new 3D printing process for miniature components. Analysts say the faster 3D technology could be used to manufacture other products if it pans out.""The development of a continuous fab-grade printer should open new growth opportunities within jewelry, aerospace, medical, and electronics markets given significant improvements in print speed (50x faster than current jetting technology) and material properties,"" added Daryanani.Citigroup analyst Kenneth Wong was also upbeat.""3D revealed seeing a 50x (increase) in print speeds from the platform developed for Project Ara,"" Wong said. ""We believe the ability to be first to market with a truly continuous manufacturing process would help validate 3D Systems' investments and the broader 3D printer market.""Weston Twigg, a Pacific Crest Securities analyst, says it's unclear when the faster 3D printing technology being developed for Google's project will be commercially available on a wide scale.""3D Systems is collaborating with Google to develop a very high throughput, high-quality, full-color, fully-automated printer designed to print thousands of parts per day,"" wrote Twigg in a report. ""The printer is expected to be 50x faster than current state of the art. This type of printer could catapult 3D printing forward in the manufacturing industry (with or without Project Ara's success).""Previously, 3D Systems indicated that this new platform would be commercially available by the end of 2015. At the analyst event, this time-line was not reiterated. But, the company expects it to be ready to support Google's planned Q1 2015 Project Ara launch.""We do not expect the commercial version to be ready by then, but we were assured that the commercial goals have not slipped.""3D Systems competes with Stratasys (SSYS), Voxeljet (VJET), ExOne (XONE) and others in the 3D printer market.

919,HPQ,"Hewlett-Packard has stepped up investments in cloud computing, prompting some analysts to speculate that it could make a big move such as acquiring Rackspace Hosting.That, however, would require HP (HPQ) to ratchet up its spending significantly, since Rackspace (RAX) could sell for $6 billion or $7 billion.HP in May said that it plans to spend $1 billion over the next two years to develop cloud products and services. At an annual conference for business customers in Las Vegas this month, the Palo Alto, Calif.-based HP said that it will expand from two data centers to 25 by the end of 2015. The data centers will be packed with servers and data-storage systems that customers rent via the cloud.HP is playing catch-up to Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com (AMZN), in the cloud field known as Infrastructure as a Service. Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL) and IBM (IBM) also are IaaS leaders.As in the case of IBM and other traditional IT suppliers, HP's sales of hardware and software could slow as more companies opt to rent computing technology rather than build new data centers of their own. That's why expanding into IaaS and related cloud products and services is a good move for HP, analysts say. HP stock is up nearly 25% in 2014 as the company is two years into its turnaround plan.Rackspace sells cloud services, including extra customer support and custom tools, as well as self-serve, on-demand IaaS products. The company is a co-developer, with NASA, of the open-source OpenStack cloud operating system.Would acquiring Rackspace, which has a market cap of $5.2 billion, boost HP's cloud strategy? Views are mixed.""It's possible that HP will decide to do something foolish, but I don't think Rackspace is a logical acquisition. Rackspace really hasn't been successful selling OpenStack to the enterprise,"" Lydia Leong, an analyst with market-research firm Gartner, told IBD. ""It would be a $6 billion to $7 billion acquisition.""And if HP were to spend so much on an acquisition, it could get a lot more for that money, Leong says.HP, IBM and Red Hat (RHT) are among companies that have embraced OpenStack, which helps companies connect private data centers to the public cloud.Large companies, though, have been slow to move big computing workloads to OpenStack. Amazon and others, meanwhile, have different cloud software.Some Pluses To Merger""An HP/Rackspace combination could drive favorable top-line synergies by combining Rackspace's strong brand in the cloud/hosting segment with HP's established enterprise sales channels as well as greater momentum in OpenStack, which both companies are actively sponsoring,"" Jonathan Atkin, an RBC Capital analyst, said in a recent research report.""However, Rackspace's lack of a highly automated (cloud) platform compared to earlier hosting/cloud takeout targets could present an additional operating challenge in the eyes of a potential acquirer,"" Atkin wrote.IBM acquired IaaS firm SoftLayer for $2 billion last year after taking a look at Rackspace, analysts say.Last month, San Antonio-based Rackspace hired Morgan Stanley to explore strategic options, including a sale or partnership. Rackspace's year-over-year earnings have fallen the past four quarters amid slowing revenue growth.Rackspace has been hurt by severe price cutting in the IaaS market, analysts say. AWS, by far the biggest IaaS company, in particular has been slashing prices.However, Jim Breen, an analyst at William Blair, sees Rackspace's OpenStack as possibly valuable for a potential acquirer.""Rackspace has had difficulty keeping pace with Amazon Web Services and with monetizing OpenStack's nascent popularity,"" Breen said in a research report. ""OpenStack is still in the early innings of paid deployment, and Rackspace lacks the enterprise reach of many of its competitors, namely Red Hat, VMware (VMW), HP and Microsoft.""Because Rackspace operates the largest production deployment of OpenStack and is the second-largest public cloud provider to AWS, it could be a strategic asset to other companies in the OpenStack ecosystem, such as AT&T (T), IBM, EMC (EMC), HP and VMware.""Most OpenStack supporters are pushing a hybrid cloud-computing model, which meshes both private and public infrastructure. Some business apps stay behind a private corporate-security firewall, but companies can access public IaaS providers for on-demand services.Gartner's Leong says that HP has hundreds of its own software engineers already working on OpenStack, one reason why it doesn't need Rackspace.Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan says that Rackspace has been augmenting its OpenStack-based platform with more VMware-compatible offerings.Some analysts say that Rackspace's market cap and asking price might put off HP and other possible buyers. Horan speculates that Rackspace might sell in the low to mid $50 per share range.""At around $7 billion, Rackspace would require a significant commitment,"" said UBS analyst Steven Milunovich, who has a neutral rating on Rackspace stock.Cisco Systems (CSCO) last month signaled that it is not interested in buying Rackspace.Mark Kelleher, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, downgraded Rackspace on Friday to underperform.""With the stock now trading at an enterprise value of approximately 7.5 times our 2015 EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) estimate, we believe the valuation is more than fair for the ongoing cloud business, given the growth profile,"" Kelleher said in a research note.

The company doesn't give bottom-line guidance, but said it expects its operating profit margin minus items to be zero, the same guidance it gave three months ago.Splunk's machine-to-machine analytics software helps companies uncover data bottlenecks in their software applications and data networks.

"
1018,HPQ,"Super Micro Computer (SMCI) is proof enough of that, using its expertise in product development and innovation to stay a step ahead of much larger rivals. The firm designs, develops, manufactures and sells server systems and solutions.
"
1019,HPQ,"Its products include servers, workstations, storage systems, server components, networking devices and server management software. Super Micro also provides services and support to clients. Its solutions are based on x86 architecture, the personal computer central processing unit (CPU) architecture and platform developed by Intel (INTC).
"
1020,HPQ,"Super Micro has delivered steady profits and solid revenue growth over the years by using its research and development expertise to produce innovative new products quickly, analysts say.

1021,HPQ,"""When new server components are introduced to the market by its partners, SMCI is typically first to respond with new servers that leverage the new components,"" noted Mark Kelleher, analyst at D.A. Davidson.
"
1022,HPQ,"One of the most important components is the CPU, he says. And one of Super Micro's key suppliers in that area is Intel.
"
1023,HPQ,"Intel Connection
"
1024,HPQ,"Intel typically introduces a new CPU architecture every year, then introduces an upgrade six months after the initial introduction. Intel's current high-end architecture is its Ivy Bridge-E architecture.
"
1025,HPQ,"""When Intel introduces a new CPU to the market, SMCI typically sees an upsurge of server sales as it takes advantage of the new product cycle,"" Kelleher said.
"
1026,HPQ,"That upsurge has been evident in Super Micro's recent financial returns. Last month, the company posted a 34% year-over-year gain in revenue for its fiscal third quarter, which ended in March. It was the biggest top-line increase in years and marked the sixth straight quarter of double-digit growth.
"
1027,HPQ,"Super Micro officials, who could not be reached for comment, have long touted the company's product innovation as one of its key growth drivers.

These initiatives include shifting its product mix toward higher-margin servers, better pricing for components such as disk drives, and the construction of a new manufacturing facility in Taiwan.
"
1031,HPQ,"Because of these moves, Super Micro ""should continue to see an upward trend in gross margins,"" Kelleher noted.
"
1032,HPQ,"During its fiscal third quarter, Super Micro posted a gross margin of 15.4%, up from 14.1% the prior year. The uptick was partly due to a rise in production at the Taiwan plant, which has made serving clients in Asia more cost-effective.

"
1035,HPQ,"Although Liang says Super Micro is ""continuously speeding up"" its business growth in Asia, the company still gets most of its business closer to home. North America accounted for 54% of Super Micro's overall sales during the fiscal third quarter. Europe was next at just less than 22%, followed by Asia at 21%. The rest came from other markets.
"
1036,HPQ,"Super Micro posted total revenue of $373.8 million during the quarter. That was up from $278 million the previous year and well above consensus estimates for $335.2 million.

1078,HPQ,"A few of the largest and oldest tech firms may finally get a shot at beating the upstarts in the fast-growing data analytics software market.
"
1079,HPQ,"Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Oracle (ORCL) and others are armed with software to tackle what is becoming a growing concern and a big pain for companies: how to derive useful information from the reams of social media conversations, e-mail and other unstructured data on the Internet.
"
1080,HPQ,"The old tech giants have been losing ground in the data analytics business to companies such as Tableau Software (DATA) and Qlik Technologies (QLIK) that have perfected ways of analyzing structured data. Structured data include spreadsheets and information from databases arranged in columns in a relational database system. Tableau's visualization software lets business professionals arrange structured data in easy-to-read charts and graphs without the need for IT departments.
"
1081,HPQ,"But so far, neither Tableau nor Qlik can tackle unstructured data — considered the next big virtually untapped territory for data analytics, says Daniel Ives, an analyst for FBR Capital Markets & Co.
"
1082,HPQ,"""Unstructured data is the Holy Grail,"" he told IBD. ""Cracking that nut is really the gold on the other side of the rainbow.""
"
1083,HPQ,"Companies see a growing interest in mining social media sites like Facebook (FB) for customer feedback and other insights into their operations, says David Schubmehl, an analyst for market tracker IDC.
"
1084,HPQ,"""This whole social media revolution has focused organizations' efforts on unstructured data (such as) Twitter (TWTR) and Facebook posts, and people are beginning to understand the potential value of unstructured data, so the future is very bright for this kind of analysis,"" he told IBD.
"
1085,HPQ,"For now, the structured data analysis market will be much larger — and will grow much faster than — unstructured analysis. By 2018, global sales of relational database software for working with structural data will reach $50 billion, up from $30 billion, says IDC.
"
1086,HPQ,"Global sales of non-relational database software for unstructured information are expected to reach $5.08 billion by 2018, up from $4.19 billion in 2013, IDC says. The market for unstructured data will likely accelerate as more companies become aware that it is an untapped resource, Schubmehl says.
"
1087,HPQ,"""Right now, we have estimated that 90% of the data available in the world today is unstructured information,"" he said. ""You have got people writing memos, emails, research reports, patents, discussing why they didn't like the Patriots' (Super Bowl) win and all of this is adding to the ever-growing amount of content that is out there.""
"
1088,HPQ,"But unstructured data are also a much tougher nut to crack for analytics firms, says Boris Evelson, an analyst for market tracker Forrester Research.
"
1089,HPQ,"""How do you parse your text? How do you identify grammar rules? How do you identify sentiment?"" he told IBD. ""That is still pretty much rocket science; a plug-and-play approach doesn't exist in the text analytics world.""

1108,HPQ,"""That is an enormous market opportunity for Tableau and they are in the early stages of penetrating that — and that is just structured data,"" he said.A few of the largest and oldest tech firms may finally get a shot at beating the upstarts in the fast-growing data analytics software market.Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Oracle (ORCL) and others are armed with software to tackle what is becoming a growing concern and a big pain for companies: how to derive useful information from the reams of social media conversations, e-mail and other unstructured data on the Internet.The old tech giants have been losing ground in the data analytics business to companies such as Tableau Software (DATA) and Qlik Technologies (QLIK) that have perfected ways of analyzing structured data. Structured data include spreadsheets and information from databases arranged in columns in a relational database system. Tableau's visualization software lets business professionals arrange structured data in easy-to-read charts and graphs without the need for IT departments.But so far, neither Tableau nor Qlik can tackle unstructured data — considered the next big virtually untapped territory for data analytics, says Daniel Ives, an analyst for FBR Capital Markets & Co.""Unstructured data is the Holy Grail,"" he told IBD. ""Cracking that nut is really the gold on the other side of the rainbow.""Companies see a growing interest in mining social media sites like Facebook (FB) for customer feedback and other insights into their operations, says David Schubmehl, an analyst for market tracker IDC.""This whole social media revolution has focused organizations' efforts on unstructured data (such as) Twitter (TWTR) and Facebook posts, and people are beginning to understand the potential value of unstructured data, so the future is very bright for this kind of analysis,"" he told IBD.For now, the structured data analysis market will be much larger — and will grow much faster than — unstructured analysis. By 2018, global sales of relational database software for working with structural data will reach $50 billion, up from $30 billion, says IDC.Global sales of non-relational database software for unstructured information are expected to reach $5.08 billion by 2018, up from $4.19 billion in 2013, IDC says. The market for unstructured data will likely accelerate as more companies become aware that it is an untapped resource, Schubmehl says.""Right now, we have estimated that 90% of the data available in the world today is unstructured information,"" he said. ""You have got people writing memos, emails, research reports, patents, discussing why they didn't like the Patriots' (Super Bowl) win and all of this is adding to the ever-growing amount of content that is out there.""But unstructured data are also a much tougher nut to crack for analytics firms, says Boris Evelson, an analyst for market tracker Forrester Research.""How do you parse your text? How do you identify grammar rules? How do you identify sentiment?"" he told IBD. ""That is still pretty much rocket science; a plug-and-play approach doesn't exist in the text analytics world.""Many technology players, including HP and Oracle, have used acquisitions to help them serve the emerging unstructured market.In one of the most controversial deals in recent history, HP paid $10.3 billion in 2011 to acquire Autonomy, a maker of software for sifting through unstructured data.That same year Oracle paid $1 billion to acquire Endeca, which makes business intelligence software analyzing unstructured data.More recently, Microsoft (MSFT) acquired Equivio, an Israel-based text analysis firm that can provide analysis of unstructured data.Other technology giants SAP (SAP) and IBM (IBM) have used acquisitions to build a capability for unstructured data analysis, Evelson says.""Among the big players, IBM has an edge, and SAP over the years has acquired a lot of unstructured data technologies,"" he said.So far, Tableau and Qlik both rely on third-party partners when customers require analysis of unstructured data.Tableau works with several partners including Splunk (SPLK) and Amazon.com (AMZN) units Amazon Relational Database Service, which helps customers set up a database in the cloud, and Amazon Elastic MapReduce, a Web-service that uses Hadoop open source database software to sift through large amounts of data.A Qlik spokesman says using third-party companies is an effective strategy because it offers an unstructured expert to better serve the customer.Others may be adopting a different strategy.Late last year, Salesforce.com (CRM) launched a data analytics software service to serve help companies with both structured and unstructured data.Some other data analytics players that focus on structured data will likely make a bigger push into unstructured data, Schubmehl says.""You will see a Qlik and Tableau and some of these other companies begin to offer that kind of capability as time goes on,"" he said.But not everyone agrees.Structured and unstructured data are two entirely separate businesses, says Steve Koenig, an analyst for Wedbush Securities.""The market for analytics on unstructured data is more fragmented; it's probably better conceptualized by application area or use case,"" he said in an e-mail to IBD.

1159,HPQ,"Two years after Microsoft (MSFT) purchased Nokia's (NOK) mobile phone unit, the software giant is moving to exit Nokia's entry-level feature phone business.Microsoft announced Wednesday that it is selling the business for $350 million to FIH Mobile, a Hong Kong-listed subsidiary of Taiwan-based contract manufacturer Foxconn, and HMD Global, a newly created company in Finland that has licensed Nokia's brand and intellectual property.Microsoft said it will continue to develop Windows smartphones, such as its Lumia devices, and will continue to support third-party handsets from partners like Acer, Alcatel, HP Inc. (HPQ), Trinity and Vaio.Feature phones are low-end devices that have limited capabilities compared with full-fledged smartphones. Feature phones are targeted mostly at customers in emerging markets.Microsoft bought the Nokia handset business in April 2014 for $7.5 billion, a deal negotiated by Microsoft's previous CEO, Steve Ballmer, in September 2013. Microsoft wrote off the entire value of the deal in July 2015 when it recorded an impairment charge of $7.6 billion related to the Nokia assets.“Microsoft’s exit from the feature phone business is not at all surprising,” IHS analysts Ian Fogg and Daniel Gleeson said in a research report Wednesday. “The deal again highlights Microsoft’s continued failure in mobile.”Microsoft’s smartphone future is “up in the air” because the company hasn’t released any new flagship handsets for Windows 10 Mobile in a while, they said.Microsoft shipped just 2.3 million smartphones in the first quarter, down 70% from Q1 2015, IHS said.“Realistically Microsoft can hope to be no more than a bit player in the mobile phone market now,” Fogg and Gleeson said.The smartphone market is dominated by Apple's (AAPL) iPhone and Android-based devices from Samsung and others.Microsoft stock rose 0.6% to 50.81 on the stock market today, but has been trading below its 50-day line since its earnings release late last month disappointed.

1160,HPQ,"Microsoft (MSFT) stock surged to an all-time high Friday in heavy trading, a day after it posted much better-than-expected September quarter results.Microsoft soared as much as 12.6% intraday to 54.07 on the stock market today, eclipsing its dot-com era peak of 53.98 in December 1999. Shares closed up 10.1% at 52.87.Late Thursday, Microsoft said it earned 67 cents a share excluding items on adjusted sales of $21.66 billion for its fiscal first quarter of 2016. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Microsoft to earn 59 cents a share on sales of $21.03 billion for the quarter, which ended Sept. 30. On a year-over-year basis, EPS rose 3% while sales fell 7%.For the December quarter, Microsoft expects sales of $25.1 billion, based on the midpoint of guidance. That edges just above Wall Street's consensus estimate of $25.08 billion, down 5% year over year. Microsoft did not provide EPS guidance, but analysts have been modeling for it to earn 72 cents a share, up 1%.Microsoft demonstrated ""continued progress on the transitional journey to the cloud (and way past the PC)"" in Q1, UBS analyst Brent Thill said in a research note Thursday. He reiterated his buy rating on Microsoft stock and raised his price target to 56 from 52.""Microsoft shares have had a tough time breaking through the $50 level on previous attempts, but we think the transitional pieces of this story are really starting to align and showcase a more innovative and focused company than previous iterations,"" he said.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brendan Barnicle was enthused by the fact that Microsoft guided current quarter results above expectations for the first time in several quarters. He rates Microsoft stock as overweight with a price target of 55.Here are five key takeaways from Microsoft's fiscal Q1 report:1. Cloud Transition Gaining MomentumMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella said the company is making progress in its shift to Internet cloud computing from desktop computing.Microsoft added about 3 million new consumer subscribers to its Office 365 cloud-based productivity software. It ended the quarter with 18.2 million consumer subscribers to Office 365.Commercial Office 365 monthly active users grew to 60 million, with nearly 60% using premium services, Nadella said.""We're making great progress towards our goal of $20 billion in annualized commercial cloud revenue run rate, which now exceeds $8.2 billion,"" Nadella said on a conference call with analysts. ""The results speak to our differentiated cloud strategy, expanded market opportunity, and the speed at which customers are adopting our services.""Microsoft has reached an inflection point in its Office business, Credit Suisse analyst Philip Winslow said in a research report Friday. Recurring subscription revenue from Office 365 last quarter more than offset the impact of customers transitioning from licensed software, he said.The lifetime revenue and operating profit of Office 365 likely will be ""meaningfully higher"" than the traditional license model, he said.Winslow maintained his outperform rating on Microsoft and raised his price target to 60 from 55.2. Microsoft vs. Amazon Cloud BattleThe enterprise cloud platform market has boiled down to two primary competitors: Microsoft and Amazon.com (AMZN), Nadella said.""While many companies are developing commercial cloud offerings, there are really only two driving enterprise cloud platform innovation at massive scale: Amazon and Microsoft,"" he said. ""We push each other, and we each have a unique approach.""Microsoft is taking a hybrid approach that combines corporate servers with cloud computing services. It has attracted such customers as Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), Jet.com and Alaska Air Group (ALK).Microsoft Azure revenue and compute usage has more than doubled year over year, Nadella said.The battle for public cloud infrastructure is clearly ""a two-horse race between Microsoft and Amazon,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross MacMillan said in a report Friday. He said both companies can be ""very profitable at scale.""MacMillan reiterated his outperform rating on Microsoft stock and upped his price target to 57 from 54.Microsoft has moved to the cloud quicker and more successfully than other mature tech companies, FBR analyst Daniel Ives said in a research report Friday. He kept his outperform rating on Microsoft stock and increased his price target to 60 from 53 ""to reflect a stronger cloud trajectory and better free-cash-flow growth.""3. Bing Search Business ProfitableMicrosoft's Bing search engine finally reached profitability during the September quarter, Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood announced on the call. Microsoft's Internet search business generated more than $1 billion in revenue in fiscal Q1.""We expect Bing's strong trajectory to continue, remaining profitable for the remainder of the year,"" she said.Bing's share of the U.S. market is now up to 20.7%, a distant second to Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google. Bing's advertising revenue grew 29% worldwide in Q1, helped by Windows 10 users asking Cortana more than 1 billion questions, Nadella said. Cortana is Microsoft's answer to Apple's (AAPL) Siri personal digital assistant.4. PC Hardware Partnerships EmphasizedNadella made an effort to appease Microsoft's Windows PC hardware partners when he discussed the company's own hardware initiatives, such as the new Surface Book notebook. Microsoft ruffled feathers when it introduced the Surface Book, which competes with products from Lenovo, Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) and Dell.He referred to Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 as ""premium devices"" that are coming to market along with those of ""OEM partners.""""We are also seeing hundreds of new device designs from our partners — the widest range ever for this holiday,"" Nadella said.5. Surface Sales Down Before RefreshSales of Microsoft's Surface tablets and convertibles dipped in the September quarter ahead of the company's product refresh. Microsoft announced its new Surface devices on Oct. 6.Surface sales faced tough comparisons to the same quarter last year when the Surface Pro 3 was fresh on the market.Surface sales totaled $672 million in fiscal Q1, compared with $908 million in the September quarter last year.Some Analysts Not ImpressedNot all analysts were bullish on Microsoft post-earnings.Goldman Sachs analyst Heather Bellini maintained her sell rating on Microsoft, but raised her price target to 45 from 40.Jefferies analyst John DiFucci kept his underperform rating on Microsoft stock, but increased his price target to 39 from 37.Cowen analyst Gregg Moskowitz reiterated his market perform rating, but upped his price target to 53 from 50. Microsoft posted a ""good all-around"" Q1, but the stock is fairly valued at the current level, he said.

The company also preliminarily guided revenue up 29-30% for 2016.The company's billings were ""white-hot,"" helped by a 90% subscription renewal rate, FBR analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a research report. Billings rose 37% year over year to $85 million, vs. the consensus forecast for $77.6 million and Proofpoint guidance for $77 million.""Proofpoint posted an impressive billings/revenue performance as it penetrated further into its existing installed base with solid cross-sell/upsell execution,"" Ives wrote.Ives rates Proofpoint stock outperform and maintained an 80 price target.Gaining Vs.

""At present, only 49% of Fortune 100 and 24% of Fortune 1000 (companies) use Proofpoint protection, presenting the company with large headroom to grow its install base,"" Nandury wrote.Nandury rates Proofpoint stock a buy, with a price target of 80.CEO Steele didn't say much about the partnership with Intel Security, but Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski called it a positive.""Management also hinted at several other partnerships that will be announced in 2016,"" he wrote in a research report. He added that the company's ""guidance already factors in a contribution from these partnerships.""Nowinski rates Proofpoint stock overweight, with a price target of 76.Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

1251,HPQ,"Shares of Redbox parent Outerwall (OUTR) tumbled Tuesday after the company announced that Scott Di Valerio has stepped down as CEO and resigned from the board, a major red flag coming just two weeks before Outerwall is due to report Q4 earnings.Outerwall was down 17% in midday trading in the stock market today, at a two-month low near 64.50.Outerwall narrowed its fourth-quarter guidance at or above its previous guidance range to assuage investors. It now expects Q4 sales of $598 million to $602 million and earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.40 to $2.52. Based on the midpoint of its guidance, EPS would be up 46% to $2.46 and sales would be up 1% to $600 million.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were modeling Outerwall to earn $2.06 a share on sales of $596 million. Outerwall is scheduled to report Q4 earnings after the market close on Feb. 5.Outerwall is expected to provide 2015 guidance on its Q4 earnings conference call. The Bellevue, Wash.-based company sees low single-digit revenue growth and core adjusted earnings from continuing operations to be in line with expected 2014 results.Nora Denzel, a member of Outerwall's board since February 2013, was appointed interim CEO. Denzel held various management positions at Intuit (INTU) from February 2008 through August 2012. Before that, she was senior vice president of the global software business unit and the storage and consulting divisions at Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) from August 2000 to February 2006. She also previously worked at Legato Systems and IBM (IBM).The resignation of Di Valerio blind-sided Wall Street. Outerwall stock on Friday reached an all-time high of 77.94.""The timing of this transition signals the board's dissatisfaction with the company's strategic direction and desire to bring in new blood,"" Dougherty & Co. analyst Steven Frankel said in a note Tuesday. ""The resignation of Mr. Di Valero clears the decks for the company to appoint an outsider as CEO, as opposed to in 2013 when the board chose Mr. Di Valero, who was then the company's CFO.""The company's raised guidance for Q4 EPS was a positive, but its 2015 guidance disappointed, Frankel said.The Q4 EPS upside is likely the result of a combination of share buybacks and lower-than-expected taxes, Frankel said.For 2015, Wall Street was looking for year-over-year growth of 5% in sales and 7% in adjusted earnings. That compares with management's target of low single-digit sales growth and flat earnings.""While in the short run strong cash generation from Redbox can drive continued share repurchases, we remain concerned that the inherent volatility of the box office combined with the rise of digital distribution and the shift toward episodic television pose serious challenges,"" Frankel said. The failure of its joint venture with Verizon (VZ) leaves Redbox without a digital strategy.""Without a clear vision on how the company drives per kiosk rental growth at Redbox and meets the challenges of the digital world, we remain Neutral rated,"" Frankel said.Outerwall is likely being conservative with its 2015 forecast because of the CEO transition and other ""moving parts,"" such as the recent Redbox price increase, Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said in a note Tuesday.In addition to its Redbox movie rental business, Outerwall runs Coinstar coin-counting kiosks, ecoATM mobile phone trade-in kiosks and is testing other in-store kiosks.RELATED:Redbox tells DVD movie renters to dig deeperRedbox Q3 profit growth surprises, adds loyalty program.

1252,HPQ,"Shares of both EMC (EMC) and VMware (VMW) dropped Tuesday as investors and Wall Street struggled to understand the complexities of the deal in which privately held tech giant Dell would swallow up the two enterprise computing companies.After a fall of 8.1% Monday, when Dell announced its pending acquisition of VMware majority owner EMC, VMware stock was down another 4% in afternoon trading on the stock market today, putting it at a more than two-year low near 69. EMC stock was down 2%, near 27, after climbing for nine straight sessions. Dell and EMC early Monday announced their merger, valued at $67 billion, the biggest pure-tech merger ever.But at least three investment banks downgraded EMC stock Tuesday as Wall Street parsed the transaction.The Byzantine deal involves issuing of a VMware tracking stock that lets Dell retain EMC's control of VMware — which some consider the most attractive part of EMC — with minimal capital outlays, analysts say. The terms also enable Dell to pay down $20 billion in debt that it needed when it went private in 2013. Analysts expect that the deal will lead to more industry consolidation.""Apparently they want control over VMware without paying for it,"" analyst Rajesh Ghai of Macquarie Securities told IBD. ""They want their cake and to eat it, too.""A complete VMware spinoff would have been better for VMware shareholders, Ghai says.""The stock's kind of taking a big hit because of the (deal's) stupid structure,"" Ghai said.A spinoff was what activist investor Elliott Management had been advocating for VMware, though Elliott came out in support of the Dell-EMC deal on Monday. Elliott executives could not be reached for comment on VMware's continued fall Tuesday. Neither Dell nor EMC responded to requests for comment.Dell Keeps Voting RightsThe terms of the deal allow Dell to pay $24.05 in cash and 0.111 share of a tracking stock linked to EMC's 81% control over VMware. The other 19% are traded on the NYSE. VMware had been trading above 80, and so the deal was estimated to be worth 33.15 a share of EMC. With VMware stock dropping, the value has fallen below 32.Ultimately, Dell will outright own 28% of VMware shares, 53% of shares will go to the tracking stock, and the other 19% will remain on the open market. Shareholders can freely trade the tracking stock, but the voting rights will remain in the hands of Dell.Some analysts, however, say that the deal at least solidifies VMware's future.""Overall, we view this as net positive for (VMware), as the deal removes future uncertainty, which has been the biggest overhang on the stock,"" UBS analyst Brent Thill said in a research note. ""Management noted that (Dell CEO) Michael Dell is aligned to driving shareholder value and committed to increasing economic interest over time, via buyback of either (VMware) tracking or common stock.""But Thill lowered his price target on VMware stock to 90 from 97. ""Our biggest concerns are around VMware management having to deal with a new owner as well as how the other strategic partners react to Dell building out a more complete stack,"" he wrote.Argus Research analyst Jim Kelleher downgraded EMC stock to hold from buy.""During a post-announcement conference call, executives of EMC, Dell and VMware stated that the potential for revenue synergies rather than cost synergies (was) driving the deal,"" Kelleher wrote. ""EMC (Chief Executive) Joe Tucci also acknowledged that amid unprecedented technology industry disruption, EMC's older products were tailing off more rapidly than earlier anticipated.""That may have given further impetus to this transformative deal, which comes amid shake-ups in other leading (information technology) companies such as the coming split-up of (Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) into two companies.""Follow Russ Britt on Twitter @IBD_RBritt and on Facebook.
"
1253,HPQ,"Now that Hewlett-Packard has split in two, the question for the iconic technology giant and pioneer is whether its divide-and-conquer strategy will spark a rebound and accelerate growth.
"
1254,HPQ,"HP's efforts to revisit the heights that it reached during the dot-com boom 15 years ago have largely failed. Its shares and market cap have lagged those of many contemporaries. So, 14 years after it mushroomed in size through the huge acquisition of Compaq, the Silicon Valley stalwart is downsizing.
"
1255,HPQ,"HP aims to unleash the growth-starved enterprise side of the company that serves businesses, and says that its consumer technology engine, run by PCs and its industry-leading printers, can keep chugging along despite few organic growth prospects.
"
1256,HPQ,"It's a risky gambit that could backfire, some observers say. Others say that it's the only way for HP to keep from becoming a dinosaur. While such tech titans as Apple (AAPL) find success and blue skies in new businesses, others such as IBM (IBM), Oracle (ORCL) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) see clouds, as in cloud computing, as they gaze into their crystal balls.
"
1257,HPQ,"""HP is trying to figure out how to get off the innovation treadmill that's going 2 miles per hour,"" said Daniel Ives, a tech analyst at FBR & Co. ""It makes sense that they're willing to do something to shake up the status quo.""

1258,HPQ,"Dell Does Opposite
"
1259,HPQ,"Investors gave a mixed greeting to the split stocks in their first day of trading Monday. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), which gets a new ticker, fell 1.6% to 14.49. But HP Inc. (HPQ), which retains the ticker Hewlett-Packard has used since it acquired Compaq, rose 13% to 13.83.
"
1260,HPQ,"Ives says the split-up isn't meant to reverse HP's oft-criticized 2001 purchase of then-giant PC firm Compaq Computer for $25 billion. Opinions on that deal vary, but observers note that other tech Goliaths are trying the same method to keep from being slain by Davids. Most notably of late, privately held Dell announced an agreement in October to acquire EMC (EMC), at $67 billion the largest-ever merger of pure tech companies. That move could be considered the opposite of what HP is doing.
"
1261,HPQ,"Many tech titans are scrambling to find ways to stay on their toes, but some observers question the strategy of HP and Chief Executive Meg Whitman. HP executives were unavailable for comment.
"
1262,HPQ,"Rob Enderle, a longtime Silicon Valley analyst, is among the dubious. He points to Dell and China giant Lenovo as among companies that view offering a broad spectrum of technology as key.
"
1263,HPQ,"""HP seems to be an example of a company determined to do something wrong,"" Enderle said.
"
1264,HPQ,"Market Cap Vs. Sales
"
1265,HPQ,"Right or wrong, Hewlett Packard Enterprise is the ""new"" company that will aim to deepen technology's ties to corporations. It looks to make money providing services via the cloud or Internet. HP Inc. will focus on the consumer PC and printing businesses.
"
1266,HPQ,"One signpost by which to gauge the split's success is how it transforms HP's market capitalization. For now, HP is the only tech company of its size with a market cap smaller than its annual sales. Prior to the split, the combined HP was valued below $48 billion, while revenue for its fiscal year, which ended Saturday, is estimated near $106 billion. Prior to the split, there were roughly 1.8 billion shares of HP; its stock closed Friday at 26.96.
"
1267,HPQ,"By comparison, Apple's world-leading market cap of $683 billion compares with annual sales of $234 billion. IBM has less than 1 billion shares outstanding, roughly half of HP's; but its market cap is nearly triple HP's, at $136.4 billion, with its stock closing Friday just above 140. IBM posted 2014 sales of $93 billion.
"
1268,HPQ,"Oracle has roughly double the shares that HP has but more than triple the market cap: $166 billion, with annual sales near $38 billion. Cisco is roughly equal to Oracle, with $146 billion in market cap and $49 billion in sales this fiscal year.
"
1269,HPQ,"Ranking Low
"
1270,HPQ,"Excluding financial services firms, which don't record revenue, HP ranks No. 33 among multinational companies in the Financial Times Global 500 in terms of sales, but it ranks No. 125 in market cap.
"
1271,HPQ,"And HP ranks No. 111 in revenue per employee and No. 162 in market value per employee.
"
1272,HPQ,"""How the hell do you even get there?"" asked analyst Enderle of HP's standing. ""For the most part, it's being clueless.""
"
1273,HPQ,"But some — including Crawford Del Prete, an analyst at tech research firm IDC who has followed HP since the late 1990s — view the split as a solid move.
"
1274,HPQ,"""It's hard for me to be skeptical (about whether) it's going to work,"" Del Prete said. ""I don't see how they're going to have trouble executing the split.""
"
1275,HPQ,"FBR's Ives says that the key for HP is how well the enterprise unit adapts to cloud computing, a huge trend in the tech industry.
"
1276,HPQ,"""HP was late to the cloud,"" Ives said. ""A lot of these (older, legacy tech) companies miscalculated how quickly this shift would happen. I think these companies have hubris and are seeing through rose-colored glasses not only on the board but (in) the CEO seat as well.""Now that Hewlett-Packard has split in two, the question for the iconic technology giant and pioneer is whether its divide-and-conquer strategy will spark a rebound and accelerate growth.HP's efforts to revisit the heights that it reached during the dot-com boom 15 years ago have largely failed.

Others say that it's the only way for HP to keep from becoming a dinosaur. While such tech titans as Apple (AAPL) find success and blue skies in new businesses, others such as IBM (IBM), Oracle (ORCL) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) see clouds, as in cloud computing, as they gaze into their crystal balls.""HP is trying to figure out how to get off the innovation treadmill that's going 2 miles per hour,"" said Daniel Ives, a tech analyst at FBR & Co. ""It makes sense that they're willing to do something to shake up the status quo.""Dell Does OppositeInvestors gave a mixed greeting to the split stocks in their first day of trading Monday. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), which gets a new ticker, fell 1.6% to 14.49. But HP Inc. (HPQ), which retains the ticker Hewlett-Packard has used since it acquired Compaq, rose 13% to 13.83.Ives says the split-up isn't meant to reverse HP's oft-criticized 2001 purchase of then-giant PC firm Compaq Computer for $25 billion. Opinions on that deal vary, but observers note that other tech Goliaths are trying the same method to keep from being slain by Davids. Most notably of late, privately held Dell announced an agreement in October to acquire EMC (EMC), at $67 billion the largest-ever merger of pure tech companies. That move could be considered the opposite of what HP is doing.Many tech titans are scrambling to find ways to stay on their toes, but some observers question the strategy of HP and Chief Executive Meg Whitman. HP executives were unavailable for comment.Rob Enderle, a longtime Silicon Valley analyst, is among the dubious. He points to Dell and China giant Lenovo as among companies that view offering a broad spectrum of technology as key.""HP seems to be an example of a company determined to do something wrong,"" Enderle said.Market Cap Vs. SalesRight or wrong, Hewlett Packard Enterprise is the ""new"" company that will aim to deepen technology's ties to corporations. It looks to make money providing services via the cloud or Internet. HP Inc. will focus on the consumer PC and printing businesses.One signpost by which to gauge the split's success is how it transforms HP's market capitalization. For now, HP is the only tech company of its size with a market cap smaller than its annual sales. Prior to the split, the combined HP was valued below $48 billion, while revenue for its fiscal year, which ended Saturday, is estimated near $106 billion. Prior to the split, there were roughly 1.8 billion shares of HP; its stock closed Friday at 26.96.By comparison, Apple's world-leading market cap of $683 billion compares with annual sales of $234 billion. IBM has less than 1 billion shares outstanding, roughly half of HP's; but its market cap is nearly triple HP's, at $136.4 billion, with its stock closing Friday just above 140. IBM posted 2014 sales of $93 billion.Oracle has roughly double the shares that HP has but more than triple the market cap: $166 billion, with annual sales near $38 billion. Cisco is roughly equal to Oracle, with $146 billion in market cap and $49 billion in sales this fiscal year.Ranking LowExcluding financial services firms, which don't record revenue, HP ranks No. 33 among multinational companies in the Financial Times Global 500 in terms of sales, but it ranks No. 125 in market cap.And HP ranks No. 111 in revenue per employee and No. 162 in market value per employee.""How the hell do you even get there?"" asked analyst Enderle of HP's standing. ""For the most part, it's being clueless.""But some — including Crawford Del Prete, an analyst at tech research firm IDC who has followed HP since the late 1990s — view the split as a solid move.""It's hard for me to be skeptical (about whether) it's going to work,"" Del Prete said. ""I don't see how they're going to have trouble executing the split.""FBR's Ives says that the key for HP is how well the enterprise unit adapts to cloud computing, a huge trend in the tech industry.""HP was late to the cloud,"" Ives said. ""A lot of these (older, legacy tech) companies miscalculated how quickly this shift would happen. I think these companies have hubris and are seeing through rose-colored glasses not only on the board but (in) the CEO seat as well.""

1277,HPQ,"Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) stock gapped up more than 5% Wednesday after the tech giant announced plans to slash up to 30,000 jobs as part of a restructuring that will split it into two companies.

"
1278,HPQ,"Hewlett-Packard's (HPQ) enterprise unit will cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs from its work force as part of the restructuring as it separates from HP's consumer operations, company officials said Tuesday.HP made the announcement at a meeting with analysts and later disclosed the plan publicly in a press release. The tech giant now has 302,000 employees worldwide across all its operations, and would end up with as few as 272,000 as a result of the enterprise unit cutbacks. Company officials told analysts they may do some rehiring once the restructuring is complete.Further guidance on HP's consumer unit, known as HP Inc., was expected later in the day but sources didn't expect the company to announce further layoffs from that division, which formally separates from the enterprise operations Nov. 1.The enterprise unit's restructuring is expected to take out $2.7 billion in annual costs, company officials said in a press release. The costs associated with the restructuring will amount to a $2.7 billion GAAP charge, beginning in the fourth quarter, and the move will impact cash by $2.6 billion over the next three years, starting in fiscal 2016.""These restructuring activities will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,"" HP Chief Executive Meg Whitman said in a prepared statement. ""We've done a significant amount of work over the past few years to take costs out and simplify processes and these final actions will eliminate the need for any future corporate restructuring.""RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said in a research note late Tuesday that the ""expectation is that some of the savings will be invested back in the business and savings will be fully realized by fiscal-year 2017 to 2018 time frame.""The reductions come three years after HP slashed 55,000 jobs in 2012.HP also said it expects 2016 earnings, excluding items, of $1.85 to $1.95 a share for the enterprise unit. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters have been expecting $3.72 in adjusted income per share for both the consumer and enterprise divisions in 2016, 2.8% up from 2015's expected $3.62. Revenue for the combined entity, however, is expected to drop 1.6% to $102.4 billion.HP stock ended Tuesday's regular trading session in the stock market today up marginally to 27.11, but was trading down more than 2% after hours.

1357,HPQ,"Hewlett-Packard's road to revenue growth has hit another pothole.The computer products giant reported a mixed bag of fiscal fourth-quarter numbers late Tuesday as the company continues to work through a restructuring that will include splitting it into two separate entities by the end of next year.The company's Q4 sales missed analyst views, while its earnings for the quarter were merely in line.Hewlett-Packard's (HPQ) earnings forecast for the current quarter was lighter than expected.Shares fell about 1% in after-hours trading. HP stock ended the regular session up a fraction at 37.63.HP's revenue fell 2% year over year to $28.4 billion in the quarter ended Oct. 31. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected a 1.2% decline to $28.76 billion.HP reported earnings per share minus items of $1.06, up 5% from the year-earlier period and in line with analyst estimates.The company's 2% decline in revenue in Q4 failed to match the 1% year-over-year revenue growth in the prior quarter, which had been its first positive revenue gain in 11 quarters dating back to July 2011. HP's sales miss comes even as the company posted its fourth consecutive quarter with year-over-year revenue growth in its PC business.HP has been scrambling to move into newer areas such as cloud computing and Big Data to offset declining growth in its printing and other businesses.The company launched what is expected to be a five-year restructuring effort in May 2012.But HP's third-quarter growth was more of an anomaly than a new direction for the company — at least for now, says Brian White, an analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald.""When you look at the big picture of HP and you look at all of the different businesses, there is really not one market where you can say, 'That is going to take off in terms of revenue,'"" he told IBD. ""Whether it's services or the enterprise group, PCs or printers — none of them is really growing, or at least the markets are not growing at respectable rates.""For the current quarter, HP said it expects earnings per share of 89 to 93 cents, or a decline of 1.1% to an increase of 3.3%.Analysts had modeled for 93 cents EPS and revenue to decline by 2.1% to $27.55 billion. HP doesn't provide a revenue forecast.For the full year, HP said it expects EPS of $3.83 to $4.03, up 2.4% to 7.7%.Analysts have been expecting $3.94 EPS, or growth of 5.3%, and revenue of $110.35 billion, down 1%.During a conference call with analysts, HP CEO Meg Whitman expressed confidence in the company's direction.""Overall, I'm very pleased with the progress we have made,"" she said. ""On the top line, I have always said that turnarounds aren't linear and, while we are seeing clear pockets of growth, other areas still need more work. But overall our revenue performance has improved dramatically over the past three years.""HP will keep a sharp focus on its fundamental operations, she said, including its cost structure and supply chain.As in prior quarters, HP's line items reveal a company with more misses than hits.Revenue from the company's personal systems group, which is mostly PCs, increased 4% year over year to $8.94 billion.Sales of notebooks increased 9% to $4.86 billion while desktops decreased 3% to $3.18 billion.Printing revenue declined 5% to $5.74 billion.Sales of supplies slipped 7% to $3.59 billion.HP stock is up 35% year to date through Tuesday's close. Investors might be buying into the promise that HP can carve a niche in the growing 3D printing market after it announced the development of a product last month that is expected to be ready for sale in 2016, White says.""The 3D dream helps the perception around the stock,"" he said. ""The market does believe in 3D printing, and they are definitely a leader in printing.""Revenue from HP's enterprise group, including servers, storage and networking systems, declined 4% to $7.27 billion.Sales of industry standard servers fell 2% to $3.37 billion.Technology services revenue decreased 3% to $2.11 billion.Enterprise services revenue declined 7% to $5.51 billion.Sales of infrastructure technology outsourcing fell 7% to $3.44 billion, while revenue from application and business services fell 6% to $2.06 billion.HP will need more than just a resurging PC business to reaccelerate its growth, White says.""It comes back to (the question): Is this portfolio positioned for Big Data, cloud, Internet of Things, things that are major trends?"" he said. ""I don't think it's as well positioned as other companies.""Even though HP plans to split the company into two separate companies, the challenge for the company doesn't end there, says Rohit Mehra, an analyst for IDC.""The bigger challenge is for the personal systems side as well as the enterprise side to actually show the market that they have entered a period where they can show sustained growth,"" he told IBD.

1386,HPQ,"Polycom (PLCM) stock retreated Friday, a day after activist investor Elliott Management disclosed it had a major stake in the videoconferencing company and called on its board to merge with a wireless telecom provider.Shares of Polycom, whose top rivals include heavyweights Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), were down 4% in early afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 12.80. But this comes after a 17% jump Thursday to a four-month high above 13.Elliott Management sent a letter Thursday to San Jose, Calif.-based Polycom, noting it had a 6.6% stake in the company, as well as a major stake in Mitel Networks (MITL), a Canadian wireless provider. All told, New York-based Elliott says it has roughly $100 million invested in each of the companies.In its letter, Elliott called for Polycom to undertake a full strategic review and to consider buying Mitel. Mitel stock, which rose 16.5% Thursday to a two-month high, was up a fraction early Friday afternoon, near 8.20.""Maintaining the status quo strategy will perpetuate Polycom's track record of underperformance and risk further shareholder value erosion,"" Elliott's letter said. ""In the last two years, Polycom has already responded by cutting costs, buying back stock and changing management, none of which has generated value to stockholders. Polycom must initiate a comprehensive review of all strategic options, and the time for that review is now.""Polycom stock has traded between 9.99 and 14.22 for two years.Mitel and Polycom both declined to comment on the prospect of a deal.""Polycom's board and management regularly review and evaluate the company's strategy as part of our commitment to enhance shareholder value,"" Polycom said in a prepared statement. ""We maintain an ongoing dialogue with our shareholders, and we will be meeting with Elliott's representatives to discuss their thoughts. It is our policy, however, not to comment on our discussions with shareholders.""William Blair & Co. analyst Jason Ader isn't sure a Polycom-Mitel marriage is the best idea, though he agrees Polycom needs a shake-up. Polycom has been trying to challenge industry leader Cisco in videoconferencing.""While we agree with Elliott's premise that the status quo at Polycom is untenable, after reviewing the details of proposal, we are not as optimistic about the potential of a combined Polycom-Mitel entity to drive shareholder value,"" Ader said in a research note Friday. ""Our principal concerns are the lack of substantial cost synergies between Mitel's voice-oriented and Polycom's video-centric products, as well as what we view as overly optimistic Street expectations for Polycom's top-line growth in 2016.""Elliott Management has also gotten in the thick of another boardroom issue, calling for data storage giant EMC (EMC) to sell its 80% stake in VMware (VMW).

1422,HPQ,"Deep in transition, IBM showed its 14th quarter in a row of year-over-year declining revenue, as the company reported third-quarter earnings after the market close Monday. IBM (IBM) logged earnings per share minus items of $3.34, down 9% from the year-ago period but beating the consensus estimate of $3.30, as polled by Thomson Reuters.Revenue from continuing operations came in at $19.3 billion, down 14%. IBM said adjusting for currency and divested business, revenue fell 1%. Currency fluctuations clipped revenue by $1.9 billion.Foreign currency exchange woes have battered earnings, as IBM gets about two-thirds of its revenue from outside the U.S. IBM has estimated that currency headwinds and divestiture will cut approximately 80 cents off its EPS for 2015.IBM lowered full-year EPS minus items to a range of $14.75 to $15.75, vs. previous guidance of $15.75-$16.50. The midpoint for its updated guidance, $15.25, is below the consensus estimate of $15.68.IBM stock slipped 0.8% during the regular trading session Monday and was down 5%, near 141.85, in after-hours trading. That reflects a decline of about 18% since the company last reported earnings on July 20, beating earnings estimates but missing on revenue.IBM has long been in transition, shedding hardware units and realigning its workforce to cut costs as it focuses on growth areas such as cloud computing, data analytics, mobile computing and security — what it refers to as strategic imperatives.Revenue from strategic imperatives rose 17% from a year earlier (27% adjusting for currency and divested business). It is up 20% year-to-date (30% adjusting for currency and divested business), IBM said.IBM said revenue from its cloud computing business rose 45% (65% after currency and divestiture adjustments). In the trailing 12-month period, cloud revenue totaled $9.4 billion.""We've always said our transformation would take time and the transition wouldn't be a straight line,"" said Martin Schroeter, IBM chief financial officer, in a call with reporters after earnings posted. ""We've maintained high levels of investments because we are seeing our strategy is correct and we are getting the returns and growth.""IBM is not alone among tech giants that are transitioning to more advanced business models.""As we have seen with IBM and many of its mature tech brethren (Oracle (ORCL), EMC (EMC), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Cisco (CSCO) over the past year, growth has been agonizing to come by as these large traditional IT vendors face an Everest-like climb in their quest for success in this ever changing IT landscape,"" FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a research note prior to IBM earnings.An example of that is the $67 billion Dell will pay to acquire data-storage giant EMC.""These once almighty stalwarts are now scratching their heads trying to figure out the path (or exit strategy) for a renaissance of growth around cloud, big data, cybersecurity, and IoT (Internet of Things),"" Ives wrote.Schroeter said IBM has invested over $10 billion in research and development, capital expenditures and acquisitions in the past year.This month, IBM acquired Merge Healthcare, a provider of medical image processing technology, for $1 billion. It will become part of IBM's new Watson Health business unit. IBM also launched a new business unit called IBM Cognitive Business Solutions, based on its Watson computer.IBM said revenue from the Americas fell 10% to $9.1 billion, down 3% adjusting for currency fluctuations and divestitures.

1425,HPQ,"Personal computer and tablet owners are holding on to their current devices longer, putting a crimp on sales of new devices, market research firm Gartner said Wednesday.Gartner predicts that shipments of personal computers will fall 7.3% to 291 million units worldwide this year. It sees no change in PC shipments in 2016 and a 4.1% increase to 303 million units in 2017.Gartner forecasts shipments of tablets and convertible devices to fall 11.9% to 199 million in 2015. It predicts shipments in the category will increase to 208 units in 2016 and 218 million in 2017.Mobile phone shipments are seen topping 1.9 billion units in 2015, up 1.4%, and 1.96 billion in 2016. Gartner projects that mobile phone shipments in 2017 will hit 2 billion units, with smartphones accounting for 89% of the total.Combined PC, tablet and mobile phone shipments will decline 1% this year because PC and tablet owners are experiencing ""replacement indecision,"" Gartner said in a press release.""Replacement activity across all types of devices has decreased,"" Gartner analyst Ranjit Atwal said in the release. ""Users are extending the lifetime of their devices, or deciding not to replace their devices at all.""The launch of Microsoft's (MSFT) Windows 10 operating system has failed to reverse declining PC sales, Gartner noted. But PC sales should return to growth in 2017, thanks to business orders, it said.Sales of tablets like Apple's (AAPL) iPad also have been hurt by longer replacement cycles, the researcher said. Also, a Gartner survey of 19,000 consumers in the U.S., U.K., France, China, Brazil and India found that 44% of current tablet users are planning to substitute their tablets with a different device, such as a smartphone.Rival research firm IDC said it expects the current downturn in PC shipments to last five years.Last month, PC maker Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) said it expects PC sales to remain weak through early 2016.

1428,HPQ,"2014 saw the fewest planned job cuts since 1997, according to placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Layoffs announced in December were down 9.2% from November, the second straight month of declines, and took 2014 totals 5.0% below those notched in 2013.Fewer layoffs are good news for job seekers, Challenger said, because they ""will not only find more employment opportunities in 2015 but will enjoy increased job security once they are in those new positions.""Challenger's figures point to not only a firming job market but also one with more churn. The two industries with the greatest number of layoffs were computer and retail. Both, Challenger acknowledged, are benefiting from the economic expansion.The computer industry saw a 69% jump in layoffs last year to 59,528. But much of that downsizing came thanks to efforts by Microsoft (MSFT) and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) to compete better with more streamlined operations.Lower oil prices might help the overall economy but could lead to layoffs this year in the energy and energy-related fields. U.S. Steel (X) said this month that it would shut a plant that makes specialized pipes for the energy industry, cutting 768 jobs.Coca-Cola (KO) said Thursday it will cut 1,600-1,800 jobs as part of a previously announced $3 billion cost-cutting plan amid stalling soda sales. Caterpillar (CAT) said Wednesday it will 200 jobs, mostly related to mining equipment, which has struggled as low commodity prices and demand hit mining.Those three companies' job cut announcements will show up in Challenger's January report.The Labor Department releases its December employment report on Friday morning.

""However, we think the market is real and could be about $20 billion in 2020.""Sales in the 3D printer market this year are estimated to come in at about $5 billion.Stratasys and 3D Systems are the two largest providers of 3D printers. The stock of both companies soared from early 2012 through early 2014. Then the stocks fell, on the reality that the industry had many mountains yet to climb.""We think 3D printing is a significant long-term opportunity, but the technology is immature in terms of speed, quality and reliability, which has caused problems for Stratasys and 3D Systems,"" Milunovich wrote.He says that HP has solved bottlenecks holding back 3D printing, such as speed.It is ""entirely believable that HP could become the leading 3D printing company,"" due to its current strength as a printing vendor, he wrote.""Our view is that 3D printing is in the early innings of commercial implementation, with the industrial greater than the consumer opportunity,"" Milunovich wrote. ""3D printing lacks economies of scale today for most applications.

"
1439,HPQ,"The pressures that have slowed tech growth this year will show up again when Q3 earnings season begins in earnest on Tuesday, when chip leader Intel (INTC) reports.
"
1440,HPQ,"The consensus estimate for the 68 tech companies in the S&P 500 is for earnings-per-share growth to average just 2.4% from the year-earlier quarter. That's despite an expected huge quarter of 32% EPS growth from the biggest company of all, Apple (AAPL).
"
1441,HPQ,"Tech companies have long been the innovation trendsetters, turning in strong earnings reports that most often put the industry at or near the top of the best-performing groups in the S&P 500. At least, that's how it had been. But the 2.4% average EPS growth outlook for Q3 would mark the sector's worst performance since Q2 2013, according to data collected by Thomson Reuters.
"
1442,HPQ,"And if Apple is taken out of the equation, then average tech EPS would be expected to fall by 3.4%.
"
1443,HPQ,"For the S&P 500 as a whole, analyst consensus estimates call for earnings per share, typically minus items such as stock options, to fall 4.5%. That drop is largely due to the ailing energy sector, which is expected to see EPS tumble 26%. Excluding the energy section, EPS is expected to rise 2% overall for the S&P 500.
"
1444,HPQ,"As has been the case all year, a weak global economy, strong dollar, slow PC sales and the seismic shift to cloud computing continue to weigh on the tech sector.
"
1445,HPQ,"""The tech industry is no longer one of the consistent leaders each quarter, but it's expected to improve going into next year,"" said Gregory Harrison, earnings analyst at Thomson Reuters.
"
1446,HPQ,"But first, the outlook is expected to get worse before it gets better. For Q4, the consensus tech EPS estimate is for a slight decline of 0.3%. That's expected to improve to growth of 6.7% in Q1 2016 and 8.8% in Q2.
"
1447,HPQ,"Optimism Vs. Reality
"
1448,HPQ,"Analysts, it should be noted, tend to be more optimistic the further out they look. At the start of this year, for example, the consensus Q3 tech EPS estimate was for growth of 12%. That Q3 consensus forecast fell to 9.4% in April and 6% in July, before hitting the current 2.4%.
"
1449,HPQ,"""Optimism goes away when reality begins coming into view,"" said Harrison.
"
1450,HPQ,"Bill Whyman, an analyst at Evercore ISI, does expect things to improve in 2016, but he says improvements will be weighted more toward the second half. Whyman gave his tech outlook in a conference call with investors on Oct. 5.
"
1451,HPQ,"What's missing now, Whyman says, is a powerful tech product cycle or a better economy, neither of which have come into view.
"
1452,HPQ,"""We're still stuck in a low-growth world,"" Whyman said on the call.
"
1453,HPQ,"Part of what's ailing many big tech companies is what Whyman says is a once-in-a-decade secular shift — the move to cloud computing, which has shattered old ways of using technology. Rather than buy large computer servers and storage systems for business operations, companies and other enterprises are lowering costs by instead turning to cloud-computing services from such companies as Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL), the new parent company of Google.
"
1454,HPQ,"Moreover, many providers of cloud services are buying lower-cost hardware from China and Taiwan in order to cut their costs. That trends has hurt hardware vendors such as IBM (IBM), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and EMC (EMC).
"
1455,HPQ,"IBM is slated to report Q3 earnings after the market close Oct. 19. Big Blue, which has sold several businesses as it restructures, has posted 13 straight quarters of year-over-year declines in revenue. The 14th straight quarter is likely ahead, as IBM is expected to report a 12% drop in sales, to $19.65 billion. EPS is expected to fall 9% to $3.34.
"
1456,HPQ,"Cloud computing has spurred the growth of software-as-a-service business models, pioneered by companies like Salesforce.com (CRM). The SaaS model has enabled customers to pay only for what they use, instead of handing over hefty fees for some services they don't need. The SaaS model has been disruptive to old-line software makers like Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP). This disruption is happening amid slower sales of PCs, smartphones and tablets.
"
1457,HPQ,"PC Problem Continues
"
1458,HPQ,"Research firm Gartner on Thursday said PC shipments fell 7.7% year over year in Q3, to 73.7 million units. That's an improvement from a 9.5% decline in Q2, but the Windows 10 operating system that Microsoft launched in Q3 had ""minimal impact"" on Q3 shipments, Gartner said.
"
1459,HPQ,"That's a challenge for No. 1 PC-processor maker Intel. After the close Tuesday, Intel is expected to post an EPS drop of 11%. Revenue is expected to rise a slim 2% to $14.2 billion, after a 5% decline in Q2.
"
1460,HPQ,"Among the sub-sectors in the S&P 500 tech group, the application software group leads the field, with an expected average EPS increase of 40%. Adobe Systems (ADBE) last week showed a 93% EPS increase when it reported earnings for its fiscal Q3 ended Aug. 28. But the software company forecast fiscal 2016 sales and profit below Wall Street estimates, and the stock sank more than 5%.
"
1461,HPQ,"The Internet software and services group, a strong performer all year, is expected to post a relatively modest EPS growth of 6%. This group includes Facebook (FB), Google, Yahoo (YHOO) and eBay (EBAY). Yahoo, which reports earnings on Oct. 20 after the close, hurt the sector. Yahoo's Q3 EPS is expected to fall 67% to 17 cents, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Without Yahoo, EPS growth for the group is 13%.
"
1462,HPQ,"Following Yahoo, Microsoft and Google both report after the close Oct. 22.

1465,HPQ,"Follow Brian Deagon on Twitter @IBD_BDeagon.The pressures that have slowed tech growth this year will show up again when Q3 earnings season begins in earnest on Tuesday, when chip leader Intel (INTC) reports.The consensus estimate for the 68 tech companies in the S&P 500 is for earnings-per-share growth to average just 2.4% from the year-earlier quarter. That's despite an expected huge quarter of 32% EPS growth from the biggest company of all, Apple (AAPL).Tech companies have long been the innovation trendsetters, turning in strong earnings reports that most often put the industry at or near the top of the best-performing groups in the S&P 500. At least, that's how it had been. But the 2.4% average EPS growth outlook for Q3 would mark the sector's worst performance since Q2 2013, according to data collected by Thomson Reuters.And if Apple is taken out of the equation, then average tech EPS would be expected to fall by 3.4%.For the S&P 500 as a whole, analyst consensus estimates call for earnings per share, typically minus items such as stock options, to fall 4.5%. That drop is largely due to the ailing energy sector, which is expected to see EPS tumble 26%. Excluding the energy section, EPS is expected to rise 2% overall for the S&P 500.As has been the case all year, a weak global economy, strong dollar, slow PC sales and the seismic shift to cloud computing continue to weigh on the tech sector.""The tech industry is no longer one of the consistent leaders each quarter, but it's expected to improve going into next year,"" said Gregory Harrison, earnings analyst at Thomson Reuters.But first, the outlook is expected to get worse before it gets better. For Q4, the consensus tech EPS estimate is for a slight decline of 0.3%. That's expected to improve to growth of 6.7% in Q1 2016 and 8.8% in Q2.Optimism Vs. RealityAnalysts, it should be noted, tend to be more optimistic the further out they look. At the start of this year, for example, the consensus Q3 tech EPS estimate was for growth of 12%. That Q3 consensus forecast fell to 9.4% in April and 6% in July, before hitting the current 2.4%.""Optimism goes away when reality begins coming into view,"" said Harrison.Bill Whyman, an analyst at Evercore ISI, does expect things to improve in 2016, but he says improvements will be weighted more toward the second half. Whyman gave his tech outlook in a conference call with investors on Oct. 5.What's missing now, Whyman says, is a powerful tech product cycle or a better economy, neither of which have come into view.""We're still stuck in a low-growth world,"" Whyman said on the call.Part of what's ailing many big tech companies is what Whyman says is a once-in-a-decade secular shift — the move to cloud computing, which has shattered old ways of using technology. Rather than buy large computer servers and storage systems for business operations, companies and other enterprises are lowering costs by instead turning to cloud-computing services from such companies as Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL), the new parent company of Google.Moreover, many providers of cloud services are buying lower-cost hardware from China and Taiwan in order to cut their costs. That trends has hurt hardware vendors such as IBM (IBM), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and EMC (EMC).IBM is slated to report Q3 earnings after the market close Oct. 19. Big Blue, which has sold several businesses as it restructures, has posted 13 straight quarters of year-over-year declines in revenue. The 14th straight quarter is likely ahead, as IBM is expected to report a 12% drop in sales, to $19.65 billion. EPS is expected to fall 9% to $3.34.Cloud computing has spurred the growth of software-as-a-service business models, pioneered by companies like Salesforce.com (CRM). The SaaS model has enabled customers to pay only for what they use, instead of handing over hefty fees for some services they don't need. The SaaS model has been disruptive to old-line software makers like Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP). This disruption is happening amid slower sales of PCs, smartphones and tablets.PC Problem ContinuesResearch firm Gartner on Thursday said PC shipments fell 7.7% year over year in Q3, to 73.7 million units. That's an improvement from a 9.5% decline in Q2, but the Windows 10 operating system that Microsoft launched in Q3 had ""minimal impact"" on Q3 shipments, Gartner said.That's a challenge for No. 1 PC-processor maker Intel. After the close Tuesday, Intel is expected to post an EPS drop of 11%. Revenue is expected to rise a slim 2% to $14.2 billion, after a 5% decline in Q2.Among the sub-sectors in the S&P 500 tech group, the application software group leads the field, with an expected average EPS increase of 40%. Adobe Systems (ADBE) last week showed a 93% EPS increase when it reported earnings for its fiscal Q3 ended Aug. 28. But the software company forecast fiscal 2016 sales and profit below Wall Street estimates, and the stock sank more than 5%.The Internet software and services group, a strong performer all year, is expected to post a relatively modest EPS growth of 6%. This group includes Facebook (FB), Google, Yahoo (YHOO) and eBay (EBAY). Yahoo, which reports earnings on Oct. 20 after the close, hurt the sector. Yahoo's Q3 EPS is expected to fall 67% to 17 cents, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Without Yahoo, EPS growth for the group is 13%.Following Yahoo, Microsoft and Google both report after the close Oct. 22.Microsoft, which is restructuring, is expected to report EPS ex items of 58 cents, down 11%. Google is expected to show EPS of $7.20, up 13%.Apple reports after the close Oct. 27. Overall smartphone growth is slowing, but not at Apple. Earnings are expected to jump 32% to $1.88, its seventh quarter in a row of double-digit gains Revenue is expected to top $51 billion, up 21%.Follow Brian Deagon on Twitter @IBD_BDeagon.

Miller confirmed that InBev informed the company that it intended to make an offer, but that no specific terms had been received.The combination would create, by a wide margin, the world's largest brauhaus, with combined revenue of just under $70 billion in 2014. On the London Stock Exchange, Miller shares spiked 20%. The news also stirred some sympathy moves in the beer trade, the most significant of which was a 13% premarket spike by Molson Coors Brewing (TAP).Shares of Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) barely budged after the company announced late Tuesday it would carve 30,000 workers from its payroll . The cuts will come from Hewlett's enterprise unit, which is preparing to separate from the consumer operations side of the business, and follow the company's cutback of 55,000 workers in 2012.FedEx (FDX) dropped nearly 3% after its fiscal first-quarter earnings rose 15%, shy of consensus projections for a 17% gain. Revenue growth of 5% met expectations. Management lowered its full-year EPS guidance, citing ""weaker-than-expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."" FedEx shares have been consolidating since June.Among drugmakers, biotech Intra-Cellular Therapies (ITCI) spiked 50% on positive results from a phase three trial of its schizophrenia treatment ITI-007. Xencor (XNCR) vaulted 25% after announcing a strategic partnership with Amgen (AMGN) to develop treatment in cancer immunotherapy and inflammation.Among leaders, Paycom Software (PAYC) dropped more than 5% before the open. The provider of cloud-based, human-resource management software announced late Tuesday a secondary offering of 4.5 million shares of common stock by shareholders. The stock ended Tuesday 3% above a June buy point of 39.27 after struggling to recover from a deep July slide.

1539,HPQ,"ARLINGTON, Va. — The Defense Department is making a big push to attract companies in Silicon Valley like Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB), but venture capital firms are warning fledgling companies to stay away, said an Air Force acquisition official.The number one reason why tech firms are leery of working with the Pentagon is overseas trading restrictions, Camron Gorguinpour, the director of transformational innovation for the Air Force, told IBD.Many tech firms are worried that if they do DOD work, they won't be able to sell their technology overseas or will have to jump though several hoops before getting permission — issues that traditional defense contractors like Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) face.But the Pentagon is looking at ways to relax some restrictions as it hopes to build better relationships with Silicon Valley, Gorguinpour said in an interview at an Air Force Association event.Lockheed shares climbed 1% to close at 204.76 in the stock market today. Northrop shares dipped 0.4% to 166.78. Apple shares rose 0.6% to end the day at 115.00. Facebook shares edged up 0.5% to 94.41.Silicon Valley and the Pentagon have been at odds recently, especially after Edward Snowden's leaks pertaining to government surveillance.Those strains added to the already vast cultural differences between the two sectors — the slow moving, rigid, formal Pentagon and the rapidly developing, informal, creative tech firms.The Pentagon has tried to bridge the divide by opening an office in Silicon Valley as it looks to beef up its cybersecurity and build advanced weapons more quickly.Last month, Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced funding for the Flexible Hybrid Electronic Institute in San Jose, Calif., led by the FlexTech Alliance. It's a consortium of 162 companies, universities and nonprofits that includes Apple, Applied Materials (AMAT), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Boeing (BA), Lockheed, and General Motors (GM).He also visited LinkedIn's (LNKD) headquarters to find out how the Pentagon can compete for new employees in tech. In an earlier trip to Silicon Valley, Carter met with Facebook officials.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter @IBD_GRich.

1575,HPQ,"Now that Carly Fiorina has gained some steam in her longshot bid for the Republican presidential nomination, more questions are surfacing about what she did — or failed to do — as CEO of Hewlett-Packard.
"
1576,HPQ,"Fiorina left the tech giant more than a decade ago, but her controversial five-year-plus tenure leading the tech giant is her biggest claim to fame as voters try to assess her abilities.
"
1577,HPQ,"The 60-year-old Fiorina has been relatively inactive since she was dismissed by the Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) board in February 2005, so her time at HP gets scrutiny as a barometer of her leadership capabilities.
"
1578,HPQ,"Fiorina touts her HP experience as proof that she can deal with complex issues. And like Republican rival Donald Trump, Fiorina says her outsider status as a non-career politician with business sensibilities will bring a fresh outlook to the White House.
"
1579,HPQ,"Just how good Fiorina was as CEO is a question with a lot of answers. Fiorina herself declined to comment for this story.
"
1580,HPQ,"The highlight, or lowlight, of her HP days was pushing through a contentious acquisition of Compaq Computer, which made HP the No. 1 maker of PCs. (It's now No. 2, behind China's Lenovo.) The acquisition came with public fights with members of the Packard and Hewlett families, and the subsequent layoffs earned Fiorina the enmity of many former and current HP employees.
"
1581,HPQ,"Others, though, consider the Compaq deal a big win for HP.
"
1582,HPQ,"""I think she's gotten a bad rap,"" said Robert Wayman, HP's longtime CFO, who served under Fiorina and took over as interim CEO after she left. ""More analysis would lead you to a different conclusion than she was just a failure. I do not think she was a failure.""
"
1583,HPQ,"Others say Fiorina's tenure as the first female chief executive of a Fortune 20 company was too full of potholes to be deemed a success.
"
1584,HPQ,"Besides the awkward merger with Compaq, HP's stock flailed and the company's vaunted culture deteriorated, many say.
"
1585,HPQ,"""I believe that if you're not some ISIS mass murderer, you're probably entitled to a second beginning,"" Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, told IBD. ""But she's done nothing to (deserve) that redemption, other than wanting to be commander in chief.""
"
1586,HPQ,"Sonnenfeld recently wrote a piece for Fortune magazine examining Fiorina's qualifications.
"
1587,HPQ,"After leaving HP, Fiorina made an unsuccessful bid for a California U.S. Senate seat in 2010, sat on several boards and served as a commentator on Fox News.
"
1588,HPQ,"Fiorina was a surprise choice as HP CEO in 1999, to replace the retiring Lewis Platt. Fiorina had been running a division for Lucent Technologies, now Alcatel-Lucent (ALU).
"
1589,HPQ,"She not only broke the glass ceiling at HP but was the first outsider hired to run the pioneering Silicon Valley stalwart, which was founded in a garage in 1939 by William Hewlett and David Packard.
"
1590,HPQ,"The founders' vaunted principles, known as ""The HP Way,"" fostered a collaborative and collegial atmosphere. Longtime HPers were mistrustful of outsider Fiorina, who responded by ... not cleaning house.
"
1591,HPQ,"""Everyone thought I was going to be dismissed, that she would bring in her own team,"" Wayman said. ""That just didn't happen.""
"
1592,HPQ,"One former HP executive from that period, who spoke only if not identified, said Fiorina violated the company's culture by laying off a few thousand employees within her first couple of years. While HP had made some employee buyouts in its past, these were its first involuntary layoffs.
"
1593,HPQ,"The layoffs upset many employees, the executive said, but the big trauma for HP came in September 2001, about a week before the 9/11 attacks. Fiorina announced that the company would acquire Compaq for about $24 billion.
"
1594,HPQ,"It was the defining moment in Fiorina's tenure, and the merger continues to be debated today.
"
1595,HPQ,"Compaq led in PCs and was big in servers. But competition was fierce, and the timing hurt, with the deal coming amid the economic downturn sparked by 9/11. Detractors say HP was too late in making the move, with PCs fast becoming commodities.
"
1596,HPQ,"Detractors say Fiorina mainly wanted to put her stamp on the company, instead of pursuing a strategy. Fiorina had failed months earlier to acquire a company in a completely different field, PricewaterhouseCoopers' management and tech consulting practice.
"

"
1598,HPQ,"The deal would result in roughly 15,000 people at the combined company losing their jobs because of overlap. The shareholder vote was close, with opposition led by sons of HP's co-founders, Walter Hewlett, who was then on HP's board, and David Woodley Packard.

1602,HPQ,"Fiorina wasn't looking to simply boost PC sales, the executive said. She wanted to make HP the leader in servers and a number of other product lines, able to trump the likes of IBM (IBM) and Dell.

1603,HPQ,"""Dell was taking over the world — of PCs in particular, but they were also moving into servers,"" said Wayman. ""This merger changed that. It absolutely did.""

"
1606,HPQ,"Many investors didn't see the value in the Compaq deal. Two months after the May 2002 acquisition, HP's stock reached its lowest point in the Fiorina years, falling to 10.75, down 84% from its all-time high of 68.09 hit in July 2000, at the end of the dot-com bubble.
"
1607,HPQ,"Detractors note that HP's stock underperformed IBM and Dell during Fiorina's tenure. HP stock lost about half its value from July 1999 through February 2005, vs. about 30% for IBM and just more than 3% for Dell.
"
1608,HPQ,"But Dell soon had its own growth problems. When Dell turned private in October 2013, its shares were down nearly 80% from its dot-com era high. At that point, HP was off 63% from its high.
"
1609,HPQ,"IBM's stock has done better. But HP did what might have been unthinkable in the 1990s and eclipsed Big Blue on the top line. HP continues to be bigger than IBM in revenue, though it trails far behind in market cap.Now that Carly Fiorina has gained some steam in her longshot bid for the Republican presidential nomination, more questions are surfacing about what she did — or failed to do — as CEO of Hewlett-Packard.Fiorina left the tech giant more than a decade ago, but her controversial five-year-plus tenure leading the tech giant is her biggest claim to fame as voters try to assess her abilities.The 60-year-old Fiorina has been relatively inactive since she was dismissed by the Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) board in February 2005, so her time at HP gets scrutiny as a barometer of her leadership capabilities.Fiorina touts her HP experience as proof that she can deal with complex issues. And like Republican rival Donald Trump, Fiorina says her outsider status as a non-career politician with business sensibilities will bring a fresh outlook to the White House.Just how good Fiorina was as CEO is a question with a lot of answers. Fiorina herself declined to comment for this story.The highlight, or lowlight, of her HP days was pushing through a contentious acquisition of Compaq Computer, which made HP the No. 1 maker of PCs. (It's now No. 2, behind China's Lenovo.) The acquisition came with public fights with members of the Packard and Hewlett families, and the subsequent layoffs earned Fiorina the enmity of many former and current HP employees.Others, though, consider the Compaq deal a big win for HP.""I think she's gotten a bad rap,"" said Robert Wayman, HP's longtime CFO, who served under Fiorina and took over as interim CEO after she left. ""More analysis would lead you to a different conclusion than she was just a failure. I do not think she was a failure.""Others say Fiorina's tenure as the first female chief executive of a Fortune 20 company was too full of potholes to be deemed a success.Besides the awkward merger with Compaq, HP's stock flailed and the company's vaunted culture deteriorated, many say.""I believe that if you're not some ISIS mass murderer, you're probably entitled to a second beginning,"" Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, told IBD. ""But she's done nothing to (deserve) that redemption, other than wanting to be commander in chief.""Sonnenfeld recently wrote a piece for Fortune magazine examining Fiorina's qualifications.After leaving HP, Fiorina made an unsuccessful bid for a California U.S. Senate seat in 2010, sat on several boards and served as a commentator on Fox News.Fiorina was a surprise choice as HP CEO in 1999, to replace the retiring Lewis Platt. Fiorina had been running a division for Lucent Technologies, now Alcatel-Lucent (ALU).She not only broke the glass ceiling at HP but was the first outsider hired to run the pioneering Silicon Valley stalwart, which was founded in a garage in 1939 by William Hewlett and David Packard.The founders' vaunted principles, known as ""The HP Way,"" fostered a collaborative and collegial atmosphere. Longtime HPers were mistrustful of outsider Fiorina, who responded by ... not cleaning house.""Everyone thought I was going to be dismissed, that she would bring in her own team,"" Wayman said. ""That just didn't happen.""One former HP executive from that period, who spoke only if not identified, said Fiorina violated the company's culture by laying off a few thousand employees within her first couple of years. While HP had made some employee buyouts in its past, these were its first involuntary layoffs.The layoffs upset many employees, the executive said, but the big trauma for HP came in September 2001, about a week before the 9/11 attacks. Fiorina announced that the company would acquire Compaq for about $24 billion.It was the defining moment in Fiorina's tenure, and the merger continues to be debated today.Compaq led in PCs and was big in servers. But competition was fierce, and the timing hurt, with the deal coming amid the economic downturn sparked by 9/11. Detractors say HP was too late in making the move, with PCs fast becoming commodities.Detractors say Fiorina mainly wanted to put her stamp on the company, instead of pursuing a strategy. Fiorina had failed months earlier to acquire a company in a completely different field, PricewaterhouseCoopers' management and tech consulting practice.""It was a bad move,"" said Yale's Sonnenfeld of the Compaq deal.The deal would result in roughly 15,000 people at the combined company losing their jobs because of overlap. The shareholder vote was close, with opposition led by sons of HP's co-founders, Walter Hewlett, who was then on HP's board, and David Woodley Packard.Wayman says he warmed to the merger.""It took me two to three weeks to really study what it might mean to us,"" he said.

1610,HPQ,"Despite the launch of Microsoft's (MSFT) well-received Windows 10 operating system, personal computer shipments are expected to fall by 8.7% this year and won't return to growth until 2017.That's the assessment of market research firm IDC, which put out its latest worldwide PC shipment forecast on Wednesday.IDC says the PC market will see five years of declining shipments before returning to growth. The commercial market will fuel the recovery, the research group said. Meanwhile, consumer PC sales will continue to decline through at least the end of 2019.Global PC sales this year have been hurt by the decline of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, IDC said.In addition to economic issues, sales channels are sitting on a ""stubbornly large inventory of notebooks from prior quarters,"" IDC said in a press release.Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) made note of this situation in its fiscal third-quarter earnings report last Thursday.Sales channels are reluctant to take Windows 10 machines because of the inventory backlog and the unfavorable PC sales outlook for the rest of the year.Since Microsoft is making Windows 10 available as a free upgrade for one year to owners of Windows 7 and Windows 8 PCs, many people don't have an incentive to buy a new PC.IDC foresees a modest recovery in 2017, with the prospect of the next PC refresh cycle and the end of free Windows 10 upgrades.""Although the shortcomings of the PC business are obvious, a silver lining is that the industry has continued to refine the more mobile aspects of personal computers — contributing to higher growth in convertible and ultra-slim notebooks,"" IDC analyst Jay Chou said in a statement. ""The de-emphasis of touch on Windows 10 also paves the way for a more familiar experience and continuing unit growth on large-screen systems, particularly all-in-one PCs.""Microsoft announced Wednesday that Windows 10 is now on over 75 million devices, in less than a month. Windows 10 was made available for download and sold with new PCs starting July 29.One category of PC that is selling well now are low-cost Chromebooks running Google's (GOOGL) Chrome OS.The NPD Group reported Wednesday that Chromebooks have seen a steep rise in popularity in the K-12 education market. Chromebooks in schools also are boosting sales of ""peripherals"" such as Wi-Fi access points and charging carts, NPD analyst Michael Diamond said in a blog post.Apple (AAPL) also has defied the PC sales slump with its Mac computers. Apple was the only top 5 PC vendor to show an increase in unit shipments in the second quarter, IDC said.

1641,HPQ,"Cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks handily beat Wall Street's Q4 earnings expectations late Wednesday, and its stock was up 5% after hours.
"
1642,HPQ,"For its fiscal Q4 ended July 31, Palo Alto Networks (PANW) reported $283.9 million in revenue and 28 cents in earnings per share minus items, up 59% and 155% vs. Q4 2014, respectively.
"
1643,HPQ,"Both bested Wall Street and the company's own estimates. And both metrics rose year over year by their biggest percentage rates of the fiscal year.
"
1644,HPQ,"The consensus of 33 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters called for sales of $256.4 million and EPS ex items of 25 cents.
"
1645,HPQ,"Three months ago, Palo Alto Networks guided to revenue of $252 million to $256 million and EPS ex items of 24 to 25 cents.
"
1646,HPQ,"Palo Alto's next-generation technology is replacing legacy systems, CEO Mark McLaughlin said in the firm's earnings conference call with analysts. As a result, ""we're seeing larger deals with larger customers ... and a continuation of customers buying more from us,"" he said.

"
1648,HPQ,"The company competes with network vendors such as Cisco Systems (CSCO), security software specialists such as Fortinet (FTNT) and Check Point Software (CHKP), and broad-based tech services providers that have targeted security, such as IBM (IBM) and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ).

1659,HPQ,"Palo Alto Networks stock fell a fraction in the regular session to 165.17, 18% below the company's record high of 200.55, achieved on July 24.Cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks handily beat Wall Street's Q4 earnings expectations late Wednesday, and its stock was up 5% after hours.For its fiscal Q4 ended July 31, Palo Alto Networks (PANW) reported $283.9 million in revenue and 28 cents in earnings per share minus items, up 59% and 155% vs. Q4 2014, respectively.Both bested Wall Street and the company's own estimates. And both metrics rose year over year by their biggest percentage rates of the fiscal year.The consensus of 33 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters called for sales of $256.4 million and EPS ex items of 25 cents.Three months ago, Palo Alto Networks guided to revenue of $252 million to $256 million and EPS ex items of 24 to 25 cents.Palo Alto's next-generation technology is replacing legacy systems, CEO Mark McLaughlin said in the firm's earnings conference call with analysts. As a result, ""we're seeing larger deals with larger customers ... and a continuation of customers buying more from us,"" he said.In Q4, the firm's customer base grew 35% vs. the year-earlier quarter, he said, and it rose 130% for Wildfire, the company's cloud-based malware analysis system.The company competes with network vendors such as Cisco Systems (CSCO), security software specialists such as Fortinet (FTNT) and Check Point Software (CHKP), and broad-based tech services providers that have targeted security, such as IBM (IBM) and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ).In Q4, per-device subscriptions rose to 2.2 from 2.1 in the year-earlier quarter, CFO Steffan Tomlinson said.""Customers have begun to realize they can't enact effective cybersecurity by cobbling together disparate products or legacy solutions,"" McLaughlin said.For fiscal 2015, Palo Alto Networks' revenue rose 55% to $928.1 million, topping its 51% growth for fiscal 2014.For the current fiscal Q1, the company expects EPS ex items of 31 cents to 32 cents, more than double the year-earlier figure, where analysts had modeled 31 cents. The company expects revenue of $280 million to $284 million, up 46% to 48%, vs. the $269.7 million analyst estimate.In 2016, Palo Alto Networks plans to debut Auto Focus and Aperture, McLaughlin said. Auto Focus gives customers access to threat intelligence, while Aperture, based on technology from newly acquired CirroSecure, provides software-as-a-service protections.McLaughlin says the company's new Traps product, which provides endpoint protection, is gaining traction. Traps has about 150 customers, he says.""We have customers who've bought Traps from us as their first product,"" he said.The data center will likely be Palo Alto Networks' sweet spot in 2016, Tomlinson said. Data center protection sales are approaching 40% of all company revenue, McLaughlin said, ""and those are larger devices and larger subscription services.""He says that his company's customers include about half of the Forbes Global 2000. He's aiming for the ""thousand we haven't sold a dime to yet.""""Fortunately, there's a lot going on in the data center space, and security is a prime driver, so I think we've got a lot of room to move,"" he said.Palo Alto Networks stock fell a fraction in the regular session to 165.17, 18% below the company's record high of 200.55, achieved on July 24.

1675,HPQ,"Ingenuity belongs to the inquisitive. Business questions to ask, and answer: Be an explorer. ""You can't just use Google (GOOGL) to make all your decisions,"" said Phil McKinney, author of ""Beyond the Obvious.""Breakthrough thinking comes from willingness to probe.McKinney came up with 150 business-related questions and culled them to 48 for the book. The trick to spurring new thought?""Construct your questions in a way that causes you to look at the problem in a unique or different way,"" he told IBD. Go there. A good question gets you up out of your chair. When he was a chief technology officer at Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), McKinney frequented electronics stores to talk to employees and customers in the midst of the buying process.That's how he found out that people over age 50 weren't buying the company's laptops. That particular model's aluminum keys were hard to read. ""The only way to figure that out is to be out there talking to the customer,"" he said. Detect dissatisfaction.  Don't just ask what constituents like. McKinney's lines include:""What do my potential customers dislike about the buying experience?""What is surprisingly inconvenient about my product?"" Find outliers. Want to expand your company's offerings? Ask: ""Who is using my product in a way I never intended?"" McKinney said.Furniture store Ikea finds answers at IkeaHackers.net. That's where people post hacks — ways they've boosted furniture functionality. Expand client base. McKinney recommends finding new customer categories by asking: ""Who am I not selling to because I think they can't or won't pay for my product?""Pricey designer handbags were out of reach for many women until Web startup Bag Borrow or Steal let customers rent those classy clutches for a monthly fee. Reshape it. Another business expander: ""Can I recombine existing components to create new products for customers I don't currently serve?"" McKinney said.Publisher Conde Nast did that with an app that creates customizable city guides for readers.Vacationers headed for Italy can use it to access travel tips, recipes, fashion stories and architectural points of interest from Conde Nast's various magazines. Tap hidden assets. ""What are we throwing away because we assume it has no value?"" McKinney said.Zoos paid for animal manure to be hauled away, until someone thought to sell it to gardeners.Telecom firm Teligent, where McKinney worked in 1997, threw away records of calls that weren't completed. He sifted through the refuse and crafted a service that detailed what calls failed to get through — so businesses could pick up on missed client opportunities. Look sideways. Tap into others' expertise by asking: ""What industries are analogous to ours, and what can we learn from them?"" McKinney said.A megachurch could look to Walt Disney World (DIS) to learn crowd management techniques for improving traffic flow and parking. Find openings. Want to jump from the corporate to the startup world? Ask what product or process gaps exist in your sector.""Start from these nuggets to figure out how your company can solve a gigantic problem, provide a novel approach or reinvent a broken process using technology,"" said Sally Poblete, founder of Wellthie. She launched the software firm, which helps consumers understand their health insurance options, after working in the industry for 18 years.

1731,HPQ,"Ruckus Wireless (RKUS) stock roared back Thursday on better-than-expected Q2 revenue, as analysts said a rebound might be underway at the maker of Wi-Fi networking gear.Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Ruckus late Wednesday reported in-line EPS. Ruckus stock soared 16% in morning trading in the stock market today, at a three-month high above 12.A slowdown in education spending has been an overhang on Wi-Fi gear makers stocks, including Aruba Networks, acquired earlier this year by Hewlett-Packard (HPQ).Federal funding for educational spending on broadband might finally arrive in late 2015, analysts say. And Ruckus might gain from cable TV and phone company customers.""Schools are just now receiving their funding letters and we expect a pickup once school session begins,"" said Mark Sue, an analyst at RBC Capital, in a research report. ""We peg this multiyear (industry) opportunity for Wi-Fi at $1 billion, significant enough for Ruckus to see accelerating growth if it claims its share. Our 2016 revenues of $444 million are conservatively pegged at +19% growth.""Said Troy Jensen, analyst at Piper Jaffray, in a report: ""The company saw some modest (federal) E-Rate funding come in during the June quarter, but we believe once K-12 spending ramps in the 2H, Ruckus will continue reporting solid growth and operating leverage.""Ruckus also has upside from other sources, including a corporate upgrade cycle to next-generation Wi-Fi technology.The enterprise market — big corporate, government, education and health system customers — has the highest average selling prices and margins for network gear makers.Ruckus competes with Cisco Systems (CSCO), Aerohive Networks (HIVE) and Ubiquiti Networks (UBNT).In a challenge to Cisco, Ruckus and Juniper Networks recently formed a marketing alliance targeting enterprise customers.Cable TV companies such as Comcast (CMCSA), Charter Communications (CHTR) and Time Warner Cable (TWC) are expanding Wi-Fi networks.""Ruckus is well-positioned to benefit from movements both up-market (Juniper partnership) and down-market, as well as further activity from service providers, both with cable TV companies and mobile operators,"" said Jason Ader, an analyst at William Blair & Co., in a report.Verizon Communications (VZ) and other wireless firms are eyeing unlicensed spectrum, as IBD reported, possibly emerging as bigger customers of Wi-Fi gear makers.In Q2, Ruckus said revenue rose 14% from the year-earlier period to $92.2 million, topping Wall Street estimates of $88 million. Ruckus earned 9 cents per share ex items, in line with views.In the current quarter, Ruckus forecast revenue of $96.5 million at its midpoint, about $1 million ahead on consensus estimates. It guided to EPS at 10 cents to 13 cents, including costs from litigation expenses. Analysts had modeled 12 cents.""Management continues to exercise caution in its forecast as it relates to (education spending),"" said Tim Long, analyst at BMO Capital Markets, in a report. ""We believe the guidance for Q3 reflects a high level of conservatism.""

1732,HPQ,"Microsoft (MSFT) on Wednesday launched a campaign to win back consumers with the release of Windows 10, a PC operating system that brings back the familiar Start menu while adding a bunch of new features.Microsoft alienated many consumers with its last operating system, Windows 8, released in October 2012. Windows 8 featured a revamped user interface designed for touchscreens when few PCs had them. It was clunky to use with a keyboard and mouse and hard to navigate because it lacked the traditional Start menu to find programs and files.As a mea culpa to consumers, Microsoft is offering Windows 10 as a free upgrade to owners of Windows 7 and 8 PCs for the next year. The software was available for download and installation starting Wednesday in 190 countries.PC makers including Lenovo, Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Dell and Acer are selling new laptop and desktop computers with Windows 10 pre-installed. Retailers such as Best Buy (BBY) and Staples (SPLS) started selling Win 10 machines Wednesday.Microsoft has set a goal of getting Windows 10 on 1 billion devices within two to three years.Business and enterprise customers flatly rejected Windows 8, sticking with Windows 7 for their PCs. But they've shown a big interest in Windows 10.Nearly 75% of information technology professionals surveyed by Spiceworks plan to deploy Windows 10 within two years. And 40% of respondents plan to roll out Windows 10 within the first year.""For Microsoft, the principal aim of Windows 10 is to a) remain relevant in the enterprise space and b) re-gain mindshare in the consumer space,"" Juniper Research analyst Steffen Sorrell said in a blog post.Enterprises 'Perceive Value'Microsoft's Windows 10 misstep helped Apple's (AAPL) Macintosh computers and iPad tablets gain ground and provided a foothold for Google (GOOGL) Chrome PCs in the market.While Microsoft is offering free upgrades to Windows 10 for consumer PCs, it is charging for upgrades to enterprise PCs.""On the commercial side (of the Windows business), they're in pretty good shape,"" Roger Kay, an analyst with Endpoint Technologies Associates, told IBD. ""There they can charge (for Windows) because those customers really perceive the value.""Initial reviews for Windows 10 have been solidly positive.The most enticing feature of Windows 10 is the return of the traditional Start menu. New features with Windows 10 include the Cortana personal digital assistant, the Edge Web browser, as well as enhanced security to help safeguard against viruses, malware and phishing.""Early reviews have been very encouraging,"" Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brendan Barnicle said in a research report Tuesday. ""Reviewers cite a variety of compelling features.""Some reviews prefer the speed and efficiency over Windows 7 because of faster boot times, pooled storage, improved networking and an enhanced Task Manager. Others report that the voice-activated Cortana digital assistant is very helpful for a variety of tasks, including adjusting system functions. Finally, reports are favorable on Microsoft's new Web browser, Edge.""The potential impact of Windows 10 on Microsoft's bottom line has been largely ignored by investors, Barnicle said. But it could be a source of upside to current expectations, he said.About 250 million PCs worldwide are still running Windows XP, the 14-year-old operating system that Microsoft stopped supporting last year, Barnicle said. Those machines are ""prime candidates"" for being replaced with new Windows 10 PCs, he said.A big question is whether Windows 10 can boost flagging PC sales.Quarters that include a Windows operating system launch historically generate stronger-than-average seasonal demand for PCs, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said in a research report.The Windows 10 release is timed with the back-to-school PC buying season and ahead of the holiday shopping season. PC vendors are hoping for a boost in PC sales to make up for lax demand in the first half of 2015.While Windows 10 can run on PCs that are a few years old, some of its newest features will need new hardware, Technalysis Research analyst Bob O'Donnell said in a blog post .For instance, to take full advantage of Cortana, Microsoft's answer to Apple's Siri, you'll need a PC with array microphones so the software can understand your spoken questions and commands.Windows 10 has a biometric log-in feature that points to a password-less future, O'Donnell said. To use it, you'll need a fingerprint reader or an integrated 3-D camera for facial recognition, he said.RELATED:How Microsoft's Windows 10 is like Coca-Cola Classic.

1753,HPQ,"Worldwide personal computer shipments fell 11.8% year over year to 66.1 million units in the second quarter. But Apple (AAPL) defied the overall market trend and saw its Mac shipments rise 16.1% to 5.14 million units, research firm IDC said late Thursday.Apple was the only top 5 PC vendor to show an increase in shipments last quarter, IDC said. It ranked No. 4 behind Lenovo, Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) and Dell.Though they all experienced year-over-year declines in PC shipments in Q2, Lenovo, HP and Dell gained market share because their declines were less than the overall market.China-based Lenovo was tops with 20.3% market share in Q2, up from 19.4% a year earlier, IDC said. Its shipments dropped 7.5% year over year.Palo Alto, Calif.-based HP was No. 2 with an 18.5% market share, up from 18.2%. Its PC shipments fell 10.4%.Round Rock, Texas-based Dell was No. 3 with a 14.5% market share, up from 14%. Its PC shipments fell 8.7%.The PC market's year-over-year decline was 11.8%, a little more than expected, IDC said.The market faced tough year-over-year comparisons because of the surge in PC buying last year related to Microsoft (MSFT) ending support for its popular but aging Windows XP operating system, prodding many users to upgrade to newer PCs. Also, sales channels last quarter reduced their inventories ahead of the July 29 launch of Windows 10, IDC said.Plus, weaker exchange rates for foreign currencies led to increased PC prices in many markets and reduced purchasing power, IDC said.""Although the second-quarter decline in PC shipments was significant, and slightly more than expected, the overall trend fits with expectations,"" IDC analyst Loren Loverde said in a statement. ""We continue to expect low to mid-single digit declines in volume during the second half of the year, with volume stabilizing in future years.""PC shipments in the U.S. fell 3.3% to 16.4 million units, IDC said.Rival market research firm Gartner late Thursday said global PC shipments declined 9.5% to 68.4 million units. It expects PC shipments to fall 4.4% in 2015.

1754,HPQ,"Many cities have tried to build themselves into major technology hubs where entrepreneurs build startups that reach the big time. Northern California's Silicon Valley remains the leader, but other areas aspire for second place as a tech center.A rising aspirant is Los Angeles, home to the recently anointed ""Silicon Beach."" Like Silicon Valley, S.B. has no set boundaries, but it centers on coastal town Santa Monica and its neighbor, Venice, and includes Playa Vista and other parts of West L.A. The area is packed with tech startups and some publicly traded companies.""L.A.'s tech ecosystem is really taking off in terms of turning innovation into real companies,"" said Gil Elbaz, CEO of Factual, a data analytics platform for mobile devices that he founded during 2008 in Los Angeles.""The area has always been very innovative, but in the last five years we've seen this magical uptick in terms of everything coming together — the talent, ideas and investors,"" Elbaz said.In 1999, Elbaz co-founded a Santa Monica company that Google (GOOGL) bought in 2003 for $102 million. That company, Applied Semantics, became a key part of Google's multibillion-dollar AdSense advertising platform.That same year, Yahoo (YHOO) bought Pasadena-based ad-tech company Overture for $1.6 billion in its bid to challenge Google.It's a common Los Angeles story that some of its best home-grown technology gets acquired and shipped north to Silicon Valley. But this time might be different.Snapchat Not Snapped UpOne prime example is Venice-based Snapchat, the messaging platform with 100 million active users. Two years ago, Snapchat turned down a $3 billion offer from Silicon Valley's Facebook (FB). Snapchat is growing fast.The L.A. tech area includes El Segundo, home of DirecTV (DTV), and Culver City, which includes Apple's (AAPL) Beats Electronics. Other hotbeds for tech startups include Burbank and Pasadena. But the sun is shining brightest on Silicon Beach.Santa Monica, a city of eight square miles, has 1,827 tech businesses, according to the local Chamber of Commerce. It has another 572 businesses in arts and entertainment, a sector that often feeds into tech. Its largest business employer is video game giant Activision Blizzard (ATVI), with 899 employees in the city. Video game developer Riot Games has 712 employees there. China Internet giant Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) bought a majority stake in Riot Games, which operates the massively popular ""League of Legends"" PC-based game, for $400 million in 2011.Moreover, Google recently plopped down a reported $120 million to acquire 12 acres of vacant land in a large business park in Playa Vista. The acreage is next to Google's 40,000-square-foot YouTube production facility, where local artists can create content for the online video site. Google's main presence in Silicon Beach is in Venice, where it leases the 69,000-square-foot Binoculars Building. Google employs several thousand people in the two workspaces.Other big tech companies with a large presence in Playa Vista include Microsoft (MSFT), Yahoo and Belkin Electronics, a large producer of consumer technology, including the Linksys Wi-Fi system.The Silicon Beach-area tech companies are diverse. Many focus on entertainment and gaming, cloud-based e-commerce, online ad technology and social networking. The area also has a large number of business incubators and accelerators — 11 in Santa Monica alone — to help startups fly.""There will never be another Silicon Valley, but L.A. is creating a thriving ecosystem,"" said William Hsu, co-founder and managing partner of Mucker Capital, which operates business accelerator MuckerLab in Santa Monica. ""It's a lot different now than when I moved to L.A. in 2006.""One difference is that Los Angeles now has a cadre of battle-hardened serial entrepreneurs, people who have built several companies and attracted millions of dollars of venture capital. Some of those companies went bust, but that's part of the learning process. Serial entrepreneurs mentor new talent.Entrepreneurs Mentor TalentAmong the area's entrepreneurs is Scott Painter, CEO of TrueCar (TRUE), the Santa Monica-based provider of an online car buying service. TrueCar raised $70 million with its initial public offering in May 2014.Another is Frank Addante, CEO of Rubicon Project (RUBI), an ad technology company that raised $102 million with its IPO in April 2014. Rubicon is based in Playa Vista.Santa Monica is also home to Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD), an online provider of human resource services that made its IPO in 2011. Nearby is Demand Media (DMD), which went public the same year.""L.A. is a great city to build a company,"" Elbaz said. ""It has incredibly talented individuals and a huge, diverse industry base.""It's been a work in progress for many years. Los Angeles and neighboring Orange County in the 1980s were home to pioneering computer, software and data storage leaders. After a dry spell, tech resurged in the late-1990s Internet bubble before it burst in 2000.The difference now is that Los Angeles has the four core ingredients that sparked Silicon Valley.The first is the solid base of serial entrepreneurs.Los Angeles Overcomes SprawlThe second is a center where entrepreneurs gather to exchange ideas, inspire each other and find talent. For Silicon Valley, it started with Palo Alto, Calif., home of Stanford University and the city where Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) was founded in 1939. ""Silicon Valley"" branched out from there to nurture the likes of Cupertino-based Apple, Santa Clara-based Intel (INTC), San Jose-based Cisco Systems (CSCO) and many, many others.Sprawl has plagued Los Angeles, with its tech hubs spread far apart. But Silicon Beach has emerged as a main hub.A third key ingredient is the support of local universities. Like Stanford in Silicon Valley, Silicon Beach gets much help from USC and UCLA graduates. Many say that the two universities had not been helpful in assisting budding entrepreneurs. But entrepreneurs say that the two esteemed universities are finally providing the inspiration and tools to foster startups.The fourth core ingredient is venture capital. Silicon Valley has Sand Hill Road, home to some of the largest venture capital firms. L.A. has no such address, but the Los Angeles/Orange County region received $1.65 billion in venture capital funding in Q1, according to the National Venture Capital Association. That's the most for any U.S. region after Silicon Valley's $6 billion.Big Deals Attract Venture Firms""While L.A. has a small number of local venture capital firms compared with Silicon Valley, a lot of (VC firms) come here on a regular basis,"" said Ben Kuo, founder of SoCalTech.com, which chronicles the area tech scene.Drawing in venture capital requires headline-grabbing transactions. Silicon Beach is starting to show more of them with the IPOs of TrueCar and Rubicon, and with Apple's $3 billion acquisition of Beats Electronics, maker of the popular Beats headphones and provider of a popular streaming music service. Another was last year's $500 million acquisition by Walt Disney (DIS) of Culver City-based Maker Studios, a leading supplier of YouTube videos.""I hear more and more that entrepreneurs who have started companies in other cities are considering relocating to L.A.,"" Elbaz said. ""L.A. has a fantastic talent pool and a great community of investors that offer a ton of support.""After 30 years in the making, the roots of L.A.'s tech community are firmly grounded, the center is crowded, the money is flowing and the beach is hot.""There are thousands of entrepreneurs in this town,"" Hsu said. ""L.A. has hit the tipping point.""

""Given that Nimble is one of the best hybrid storage assets in the market, any buyout offer for Nimble will likely trigger a bidding war as we have previously seen with both Data Domain and 3Par.""And, given that Nimble is executing solidly in both small and medium-sized business and storage environments, and is expected to roll out both Network-attached storage and Object storage in the near term (12-18 months) and will most likely get acquired, we reiterate our buy rating on the stock and maintain our 40 price target.""Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) acquired 3Par for $2.35 billion in 2010, a year after EMC picked up Data Domain for $2.4 billion. Recently, EMC used a separate acquisition to help boost its cloud business.Though Nimble isn't profitable, it's posted year-over-year revenue growth of 89%, 77%, 64% and 53% in its past four quarters.Nimble stock was up more than 2% in morning trading in the stock market today, at a five-month high above 28. Nimble stock is up nearly 25% since April 1 and sports an IBD Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A+. That indicates heavy institutional buying of the stock of late.""The company is executing well and has shown solid momentum in its most recent quarter, and we expect the momentum to continue for the rest of the year,"" Nandury wrote. ""Though the company continues to report solid growth, in our view, much of the price appreciation has been driven by the belief that Nimble is THE acquisition candidate. We tend to agree.""

1833,HPQ,"The silver lining for Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), with its Q2 earnings posted late Thursday, appears to be more about cost savings than growth.The computer products company posted a mixed bag of earnings numbers for the quarter ended April 30, but still HP stock was up Friday.Along with reporting EPS that was 2 cents better than expected, HP said that costs associated with its move to split into two companies will be $400 million to $450 million, where some analysts had expected up to $1 billion.HP stock was up 3% in afternoon trading on the stock market today, near 35.The results could have been far worse, says Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst for FBN Securities in a report Friday. He rates HP stock at outperform.""The bottom line is that this was a mixed report but not as bad as some had feared in light of HP's foreign exchange risk due to high international exposure (65% revenue), and expected dis-synergy costs (associated with the split) came in lower than expected,"" he wrote.HP continues to slog through a five-year restructuring plan launched in May 2012 and aimed at pushing new initiatives, including the cloud and security, to offset revenue growth decline in PCs and printers. The company has failed to post steady quarterly year-over-year revenue growth since July 2011. Splitting the company into two entities with PCs and printers in one company and enterprise services, equipment and software in the other is expected to help solve that issue.HP still has a lot of work to do, Seyrafi says.""Key concerns in the report include enterprise services revenue, down 16% year-over-year and 6% below consensus due to key account runoffs, weakness in EMEA, and IT outsourcing; ... desktop weakness as desktop units declined by 14% year-over-year due to less end-of-(Microsoft (MSFT) XP support benefit compared to last year and slight pause in front of W10; printing margins declining to 3% from 3.7% in the first quarter with weakness in consumer printing due to strong competition from Japanese competitors (Canon (CAJ), Epson), which are being price aggressive (note that consumer hardware revenue declined by 18% year-over-year, and consumer units declined by 6% year-over-year, so the average selling price decline here was over 10% year-over-year); and some deceleration on a constant currency basis year-over-year in EMEA and Asia-Pacific, Japan,"" he wrote.

1835,HPQ,"Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) will have a lot to prove when it reports its fiscal second-quarter earnings after the market close Thursday.The computer products giant aims to rebound from its first-quarter earnings report, which included revenue that fell short of analyst estimates. Sales fell or were flat across all six of HP's business sectors. HP stock tumbled nearly 10% on Feb. 25, the day following its earnings report, to a seven-month low. HP stock is down more than 15% this year.Prior to Q1, HP had been building a groundswell of support from investors as the company gets closer to splitting into two separate companies, with PCs and printers in one company and enterprise services, equipment and software in the other. The split is expected to occur in October.HP is also amid a five-year restructuring plan launched in May 2012 aimed at placing more emphasis on emerging growth areas, including the cloud and security, as PC and printer growth slows.HP is in a quandary by operating in a difficult PC and printer market while trying to compete with rivals such as Accenture (ACN) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) in the enterprise services and equipment businesses, says Brian White, an analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald. He rates HP stock a hold.""PCs is obviously a very difficult business,"" White told IBD. ""though they did pretty well last year. And they do a good job in printing, but it's kind of a secular, declining business.""They are not really great at the enterprise side. In services, they kind of stubbed their own toe and weren't investing in the right places and making promises (to customers) that they didn't deliver on... . I don't think there is anything to look at in services and say that is a great growing business for them.""EPS, Sales Both Seen FallingThis month, Cisco reported stronger-than-expected April-quarter earnings that included growth in its data center enterprise business.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect HP to report earnings per share minus items of 85 cents, down 3.4% from the year-earlier quarter. That would be its first EPS decline in six quarters.Revenue is expected to fall 6% to $25.65 billion, which would be its worst showing in the past seven quarters.For the current quarter, analysts expect EPS to fall 2.2% to 87 cents and revenue to fall 6.1% to $25.88 billion.HP's coming split should boost its shares, Sherri Scribner, an analyst for Deutsche Bank, said in a May 14 research report. She has a buy rating on HP stock.""We view HP as well positioned to benefit from growth in emerging segments like Big Data and converged infrastructure, and expect further operating margin improvements in HP's enterprise business,"" she wrote. ""With shares not currently reflecting HP's strong industry position, growth opportunities and operating margin expansion, we view current valuations as attractive and the stock remains one of our top picks for 2015.""While many investors have focused on near-term negative synergies of the deal, we believe the split will create positive synergies for the company, which should offset any negative synergies over the longer term.""

1858,HPQ,"New data center construction by some of the biggest names on the technology landscape could mean boom times ahead for Arista Networks (ANET), a provider of hardware and software for next-generation data centers.Thus concludes Brent Bracelin, an analyst for Pacific Crest Securities, who cites new data center in the works for Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Facebook (FB) and Google (GOOGL) as one reason to be optimistic for the maker of cloud networking products.Arista competes with Cisco Systems (CSCO) and a number of other vendors. Bracelin raised his price target on Arista stock to 88 from 80 a share.Arista Networks stock was up more than 3% in midday trading in the stock market today, above 76, and at a six-month high.

1863,HPQ,"Dell rose from dorm-room startup to global giant during the 1990s as a PC maker stayed focused on businesses with its build-to-order, direct sales model.
"
1864,HPQ,"That's not to say it didn't try to tap the retail market.
"
1865,HPQ,"""Even though we were tempted and did venture off into some areas that didn't prove very attractive for us, the core direct-business model was so powerful that it kept chugging along and did very well for us,"" founder Michael Dell told IBD in 1999.
"
1866,HPQ,"But that laser focus also might have caused it to miss the industry's shift to the consumer market as businesses slowed their spending. Dell got blindsided by the rapid rise of ultraportable devices such as tablets and smartphones, and fell behind the curve.
"
1867,HPQ,"Struggling since the mid-2000s, Michael Dell took the company private last year. The company continues to serve the corporate PC market, where it remains a leader as it emphasizes services and more. But it's also boosting its presence in tablets, software and services.
"
1868,HPQ,"One key constant, analysts say, has been Dell's strong customer relations.
"
1869,HPQ,"""Dell was able to emerge as this player that was able to provide custom-built PCs very quickly and had strong direct engagement with customers,"" said Krista Macomber, an analyst with Technology Business Research. ""As a result, the business was able to grow, and Dell was able to really establish itself as a partner with customers.

1870,HPQ,"""We see that even today. Dell is the IT department for many of its midmarket customers.""
"
1871,HPQ,"The Round Rock, Texas-based company shook up the PC industry with its custom-built, mail-order business model.
"
1872,HPQ,"The PC business, which Michael Dell famously started out of his University of Texas dorm room, thrived on his concept of building the machines at low cost to customer specifications using commodity components from high-volume electronics manufacturers. Efficient assembly, logistics and just-in-time inventory management sparked Dell's success.
"
1873,HPQ,"The streamlined business model enabled Dell to sell at lower prices than others, often 15% or so lower. Some other companies also offered build-to-order PCs at low prices, but were not considered up to par with Dell's quality.
"
1874,HPQ,"Michael Dell said tailoring personal computers to user preferences would make Dell computers easier to use and troubleshoot. And if users had problems, Dell's customer service was a phone call away.
"
1875,HPQ,"Turned out he was right. He launched Dell Computer Corp. in 1984 with $1,000 and a few employees. By 1995, the company employed more than 7,000 people in 15 countries and boasted $3.5 billion in sales.
"
1876,HPQ,"High-End Yet Affordable

1877,HPQ,"The company became known for its relatively affordable but high-quality PCs and reliable customer service — keys to its tremendous success against stalwart rivals such as Compaq Computer, IBM (IBM), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) and Gateway.

1880,HPQ,"Dell's secret to its longtime success in the corporate market goes back to the strong relationships it formed with customers, analysts say.
"
1881,HPQ,"""That was a very big differentiator for Dell ... . It helped Dell to keep a pulse on its customers and what they needed with their technology,"" Macomber said.
"
1882,HPQ,"Michael Dell conducted his own due diligence by surfing the Internet to gather insight on market trends, speaking directly with customers to find out how they use technology, and walking around at trade shows testing out the latest technology.
"
1883,HPQ,"""In an industry that changes as fast as ours, where product innovation is a constant, if you don't know how your customer feels you're in trouble,"" Michael Dell told IBD in a 1996 interview. ""It's important to deal directly with the customer.""
"
1884,HPQ,"He also made sure to keep the communication lines open within the company, bringing brown-bag lunches and discussing strategy with employees.
"
1885,HPQ,"""My job is to communicate what's going on inside the company and make employees feel proud,"" he said in '96. ""I try to develop an environment that's self-critical and challenging, and encourage people to speak up.""
"
1886,HPQ,"In 1992, the then-27-year-old became the youngest chief executive to run a Fortune 500 company. As CEO, he earned a reputation as a straight-shooter who knew his stuff but didn't crave the spotlight.
"
1887,HPQ,"In presentations to analysts, ""my feeling is that I'm getting the truth, not spin,"" Kurt King, an analyst with Montgomery Securities at the time, told IBD in 1996. ""With other CEOs, you sometimes get campaign speeches, and you have to discount some of what they say.
"
1888,HPQ,"Yet for many years, the company's build-to-order computers were not attractive to consumers, since some key components, including the Intel (INTC) chips that it mostly used, could be expensive, making PCs often too pricey for most consumers.
"
1889,HPQ,"Asked by IBD in a 1995 interview if the company was missing out by not catering to consumers, Michael Dell responded: ""Given the multitude of options we have, we see the consumer market as the least attractive of them. We're more focused on expanding in the business market. Dell is outgrowing the industry and key competitors in a profitable way. If we weren't, then that would be a more interesting question.""

1890,HPQ,"'Dude' TV Commercials
"
1891,HPQ,"Dell, though, became a force in the consumer market in the early 2000s, when it started running TV commercials with the popular catchphrase, ""Dude, you're getting a Dell!""
"
1892,HPQ,"But businesses still accounted for the bulk of its sales, and as PC spending by companies began to slow in the mid- to late 2000s, so did the PC maker's revenue growth.
"
1893,HPQ,"Michael Dell resigned as CEO in 2004 but remained chairman as he handed the reins to Kevin Rollins. In 2007, Rollins stepped down and Michael Dell became chief again.
"
1894,HPQ,"That same year, the company finally began selling Dell systems through retailers, enabling potential customers to see, touch and try out PCs and laptops before making a purchase.
"
1895,HPQ,"In his return as CEO, Dell made management changes, closed plants and cut jobs. Then, in February 2013, Michael Dell and Silver Lake Partners announced a $24.4 billion leveraged buyout, taking the company private. The deal closed in October, 25 years after Dell first went public.
"
1896,HPQ,"Today, besides PC competitors such as HP, Acer, Asus and Lenovo, Dell faces Apple (AAPL) and Google 's (GOOGL) Android on the consumer tablet front.
"
1897,HPQ,"Dell's commercial business is still larger than its consumer segment.
"
1898,HPQ,"""Dell was not able to get ahead of these trends and so as a result, for example, its consumer notebook market share was declining quite rapidly, particularly in 2012,"" Macomber said. ""It re-entered the entry tablet space last year, so we think this will help them in the consumer marketplace.""
"
1899,HPQ,"Dell might face some tough sledding as it tries to grow share in the consumer market, but its customer-engagement reputation could again become the differentiator as it competes in tablets, software and other newer markets.
"
1900,HPQ,"""I think Dell is going to be certainly a competitor to watch over the next couple of years,"" Macomber said.

Gartner put the decline at 5.2%, while IDC said shipments fell 6.7%.Q1 shipments of 68.5 million PCs in the first quarter marked the lowest recorded volume since Q1 2009, IDC said.PC shipments faced multiple headwinds last quarter, including an inventory buildup of low-cost Windows Bing-based notebooks and a slowdown in commercial buying after the Windows XP refresh cycle.PC sales likely will get a boost this summer from the release of Microsoft's (MSFT) Windows 10 operating system, IDC analyst Rajani Singh said in a statement. There is still a pent-up demand to replace older PCs, she said. Windows 10 is expected to combine the best of Windows 7 and Windows 8, the two prior generations of the PC operating system.""Only part of the installed base needs to replace systems to keep the overall growth rate above zero for the rest of the year,"" Singh said.China-based Lenovo remained the top PC vendor in Q1, with a global market share of 19.6%. Gartner pegged Lenovo's market share at 18.9%. IDC and Gartner estimated Lenovo's year-over-year PC shipment growth to be 3.4% and 5.7%, respectively, in Q1.Lenovo experienced its strongest growth in Europe and the U.S. It has become one of the top providers of hybrid notebooks, especially its Yoga line in mature markets, Gartner said.""This quarter and for the last two consecutive years, Lenovo again maintained the No. 1 position in the worldwide PC market by demonstrating outstanding innovation in the PC product line,"" Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing said in a statement. ""PCs remain at the heart of our business, delivering 65% of our revenue and record pre-tax income last quarter of almost $500 million. Given industry consolidation, Lenovo's consistent focus on innovation and delivering award-winning PCs, and our ongoing momentum, we are confident that PCs will continue to be a great engine of strong, profitable growth.""HP stayed in second place with 19% market share, IDC said. Gartner put HP's market share at 17.3%. IDC and Gartner estimated HP's PC shipment growth to be 3.3% and 2.5%, respectively, in Q1.Other major vendors, including Dell and Acer, saw their PC shipments drop with the overall market last quarter.

"
1955,HPQ,"Fusion-io (FIO), a developer of flash-based hardware and software for enterprise data centers, will provide SanDisk (SNDK) with a blue-chip customer base, enterprise vertical integration and a road map to higher gross profit margins, Sterne Agee analyst Vijay Rakesh said in a research note.
"
1956,HPQ,"SanDisk agreed to pay $11.25 a share in cash for Fusion-io, a 21% premium to Fusion-io's closing price on Friday. Fusion-io stock rose 22% to 11.36 on the news, reflecting investor hopes for a possible competing bid. Fusion-io went public in June 2011 at 19 and reached as high as 41.74, in 2011.
"
1957,HPQ,"SanDisk rose 3.6% to 102 on the belief that it got Fusion-io for a song. It hit an all-time high intraday of 102.20. SanDisk stock is up 34% since April, when it reported Q1 earnings that beat views.
"
1958,HPQ,"""Fusion-io will accelerate our efforts to enable the flash-transformed data center, helping companies better manage increasingly heavy data workloads at a lower total cost of ownership,"" SanDisk CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said in a statement. ""Customers will benefit from the addition of Fusion-io's leading PCIe solutions to SanDisk's vertically integrated business model.""

"
1960,HPQ,"""I think SanDisk got a steal with this deal,"" Summit Research analyst Srini Sundararajan told IBD. Fusion-io is selling for a big discount relative to its peers, he said.

1962,HPQ,"""What they are paying for FIO appears to be a bargain,"" Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Mehdi Hosseini told IBD.
"
1963,HPQ,"Salt Lake City-based Fusion-io has had a rough 18 months. It's posted five consecutive quarters of losses, and sales have declined on a year-over-year basis for four of the last five quarters.
"
1964,HPQ,"Fusion-io's key customers last year were Facebook (FB), which accounted for 29% of revenue; followed by Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) at 17% and Apple (AAPL) at 15%, Hosseini said. Those three customers accounted for 61% of Fusion-io's 2013 sales.

1965,HPQ,"Fusion-io Products Expensive
"
1966,HPQ,"Fusion-io has struggled because its PCIe solution is considered expensive, Sundararajan said. It now buys Nand flash memory chips for its hardware from Samsung. SanDisk should be able to cut prices for Fusion-io offerings because it makes its own Nand chips, he said.

"
1970,HPQ,"""If somebody was really serious, they would have done it by now,"" Hosseini said. Of the other Nand chip producers, Micron Technology (MU) and Hynix couldn't afford Fusion-io because of their current balance sheets; Toshiba has made investments in other fabless solid-state drive producers; and Samsung isn't known for making big acquisitions, he said.
"
1971,HPQ,"Other recent acquisitions in the flash sector include Western Digital (WDC) acquiring PCIe competitor Virident for $685 million in cash and Seagate Technology (STX) buying LSI's flash business from Avago Technologies (AVGO), UBS analyst Steven Milunovich said in a research note.

1981,HPQ,"When you're developing cutting-edge technology, it's easy to get carried away. Just ask John Sculley. Apple's (AAPL) chief executive from 1983 to 1993, Sculley had already gained a reputation as a marketing whiz from his earlier years running Pepsi (PEP). In 1992, he oversaw Apple's launch of the Newton, the first handheld personal digital assistant.
"

"
1983,HPQ,"Sculley, now 75, remembers the excitement of unveiling a whole new type of mobile personal digital system. He and his team knew they were creating something that consumers had never seen, but their drive to innovate stymied their ability to alleviate a customer's pain points.
"
1984,HPQ,"""We were focused on this advanced technology instead of identifying a big customer need,"" he said. ""The tech direction we were going in was right, but we were years ahead of ourselves.""

"
1986,HPQ,"""Palm used traditional technology that had been around for years,"" Sculley said. ""But they solved a real customer problem: how to keep track of numbers for a mobile phone and email addresses."" Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) bought Palm in 2010 for more than $1 billion.

"
1991,HPQ,"""The Apple Watch is a beautiful product with a stellar design,"" Sculley said. ""But the reality is we don't know what people will do with it yet. From an investor's standpoint, it's a 2016 story, not a 2015 story. It'll take well into next year to see the real implication in terms of shareholder value.""
"
1992,HPQ,"Sculley has heard that individuals who have tested the watch report that they don't pull out their iPhone as much. They are embarking on what he calls ""a new user experience.
"
1993,HPQ,"""It'll do new things like notify you of alerts on your calendar or allow you to not stop at the front desk when you check into a hotel,"" he said. ""Maybe it'll be used for digital health, or maybe you'll be talking into your watch like Dick Tracy.""

""People wanted an inexpensive way to have a cell phone without a contract, and we reached out to those people."" MetroPCS merged with T-Mobile (TMUS) in 2013.
"
1997,HPQ,"If you want to spur innovation, Sculley suggests asking, ""What's a big customer problem we can solve?"" He urges CEOs to stay close to the customer at every phase of product development and constantly assess what users think and how you can enhance their experience.

2000,HPQ,"""Uber doesn't advertise,"" he noted. ""It's all word-of-mouth.""When you're developing cutting-edge technology, it's easy to get carried away. Just ask John Sculley. Apple's (AAPL) chief executive from 1983 to 1993, Sculley had already gained a reputation as a marketing whiz from his earlier years running Pepsi (PEP). In 1992, he oversaw Apple's launch of the Newton, the first handheld personal digital assistant.""The product failed,"" Sculley recalled. ""We should have spent more time focusing on customer experience instead of saying: 'This is a cool technology. Let's get it out there.'""Sculley, now 75, remembers the excitement of unveiling a whole new type of mobile personal digital system. He and his team knew they were creating something that consumers had never seen, but their drive to innovate stymied their ability to alleviate a customer's pain points.""We were focused on this advanced technology instead of identifying a big customer need,"" he said. ""The tech direction we were going in was right, but we were years ahead of ourselves.""A few years after the Newton launch, Palm Computing introduced its version of a personal digital assistant. It proved a success.""Palm used traditional technology that had been around for years,"" Sculley said. ""But they solved a real customer problem: how to keep track of numbers for a mobile phone and email addresses."" Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) bought Palm in 2010 for more than $1 billion.Newton And The Apple WatchReflecting on the Newton rollout, Sculley says that it's important not to get too enamored of technology.""The lesson I learned is always start with solving a really big customer problem in a way that customers tell you they want,"" he said. ""You want to solve that problem in a way that customers love.""From that standpoint, what does the former Apple executive think of Apple's newest innovation?""The Apple Watch is a beautiful product with a stellar design,"" Sculley said. ""But the reality is we don't know what people will do with it yet. From an investor's standpoint, it's a 2016 story, not a 2015 story. It'll take well into next year to see the real implication in terms of shareholder value.""Sculley has heard that individuals who have tested the watch report that they don't pull out their iPhone as much. They are embarking on what he calls ""a new user experience.""It'll do new things like notify you of alerts on your calendar or allow you to not stop at the front desk when you check into a hotel,"" he said. ""Maybe it'll be used for digital health, or maybe you'll be talking into your watch like Dick Tracy.""The Moonshot ManAuthor of ""Moonshot!: Game-Changing Strategies to Build Billion-Dollar Businesses,"" Sculley now serves as an investor and entrepreneur.In 1996, he heeded the lesson from the abortive Newton launch when he joined the founding team that built MetroPCS, a prepaid wireless carrier. ""We solved a really big customer problem at price points lower than anybody else,"" Sculley said. ""People wanted an inexpensive way to have a cell phone without a contract, and we reached out to those people."" MetroPCS merged with T-Mobile (TMUS) in 2013.If you want to spur innovation, Sculley suggests asking, ""What's a big customer problem we can solve?"" He urges CEOs to stay close to the customer at every phase of product development and constantly assess what users think and how you can enhance their experience.""When you look at all the new technologies, market power is shifting from large incumbent companies to new companies coming out with better customer experiences,"" he said.

2001,HPQ,"Intel slashed its revenue estimate for Q1 by nearly $1 billion early Thursday, citing weaker-than-expected demand for business personal computers and lower-than-expected inventory levels across the PC-supply chain.The Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker, the longtime leader in chips that power PCs and servers, expects Q1 revenue of $12.8 billion, plus or minus $300 million, down from its previous forecast of $13.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million.Late Thursday, market tracker IDC lowered its outlook for PC shipments this year to a 4.9% decline from its earlier forecast for a 3.3% decline.Intel (INTC) stock fell 4.7% Thursday to 30.80, a five-month low. Intel stock has fallen 15% this year.PC operating system leader Microsoft (MSFT) fell 2.3%, but shares of No. 2 PC maker Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), down much of the day, ended up a fraction.""The company believes the changes to demand and inventory patterns are caused by lower-than-expected Windows XP refresh in small and medium business and increasingly challenging macroeconomic and currency conditions, particularly in Europe,"" Intel said in a press release Thursday.Intel noted that its data center business is meeting expectations. Intel is slated to report Q1 earnings after the close April 14.Intel expects its closely watched gross profit margin, or earnings after production costs, to remain at 60% and the midpoint of its guidance as lower PC unit volume is offset by higher average selling prices.Expectations for research and development spending, merger and acquisition spending, and depreciation for Q1 remain unchanged, Intel said.In January, Intel reported a 6.5% increase in Q4 revenue to $14.72 billion, with a solid holiday season for PC sales and mobile phone sales helping boost Intel's results above analysts' expectations. The company saw an increase in PC purchases after Microsoft ended technical support for its Windows XP operating system.

2002,HPQ,"ExOne (XONE) reported a wider-than-expected fourth-quarter loss Monday night as sales missed forecasts, continuing the run of bad news for once-hot 3D printer stocks despite advances for additive manufacturing.ExOne said it lost 50 cents a share, appearing to miss analyst estimates for a 5-cent loss. Revenue rose 47% to $15.8 million vs. views for about $18.5 million. The company, which makes large-scale 3D printers for customers in auto, aerospace and other industrial markets, sold 11 machines vs. 12 a year earlier.The 3D-printer maker sees 2015 revenue of $58 million to $66 million, up 32%-50% and in line with views. But the company has struggled to live up to its guidance, and it sees 70% of revenue in the second half of 2015.ExOne shares fell 9.6% to 10.70 in after-hours trading. The stock had closed up 4 cents to 15.15 on the stock market today. The stock hit a record intraday low of 13.40 on Feb. 4. It peaked at 78.80 in August 2013.ExOne isn't the only 3D printer stock to stumble.3D Systems (DDD) fell 1.1% to 26.93, hitting its lowest level since late 2012. In late February, 3D reported weaker-than-expected earnings and another quarter of decelerating sales growth.Stratasys (SSYS) on Feb. 2 reported weak Q4 earnings and a disappointing 2015 outlook, with its consumer-focused MakerBot line having particular problems. Shares plunged 28% the next day, hitting 51.55 intraday, the worst since July 2012. Stratasys rose 0.3% to 57.95 on Monday.While pure-play 3D stocks sink, 3D printing — or additive manufacturing — takes flight, literally. General Electric (GE) plans to use 3D-printed parts in jet engines that are far stronger than those from traditional manufacturing processes.Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), a traditional printer giant, has been making a big move into 3D printing as well, with sales expected next year. That could put pressure on 3D-focused companies.

EMC's Q4 revenue in disk storage systems totaled $2.35 billion.Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) was No. 2 with a 13.8% share. HP maintained its Q4 lead in server sales, however.Dell was No. 3 in disk storage system sales last quarter, while IBM (IBM) and NetApp (NTAP) tied for the fourth position.""The storage market had a strong finish to 2014,"" IDC analyst Eric Sheppard said in a press release.""Fourth-quarter spending on enterprise storage systems was up strongly in most major geographic markets, driven by traditional year-end seasonality, demand for midrange systems that incorporate flash capacity, and continued growth of systems designed for hyperscale datacenters,"" he said.Storage systems sales by original design manufacturers selling directly to hyperscale datacenter customers accounted for 12.8% of global spending during the quarter.Disk storage system spending for the year rose 3.6% to $36.2 billion.IDC defines a disk storage system as a packaged set of storage elements, including disk drives, controllers and cables.

2037,HPQ,"Investors had an unpleasant surprise for ServiceNow after the fast-growing enterprise software company released Q1 earnings late on April 23 that easily beat Wall Street expectations. The company also provided a stronger-than-expected outlook for the current quarter.Yet ServiceNow stock fell more than 6% on April 24, and fell the following two days as well.The investor reaction perplexed ServiceNow (NOW) CEO Frank Slootman, whose company is taking share from larger rivals including CA Technologies (CA) and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) in IT service management software.""I don't think in all my years of doing this kind of thing that have I ever seen anything remotely close to it,"" Slootman told IBD . ""It all goes under the motto of 'no good deed goes unpunished.'

Salesforce's stock has declined 6%. Tableau, a fast grower in the data analytics market, is down 12% this year. Workday, a leader in the human capital management market, is down 3%. The Nasdaq composite index is up 3.5%.High ValuationsInvestors generally appear to be nervous about the high valuations in the sector — all of the above companies are in the red except Salesforce — rather than any specific fundamental issues, says Kirk Materne, an analyst for Evercore Partners. Also, the young software stocks tend to move up and down more greatly than older legacy software stocks, he points out.""It's more of a general nervousness around some of the higher beta stocks and tech in general,"" he said.Older tech stalwarts such as Oracle (ORCL), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Microsoft (MSFT) and HP are up this year despite recent quarters with decelerating or declining sales and EPS.Investors are placing a higher premium on size and stability rather than fast growth — for now, says Karl Keirstead, an analyst for Deutsche Bank.""You are seeing a growth-to-value rotation,"" he said. ""What is hurting Workday is the flipside of what is helping Oracle.""Splunk might the biggest victim among the highflier group.Splunk stock is down 37% this year, after falling 16% the day after its recent Q1 earnings soundly beat views.The magnitude of Splunk's sell-off is out of the company's hands, says Brian White, an analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald.""It's the cycle of the stock, the stock is in a bad mood,"" White said. ""There was really nothing in the (Q1) report that wasn't good. It was a very solid report.""Splunk raised its revenue forecast for the year from $400 million to $402 million-$410 million. Analysts had modeled for $406.9 million, slightly above Splunk's midpoint.The company's forecast could be construed as light, but there likely are bigger forces at work, says J. Derrick Wood, an analyst for Susquehanna Financial Group.""The shorts are winning over the longs right now,"" he said. ""The issue there is a re-evaluation for these high-growth assets. Where that value should fall is what the market is trying to figure out.""Prior to the sell-off, on Feb. 26 Tableau's stock reached an all-time high of 101.86 a share, or 13 times above the $476.2 million that analysts polled by Thomson Reuters project for 2015.Workday's peak price of 116.47 on Feb. 27 was roughly 19 times its expected revenue of $1.09 billion for its fiscal year ending on or near Jan. 31, 2016.Splunk's all-time high of 106.15, set on Feb. 28, was 29 times the $547.5 million revenue that analysts had projected for its fiscal year ending on or near Jan. 31, 2016.Those valuations have come down to earth. After Friday's close, Splunk's stock was trading near nine times revenue for its next fiscal year, with Workday at 13.5 times revenue and Tableau at eight times revenue.Over the past 15 years, ""growth company"" stocks have seen a mean average of eight times projected revenue, with anything near 20 among the highest, says Daniel Ives, an analyst for FBR Capital Markets.Those high valuations can make investors nervous, Ives says.""Once they start to sell off, it starts to be like yelling 'fire' in a crowded theater,"" he said.Where Is The Sweet Spot?As Deutsche Bank's Keirstead puts it, investors in cloud software companies are still struggling to find prices they are comfortable with.""You are seeing a re-evaluation of the growth software sector and that is why these stocks are struggling,"" Keirstead said.Legacy vendors, meanwhile, are up despite their own struggles.Oracle, Cisco and Microsoft are each up 11% this year, while HP is up 21%.All four companies are in various stages of some sort of reorganization or reprioritization, looking to recharge growth.Investors are attracted to these companies for varying reasons, Keirstead says.""In the case of Oracle, their total revenue growth rate in the most recent reported quarter was actually the highest in three years,"" he said.

Its technology was initially embraced for high-frequency stock-trading environments, where fast data handling is vital. Then its use was expanded to elsewhere in the financial industry.Arista's core product consists of a line of ethernet switching modules used to connect servers, storage devices and other components. At the core of its cloud networking platform is Arista's Extensible Operating System, or EOS. The software operating system manages all aspects of the network and enables customers to integrate a wide range of applications and other customized features quickly.""We believe that our networking technology represents a fundamental advance in networking software,"" the company said.Arista has developed strategic relationships with a number of ""technology ecosystem participants,"" including Microsoft, Aruba Networks (ARUN), F5 Networks (FFIV), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Splunk (SPLK) and VMware (VMW) ""to allow integration of our cloud networking solutions with their offerings.""Arista competes in the data-center market for ethernet switches that run at per-second speeds from 10 gigabits to 100 gigabits.

2096,HPQ,"Hewlett-Packard is on the hunt.The computer product and service giant is looking to reaccelerate growth in part by acquiring cloud, mobile, Big Data and security firms. Analysts, though, don't expect any overnight miracles.Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) CEO Meg Whitman listed all of the above target areas during a Feb. 20 conference call with analysts to discuss its fiscal Q2 earnings.All are sectors where HP is playing catch-up, says Bill Kreher, an analyst for Edward Jones.""Meg basically gave you a laundry list of all of the buzzwords in tech right now, and Hewlett-Packard will certainly have to make meaningful acquisitions in order to have a presence in those growing markets,"" Kreher told IBD.HP's acquisition push into newer areas looks to offset generally declining sales in its core PC and printing units.Those two businesses combined represent half HP's total revenue, so their decline has led to 10 straight quarters of year-over-year drops in overall revenue.HP has little choice but to try to buy into those fastest-growing technology segments, says Brian White, an analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald. ""They are absolutely right to do it,"" he told IBD. ""They don't have the products, but a lot of guys have good stuff already, like IBM (IBM), (which) has a phenomenal Big Data analytics platform.""Whitman says HP expects to have free cash flow, or cash profit, of $6.5 billion at the close of its fiscal 2014 ending Oct. 31.$3.5 Billion For AcquisitionsShebly Seyrafi, an analyst for FBN Securities, says the figure could be closer to $7 billion, which he says leaves $3.5 billion for mergers and acquisitions and half for dividends and share repurchases.""The way to think about logical candidates for HP are companies that have $3.5 billion or less of a market cap and are in the security, mobility, Big Data or cloud areas,"" he told IBD.He says security candidates include Fortinet (FTNT), Proofpoint (PFPT), Imperva (IMPV), Aruba Networks (ARUN) and Ruckus Wireless (RKUS).Tibco Software (TIBX), with its market cap of $3.6 billion, could also be a candidate. The company makes middleware and infrastructure software. But Seyrafi says Teradata (TDC), a data analytics and management company, would likely be too expensive with its $7.5 billion market cap.The values of some takeover candidates have risen on speculation that Cisco Systems (CSCO) and IBM (IBM), in addition to HP, will likely step up their M&A activity, Kreher said. ""All of these large conglomerates are looking at the same companies, which is pushing market values higher,"" he said.HP's stock, meanwhile, has generally been rising since touching a 10-year low in November 2012, as investors bet Whitman can forge a turnaround. HP stock is trading near a 30-month high of 32.41 that it touched on Thursday.But HP's recent acquisitions have been hit and miss.Its biggest blunder might be Autonomy, a U.K.-based search software maker that HP acquired for $10.3 billion in 2011.In 2012 HP took an $8.8 billion write-down on the deal, while charging its former managers with fraud.HP has seemingly fared better with Vertica, a data analytics software company it acquired for an undisclosed sum in 2011.Though HP's software revenue fell 3.7% in its Q1 ended Jan. 31 vs. the year-earlier period, HP CFO Cathie Lesjak noted in the company's earnings conference call last month that Vertica and security ""gained traction"" in the company's Big Data business.HP has also received favorable reviews for its acquisition of 3Par, a maker of systems and software for data storage and information management. It acquired 3Par for $2.35 billion in 2010.Buying 3Par let HP offer converged storage architecture to handle growing customer demand for cloud and virtualized applications, says Crawford Del Prete, an analyst for market tracker IDC.""HP had a problem; they had this virtualized application product that was old and needed to be refreshed, and they didn't have the IT to do it, so buying 3Par was superimportant because it allowed them to improve their product line significantly,"" he said. ""3Par is a huge part of reaccelerating the revenue growth.""But HP's acquisition strategy is likely more about preparing for the long haul than a quick fix for its declining revenue, Seyrafi says.""They are a very big company, so a $3.5 billion market cap security company is not going to swing the needle that much,"" he said.Today's acquisitions could make all the difference for whether HP succeeds or fails several years from now, says White.Acquisitions today ""are not going to matter in the near term,"" he said. ""It's more of 'Let's build the pieces (now) so that in five years we are not totally irrelevant.'""
"
2097,HPQ,"Hewlett-Packard showed some muscle in the fledgling Network Functions Virtualization market by beating Cisco Systems, VMware and others in signing telecom carrier Telefonica to a multiyear pact.Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) is one of several tech giants scrambling to offer NFV, a virtualization computing system that relies more on software than hardware to help service providers speed an increasing amount of data through their networks at a reduced cost.Besides Cisco Systems (CSCO) and VMware (VMW), other NFV providers include Juniper Networks (JNPR).HP will fuel Telefonica's Unica project. Telefonica is moving all of its services, including Internet and mobile, to a new platform driven by NFV and software-defined networking, another technology system where software presides over hardware. The project will take several years.Spain-based Telefonica (TEF) is a large telecom operating in 21 countries, mostly in Europe and Latin America.HP is stepping up its NFV efforts, launched only last year, as the company gets closer to splitting into two separate companies. One will focus on PCs and printers, the other on enterprise products and services.Signing Telefonica should boost HP's revenue and set a bar for rivals in the NFV market, says Crawford Del Prete, an analyst for market tracker IDC.""It's a nice win in advance of the split,"" Del Prete told IBD. ""Carriers are going to be moving more toward these network functions and virtualization environments. This is a big industry shift that is going to be measured in billions.""UBS on Tuesday upgraded HP to buy from neutral and hiked its 12-month price target to 40 from 37.25. HP stock is trading near 33. In a research report, UBS analyst Steve Milunovich said, ""(HP Enterprise is) too hardware-dependent but improving. Software and services need to pick up, or HP Enterprise might be forced to merge with another larger computing vendor.""With the Telefonica contract, HP has seemingly leapfrogged rivals in what looks to be a very large market, says Roz Roseboro, an analyst for Heavy Reading, a market research firm that focuses solely on the telecom market.""From an endorsement standpoint, it's very big,"" she told IBD. ""The market right now is very much up in the air in terms of who is going to end up in the lead position with all of this NFV transformation.""HP provides NFV services for several customers, but Telefonica is a milestone for the company, says Saar Gillai, general manager of HP's NFV program.""This is our biggest deal in terms of providing end-to-end capabilities across our entire portfolio with open NFV,"" he told IBD.Not all of HP's rivals can handle such a large NFV migration, Gillai says.""We are uniquely positioned in this space because a lot of the traditional vendors are playing defense — they have a lot of existing systems that are in the old architecture, and they are not necessarily that motivated to get the new architecture that quickly,"" he said.Other vendors, such as Cisco, are stepping up their efforts in the NFV and SDN markets, said Amitabh Passi, an analyst for UBS Securities, in a March 2 research report.""Unlike years past, Cisco is more openly embracing shifts to software defined networking and Network Functions Virtualization, and in fact accelerating the shift to software and cloud services,"" he wrote.Several other telecom carriers, including AT&T (T) and Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY), are in the process of adopting NFV.Reducing costs and streamlining networks are top priorities, says Roseboro.""They are moving from a world where you have lots of different boxes that are specialized to do one thing and moving all of that onto more commodity servers, which allows you to lower your capex,"" she said. ""And once it's virtualized, you can start using some other kind of IT tools to automate a lot of your processes and reduce your opex quite significantly.""Gillai declined to put a value on the Telefonica contract.""I can say that it's meaningful revenue, and it's also an indicator of things to come,"" he said.HP's revenue needs a boost. In the quarter ended Jan. 31, its enterprise revenue was flat with the year-earlier quarter, at $6.98 billion. And its enterprise services revenue fell 11% to $4.99 billion.

""They need to continue to build out that portfolio, particularly around information management, security and Big Data — and it's just not there yet.""

"
2156,HPQ,"In 2014, revenue jumped 61% to $682.6 million. Management expects revenue of $960 million to $1 billion this year, an increase of 41% to 47% over 2014.

2157,HPQ,"""Very few companies are growing 40%-plus on a $1 billion revenue base,"" said Kirk Materne, an analyst with Evercore ISI.
"
2158,HPQ,"Most of its revenue is subscription-based. ServiceNow doesn't record all revenue upfront but over the billing cycle of a contract, which is typically one or three years. But it recognizes expenses upfront. That and the revenue lag creates a ""mismatch,"" says Rob Owens, analyst with Pacific Crest Securities.
"
2159,HPQ,"Earnings, he said, are a ""lagging indicator,"" while cash flow and billings are more ""leading indicators.""
"
2160,HPQ,"Backlog and deferred revenue combined at year end totaled $1.4 billion, up 57% from the prior year.

2173,HPQ,"ServiceNow also has ""modest overlap"" with cloud player Workday (WDAY), which is focused on human resources, or the so-called ""human-capital market,"" Materne says. He adds that Workday competes more directly with Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP) .

2174,HPQ,"""There are more opportunities to partner with Workday than to compete,"" he said. ""They can help each other sell and grow their customer bases. They're both the disrupters in the broader enterprise software world.""

2224,HPQ,"Synaptics, a force in fingerprint recognition and touchscreen technology, finished calendar 2014 with a bang, and its CEO tells IBD that the company is poised for continued robust growth amid rising global demand for smartphones and tablets.It's not without some cutting-edge competition, however.The San Jose, Calif.-based company earlier this year posted earnings of $1.46 per share for the quarter ended in December 2014, ex special items, a 70% jump from a year earlier. Sales surged 125% to $464 million. For its fiscal 2015 third quarter, ending in late March, Synaptics (SYNA) projects sales of $450 million to $490 million. At the midpoint of that forecast, sales would more than double from a year earlier.Synaptics President and CEO Richard Bergman said in an interview that the company has, over the past few years, deftly made the transition from a PC-focused firm to one with a broader approach that resulted in a dominant position devising ever-advancing technology for mobile devices. Its interface software is designed to bolster the user experience and security for smartphone and tablet owners.Smartphones ConnectAbout 86% of Synaptics' sales derived from mobile products in the December quarter, compared with 14% from PC products, including notebook computers. Three years ago, Bergman says, PC sales accounted for about 50% of revenue. He says sales linked to PC products have only inched down in that time, meaning Synaptics has maintained share in that arena while producing whopping growth in the mobile field to shift its revenue mix to capitalize on high demand.""I'm proud of how we've been able to cross that bridge,"" he said.Synaptics should keep enjoying ""the leading position across high-end smartphones, particularly with content on three leading OEMs (Apple (AAPL), Samsung, Xiaomi),"" Cowen & Co. analyst Robert Stone said in a research note on March 2.Samsung unveiled its high-end Galaxy S6 smartphone at the start of the month. It goes on sale April 10.""Improved Galaxy S6 designs, area fingerprint sensors and Samsung Pay should drive unit growth"" for Synaptics, Stone wrote, adding that he thinks some touch technology in that phone, a touch controller, is by STMicroelectronics (STM).Synaptics' blue-chip customers, he notes, include nine of the top 10 notebook original equipment manufacturers — all but Apple — and that Synaptics' designs are in phones or tablets by the likes of Apple, Samsung, Xiaomi, LG, Sharp and others.Synaptics is part of the Computer-Hardware-Peripherals industry group and has a Composite Rating of 95 from IBD, making it a group leader along with Apple, Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI). It's seventh-largest in the group by market value, after Apple, Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), Canon (CAJ), Fujifilm Holdings (FUJIY), Xerox (XRX) and Zebra.Synaptics carved out a dominant position in fingerprint recognition with its so-called ""swipe"" sensor, embedded in smartphones — including high-end offerings from Samsung — and other devices. This technology works as the name implies: a user swipes a finger or thumb across the sensor and it reads the fingerprint, serving as a higher level of security than typing in a password. Fingerprint Log-Ins EvolveBergman says Synaptics will continue to develop advancing versions of the swipe sensor while it simultaneously rolls out new developments in ""area"" technology, expected to be a key driver of growth in the year ahead and beyond. With an area sensor, users merely touch a finger in a designated area on the device — a simpler process than swiping and one that affords faster reading of the fingerprint to unlock phones, tablets and computers.Synaptics already is mass-producing area sensors, Bergman says, and the company anticipates they will be increasingly adopted by numerous mobile producers over the course of calendar 2015.""We expect several announcements as we go through the year,"" he said.In his March 2 research note, analyst Stone mentioned Synaptics' announcement ""that the small area 4 x 10mm fingerprint sensor is now in mass production"" while describing the Samsung Galaxy S6.""We estimate that the dollar content per phone (for Synaptics) should be slightly higher compared to the GS5, as the area fingerprint sensor should be worth more than the combination of touchscreen controller and swipe sensor on the GS5,"" Stone wrote.The new fingerprint readers, analysts say, could boost growth in mobile as well as in the PC business. Such advances are in high demand as consumers in the U.S., Europe and Asia increasingly access online services such as retail, banking and social media portals, amplifying the appeal of easy-to-manage security measures and providing Synaptics with a long-term growth driver.Market research firm IHS recently predicted that the global volume of fingerprint sensor-enabled devices would balloon from 317 million units at the end of 2014 to 1.4 billion units by 2020.Synaptics is ""always focused on product improvement and solid execution,"" Liwen Zhang, an analyst at Blaylock Beal Van, told IBD. ""I think they will continue to do well, continue to deliver.""Fingerprint recognition is one of ""two pillars of growth going forward"" for Synaptics, Bergman said. The other is touch display driver integration, or TDDI, which combines into a single chip both touch control and the technology used to display the screen on computers and mobile devices.This simplifies design, resulting in thinner touchscreens and brighter displays. It also reduces the number of components needed in the manufacturing process, trimming costs and providing Synaptics' customers added incentive to invest in the chips. Synaptics estimates that more than half of all smartphones will have a display-integrated touchscreen by the end of this year.TDDI Chips Fire UpIn a billion-unit-per-year business, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy said, Synaptics' forecast means the TDDI chips could soon be in some 500,000 smartphones, adding ""that's a pretty big market.""The TDDI advance grew out of Synaptics' 2014 acquisition of Renesas SP Drivers, or RSP, a supplier of display drivers for smartphones and tablets. Synaptics combined RSP's display expertise with its own, aiming to lift the caliber of TDDI and accelerate its adoption.Bergman said that near-term, Synaptics is squarely focused on its efforts in fingerprint recognition and TDDI and doesn't have more acquisitions on its front burner.Deals could help the company drive future growth, he said, adding, ""we will continue to look.""The December-quarter results were the first to include the acquisition of RSP, which contributed about half of Synaptics' sales. Without RSP, sales would have grown about 10% vs. a year earlier.The vast majority of what Synaptics produces gets sold into Asia, where PC and mobile devices are typically manufactured. Though he did not have a geographic breakdown, Bergman said the end products that contain Synaptics' technology are sold all over the world, from the U.S. to Europe to China.The latter is where Synaptics is now seeing tremendous growth. It expects that to continue, Bergman said, not only due to China's massive population but also because the average resident there is gaining spending power, fueling demand for new tech-driven products.""We have a big emphasis on China,"" he said.Qualcomm ChallengesAnalysts note that competition in the tech world, particularly when it comes to those working on mobile devices, is fierce and presents a prominent possible downside for Synaptics. Just this month, chipmaking giant Qualcomm (QCOM) announced new technology that uses ultrasonic sound waves to read fingerprints, even more seamlessly than what is already being rolled out by Synaptics and Apple's own in-house efforts for its iPhones. Qualcomm has said its Snapdragon Sense ID 3D Fingerprint Technology can read fingerprints when a finger is wet or dirty, for instance. Analysts covering Synaptics point to the company's long history of innovation and of staving off competitive pressures.It has operated in the touchpad space for 15 years and has long maintained a roughly two-thirds market share in the segment, Cassidy said. The company, he added, gets ahead of competition and stays there by constantly developing new technology while finding ways to do so at reasonable costs. Its acquisition of RSP, he said, gives it significant added scale that should enable it to continue to produce on these fronts. On Qualcomm specifically, Cassidy said it remains to be seen how well the new offering will be received by consumers and, perhaps more important, whether the technology can be brought to market at a favorable price. He said Qualcomm's decision to go with the technology ""adds a lot of credibility to it,"" but pricing of smartphone components is ""very sensitive,"" as makers of the phones are in heated competition to deliver innovation at attractive rates.""I don't think anyone new to the (fingerprint recognition) market is going to make a shift in who controls volume for at least another year,"" he added.Longer term, Cassidy said, he expects Synaptics to become a force in developing technology for touchscreens in cars and, eventually, in other areas of consumers' daily lives, from appliances to products that have yet to be invented.""I think they are going to be the survivor throughout all of this,"" Cassidy said of Synaptics. ""They've proven that they always find a way.""Synaptics' stock is up 17% so far this year.

2266,HPQ,"ServiceNow's (NOW) growth story is expected to continue beyond its Q4 earnings report after the close Wednesday, as the company moves beyond its core software for information technology departments.One of fastest-growing tech companies, ServiceNow provides software that manages information requests among departments and users of various devices. The company's cloud software has taken share from bigger rivals including Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), CA Technologies (CA) and BMC Software.ServiceNow, which rose 21% in 2014, was down more than 1% in early afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 67.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect ServiceNow to report Q4 earnings per share minus items of 2 cents, swinging from a 2-cent loss in the year-earlier period.Revenue is expected to jump 55% to $193.7 million.The company's Q4 numbers could contain even more upside as its software gets used beyond IT departments, moving into other departments such as human resources, says Kirk Materne, an analyst for the Evercore Group.""There is a fair amount of conservatism in those numbers on the Street,"" he told IBD. ""You see this company beat and raise fairly consistently since it's gone public. At the end of the day, there is probably some room for upside in the year-to-year growth rate.""There are no signs of any slowness for Q4, Richard Davis, an analyst for Canaccord Genuity, said in a research note Monday. He rates ServiceNow stock a buy.""The firm continues to execute quite well. Our checks with deployment partners indicate very high levels of activity and optimism,"" he wrote. ""For the past four quarters this management team has beaten our revenue forecasts by 2-3%, which translates into $4-$6 million in dollar terms. This management team knows how to play the 'guidance game,' so it would not surprise us to see a similar magnitude upside this quarter.""For the current quarter, analysts expect break-even EPS vs. a loss of 8 cents a share in the year-earlier period.Revenue is expected to rise 46% to $202.9 million.The company appears ready to crack new markets, including human resources and financial management, Derrick Wood, an analyst for Susquehanna Financial Group, said in a research report last week. He has a positive rating on the stock.""We think 2015 is the year ServiceNow materially breaks out of IT into other domains,"" he wrote. ""As ServiceNow grows into more of a platform company that can serve multiple business units with both packed apps and custom-built capabilities, engagements should start to happen more at the C-level outside of IT.""

2278,HPQ,"Lenovo held on to the top spot in PC market share in the fourth quarter, but former No. 1 Hewlett-Packard clawed its way back to within striking distance of the lead.Lenovo shipped 16.05 million personal computers worldwide in Q4, giving it 19.9% market share, research firm IDC reported late Monday. Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) shipped 15.88 million PCs worldwide in Q4, giving it 19.7% market share, IDC said.Lenovo increased its PC unit shipments by 4.9% year over year, but HP grew its unit shipments by 15.1%, IDC said.Lenovo surpassed HP to become the No. 1 PC seller in world in Q2 2013. HP had been the top dog since late 2006, when it took the crown from Dell.Overall PC shipments fell 2.4% in the fourth quarter, IDC said. Rival research firm Gartner, which measures the market differently, said PC shipments rose 1% last quarter.IDC said the top five vendors each increased their unit shipments year over year, while all other vendors saw PC shipments decline 20.7%.Apple (AAPL) posted the fastest growth among the top five, IDC said. Apple increased its Mac computer shipments by 18.9% to 5.75 million units in Q4. It maintained its No. 5 ranking with 7.1% market share, IDC said.Rounding out the top five were Dell (13.5% market share) in third place and Acer (7.7%) in fourth, IDC reported.For the year, PC shipments fell 2.1% to 308.6 million units, IDC said. Gartner put the decline at 0.2%. It was the third straight year of declining PC volumes, IDC said.""The strength from market leaders, as well as improvement in Asia-Pacific and the consumer market more generally, are positive signs for the PC market,"" IDC analyst Loren Loverde said in a statement.Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa said Q4 sales were boosted by improved consumer PC business and lower-priced notebooks.""The fourth quarter of 2014 was the best holiday for PC sales in recent history,"" Kitagawa said in a statement. ""The primary driver was mobile PCs including regular notebooks, thin and light notebooks and two-in-ones. Low priced notebooks with about a $200-$300 price point boosted shipments, while thin/light notebooks and two-in-ones (laptops with a detachable or bendable screen) showed strong growth. These results supports our assumption that consumer spending is returning to the PC as tablet penetration has reached the majority of the market.""In the U.S. market, HP was the top PC vendor in Q4 with 30.1% market share. Dell was second with 23.8%, followed by Apple (12.7%), Lenovo (10.2%) and Toshiba (6.5%), IDC said.Later this year, HP plans to split into two publicly traded companies: Hewlett-Packard Enterprise will focus on servers, storage, networking, services and software; and HP Inc. will sell personal computers and printers.

"
2300,HPQ,"Rapidly advancing technology offers a mixed blessing. It doesn't take long for what was once highly advanced and expensive technology to become a more affordable standard. But it also often doesn't make a lot of sense to invest in costly stuff when a fairly short wait will make those products way less of a burden on your wallet.That's what's happening in the portables market. While you can still spend $500 on an Apple (AAPL) iPad Air 2 or $800 on a Microsoft (MSFT) Surface Pro 3, you can get much of the same utility for a lot fewer dollars.What can you get for $250 or less? Here are some options: Apple's tablets are expensive compared with alternatives, but if you have to have an iPad, the original iPad Mini is still being sold for $250.But if you can live with Windows 8.1, the E Fun Nextbook 10.1 has a lot to offer for the money. Selling for $179 at Wal-Mart (WMT), it's a 10.1-inch touchscreen tablet with a detachable full-size keyboard that turns it into a small laptop. Like many tablets, it doesn't have much memory, 2 GB of RAM and 32GB of solid state memory — but it does have an SD Card slot, so you can add another 32GB of RAM with an inexpensive card. The Nextbook 10.1 uses an Intel (INTC) Atom quad-core CPU, which does a decent job on multimedia streaming from YouTube and other sites like Hulu and Netflix (NFLX). If a 10.1-inch screen is a bit too small for you, consider one of the many slightly larger new laptops hitting the stores. The Samsung Chromebook 2 has an 11.6-inch touchscreen and runs the Chrome OS, which is based around Google's (GOOGL) Chrome Internet browser. Priced at $249, the Chromebook 2 doesn't have a lot of memory — 2MB RAM and 16GB of solid state storage — but is designed to be used primarily while connected to the Internet, with the on-device storage used to hold apps that can be downloaded from the Chrome store.Google Docs A BonusFor reports, spreadsheets and the like, you can use Google Docs online, or download these applications onto the Chromebook so you can work on documents, spreadsheets and presentations when not connected to the Internet. There are loads of free or cheap apps available for Chromebooks, but if you're mostly Windows-oriented, then it might not be your first choice. Fortunately, there are some very attractive choices in laptops priced at under $250 that run the new Microsoft Windows 8.1 operating system.The Stream 13 from Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) is a $229 Windows 8.1 machine similar in concept to the Chromebooks. It has minimal memory (2MB RAM, 32GB solid state drive) and is meant to be used primarily while connected to the Internet. A free year's subscription to Microsoft Office 365 and 1 terabyte of online storage is included in the price, and after the first year you can continue this subscription for $99 a year.There's a slot for a MicroSD Card so you can add up to another 64GB of storage for very little money. The Stream 13 is powered by an Intel Celeron CPU (as are most of the laptops in this column) and has a 13-inch display (a version of Stream is available with an 11-inch display for only $200). The Stream 13 (and Stream 11) is available in a bright blue or magenta color and weighs 3.4 pounds. The $249 Acer Aspire E 11 is similar to the 11-inch screen version of the HP Stream but offers a number of features that justify the extra cost. Rather than a small solid state disk, the Aspire E 11 has a 500GB hard disk. It also has 4GB of RAM and an 11.6-inch display, and it weighs only 2.8 pounds. Neither the Aspire nor HP Stream has a fan, and both feature long battery life, with up to five hours claimed for the Aspire and more than seven hours for the Stream. Finally, if you want an affordable full-sized laptop, consider the Asus X551MAV-HCL1201E. Priced at about $230, it is larger, heavier and thicker than the other laptops detailed here, but that 4.7 pounds and 1.2-inch thickness also gets you a large 15.6-inch display, a 500GB hard disk drive and a DVD drive that can read and burn discs, something that's not included with the other portables mentioned.As with the HP and Acer, the Asus laptop features an Intel Celeron CPU and includes Wi-Fi. Also included are an SD card reader (which is nice if you have a digital camera that uses this type of removable memory), a standard Ethernet connector and 4GB of RAM. The Asus portable runs Windows 8.1, the latest version of the operating system.None of the above machines can really be considered appropriate for high-end gaming. But for everyday computing and Web browsing, they all represent an excellent value.

2302,HPQ,"ServiceNow (NOW) may have found the ticket to becoming a multibillion-dollar revenue company, but it will put the company in competition with a new and bigger rival.
"
2303,HPQ,"The enterprise software company is expanding its core IT service-management (ITSM) software into new areas, including human resources, sales and marketing departments.
"
2304,HPQ,"Already known as one of the fastest growing companies in the technology space, ServiceNow gave its followers a taste of its new capabilities on April 23 when it reported that 34% of its revenue in Q1 came from outside of its core IT service-management business.
"
2305,HPQ,"Revenues in Q1 grew 62% vs. the year-ago period. The company also expects annual revenue to grow to as much as $657 million this year. That's up 55% from a year ago.
"
2306,HPQ,"But ServiceNow's product expansion could set the company on a much larger growth path in the next few years, says Kirk Materne, an analyst for Evercore Partners.
"
2307,HPQ,"""They can keep growing at those levels just in their core market for the foreseeable future, but it's more important when you look at three to five years down the road in terms of the company developing into a multibillion-dollar revenue company,"" he said.
"
2308,HPQ,"Though the company's core IT service-management market is still growing at a strong pace, it's probably not enough to satisfy the company's desire for additional revenue growth, says J. Derrick Wood, an analyst for Susquehanna Financial Group.
"
2309,HPQ,"""I'm sure they look and say, 'We want to be a $5 billion (a year) revenue company,' and you are probably not going to do that just by being in ITSM,"" he said. ""They have aspirations to be a lot bigger company, and they have built a much broader portfolio to go after new opportunities.""
"
2310,HPQ,"ServiceNow has been growing at the expense of rivals CA (CA), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) and others through its core software service, which allows companies with multiple offices to manage information requests among several departments and devices. The company's Internet-based cloud software has become a preferred alternative and replacement for bigger vendors that sell older products through a license model.
"
2311,HPQ,"But ServiceNow appears positioned to grow beyond its core business of providing software to power service desks for IT departments, says Steven Ashley, an analyst for Robert W. Baird & Co.
"
2312,HPQ,"""Management is taking that concept outside of IT and into the HR department, the sales department and the marketing department,"" he said. ""This is the first time where their product has been purchased at a very high level within the organization with the intent of using it more broadly.""
"
2313,HPQ,"Bumping Into Salesforce.com
"
2314,HPQ,"ServiceNow's expansion is earning the company a new rivalry with Salesforce.com (CRM), the leading maker of cloud-based customer-relationship management software.
"
2315,HPQ,"The company's stepped-up effort is running up against Salesforce's service cloud, which helps companies better manage their work with customers, says Frank Slootman, ServiceNow's chief executive.
"
2316,HPQ,"""We see them regularly when we get closer to what they direct their service cloud at, which is these customer-facing type of applications,"" he told IBD. ""That is typically where it's possible for us to come in contention with Salesforce.""
"
2317,HPQ,"Some analysts believe that ServiceNow's expansion effort will also bring the company into competition with Workday (WDAY).
"
2318,HPQ,"But Slootman says that the leading provider of cloud-based human-resource management software services is a business partner and not a rival because each serves different needs.
"
2319,HPQ,"""(When) people have requests, they have to manage knowledge and they have problems with benefits or pay, that happens in our system; and when the records themselves have to be changed about employees or policies, that happens in Workday,"" he said. ""They are a system of record, and we are a system of engagement.""
"
2320,HPQ,"ServiceNow is expanding beyond IT service desks in response to customers who want better ways to manage information requests in other departments and across entire companies, Slootman says.
"
2321,HPQ,"""Any department that has to respond to service requests from other people or other departments or other organizations, and it becomes a repeatable high volume of activity, a service-management system becomes incredibly important, because the amount of resources that gets consumed with these activities is insane,"" he said.
"
2322,HPQ,"Fueling the demand are companies using older, licensed-based systems produced by companies including CA, HP, IBM (IBM) and Microsoft (MSFT). Some companies even manage their data exchanges through reams of spreadsheets and e-mail, Slootman says.

2323,HPQ,"""Those are the people that we replace,"" he said. ""Those are legacy vendors; they are typically not involved in new projects.""ServiceNow (NOW) may have found the ticket to becoming a multibillion-dollar revenue company, but it will put the company in competition with a new and bigger rival.The enterprise software company is expanding its core IT service-management (ITSM) software into new areas, including human resources, sales and marketing departments.Already known as one of the fastest growing companies in the technology space, ServiceNow gave its followers a taste of its new capabilities on April 23 when it reported that 34% of its revenue in Q1 came from outside of its core IT service-management business.Revenues in Q1 grew 62% vs. the year-ago period. The company also expects annual revenue to grow to as much as $657 million this year. That's up 55% from a year ago.But ServiceNow's product expansion could set the company on a much larger growth path in the next few years, says Kirk Materne, an analyst for Evercore Partners.""They can keep growing at those levels just in their core market for the foreseeable future, but it's more important when you look at three to five years down the road in terms of the company developing into a multibillion-dollar revenue company,"" he said.Though the company's core IT service-management market is still growing at a strong pace, it's probably not enough to satisfy the company's desire for additional revenue growth, says J. Derrick Wood, an analyst for Susquehanna Financial Group.""I'm sure they look and say, 'We want to be a $5 billion (a year) revenue company,' and you are probably not going to do that just by being in ITSM,"" he said. ""They have aspirations to be a lot bigger company, and they have built a much broader portfolio to go after new opportunities.""ServiceNow has been growing at the expense of rivals CA (CA), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) and others through its core software service, which allows companies with multiple offices to manage information requests among several departments and devices. The company's Internet-based cloud software has become a preferred alternative and replacement for bigger vendors that sell older products through a license model.But ServiceNow appears positioned to grow beyond its core business of providing software to power service desks for IT departments, says Steven Ashley, an analyst for Robert W. Baird & Co.""Management is taking that concept outside of IT and into the HR department, the sales department and the marketing department,"" he said. ""This is the first time where their product has been purchased at a very high level within the organization with the intent of using it more broadly.""Bumping Into Salesforce.comServiceNow's expansion is earning the company a new rivalry with Salesforce.com (CRM), the leading maker of cloud-based customer-relationship management software.The company's stepped-up effort is running up against Salesforce's service cloud, which helps companies better manage their work with customers, says Frank Slootman, ServiceNow's chief executive.""We see them regularly when we get closer to what they direct their service cloud at, which is these customer-facing type of applications,"" he told IBD. ""That is typically where it's possible for us to come in contention with Salesforce.""Some analysts believe that ServiceNow's expansion effort will also bring the company into competition with Workday (WDAY).But Slootman says that the leading provider of cloud-based human-resource management software services is a business partner and not a rival because each serves different needs.""(When) people have requests, they have to manage knowledge and they have problems with benefits or pay, that happens in our system; and when the records themselves have to be changed about employees or policies, that happens in Workday,"" he said. ""They are a system of record, and we are a system of engagement.""ServiceNow is expanding beyond IT service desks in response to customers who want better ways to manage information requests in other departments and across entire companies, Slootman says.""Any department that has to respond to service requests from other people or other departments or other organizations, and it becomes a repeatable high volume of activity, a service-management system becomes incredibly important, because the amount of resources that gets consumed with these activities is insane,"" he said.Fueling the demand are companies using older, licensed-based systems produced by companies including CA, HP, IBM (IBM) and Microsoft (MSFT). Some companies even manage their data exchanges through reams of spreadsheets and e-mail, Slootman says.""Those are the people that we replace,"" he said. ""Those are legacy vendors; they are typically not involved in new projects.""

2329,HPQ,"No matter how perfect a cup may be, a flawed handle can ruin the entire structure. And perhaps the most ominous flaw could be an upward slope to the handle's development.Think of what a cup-with-handle base is supposed to be. A stock falls, bottoms out with new-found support, and goes up. It reaches as high as the cup's left side, a few pennies or dollars more or less. As the stock swings higher, so do hopes for its future. It attracts the attention of new investors — lots of them.Then the stock hits some profit-taking, typically within sight of new highs for the move. The last remaining impatient weak hands bail out.But the selling isn't violent. Crucially, willing hands (usually professionals) will meet the selling on the way down. They're adding to their positions without bidding aggressively.That's the shakeout. Weak hands give shares to the strong. That's what a properly formed handle is all about.Many of the strongest stock advances are preceded by a shakeout. Go ahead, be cynical: A shakeout appears because everyone can't make money. Some must be scared out so they'll have to scramble to get back in.So when you see the handle wedging higher along its lows, you know a few people are still chasing the stock higher. That's the opposite of a shakeout. And when the stock breaks out from that poor handle but doesn't drive up fast, the most eager buyers tend to be already in the stock. Who's left to drive the price sharply higher? Worse, the stalled stock will then start to worry all the overeager longs. That's how failures appear.Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) showed what can happen to a stock that builds an upward-wedging handle. The computer giant built an oddly shaped cup base from July to early November 2003 1. A 9% drop in the week ended Aug. 22 made the cup deformed in shape. Normally, you want to see smooth, tight price action as the left and right sides form.The stock traded tightly for a few months, decisively regaining its 10-week line after seven weeks. Hewlett-Packard hit as high as 23.70 in early November. Then it backed off, and a handle took shape.At first glance you might like the handle: It held support at the 10-week moving average with mostly tight trading. But a simple trendline shows you a rising wedge along the lows. The January breakout was short-lived.

2330,HPQ,"Software-defined networking is moving to the big bucks stage.Annual global spending by Internet, telecom and other service providers on SDN systems — where software takes a more prominent role in network management — will soar above $15 billion in 2018, with a compounded annual growth rate above 90%, says a new study.The findings by ACG Research, released last month, track above two separate estimates of SDN spending by the other main buyers of the technology, enterprises.The ACG report is good news for companies moving fast into SDN, including VMware (VMW), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Juniper Networks (JNPR), as well as a rising number of startups, says Paul Parker-Johnson, ACG's practice leader.""Cisco, Juniper, VMware and Alcatel Lucent (ALU), and to some degree even Red Hat (RHT) and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), may be players, and it's also going to be a mixture of brand-new companies that have made the transition,"" he said.In 2018, ACG says, service provider spending on SDN systems will reach $15.6 billion, up from $626 million last year.No other projections of service provider SDN spending could be found, but two outfits have projectted SDN spending by enterprises.Market tracker IDC pegged annual global SDN spending by enterprise companies at $3.7 billion in 2016, while Pacific Crest Securities forecast $2.2 billion in spending that year. The ACG study has service provider SDN spending in 2016 at $3.9 billion, with a 146% jump forecast for 2017 and another 62.5% rise in 2018.Service providers might be the most demanding market because they answer to a wide range of consumer and business customers, says Parker-Johnson. For them, the need for speed is perpetual.""There is no observable sign that we are decreasing the amount of applications we want to consume — people want their video when they want it and they want their news when they want it,"" he said.IDC analyst Rohit Mehra says the projection is higher than he would have expected. Service providers usually lag enterprises ""in terms of changing infrastructures and technologies,"" he said. ""If you combine the telecom routers and the switches and the optical and the wireless gear globally, $15 billion sounds a little high to me, but it's not out of the ball park.""SDN is billed as providing a more flexible network that can move data faster and more efficiently than before. It requires a combination of hardware and software to be effective, says Parker-Johnson.The vendors pursuing SDN ""are providing really elegant software to enable the applications at the controller level, and so a company like Juniper or Cisco is going to be making money off both the software and the hardware,"" he said.As data and cloud computing explode, service providers need ever faster and more flexible networksAnother challenge for service providers is keeping up with mobile users and apps, Parker-Johnson says. ""It's causing the operators to look for ways to scale up their networks,"" he said.Less Than $1 Billion This YearThe ACG study projects service provider SDN spending at $777 million this year, jumping to $1.67 billion in 2015, $3.9 billion in 2016 and $9.6 billion in 2017.Sales will accelerate as more service providers realize they need to upgrade their hardware to better accommodate SDN software, Parker-Johnson says.""The reason the growth is so steep is that the application providers and the Internet service providers not only want to deliver their applications and use this really cool software that is controlling the infrastructure, they are also going to be buying switches and routers that are being evolved so they can work with SDN,"" he said.Cisco, VMware and Juniper will also be competing with Ericsson (ERIC) and Nokia (NOK) in SDN revenues, says Parker-Johnson. ""You have some international firms from a network infrastructure point of view going hard after SDN and network virtualization for mobile infrastructures,"" he said.Last year, Cisco developed its first SDN hardware and software products and expects to start shipping them soon. Some analysts have said SDN could hurt Cisco, Juniper and other networking hardware makers. Parker-Johnson says the ACG study suggests otherwise.IDC's Mehra says the jury is out until at least 2015. It's too early to expect SDN to become a revenue boon for companies like Cisco and Juniper overnight, he says.""Many customers are still in the process of sorting out what SDN means to them, so there is not necessarily hundreds of millions of dollars in deals that Cisco would get for SDN,"" Mehra said.

2333,HPQ,"They were ""CrackBerry"" addicts — fans so devoted to the BlackBerry that being without it caused withdrawals.Madonna confessed on TV to Oprah Winfrey that she slept with her BlackBerry smartphone. Corporate leaders were equally passionate.""No one else had what they offered,"" said Jack Gold, principal of research firm J. Gold Associates. ""They fundamentally changed the handheld market.""BlackBerry (BBRY) was founded in 1984 in Waterloo, Ontario, as Research In Motion by a pair of Canadian engineering students: Mike Lazaridis and Douglas Fregin. They made wireless point-of-sale systems, pagers and modems. Research In Motion, which changed its name to BlackBerry last year, plodded along until striking gold on Jan. 19, 1999, with the first BlackBerry device, the 950.The handheld — though not a phone — was the first device to provide mobile users with a wireless connection to their desktop email. The 950 had a qwerty keyboard, calendar, address book, calculator and alarm. Though primitive by today's standards, it was cutting edge at the time for the simple reason that it could send and receive emails, a task no other portable device could handle.""Wall Street was just waking up to the power of email at the time,"" Lazaridis told IBD.Leapfrogging The PagerThe most popular portable communications device then was the two-way pager, which could send and receive only short bursts of data. Through ingenuity and intense R&D, BlackBerry leapfrogged every other portable communications device with its proprietary method of managing data.""It separated us from all our competitors,"" Lazaridis said.To promote awareness of the BlackBerry 950, the company gave them away to some powerful executives in New York and their assistants.""No one gave them back,"" Lazaridis said. ""It was a new way of conducting business, superior to an executive having to call an assistant to have email read over phone, which is how it was done back then.""BlackBerry orders started rolling in.The 950 was followed by a succession of more advanced products. Not only was demand for the devices strong, so was the desire to own BlackBerry stock, which would go on two major runs.From October 1998 through February 2000, BlackBerry stock would run up 5,437%. And its second stock advance, from 2002 into 2008, nearly doubled that performance.At its June 2008 peak, BlackBerry stock stood 27,902% higher than its level just before the 1998 move. That made it one of the great stocks of the past three decades.The first run-up was during the era of personal digital assistants. The PDA was a handheld information manager. The term PDA was coined in 1992 by Apple (AAPL) CEO John Sculley, referring to the Apple Newton. Nokia (NOK), Palm, Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) and IBM (IBM) also cranked out early PDAs.But BlackBerry prevailed. No one could match its wireless messaging performance and data security.The secret sauce was the BlackBerry Enterprise Server middleware software, which managed the messaging features, software apps and data encryption. It also connected to the widely used Microsoft Exchange email system, among others.With its business booming, BlackBerry had the financing available for its next big invention — the BlackBerry handset, arguably the first-ever smartphone.On March 4, 2002, BlackBerry introduced the 5810, the first BlackBerry with cellphone capability. BlackBerry was now going head-to-head with Nokia, Motorola and the other cellphone leaders, many of which had huge marketing budgets. But BlackBerry had the killer app.""In the early days BlackBerry was not a good voice phone,"" Gold said. ""But they still had what people wanted most, portable email, and that is what BlackBerry was very good at.""It got better. In 2003, BlackBerry introduced a succession of improved smartphones, including the first BlackBerry with a color screen, the 7210.""We were facing fierce competition against very large gorillas and we were just a small startup,"" Lazaridis said.But when the company announced results for the three months ended Aug. 30, 2003, it had 711,000 BlackBerry subscribers, up from 96,000 in the year-earlier quarter. Its revenue jumped 73% that quarter, to $126 million. That Dec. 23, BlackBerry joined the Nasdaq 100, the index of the exchange's premier companies.CrackBerry addiction intensified. In 2007 came the BlackBerry Pearl, aimed at consumers. That was followed by the powerful and classy BlackBerry Curve.Celebrity ChicBlackBerry tapped into the celebrity obsession by staging the rollout of the Curve at a posh party in Beverly Hills attended by such celebrities as Donald Sutherland, Paris Hilton and Jessica Alba. By then BlackBerry was in 135 countries, sold by 350 carriers.Jim Balsillie, who joined the company in 1992, explained his view of BlackBerry's success in an interview with IBD in May 2008, when he was co-CEO.""We don't think of BlackBerry as a cellphone,"" he said. ""We think of it as a smart appliance, and we've defined the category and the value proposition around that.""All along, BlackBerry maintained its iconic qwerty keyboard with scrolling keyball.The BlackBerry became the top-selling smartphone in the U.S. for several reasons. It was widely used by governments, the military and first responders. The BlackBerry, with its enterprise-grade email, was also the favored device of senior executives, who used their sway to make them more widely used in their companies.""BlackBerry had a very loyal following in the executive ranks and made it very easy for companies to buy these devices,"" said Gold.BlackBerry made it easy because it had the best security. The company also worked closely with tech departments of large companies, providing the help needed to quickly integrate BlackBerry's email into a company's infrastructure.The end of BlackBerry's stock run came not long after Apple rolled out its first iPhone, in June 2007. From October 2002 through June 2008, the stock recorded a 10,557% surge, but it couldn't match Apple's technology, which put smartphones in a whole new league.""When we looked at the iPhone, we realized Apple had compressed its Macintosh into a handset,"" Lazaridis said.It wasn't a rapid wipeout. In 2010, BlackBerry still had the leading share of the U.S. market. But Apple had redefined the smartphone, and Google (GOOGL) followed with its Android operating system for mobile devices, which Samsung, among others, embraced.With iPhone and Android, the smartphone market had shifted, requiring BlackBerry to make major changes. But BlackBerry was unable to turn the battleship fast enough.""We had to make a wholesale platform change, which very few companies are able to do successfully in a short period of time,"" Lazaridis said.In 2012, with the major overhaul of the BlackBerry platform complete, Lazaridis stepped down from his co-CEO role.In March 2013, Lazaridis and his BlackBerry co-founder Fregin established the Quantum Valley Investment Fund, in Waterloo, to provide financial and intellectual capital for the development and commercialization of quantum physics and quantum computing breakthroughs.

2507,HPQ,"So you're 55 years old. Maybe 70 and older. And you're wondering whether your professional heights are way behind you.Think again, says Jim Collins. The red-hot author sees that older range as full of opportunity.He points to geniuses in the worlds of art (Pablo Picasso) and architecture (Frank Lloyd Wright) who stayed productive well into their 70s to 80s.""At 65, we've used only one-third of our peak creativity resources,"" Collins, a Colorado-based business historian and researcher, told a crowd at the ISPA expo — a trade show for the luxury spa industry — last month in Orlando, Fla.Collins got a standing ovation.The author of the best-seller ""Good to Great"" offers other tips on how to reach the mountaintop:• Listen to criticism and ideas. In 1996, Collins attended a business dinner to talk about organizational performance. Bill Meehan, who was a managing director of the consulting firm McKinsey & Co., lauded the author for the ""very fine job"" in research of his book ""Built to Last."" Meehan added, ""Unfortunately it's useless.""Collins asked why. Meehan explained that the companies featured in the book were already great from the start. Why? They had fantastic leaders, including David Packard of Hewlett-Packard (HPQ). But the book ignored the ""vast majority of companies that wake up partway through life and realize that they're good, but not great."" Among these firms, how did some become great?That Meehan comment supplied the seed that created ""Good to Great,"" perhaps Collins' most influential work. The author calls the razor-sharp remark a gift.• Set flexible goals. When Norwegian Roald Amundsen was set to conquer the North Pole, he opened the newspaper one morning to find that Robert Peary beat him to the punch, claiming he arrived there in April 1909. Amundsen stayed cool. He told his crew that they would be the first to reach the earth's other pole.Amundsen prevailed in December 1911, arriving in central Antarctica one month ahead of a British team led by Robert Scott.• Advance. Take a good idea from somewhere else and find a way to execute the idea better. The key, Collins says, is to be disciplined and work consistently.""To be human is to be creative,"" he said at the International Spa Association expo. ""But you want discipline to amplify your creativity. How many of us were incredibly disciplined at age 5?""Collins notes that Amundsen won the race to the South Pole by studying Eskimo life. By living with them for several months, he learned that dog sleds would be the most efficient and reliable means of moving across the frozen continent. Scott tried to be too creative; he used horses, which died by freezing in their own sweat.• Capitalize. Collins uses the phrase ""return on luck."" He and Morten Hansen figured out a way to define, quantify and systematically study the role of luck in business success. ""Great leaders seize good luck and make the most of it,"" Collins told Pulse magazine.• Look ahead. Collins once asked Peter Drucker, a pioneer in the study of management, to name the favorite book he wrote.""The next one,"" replied Drucker, who went on to write 10 more books before his death in 2005.

""Operating margins are still at a seven-year low of 8.5% vs. a peak of 11.4%.""Bracelin raised his earnings-per-share estimates on expectations for a PC refresh cycle, enterprise-share gains — mostly from IBM and Acer — and profit-margin expansion.""Despite the sharp move in the stock off the bottom, HPQ is still in the early innings of a multiyear turnaround, in our view,"" Bracelin said.Pacific Crest has historically had a neutral or negative bias toward HP, stemming from concerns about its eroding core business, market-share losses and secular head winds. The upgrade to outperform is the first time that Pacific Crest has been positive on HP since initiating coverage on the stock in 2004, Bracelin said.""Our bias on HPQ today has substantially improved after careful examination of the IT supply chain, changing competitive dynamics, turnaround progress, strategic direction from new leadership and new initiatives that are rebuilding channel support,"" Bracelin wrote.

"
2531,HPQ,"Due this month, Havana is expected to iron out some of the technical issues uncovered by enterprises that have been testing OpenStack in data centers.

2632,HPQ,"Some of tech's biggest giants might ultimately claim the largest share of the emerging multibillion-dollar Big Data market, though they are playing catch-up.Oracle (ORCL), SAP (SAP) and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) are scrambling to tackle Big Data and compete with nimble newcomers such as Splunk (SPLK) and Tableau Software (DATA).Big Data in general describes the large volume of data companies are accumulating from multiple sources in the digital age, and how to best manage and use that data with analytics software and services. (See related story, this page.)Tableau and Splunk are notching 50% to 70% quarterly year-over-year sales growth rates for their analytics software, which helps companies analyze their Big Data. But analysts say Oracle, SAP, HP and other big vendors will move deeper into the field, boosted by acquisitions.It will happen, but not overnight, says Dan Vesset, an analyst for market tracker IDC.""The (software vendors) realize this is real, this is the future,"" Vesset said. ""If you are not providing a solution that deals with large amounts of data, then you are going to be left out of a large segment of the market.""By 2014, we will see an acceleration of M&As, but it will probably take five years-plus (before large companies dominate Big Data).""Research firm MarketsandMarkets agrees, saying smaller firms offering analytics and business intelligence software will dominate in the near term before larger tech companies catch up.""Considering the complex ecosystem of the Big Data market, pure-play vendors such as Tableau, Karmasphere, Cloudera, Splunk, etc. are expected to reap the most benefit,"" the research firm told IBD via email. ""However, as Big Data solutions get commoditized, the demand for integrated Big Data solutions will increase and leading hardware and software vendors such as IBM (IBM), HP, Dell, Oracle, SAP and EMC (EMC) will gain substantial market share in the coming years.""The big boys already are jumping in. For example, in September SAP said it would acquire Kxen, a Big Data software analytics company. Terms weren't disclosed.Still, some of the young guns might survive long enough to challenge IBM and Oracle, says Aapo Markkanen, an analyst for ABI Research.""It's quite likely the new generation of Big Data firms like Splunk are going to make it,"" he said. ""Some of them will live up to the challenge, but not all of them.""Venture capital will aid the startups.Enterprise software firms have attracted $893 million in venture funding this year through August. That compares with $877 million for all of 2012 and $726 million in 2011, says IDC.But even a robust Big Data market can't support everyone, says IDC's Vesset.""These new guys are doing a lot of innovative and interesting things, but it's no different than any other market, whether it's soft drinks or cars,"" he said. ""Some of (the startups) may make it, but the vast majority will either be incorporated into bigger companies, remain small or go out of business.""Software to help with Big Data is needed because Big Data is getting ... bigger. Companies are becoming overwhelmed with the growing amount of data from data centers, websites, mobile phones, social media and other sources.Edmunds.com uses analytics software produced by Splunk to examine traffic trends, security concerns and other issues across four auto-related websites that it operates. Dell has used analytics software from privately held Ayata to improve its relations with customers by finding a better way to sift through data from thousands of customer service agents spread across multiple locations. The NBA's Portland Trail Blazers used data analytics software from privately held Ayasdi to better analyze statistics in order to improve its player drafts.Companies want solutions. And vendors want to cash in. And nobody on either side of that equation wants to be left out, says Douglas Laney, an analyst for research firm Gartner.""Vendors see it as a Gold Rush to be a provider of Big Data-related technology capabilities and services,"" he said. ""And companies are looking to take advantage of all of this data that is available.""In an August report, MarketsandMarkets said it expects global Big Data revenue to reach $46.34 billion in 2018 vs. $14.87 billion this year. This month, Gartner forecast Big Data spending near $55 billion in 2016, up from $33 billion this year. Last January, IDC said it expects Big Data to produce revenue of $23.8 billion in 2016.ABI Research says global revenue from Big Data could reach $114 billion in 2018, up from $31 billion this year.ABI says salaries account for 50% of the spending as Big Data vendors and their enterprise customers alike hire data scientists and other experts to find the best ways to leverage data.Professional services remain the top priority for Big Data spending for now, says Gartner's Laney.""We see almost a five-to-one demand for services compared to technology right now,"" he said. ""One-third of the organizations can't hire the type of talent they are looking for.""But spending on hardware and software systems will become more prevalent, Laney says.""Like with any new type of technology or concept it becomes very services-heavy at the beginning,"" he said. ""We are still in the early days ... Over time software is gaining ground.""

2745,HPQ,"Shares of Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) surged over 3.8% following an announcement that it landed a multi-year deal with Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) that will see its esports Overwatch League broadcast live on both ESPN and ABC during the July postseason and beyond. Now let’s dive into why this deal matters not only for Activision Blizzard but for Disney and the future of live TV as well.The Deal Activision Blizzard and Disney announced on Wednesday that this year’s Overwatch League playoffs, which begin Wednesday night, will be broadcast across ESPN, ESPN2, Disney XD, ABC, and various Disney-owned streaming services through the end of July. The deal also includes Overwatch League Season 2 and will amount to hundreds of hours of live coverage and highlights, some of which will be broadcast in primetime on ESPN.The deal marks the continuation of ESPN’s push into esports, which currently includes podcasts and its own vertical on ESPN.com. “The Overwatch League Grand Finals is by far our most comprehensive television distribution for an esports event over a single weekend: 10 total hours over four networks and three days,” ESPN executive Justin Connolly said in a statement.“This overall collaboration with Disney/ABC, ESPN and Blizzard represents our continued commitment to esports, and we look forward to providing marquee Overwatch League coverage across our television platforms for fans.”Disney secured the deal for an undisclosed amount, and it is worth noting that its TV and streaming contract will not impact existing rights agreements the Overwatch League has with partners such as Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) widely popular Twitch streaming platform.Why It Matters The Overwatch League is set to conclude its inaugural season this summer. The league is a huge step in the right direction for esports, which have been on the rise for years, since it features city-based teams competing in a regular season followed by a postseason. This could prove key to converting non-gamers and sports fans into esports watchers.Activision Blizzard’s league already features 12 teams, spread across the U.S., Europe, and Asia—including Los Angeles, London, and Shanghai. The league also boasts some big name owners, from New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft to Los Angeles Rams and  Denver Nuggets owner Stan Kroenke, with all the groups having paid $20 million per team to reserve franchise spots this season. And there are already rumors that the new teams expected to join next season could pay even more.That might seem rather crazy to people who don’t know much about esports, but the Overwatch League said it would hand out $3.5 million in performance bonuses during the first season, including $1 million during the postseason. On top of that, all the players started on a league minimum salary of $50,000, plus health insurance and retirement plans—which already puts them up with some WNBA and MLS players.Meanwhile, the overall esports economy is expected to total $906 million in 2018, up from $696 million in 2017,according to market research firm Newzoo—with the potential to hit $1.5 billion by 2020.The firm also noted that 77% of this revenue will be generated directly from marketing, sponsorships, and media rights.Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), T-Mobile (TMUS  -  Free Report), and HP (HPQ  -  Free Report) all sponsored Activision Blizzard’s Overwatch League during the first season, which is set to run from last December’s preseason through the All-Star weekend in August.Disney’s push into esports demonstrates just how important live sports are, because even if some don’t see esports as a “real” sport, they are games that have that all-important live aspect. This is why Amazon spent millions to broadcast the NFL again over the next two seasons, and why both Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) have continued their push into live sports in the age of Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), where advertisers are willing to spend big on anything and everything live.Bottom Line Disney hopes to continue to gobble up more and more content as it aims to launch its own over-the-top streaming service in late 2019, while also bolstering its ESPN streaming offerings.

2747,HPQ,"Shares of HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) have been gaining solid momentum, of late. One of the major reasons behind this could be the company’s stellar second-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Also, encouraging third-quarter and full-fiscal outlook drove its shares higher.Notably, the company has gained approximately 10.6% since it reported fiscal second-quarter results on May 29. In fact, HP has an impressive earnings surprise history with beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in thrice in the trailing four quarters while matching the same on one occasion. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 4.2%. Backed by the impressive results, the company has issued an upbeat outlook for the third quarter as well as full fiscal.The stock has outperformed the S&P 500 index in the year-to-date period. HP has returned 12.1% in the said period, while the index has gained 3.5%.Let’s take a look at what factors are driving HP’s back-to-back robust quarterly performances.Restructuring Initiatives Paying OffIt should be noted that since its split from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) in November 2015, HP has been trying to stabilize shrinking sales and eroding profits through a series of restructuring initiatives.As part of its restructuring efforts, HP has adopted a strategy of focusing on product innovation & differentiation, pricing, and marketing and sales activities to spur demand for its PC products in the market. The company has rolled out a number of models under its PC product lines of EliteBook, Spectre and Pavilion Wave, over the past two years.Impact of these initiatives is evident from the fact that the company regained the pole position in the PC segment by displacing Lenovo. Also, according to the data compiled by IDC, the company’s PC shipments registered the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in Q1, after witnessing several quarters of decline.The company’s efforts to revamp the printing business have also been commendable. It should be noted that HP has acquired Samsung Electronics’ printer business. This acquisition is a strategic fit for HP as it has expanded the company’s printing business, with the addition of 6,500-plus printing patents owned by Samsung.In addition to the above, the company is now focused on fortifying its 3D printing business capabilities. However, unlike 3D Systems (DDD  -  Free Report) and Stratasys (SSYS  -  Free Report), which target all kinds of consumers, HP is emphasizing only on industrial markets due to their ability to afford a premium range of 3D printing solutions. It should be noted that even though HP has been operating in this space for almost five years now, it still lags behind 3D Systems and Stratasys.However, these efforts have paid off well, with the company registering the fifth consecutive quarter of print business revenue growth in the fiscal second quarter.On the cost front too, HP has taken strategic steps, which includes divestment of its content management software tools and Customer Communications Management (CCM) assets to Open Text Corporation, and elimination of 4,500-5,000 jobs.Per the company, the divestment of CCM has led to cost reduction and enhanced productivity, thereby boosting profitability. The job cuts are anticipated to generate annualized cost savings of approximately $200-$300 million from fiscal 2020 onward.Impressive ValuationsThe stock currently trades at a forward earnings estimate at 11.8x, which is way lower than the industry to which it belongs to average of 16.3x. Given its recent track record of revenues and earnings growth, as well as the long-term forecast, the stock is highly undervalued which signifies that it still has significant upside potential.Moreover, HP has a VGM Style Score of A. We note that our VGM score highlights the determining elements in a stock that can push the stock price higher. We can essentially filter out the negatives and focus on the positives which drive its price.Consequently, we believe the stock has huge potential to surge higher and therefore, investors should consider it for near-term opportunities.

2751,HPQ,"Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) has reportedly made some progress in solving its component supply woes related to organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens.Per Bloomberg, the iPhone-maker is set to receive its first batch of OLED screens for new iPhone model from South Korea’s LG Display Co.Apple, in order to expand its supply chain, reportedly invested more than $2 billion in LG, last year. The company is the sole supplier of OLED screen of Apple Watch.However, owing to some manufacturing problems, LG had difficulties to move into mass production of OLED screen. The company is now expected to ship 2-4 million units, initially. Apple Inc. Price and Consensus Apple Inc. Price and Consensus | Apple Inc. Quote Apple was also in talks with China’s BOE Technology Group Co. to supply OLED displays for iPhones.Notably, Apple has also been rumored to develop next-generation MicroLED screens for its own use. We believe bringing display manufacturing in house makes sense for Apple as it will no longer have to depend on others for supply of display screens.Supplier Base Expansion Good for AppleApple is expected to launch three iPhone models this year, two out of which — a 5.8-inch second-generation iPhone X and a larger 6.5-inch iPhone X Plus — are expected to come with OLED displays. The low-cost third one is likely to be a 6.1-inch LCD (liquid crystal display) variant.Moreover, Apple is reportedly planning to use OLED display panels in all three new iPhone models planned for next year.In such a scenario, the expanding supplier base not only reduces Apple’s dependence on Samsung, its sole supplier of OLED screens, but also improves bargaining power in terms of pricing.Higher OLED procurement cost has been primarily blamed for iPhone X’s exorbitant starting price of $1,000. Per KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo’s estimates, Apple pays Samsung in the range of $120-$130 per unit. This is significantly higher than iPhone 7 Plus’5.5-inch LCD, which costs $45 to $55 per unit.The highly anticipated device failed to generate significant demand, due to premium pricing. Apple also had to cut production, due to lack of demand.Moreover, Apple had to delay the launch of iPhone X, due to the lack of adequate number of OLED screens, which also hurt its holiday season sales. Hence, the increased volume of OLED screens will help Apple reduce the time to market for its new iPhones.However, Apple’s transition to OLED is a serious concern for its LCD screen suppliers like Japan Display and Sharp that lag in OLED production.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report), Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report) and Verint Systems (VRNT  -  Free Report) are stocks worth considering in the broader Computer and Technology sector.

2752,HPQ,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 8.2% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is HPQ due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Recent EarningsHP delivered another quarter of stellar performance wherein its revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while earnings matched the same. Moreover, the company’s revenues increased for the seventh consecutive quarter, out of which the last six recorded double-digit growth after a prolonged period of decline. Also, the Personal Systems and Print segments’ performance improved for the fifth straight quarter, after 2010.In fact, the company’s outstanding results for the last few quarters substantiate that the spin-off from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, along with its diligent restructuring initiatives, is finally paying off.HP’s total revenues climbed 13% year over year to $14 billion and outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.6 billion. The better-than-expected top-line performance was driven mainly by strength in the Personal System and Printing segments, as well as successful product roll outs.The company’s bottom-line results were also impressive, wherein its non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of 48 cents per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, and came toward the higher-end of management’s guided range of 45-49 cents. On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP earnings improved 20%. The robust bottom-line performance was mainly backed by higher revenues and lower share counts.Quarter in DetailThe Personal Systems segment generated revenues of $8.8 billion, up 14% year over year, mainly driven by strong demand for high-end products and a 7% rise in prices.  While commercial revenues increased 16%, consumer revenues were up 10%.We believe the spin-off from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, and restructuring initiatives, such as focus on product innovations, pricing, marketing and sales activities, are ultimately paying off.Notably, International Data Corporation, in its latest report on first-quarter 2018 PC shipment, stated that this quarter marked the eighth consecutive quarter of overall shipment growth for HP.Coming to the Printing business, the segment’s revenues were up 11% year over year to $5.2 billion, primarily stemming from an 8% increase in supplies revenues and inclusion of the recently-acquired business of Samsung’s printing (S-Print) business. It should be noted that the buyout of S-Print has helped HP in the $55-billion high-end copy-machine market where Xerox Corporation is currently the leader.HP’s total hardware unit sales grew 13%, backed by the Consumer hardware unit’s increase of 4% and the Commercial hardware unit’s year-over-year growth of 88%. The robust growth in Commercial hardware units chiefly stemmed from the recent inclusion of S-Print business.Region wise, the company registered double-digit growth in every region it operates. Revenues from Americas were up 7% year over year. While revenues from Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) climbed 21%, the same from the Asia Pacific and Japan region jumped 13% year over year.Gross margin expanded 10 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 19.3%. This was primarily supported by increased pricing and improved mix in the Personal Systems segment, which more than offset elevated component costs, particularly the NAND flash chips.Non-GAAP operating expenses flared up 16% year over year to $1.7 billion. This was mainly due to the inclusion of the S-Print business, and increased investment in research and development, as well as go-to-market sales strategies.Non-GAAP operating margin from continuing operations remained flat year over year at 7%, as benefit from improved gross margin was fully offset by elevated operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. HP’s non-GAAP net income from continuing operations came in at $798 million compared with $685 million reported a year ago.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowHP ended the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $4.2 billion compared with $5.5 billion recorded in the previous quarter. The company had long-term debt of $4.5 billion compared with $6.3 billion reported in the last reported quarter.The company generated cash flow of $2 billion from operational activities during the first half of fiscal 2018. HP repurchased shares worth $1.3 billion and paid dividends worth $457 million, during the same time frame.GuidanceBuoyed by improving market share across the PC and Printer businesses, HP raised its non-GAAP earnings guidance for fiscal 2018. The company now estimates non-GAAP earnings to lie between $1.97 and $2.02, up from the earlier guidance of $1.90 and $2.00.On the cost front, the company anticipates that overall component and logistic costs for Personal Systems will escalate throughout fiscal 2018. Moreover, from the beginning of the fiscal second quarter, the company has been witnessing rise in material costs in the Printing segment, which are expected to continue flaring up in the second half of the fiscal too.Coming to the fiscal third quarter, HP projects non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations in the range of 49-52 cents per share.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended upward during the past month. There have been three revisions higher for the current quarter.HP Inc. Price and Consensus  HP Inc. Price and Consensus | HP Inc. QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, HPQ has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with a C. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is primarily suitable for value investors while also being suitable for those looking for growth and to a lesser degree momentum.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising.

2755,HPQ,"HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) recently announced that it is launching a production-graded 3D printing center in China in collaboration with Guangdong (Dali) 3D Printing Collaborative Innovation Platform.Notably, this is HP’s largest production-grade 3D printing facility in the Asia Pacific. Powered by Guangdong Lanwan Intelligence Technology, this HP Multi Jet Fusion Technology Mass Manufacturing Center is equipped with 10 printing systems to address the surge in demand for production related parts and prototypes, maintaining the quality and speed of production.The opening of this center seems to be in line with the company’s announcements in June last year regarding strengthening of its 3D Printing technologies in the Asia-Pacific region. Since the manufacturing sector of the region is worth more than $6 trillion, the expansion decision seems prudent.HP is focusing on enhancing its 3D printing business capabilities. Even though HP has been operating in this space for almost five years now, the company lags behind 3D Systems Corporation (DDD  -  Free Report) and Stratasys Ltd. (SSYS  -  Free Report). These initiatives are expected to aid HP make its mark in the 3D printing industry.Unlike 3D Systems and Stratasys, which target all kinds of consumers, HP emphasizes only on industrial markets because of their ability to afford a premium range of 3D printing solutions. The company has collaborations with BMW, Nike, Autodesk and Jabil Circuit Inc.(JBL  -  Free Report) among others, which have contributed to the company’s top line.Notably, HP’s revenues climbed 13% year over year to $14 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, with the Printing segment contributing $5.2 billion.HP Inc.

2756,HPQ,"HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report), yesterday, in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), announced that its board of directors has approved a new share repurchase authorization of $4 billion. However, management stated that the timing and number of shares to be bought will depend upon prevailing market conditions and other factors.The latest approval is in addition to the company’s existing authorization, wherein approximately $1.2 billion worth balance remaining as of Apr 30, 2018.This apart, management also announced a quarterly cash dividend of 13.93 cents per share to be paid on Oct 3 to shareholders of record date as of Sep 12, 2018.HP has a steady track record of returning value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payouts. The company, since its split from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report), has returned approximately $2 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividend payments.The company’s strong balance sheet and cash flow provide it with the financial flexibility to undertake shareholder-friendly initiatives, and scope for product innovation and expansion in newer markets. The company ended second-quarter fiscal 2018 with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of nearly $4.25 billion and generated more than $2 billion of cash flows from operating activities in the first half of the fiscal.Some other companies that have a consistent track record of returning value through share repurchases and dividend payments include Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report).We believe such initiatives not only enhance shareholders’ return, but also raise the market value of a stock. Through share repurchases and dividend payouts, companies boost investors’ confidence, persuading them to either buy or hold the scrip. Looking ahead, HP remains confident on its growth potential, thereby raising hope for further improvement in shareholder value.HP Inc. Price HP Inc. Price | HP Inc.

2757,HPQ,"Shares of Tech Data Corp. (TECD  -  Free Report) rose 6.7% since the release of first-quarter fiscal 2019 results on May 31. Although earnings deteriorated 1.6% on a year-over-year basis, investors were encouraged by a bottom-line beat after a miss in the preceding quarter. Further, sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fifth straight quarter. On top of it, a solid second-quarter guidance buoys optimism.As a result, the company’s shares have gained 11.5%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 9.8% in the past month.We believe that Tech Data is positioning itself well to achieve strong growth based on increasing demand for data center systems, cloud and mobility offerings in the long run. The company’s efforts to diversify into new domains are significantly positive. The higher level of spending in these areas is expected to drive revenue growth for Tech Data as the company consolidates its position in the fast-growing domain of data center, mobile technology, software and integrated supply chain. A Brief Synopsis of Q1Tech Data, which shares space with PC Connection, Inc. (CNXN  -  Free Report), reported first-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.84 per share, which not only exceeded its own expectation of $1.30-$1.60 but also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.48. Notably, the company has exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in five of the trailing seven quarters.Revenues of $8,548 million increased 21.7% year over year and beat the consensus mark of $8,183 million, driven by favorable foreign currency exchange rates and an additional month of Technology Solutions' (""TS"") sales.  Net sales rose 13% on a constant-currency basis.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company generated 14% of sales in the quarter from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report). HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) and Cisco represented 12% and 11% of net sales, respectively.For the fiscal second quarter, Tech Data forecasts net sales of $8.6-$8.9 billion compared with $8.9 billion reported in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.Adjusted earnings per share are anticipated in the band of $1.95-$2.25 compared with $174 in the year-ago period.Factors That Could Limit Growth PotentialAlthough, gross profit increased 14% to $523.1 million in the fiscal first quarter, gross margin contracted 39 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 6.1%. Adjusted operating margin contracted 30 bps to 1.5%.We are concerned about aggressive industry pricing in the indirect channel, which has intensified, resulting in lower gross margins and more competitive conditions. This apart, low growth and margin of the tech distribution business can also be a drag on the company’s financials.

2762,HPQ,"HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) delivered another quarter of stellar performance wherein its revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while earnings matched the same. Moreover, the company’s revenues increased for the seventh consecutive quarter, out of which the last six recorded double-digit growth after a prolonged period of decline. Also, the Personal Systems and Print segments’ performance improved for the fifth straight quarter, after 2010.In fact, the company’s outstanding results for the last few quarters substantiate that the spin-off from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report), along with its diligent restructuring initiatives, is finally paying off.HP’s total revenues climbed 13% year over year to $14 billion and outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.6 billion. The better-than-expected top-line performance was driven mainly by strength in the Personal System and Printing segments, as well as successful product roll outs.The company’s bottom-line results were also impressive, wherein its non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of 48 cents per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, and came toward the higher-end of management’s guided range of 45-49 cents. On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP earnings improved 20%. The robust bottom-line performance was mainly backed by higher revenues and lower share counts.HP Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise HP Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | HP Inc. QuoteQuarter in DetailThe Personal Systems segment generated revenues of $8.8 billion, up 14% year over year, mainly driven by strong demand for high-end products and a 7% rise in prices.  While commercial revenues increased 16%, consumer revenues were up 10%.We believe the spin-off from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, and restructuring initiatives, such as focus on product innovations, pricing, marketing and sales activities, are ultimately paying off.Notably, International Data Corporation (IDC), in its latest report on first-quarter 2018 PC shipment, stated that this quarter marked the eighth consecutive quarter of overall shipment growth for HP.Coming to the Printing business, the segment’s revenues were up 11% year over year to $5.2 billion, primarily stemming from an 8% increase in supplies revenues and inclusion of the recently-acquired business of Samsung’s printing (S-Print) business. It should be noted that the buyout of S-Print has helped HP in the $55-billion high-end copy-machine market where Xerox Corporation (XRX  -  Free Report) is currently the leader.HP’s total hardware unit sales grew 13%, backed by the Consumer hardware unit’s increase of 4% and the Commercial hardware unit’s year-over-year growth of 88%. The robust growth in Commercial hardware units chiefly stemmed from the recent inclusion of S-Print business.Region wise, the company registered double-digit growth in every region it operates. Revenues from Americas were up 7% year over year. While revenues from Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) climbed 21%, the same from the Asia Pacific and Japan region jumped 13% year over year.Gross margin expanded 10 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 19.3%. This was primarily supported by increased pricing and improved mix in the Personal Systems segment, which more than offset elevated component costs, particularly the NAND flash chips.Non-GAAP operating expenses flared up 16% year over year to $1.7 billion. This was mainly due to the inclusion of the S-Print business, and increased investment in research and development, as well as go-to-market sales strategies.Non-GAAP operating margin from continuing operations remained flat year over year at 7%, as benefit from improved gross margin was fully offset by elevated operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. HP’s non-GAAP net income from continuing operations came in at $798 million compared with $685 million reported a year ago.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowHP ended the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $4.2 billion compared with $5.5 billion recorded in the previous quarter. The company had long-term debt of $4.5 billion compared with $6.3 billion reported in the last reported quarter.The company generated cash flow of $2 billion from operational activities during the first half of fiscal 2018. HP repurchased shares worth $1.3 billion and paid dividends worth $457 million, during the same time frame.GuidanceBuoyed by improving market share across the PC and Printer businesses, HP raised its non-GAAP earnings guidance for fiscal 2018. The company now estimates non-GAAP earnings to lie between $1.97 and $2.02, up from the earlier guidance of $1.90 and $2.00. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.93.On the cost front, the company anticipates that overall component and logistic costs for Personal Systems will escalate throughout fiscal 2018. Moreover, from the beginning of the fiscal second quarter, the company has been witnessing rise in material costs in the Printing segment, which are expected to continue flaring up in the second half of the fiscal too.Coming to the fiscal third quarter, HP projects non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations in the range of 49-52 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 49 cents.Our TakeWe are impressed by the performance of HP’s PC segment, wherein the year-over-year increase can be attributed to growth in Commercial and Consumer revenues. Additionally, the company’s efforts to turn around its business have been commendable. Meanwhile, it has been working on product innovation, differentiation and enhancing the capabilities of its printing business to stabilize the top line.The latest PC shipment data by IDC indicates that HP’s restructuring initiatives, including focus on product innovations, pricing, marketing and sales activities, divestment of non-core assets and cutting jobs to lower costs, are paying off gradually. Per the data compiled by IDC, the company witnessed year-over-year shipment growth for the seventh quarter in a row, after witnessing declines for five consecutive quarters.With the commencement of the shipping of A3 multifunction printers to more than 80 countries, which covers all its key markets, HP is likely to revive the company’s printing business and grab a bigger share in the inkjet printer market. Also, the acquisition of Samsung’s printing business is anticipated to support the development and manufacturing of printers.Nonetheless, prices of components such as DRAM and NAND are likely to remain high in 2018, which will continue to drag down the company’s margins. Although the company’s strategic efforts are driving top-line growth, those might not be enough to offset this incremental cost.Moreover, competition from the likes of Lenovo, Dell and Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) is another key concern.HP currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2763,HPQ,"Viasat Inc.  rolled out the fastest satellite internet available in the United States, powered by the new ViaSat-2 satellite system. The company is offering streaming and download speeds of up to 100 Mbps to subscribers along with unlimited data plans for video streaming.The service is aimed at households that are outside the reach of cable systems (10-30 million households in the United States). These consumers have limited options for high-speed Internet service, with DSL being the most common choice. However, DSL speeds typically top out at 25 megabits per second.In essence, Viasat is offering its service as a higher-speed alternative to DSL. Viasat’s new plans start at 12 megabits per second, at an initial cost of $50 per month. Consumers can scale up to 25 megabits for $70 per month, 50 megabits for $100 per month and 100 megabits for $150 a month. Each of the plans offer unlimited data, which allows roughly 150 gigabits of video streaming and other consumption per month.If a user exceeds the data limits and the network is crowded, they may experience slower speeds. However, Viasat insisted that it will not charge overage fees.The new plans are powered by ViaSat-2, a $625-million high-capacity satellite launched by the company in June 2017. The satellite also powers fast in-flight Wi-Fi for JetBlue, American Airlines, United Airlines and other commercial carriers and government customers. ViaSat-2 satellite system provides service to North America, Central America, the Caribbean and a small part of northern South America.ViaSat-2 is expected to have twice the bandwidth and seven times more broadband coverage, and is a massive improvement over ViaSat-1. Some other features which make it more powerful than ViaSat-1 include high-capacity connectivity, smaller gateway antenna and twice as many gateways. Viasat believes that these advanced smaller gateways can help it place the latest satellites in proximity of popular Internet access points, delivering greater network reliability and security.Viasat is already building its next-generation high-capacity satellite system — ViaSat-3 — which is expected to expand its network worldwide.The satellite business is a burgeoning space and is one of the fastest growing segments of the $350-billion space industry. Significant demand for higher speeds of broadband connectivity in residential, in-flight and government markets are likely to accelerate Viasat’s growth momentum in the near term.In recent quarters, Viasat’s earnings have suffered due to R&D expenses. The primary dampeners are the ViaSat-3 payload, pre-flight development and testing, commercial in-flight connectivity, STCs and line-fit activity. This indicates that we can expect more pressure on profits in the upcoming quarters. Viasat’s shares have gained just 4% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 18.2%.Revenue growth in the fiscal third quarter was strained due to capacity constraints. Also, the costs related to the ViaSat-2 service launch activities and preparations for the large-scale in-flight Wi-Fi ramp are expected to burden the bottom line in the coming quarters. The company also predicts heavier advertising activity over the next several quarters, which will raise costs and hurt margins.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderViasat carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space include HP Inc.

2766,HPQ,"HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) delivered another quarter of stellar performance. The company reported better-than-expected results for first-quarter fiscal 2018. Its revenues increased for the sixth consecutive quarter, of which the last five have recorded double-digit growth after an extended period of decline. Also, the Personal Systems and Print segments’ performance improved for the fourth straight quarter after 2010.In fact, the company’s outstanding results for the last few quarters substantiate that the spin-off from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report), along with its diligent restructuring initiatives, is finally paying off.HP’s total revenues increased 15% year over year to $14.517 billion and outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.432 billion. The better-than-expected top-line performance was driven mainly by strength in the Personal System and Printing segments as well as successful product roll outs.The company’s bottom-line results were also impressive, wherein its non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of 48 cents per share came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 42 cents as well as management’s earlier guidance range of 42-45 cents. On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP earnings improved 26%.Apart from higher revenues, the company’s bottom-line results benefited from lower effective tax rate due to the U.S. tax reform. HP noted that its fiscal first-quarter effective tax rate came in at 15% which is against its previous projection of 21-22%, resulting in a benefit of 4 cents per share.HP’s shares are up nearly 6% in today’s pre-market trading session. The upswing stemmed from the company’s upbeat second-quarter and fiscal 2018 non-GAAP earnings guidance.Notably, the stock has outperformed the industry in the last one year. While the stock has rallied 21.2%, the industry has recorded 15.8% growth.Quarter in DetailThe Personal Systems segment generated revenues of $9.440 billion, up 15% year over year.  While commercial revenues increased 16%, consumer revenues were up 13%. We believe the spin-off from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, and restructuring initiatives, such as focus on product innovations, pricing, marketing and sales activities, are ultimately apparently paying off.Notably, International Data Corporation (IDC), in its latest report on fourth-quarter 2017 PC shipment, stated that the quarter marked the seventh consecutive quarter of overall shipment growth for HP.Talking about only the U.S. market, it is only HP which recorded growth in PC shipments as well as improvement in market share. According to data compiled by Gartner (IT  -  Free Report), the quarter ended on Dec 31, 2017, was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment growth for the company in the U.S. market.Coming to the Printing business, this segment’s revenues were up 14% year over year to $5.076 billion, primarily owing to a 10% increase in supplies revenues and inclusion of the first full quarter of the newly acquired business of Samsung’s printing (S-Print) business. HP expects that the acquisition of the S-Print business will bring in additional revenues of approximately $1.4 billion in fiscal 2018.HP’s total hardware unit sales grew 14% backed by Consumer hardware units increase of 7% and Commercial hardware unit’s year-over-year growth of 73%. The robust growth in Commercial hardware units primarily stemmed from the recent inclusion of Samsung’s printing (S-Print) business.Region wise, the company registered double-digit growth in every region it operates. Revenues from Americas were up 10% year over year. While revenues from Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) climbed 13%, the same from the Asia Pacific and Japan region jumped 18% year over year, all in constant currency.Gross margin expanded 10 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 17.8%, primarily driven by better margin in the printing segment driven by improved productivity and higher supplies mix. This was partially offset by elevated commodity costs of Personal Systems.Non-GAAP operating expenses flared up 17% year over year to $1.6 billion. This was mainly due to the inclusion of S-Print business, and increased investment in research and development as well as go-to-market sales strategies.Non-GAAP operating margin from continuing operations remained flat year over year at 7% as the benefit from improved gross margin were fully offset by elevated operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. HP’s non-GAAP net income from continuing operations came in at $803 million compared with $646 million reported a year ago.HP Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise HP Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | HP Inc. QuoteBalance Sheet and Cash FlowHP ended the fiscal first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $5.475 billion compared with $6.997 billion recorded in the previous quarter. The company had long-term debt of $6.340 billion compared with $6.747 billion reported in the last quarter.The company generated cash flow of $996 million from operational activities during the quarter. HP repurchased shares worth $462 million and paid dividends worth $230 million during the same time frame.GuidanceThe company, during its conference call, noted that due to implementation of the new tax code, its effective cost rate for fiscal 2018 is likely to be 16% (+/- 2%), much lower than the previous projection of 21-22%, thereby benefiting HP’s non-GAAP earnings per share by 13 cents. However, the company stated that “higher variable performance bonus opportunities for non-executives” will result in dilution of approximately 3 cents toward non-GAAP earnings.Therefore, the net benefit from lower effective tax rate will be around 10 cents, of which it has already earned in the fiscal first quarter. So, the remaining three quarters are likely to see a tax benefit of 2 cents each.Keeping the aforementioned factor, along with improving market share across the PC and Printer businesses, HP raised its non-GAAP earnings guidance for fiscal 2018. The company now estimates non-GAAP earnings to lie between $1.90 and $2.00 (mid-point $1.95), up from the earlier guidance range of $1.75-$1.85 (mid-point $1.80). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.81.For the fiscal second quarter, HP projects non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations in the range of 45-49 cents per share (mid-point: 47 cents). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 43 cents.Our TakeWe are impressed by the performance of HP’s PC segment, wherein the year-over-year increase can be attributed to growth in Commercial and Consumer revenues. Additionally, the company’s efforts to turn around its business have been commendable. Meanwhile, it has been working on product innovation, differentiation and enhancing the capabilities of its printing business to stabilize the top line.The latest PC shipment data by IDC depicts that HP’s restructuring initiatives, including focus on product innovations, pricing, marketing and sales activities, divestment of non-core assets and cutting jobs to lower costs, are paying off gradually. Per the data compiled by IDC, the company witnessed year-over-year shipment growth for the seventh quarter in a row, after witnessing declines for five consecutive quarters.With the start of shipping A3 multifunction printers to more than 80 countries, which covers all its key markets, HP is likely to revive the company’s printing business and grab a bigger share in the inkjet printer market. Also, the acquisition of Samsung’s printing business is anticipated to support the development and manufacturing of printers.Nonetheless, prices of components such as DRAM and NAND are likely to remain high in 2018 which will continue to drag down the company’s margins. Although the company’s strategic efforts are driving top-line growth, those might not be enough to offset this incremental cost.Moreover, competition from the likes of Lenovo, Dell and Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) remains another key concern.HP currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2767,HPQ,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 22. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this IT solution-providing company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, Hewlett Packard Enterprise has delivered positive earnings surprises in the last two quarters. So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderThe acquisition of EMC Corporation (stylized as EMC) by Dell has been posing new challenges for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. With this acquisition, Dell has become one of the major players in the cloud services and data-storage market. EMC offers data storage, information security, virtualization, analytics, cloud computing, and other products and services that enable businesses to store, manage, protect, and analyze data.Additionally, VMware (VMW  -  Free Report) was EMC’s subsidiary that focuses on cloud and virtualization software and services for its parent company. Therefore, the acquisition of EMC, along with its privately-controlled structure, will provide Dell an unmatched scale, strength and flexibility to deepen its relationships with customers of all sizes.Apart from this, it also seems that Hewlett Packard Enterprise is losing market share to Dell in the server shipment. Notably, according to IDC, during third-quarter 2017, Dell managed to drastically narrow down the server shipment market-share difference with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, chiefly benefiting from “the strong synergy between its server team and the storage team incorporated from the EMC acquisition”.This happened mainly because Hewlett Packard Enterprise is now focusing on enterprise market and “pivoting away” from the firm’s hyperscaler business, which has been denting its short-term revenues. We believe this strategy will hurt Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s to-be-reported quarter’s revenues.Since its split from HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report), Hewlett Packard Enterprise has been focusing on restructuring and realigning the company’s businesses to drive long-term sustainable growth and improvise margins. In doing so, the company has spun-off its Software and Enterprise Services business. The spin-offs will surely result in an unfavorable year-over-year comparison, which means disappointing top- as well bottom-line results for the fiscal first quarter.Moreover, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, in its previous earnings conference calls, had hinted that the company might continue to shrink with spin-offs. However, in our opinion, the company’s contrarian strategy might be in the right direction but the turnaround is still far behind as we haven’t seen any significant improvement in the recently-reported financial results. We also consider that the company is still struggling to determine its true business focus.Also, we consider that the company’s to-be-reported quarterly results will bear the brunt of the three main challenges it is currently facing — competitive pricing, heightened commodities pricing pressure and some dilution from M&A. These headwinds are expected to thwart its overall performance in the near term.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Hewlett Packard Enterprise is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Hewlett Packard Enterprise currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. Notably, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 23 cents, representing a year-over-year plunge of 48.9%. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $7.03 billion, down a massive 38.4% from the year-ago quarter.Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price and EPS Surprise Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price and EPS Surprise | Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company QuoteA Stock With Favorable CombinationHere is a company which, as per our model, has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Analog Devices, Inc.

2769,HPQ,"HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 29. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether or not the leading global PC manufacturer will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter.The company’s last quarterly results reflected overall revenue growth for the sixth consecutive quarter, after witnessing a prolonged period of decline. Furthermore, the Personal Systems and Print segments improved for the fourth straight quarter after 2010.Notably, the company has a decent earnings surprise history. Over the trailing four quarters, the company’s results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice and came in line in one occasion. So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Notably, HP is one of the two companies which came into existence post the split from the parent company — Hewlett-Packard Company — in November 2015. The other company was Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report).What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that HP is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP, and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.It should be noted that stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) are best avoided, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.HP currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, which makes surprise prediction difficult. Furthermore, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal second-quarter earnings remained unchanged, over the past 30 days.Nonetheless, the company is expected to register year-over-year improvements in the top and bottom lines. The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects earnings per share to increase 20% to 48 cents from the year-ago quarter figure of 40 cents. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues to be up 9.7%, year over year, to $13.59 billion.HP Inc. Price and EPS Surprise HP Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | HP Inc. QuoteLet’s check out the reasons behind this year-over-year improvement projection in revenues and earnings.Revamped PC Business Bears FruitPost the split from parent company, HP adopted a strategy of focusing on product innovation & differentiation, pricing, and marketing and sales activities to spur demand for its PC products in the market. The company has launched various models under its PC product lines of EliteBook, Spectre and Pavilion Wave, over the past two years.The impact of these initiatives is well highlighted by the fact that the company has regained the pole position in the PC segment. Also, according to data compiled by International Data Corporation (“IDC”), during first-quarter 2018, the company’s PC shipment registered the eighth straight quarter of year-over-year growth after witnessing several quarters of decline.HP’s efforts to turn around the business have been commendable and seem to be on track, as indicated by its performance over the last few quarters. We believe benefits of the aforementioned initiatives will have positively impacted the to-be-reported quarterly results as well.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the PC segment is anticipated to have generated revenues of approximately $8.4 billion in the fiscal second quarter, reflecting 9.6% year-over-year growth.Print Segment Playing WellThe company’s efforts to revamp its printing business have also been impressive. It should be noted that HP has acquired Samsung Electronics’ printer business. The acquisition is a strategic fit for HP as it expanded the company’s printing business, with the addition of 6,500-plus printing patents owned by Samsung.In addition to the above, the company is now focused on fortifying its 3D printing business capabilities. However, unlike 3D Systems (DDD  -  Free Report) and Stratasys (SSYS  -  Free Report), which target all kinds of consumers, HP is emphasizing only on industrial markets due to their ability to afford a premium range of 3D printing solutions. It should be noted that even though HP has been operating in this space for almost five years now, it still lags behind 3D Systems and Stratasys.Nonetheless, these efforts have paid off well, with the company registering the fourth consecutive quarter of print-business revenue growth in first-quarter fiscal 2018. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the Print segment is projected to have churned revenues of approximately $5.12 billion in the quarter to be reported, reflecting 7.9% year-over-year improvement.Escalating Component Prices Impeding ProfitabilityHP’s product innovation, differentiation, marketing and pricing strategies are paying off as evident from the year-over-year jump in PC segment revenues and shipments for the past few quarters. Nevertheless, escalating component costs have been marring its margins, thereby eroding the benefits of higher revenues. Prices of components, such as DRAM and NAND, are still very high and therefore, we believe this might have dampened the company’s fiscal second-quarter profitability.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2770,HPQ,"Key foreign bank earnings that are scheduled for release next week are likely to provide a better understanding of the sector’s near-term prospects. The central focus for foreign banks in the short term will be the one-time U.S. tax charges and the way it will affect their full-year profits.Additionally, several major central banks across the globe are looking to normalize their monetary policy. This, in turn, will keep the momentum alive in the foreign banking sector this year after registering a steady recovery in 2017.Further, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) global economic growth is projected to expand by 3.9% in 2018, better than the pace of 3.8% witnessed in 2017. Also, the IMF expects tax cuts in the United States to benefit the global economy in the coming months. This along with a steady growth outlook in 2018 is expected to benefit foreign banks in the long run.In this context, The Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS  -  Free Report) and Bank Of Montreal (BMO  -  Free Report) which are scheduled to report on May 29 and May 30, respectively, assume greater significance. Both foreign banks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other major stocks reporting earnings from May 28 to Jun 1 include salesforce.com, Inc. (CRM  -  Free Report) and HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report).Price PerformanceBank of Nova Scotia has gained 11.4% in the past one year, outperforming the broader industry that has moved up 6.3% over the same period. In comparison, Bank Of Montreal has not only outperformed the broader industry but is also ahead of Bank of Nova Scotia, gaining 17.3% over the same time frame.ValuationCompared with the S&P 500, the industry is clearly undervalued. This implies that the industry has upside potential for the near future. The industry has an average trailing 12-month P/B ratio – which is the best multiple for valuing banks because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next – of 1.40, which is below the S&P 500’s average of 3.86. Hence, it might be a good idea not to abstain from stocks belonging to this industry.Moreover, coming to the two stocks under consideration, with a P/B ratio of 1.67 in the last one year, Bank of Nova Scotia is clearly underpriced than both the industry and Bank Of Montreal’s P/B ratio 1.68.Dividend YieldBank of Nova Scotia’s dividend yield over the last year is 4.07%, higher than the broader industry’s figure of 2.94%. With a dividend yield of 3.65%, Bank of Montreal shareholders earns a lower dividend yield than Bank of Nova Scotia.Return on Assets (ROA)Return on assets (ROA) is one of the key financial ratios for banks as they rely heavily on their assets to create revenues. A positive ROA indicates that the company has reported gains from its assets for the period in question. Coming to Bank of Nova Scotia and Bank of Montreal, ROA for the trailing 12-months (TTM) is 0.91% and 0.76%, respectively. Bank of Nova Scotia has a higher ROA than not only Bank Of Montreal, but also the industry, which has ROA of 0.54%.Earnings History, ESP and Estimate RevisionsConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history, Bank of Nova Scotia has delivered positive surprises in three of the prior four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 2.5%. On the other hand, Bank Of Montreal has witnessed positive surprises in two of the prior four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of only 0.08%, losing this round to its rival.Both foreign banks have an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. At the same time, the earnings estimate for the current year has increased by 0.6% Bank of Nova Scotia’s over the last 60 days but has declined for Bank Of Montreal by 0.3%. ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that Bank of Montreal holds an edge over Bank of Nova Scotia when considering only price performance. However, when considering the return on assets, valuations and dividend yield, Bank of Nova Scotia holds an edge over Bank of Montreal.Additionally, when we take a more comprehensive look at the companies’ previous earnings performance and estimate revisions, Bank of Nova Scotia is clearly the better stock. In this respect, it is evident that Bank of Nova Scotia holds a clear edge over Bank of Montreal ahead of their earnings releases next week.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2771,HPQ,"Maintaining its earnings streak for the 12th straight quarter, NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) reported splendid first-quarter fiscal 2019 results, wherein it not only marked strong year-over-year improvement but also trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company's results also beat estimates on all fronts.Despite this, shares of NVIDIA lost nearly 3% in after-hour trade as the company foresees decelerated demand for crypto-specific GPUs in the quarters ahead, making investors slightly cautious.The company provided crypto-specific revenues data from the first time which came in at $289 million. However, for the current quarter, it predicts revenues from this business to take a hit and be about one-third of the first-quarter level.Let’s now discuss the quarterly report.RevenuesRevenues not only surged 66% year over year to $3.21 billion but also comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.91 billion as well as management’s projection of $2.90 billion (+/-2%). The year-over-year improvement was primarily backed by growth across all platforms — GPUs for gaming, Professional Visualization, datacenter and Tegra automotive. Further, NVIDIA continued to gain traction in the artificial intelligence (AI) space which proved conducive to quarterly revenues.Revenues at the GPU business jumped 77% year over year to $2.77 billion on strength in GeForce GPUs for Gaming and datacenter. Strong demand for cryptocurrencies stemmed from increased adoption of Bitcoin and latest digital currencies like Ethereum also helped bump up demand for GPU, thereby driving GPU sales. Moreover, the Nintendo (NTDOY  -  Free Report) Switch, which was launched in March 2017, contributed to overall growth.Tegra processor revenues totaled $442 million, up 33% on a year-over-year basis. The increase was primarily buoyed by better-than-expected growth in Tegra development services.Revenues at Gaming GPU were up 68% on a year-over-year basis to $1.72 billion on the back of demand across all regions and form factors.The company’s continued focus on introducing fast and innovative products as well as agreements with leading PC game makers has been driving the Gaming GPU business. During the reported quarter, NVIDIA unveiled real-time ray tracing technology, NVIDIA RTX which is likely to take gaming experience to a whole new level. Hence, the product launch will help NVIDIA expand its customer base and in turn drive additional revenues.During the CES 2018 event, the company rolled out a hardware “big format gaming displays, or BFGDs” in collaboration with HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report), Asus and Acer to reach phenomenal gaming experience to an enormous screen of 65 inches.According to the company, BFGDs put together “a high-end 65-inch, 4K 120Hz HDR display with NVIDIA G-SYNC technology together with NVIDIA SHIELD, the world’s most advanced streaming device.” NVIDIA says that the combination of these technologies will give users a ""buttery-smooth gaming experience"" as well as enable them to stream their favorite streaming applications such as Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), Gaming Video, YouTube and Hulu.Meanwhile, revenues from datacenter increased 71% year over year to $701 million, mainly fueled by strong adoption of AI, deep learning, high-performance computing (HPC) and strong traction of the new Volta architecture.The company’s Volta-based V100 accelerator hogged the maximum limelight. The Volta architecture GPU provides 5 times more deep learning power to the company’s GPU predecessor, Pascal. NVIDIA’s Volta GPUs saw strong adoption across the globe over the past year and per the company, every major cloud provider and server maker including Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent, Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet and Microsoft are using this.Demand for NVIDIA’s AI supercomputer remained high as more organizations are keen on building AI-enabled applications.Growing traction of AI among other vertical industries like transportation, energy, manufacturing, smart cities, and healthcare is also benefiting NVIDIA. Notably, more than 1,200 companies are using this inference platform, including Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Alibaba, Baidu, Hi Vision and Tencent.Automotive revenues in the reported quarter totaled $145 million, reflecting an increase of 4% year over year.At CES 2018, the company announced a number of contracts in the self-driving space with the likes of Uber, Volkswagen, Aurora, Baidu and ZF Friedrichshafen AG. During the fiscal first-quarter conference call, NVIDIA noted that over “370 companies and research institutions” are using its Drive platform.Moving to Professional Visualization, revenues increased 22% year over year to $251 million on elevated demand for real-time rendering tools like AR and VR.MarginsNVIDIA’s non-GAAP gross margin expanded 510 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 64.7%, which exceeded management’s guidance of 63% (+/-50 bps).In dollar terms, non-GAAP gross profit came in at $2.08 billion, reflecting an increase of 79.9% from the year-ago quarter, primarily on the back of strength in value-added platforms.Non-GAAP operating expenses swelled around 25.3% from the year-earlier quarter to $648 million due to higher investment in growth areas, including gaming, AI and self-driving cars. Non-GAAP operating expenses were slightly higher than the company’s projection of $645 million. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses, however, contracted to 20.2% from 26.7% in the year-ago quarter.Consequently, NVIDIA’s non-GAAP operating margin was up from 32.9% to 44.5% in the quarter under review. In dollar terms, non-GAAP operating income jumped from $637 million to $1.43 billion.Non-GAAP net income during the quarter came in at $1.29 billion as compared with $533 million a year ago. On per share basis, the company’s non-GAAP earnings came at $2.05 compared with 85 cents posted in the year-ago quarter. Quarterly earnings also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.65.NVIDIA Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise NVIDIA Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | NVIDIA Corporation QuoteBalance Sheet & Cash FlowNVIDIA exited the fiscal first quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $7.30 billion compared with $7.11 billion in the previous quarter. NVIDIA’s long-term debt was $1.99 billion. Free cash flow during the quarter came in at $1.33 billion, while cash flow from operations was $1.45 billion. During the quarter, the company returned approximately $746 million in the form of share repurchases and dividend payouts.GuidanceThe company issued its outlook for second-quarter fiscal 2019. For the quarter, NVIDIA expects revenues of $3.10 billion (+/-2%), much higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.97 billion.Non-GAAP gross margin is projected at 63.5% (+/-50 bps). Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected at $685 million. Both GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are projected at 11% (+/-1%).For fiscal 2019, the company expects to return $1.25 billion to shareholders in the form of cash dividends and share buybacks.Bottom LineNVIDIA posted a stellar first quarter and provided encouraging second-quarter fiscal 2019 revenue guidance. Also, the company registered year-over-year growth on both the counts, primarily stemming from growth across all four platforms. Also, higher-than-anticipated demand for its gaming chips helped drive the encouraging results.Furthermore, we believe NVIDIA’s innovative product pipeline and strength in gaming and high-end notebook GPUs keep it well positioned. We also expect higher adoption of NVIDIA’s Volta processors to act as a catalyst in the near term.Moreover, although NVIDIA predicts a slowdown in crypto-specific GPUs revenues, we believe this will have not any material impact on its financials. The company foresees demand for its GPUs to shift from miners to gamers in the near term, which will boost gaming business revenues.The stock has been clocking solid returns for the past year and has soared a whopping 105.7%, outperforming the industry's gain of 61.8%. NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2773,HPQ,"Continuing its earnings streak for the 11th straight quarter, NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) reported splendid fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein it not only marked a strong year-over-year improvement, but also came way ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company's results also beat its estimates on all the fronts.This California-based graphic chip behemoth posted earnings of $1.72 per share on a non-GAAP basis, up nearly 52% year over year. Non-GAAP earnings also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimates of $1.16. The year-over year robust bottom-line performance mainly stemmed from significant revenue growth, along with gross margin and operating margin expansion.Aided by these factors, shares of NVIDIA were up nearly 9% during today’s pre-market trade. Moreover, the stock has been clocking solid returns for the past year and has soared a whopping 91.4%, outperforming the industry's gain of 41.6%. RevenuesRevenues not only surged 34% year over year to $2.911 billion, but also comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.669 billion, as well as management’s projection of $2.65 billion (+/-2%). The year-over-year jump is primarily attributable to growth across all the platforms, that is, the GPUs gaming platform, Professional Visualization, datacenter and Tegra automotive platforms. Further, NVIDIA continued to gain strength in the artificial intelligence (AI) space, which proved conducive to quarterly revenue growth.Revenues from the GPU business jumped 33% year over year to $2.46 billion, driven by strength in GeForce GPUs Gaming revenues and datacenter. Increasing demand for cryptocurrencies stemming from increased adoption of Bitcoin and latest digital currencies like Ethereum also helped lift demand for GPU, consequently contributing to the company’s GPU sales growth. Moreover, the Nintendo (NTDOY  -  Free Report) Switch which was launched in March 2017, contributed to overall growth.Tegra processor revenues came in at $450 million, which climbed 75% on a year-over-year basis. The increase was primarily due to better-than-expected growth in Tegra development services.Revenues from Gaming GPU were up 29% on a year-over-year basis to $1.74 billion. Strong growth was primarily due to demand across all regions and form factors.The company’s continued focus on introducing fast and innovative products, as well as entering into agreements with leading PC game makers, has been driving its Gaming GPU business. During the reported quarter, NVIDIA unveiled a GPU, Titan Xp. We believe this will take gaming experience to a new level. Hence, the launch of this product will enable NVIDIA to increase its customer base and help garner additional revenues.The company, during the CES 2018 event, rolled out a hardware “big format gaming displays, or BFGDs” in collaboration with HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report), Asus and Acer, to bring in enormous gaming experience on a very big screen — 65 inches.According to the company, BFGDs put together “a high-end 65-inch, 4K 120Hz HDR display with NVIDIA G-SYNC technology together with NVIDIA SHIELD, the world’s most advanced streaming device.” NVIDIA says that combination of these technologies will give users a ""buttery-smooth gaming experience"" as well as enable them to stream their favorite streaming applications such as Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), Gaming Video, YouTube and Hulu.Additionally, revenues from datacenter more than doubled when compared with the year-ago quarter and came in at $606 million, mainly fueled by strong adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning, high-performance computing (HPC), and strong traction of the new Volta architecture.The company’s Volta-based V100 accelerator was the most significant launch. The Volta V100 GPU provides 10 times more deep learning power to the company’s older predecessor, Pascal generation GPUs. NVIDIA’s Volta GPUs has seen strong adoption across all over the world over the past year with companies including Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent, Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet and Microsoft in the list.Demand for NVIDIA’s AI supercomputer also remained high as more organizations are keen on building AI-enabled applications. The company stated that the U.S. Department of Energy's Summit System and Japan’s ABCI system have agreed to use NVIDIA’s GPUs in building AI supercomputers.Growing traction of AI among other vertical industries like “transportation, energy, manufacturing, smart cities, and healthcare” is also benefiting NVIDIA. During the last quarter, the company secured several contracts from companies such as GE Health, Nuance and Baker Hughes for implementing AI. Notably more than 1,200 companies are already using this inference platform, including Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Alibaba, Baidu, Hi Vision and Tencent.Automotive revenues for the reported quarter came in at $132 million, reflecting an increase of 3% year over year. The company continued by entering into new partnerships based on its DRIVE PX AI platform.At CES 2018, the company announced several contracts in the self-driving space with companies like Uber, Volkswagen, Aurora, Baidu and ZF Friedrichshafen AG. During the fiscal fourth-quarter conference call, NVIDIA noted that more than “320 companies and research institutions” are using its Drive platform, which represents 50% year-over-year growth.Moving to Professional Visualization, revenues from Quadro increased 13% year over year and came in at $254 million. The increase was mainly due to elevated demand in real-time rendering tools like AR and VR.MarginsNVIDIA’s non-GAAP gross margin expanded 190 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 62.1%, which exceeded the management’s guidance range of 60% (+/-50 bps).In dollar terms, non-GAAP gross profit came in at $1.809 billion, reflecting an increase of 38% from the year-ago quarter, primarily on the back of strength in its value-added platforms.Non-GAAP operating expenses flared up nearly 22% from the year-ago quarter to $607 million due to higher investment in growth areas, including Gaming, AI and self-driving cars. Non-GAAP operating expenses were slightly higher than the company’s projection of approximately $600 million. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses, however, decreased to 20.9% from 22.9% witnessed in the year-ago quarter.Consequently, NVIDIA’s non-GAAP operating margin was up from 37.2% to 41.3% during the reported quarter. In dollar terms, non-GAAP operating income jumped from $809 million to $1.202 billion.Non-GAAP net income during the quarter came in at $1.081 billion as compared with $704 million reported in the year-ago quarter.NVIDIA Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise NVIDIA Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | NVIDIA Corporation QuoteBalance Sheet & Cash FlowNVIDIA exited the fiscal fourth quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $7.108 billion compared with $6.320 billion in the previous quarter.

2774,HPQ,"Among the top news for last week (other than CES) were senators calling for a probe into Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) CEO Krazanich’s stock sale, Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) making material changes to its newsfeed that can impact its content and lower its revenue and HP (HPQ  -  Free Report) returning as the leading computer vendor. Here are the details- Senators Want to Probe Krzanich Chip SaleIntel’s CEO is up for some scrutiny from regulators. Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat and Senator John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican have sent letters to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Justice Department voicing their concerns about his Nov 29 stock sale and requesting them to examine whether there was any violation of insider trading laws. Intel has said that the stock sale was prescheduled, in line with the SEC’s 10b5-1 rule, but it is cooperating with any probe into the matter.Intel is facing class action lawsuits in California, Indiana and Oregon, but it may be hard to prove that Krzanich had the information and acted on it, despite the fact that Google informed the company several months prior to the scheduled sale. Moreover, security experts believe that the vulnerabilities need to be material to Intel’s business for insider trading to take place.And Intel has already said that it doesn’t expect the impact to be material. In fact, the company was going to announce the vulnerability along with the fix on Jan 9 and things may have gone according to plan if not for leaks, according to Bloomberg.The unusual size and timing of the transaction is however drawing some attention. In the last 2-3 years, Krzanich has reportedly been selling not more than 80K shares at monthly or quarterly intervals but in this case he sold more than 245K after liquidating all his options, yielding 644K shares (last year, he got the biggest payout of performance-based shares since at least 2012). Also, in 2015, 2016 and 2017, his sales instructions were issued in February, April and June, so October (in this case) was a deviation.As far as customer deviation to Intel competitors is concerned, it appears that the switching cost and complexities make it difficult, particularly for cloud providers. So Intel’s data center business is unlikely to disappear overnight. Besides, companies like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) have already updated their systems to secure them. There remains some issue with customers using older versions of Intel chips, but the company says it is working to fix those as well.The Oregonian has also reported that Intel has formed a cybersecurity group headed by Intel human resources chief Leslie Culberstone, joined by Intel VP Steve Smith and reassigned several top executives to the new organization, but Intel declined to comment on the news.Moreover, chips from Intel rivals also have the Spectre vulnerability although Intel is also affected by Meltdown. Microsoft’s patch for AMD devices caused them to freeze and the companies are looking for a workaround. ARM has said that around 5% of its chips are impacted. NVIDIA has said that its GPUs are immune although it has issued software patches for its drivers because they interact with potentially vulnerable CPUs.Facebook Makes Changes to NewsfeedFacebook is making some changes to its newsfeed that may not go down well with its content providers, advertisers and users, although management believes it will be “good for health.” So rather than posts from publications, businesses and other unpaid Facebook pages, it will be populating the newsfeed with stuff from friends and family.The quality and frequency of ads served won’t be impacted by the change. The goal is to make the platform more social and less of a place from where to catch your news. Also, posts with more reactions and likes will be promoted versus those that simply offer links for people to read or watch passively. Since businesses and publications won’t be thrilled, they could take their content elsewhere, such as YouTube for example.Engagement is also likely to drop, according to the company as the feed was earlier optimized to increase engagement and little else. So at times it may have helped the spread of fake news, or at least that’s what it’s been accused of doing. Zuckerberg has vowed to do the right thing because the fact that Facebook now reaches 2 billion users means there’s social responsibility attached.PC ShipmentsBoth IDC and Gartner are out with their fourth-quarter and full-year PC shipment estimates.Gartner, which doesn’t count Chromebooks, estimates that PC shipments fell 2.0% to 71.6 million units in the fourth quarter (the 13th straight quarterly decline) with the top 6 vendors being HP, Lenovo, Dell, Apple, Asus and Acer. Moreover, HP, Dell and Apple grew sales a respective 6.6%, 0.7% and 1.4% for market shares of 22.5%, 15.2% and 7.6%, respectively. The other vendors saw declines.IDC on the other hand saw Q4 PC shipments inch up 0.7% to 70.6 million units with the top 6 vendors also being HP, Lenovo, Dell, Apple, Asus and Acer. According to IDC however, HP, Dell and Apple grew sales a respective 8.3%, 0.7% and 7.3% for market shares of 23.5%, 15.7% and 8.2%, respectively. Lenovo’s sales were consistent with the year-ago quarter while other vendors saw declines.Market positions for the year were similar according to both research firms although Gartner places Asus fourth while IDC placed Acer fourth. HP, Dell and Apple were the only vendors that grew according to both firms.TickerPrice Change Last WeekPrice Change Last 6 MonthsAAPL+1.2%+18.4%FB-4.0%+12.3%GOOGL+1.9%+15.9%MSFT+1.6%+22.2%INTC-3.3%+25.5%CSCO+3.4%+29.7%AMZN+6.2%+29.2% Other Stories-CorporateIndia Concession to Apple: On Jan 10, the Indian government approved 100% foreign direct investment in single-brand retail without government approval (earlier, foreign companies needed approval if they owned more than 49%). This should help Apple set up its stores in India, something the company has done in every other country as part of its brand building exercise.iPhones are currently sold online  in India and will likely continue to be sold that way, but the stores could help with brand building and showcasing Apple products and experiences. But the government has stuck to its guns with respect to Apple’s demand for tax concessions including duty exemption on manufacturing and repair units, components, capital equipment and consumables for a period of 15 years.It has, in fact, recently raised customs duty on some imported components to encourage companies to manufacture in India. At the same time, Union Commerce Minister Suresh Prabhu said last week that the government is waiting for a specific proposal from Apple.UW Reality Lab Gets VR Research Funding: The University of Washington is setting up the UW Reality Lab that will focus on next-generation virtual and augmented reality technology and educate the industry's workforce. The university has now received $2 million each from Facebook, Huawei and Google for the purpose. Graduate students and undergraduates working on 3D computer vision and perception, object recognition, graphics, game science and education, distributed computing, stream processing, databases, computer architecture, and privacy and security will be part of the program.Amazon’s Israel Problems: Amazon has been aggressively targeting talent in Israeli startups, according to social media posts by several of them. The tactic has led to quite an uproar among the vibrant startup community in Israel, with some threatening to abandon AWS in protest. This shouldn’t have a material impact on Amazon, given its size and geographical breadth, but could encourage some of its bigger customers to also look elsewhere, such as the Google Cloud.  Vogels, Amazon's chief technology officer, has responded with a comment of his own: “Let me dive into this…It may be a sourcing agency vs. Amazon proper. I find that sourcing from our customers would be extremely counter-effective."" Google Cloud salesmen are also jumping into the action. One salesman messaged on LinkedIn: ""Google Cloud would love to have you — shoot me a message.""Legal/RegulatoryApple Probed in France: In response to a complaint by HOP, the consumer and environmental protection association acting on behalf of its clients that were wronged by Apple, French authorities initiated a criminal probe on Jan 5 to see if Apple resorted to “programmed obsolescence” and “deceit.” The iPhone maker recently apologized for inadvertently slowing down iPhones as a result of software changes to protect the batteries of older iPhones. The 6 and 6s were the worst affected.Apple also faces a number of lawsuits in the U.S. along the same lines including one that claimed Apple did it to encourage consumers to replace them with newer, more expensive models.EU Still Dissatisfied with Illegal Content: Five EU Commissioners met with representatives from companies including Facebook, Google, YouTube, and Twitter in Brussels to express their dissatisfaction with the pace at which illegal content, hate speech, extremist propaganda, etc were being removed from the platforms. While agreeing that the companies had stepped up efforts and were moving in the right direction, they kind of threatened to bring legislation if more wasn’t done soon.China Speaks Up on Privacy: Alibaba Group Holding’s payment affiliate Ant Financial, search firm Baidu and Beijing Bytedance Technology Co, which oversees popular news feed app Jinri Toutiao were pulled up by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) for inadequate policies relating to personal information protection. The MIIT also said that in the absence of proper policies and the violation of users’ privacy, the government would identify and severely punish technology companies.Privacy concerns have been mounting since users discovered that a feature detailing spending statistics automatically enrolled them into Alipay’s credit rating program, giving Alipay access to a wide array of user data. The program has been suspended after cyber regulators took exception to the action.  A consumer protection group is also suing Baidu for failing to properly notify users about the data it is collecting.Products/TechnologyApple to Increase Parental Controls in iPhones: Activist investor Jana Partners and the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS), one of the nation's largest public pension plans, are urging Apple to look into parents’ concerns about iPhone addiction and resultant brain damage. Apple said that it has had parental controls since 2008 that allow parents to decide what content to restrict, including apps, movies, websites, songs and books, as well as cellular data, password settings and other features.An Apple spokesman now says, ""We have new features and enhancements planned for the future, to add functionality and make these tools even more robust."" There’s a lot of wrangling about the responsibility that tech companies and parents have to protect children and some have said that it isn’t the hardware but the addictive software that affects children so that’s where the concern should lie.But it’s a little strange to buy your kid an item and then cry because it’s being used. It’s also strange to expect companies that sell addiction to find research against it.Facebook Messenger Kids for Fire Tablets: Messenger Kids, which uses parental controls to help under-13 kids communicate safely, can now be downloaded from the Amazon App Store for Fire tablets. In early December, it launched on iPad, iPhone and iPod touch. As kids get increasingly addicted to devices and communicating with each other online, a safe environment is what most parents will be looking for. So it’s entirely possible that this could set a trend, or at least encourage other technology players like Apple or Google to take care of those who cant do it for themselves.Facebook Answer to Amazon Echo Show: Facebook will showcase Portal, a video chat device at its developers conference in May, reports Cheddar. The product is expected to closely compete with Amazon Echo Show, but the report indicates a $499 price tag, which is nearly double the 7-inch touch screen Echo Show that Amazon prices at $229.99. Facebook intends to make it a habit-forming thing, not unlike other smart home speakers like Google Home and Apple HomePod.Encryption of Skype Messages: Microsoft is partnering with Edward Snowden-recommended Signal for end-to-end encrypted messaging. The feature, to be called Private Conversations, is still in beta, but once available, you can start a “private conversation” with any of your contacts to ensure that the messages are encrypted. The Signal app has been adopted by the CIA and even approved for use in the Senate last year.   Google to Vet YouTube Premium Video Content: Google Preferred has done well over the past year according to the company, even as it faced repeated embarrassments for placing brand ads next to inappropriate content involving terrorism, hate and children. Now, well ahead of Upfronts, the annual advance ad buying event held in May, people familiar with the matter have told Bloomberg that the company is planning to vet content for the higher-priced Preferred bundle. This is in addition to recently-announced precautionary measures, including a group of 10,000 human moderators and artificial intelligence software that the company will deploy to flag videos that may be inappropriate for ads.Collaborations & M&AFacebook-Sony/ATV: After signing on Universal Music, Facebook has now added Sony/ATV to the list. As a result, it will no longer require users to take down videos that include music from Universal’s or Sony’s catalog for copyright infringement. This should encourage them to share more video. Facebook is also reportedly in talks with Warner Music Group, but a deal hasn’t been announced yet. Facebook has been doing all it can to become more of a destination for video sharing and watching as it attempts to take share from Google’s YouTube and also pull in some TV ad dollars. Its Watch tab was also created for this purpose.Intel-Micron Part Ways on NAND: Intel and Micron have agreed that the third generation of their 3D NAND technology will be the last one co-developed by them for delivery in end-2018 to early 2019. After that, they will go their separate ways in order to better optimize the technology and products for their individual business needs. They are currently ramping products based on their second generation of 3D NAND (64 layer) technology. The companies will however continue to jointly develop and manufacture 3D XPoint (Optane) at the Intel-Micron Flash Technologies (IMFT) joint venture fab in Lehi, Utah, which is now entirely focused on 3D XPoint memory production.Google Buys Redux: Bloomberg reports that Google quietly bought Redux, a U.K. startup focused on technology that turns surfaces such as phone displays into speakers some time last year. It’s LinkedIn page mentioned that the company raised $5 million in Mar 2017 for work in computing, mobile, automotive and industrial controls markets and had been granted 178 patents. It’s easy to see where Google could find its core technology highly useful, as the company has already launched smart displays that can be used both as a touchscreen and for voice-based commands. More could be up its sleeve.ActiVision-Amazon Twitch: The Overwatch League, based on Activision’s hit shooter game, featuring teams from 12 cities, from London to Shanghai, will be televised in English, Korean and French on Amazon’s Twitch. The games will be free to watch and supported by advertising (its biggest sponsors will reportedly be HP and Intel). Amazon spent $970 million in 2014 to buy Twitch, which is a platform for people to broadcast themselves playing video games.Twitter, Snapchat Partner with Fox: Twenty First Century Fox’s Fox Sports will be live streaming a daily show related to the FIFA world cup tournament to be hosted at Moscow's Red Square between June 14 and July 15 on Twitter. Stories, including magazine-like editions called Publisher Stories will be produced by Fox along with match day highlights for Snapchat. Snapchat will also produce FIFA World Cup ""Our Stories,"" featuring video highlights of goals and other key moments provided by Fox Sports.Some NumbersSMBs On Amazon: Amazon has announced that more than 300K U.S.-based small and medium-sized (SMB) businesses joined the Amazon Marketplace in 2017, selling billions of items to customers around the world. Many of these sellers used Amazon logistics called Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA). Peter Faricy, VP for Amazon Marketplace also said that this group sells half the products that Amazon customers buy.Moreover, more than 140K small and medium-sized businesses surpassed $100,000 in sales on Amazon in 2017. During the Holiday Season, customers ordered more than 1 billion items from SMBs on Amazon, with more than 140 million items ordered between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday. Amazon Handmade expanded to encompass 10 categories offering customers more than one million handcrafted items from thousands of artisans and small business owners across all 50 states and more than 60 countries. Amazon Lending surpassed $3 billion lent to small businesses on Amazon since the program started in 2011.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

2775,HPQ,"The biggest tech show of the year, Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2018, concluded last Friday. Although the focus remained on robotic, artificial intelligence and self-driving technologies, tech companies did not leave any stone unturned to please gaming enthusiasts as well. In fact, this time a number of companies displayed some extravagant products which are set to change the gaming experience entirely this year.Therefore, if you are a game lover, then be prepared for these gaming-related electronic products which will hit the floors very soon. The products include large displays, consoles and some cool PC gaming gears.Though plenty of product launches were announced during the event but here we would like to bring to your notice only the most notable ones.Play it “Big” on these Giant ScreensThis year game lovers will be able to play on big screens as various tech companies unveiled giant displays during the CES event. The first such display to catch our eyes was NVIDIA Corporation’s (NVDA  -  Free Report) “big format gaming displays, or BFGDs” which has been made in collaboration with HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report), Asus and Acer.According to the company, BFGDs put together “a high-end 65-inch, 4K 120Hz HDR display with NVIDIA G-SYNC technology together with NVIDIA SHIELD, the world’s most advanced streaming device.” NVIDIA noted that combination of these technologies will give users a ""buttery-smooth gaming experience"" as well as enable them to stream their favourite streaming applications.Furthermore, the recent development indicates that the TV market might become more competitive with PC manufacturers like HP, ASUS and Acer setting foot in the segment.Other products in the large display category which grabbed our attention are Samsung’s 146-inch “The Wall” and LG’s 65-inch “Rollable OLED” TVs. While Samsung did not reveal much about its product, LG’s TV can be rolled down with your command and limit the size of the screen as per your choice.Own These Cool ConsolesIn the meantime, tech giants including Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Nintendo (NTDOY  -  Free Report) and Sony (SNY  -  Free Report) stayed away from the limelight, on the gaming console front, giving way for the smaller firms to display the latest hardware.Of those, Retro-bit’s Super Retro Trio Plus, which plays original NES, SNES, and Sega Genesis cartridges, was the cynosure of all eyes. But its key feature is the addition of HDMI port and 720p resolution that makes it suitable to play old games on new television sets. Apart from this, Retro-bit also introduced a portable gaming console — GoRetro Portable — which, according to the company, will have more than 350 preloaded games.Another video game peripheral maker, Hyperkin, rolled out a portable gaming console, Ultra Game Boy, and a specialized Android game controller — SmartBoy — at the grand tech show. The company also launched SupaBoy SFC — a device through which one can play old games.Go on a Roller Coaster Ride With These PC Gaming GearsIn the gaming gears segment, the star attraction was ASUS’s “Bezel-free kit” that can help game lovers to link multiple monitors together. Created by ASUS Republic of Gamers (ROG), this is simply an optical device which creates illusion around monitors and even hides the seam where each bezel meets. Above all, the device has no software as well as no power bar to plug in. Isn’t it a cool device which can enlarge screens?The next is HTC’s Vive Pro headset and a wireless adapter. This advanced Vive Pro headset comes with a higher resolution of 1,440 x 1,600, two front-facing cameras in comparison with the single one in its older version, and includes built-in headphones as well.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it. If you don't buy now, you may kick yourself in 2020.Click here for the 6 trades >>

2776,HPQ,"The two independent research firms — Gartner Inc. (IT  -  Free Report) and International Data Corporation (“IDC”) — yesterday reported worldwide PC shipment data for the fourth quarter of 2017. Although the figures reported by both firms are different, they share a similar opinion that the worldwide PC shipment has shown concrete signs of improvement in the quarter.Although the PC shipment declined year over year, Gartner’s data depicts that it is rather modest compared with several previous quarters. On the other hand, as per IDC, PC shipment recorded its “first positive holiday quarter shipment growth in six years.”Decline Moderated – Per GartnerThe preliminary data released by Gartner displayed that PC shipments in the fourth quarter were down 2% year over year to 71.6 million units. The decline marked the 13th straight quarter of year-over-year fall, which is the longest duration of decline in the history of the PC industry.As per the data compiled by Gartner, the overall PC market was mainly adversely affected by weak demand for consumer PCs. The decline in the segment came despite a record holiday season which signifies that PCs are no longer favorite gift items for the season, Mikako Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner, said in her note.For the full year, PC shipments declined 2.8% from the prior-year level to 262.5 million units. This independent research firm highlighted a very interesting fact that in the last six or seven years, the PC industry has consolidated heavily. Gartner reported that in 2017, the top four vendors have combined market share of 64% which is much higher than the 45% grabbed by the top four vendors of 2011.First Holiday Growth in Six Years – Per IDCUnlike Gartner, the data compiled by IDC states that worldwide PC shipments registered the first growth in the last six holiday seasons. The difference in data is mainly due to separate techniques used for tracking PC sales, as well as the inclusion and/or exclusion of certain products. For example, unlike Gartner, IDC includes Chromebooks, which run on Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Chrome operating system. Gartner, on the other hand, takes into account Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) tablets and ""detachables"" such as the iPad Pro and the Asus Transformer, which are not taken into account by IDC.During the fourth quarter, PC shipments touched 70.6 million units, marking year-over-year growth of 0.7% and outperforming the research firm’s earlier prediction of a fall of 1.7%. The growth was mainly driven by “commercial upgrades and pockets of improving consumer PC demand.”For the full year, although IDC reported a 0.2% year-over-year volume decline in PC shipments, it stated that 2017 marks the most stable year for the industry since 2011. PC shipments were 259.5 million units during 2017.Computer - Mini computers Industry 5YR % Return  Computer - Mini computers Industry 5YR % Return Top Vendors ListAlthough both research firms’ data varies, they have similar views when it comes to ranking of top vendors. The firms agree that HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) continues to be the market leader in the space, followed by Lenovo, Dell, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Asus and Acer Group. Notably, Asus and Acer tied for the fifth spot, according to Gartner as well as IDC.Both firms stated that among the top vendors mentioned above, HP, Dell and Apple registered year-over-year growth in PC shipments, while Asus and Acer marked declines. The firms have different opinion on Lenovo as Gartner states that it registered a decline, while its shipment remained flat year over year, as per IDC.Talking about only the U.S. market, it is only HP which has witnessed increase in PC shipments as well as improvement in market share. Per Gartner, this was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment growth for the company in the U.S. market.Moreover, the quarter marked the seventh consecutive quarter of overall shipment growth for HP. We believe the spin-off from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, and restructuring initiatives, such as focus on product innovations, pricing, marketing and sales activities, divestment of non-core assets, and cutting jobs to lower costs, are apparently paying off at last.Region-Wise PerformanceTalking about the geographical performance, the firms have a slightly different opinion. Per Gartner, Asia/Pacific, Japan and Latin America registered improvement in PC shipments, while the EMEA region slightly declined. However, the U.S. market witnessed a steep decline as consumers were seen preferring new “popular products, such as voice-enabled speakers, and newly released smartphones” over PCs during the holiday season, per Kitagawa.On the other hand, per IDC, except the United States, all three regions — EMEA, APeJ and Japan — reported growth in the quarter.However, the major thing highlighted by the firms was PC shipment growth in China, mainly driven by the huge success of Single Day promotion and strong demand for commercial PCs. According to Gartner, PC shipment in the country inched up 1.1% in the fourth quarter.What’s Ahead?Although the overall PC market is still very challenging, the forward-looking statements of the research firms indicate that the PC industry is moving toward stabilization. Jay Chou, IDC research manager, noted in a statement that “The fourth quarter results showed some potentially encouraging headway against the difficult environment in retail and consumer PCs.”Both firms agreed that consumers now look for more advanced and quality devices rather than low-priced PCs. Kitagawa of Gartner said that ""the PC will become a more specialized, purpose-driven device.”IDC’s Chou has more or less similar views as he mentioned that ""Enticed by a growing array of products that promise all-day battery life, high portability, and address emerging use cases that require more compute power, pockets of the consumer base are taking a serious look at these revamped PCs.”The aforementioned positive comments on the PC market by the two industry experts will provide a respite to the PC vendors, as well as the companies which are dependent on the PC industry.An improving trend in PC shipments will benefit the business prospects of companies like HP Inc., Microsoft, Intel Corporation, Seagate Technologies (STX  -  Free Report) and Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report), which continue to depend substantially on PC sales.Currently, Western Digital sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Seagate carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2777,HPQ,"3D Systems Corporation (DDD  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 2, before the market opens. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether or not this 3D printing solution provider will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter.The company has a dismal earnings surprise history, with earnings missing estimates by a wide margin, in three out of the trailing four quarters. However, in the last-reported quarter, it posted a positive earnings surprise of a whopping 400%. This resulted in an average positive surprise of 9.9% for the last four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that 3D Systems is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.It should be noted that stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) are best avoided, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.3D Systems carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, which makes surprise prediction difficult. Furthermore, it should be noted that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings remained unchanged over the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is pegged at a penny, representing year-over-year slump of 83.3%. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $158.8 billion, up 1.5% from the year-ago quarter figure.3D Systems Corporation Price and EPS Surprise 3D Systems Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | 3D Systems Corporation Quote Factors at PlayFor the past few quarters, 3D Systems has been experiencing unfavorable broader market conditions which have affected its financial performance. Macroeconomic factors such as economic slowdown, inflation, currency fluctuations, commodity prices and credit availability have dampened the company’s performance. In the prior quarter, revenues from 3D printing products and services were almost flat year over year. In full-year 2017, total printer revenues slipped 7%. We believe the aforementioned problems still persist, which is likely to have adversely impacted 3D Systems’ first-quarter performance.In addition, the company’s high operating and acquisition costs are anticipated to continue hurting its near-term operating income performance. Further, the company believes investment in IT and go-to-market initiatives will result in elevated expenses, consequently restricting near-term operating income growth.This apart, 3D Systems has to contend itself with strong competition, which often results in price cuts and lower profitability. The entry of HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) and General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) has shaken things up in the industry, and remains a concern for 3D Systems.Nonetheless, the company’s focus on strengthening its foothold in the 3D printing industry is expected to provide a favorable long-term opportunity. As a matter of fact, majority of 3D Systems customers are shifting from prototyping to end-use production using 3D printing technology, and the company believes it is well positioned to aid customers in their transition. In addition to this, demand for production printers, materials and software is expected to have been a major catalyst, stoking growth.Furthermore, over the past few years, 3D Systems’ healthcare business has proven to be its strongest profit churner. To make the most of the positive industry trends, the company has developed a spectrum of innovative solutions ranging from simulation to implants. We believe the new offerings, along with high demand for printers and materials from medical and dental customers, to have bolstered the healthcare business top line in the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well.A Stock With a Favorable CombinationSeagate Technology PLC (STX  -  Free Report) is a stock you may want to consider as our model shows that the company has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat.Seagate has an Earnings ESP of +3.43% and flaunts a Zacks Rank of 1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce """"the world's first trillionaires,"""" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

2778,HPQ,"The technology sector is in focus this week with the Customer Electronics Show (CES) 2018 set to begin tomorrow and run through this Friday. It is a Las Vegas-based annual technology tradeshow conducted by the Consumer Technology Association in January.However, even before the biggest tech show of the year officially commences, we saw dozens of tech biggies holding press conferences throughout yesterday. But it was NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) which, by displaying its initiatives in driverless vehicles and powering artificial intelligence (AI) technology to build autonomous vehicles, stole the limelight.It Was All About Autonomous VehiclesNVIDIA, during yesterday’s late-hour press conference, revealed a number of partnerships in the space. At the event, the company announced two important collaborations — with Uber Technologies Inc. and Volkswagen AG — which show NVIDIA’s growing dominance in providing AI platforms which will power future vehicles.Uber has been using NVIDIA’s AI computing technology in its fleet of self-driving vehicles. Founder and CEO of NVIDIA, Jensen Huang, stated during the press conference that “the collaboration utilizes NVIDIA technology for Uber Advanced Technologies Group’s fleets of self-driving cars and freight trucks, running AI algorithms that enable vehicles to perceive the world, predict what will happen next and quickly choose the best course of action, even in complex environments.”Meanwhile, Volkswagen has been working on creating new cockpit experiences and improving safety for its future vehicles by using NVIDIA’s DRIVE IX AI platform. Volkswagen will use NVIDIA’s “DRIVE IX technology to create “Intelligent Co-Pilot” applications, which will include convenience and assistance systems based on processing sensor data from both inside and outside of the car” per the company press release.Enhancing AI Capabilities to Power Autonomous VehiclesNVIDIA knows it very well that for the successful operation of autonomous vehicles, a powerful AI supercomputing platform is required. Therefore, the company is also making efforts to boost its AI capabilities.On this front, NVIDIA has joined forces with Aurora to build a “Level 4 and Level 5 self-driving hardware platform” by using its NVIDIA DRIVE Xavier processor. Huang, during the press conference, noted, “NVIDIA’s automotive team is working with Aurora to bring up a new modular and scalable DRIVE Xavier platform that will bring autonomous vehicles to market.”Apart from this, the company announced collaborating with Baidu Inc. (BIDU  -  Free Report) and German auto supplier ZF Friedrichshafen AG to build a “production-ready AI autonomous vehicle platform” specially designed for the Chinese market. The partnership will infuse NVIDIA DRIVE Xavier platform and ZF’s ProAI car computer into Baidu’s Apollo Pilot, which according to the company, is “an autonomous driving product targeted for mass production.” The companies anticipate to roll out autonomous vehicles on China roads by early 2020.Other Highlights from the Press ConferenceAlthough NVIDIA’s key focus was on autonomous vehicles, it did not forget to please gaming enthusiasts which generates most of its revenues. The company introduced a hardware “big format gaming displays, or BFGDs” in collaboration with HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report), Asus and Acer, to bring in enormous gaming experience on a very big screen — 65 inches.According to the company, BFGDs put together “a high-end 65-inch, 4K 120Hz HDR display with NVIDIA G-SYNC technology together with NVIDIA SHIELD, the world’s most advanced streaming device.” NVIDIA says that combination of these technologies will give users a ""buttery-smooth gaming experience"" as well as will enable them to stream their favourite streaming applications.Bottom LineWith its continued focus on developing new and more advanced AI technologies for self-diving cars, we believe the company is well poised to become a leading provider of technology for autonomous vehicles. In this space, the company is already a market leader, outpacing other competitors, such as Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) and Advanced Micro Devices, in terms of growth.Estimates provided by various research firms further encourage us about NVIDIA’s prospects in the space. According to data available from BI intelligence, 10 million self driving cars will be on the roads by 2020.Per Statista, the market for fully autonomous vehicles will grow to almost $6 billion, while partially autonomous vehicles market will reach $36 billion by 2025. According to Boston Consulting Group estimates, the autonomous car market will be worth $42 billion by 2025 and $77 billion by 2035.NVIDIA remains one of the best performers in the semiconductor space. Notably, the stock has more than doubled in the last one year, significantly outperforming its industry’s gain of 48.5%.NVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

2779,HPQ,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 5.4% in in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.HP Reports Strong Q4 EarningsHP has come up with another quarter of stellar performance. The company reported better-than-expected results in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 and revenues increased for the fifth-consecutive quarter after an extended period of decline. Also, the Personal Systems and Print segments have improved for the third-straight quarter after 2010.In fact, the company’s outstanding results for the last few quarters substantiate  that the spin-off from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE - Research Report) coupled with restructuring initiatives is finally paying off for HP.HP’s total revenues increased 11% year over year to $13.927 billion and outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.246 billion. The better-than-expected top-line performance was driven mainly by strength in the Personal System and Printing segments along with the successful launch of products.The company’s bottom-line results were also impressive, wherein its non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of 44 cents per share matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The figure came toward the higher-end of management’s earlier guidance range of 42-45 cents. On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP earnings improved 22.2%.Quarter in DetailThe Personal Systems segment generated revenues of $9.084 billion, up 13% year over year.  While commercial revenues increased 11%, consumer revenues were up 18%.Printing revenues were up 7% year over year to $4.877 billion, primarily owing to a 10% increase in supplies revenues. HP’s total hardware unit sales grew 3% backed by Consumer hardware units increase of 3%. Commercial hardware units, however, remained flat on a year-over-year basis.Region wise, revenues from Americas were up 10% year over year. While revenues from Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) grew 11%, the same from the Asia Pacific and Japan region increased 16% year over year, all in constant currency.However, gross margin contracted 20 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 18.1%, primarily due to elevated commodity costs of Personal Systems. This was partially offset by better margin in the printing segment backed by improved productivity and higher supplies mix.Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 6% year over year to $1.5 billion.Non-GAAP operating margin from continuing operations remained flat year over year at 7%. HP’s non-GAAP net income from continuing operations came in at $749 million compared with $614 million reported a year ago.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowHP ended the fiscal fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $6.997 billion compared with $6.967 billion in the previous quarter. The company had long-term debt of $6.747 billion compared with $6.744 billion last quarter.The company generated cash flow of $680 million from operational activities during the quarter. HP repurchased shares worth $501 million and paid dividends worth $221 million, in the same time frame.During fiscal 2017, operating cash flow came in at $3.677 billion while the company paid $894 million as cash dividend and bought back shares worth $1.412 billion.GuidanceHP raised its earnings guidance range for fiscal 2018. The company now anticipates non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations in the band of $1.75-$1.85 (previously $1.74-$1.84). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.79 per share.For the fiscal first quarter, HP projects non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations in the range of 40-43 cents per share (mid-point: 41.5 cents). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 42 cents.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Analysts were quiet during the last month as none of them issued any earnings estimate revisions.HP Inc. Price and Consensus  HP Inc. Price and Consensus | HP Inc. QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, HP's stock has an average Growth Score of C, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for value investors than growth and momentum investors.OutlookNotably, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect in-line returns from the stock in the next few months.

2780,HPQ,"HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) is one of those technology companies that have demonstrated remarkable share price performance in the year so far. The company has generated high returns for investors in the year-to-date period and has the potential to exceed expectations in the next year.HP is one of the two companies which came into existence post the split from the parent company — Hewlett-Packard Company — in November 2015. The other company was Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report).The stock has been clocking solid returns since the split and has surged approximately 51.8%, substantially outperforming the S&P 500’s return of 26.4% during the same time frame. The major part of the rally has been witnessed this year. In the YTD period, the stock has appreciated 41.4%, while the S&P 500 has gained 19.3%.Let’s check out the reasons for this impressive surge in share price and consider why HP will continue its momentum in the next year as well.Revamped PC BusinessPost the split, HP adopted a strategy of focusing on product innovation & differentiation, pricing, and marketing and sales activities to trigger demand for its PC products in the market. The company has launched various models under its PC product lines of EliteBook, Spectre and Pavilion Wave, in a year’s time.The impact of these initiatives is well highlighted by the fact that the company has regained its top position in the PC segment by replacing Lenovo. Also, according to data compiled by IDC, during third-quarter 2017, the company’s PC shipments registered the sixth quarter of consecutive year-over-year growth after witnessing several quarters of decline.Furthermore, the two independent research firms — Gartner and International Data Corporation — hinted that the PC industry has been moving toward stabilization. Therefore, we believe stabilization in PC shipments will benefit business prospects of companies like HP.Print Segment Shines AgainThe company’s efforts to revamp its printing business have also been commendable. It should be noted that HP has acquired Samsung Electronics’ printer business. The acquisition is a strategic fit for HP as it has expanded the company’s printing business, with the addition of 6,500-plus printing patents owned by Samsung.In addition to the above, the company is now focused on fortifying its 3D printing business capabilities. However, unlike 3D Systems (DDD  -  Free Report) and Stratasys (SSYS  -  Free Report), which target all kinds of consumers, HP is emphasizing only on industrial markets due to their ability to afford a premium range of 3D printing solutions. It should be noted that even though HP has been operating in this space for almost five years now, it still lags behind 3D Systems and Stratasys.These efforts have paid off well with the company registering the third consecutive quarter of print business revenue growth in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017.Also, the company’s last quarterly results reflected revenue growth for the fifth consecutive quarter after witnessing a prolonged period of decline. Further, the Personal Systems and Print segments improved for the third straight quarter after 2010.Stock Still UndervaluedThe stock currently trades at a forward earnings estimate at 11.7x, which is way lower than the industry average of 17.8x. Given its recent track record of revenues and earnings growth, as well as the long-term forecast, the stock is highly undervalued which signifies that it is still left with significant upside potential.Moreover, HP has a VGM Style Score of A. We note that our VGM score highlights the determining elements in a stock that can push the stock price higher. We can essentially filter out the negatives and focus on the positives which drive price.Therefore, we consider that HP is one such technology stock which investors should keep in their portfolio. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

2781,HPQ,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) reported non-GAAP earnings of 11 cents per share for first-quarter 2018 compared with break-even reported in the year-ago quarter. The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 9 cents per share.Revenues increased 40% year over year to $1.65 billion and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.52 billion.The accelerated adoption of the company’s products in the PC, gaming and data center industries primarily led to its impressive performance.SegmentsAdvanced Micro has two reportable segments — Computing and Graphics (focused on the traditional PC market) and Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom (focusing on adjacent high-growth opportunities).Computing and GraphicsComputing and Graphics segment revenues witnessed year-over-year increase of 95% to $1.12 billion. The increase can be attributed to accelerated sales of Radeon graphics and Ryzen desktop processors.Operating income for this segment was $138 million against a loss of $21 million in the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by higher revenues.Notably, the introduction of Ryzen desktop accelerated processing unit (APU) with a combination of Radeon “Vega” graphics architecture and “Zen” CPU cores is a huge positive for the company. Additionally, Advanced Micro launched its “2nd Generation Ryzen desktop CPUs”, which can enhance gaming performance by around 15%.Advanced Micro and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) announced a collaboration for providing support to Radeon FreeSync technology in Microsoft’s Xbox One S and Xbox One X consoles.Prominent PC providers such as Acer, HP (HPQ  -  Free Report) and Lenovo, which are part of Advanced Micro’s client base, recorded impressive sales during the quarter, which is encouraging. The release of Dell’s new notebooks and 2-in-1s earlier this month is a tailwind for the company.Management also stated that Dell, HP and Lenovo are planning to launch commercial notebooks powered by Advanced Micro.Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-CustomSegment revenues amounted to $532 million, down 12% year over year due to lower semi-custom revenues.Operating income for the segment was $14 million compared with $55 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. The figure was higher in the year-ago quarter due to a licensing gain in the said time frame.The adoption of AMD EPYC processor-powered platforms continue to grow. During the quarter, Dell EMC launched “three new PowerEdge platforms powered by AMD EPYC 7000 series server processors.”Yahoo Japan Corporation and Packet were added to its list of clients. Additionally, Cray (CRAY  -  Free Report) announced the addition of “EPYC processors to its Cray CS500 line of HPC offerings.”Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

2784,HPQ,"Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) secretive approach to new products has been betrayed by employees in recent years and management isn’t amused. The company warned that leakers could be terminated immediately and be hard pressed to find alternative employment because of the negative publicity. An internal blog that said it had caught 29 leakers in the previous year, of which 12 were imprisoned, was however quickly leaked to the media. Here are some other titbits from last week-  Apple Music GainsApple continues to gain ground on Spotify, as the music service now has 40 million subscribers plus 8 million on free trial. Apple loyalists have stuck with the company even as the cost of its devices continued to increase. This, along with its stand on security and privacy has led to a large installed base that Apple can then offer its services to. Apple’s advantage with its installed base is the main reason it is gaining on Spotify, especially in the U.S.Spotify (SPOT  -  Free Report) remains very strong internationally, which probably explains why Apple is bringing in somebody like Oliver Schusser as the new VP. Schusser has been with Apple for 14 long years; he has launched services like the iTunes store, App Store and iBooks for international markets; and has considerable experience managing the company's relationships with publishers and music labels outside the U.S. This is a challenge to Spotify, which still leads the subscriber numbers with 71 million paying customers (it also has an ad-supported tier).Apple HomePod Sales DisappointApple’s HomePod sales leave a lot to be desired, according to a recent report from Bloomberg. And that isn’t really surprising given that its features leave a lot to be desired. Apart from market-leading sound quality, Apple’s not bringing anything new to the table at all, despite its late entry.It appears that Apple doesn’t view the HomePod as a product category in its own right, doing everything that home automation devices like the ones from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) or Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) do because its app ecosystem is practically nonexistent. Instead, it’s more like an accessory to its other devices.This doesn’t mean that Apple won’t make changes. It will. In fact the most important step in this direction has already been taken with its poaching of Google’s AI executive. Siri after all is where the work needs to be done and once that’s fixed, the app ecosystem will quickly fall in place.As it is, pre orders for the product were high, with Apple taking a third of the market in the last week of January, according to data by Slice Intelligence. But within three weeks after launch, that share dropped to 4%. Apple couldn’t sustain the momentum as users were disappointed with its limited functionality.Still, Apple watcher Gene Munster expects sales to pick up during the holiday season, helping Apple end the year at 7 million units even as Amazon sells 29 million and Alphabet 18 million units. In 2019, the three companies are expected to sell 11 million, 39 million and 32 million units, respectively, according to Munster.Apple PC Share DropsBoth Gartner and IDC have come out with first quarter shipment numbers and both agree that there was some inventory buildup in the prior quarter that impacted buying decisions. Anticipation of new models based on Intel’s new chips in the second quarter also impacted the numbers.As always, there are some differences due to differing calculation methods, but both agreed on the top vendors being HP (HPQ  -  Free Report), Lenovo and Dell.Public sector demand in China appears to have hit a pause as state owned companies postponed updates and new purchases in anticipation of changing policies. India and Indonesia were stronger than expected.According to IDC, the stabilizing trend was attributable to continued commercial renewal activity driven by Windows 10. HP, Dell and Lenovo benefited. In the EMEA region, demand for premium notebooks strengthened while gaming and commercial purchases also pushed demand for desktops. Apple, which saw limited benefit from these trends, saw its share dipping to 6.6% (from 7.0% in the first quarter of 2017). Apple finished fifth, behind the top three and Acer.According to Gartner, HP, Lenovo and Dell are followed by Apple, Asus and then Acer. Apple’s shipments grew 1.5 points to 6.9% from 6.7% a year ago.Apple Loses Case Vs VirnetXApple was handed another loss when a Texas jury announced an 8-0 verdict against it in a legal battle spanning eight years. A 2016 jury found Apple guilty of infringement, after which Apple attempted a redesign of its Facetime and VPN on Demand features that this jury again found to be inadequate. The amount payable as damages is also rising every year. Just last year, Apple was reportedly ordered to pay $440 million and already, the damages payable is up to $502.6 million. But since an amount of this size is a drop in the ocean for Apple, the Cupertino-based company continues to appeal the courts’ decisions.Meanwhile, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board has invalidated the patents in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington although the Federal Circuit didn’t stay the jury trial because it was nearing its conclusion.Some have described VirnetX as a patent troll, i.e. a company with no product of its own that buys patents to make money from litigation. But it’s probably also worth remembering that it was born out of government contractor SAIC Inc that develops secure communications for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) on the off chance that Microsoft would buy it. But Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) instead settled with it for a total $223 million back in 2010.Apple On Wrong Side Of Korea FTCThe South Korean Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) has concluded its investigations into Apple’s practice of foisting its advertising and repair costs, running into billions of wons, on local telecom operators. The investigations have been going on since 2016. The Korea Herald reported that the KFTC has come to the conclusion that Apple is guilty, particularly with respect to some ads run by telecoms SKT, KT and LG Uplus. Accordingly, they intend to fine Apple once its Korea branch has responded to the charge. This isn’t the first time Apple has resorted to such tactics; the company earlier did exactly the same thing in Taiwan and France.  Apple shares carry a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

2786,HPQ,"HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) recently made a few important announcements regarding its strategic initiatives in line with the industry’s evolution at one of its most significant partner event, Executive Forum 2018, in the Americas.  The announcements included the incorporation of “premium features and expressive designs into its convertible, notebook and desktop PCs”. The company also introduced a new range of notebooks, displays and desktops called HP Pavilion Gaming to address the requirements of gamers.Additionally, HP announced the expansion of its “A3 multifunction printer line, now including new PageWide A3 skus for both transactional and contractual channels with external finishing”. It entered into a partnership with ImageNet Consulting, LLC for improvement of efficiency of A3 product line as well.Notably, post the split from the parent company — Hewlett-Packard Company — in November 2015, HP has been focusing on product innovation & differentiation, pricing, and marketing and sales activities to trigger demand for its PC and Printing products in the market. The company has generated high returns for investors over the past year.In a year's time, the stock has appreciated 18.7% outperforming the S&P 500's gain of 13.8%.Meanwhile, HP’s initiatives seem to be paying off. This is evident from a report by IDC which states that in fourth-quarter 2017 the company’s PC shipments registered the seventh quarter of consecutive year-over-year growth after witnessing several quarters of decline. Additionally, Gartner and IDC believes that the PC industry is moving toward stabilization, which is another positive for the company.Moreover, the company’s acquisition of Samsung Electronics’ printer business bodes well for its printing segment, with the addition of 6,500-plus printing patents owned by Samsung. HP’s initiatives toward fortifying its 3D printing business capabilities are also encouraging. Still, the company lags behind 3D Systems (DDD  -  Free Report) and Stratasys (SSYS  -  Free Report).Nevertheless, HP’s initiatives are reflecting in its impressive financials. In the past quarter, the company witnessed sixth consecutive revenue growth after witnessing a prolonged period of decline. Going ahead, we expect this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock to perform even better backed by its strategic initiatives.Key PickAnother stock in the technology sector worth considering is Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Western Digital’s long-term earnings growth rate is projected at 19%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2787,HPQ,"Per Reuters, Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report) has now “temporarily disabled” the option that lets advertisers exclude certain racial groups from their target audience. The move comes after ProPublica’s expose that it could buy “discriminatory” housing ads and could easily dodge the social media giant’s ad review process.Under The Fair Housing Act (1968) and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (1974), it is illegal to keep out any section of the society on grounds of race, ethnicity, or sex for housing/credit. In fact, any ad that discriminates between people based on race, religion and sex is considered a felony in the United States.This is not the first time that ProPublica has been able to dodge Facebook’s review process. In September 2017, ProPublica, a non-profit organization that takes up investigative journalism in public interest, claimed that Facebook’s self-serving ad platform “enabled advertisers to direct their pitches to the news feeds of almost 2,300 people who expressed interest in the topics of “Jew hater,” “How to burn jews,” or, “History of ‘why jews ruin the world.”The outlet also claimed that it paid $30 to test if this was actually true. It paid the amount to target those groups with three promoted posts and much to its dismay, Facebook just took less than 15 minutes to approve these ads.Facebook, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Facebook, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Facebook, Inc. QuotePost the expose, COO Sheryl Sandberg was quoted by Reuters saying, “Until we can better ensure that our tools will not be used inappropriately, we are disabling the option that permits advertisers to exclude multicultural affinity segments from the audience for their ads.”The company has reportedly also added that it is conducting a study on how advertisers are able to exclude certain racial groups (including LGBT community) and such ads will now be subjected to stringent review. The measures will be elaborated in the time to come.Facebook has been in dire straits this year regarding its ads review process. The Russian ad fiasco (related to Brexit and U.S presidential elections) caused extensive PR damage. The company testified to the U.S. Congress regarding the alleged misuse of its platform and is meeting with European regulators next week.To salvage the situation, the company has put in place monetization eligibility standards to make it clear that creators and publishers, which meet its strict guidelines, will be eligible to earn money on its platform. Repeated failure to comply with these terms will result in removal of access to the monetization features.Not just Facebook, brand safety issues plagued Google’s YouTube earlier this year. This year in March, YouTube ran into trouble with advertisers as it was revealed that some ads ran before extremist videos, prompting advertisers to withdraw their ad spots, per media reports. Consequently, Google had to tighten its ad policy to lure advertisers back.Facebook carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2788,HPQ,"Apple Inc’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) radically overhauled iPhone X was anticipated to be a super cycle and it seems like it is turning into one.Going a step ahead, Piper Jaffray analyst, Michael Olson in his research titled “Why AAPL Can Keep Working: 'Super Cycle' Is Now 'Super Long Cycle'' has stated that, “this could well turn into a “super long cycle” driven by the next iterations of iPhone X.He was quoted by CNBC saying, “Apple may be increasingly well positioned to experience a strong multi-year iPhone trajectory, not the short-lived 'super cycle' that was anticipated. We believe an elongated iPhone cycle in FY18, followed by a wider array of iPhone X 'offspring' in Fall-18, along with growing awareness and interest in augmented reality (fueled by developers populating app store with new use cases and, longer-term, addition of rear facing 3D sensor), will all push out the need for Apple to answer the question of 'what's next?.'""Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Apple Inc. QuoteCiting a threefold jump in Apple’s demand for 3D sensing components from its suppliers, Olson expects Apple to release three new editions next year with better OLED displays.Robust Black Friday SalesThe tenth anniversary edition of the iPhone is witnessing robust sales with 6 million units sold over the Black Friday weekend, per a report from Rosenblatt China Technology.  Nearly 15 million units have been sold since its launch. The firm expects as many as 3 million units to be shipped in the current quarter. Apple is also ramping up iPhone X production with 3 million units produced per week and is expected to increase it by another one million by December, per the report.Apple releases its new models in September and the December quarter usually sees high sale activity. In the year-ago period, Apple sold 45.5 million units of iPhone. This time around, reportedly, it looks like Apple is set to break all records and sell 80 million iPhone units.Sales of iPhone X will get a boost as the phone features a glass body, a dual curved edge-to-edge OLED display with wireless charging (USB-C), higher storage options and a far superior camera.For the current quarter, Apple expects sales to be in the range of $84 to $87 billion compared with $78.4 billion reported in fiscal first-quarter 2017. Higher average selling price should significantly contribute to the top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $85.8 billion.iPhone, Revenues and Stock PriceiPhone continues to be the mainstay of Apple’s revenues. The revolutionary phone, released in June 2007, changed the world forever and catapulted Apple to new highs. The success of iPhone over the last decade is well chronicled.Reportedly, Apple has sold over 1.2 billion iPhones across the globe, earning over $760 billion in revenues.Since the first iPhone release, Apple shares have skyrocketed compared with the industry to which it belongs. Over the last decade, Apple stock has returned 885.7% while the industry witnessed a rally of 418.5%.There are also speculations that robust iPhone X sales will make Apple the first company to touch the $1 trillion valuation mark. Currently, Apple’s market cap is nearly $882 billion. Its shares have increased about 48.4% year over year and hit a 52-week high of $176.24. Shares are currently trading at $171.85.Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Groupon Inc (GRPN  -  Free Report), Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) and HP Inc (HPQ  -  Free Report).

2789,HPQ,"Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) has been planning a major overhaul of its Mac Pro computers, released in 2013, for quite some time now. Finally, the company revealed to TechCrunch that it is likely to unveil the same in 2019.Apple has not given any information on product specifications but confirmed that it will still be modular. The company is also taking into account the feedback shared by top users and developers in building it.Notably, Apple has created a new Pro Workflow Team that coordinates with the company’s hardware and software teams to identify and solve “workflow bottlenecks”. The team also interacts with customers in order to ensure that the products meet their specific needs.Bloomberg recently reported that Apple is planning to replace Intel’s (INTC  -  Free Report) chips used in Mac computers with its own from 2020. However, it’s unlikely that the new Mac Pro computers will feature them.Shares of Apple have gained 20.3% in the past year, slightly outperforming the industry’s 19.4% rally.  Will the New Mac Strengthen Apple’s Position in PC Market?Apple’s focus to strengthen its Mac offerings is expected to help it revive its position in the PC market. The iPhone-maker is currently not a major player in the traditional PC market.Per IDC report, Apple increased its “traditional PC unit market share” from 7.1% in 2016 to 7.6% 2017.However, it lags HP (HPQ  -  Free Report), Lenovo and Dell, which have market share of 22.7%, 21.1% and 16.1%, respectively.In the last reported quarter, Mac accounted for just 7.8% of the company’s total sales. Its unit sales declined 5% year over year as well as sequentially to 5.1 million.

2790,HPQ,"The retail sales numbers for April were not very good. The Department of Commerce said sales fell by 0.2% last month, with clothing and department store sales down 2% and 2.1%, respectively. This data followed an average 2.3% drop in April same-store sales reported by 51 stores tracked by the International Council of Shopping Centers.
"
2791,HPQ,"The data is noteworthy because first-quarter earnings season for the retailers heats up next week with 14 chains on tap - including Dow components Home Depot (HD) and Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report). Other notables include Kohls (KSS  -  Free Report), J.C. Penny (JCP  -  Free Report) and Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report). The subpar April performance is being blamed on the timing of Easter and cooler April temperatures, but guidance will be watched for any signs of weakness in consumer spending. Given a relative lack of other catalysts, what the retailers say in their conference calls could impact market direction. (As of Friday morning, we have not seen changes to full-year earnings estimates in reaction to the April sales numbers.)
"
2792,HPQ,"Outside of the retailers, there is not much on the earnings calendar. Just 104 non-retail companies are confirmed to report including Dow component Hewlett-Packard (HPQ  -  Free Report) on Wednesday. Other notables are Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report) and Deere & Co (DE  -  Free Report).
"
2793,HPQ,"The first economic reports of the week come out on Tuesday with April CPI and the May New York Fed survey being released. April housing starts, industrial production and industrial capacity utilization are due out on Wednesday. Thursday features the weekly initial jobless claims report and the May Philadelphia Fed survey. The week ends with the preliminary University of Michigan consumer confidence index being published on Friday.

2795,HPQ,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises During the Week of May 14 - 18
"
2796,HPQ,"One-fifth of the covering brokerage analysts have raised their forecasts on Deere (DE  -  Free Report) within the past 30 days. These revisions have pushed the consensus earnings forecast for the fiscal second quarter up by a penny to $2.41 per share. The Most Recent Consensus is more bullish at $2.43 per share. DE exceeded expectations during the past two quarters by an average margin of 23.5 cents and full-year earnings estimates have been rising. Credit the strength in the agriculture sector plus sustained worldwide economic growth for the favorable sentiment towards the company's prospects. Deere is scheduled to report on May 16.
"
2797,HPQ,"The first-quarter consensus estimate for ICF International (ICFI  -  Free Report) has risen by 10 cents over the past 30 days to 44 cents per share. One of the three covering brokerage analysts materially raised his forecast on the consulting company in late-April. The Most Recent Consensus is more bullish at 45 cents per share. ICF International is scheduled to report on Monday, May 14, after the close of trading.
"
2798,HPQ,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises During the Week of May 14 - 18
"
2799,HPQ,"Mentor Corporation (MNT) warned in late April that slower sales in its breast aesthetics business would cause its fiscal 2007 revenues to be below its previous forecast of $305 to $315 million. The company now anticipates reporting revenues within a range of $300 to $302 million. About half of the covering brokerage analysts cut their forecasts for fiscal fourth-quarter profits, causing the consensus estimate to drop by two cents to 33 cents per share. The Most Recent Consensus is more bearish at 32 cents per share. MNT does have a history of surprising to the upside, however, so there is a possibility of analysts being overly cautious with their estimates. Mentor is scheduled to report on Wednesday, May 16.
"
2800,HPQ,"Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) reported a 3.5% drop in April same-store sales, led by a 4.6% decline in the company's namesake chain. Notably, five brokerage analysts had cut their first-quarter forecasts prior to the release of the April numbers. The consensus earnings estimate, and the Most Recent Consensus, of 68 cents per share is a penny below the forecast of a month ago. WMT has missed expectations once in the past three quarters. Wal-Mart is scheduled to report on Tuesday, May 15, before the start of trading.

2805,HPQ,"Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) interest in India recently got a major boost after the country’s government allowed import of used goods for repair and refurbishment of electronic devices.Per Reuters, Indian government will allow import on condition that the refurbished devices should be exported and the “waste generated during the repair and refurbishing of the imported items to be treated in line with local laws including health, safety and environment norms.”India’s new import policy is expected to benefit Apple in two ways. The iPhone-maker assembles, repairs, and refurbishes most of its devices in China, where it is already facing rising manufacturing as well as labor costs. Apple is likely take advantage from the new policy by shifting more manufacturing to India, thereby lowering costs.Moreover, Apple will be able to avoid some negative impact from the escalating trade war between the United States and China. President Trump has already imposed import tariffs of almost $60 billion on Chinese goods. China is likely to retaliate by imposing additional duties of up to $3 billion of U.S. imports.Apple shares were up 0.88% in pre-market trading on Mar 29. The stock has returned 15.6% in the past year, much better than 10.4% gain of S&P 500.  India: An Important Market for AppleApple considers India to be an important growth market for its devices, with iPhone being the primary growth driver.  According to a latest report from CyberMedia Research, by the end of 2018, India will have more than 10 million iPhone users, which is a significant achievement, considering the price-sensitive nature of the market.  Apple has only 2-3% of India’s smartphone market share, but dominates the premium segment (smartphones priced greater than Rs. 30,000). However, per Counterpoint Research estimates, Apple has lost market share in this segment to Samsung and OnePlus. This doesn’t bode well for the company’s future in the world’s second-largest smartphone market.Apple currently assembles only iPhone SE in India through its Taiwanese contract manufacturer Wistron. Reportedly, a unit of Winstron recently won approval from the state of Karnataka to build a new assembly facility, indicating a potential expansion of assembly work in India.Notably, Apple has been in active discussion with the government for tax breaks and incentives, which, however it has failed to gain, so far. Hence, the new import policy is definitely encouraging for Apple.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).HP (HPQ  -  Free Report), NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Paycom (PAYC  -  Free Report) are some of the better-ranked stocks worth considering in the broader technology sector. All the three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

2806,HPQ,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 5.1% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is HPQ due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.HP Reports Stellar Q1 ResultsHP delivered another quarter of stellar performance. The company reported better-than-expected results for first-quarter fiscal 2018. Its revenues increased for the sixth consecutive quarter, of which the last five have recorded double-digit growth after an extended period of decline. Also, the Personal Systems and Print segments’ performance improved for the fourth straight quarter after 2010.In fact, the company’s outstanding results for the last few quarters substantiate that the spin-off from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, along with its diligent restructuring initiatives, is finally paying off.HP’s total revenues increased 15% year over year to $14.517 billion and outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.432 billion. The better-than-expected top-line performance was driven mainly by strength in the Personal System and Printing segments as well as successful product roll outs.The company’s bottom-line results were also impressive, wherein its non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of 48 cents per share came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 42 cents as well as management’s earlier guidance range of 42-45 cents. On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP earnings improved 26%.Apart from higher revenues, the company’s bottom-line results benefited from lower effective tax rate due to the U.S. tax reform. HP noted that its fiscal first-quarter effective tax rate came in at 15% which is against its previous projection of 21-22%, resulting in a benefit of 4 cents per share.Quarter in DetailThe Personal Systems segment generated revenues of $9.440 billion, up 15% year over year.  While commercial revenues increased 16%, consumer revenues were up 13%. We believe the spin-off from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, and restructuring initiatives, such as focus on product innovations, pricing, marketing and sales activities, are ultimately apparently paying off.Notably, International Data Corporation, in its latest report on fourth-quarter 2017 PC shipment, stated that the quarter marked the seventh consecutive quarter of overall shipment growth for HP.Talking about only the U.S. market, it is only HP which recorded growth in PC shipments as well as improvement in market share. According to data compiled by Gartner, the quarter ended on Dec 31, 2017, was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment growth for the company in the U.S. market.Coming to the Printing business, this segment’s revenues were up 14% year over year to $5.076 billion, primarily owing to a 10% increase in supplies revenues and inclusion of the first full quarter of the newly acquired business of Samsung’s printing (S-Print) business. HP expects that the acquisition of the S-Print business will bring in additional revenues of approximately $1.4 billion in fiscal 2018.HP’s total hardware unit sales grew 14% backed by Consumer hardware units increase of 7% and Commercial hardware unit’s year-over-year growth of 73%. The robust growth in Commercial hardware units primarily stemmed from the recent inclusion of Samsung’s printing (S-Print) business.Region wise, the company registered double-digit growth in every region it operates. Revenues from Americas were up 10% year over year. While revenues from Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) climbed 13%, the same from the Asia Pacific and Japan region jumped 18% year over year, all in constant currency.Gross margin expanded 10 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 17.8%, primarily driven by better margin in the printing segment driven by improved productivity and higher supplies mix. This was partially offset by elevated commodity costs of Personal Systems.Non-GAAP operating expenses flared up 17% year over year to $1.6 billion. This was mainly due to the inclusion of S-Print business, and increased investment in research and development as well as go-to-market sales strategies.Non-GAAP operating margin from continuing operations remained flat year over year at 7% as the benefit from improved gross margin were fully offset by elevated operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. HP’s non-GAAP net income from continuing operations came in at $803 million compared with $646 million reported a year ago.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowHP ended the fiscal first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $5.475 billion compared with $6.997 billion recorded in the previous quarter. The company had long-term debt of $6.340 billion compared with $6.747 billion reported in the last quarter.The company generated cash flow of $996 million from operational activities during the quarter. HP repurchased shares worth $462 million and paid dividends worth $230 million during the same time frame.GuidanceThe company, during its conference call, noted that due to implementation of the new tax code, its effective cost rate for fiscal 2018 is likely to be 16% (+/- 2%), much lower than the previous projection of 21-22%, thereby benefiting HP’s non-GAAP earnings per share by 13 cents. However, the company stated that “higher variable performance bonus opportunities for non-executives” will result in dilution of approximately 3 cents toward non-GAAP earnings.Therefore, the net benefit from lower effective tax rate will be around 10 cents, of which it has already earned in the fiscal first quarter. So, the remaining three quarters are likely to see a tax benefit of 2 cents each.Keeping the aforementioned factor, along with improving market share across the PC and Printer businesses, HP raised its non-GAAP earnings guidance for fiscal 2018. The company now estimates non-GAAP earnings to lie between $1.90 and $2.00 (mid-point $1.95), up from the earlier guidance range of $1.75-$1.85 (mid-point $1.80).For the fiscal second quarter, HP projects non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations in the range of 45-49 cents per share (mid-point: 47 cents).How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.

2807,HPQ,"President Donald Trump has announced tariffs on $60 billion worth of Chinese imports, kicking off what may turn into a trade war between the two countries. This, it should be mentioned, is a fraction of the $500 billion worth of goods the U.S. imports from China.The President’s action is based on findings that forced transfer (by theft and otherwise) of American intellectual property by the Chinese is now valued at $48 billion a year, up from earlier estimates of around $30 billion a year. It also takes into consideration the fact that China blocks a large number of U.S. companies, including technology firms and credit card companies, from operating in the country.Citing Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, the President’s memorandum directed the government to take action. These actions are higher tariffs on items that the government will specify in 15 days and U.S. industry will have another 15 days to submit comments on before they go into effect.The list of products to be impacted hasn’t been named yet, but they will reportedly cover 1,300 product categories that will be subject to a 25% tariff. Informal comments from government officials indicate that they will target the high tech industries China is trying to build (China earlier named 10 industries including information technology, advanced industrial equipment, biopharmaceuticals, green energy and aerospace as focus areas for its ‘Made in China 2025’ initiative). Yahoo Finance columnist Rick Newman speculates that the Trump tariffs could follow the same blueprint for maximum effect.Trump wants China to cut the country’s $375 billion merchandise trade deficit with China by $100 billion.Chinese Ambassador to the U.S. Cui Tiankai says that the U.S hasn’t specified what it wants and has instead suspended formal trade talks. And while China doesn’t “want a trade war,” it “is not afraid of it. If somebody tries to impose a trade war on us, we will certainly fight back and retaliate.”What China Could Do in RetaliationThe Chinese could do a lot of damage, both to certain industries and to Trump’s position at the White House, as he contests the mid-terms later this year. On the other hand, Chinese President Xi Jinping has avoided the election process and has got no one to please but the communist party he represents. So while he can take actions that will be temporarily difficult on Chinese people, Trump may be able to do it only at the cost of his own office. Which wouldn’t solve the problem.So when Trump announced the tariffs on steel and aluminum (and America largely doesn’t even buy steel from China), the Chinese Commerce Ministry responded within a week with increased tariffs on $3 billion of U.S. goods including a 25% tariff on U.S. pork imports and 15% tariff on American steel pipes, fruit and wine. China has said it will go through the World Trade Organization (WTO) process, which could mean trouble for the U.S. because some industry experts think that the U.S. doesn’t have the right to take such action.The stakes are obviously much higher this time, so the sanctions could hit soybeans, sorghum, live hogs and Boeing planes, which are also major Chinese imports.The non-diversified farming states where Trump scored most of his victories (reportedly eight of the top 10 soy and hog-producing states, and seven of the top 10 sorghum states) will be the worst affected, which can also tip the scales against him.China has also hinted that the trade deficit problem can be fixed with U.S. export of high tech equipment, which of course isn’t a solution because it will lead to even more theft and strengthening of China versus the U.S.   U.S. Markets to Face the BacklashThe technology supply chain that will be affected by the trade war won’t just affect China and the United States. There will be implications for South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and others. And the U.S. may be able to rally support from Canada and Mexico by softening its stand on NAFTA and also with the EU and Australia because all are affected by Chinese steel overcapacity.Live Hogs: As far as the live hog market is concerned, China has been preparing for this contingency. It has for some time been the largest importer of hogs, especially from the U.S.But of late, record high hog prices have enabled Chinese companies to build very large farms with state of the art machinery and disease control and waste management systems. Last year, the government also cracked down on small farmers that couldn’t invest adequately in waste disposal systems. This sent many of the small farmers out of business while strengthening the position for larger farmers. China has been using superior genes from British, French and American breeds and building its large farms on U.S. prototypes.It’s expected that in the next few years, China will be able to meet its own pork requirement and also export surplus. So while the live hog market in the U.S. could face some backlash from these sanctions, it won’t be long before they see a drop in demand anyway. This may in fact be the last time that this is used as leverage in negotiations.Soybeans: The hog market is closely linked with the soy market because soybeans being high in protein are widely used to feed the pigs.This is probably why Bunge Ltd (BG  -  Free Report), the largest dealer in soybeans for animal feed, saw its shares plunge 5.2% so far in March.For soybean farmers in the U.S., things don’t look so good. Not only will they be affected by weak hog production in the U.S., but if China doesn’t buy from them to feed their own pigs (or make edible oil), there will be weak demand all round.The Chinese are in conversations with Argentina and Brazil for soybean imports that they might supplement or replace U.S. production with. Notably, both these countries have been granted temporary exemption from Trump’s recently-announced steel and aluminum tariffs. A prolonged drought in soybean producing areas of Argentina may further support U.S. actions.Sorghum: Chinese customs data reportedly shows that 4.76 million tons of the total 5 million tons of sorghum imported by China in 2017 came from the U.S. This is another grain used as cattle feed in China that farmers can get relatively cheap. It is also used to make a popular Chinese liquor.Possibly in reaction to the Trump administration’s tariff on Chinese solar panels and washing machines, last month, the Chinese government initiated an investigation into sorghum imports to see if there was “dumping” at subsidized rates. The investigation will be carried out for the period from November 1, 2016 to October 31, 2017. An investigation of industrial injury will be for the period from January 1, 2013 to October 31, 2017, according to a statement from the Chinese commerce ministry.This isn’t the first time that China has tried taking action against U.S. agricultural products. Last year, it levied anti-dumping and countervailing duties on distiller grain imports of 42.2%-53.7% and 11.2%-12.0% from January 12, 2017 for 5 years.Aerospace-Defense: The broader defense-aerospace market may not be as affected as Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) because of its growing dependence on China and the fact that China is currently its largest customer. Last year, during the President’s visit to China, the company announced a $37 billion order for 300 aircraft.Last September, Boeing forecasted that China would buy a trillion dollars’ worth of planes over the next 20 years. Boeing has admitted that China is growing into the largest market for aircraft and that one in every four planes it produces goes to China.Technology: Some have argued that Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), because its phones are assembled in China, alone accounts for a large chunk of the $ trade deficit with China. But IHS Markit estimates its total components cost at $370.25, of which $110 goes to South Korea’s Samsung Electronics for displays, $44.45 goes to Japan's Toshiba Corp and South Korea's SK Hynix for memory chips with the remaining split between various suppliers inTaiwan, Europe and the U.S. and China’s labor contractors, which account for only around 3-6% of the value.As Adam Jourdan of Reuters points out, “Using a rough calculation…the iPhone 7 series added $15.7 billion to the U.S. trade deficit with China last year, about 4.4 percent of the total. That's also about 22 percent of the $70 billion in cell phones and household goods the U.S. imported from China.”HP (HPQ  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report) are other technology companies likely to be affected by a trade war. Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) has even more to lose than just trade as Chinese regulators are the only ones remaining to approve its NXP Semiconductor (NXPI  -  Free Report) buyout.Last WordAmericans will of course see rising prices on any items that include components from China (the government is increasing tariffs on 1,300 items after all!). So anything from shoes to electronics to furniture could soon be more expensive.There is this huge argument about the wisdom of using tariffs that increase hardships for your own people and there’s some merit in that too. But one does wonder what else can be done under the circumstances, when previous administrations have done what they could without changing anything with respect to Chinese intellectual property theft, blocking of U.S. companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google in China and reducing its dependence on the U.S. all the while.China’s communist government is building a capitalist state. It will do everything possible to get there so the Chinese can compete effectively with everyone else. Until that happens, it will continue to use its population as leverage in negotiations. It’s time to call their bluff.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2808,HPQ,"We have always maintained that the power of Apple Inc.’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) loyal customer base should not be underestimated.StreetInsider has cited a recent report by Rosenblatt China Technology wherein analyst Jun Zhnag said that Apple sold 6 million units of the pricey iPhone X model over the Black Friday weekend alone. Since its launch, iPhone X has sold over 15 million units, added the report.Moreover, the demand for 256 GB iPhone X, priced at $1,150, was double that of the 64 GB model that costs $1K. The hefty price tag was a concern for many analysts but it seems that is it not going to be a deterrent for consumers.  iPhone X production is also ramping up with 3 million units per week produced currently and is expected to increase by another one million by December, per the report.Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Apple Inc. QuoteApple’s radically overhauled iPhone X was anticipated to be a super cycle and it seems like it is turning into one. Apple is expected to sell a whopping 30 million iPhone X units this quarter, per Rosenblatt. However, for the March quarter, the analyst has reduced unit sale estimates by 5 million to 40 million.Apple releases its new models in September and the December quarter usually sees high sale activity. In the year-ago period, Apple sold 45.5 million units of iPhone. However, reportedly, it looks like Apple is set to witness a record breaking quarter wherein it is expected to sell 80 million iPhone units.For the current quarter, Apple expects sales to be in the range of $84 to $87 billion compared with $78.4 billion reported in fiscal first-quarter 2017. Higher average selling price should significantly contribute to this. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $85.8 billion.There are also speculations that robust iPhone X sales will make Apple the first company to touch the $1 trillion valuation mark. Currently, Apple’s market cap is nearly $870 billion. Its shares have increased about 46.3% year over year and hit a 52-week high of $176.24. Shares are currently trading at $169.48.Per a recent report by GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives, as quoted by Investor’s Business Daily, the iPhone X cycle could help Apple reach the milestone figure as early as next year.Apart from iPhone X, the analyst adds that the fast booming Services business and the rebound in China could propel Apple to new highs. A cash pile of $250 billion could help Apple make strategic acquisitions (Netflix, Walt Disney, Tesla and the rumors go on) and carry on with its gigantic shareholder return plan.Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Groupon Inc (GRPN  -  Free Report), Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) and HP Inc (HPQ  -  Free Report).

2811,HPQ,"The number of earnings reports will drop off notably next week, with just 162 companies confirmed to report. This compares to more than 600 reports this week. Nonetheless, profit results will continue to have influence on the direction of the markets with the likes of Dell (DELL), Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) reporting. 
"
2812,HPQ,"Of course, earnings reports are never released within a vacuum of information and next week will be no different. The economic calendar is booked with inflation reports (PPI on Tuesday and CPI on Thursday), FOMC minutes (Tuesday), New York Fed manufacturing index (Wednesday), industrial production and utilization (Thursday) and October housing starts (Friday). Given that the psychology of the financial markets continues to be very data-dependant, both the equity and bond markets could be volatile next week.
"
2813,HPQ,"Data-dependency can help move stocks, as we have seen major equity indexes rise in response to what has been a good third-quarter earnings season. More companies have beaten expectations than missed. However, some of the choppiness in the markets this week can be attributed to reports that havent been as good as what weve seen over the past several weeks. Specifically, within the Zacks Rank universe1, there were 287 positive surprises and 244 negative surprises this week. The higher proportion of negative surprises caused the ratio of positive to negative surprises for third-quarter earnings season to decline to 1.7:1. (A week ago, the ratio stood at 1.96:1).
"
2814,HPQ,"Growth expectations, however, remain pretty much intact with analysts predicting the average company within the Zacks Rank universe to generate 21.4% growth this year. Looking out into next year, expect 12% growth2.

2815,HPQ,"Companies That Could Surprise During the Week of Nov 13-17
"
2816,HPQ,"Big Lots (BIG  -  Free Report) will be one of several retailers to report earnings next week. While I will resist the urge to talk about the possibility of a big surprise, I will point out a very bullish change in earnings estimates. Following announcement of a 5.8% increase in October same-store sales, two of the four covering analysts raised their forecasts for third-quarter results. The current consensus estimate calls for a loss of four cents per share. The most recent consensus is more bullish at a loss of three cents per share. In comparison, the month-old forecast calls for a loss of seven cents per share. (Forecasts for both 2006 and 2007 profits have also been recently raised.) BIG has topped expectations for two consecutive quarters by an average margin of 9.5 cents. Big Lots will report on Thursday, Nov 16. 
"
2817,HPQ,"Limited Brands (LTD) generated same-store sales growth of 9% in October. Based on this data, the company recently raised its forecast for third-quarter earnings to a range of five to seven cents per share. (Previously, LTD had projected breakeven results). Analysts had been ahead of the curve, having adjusted their forecasts for third-quarter earnings upward over the last 60 days. The consensus estimate now calls for profits of seven cents per share. (Forecasts for 2006 and 2007 earnings have also been rising.) LTD has topped expectations for three consecutive quarters by an average margin of five cents. Limited Brands will report on Wednesday, Nov 15, after the close of trading.
"
2818,HPQ,"Those investors looking for a trading opportunity within the tech sector may want to keep their eyes on Nuance Communications (NUAN  -  Free Report). The provider of speech and imaging solutions recently raised its guidance for both fiscal fourth-quarter revenues and losses. NUAN expects GAAP revenues to come in a range of $126 million and $128 million, instead of its previous guidance for sales between $116 million and $120 million. GAAP losses should total between a penny and two cents per share instead of three cents per share. Two of the three covering analysts adjusted their forecasts accordingly to a loss of a penny per share. NUAN has topped expectations during six out of the past seven quarters. Nuance Communications will report on Tuesday, Nov 14, after the close of trading.
"
2819,HPQ,"Target (TGT  -  Free Report) generated same-store sales growth of 3.9% last month. Although the majority of analysts did not change their projections following the announcement of the October data, two analysts did raise their forecasts. The adjustment resulted in a most recent consensus for the third quarter of 55 cents  a penny above the consensus estimate. TGT topped second-quarter results by a penny, but missed first-quarter results by a penny and matched fourth-quarter 2005 results, so this call is admittedly a bit gutsy. Target will report on Tuesday, Nov 14, before the market open.
"
2820,HPQ,"Analog Devices (ADI  -  Free Report) could miss expectations when it reports next week. In late October, the company warned that revenues would be slightly below its previous guidance because of a decline in sales of chipsets for cellular handsets. Analysts cut their forecasts for fiscal fourth-quarter earnings in response, causing the consensus estimate to fall by three cents to 36 cents per share. The most recent consensus, however, is more bearish at 35 cents per share. ADIs fiscal third-quarter earnings were a penny below expectations at 39 cents per share. Analog Devices will report on Tuesday, Nov 14, after the close of trading.

2827,HPQ,"HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) recently unveiled HP LaserJet Pro M15 and M28 series, the smallest laser printer targeted at the owners of small and micro businesses. The new models, which can fit in a small space, are aimed at providing efficient printing experience.These can print about 18 to 19 pages per minute and can be operated via the HP Smart App. Per the press release, the printers are also capable of supporting “Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) AirPrint; Google (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Cloud Print, Mopria-certified and Wi-Fi Direct.”Notably, with the rise in short-term contractual and freelancing jobs, business structures are witnessing changes. Per a recent article by World Economic Forum, around 99% of the private sector in the United Kingdom comprises small businesses.With the changing requirements of the business world, the easy-to-carry mobile printers are much in demand. We believe the lucrative features of the company’s “lowest priced” printers will drive demand going ahead, thereby boosting its top line. Notably, the printers will be available in the market after April 2018.HP Inc. Price HP Inc. Price | HP Inc. QuoteHP in Printing    After its split from parent company Hewlett-Packard in November 2015, HP’s efforts to revamp the printing business have been encouraging.The company acquired Samsung Electronics’ printer business, which seems to be a strategic fit for HP. It has expanded the company’s printing business, with the addition of 6,500-plus printing patents owned by Samsung.Additionally, the company is also making efforts to solidify its 3D printing business capabilities. HP is currently focusing solely on industrial markets in this respect unlike 3D Systems (DDD  -  Free Report) and Stratasys. This is where HP lags these two companies currently.Nevertheless, the company’s efforts are showing results as it registered the fourth consecutive quarter of print business revenue growth in first-quarter fiscal 2018. We believe these continued attempts will enable the company to keep up the momentum going ahead.HP carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)  stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

2828,HPQ,"After a blockbuster 2017, the year so far has been highly volatile with the market witnessing a massive sell-off in early February due to fear of faster-than-anticipated rate hikes by the Fed in 2018. Since then, it has seen many ups and downs, and we expect the market to trade sideways and remain turbulent due to Trump’s aggressive “Economic Protectionism” policies.After announcing the imposition of an import tariff of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium, earlier this month, the Trump administration is now gearing up to take on China's technology and telecommunications sectors, per media sources. The latest tariffs have triggered fears across the globe about a likely trade war, particularly between the United States and China.All these activities have dominated the attention of investors, overshadowing the upbeat U.S. GDP and unemployment data, consequently keeping the stock market highly strained. And it gets very difficult to make the right investment move in such a dismal scenario.Undervalued Stocks With Growth PotentialIn the current scenario (highly volatile market situation) one should look for stocks that are undervalued but have bright growth prospects.

2829,HPQ,"HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) is one of those technology companies that have been demonstrating remarkable share price performance. HP is one of the two companies which came into existence post the split from the parent company — Hewlett-Packard Company — in November 2015. The other company was Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report). The company has generated high returns for investors in the year-to-date period.The stock has been clocking solid returns since the split and has surged approximately 70.8%, substantially outperforming the S&P 500’s growth of 32.2%. The major part of the rally has been witnessed this year. In a year, the stock has appreciated 34.5%, while the S&P 500 has advanced 16.3%.Let’s analyze the reasons behind this impressive surge in share price and consider why HP will continue its momentum in the near-term as well.PC Business RevivedPost the split, HP adopted a strategy of focusing on product innovation & differentiation, pricing, and marketing and sales activities to trigger demand for its PC products in the market. The company has launched various models under its PC product lines of EliteBook, Spectre and Pavilion Wave, in the last two years.The impact of these initiatives is well highlighted by the fact that the company has regained the pole position in the PC segment by displacing Lenovo. Also, according to data compiled by IDC, during fourth-quarter 2017, the company’s PC shipments registered the seventh quarter of consecutive year-over-year growth after witnessing several quarters of decline.Furthermore, the two independent research firms — Gartner and International Data Corporation — hinted that the PC industry has been moving toward stabilization. Therefore, we believe stabilization in PC shipments will benefit business prospects of companies like HP.Revamping Print SegmentThe company’s efforts to revamp printing business have also been commendable. It should be noted that HP has acquired Samsung Electronics’ printer business. The acquisition is a strategic fit for HP as it has expanded the company’s printing business, with the addition of 6,500-plus printing patents owned by Samsung.In addition to the above, the company is now focused on fortifying its 3D printing business capabilities. However, unlike 3D Systems (DDD  -  Free Report)    and Stratasys (SSYS  -  Free Report), which target all kinds of consumers, HP is emphasizing only on industrial markets due to their ability to afford a premium range of 3D printing solutions. It should be noted that even though HP has been operating in this space for almost five years now, it still lags behind 3D Systems and Stratasys.However these efforts have paid off well with the company registering the fourth consecutive quarter of print business revenue growth in first-quarter fiscal 2018.Also, the company’s last quarterly results reflected revenue growth for the sixth consecutive quarter after witnessing a prolonged period of decline. Further, the Personal Systems and Print segments improved for the fourth straight quarter after 2010.Stock Still UndervaluedThe stock currently trades at a forward earnings estimate at 12.2x, which is way lower than the industry average of 15.3x. Given its recent track record of revenues and earnings growth, as well as the long-term forecast, the stock is highly undervalued which signifies that it is still left with significant upside potential.Moreover, HP has a VGM Style Score of A. We note that our VGM score highlights the determining elements in a stock that can push the stock price higher. We can essentially filter out the negatives and focus on the positives which drive price.Consequently, we consider HP as one such technology stock that investors should consider for near-term opportunities. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2830,HPQ,"Viasat Inc.  is offering its satellite communications service based on ViaSat-2 — the world’s most advanced communications satellite — for government, defense and military applications. The service also includes innovative ground networking technologies, with significant performance advantages over any other commercial or U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) SATCOM system.Earlier this month, Viasat conducted a ViaSat-2 SATCOM system demonstration for the U.S. armed forces, where the satellite system demonstrated the industry's fastest broadband connections, exceeding 100 Mbps.Emerging U.S. government needs call for bandwidth-intensive, cloud-connected military applications and the innovations in the new ViaSat-2 satellite and network can dramatically improve operational capabilities for military missions, ensuring superior reach, promptness, and resiliency for global military forces.ViaSat-2 is a $625-million high-capacity satellite launched by the company in June 2017. Viasat’s latest satcom network is powered with greater bandwidth and higher resilience, redundancy and active cyber protection. This will maximize operational performance in the conflicted environments that military operations face during combat.ViaSat-2 is expected to have twice the bandwidth and seven times more broadband coverage over ViaSat-1. Some other features which make it more powerful than ViaSat-1 include high-capacity connectivity, smaller gateway antenna and twice as many gateways.Viasat is already building its next-generation high-capacity satellite system — ViaSat-3 — which is likely to expand its network worldwide.The satellite business is a burgeoning space and is one of the fastest growing segments of the $350-billion space industry. Significant demand for higher speeds of broadband connectivity in residential, in-flight and government markets are likely to boost Viasat’s momentum in the near term. Viasat’s shares have returned 23.2% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s rally of 18.1%.In recent quarters, Viasat’s earnings have suffered due to R&D expenses. The primary dampeners are the ViaSat-3 payload, pre-flight development and testing, commercial in-flight connectivity, STCs as well as line-fit activity. This indicates that we can expect more pressure on profits in the upcoming quarters.Further, the costs related to the ViaSat-2 service launch activities and preparations for the large-scale in-flight Wi-Fi ramp are expected to dent the bottom line in the upcoming quarters. The company anticipates heavier advertising activity over the next several quarters, which will raise costs and hurt margins.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderViasat carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space include HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report), Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report) and Harris Corporation (HRS  -  Free Report), each holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2831,HPQ,"Viasat Inc.’s  solid-state, fully-electronic phased array flat panel antenna has been chosen by SES Networks for the O3b mPOWER satellite communications (satcom) system. The flat panel antenna will be employed in a new generation of customer edge terminals for several applications on the O3b network and improve the delivery of satellite-based connectivity globally.Viasat's antenna technology culminates years of commercial innovation and investment in research and development (R&D). It is a compact, lightweight solution for fixed as well as mobile broadband terminals and is scalable. The antenna will allow SES Networks to target different types of users with varying broadband connectivity requirements.The Viasat phased array leverages proprietary flat panel core technology, which includes a new radio frequency integrated circuit and a modular approach that supports multiple types of user terminals (ranging from residential broadband to in-flight Wi-Fi to connected car and backhaul applications)  to meet increasing broadband connectivity demands.In February, Viasat rolled out the fastest satellite internet available in the United States, powered by the new ViaSat-2 satellite system. ViaSat-2 is a $625-million high-capacity satellite launched by the company in June 2017. The satellite also powers fast in-flight Wi-Fi for JetBlue, American Airlines, United Airlines and other commercial carriers and government customers. ViaSat-2 satellite system provides service to North America, Central America, the Caribbean and a small part of northern South America.ViaSat-2 is expected to have twice the bandwidth and seven times more broadband coverage. It is a massive improvement over ViaSat-1. Some other features which make it more powerful than ViaSat-1 include high-capacity connectivity, smaller gateway antenna and twice as many gateways. Viasat believes that these advanced smaller gateways can help it place the latest satellites in proximity of popular Internet access points, delivering greater network reliability and security.Viasat is already building its next-generation high-capacity satellite system — ViaSat-3 — which is expected to expand its network worldwide.The satellite business is a burgeoning space and is one of the fastest growing segments of the $350-billion space industry. Significant demand for higher speeds of broadband connectivity in residential, in-flight and government markets are likely to boost Viasat’s growth momentum in the near term.In recent quarters, Viasat’s earnings have suffered due to R&D expenses.

2832,HPQ,"Per Steven Milunovich, an analyst with UBS, Apple Inc’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) iPhone unit sales in 2018 could be lower than expected, given the “flat” buying intent in many countries, reports Investor’s Business Daily. However, revenues are likely to be cushioned by higher average selling price of premium iPhone models (iPhone X).Subsequently, he slashed his iPhone unit sales growth estimate to 10% from 12% projected earlier. However, he has retained the “Buy” rating on the stock.Investor’s Business Daily quoted the analyst saying, “Phone buying intent vs. a year ago for the next 12 months is flat in the U.S. and Japan and down in the U.K., China and Germany. If the survey is correct regarding more muted near-term unit growth, the Apple narrative could shift toward monetizing the large iPhone base.""Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Apple Inc. QuoteThere has been tremendous excitement surrounding iPhone X. It is widely considered to be a super cycle. The sale of this edition is expected to be boosted xby features like a glass body, a dual curved edge-to-edge OLED (organic light-emitting diode) display with wireless charging (USB-C), higher storage options and a far superior camera.There are also speculations that robust iPhone X sales will make Apple the first company to touch the $1 trillion valuation mark. Currently, Apple’s market cap is nearly $894 billion. Its shares have increased about 50.3% year over year and hit a 52-week high of $176.24. Shares are currently trading at $174.09.Per a recent report by GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives, as quoted by Investor’s Business Daily, iPhone X cycle could help Apple reach the milestone figure as early as next year.Apart from iPhone X, the analyst adds that the fast booming Services business and the rebound witnessed in China could propel Apple to new highs. A cash pile of $250 billion could help Apple make strategic acquisitions (Netflix, Walt Disney,Tesla and the rumors go on) and carry on with its gigantic shareholder return plan.iPhone continues to be the mainstay of Apple’s revenues. The revolutionary iPhone, released in June 2007, changed the world forever and catapulted Apple to new highs. The success of iPhone over the last decade is well chronicled.Reportedly, Apple has sold over 1.2 billion iPhones across the globe, earning over $760 billion in revenues.Since the first iPhone release, Apple shares have skyrocketed compared with the industry to which it belongs. Over the last decade, Apple stock has returned 898.6% while the industry witnessed a rally of 424.9%.At present, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Groupon Inc (GRPN  -  Free Report), Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) and HP Inc (HPQ  -  Free Report).

2834,HPQ,"India recently regained its position as the fastest growing economy in the world outshining China. The Indian GDP grew at 7.2% year over year in the October-December 2017 quarter fueled by strong performance in the manufacturing and services sectors. This is the highest quarterly growth recorded since July-September quarter of 2016. It also surpassed the street estimate of 6.9%. Meanwhile, China’s GDP grew at 6.8%.India is likely to become the fifth largest economy in the world in 2018. The country has a massive population of which 70% are below the age of 35 and are highly tech savvy. Consequently, the potential growth prospects of the U.S. tech companies are very high as these command strong presence in India.Economic Reforms Pay-OffPrime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration has undertaken several administrative reforms in the last four years. Initially, these reforms, especially demonetization and imposition of GST (Goods and Services Tax) resulted in economic fluctuations in last two to three quarters. However, all those reforms have finally started to yield results.During the December quarter, the gross valued added (GVA) for manufacturing grew at 8.9% compared with 6.9% in the previous quarter. The agricultural sector GVA grew at 4.1% compared with 2.7% in the previous quarter.The construction sector recorded growth of 6.8% outpacing previous quarter’s growth of 2.8%. The services segment including financial services grew at rate of 6.7% from 6.4% in previous quarter. Moreover, infrastructure output grew 6.7% year over year in January 2018.Momentum Likely to ContinueNotably, in November 2017, the government of India received a shot in the arm, as the country for the first time secured a place in the top 100 of the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business (EDB) global rankings. According to the World Bank, between Jun 2, 2016 and Jun 1, 2017, India improved in nine out of 10 categories in making processes easy for doing business.According to the World Bank’s Global Economic Prospects in January 2018, Indian economy is likely to grow at 7.3% in 2018. The country is going to register higher growth rate than other major emerging market economies over the next decade. The World Bank stated strong private consumption and services are expected to continue to support economic activity.In February 2018, Moody’s Investors Service has projected India’s GDP growth rate at 7.6% for 2018 and 7.5% for 2019. In November 2017, Moody’s Investors Service upgraded India’s sovereign bond rating for the first time in nearly 14 years. The rating agency was optimistic about structural reforms undertaken by the Modi administration is likely to boost growth and reduce the debt burden. Moody’s lifted India’s rating to Baa2 from Baa3 and changed its rating outlook to stable from positive as “risks to its credit profile were broadly balanced”.Moreover, in its World Economic Outlook Update in October 2017, the IMF (International Monetary Fund) retained India’s growth projections at 7.4 per cent for the next financial year (2018-19). Growth is anticipated to moderate gradually in China but will pick up in India, and remain broadly stable in the Asean-5 region.Why Tech Stocks?Currently, India is home to a young and tech savvy population which represents strong growth prospects for tech majors. These “millennials” are the key drivers for growth of Internet-based applications, e-commerce and mobile-transaction related software.Notably, India has a population of 1.234 billion. The millennials have a strong appetite for new technologies. As this group will comprise 75% of the workforce by 2025, India surely emerges as a long-term investment bet for tech giants.In December 2017, per a report by National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM), the market size of Internet industry in India is likely to reach $250 billion by 2020, growing to 7.5% per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP). The number of Internet users in India is expected to reach 730 million by 2020, supported by fast adoption of digital technology.The public cloud services market in India is slated to grow 35.9% to reach $1.3 billion according to IT consultancy, Gartner in February 2017.

The telecom industry has attracted FDI (foreign direct investment) worth $24.033 billion between April 2000 and June 2017, according to the data released by Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP).Our Top PickIndia has exhibited tremendous resilience in times of global uncertainty. Improving current account deficit, a recovery in private investment, introduction of the GST, and a stable monetary policy are major positives for the economy.Given India’s significantly young population and vast scope for expansion in tech related areas, key companies in this domain enjoy strong business prospects.

Last quarter, the company reported an adjusted loss of 20 cents, lagging estimates by a massive 281.8%. The bottom line was dragged by top-line decline as well as a disproportionate rise in cost of sales.3D Systems Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise 3D Systems Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | 3D Systems Corporation Quote Also, 3D Systems’ earnings estimates have moved south in the past month, indicating a bearish analyst sentiment for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings has been revised downward from a loss of 4 cents to a 5-cent loss over the past 30 days due to a downward estimate revision versus none upward.Over the last six months, shares of 3D Systems have underperformed the industry. The stock has plunged 26.1% against the industry's positive return of 9.9%. Factors at PlayIn the third quarter,the company had conducted a deep and extensive review of inventory based on year-to-date demand, customer data and market trends, and had also recorded a significant adjustment to the same. Moreover it implemented organizational changes to improve execution and increased investments as it shifts to a worldwide go-to-market structure.Despite a steady momentum of healthcare offerings, robust demand for production printers and materials plus higher efficiency in “demand manufacturing services”, 3D Systems is apprehensive of a rough ride in the near future. The industry is battling a widespread decline in demand for enterprise 3D printers over the past two years. Other headwinds including economic slowdown, inflation, currency fluctuations and commodity price vagaries also marred the performance of most players in the industry.Nonetheless, we still believe the acquisition of Vertex-Global Holding B.V to unlock multiple opportunities for the billion-dollar digital dentistry space. Also, the company’s efforts to streamline its cost structure by focusing on IT infrastructure, go-to-market and innovation are likely to stoke growth.Given the numerous challenges grappling 3D Systems, the company has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the same space are HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report), Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report) and Harris Corporation (HRS  -  Free Report), each holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2839,HPQ,"In a sudden move, Meg Whitman has decided to step down as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report), leaving the company in the middle of its restructuring phase to cut costs and focus on high-margin businesses. The move led to deep unrest among investors, causing shares to plunge around 7% on Nov 22.Coming to the price performance, the stock has lost 3.1% in the past year, wider than the industry’s decline of 2%.Whitman has been replaced by Antonio Neri who also serves as the current president of HPE.  Whitman will continue to function as a member of Board of Directors in HPE. Antonio will function as the CEO of HPE effective from Feb 1, 2018. Whitman, who will sign off as the CEO stated, ""Antonio's ready, the company's ready, and it's the right time.""She further added, ""Neri has been with the company since 1995, working his way up to the company's top ranks.”Whitman has served the company since 2011 and successfully witnessed the company’s split into two. In fact, under Whitman’s leadership, HPE has achieved a major milestone in becoming a stronger, more focused company, which can compete and win in today’s market.Under Whitman’s leadership, the company restored its balance sheet, strengthened operations and enhanced customer satisfaction.  Post separation from HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report), the company also made innovative moves to focus and strengthen portfolio. Moreover, Whitman orchestrated the spin off and mergers of HPE’s Enterprise Services and Software businesses, as well as strategic acquisitions including Aruba, SGI, SimpliVity and Nimble Storage.HPE’s TroubleRecently, the company reported not-so encouraging fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny while the top line missed the same. Moreover, the view provided by the company was also not worth an applause.HPE expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 20-24 cents (mid-point: 22 cents), which was lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 27 cents.The company also provided outlook for fiscal 2018. HPE expects non-GAAP earnings per share for fiscal 2018 in the range of $1.15-$1.25 (mid-point $1.2). The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $1.17.We remain slightly cautious about the company’s near-term prospects due to the three main challenges it is currently facing — heightened pressure from unfavorable currency exchange movements, elevated commodities pricing and some near-term execution issues. These headwinds are expected to thwart its overall performance in the near term.Further, macroeconomic challenges and tepid IT spending remain other concerns. Competition from International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) adds to its woes.Moving ForwardNeri, in his new role, will continue to focus on strategic initiatives, key customer relationships and technology development. In our opinion, if any one that could succeed Whtiman, the name is Antonio. Neri’s appointment is a sound choice, given his profound experience in the company over the years. We expect the new CEO of HPE to better understand the overall strengths and weaknesses of the business as he has in-depth knowledge of the market dynamics.Currently, HPE carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2840,HPQ,"Whether you describe the current period of market movement as a period of correction, digestion or the opening stages of a new bear market, market movement has not been particularly comforting. However, there is evidence some of the things this market is missing will return, and also that some it counts on will surprise to the upside. Read on to discover what evidence the Experts believe point to strength in the market and how to best make investment decisions in a choppy trading environment while preparing for growth and a rising market.Could Jobs Return?
"
2841,HPQ,"One of the critical accelerators of the sell off in March was the disappointing February jobs number released by the Labor Department. The addition of a mere 21,000 jobs that month fell far short of the 125,000 additional jobs predicted. All of those jobs were accounted for, entirely, by public sector job additions. Aside from the obstinately loose labor market, personal incomes also disappointed, rising at a pace just short of consumer inflation for the last couple of years. 
"
2842,HPQ,"Adam Oliensis, editor of the Agile Trader , has evidence that one or both of these trends might be in the process of changing. Not only does Oliensis apply his technical analysis skills to the indices and individual stocks, but also to trends in economic data. Last Fridays Personal Income and GDP data demonstrated that the ratio of Corporate Profits to Wages and Salary Accruals rose 1.1% on a quarter over quarter basis to 18.6%. Essentially, corporations are booking almost 18.6% as much as they pay out in wages. 
"
2843,HPQ,"On an absolute basis, that would seem to point to a certain degree of corporate charity and beneficence towards workers. However, Salaries and Wages as a percentage of GDP dropped to new cyclical lows at 45.9%, down from the bull market peak of 49.4% in 1Q00. In fact, the Corporate Profits to Wages and Salaries ratio is now at 3.5 standard deviations above the 56-year mean. For those of you who need a quick reminder on statistics, 95% of all events lay within 2 standard deviations from the mean, or average. Essentially, less than one percent of all events occur 3.5 standard deviations from the mean. For instance, since 1991, the NASDAQ has NEVER closed 3.5 standard deviations above or below its 20-day moving average.
"
2844,HPQ,"The high levels of corporate profits relative to wages are due to a confluence of factors including a cost-cutting binge, incredibly low corporate tax rates, and stronger than expected economic growth. It is possible the ratio could be rebalanced through new hiring or increases in wages. Essentially, this is evidence that companies are covering the costs of employment, benefits, etc. However, they act upon this surplus relative to profits.  This piece of data remains simply more evidence that the labor market is incredibly weak at the expense of American workers. Jobs data comes in on Friday, wait and see.Earnings a Positive Again
"
2845,HPQ,"Earnings estimates, strikingly, continue to be a positive for this economy and market. Consensus earnings estimates for the S&P 500 for the 1st quarter of 2004 stand at $14.54/share, which represents a 17% increase on a year over year basis. That stands 5% above the 12% consensus estimate from November 11 of last year. According to Oliensis, on average, earnings estimates tend to come in a little more than 3% above estimates. As such, there is a strong likelihood that actual earnings could demonstrate as much as 20% growth on a year over year basis. Even more reassuring, earnings could also demonstrate growth from the 4th quarter of 2003 to the 1st quarter of 2004, which is a rare result. Typically, the 4th quarter is much stronger than the 1st quarter due to the strength of the holiday season and the nature of companies who need to spend budgets before the fiscal year ends.
"
2846,HPQ,"The Calendar Year 04 estimate for the S&P 500 rose 2.3%, to $62.97 over the last 4 months, which would represent 15% year over year growth. Further, earnings estimates for each quarter rose over that period. Forward 52 weeks operating earnings estimates is currently $64.83, which moves the PE down to 17.1. Trailing 52 week operating earnings now stands at $56.52, and the PE moved to 19.6 on this number. Based on Oliensis models, using 4.75% as his target for the 10-year Notes Dividend Yield, fair value now stands at 1,365 on the S&P 500. With a 0.5% Risk Premium built in, Oliensis has a target for 1,235. Oliensis sees at least 11% upside potential on the market.Stock-Picking Tips
"
2847,HPQ,"Jim Oberweis edits the  Oberweis Report , which, according to the Hulbert Financial Digest that monitors the performance of newsletter recommendations, has the best 5-year performance of any newsletter monitored. Oberweis applies the Oberweis Octagon to pick his stocks, and, obviously it has worked for him, his readers and those who invest in the mutual funds managed by the Oberweis research team. In his March and April issues Oberweis focused on the first four of the eight tenets of the Oberweis Octagon.
"
2848,HPQ,"The first two focus on proof of solid growth with the guidelines: 1) Look for consistent, rapid growth in sales around 30% that is internally generated; and 2) Look for similar consistent growth in pretax income and earnings per share. Companies that are on the rise to establishing themselves as leaders within their own industries will typically display significant sales growth, and that rate is evidence they are doing something right. Rule 1.1, according to Oberweis, could be to compare the sales growth rate of that company to its industry. Consistent and rapid sales growth also is evidence of internal growth, as opposed to growth through acquisitions. The second rule provides a metric to ensure that the business is being managed in an efficient way. In other words, if a great deal of pretax income is being spent on gluttonous expansion, the stock is probably not a good investment.
"
2849,HPQ,"This month, Oberweis discussed his second two guidelines for identifying megastocks: 3) Buy stocks whose P/E ratios are not greater than one-half of the companys rate of growth; and 4) Look for companies with products or opportunities for substantial future growth. Rule 3 is an explanation of the PEG, which is indexing the Price to Earnings ratio for Growth. The example Oberweis offers is a question: Would you rather buy a stock trading at 20x earnings and growing at 30% a year, or a stock trading at 30x earnings and growing at 60% a year? The answer is the stock trading at 30x earnings, because the PEG is only 0.5 vs. 0.66 for the first stock. The 4th tenet of the Oberweis Octagon is a more subjective recommendation, but nevertheless. Put yourself in the past and think about the products that leave you scratching your head saying, Gosh, I cant imagine how the world would be without this product.

2856,HPQ,"HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) has come up with another quarter of stellar performance. The company reported better-than-expected results in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 and revenues increased for the fifth-consecutive quarter after an extended period of decline. Also, the Personal Systems and Print segments have improved for the third-straight quarter after 2010.In fact, the company’s outstanding results for the last few quarters substantiate  that the spin-off from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) coupled with restructuring initiatives is finally paying off for HP.HP’s total revenues increased 11% year over year to $13.927 billion and outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.246 billion. The better-than-expected top-line performance was driven mainly by strength in the Personal System and Printing segments along with the successful launch of products.The company’s bottom-line results were also impressive, wherein its non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of 44 cents per share matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The figure came toward the higher-end of management’s earlier guidance range of 42-45 cents. On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP earnings improved 22.2%.Despite reporting better-than-expected results and strong top-line growth, shares of HP have declined over 5.5% during yesterday’s after-hours trading. The downturn was owing to the company’s soft first-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP earnings guidance range, which at mid-point is slightly lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Moreover, Meg Whitman, CEO of its sister company, HPE, announced her retirement yesterday. During her six-year tenure, she initiated a number of turnaround strategy but most of them failed to gain traction. We believe the news might have turned investors a little cautious.Consequently, HP’s shares have underperformed the industry year to date. While the stock has been up 44.7%, the industry to which it belongs gained 46%.Quarter in DetailThe Personal Systems segment generated revenues of $9.084 billion, up 13% year over year.  While commercial revenues increased 11%, consumer revenues were up 18%.Printing revenues were up 7% year over year to $4.877 billion, primarily owing to a 10% increase in supplies revenues. HP’s total hardware unit sales grew 3% backed by Consumer hardware units increase of 3%. Commercial hardware units, however, remained flat on a year-over-year basis.Region wise, revenues from Americas were up 10% year over year. While revenues from Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) grew 11%, the same from the Asia Pacific and Japan region increased 16% year over year, all in constant currency.However, gross margin contracted 20 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 18.1%, primarily due to elevated commodity costs of Personal Systems. This was partially offset by better margin in the printing segment backed by improved productivity and higher supplies mix.Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 6% year over year to $1.5 billion.Non-GAAP operating margin from continuing operations remained flat year over year at 7%. HP’s non-GAAP net income from continuing operations came in at $749 million compared with $614 million reported a year ago.HP Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise HP Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | HP Inc. QuoteBalance Sheet and Cash FlowHP ended the fiscal fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $6.997 billion compared with $6.967 billion in the previous quarter. The company had long-term debt of $6.747 billion compared with $6.744 billion last quarter.The company generated cash flow of $680 million from operational activities during the quarter.

The company now anticipates non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations in the band of $1.75-$1.85 (previously $1.74-$1.84). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.78 per share.For the fiscal first quarter, HP projects non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations in the range of 40-43 cents per share (mid-point: 41.5 cents). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 42 cents.Our TakeWe are impressed by the performance of HP’s PC segment, wherein the year-over-year increase can be attributed to growth in Commercial and Consumer revenues. Additionally, the company’s  efforts to turn around its business have been commendable. Meanwhile, the company is working on product innovation, differentiation and enhancing the capabilities of its printing business to stabilize the top line.The latest PC shipment data by IDC depicts that HP’s restructuring initiatives such as focus on product innovations, pricing, marketing and sales activities, divestment of non-core assets and cutting jobs to lower costs are paying off. Per the data compiled by IDC, the company witnessed year-over-year shipment growth for the sixth quarter in a row, after registering decline for five consecutive quarters.With the start of shipping A3 multifunction printers to more than 80 countries, which covers all its key markets, HP is likely to revive its printing business and grab a bigger share in the inkjet printer market. Also, the acquisition of Samsung’s printing business is anticipated to support the development and manufacturing of printers.However, macroeconomic challenges and tepid IT spending remain near-term concerns. Competition from the likes of International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report) and Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) adds to its woes.HP currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

One major stimulus behind the rally is the “The Instagram Effect.” This widely used photo-sharing application has largely driven sales of premium compact digital cameras, offering much better image than smartphones.Industry View Robust growth prospects have triggered business rivalry in the digital camera market. Fujifilm Holdings Corporation, Panasonic Corporation, Canon, Inc. (CAJ  -  Free Report), Sony Corporation (SNE  -  Free Report), Leica Camera AG, Nikon Corporation, Olympus Corporation and HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) are the major players in this space.In order to grab a larger portion of market demand, these camera makers are launching high-end models and have raised near-term top-line forecasts. For instance, Canon, Inc. anticipates year-over-year sales growth of 8% for 2017. The company noted that its compact digital cameras and interchangeable lenses are currently witnessing better-than-expected sales. Sony Corporation has raised its sales view by nearly 10.5% for fiscal 2018 (ending March 2018). Sony claims that demand for its Alpha mirrorless cameras has been improving in recent quarters. Nikon and Panasonic have also elevated their near-term sales guidance.Fujifilm Riding High In August, Fujifilm rolled out the VISION2019 program through which it intends to boost near-term profitability on the back of increased cash-flow generation, propel growth in prime business domains and develop new high-margin businesses. On the back of these, the company aims to generate revenues worth ¥2,600 billion, operating income of ¥230 billion and net income of ¥150 billion in fiscal 2020.We believe that strategic business acquisitions (like the Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd. buyout in April 2017) and new operational-efficacy improving programs (such as the Work Style Innovation program) will boost the company’s top and bottom-line performance. Notably, Fujifilm predicts that the future of the digital camera industry is highly dependent on demand of major emerging countries such as China and India. In sync with this, the company intends to tap greater share of the Indian mirrorless camera demand by promoting its Fuji GFX system and premium range of X Series cameras, going forward. In addition, the company’s 4K broadcast lenses are likely to secure sturdy response in the county in the near future.In the VISION2019 program, the company stated that its Imaging Solutions segment will generate roughly ¥380 billion revenues and ¥45 billion operating income by the end of fiscal 2020.We believe that the aforementioned moves will largely help Fujifilm withstand competition in the high-end digital camera market. However, the photomask industry is highly dynamic in nature. The possibility of a rival outpacing competency with a new product or marketing strategy remains a concern.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2860,HPQ,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because HP Inc. is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for HPQ in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 45 cents per share for DE, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for HPQ, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.68% heading into earnings season.HP Inc. Price and EPS Surprise HP Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | HP Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that HPQ has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for HP Inc., and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2861,HPQ,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is 3D Systems Corporation (DDD  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in DDD.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen eight estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from earnings of 44 cents a share a month ago to its current level of a loss of 4 cents.Also, for the current quarter, 3D Systems has seen two downward estimate revisions versus no revision in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 2 cents a share from earnings of 18 cents over the past 30 days.   The stock has also seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 29.7% in the past month.3D Systems Corporation Price and Consensus 3D Systems Corporation Price and Consensus | 3D Systems Corporation QuoteSo it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don’t have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Computer - Mini computers industry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock - HP Inc.

2862,HPQ,"Due to several headwinds, NCR Corporation’s (NCR  -  Free Report) chances of offering favorable returns in the near term are slim. Hence, this is the best time to dump the stock.The stock has lost 13.7% in the past three months, underperforming the industry, which has witnessed a gain of 0.32%. Let’s delve deeper and try to find out what is taking this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company down.Estimates Moving SouthAnalysts have become increasingly bearish on the stock over the past couple of months. With four estimates moving down against no upward revision in the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings has declined from $1.11 per share to 86 cents.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings declined from $3.37 per share to $3.14, over the same time frame.Disappointing GuidanceNCR also lowered its revenue and earnings outlook for 2017 in third-quarter 2017 results. Additionally, the fourth-quarter guidance was disappointing.For the year, the company now anticipates revenues in the range of $6.475-$6.525 billion, lower than previous guided range of $6.63-$6.75 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $6.68 billion. The lower revenue guidance was primarily due to weakness in the ATM market.Non-GAAP earnings per share are now anticipated in the range of $3.10-$3.20, lower than the previous guided range of $3.32-$3.42. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.37. The decrease in earnings per share was mainly due to lower ATM hardware and attached software licenses.The company now expects operating cash flow in the range of $745-$775 million (previous guidance: $805-$830 million).  Moreover, free cash flow is now anticipated to be between $440 million and $470 million (previous guidance: $500-$525 million). The decrease in the cash flow outlook was mainly due to lower revenues.For the fourth quarter, NCR expects revenues in the range of $1.74-$1.79 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.93 billion.The company expects non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter in the range of 83-93 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.11 per share.This makes us cautious about the company’s near-term prospects.Low ReturnGiven the other downsides like low return on assets (ROA) and low return on capital (ROC), the stock looks very unappealing. NCR currently trades at a ROA of 7.3%, much lower than the industry average of 11.7%. Notably, the company has an ROC of 12.5% compared with the industry average of 18.3%.Growth ImpedimentsNCR has a highly leveraged balance sheet. The company had a long-term debt position of $2.98 billion while had a cash and cash equivalents of just $405 million at the end of third-quarter 2017. Thus, it had to constantly generate adequate operating cash flow to service its debt.Moreover, competition from Diebold Inc. (DBD  -  Free Report) and HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) remain concerns.A Stock to ConsiderA top-ranked stock in the broader technology is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.NVIDIA has a long-term EPS growth rate of 11.2%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2863,HPQ,"In today’s investing world, especially among retail investors, searching for growth stocks seems to have become paramount. The rise of tech powers like Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) only furthers this push to find companies that could jump from a small venture-funded firm to a $500 billion behemoth.Of course, growth investing can be fun and exhilarating, but investors might also consider looking for stocks that present outsized value in this growth-obsessed market.One company that currently offers investors outstanding bang for their buck is HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report).HP, a maker of desktop PCs, printers, laptops, tablets, and other electronic mainstays, is in the midst of a solid run over the last two years. Shares of the company have soared over 44% so far this year, including a 12.25% jump in the last 12 weeks alone.On top of this, HP is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system, and the consumer electronics power’s Growth and Momentum scores help it earn an overall VGM grade of an “A.”Now let’s take a look at why HP might be a great play for investors in search of value.Fundamentals Many investors will look to the tried and true price to earnings ratio as the first indicator of a company’s value.HP is currently trading at 12.09x earnings, which marks a discount compared to the “Computer – Mini computers” industry’s average. HP also presents a better value compared to rivals Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Lenovo (LNVGY  -  Free Report), which sport P/E ratios of 15.64 and 17.85, respectively.HP also demonstrates why it is currently a strong value play with its great price to sales ratio. The company’s 0.71 P/S ratio marks over a 36% discount compared to its industry’s 1.12 average. And when investors compare HP to Apple’s 3.90 price to sales ratio, the electronics maker looks even better.HP Inc. PS Ratio (TTM) HP Inc. PS Ratio (TTM) | HP Inc. QuoteValue investors will also be happy to know that HP currently presents a dividend yield of 2.68%.Lastly, just so growth-minded investors aren’t scared off too quickly by the notion that HP is only a value investment, the company’s earnings are expected to jump 22% when it reports its fourth-quarter results on Nov. 21—based on our current consensus estimates. What’s more, HP’s revenues are projected to climb nearly 6% to hit $13.25 billion.Zacks' Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public, certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services.

2866,HPQ,"Shares of CA Inc. (CA  -  Free Report) slumped 3.9% in after-hours trading, yesterday, after the company reported not-so-encouraging second-quarter fiscal 2018 results.The company posted non-GAAP (excluding stock-based compensation and other one-time items) of 62 cents, which came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Further, reported earnings also declined nearly 7% on a year-over-year basis.CA's shares yielded a negative return of 6.4% in a year against the Zacks industry's gain of 33%.Quarter DetailsAlthough CA’s reported revenues of $1.034 billion increased 2% on a year-over-year basis, it missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.051 billion. On a constant currency basis, revenues were up 1% year over year. The increase can mainly be attributed to acquisition synergies (from Automic Holding GmbH and Veracode, Inc.) an increase in software fees.However, the company notified that revenues and “velocity in sales outside of the renewal cycle of Enterprise Solutions products” was below expectations.Revenues from Subscription and maintenance (80% of total revenues) increased marginally 0.2% and revenues from Professional Services (7% of total revenues) were flat year over year. However, Software fees and other revenues (13% of total revenues) surged 11.8%.Moreover, on a segment basis, revenues from CA’s Mainframe Solutions declined 2% on a year-over-year basis to $539 million. Revenues from Enterprise Solutions increased 7% on a year-over-year basis to $420million, while Services revenues were flat year over year and came in at $75 million.Both North America and International revenues increased 0.3% and 4%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis in terms of local currency. However, the company witnessed 1% slump in total bookings. Per the press release, “Total bookings decreased due to a decline in renewal bookings.”Moving on, CA reported non-GAAP income from continuing operations before interest and income taxes of $392 million, down 4% year over year. As a percentage of revenues, non-GAAP income from continuing operations before interest and income taxes was down 200 basis points (bps) to 38%, primarily due to higher operating expenses.Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 6% year over year to $642 million, while as a percentage of revenues, it increased 240 bps year over year to 62.1%. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to expenses related to Automic and Veracode acquisitions.The company’s non-GAAP net income from continuing operations was approximately $263 million as compared with $283 million reported in the year-ago quarter.CA exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2.822 billion compared with $2.771 billion in the previous quarter. The company’s total long-term debt (including current portion) came in at $2.785 billion. During the quarter, the company provided $37 million in cash from operating activities.During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.8 million shares worth $90 million. The company also approved $560 stock repurchase program as of Sep 30, 2017. CA paid $108 as dividends during the quarter.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceCA updated its fiscal 2018 guidance. The company continues to expect total revenues to increase 4% in constant currency. Total revenues are now anticipated to increase 5% in reported basis. This translates reported revenues to $4.22-$4.25 billion at Sep 30, 2017 exchange rates. Previously the company anticipated revenues to increase 4% on a reported basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 revenues is pegged at $4.21 billion.The company continues to anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations to be flat to 2% in reported as well as in constant currency basis. According to the company, “At September 30, 2017 exchange rates, this translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.42 to $2.48.” The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 is pegged at $2.45 per share.The company continues to expect non-GAAP operating margin to be in the range of 36-37%, Non-GAAP effective tax rate is anticipated to be in the range of 28-29%, unchanged from the previous guidance.The company now expects cash flow from operations to increase in the range of 2-6% on reported and flat to 4% in constant currency basis. Previously the company projected cash flow from operations to be in the range of 1-5% on reported basis. Considering the exchange rates as of Sep 30, 2017, this translates to the range of $1.10-$1.15 billion.Our TakeCA reported not-so-encouraging second-quarter results. However, it provided a positive view for fiscal 2018.We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by the company will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model.CA has also adopted a “go to market” sales strategy. This brings together all the commercial functions including sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight. The integration of the marketing functions helps to lower costs, consequently improving the bottom line.Apart from pursuing growth through acquisitions, the company is leveraging cloud computing to enable organizations to source the best components — internal, external, private cloud, public cloud, mobile and more — to construct the most competitive business applications without wasting much time and resource.The company is also focused on providing advanced management and security software required by organizations to take complete advantage of this evolution.Meanwhile, increasing competition from Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report) and HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) along with exposure to Europe remain the near-term headwinds.CA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana. Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2867,HPQ,"In just a blink the first half of the first quarter is over. December earnings are now firmly in the books, and 2004 doesnt seem quite as shiny as 2003 to many investors. A year ago, investors were still suffering the hangover from the party that was the latter half of the 90s. A second-half recovery was optimistically predicted and many were willing to call a total capitulation to the bear market that dominated the first few years of the new millennium. Stocks currently sit at valuation levels that presume continuing success and growth, yet many companies guidance, during first quarter earnings reports calls for back-end loaded earnings that could result in disappointments, and punishment for stock-prices. The message is not that a second dip is coming in the sense that the recession and bear market appeared but rather the strategies utilized to kick-start the economy present a new set of challenges and demand a slightly different posture to your portfolio. Moderate Outlooks
"
2868,HPQ,"Ben Zacks, editor of the Zacks Advisor , notes that the market is currently very near full valuation. EPS growth for the S&P 500 in the 3rd and 4th quarters of 2003 was 28% and 23%, respectively. Aggregate earnings growth for 2003 should come in, when all is said and done, around 18%. Estimates for 2004 currently sit around 13% with all 4 quarters showing about that level individually. Unfortunately, according to Zacks, a number of companies note that the majority of their earnings growth for the year will be back half loaded. The trouble is that the year over year comparisons for those two quarters will be incredibly difficult given the blockbuster performance of the second half of 2003.
"
2869,HPQ,"For Zacks, the problem is that the back half of this year is a giant question mark. Many of the strategies used to create earnings growth after the recession and bear market could result in chickens coming home to roost. No Interest offers on balance transfers for credit cards and automobiles as well as billions of dollars of credit created for consumer spending will likely dampen consumer spending in the near future. Further, the tax rebates received in the third quarters and the fact that mortgage rates will only go higher, which removes the refinancing option, will take money out of pocketbooks.
"
2870,HPQ,"Aside from the consumer, the market is having trouble discounting six for interest rates, the dollar, oil prices and unemployment. Zacks says the market is first and foremost a discounting mechanism that seeks to predict information that will come over the next six months. The trend-less nature of the market over the last several is evidence to him that the second half of 2004 represents a big question mark. 
"
2871,HPQ,"With the market trading around 19x earnings, the question of how much upside is left before a significant correction is poignant. Zacks felt the market performed very rationally around the end of the 3rd quarter and through the 4th quarter. In spite of an improving earnings picture, it did not give way to serious speculative trading. Certainly, 5 weeks of losses on the NASDAQ and rotation back into the Medical and Oil sectors are evidence that investors prefer more of a defensive posture. But, if companies cant produce earnings to expectations, their stock prices will likely be pummeled. Regardless, Zacks feels the market is well overdue for a 5-7% correction and feels, If, however the market shrugs off the present uncertainty and begins a new up leg without a period of true digestion or any significant catalyst, then I would begin to seriously question, and view with extreme skepticism, what would be a newly speculative tone.Defensive Posture
"
2872,HPQ,"Zacks currently counsels adopting a more defensive posture in your portfolio. He currently advises investors to take some profits in more speculative and aggressive holdings. Zacks is rotating toward the Medical and Consumer Staples sectors, and is currently overweight each of them. Nevertheless, diversity is the key to any healthy portfolio, and he recently added the following two stocks to his Focus List.
"
2873,HPQ,"Zacks added Broadcom (NASDAQ: BRCM ) to the Focus List. Broadcom is involved in the development of integrated circuits for data and broadband communications. The company revised its revenue guidance for next quarter to 16-18% on Wednesday, February 18, up from 10%. The company reported 62% sales growth in the 4th quarter of 2003, and its new products, which include Bluetooth Wireless and WLAN technologies are expected to drive as much as 100 basis point gross margin improvement in the first quarter. Analysts followed the company's guidance with higher earnings estimates for all of 2004 and 2005, and the stock added sorely needed exposure to broadband to the Zacks Advisor Focus List. 
"
2874,HPQ,"Zacks also added computing and printing behemoth Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: (HPQ  -  Free Report) ) to the Focus List. The company reported 30% EPS growth on the 19th, on 9% revenue growth year over year, though they were down 2% on a quarter over quarter basis. HP is a $73 billion market cap company and trades at a very reasonable multiple of about 16x 2004 earnings. It operates around the world and in a number of markets, including digital imaging, which many of its competitors, including Dell and Gateway, are working to break in to. Personal Systems were up 20% year over year, and the company's enterprise segment posted a profit for the first time ever. In spite of speculation about the success of the merger between HP and Compaq, the CEO Carly Fiorina is demonstrating the ability of the combined entity to execute and Zacks thinks it will continue improve its position as it goes forward. Shares yield 1.2%. Greenspans Patience
"
2875,HPQ,"Walter Frank, editor of Moneyletter echoes many of Zacks points in the expectation for what he terms A Wintery Pause. Frank feels that last year around this time, it was fairly easy to argue that earnings estimates were fairly low across the board. Analysts were sick of being burned by companies failing to hit consensus estimates, and Frank felt analysts and companies were low-balling guidance. Frank feels that it would take economic or earnings news that far outpaced forecasts to drive the market higher than current valuation levels, which are priced for growth.
"
2876,HPQ,"Frank does feel, though, the Fed has a strong grip on interest rates and has now balanced the risks between inflation and deflation through the aggressive rate-cutting campaign, and now expects price stability to set in. Unless the economy heats up significantly, Frank does not expect a rate increase until after the election. However, he expects the economy to continue to cool, or remain as cool as it is, which is what will likely stoke the correction. In other words, he doubts that employment will improve significantly or investment spending to pick up at a pace that would force the Fed to raise rates.Slow & Steady on the International Front
"
2877,HPQ,"Walter Frank currently recommends the Dodge & Cox International Stock Fund (DODFX ) to investors. The firm attempts to find stocks that are trading at a discount due to being out of favor with investors for one reason or another. The managers attempt to only add stocks they expect to hold for at least three years with long term growth catalysts. The fund caps expenses at .90%. It is focused 45% in small and mid-cap stocks. 26% of the stocks in the fund are Japanes, with the next greatest concentration at 9.9% in the United Kingdom. On an industry basis, the fund favors consumer discretionary, materials and financials, which account for 26.5%, 17.9% and 17.7% respectively. The fund gained 49.4% in 2003, and 69.8% in the twelve months trailing February 13th. Continued Caution
"
2878,HPQ,"Preparing for a correction is similar to saving up for the holiday season. You have to avoid indulgences and be careful with your money, but the buying opportunities that come in the wake can be REALLY EXCITING. Market rise and fall; that is their nature.  It would be wise, according to the Experts, to position yourself in preparation for a correction and Wish List for the stocks that will be on discount in the corrections wake.

2882,HPQ,"On Friday, shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. (HPE  -  Free Report) are plummeting, down over 20% in midday trading after the company announced the spin-off of almost all of its software business.Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s software business, which includes the popular and widely used security platform ArcSight, has now been merged with British software company Micro Focus International, which trades on the London Stock Exchange under the ticker “MCRO.”“With the completion of this transaction, HPE has achieved a major milestone in becoming a stronger, more focused company, purpose-built to compete and win in today’s market,” said Meg Whitman, Chief Executive Officer of HPE.  “And, this transaction will deliver approximately $8.8 billion to HPE and its stockholders.”Today’s deal also marks the end of the company’s 2011 acquisition of British firm Autonomy, which Hewlett scooped up for $11 billion. At the time, the acquisition was to help push HPE forward as an enterprise software industry leader, but the deal was heavily criticized, and according to Reuters, Hewlett ended up taking an $8.8 billion writedown on it.Hewlett’s next step, though, will be to quickly build up its software division, especially for its mixed data center areas. The company has also had to adjust to the change in enterprise software, as cloud computing services offered from competitors like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) dominate the market.HPE was created in 2015, along with HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report), as a spin-off from the Hewlett Packard Company. The company currently sits at a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM score of ‘C.’More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2883,HPQ,"ATM and POS manufacturer, NCR Corporation (NCR  -  Free Report) announced that it has inked a deal with Performance Food Group Company (PFGC  -  Free Report), the food and food-related products distributor, targeting the restaurant industry.Per the deal, Performance Food Group (PFG) will implement NCR’s cloud-based point-of-sale (POS) platform, NCR Silver, to restaurants in the United States. However, the financial details of the deal were kept under wraps. Leveraging NCR's restaurant technology, which includes hardware and software technology, PFG’s will help better serve its customers by reducing transaction time along with offering them loyalty discounts and promotions.The POS solution helps restaurant staff to take orders and execute them faster. The solution also helps to process bill payment fast, thus cutting down waiting time for patrons. With NCR Silver: Table Service, customer retention, acquisition of new customers, streamlined operations/food services, and staff training becomes simpler for restaurant owners.An increasing number of people are now opting for this mode of payment as it does not require middlemen, transaction fee or the need to disclose identity to complete a transaction.NCR Silver will be useful for U.S.-based merchants as they can turn their tablet into a complete POS system that can run on numerous devices. Subscription of NCR Silver core app and NCR Silver Pro Restaurant Edition are supported on Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) iOS and Android platform devices.NCR POS: Massive Growth OpportunityThe demand for NCR’s POS solution is growing among retailers and hospitality industries as it facilitates the automation of bill payment and accounting. As a result, managers get ample time for customer interaction, leading to increased productivity. NCR strengthened its position in the POS market through the acquisition of Radiant Systems in August 2011.According to Global Market Insights, the global market size of POS terminals will reach $103.52 billion by 2023. The report also says that market size of POS terminals, which at the end of 2015 was 32 million units, will reach 126 million units by 2023, reflecting a CAGR of 18.3% through the period.Another research firm stated that the global POS terminal market, valued at $42.14 billion in 2015, is expected to reach $113.27 billion by 2024. Consequently, NCR with its varied offerings of POS terminals and solutions should be able to capitalize on these growth opportunities.Bottom LineNCR stock has gained 3.3% year over year, substantially outperforming the 12.5% decline witnessed by the industry it belongs to.NCR’s growing exposure in the ATM and self-service kiosk space is encouraging, given the tremendous prospects in the respective markets. Continuous product launches, growing popularity of its self-service offerings and synergies from acquisitions are catalysts. Continuous deal wins also drive growth.Softness in the ATM business in mature markets, competition from Diebold Inc. (DBD  -  Free Report) and HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) and a high debt burden remain concerns.Currently, NCR carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!

2884,HPQ,"At times, it is prudent to retain certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions. HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) seems to be one such stock, which investors need to hold on to if they are looking to reap long-term benefits. Though the stock faces a few headwinds at the moment, these are transitory in nature. There is enough scope for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to rebound in the long run.In fact, HP stock has gained 30.8% year to date, substantially outperforming the 19% rally of the industry it belongs to.Further, shares of the company went up almost 3% yesterday and to eventually close at $19.41.Aspects In Favor of HPIt seems that the spin-off from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report), along with restructuring initiatives, is apparently paying off at last for HP, as evident from its last few quarterly results. The company not only reported better-than-expected results for third-quarter fiscal 2017, but also continued revenue growth for the fourth consecutive quarter after several quarters of decline. The quarter also marked back-to-back growth for both Personal Systems and Print segments in the same quarter since 2010.HP also raised lower-end earnings guidance range for fiscal 2017. The company now anticipates non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations in the band of $1.63-$1.66 (previously $1.59-$1.66). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.64 per share.HP’s efforts to turn around its business have been commendable. The company is working on product innovation, differentiation and enhancing the capabilities of its printing business to stabilize the top line.Per Gartner, HP managed to regain the top position by replacing Lenovo in the second quarter. Further, this was the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment growth for the company, following five back-to-back quarters of underperformance. Going forward, the research firm IDC’s forward looking statement indicates that the PC industry is moving toward stabilization. The aforementioned positive comments on the PC market will benefit the business prospects of HP.With the start of shipping A3 multifunction printers to more than 80 countries, which covers all its key markets, HP can revive its printing business and grab a bigger share in the inkjet printer market. Further, the acquisition of Samsung’s printing business is anticipated to support the development and manufacturing of printers.The company exhibits a VGM Style Score of A and has an expected EPS growth rate of 2.9%. Notably, the stock has delivered positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 1.9%.From a valuation perspective, the stock looks attractive as it currently trades significantly lower than the industry average based on a forward earnings estimate. This signifies huge upward potential. HP currently trades at a forward P/E of 11.8x compared with the industry group average of 15.0x.Risks PersistHowever, macroeconomic challenges and tepid IT spending remain near-term concerns. Competition from the likes of International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report) and Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) adds to woes.Our TakeWe expect the aforementioned factors to help the company sustain its strong momentum and stay afloat amid difficult times. Hence, we suggest that investors hold on to the stock for the time being.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

2885,HPQ,"It seems that the spin-off from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report), along with restructuring initiatives, is apparently paying off at last for HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report), as evident from its last few quarterly results. The company not only reported better-than-expected results for third-quarter fiscal 2017, but also continued the revenue growth momentum for the fourth consecutive quarter after several quarters of decline. The quarter also marked back-to-back second time in a row where both Personal Systems and Print segments have grown in the same quarter since 2010.HP’s total revenues increased 9.8% year over year to $13.060 billion and outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.077 billion. The better-than-expected top-line performance was driven mainly by strength in the Personal System and Printing segments, along with the successful launch of products.The company’s bottom-line results were also impressive, wherein its non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of 43 cents per share came a penny ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate, as well as matched the upper-end of management’s earlier guidance range of 40-43 cents.Despite reporting better-than-expected results and strong top-line growth, shares of HP fell nearly 1.4% during yesterday’s after-hour trade. This may be due to the fact that the company’s GAAP and non-GAAP earnings failed to mark year-over-year improvement. Apart from this, a lower-than-expected earnings guidance range for the fiscal fourth quarter might also have turned investors cautious.Notably, HP’s non-GAAP earnings came in lower than the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 48 cents. On a GAAP basis, the company posted earnings from continuing operation of 41 cents, down from 49 cents reported in third-quarter fiscal 2016. The year-over-year decline in bottom-line results was stemmed by elevated costs and expenses, which were partially offset by higher revenues and reduced share counts.HP’s shares have underperformed the industry to which it belongs to in the year-to-date period. While the stock has returned 27% in the said period, the industry gained 37%.Quarter in DetailThe Personal Systems segment generated revenues of $8.404 billion, up 12% year over year.  Commercial revenues increased 11%, while Consumer revenues were up 14%. The company witnessed a 7% rise in total shipments, driven by a 12% increase in Notebook unit shipment. Desktops unit shipments were down 3% on a year-over-year basis.Printing revenues were up 6% year over year to $4.698 billion, primarily due to a 10% increase in supplies revenues. HP’s total hardware unit sales inched up 1% owing to an increase of 1% in Consumer hardware units. Commercial hardware units, however, remained flat on a year-over-year basis.Region wise, revenues from Americas were up 8% year over year. EMEA revenues grew 14%, while the Asia Pacific and Japan region increased 15% year over year, all in constant currency.Gross margin expanded 30 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 18.6%, primarily driven by better margin in the printing segment backed by improved productivity and higher supplies mix. However, elevated commodity costs of Personal Systems partially offset the aforementioned benefit.Non-GAAP operating expenses flared up 35% year over year to $1.4 billion.Non-GAAP operating margin from continuing operations contracted 170 basis points to 7.7%. The contraction can be attributed to escalating costs and expenses. HP’s non-GAAP net income from continuing operations came in at $735 million compared with $826 million reported a year ago.HP Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  HP Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | HP Inc. QuoteBalance Sheet and Cash FlowHP ended the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $6.967 billion compared with $6.223 billion in the previous quarter. The company had long-term debt of $6.744 billion compared with $6.710 billion last quarter.The company generated cash flow of $1.775 billion from operational activities during the quarter. HP repurchased shares worth $302 million and paid dividends worth $222 million, in the same time frame.During the first three quarters of fiscal 2017, operating cash flow came in at $2.997 billion, while the company paid $673 million as cash dividend and bought back shares worth $911 million.GuidanceHP raised its lower-end earnings guidance range for fiscal 2017. The company now anticipates non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations in the band of $1.63-$1.66 (previously $1.59-$1.66). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.64 per share.For the fiscal fourth quarter, HP projects non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations in the range of 42-45 cents per share (mid-point: 43.5 cents). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 44 cents.Our TakeWe are impressed by the performance of HP’s PC segment, wherein the year-over-year increase can be attributed to growth in Commercial and Consumer revenues.HP’s efforts to turn around its business have been commendable. The company is working on product innovation, differentiation and enhancing the capabilities of its printing business to stabilize the top line.The recently released PC shipment data by IDC depicts that HP’s restructuring initiatives, such as focus on product innovations, pricing, marketing and sales activities, divestment of non-core assets and cutting jobs to lower costs, are paying off. HP, as per the data compiled by IDC, witnessed year-over-year shipment growth for the fifth quarter in a row, after registering decline for five consecutive quarters.With the start of shipping A3 multifunction printers to more than 80 countries, which covers all its key markets, HP can revive its printing business and grab a bigger share in the inkjet printer market. Also, the acquisition of Samsung’s printing business is anticipated to support the development and manufacturing of printers.However, macroeconomic challenges and tepid IT spending remain near-term concerns.

2886,HPQ,"NCR Corporation (NCR  -  Free Report) reported mixed results for third-quarter 2017. The company’s non-GAAP earnings (excluding restructuring, acquisition-related expenses and other one-time items) from continuing operations of 93 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 90 cents and surged 6.9% year over year.Quarterly earnings also came toward the higher end of the company’s guided range of 88-93 cents. The robust bottom-line performancecan primarily be attributed toefficient cost management and a lower share count.Notably, the stock has outperformed the industry in the last year. NCR’s shares have returned 21.8% against the industry’s decline of 1.4%.RevenuesThe company’s revenues of $1.663 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.683 billion and decreased a marginal 0.8% on a year-over-year basis. The softness in revenues during the quarter was primarily impacted by weakness in the ATM business.Per the company, “ATM orders continue to be negatively impacted by large customer delays in spending in North America, weakness in India, the Middle East and Africa, and the upcoming Windows 10 conversion.”The company’s product revenues came in at $657 million, down 7.2% from the year-ago-quarter. However, service revenues increased 3.8% year over year and came in at $1.006 billion.During second-quarter 2016, NCR modified reportable segments to reflect changes in its structure. The new reportable segments are Software, Services and Hardware segments.The company’s Software revenues on a reported basis were up 2% to $476 million. The increase was primarily due to a 5%, 6% and 3% increase in Cloud, Professional Services and Software maintenance revenues, respectively. Nonetheless, Software license was down 12%. Notably, net ACV during the quarter increased 37% and came in at $16 million in the quarter.Services revenues increased 3% to $609 million on a reported and constant currency basis. The increase was primarily due to hardware maintenance growth.Hardware revenues however decreased 6% year over year on a reported basis to $578 million.The segment revenues from ATM and SCO declined 16% and 24%, respectively, which negatively impacted the overall hardware revenues. However, revenues from POS surged 19%, while that of IPS remained flat on a year-over-year basis. The increase POS revenues were primarily owingto new products rollout and replacements. On a constant currency basis, Hardware revenues decreased 7%.MarginsNon-GAAP gross profit for the quarter decreased 1% and came in at $486 million, primarily due weakness in ATM business and unfavorable revenue mix. Further, the non-GAAP gross margin decreased 10 basis points (bps) to 29.2%, mainlydue to lower software license revenue and reduced hardware margins.Income from operations on a non-GAAP basis was $235 million, up from $230 million a year ago. Also, operating margin expanded 40 bps on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to strong cost control measures, lower employee compensation expenses as well as better productivity.Non-GAAP operating expenses during the quarter came in at $251 million, reflecting an increase from $261 million in the year-ago quarter.Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations was $143 million compared with $135 million in the year-ago quarter.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowThe ATM and POS manufacturer exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $405 million, up from $377 million in the previous quarter. Receivables were $1.41 billion compared with $1.32 billion in the previous quarter.However, NCR has a highly-leveraged balance sheet. The company ended the quarter with $2.98 billion of long-term debt in its book as compared with$3 billion reported in the previous quarter.In the third quarter, the company generated operating cash flow of $133 million and free cash flow was $18 million.The company did not repurchase any share in the quarter under review. However, during the nine months ended Sep 30, 2017, the company repurchased $350 million of its common stock.Disappointing GuidanceNCR reduced revenue and earnings outlook for 2017. Additionally, the fourth-quarter guidance was disappointing.For the year, the company now anticipates revenues in the range of $6.475-$6.525 billion, lower than previous guided range of $6.63-$6.75 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $6.68 billion. The lower-than-expected revenue guidance was primarily due to weakness in ATM market.Non-GAAP earnings per share are now anticipatedin the range of $3.10-$3.20, lower than the previous guided range of $3.32-$3.42 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.37. The decrease in earnings per share was mainly due to lower ATM hardware and attached software licenses.The company now expects operating cash flow in the range of $745-$775 million (previous guidance $805-$830 million).  Moreover, free cash flow is now anticipated to be between $440 million and $470 million (previous guidance $500 million and $525 million). The decrease in the cash flow outlook was mainly due to effect of lower revenues.Coming to the fourth-quarter outlook, NCR expects revenues in the range of $1.74-$1.79 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.93 billion.The company expects non-GAAP earnings per share for the third quarter in the range of 83-93 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.11 per share.Our TakeNCR reported mixed third-quarter 2017 results wherein the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while thetop line missed the same. Also, the company lowered fiscal 2017 outlook and provided disappointing fourth-quarter guidance. The main reason behind such a weak view was softness in ATM market.Hence, the lower-than-expected revenues during the quarter poor guidance impacted the share price movement. Shares of the company went down more than 10% in after-hours trading yesterday.Nonetheless, we expect NCR’s POS platform to be a tailwind. The demand for NCR’s POS solution is increasing among retailers and restaurant owners as it facilitates the automation of bill payment and accounting. As a result, managers get ample time for customer interaction, leading to increased productivity.Global research company RBR recently acknowledged NCR as the world’s #1 POS software provider for the retail and hospitality industries. The recognition reflects NCR’s portfolio strength as well as improving opportunities in the POS market. Moreover, continuous product launches and synergies from acquisitions are catalysts. Additionally, continuous deal wins will drive growth.However, competition from Diebold Inc. (DBD  -  Free Report) and HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report), and a high debt burden remain concerns.Currently, NCR carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the technology sector is Applied Materials, Inc.

2887,HPQ,"Keeping pace with the rapid evolution of technology, HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) recently revealed HP ZBook x2 PC Workstation — the thinnest and most powerful detachable iteration of laptops, at Adobe MAX conference. The new device functions in four modes: laptop, detached, docked and tablet.HP ZBook x2 was showcased especially for experts who use Adobe Creative Cloud (which includes Photoshop, Illustrator, Dreamweaver, Lightroom, InDesign, After Effects, Premiere Pro) and other creative applications most of the time.The company claims that this product is the world's most powerful detachable PC workstation, which is likely to offer the ideal combination of enhanced performance, mobility and price.The new offering provides faster web access, increased durability and is equipped with larger displays. These products will enhance the web experience along with providing high-quality visuals. Moreover, the new line-up will add variety and functionality to some older laptops and workstations, which in turn will be able to attract new clients.Improved Features to Boost Competitive PositionThe device comes with a host of new enhancements among which includes 10 hours of battery life which can recharge around 50% in just half an hour. Powered by Intel Inc.’s (INTC  -  Free Report) seventh generation core processors, the ultra-portable is anticipated to improve the user experience with better connectivity.Moreover, the device supports huge file storage with upto 2 TB (Terabyte) PCIe solid state drive options and NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) Quadro Graphics. It also provides 4K multi-touch display designed to make data handling simpler, more flexible, efficient and cost effective.HP’s ZBook could challenge Dell Inc.’s Ultrabook and Microsoft’s (MSFT) Surface Pro in the rapidly growing market for ultra-portable computers.The new HP ZBook x2 supports the HP-designed pen based on Wacom EMR technology. HP ZBook x2 supports 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity, and offers new tilt support that further refines the Windows 10 Ink experience.The device reduces the latency, which means that the time gap between touching the display with the pen and digital ink showing up on the screen will be significantly shorter as compared with earlier devices.The company’s continuous efforts to roll out new products will help it to seize additional market share. Priced at $1,749, the HP ZBook x2 will be available by December.ConclusionHP retained its leading position during third-quarter 2017, per Gartner. Also, this was the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment growth for the company, following five back-to-back quarters of underperformance. The spin-off from its parent, Hewlett-Packard Company, and restructuring initiatives, such as focus on product innovations, pricing, marketing and sales activities, divestment of non-core assets, and cutting jobs to lower costs, are apparently paying off at last.Gartner stated that among the top five vendors, only HP recorded growth in PC shipment, while Dell, Apple, Lenovo and Asus witnessed declines during the third quarter. With a market share of 30.5%, HP witnessed year-over-year growth of 4.4% in PC shipment.These favorable forecasts along with HP’s effort to roll out new and enhanced products, raises investors’ confidence.However, macroeconomic challenges and tepid IT spending remain near-term concerns.

PE Ratio (TTM) | HP Inc. QuoteWhat are the Growth Prospects?HP’s efforts to turn around its business have been commendable. The company is working on product innovation, differentiation and enhancing the capabilities of its printing business to stabilize the top line.The recently released PC shipment data by IDC depicts that HP’s restructuring initiatives such as focus on product innovation, pricing, marketing and sales activities, divestment of non-core assets and cutting jobs to lower costs are paying off. HP, as per the data compiled by IDC, witnessed year-over-year shipment growth for the fifth quarter in a row, after registering decline for five consecutive quarters.With the start of shipping A3 multifunction printers to more than 80 countries, which covers all its key markets, HP can revive its printing business and grab a bigger share of the inkjet printer market.

2889,HPQ,"FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation (FUJIY  -  Free Report) is eyeing to capture almost half of India’s mirrorless camera market over the next two years.“India has always followed the worldwide trends in photography, where share of mirrorless is increasing and by 2020, higher share is expected”, stated Yasunobu Nishiyama, Fujifilm India Manager. The company’s cameras are currently equipped with an assortment of 25 lenses and it is adding almost four new types of lenses each year. Late this August, per the latest VISION2019 program, the company announced its intention to grab the maximum share of the mirrorless camera market in India by the end of fiscal 2020.Fujifilm Riding HighOver the last three months, Fujifilm’s shares yielded a return of 9.6%, as against the 6.9% loss incurred by the industry.Notably, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock currently flaunts a VGM Score of A. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The company’s projected earnings per share growth and sales growth for fiscal 2018 (ending March 2018) are currently pegged at 0.9% and 2.1%, respectively, as against the 29.9% and 3.2% loss assessed to be suffered by the industry. Notably, over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the stock moved up 4.2% for fiscal 2018 and 6.7% for fiscal 2019.On Aug 30, Fujifilm rolled out the VISION2019 program, through which it intends to boost its near-term profitability on the back of increased cash-flow generation, propel growth of prime business domains, and develop new high-margin businesses. On the back of these moves, the company aims to generate revenues worth ¥2,600 billion, operating income of ¥230 billion and net income ¥150 billion in fiscal 2020. Notably, we believe strategic business acquisitions (like the Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd. buyout in April 2017) and new operational-efficacy improving programs (such as the Work Style Innovation program) are anticipated to reinforce top- and bottom-line performance in the quarters ahead.  Mirrorless Camera Trade in IndiaThe Camera & Imaging Products Association’s report reveals that the global mirrorless camera market share has doubled from 4% to 9.5% from 2012 through 2015. However, future of this industry is highly dependent on the demand of major emerging countries such as China and India. Notably, the Indian mirrorless-camera market has recorded nearly 300% growth so far, outpacing the gain of all other digital-still camera market in the country.Fujifilm intends to fortify its Imaging Solution’s business by capturing the growing mirrorless camera demand across the globe, especially India. However, we notice that robust growth prospects have triggered the degree of business rivalry within the mirrorless camera market. Companies like Panasonic Corporation, Canon, Inc. (CAJ  -  Free Report), Sony Corporation (SNE  -  Free Report), Leica Camera AG, Olympus Corporation and HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) are some major business rivals of Fujifilm in the mirrorless camera business domain.  SonyA7R, Sony Alpha NEX-6, Olympus OM D E M1, Fujifilm X-Pro1, Fujifilm X-A1, Fujifilm X-E1 and Panasonic GX7 are some popular mirrorless camera models in the Indian market. Despite high prices, demand for these cameras has been shooting up in India, stemming from the rise in proportion of enthusiastic photographers in the country. Moreover, these premium gadgets are gaining acceptance due to special features such as fast shooting rates, light weight and interchangeable lenses.  Fujifilm’s StrategyFujifilm intends to tap greater share of the Indian mirrorless camera demand by promoting its Fuji GFX system and premium range of X Series cameras, going forward. In addition, the company’s 4K broadcast lenses are likely to secure sturdy response in the county in the near future.Fujifilm’s Imaging Solutions’ revenues improved 9.2% in first-quarter fiscal 2018. The company noted that the upside was driven by robust sales of Fujifilm GFX 50S and X Series mirrorless cameras, like Fujifilm X-T20.In the VISION2019 program, the company stated that its Imaging Solutions segment will generate roughly ¥380-billion revenues and ¥45-billion operating income by the end of fiscal 2020. We believe its strategy to strengthen the Indian mirrorless camera business is largely in sync with the company’s long-term goals.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

However, the stock declined after the company’s fixed income trading revenue dipped around 27% to come in at $3.2 billion in the third quarter of this year. Meanwhile, Citigroup also reported third quarter earnings, surpassing the market expectations. However, the stock declined after the company’s operating expenses declined about 2% and the cost of credit increased 15% due to global consumer banking as well as high credit reserve build. Such losses weighed heavily on the financial sector.Moreover, weighing on the markets was a decline in shares of AT&T (T  -  Free Report), which lost 5.7%. Such losses followed an announcement from the company that it lost approximately 90,000 video subscribers within the United States in the third quarter in the wake of two big hurricanes and also because of stiff competition in the market. This weighed heavily on the telecom sector.The Dow declined almost 32 points to finish in the red and the Nasdaq ended 12.04 points lower to end in the negative territory.New Economic DataThe weekly initial jobless claims plummeted to 243,000 from last week — a decline of 15,000.

Economists commented that only a few Americans applied for unemployment benefits in this period as business resumed in Texas and Florida, with more people resuming work, post the recent carnage by two destructive hurricanes.Moreover, initial claims in Puerto Rico were also lower not because of people going back to work but due to the absence of electricity after the island was ravaged by Hurricane Maria. Consequently, people could not file claims from the island nor could the claims be processed. As a result, the analysts expect such claims to show up in the coming weeks.Meanwhile, the Core PPI for the month of September increased by 0.4%, up from 0.1% in August. The consensus estimate for the period was 0.2%. However, PPI for September increased by 0.4%, in line with the consensus estimate for the period.Stocks That Made HeadlinesHP Inc Shares Jump on Positive Fiscal 2018 OutlookThe world’s largest PC manufacturer, HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report), provided fiscal 2018 outlook in its recent Securities Analyst Meeting.

2894,HPQ,"The board of Infosys Limited (INFY  -  Free Report) announced a $2 billion share repurchase program a day after the sudden resignation of CEO and MD Vishal Sikka. This move reflects an initiative to improve stakeholder returns for the Indian software exporter, after heightened tensions between the board and the founders led by ex-Chairman N R Narayana Murthy resulted in Sikka’s quitting.Asia’s second-largest software services developer plans to repurchase as many as 113 million shares at Rs 1,150 apiece, per an exchange filing. Investors actually lost $3.5 billion as Infosys’s market value plunged on Friday in the wake of Sikka’s step-down. The repurchase price represents a 25% premium to Friday’s closing price.Despite this generous offer, the shareholders’ response was lukewarm at best.Sikka’s resignation had led to a deep unrest among investors, causing shares to decline 10.8% at one point before paring the losses to end at 7.2% lower. Even now, Infosys shares are continuing their downward trend, having fallen 5.4% in today’s pre-market trading at the time of writing.Simply put, the repurchase price might have appeared more attractive, had Sikka’s resignation the previous day not led to the plummet of Infosys shares to historic lows.Infosys’s shares have lost 6.4% in the past year versus the industry’s 17.8% average gain.Experts opine that Infosys faces a major business disruption due to a high-profile CEO’s exit, bitter ego battles between top management and a co-founder, plus the reputational damage suffered because of a possible securities fraud charge. These factors could affect new business acquisitions in the key markets and allow rivals to grab the company’s existent market share.Also, potential clients may refrain from making deals with Infosys until there is more clarity on who will replace Sikka and what the strategies and vision of the new CEO might be.Sikka had taken over the reins of India’s second-largest software and outsourcing company in June 2014. Over time, he had been instrumental in realigning the company’s consulting business toward strategy consulting. During his term, Infosys had increased its $100 million clients from 12 to 19. The company’s large deal wins rose from $1.9 billion in 2015 to $3.5 billion in FY17.Per news reports, Infosys is struggling with deep rifts formed within the board. Plus, the board’s relationship with the company founders has been splintered. Perhaps, it is time for the company to revamp the board completely in order to restore investors’ confidence.The road ahead for Infosys looks long and difficult. The company needs to begin anew with recruiting the right CEO and MD, which seems a daunting task in the light of a possible disparity between what the founders expect and what the shareholders probably want to see in their new leader.Infosys Limited Price and Consensus Infosys Limited Price and Consensus | Infosys Limited QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderInfosys presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2896,HPQ,"The world’s largest PC manufacturer, HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report), provided fiscal 2018 outlook in its recent Securities Analyst Meeting. The company also provided an update on its turnaround plan and future strategy.Following the announcement, the company’s shares surged nearly 2.5% in after-hours trading.HP’s 2018 ProjectionsFor fiscal 2018, HP projects non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations in the range of $1.74-$1.84 per share (mid-point: $1.79 per share). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.75 per share. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations are expected to be in the range of $1.69-$1.79 per share.Free cash flow is projected to be approximately $3 billion for full year 2018.  The company anticipates returning up to 50-70% of free cash flow to shareholders via dividends and share repurchase in fiscal 2018. Moreover, the company expects to increase quarterly dividends by 5%.Factors in Favor of HPNotably, the stock has had a remarkable run so far this year. In the year-to-date period, HP has surged 37.5%, outperforming 34.4% growth recorded by its industry.According to Dion Weisler, President and CEO, HP, “We are well positioned to lead in the core, accelerate growth opportunities, like A3 and Graphics in Printing and commercial transformation in Personal Systems, and capture the future with 3D Printing in plastics and now metals.”The much awaited pending acquisition of Samsung Electronics’ printer business, for $1.1 billion, recently crossed another milestone after China's Ministry of Commerce gave approval for the transaction, per media sources. This is another factor that provided a boost to the share price movement.The acquisition is a strategic move by HP, as it will expand the company’s printing business as Samsung's printer business has more than 6,500 printing patents. Additionally, the deal will bring in additional 1,300 researchers and engineers, which will support development and manufacturing of HP printers, going forward.The spin-off from its parent, Hewlett-Packard Company, along with restructuring initiatives, such as focus on product innovations, pricing, marketing and sales activities, divestment of non-core assets and cutting jobs to lower costs, are apparently paying off at last.  Although, worldwide PC shipments declined in the third quarter, but, HP retained its leading position during the quarter, per Gartner. Further, this was the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment growth for the company, following five back-to-back quarters of underperformance.Gartner also stated that among the top five vendors, only HP recorded growth in PC shipment, while Dell, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Lenovo and Asus witnessed declines during the third quarter. With a market share of 30.5%, HP witnessed year-over-year growth of 4.4% in PC shipment.The company is also trying to enhance 3D printing business capabilities. It should be noted that even though HP has been operating in this space for almost five years now, the company is way behind 3D Systems Corporation (DDD  -  Free Report) and Stratasys Ltd. (SSYS  -  Free Report).Consequently, in order to fortify its presence in this space, last year, HP unveiled its Jet Fusion 3D Printing Solution with two models to choose from — 4200 and 3200. Unlike 3D Systems and Stratasys, which targets all kinds of consumers, HP emphasizes only on industrial markets due to its ability to afford a premium range of 3D printing solutions.To satisfy customers in this space, HP has collaborated with various companies like Siemens, BMW, Nike Inc. and Autodesk Inc., with an aim to develop more advanced 3D printing technologies for a wide array of industrial use.HP’s efforts to revive printing business have been commendable. Looking HP’s strategies yielding satisfactory results, we feel the company can turnaround the printing business, and claim a bigger share in the inkjet as well as 3D printer market.Bottom LineThese favorable forecasts along with HP’s effort to boost earnings going ahead, raises investors’ confidence.However, macroeconomic challenges and tepid IT spending remain near-term concerns. Competition from the likes of International Business Machines and Apple add to its woes.HP currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2897,HPQ,"The downward trend in the PC industry persisted in third-quarter 2017 as well. According to the recently released worldwide PC shipment data by independent research firms — Gartner Inc. (IT  -  Free Report) and International Data Corporation (“IDC”) — even the back-to-school season failed to lift the PC market.The preliminary data released by Gartner depicts that PC shipments in the quarter were down 3.6% year over year to 67 million units. This also marks the 12th straight quarter of year-over-year fall — the longest duration of decline in the history of PC industry.Though IDC also reported a decline in PC shipments, its reported figures were widely different. Per the research firm, worldwide PC shipment edged down 0.5% on a year-over-year basis and totaled 67.2 million in the third quarter. The decline, however, was lower than IDC’s previous forecast of 1.4%.Although the firms reported a decline in PC shipments, their take on the back-to-school season sales performance is different. Per Gartner, a very weak back-to-school sales season resulted in a 10.3% year-over-year decline in PC sales in the United States, while IDC believes “back-to-school promotions helped boost results”, in the quarter.Chromebook – The Major DifferentiatorIn our opinion, the disparity in data and comments may be due to the different techniques used by the firms for tracking PC sales, as well as the inclusion and/or exclusion of certain products, specially Chromebooks, which run on Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Chrome operating system.Notably, unlike Gartner, IDC includes Chromebooks. Gartner, on the other hand, takes into account Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) tablets and detachable, such as the iPad Pro and the Asus Transformer.According to IDC, Chromebooks continued to witness strong growth, while in a reply to MarketWatch’s mail, Mika Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner said that “they did notice “strong growth” for the devices in the quarter, especially in the U.S.”Escalating Prices Upsetting DemandAlthough the firms chose different data-compilation techniques, both highlighted almost similar reasons for the plunge. Both agreed that shortage of key components, including DRAM, SSD and LCD panels, has been flaring up PC prices, in turn thwarting the overall demand. Per Gartner, DRAM shortages worsened during the third quarter when compared with the first half of 2017.Mika Kitagawa observed that to counter higher component cost situation “most vendors generally pass the price hike on to consumers, rather than absorbing the cost themselves”, which adversely affected the overall PC market.Computer - Peripheral Equipment Industry 5YR % Return Computer - Peripheral Equipment Industry 5YR % ReturnRegion-Wise PerformanceTalking about the geographical performance, the firms agreed that overall PC shipments across every region dropped during the quarter. However, as per IDC, which reports Japan’s sales separately, the country witnessed year-over-year growth for the fifth consecutive quarter.Per Gartner, PC shipments in the United States dipped 10.3% year over year to 14.7 million units, primarily due to poor consumer PC demand, partially offset by stable demand in the business segment. Nevertheless, the firm noted that business PC demand “could slow down among SMBs due to PC price increases due to component shortages.""PC shipment in Europe and the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) edged down 1.1% year over year to 19 million units, according to Gartner. The research firm also mentioned that the declining trend in Western Europe is slowing down, therefore it anticipates a potential stability in the last quarter of 2017. In Eastern Europe, Gartner didn’t notice any remarkable positive influence from the Windows 10 migration and thus, demand is not improving.In Asia/Pacific, PC shipments dropped 2.1% year over year to 24 million units, mainly due to dismal demand for consumer PCs, partially offset by steady demand for business PCs, per Gartner. The research firm noted a 5% PC unit sales decline in China.In Japan, the PC industry continued to display strength, according to IDC. Per the firm, “Japan traditional PC market showed stable growth in 3Q17, primarily driven by refresh projects and migration to Windows 10 as well as further notebook adoption.”Top Vendors ListHP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) retained its leading position during the quarter, per Gartner. Also, this was the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment growth for the company, following five back-to-back quarters of underperformance. The spin-off from its parent, Hewlett-Packard Company, and restructuring initiatives, such as focus on product innovations, pricing, marketing and sales activities, divestment of non-core assets, and cutting jobs to lower costs, are apparently paying off at last.Gartner stated that among the top five vendors, only HP Inc. recorded growth in PC shipment, while Dell, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Lenovo and Asus witnessed declines during the third quarter. With a market share of 30.5%, HP Inc. witnessed year-over-year growth of 4.4% in PC shipment.Lenovo, on the other hand, registered a 1.5% decline and has a market share of 21.4%. Dell holds the third spot, with a market share of 15.2%, and witnessed a 0.4% decline.Apple and Asus also registered year-over-year decline of 5.5% and 9%, respectively. However, in terms of market share, Apple lost its fourth position to Asus, with respective shares of 6.9% and 7.3%.In the top vendors’ list, IDC has a slightly different opinion. While HP Inc., Lenovo and Dell are the top three vendors here also, the research firm has different names for the fourth and fifth position. Per IDC, Apple is in the fourth spot, while Asus holds the fifth position.What’s Ahead?Though both research firms reported a year-over-year decline in global PC shipments, the forward looking statements indicate that the PC industry is moving toward stabilization.IDC’s Loren Loverde, program vice president, Worldwide PCD Trackers, said “The traditional PC market performed much as expected in the third quarter."" He further added, ""Emerging markets rebounded slightly more than anticipated, but overall results reflect the stabilization we expected following component and inventory adjustments. The outlook for the fourth quarter remains cautious, likely with a small decline in volume for the quarter and the year. The gains in emerging regions and potential for more commercial replacements represent some upside potential, although we continue to expect incremental declines in total shipments for the next few years.""Furthermore, Gartner does not include Chromebook shipments in data compilation, which is showing tremendous growth. Last year, Chromebook shipments grew a whopping 38%, while the total PC market dipped 6%.In the second-quarter PC shipment report, Ms. Kitagawa had said, “The Chromebook is not a PC replacement as of now, but it could be potentially transformed as a PC replacement if a few conditions are met going forward.” She further added “For example, infrastructure of general connectivity needs to improve; mobile data connectivity needs to become more affordable; and it needs to have more offline capability”.The aforementioned positive comments on the PC market by the two industry experts will provide a respite to the PC vendors, as well as the companies which are dependent on the PC industry.An improving trend in PC shipments will benefit the business prospects of companies like HP Inc., Microsoft, Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report), Seagate Technologies (STX  -  Free Report) and Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report), which continue to depend substantially on PC sales.Currently, HP Inc. and Intel, both carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2898,HPQ,"The much awaited pending acquisition of Samsung Electronics’ printer business by HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report), for $1.1 billion, crossed another milestone after China's Ministry of Commerce gave its approval for the transaction, per media sources. However, the deal comes with certain conditions which are meant to restrict the company from monopolizing the domestic laser printer market.Per Reuters, the Ministry of Commerce restricts HP from buying even a minority stake in any other A4 printer manufacturers in the country. The regulatory body also forbids the company to “not adapt its printers to restrict compatibility with third-parties or claim in advertising that its printers are not compatible with other suppliers.” Additionally, HP has to report its pricing and other related data to the ministry every six months, reported the news agency last Thursday.Notably, since the news surfaced, shares of HP have gained approximately 1.6%. The stock has had a remarkable run so far this year. In the year-to-date period, HP has surged 38.6%, outperforming 33.3% growth recorded by its industry.It should be noted that HP made this acquisition deal in September 2016, in an effort to turn around its printer business. With the Chinese government giving its nod, the company anticipates to close the deal in the fourth quarter of this calendar year.The acquisition is a strategic move by HP, as it will expand the company’s printing business as Samsung's printer business has more than 6,500 printing patents. Along with this, the deal will bring in additional 1,300 researchers and engineers, which will support development and manufacturing of HP printers, going forward.HP is one of the two publicly-traded entities formed after the November 2015 split of Hewlett-Packard Company. Besides HP, the split led to the formation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report). HP primarily focuses on PCs, and printing products and services.Notably, over the past several years, the company’s printing business has been facing challenges like sluggish demand and cut-throat competition in the space, which have eroded its revenues and market share.It should be noted that demand for printers is not as strong as it was 10 years ago. It has witnessed a secular decline over the past several years, as consumers are increasingly favoring digital alternatives over printed materials due to the former’s cost effectiveness.Furthermore, over the past few quarters, HP has been losing market share to its Japanese rivals — Canon and Epson — due to intense price competition. These Japanese manufacturers have been able to slash prices due to a weak yen compared to the U.S. dollar.Thus, we believe the acquisition of Samsung’s printing operations could help HP turn around the printer business. The transaction will not only eliminate a major competitor but also help control prices. Apart from this, the acquisition will also give HP access to Samsung’s partners and strengthen the former’s position across various geographies.Currently, HP carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The long-term expected EPS growth rates for NVIDIA and Micron are 10.3% and 10%, respectively.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2899,HPQ,"NCR Corporation (NCR  -  Free Report) recently unveiled a mobile point-of-sale (POS) solution, Ring Up,to make payments and sale process easier for millions of U.S. micro businesses.NCR Silver’s Ring Up provides micro merchants with a complete cloud-based POS system powered by  Worldpay. Operating in over 40 countries, WorldPay a provider of merchant accounts offers payment gateways for all sizes of companies, fraud management, alternative payment methods and foreign exchange.The software is compatible with Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) iOS and Android mobile devices. Ring Up will make staff more mobile, simplify credit card payments and save floor space. This new system is also expected to improve the speed of service and enhance efficiency to a considerable extent.Ring Up’s mobile payment platform accepts payments through mobile devices by easily swiping the card and allows customers to accrue/redeem their rewards with a single tap or scan. Moreover, the company’s application aidsbusinesses to better understand their customers and accordingly design marketing campaign, consequentlyproviding a boost to customer satisfaction and driving revenues.The launch of Ring Up would help NCR capitalize on itsentry into the fast growing micro merchant category. More people are now opting for this mode of payment as it does not require any middle men, transaction fee or the need to disclose identity to complete the transaction.The demand for NCR’s POS solution is increasing among retailers and restaurant owners as it facilitates the automation of bill payment and accounting. As a result, managers get ample time for customer interaction, leading to increased productivity.We believe that using this technology, micro merchants can improve customer satisfaction to a considerable extent.Scope in POS MarketAccording to Global Market Insights, the global market size for POS terminals will reach $103.52 billion by 2023. The report also statesthat POS terminals market size, which at the end of 2015 was 32 million units, will reach 126 million units by 2023, reflecting a CAGR of 18.3% through the period.Another research firm stated that the global POS terminal market, valued at $42.14 billion in 2015, is anticipatedto reach $113.27 billion by 2024. Consequently, NCR with its varied offerings of POS terminals and solutions should be able to capitalize on these growth opportunities.Last WordsThe stock has outperformed the industry in the past one year. NCR’s shares have returned 18.1%, compared with the industry’s decline of 12.2%.NCR’s growing exposure in the ATM and self-service kiosk space is encouraging, given the tremendous prospects in the respective markets. Continuous product launches, growing popularity of its self-service offerings and synergies from acquisitions are the catalysts. Continuous deal wins also drive growth.Nonetheless, softness in the ATM business in mature markets, competition from Diebold Inc. (DBD  -  Free Report) and HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report),and a high debt burden remain concerns.Currently, NCR caries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank(Strong Buy) stocks here.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

2900,HPQ,"HP Inc.’s (HPQ  -  Free Report) latest quarterly results reflect solid execution in its printing business.The company’s printing business’ quarterly revenues have witnessed back-to-back year-over-year growth. During third-quarter fiscal 2017, Printing revenues were up 6% year over year to $4.698 billion, primarily due to a 10% increase in supplies revenues.Moreover, the company recorded increase in unit shipments in all the three quarters of fiscal 2017. During the first, second and third quarters, HP registered year-over-year growth of 6%, 3.6% and 1.3%, respectively, in unit shipments.Additionally, per reports of the independent research firm, International Data Corporation (“IDC”), HP has been witnessing market-share improvement in Hardcopy Peripherals for the last three consecutive quarters. This indicates that the company’s strategies are in the right direction.Challenges in HP’s Printing BusinessHP is one of the two publicly-traded entities formed after the November 2015 split of Hewlett-Packard Company. Besides HP Inc., the split led to the formation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report). HP primarily focuses on PCs and printing products and services.Notably, over the past several years, the company’s printing business has been facing challenges like sluggish demand and cut-throat competition in the space which have eroded its revenues and market share.It should be noted that demand for printers is not as strong as it was 10 years ago. It has witnessed a secular decline over the past several years, as consumers are increasingly favoring digital alternatives over printed materials due to their cost effectiveness.Furthermore, over the past few quarters, HP has been losing market share to its Japanese rivals — Canon and Epson — due to intense price competition. These Japanese manufacturers have been able to slash prices due to a weak yen compared to the U.S. dollar.HP’s Counter StrategiesIn an effort to revamp its printer business, HP is looking at every aspect of growth, including product innovation and differentiation, acquisition, and expansion of 3D printing capabilities.Innovation is the KeyIt should be noted that if demand for anything does not remain as strong as it did once, one should resort to creative ideas in order to make innovative and differentiated products for gaining greater market share from rivals.It seems that HP has learned this lesson and is focusing on developing innovative and differentiated products. Last year, the company rolled out a smart pocket-sized printer for smartphones and tablets called Sprocket.Furthermore, the company, last year, unveiled its A3 multifunction printers (MFPs), which are now being shipped to more than 80 countries covering all key markets. These printers are designed to hamper the traditional $55-billion A3 copier category. The all-new A3 MFPs — with latest printing technology — enhance overall customer and partner experience with advanced security features. The printers also provide brighter colors, shorter production cycles and higher production throughput.Trying Inorganic Growth TacticApart from focusing on developing differentiated products, HP is also looking at acquisitions to drive growth. Most recently, the company completed the acquisition of Samsung Electronics’ printer business.Apart from bringing in additional revenues, the acquisition will help HP in expanding its printing business, as Samsung's printer business has more than 6,500 printing patents. All these will support development and manufacturing of HP printers, going forward.Besides eliminating a major competitor, the above discussed deal will also facilitate price control. Also, it will give HP access to Samsung’s partners and strengthen the former’s position across various geographies.Enhancing 3D Printing CapabilitiesThe company is also trying to enhance its 3D printing business capabilities, in an effort to revive tumbling sales. It should be noted that even though HP has been operating in this space for almost five years now, the company is way behind 3D Systems Corporation (DDD  -  Free Report) and Stratasys Ltd. (SSYS  -  Free Report).Thus, in order to fortify its presence in this space, last year, HP unveiled its Jet Fusion 3D Printing Solution with two models to choose from — 4200 and 3200. Unlike 3D Systems and Stratasys, which target all kinds of consumers, HP emphasizes only on industrial markets due to the ability to afford a premium range of 3D printing solutions.To satisfy customers in this space, HP has collaborated with various companies like Siemens, BMW, Nike Inc. and Autodesk Inc., with an aim to develop more advanced 3D printing technologies for a wide array of industrial use.Bottom LineHP’s efforts to revive its printing business have been commendable. Looking at satisfactory results from HP’s strategies, we feel the company can turnaround the printing business, and have a bigger share in the inkjet as well as 3D printer market.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

2901,HPQ,"3D printer manufacturer Voxeljet AG (VJET  -  Free Report) is set to roll out a new 3D printing system which runs on the new High Speed Sintering (“HSS”) technology this November. The HSS technology is a major step in the metamorphosis of 3D printing from prototyping to large-scale production technology.Not long ago, plastic 3D printed parts were limited to just prototypes. However, with HP Inc.’s (HPQ  -  Free Report) Multi Jet Fusion technology, Carbon’s CLIP process and now Voxeljet’s High Speed Sintering, polymer-based 3D printing is evolving as a way to produce engineering-grade, end-use parts.Consequently, an increasing number of companies are focusing the resources on production instead of prototyping technologies.The new HSS process is akin to binder jetting — Voxeljet’s primary technology. The HSS technology involves an infrared absorbing ink, that is selectively jetted onto layers of plastic powder, which are then exposed to infrared light. The powder melts under the light and forms functional plastic parts with qualities similar to those produced via Selective Laser Sintering, Multi Jet Fusion, or injection molding.HSS has the potential to streamline supply chains and move production closer to markets, as it is typically 10 to 100 faster than present industrial 3D printing processes, as well as has the potential to produce up to 100,000 parts a day.HSS will enable Voxeljet to enter the thermoplastics market and directly manufacture end-use products. In fact, HSS’s potential scalability makes it “even more productive compared to other additive manufacturing processes,” according to Voxeljet.3D printing can now compete with high volume injection molding on price and speed, without the related design limitations, upfront tooling, stock and shipping costs.Other players in this dynamic industry have also dominated headlines in recent times. Just last week, computer and printing major HP announced the integration of its Multi Jet Fusion 3D printer with Siemens' Additive Manufacturing software module. Siemens' new software module will enable customers to integrate design, optimisation, simulation, preparation of print jobs and inspection processes for HP Multi Jet Fusion 3D printed parts. This initiative will help improve overall design-to-finished-part workflow efficiency and accelerate 3D printing for industrial production.In March this year, another major player — 3D Systems Corporation (DDD  -  Free Report) — announced the shipping of its first speedy 3D-printing production platform, Figure 4. In addition, the company unveiled a Figure 4 platform based on the Figure 4 technology and NextDent material, which has been designed for dental applications.The Figure 4 platform is designed to revolutionize the use of 3D printing, right from prototyping to large-scale production.On paper, 3D Systems' new technology looks similar to Carbon's ultra-fast proprietary CLIP technology. Stratasys, Ltd. (SSYS  -  Free Report) also has a proprietary photopolymerization technology, PolyJet, but does not offer a speedy version of the same.Amid heightened industry awareness and rapidly innovating technologies, 3D printing demand has been shooting up and will likely boost the profitability of 3D printing companies going forward.In fact, there are numerous industry experts who anticipate rapid growth for the industry in the years to come. According to Wohlers Associates, a consultancy firm, the global products and services market for 3D printing surged 35.2% to $4.1 billion from 2013 to 2014.According to a new market research report, the 3D printing market is anticipated to reach to $30.19 billion by 2022, growing at a CAGR of 28.5% between 2016 and 2022. As we discussed, companies have been accelerating the development of new technologies that would help expand market share in the manufacturing industry, by making the process radically faster and boosting the quality of production.Among end users, the aerospace industry has been leading the way in adopting additive manufacturing, with players like Boeing, Rolls-Royce, Airbus and General Electric already employing the technology to make end products.Investors seem optimistic of the above developments and the future prospects of the 3D printing industry. This has reflected in the share prices of most of the leading industry players. Stratasys, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has appreciated 21.5% in the past six months. HP and Voxeljet, both carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), have gone up 11.4% and 49.1%, respectively. However, we have a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) on 3D Systems, which declined 8.7% during the same time frame.Among other players in the industry, Materialise NV (MTLS  -  Free Report), with a Zacks Rank #2, has soared 63.6%, while The ExOne Company (XONE  -  Free Report), carrying a Zacks Rank #3, has declined 8.2% in the past six months.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

Moreover, the HP Elite Displays and HP Wireless Collaboration Keyboard have the base price starting from $164 and $89, respectively. Both of them are now available in the market.Few FactsAccording to the source, 54% of the total work is being done outside the office premises and total home working hours are expected to surge by 150% in the coming two years. This growth is mainly driven the increasing number of millennial workforce, with around 59% of millennials not being satisfied with the present work scenario.The increased usage of technology led to increase in security concerns such as endpoint attacks, which has more than doubled over the last six years. Keeping this in mind HP’s latest solutions are specially designed to offer better productivity, stimulation, and change the way people work and live.Last WordsHP’s shares have underperformed the industry to which it belongs to in the year-to-date period. While the stock has returned 31.3%, the industry gained 38.4%.However, HP’s efforts to turn around its business have been commendable. The company is working on product innovation, differentiation and enhancing the capabilities of printing business to stabilize the top line.The recently released PC shipment data by IDC depicts that HP’s restructuring initiatives, such as focus on product innovations, pricing, marketing and sales activities, divestment of non-core assets as well as cutting jobs to lower costs, are paying off. Per the data compiled by IDC, HP, witnessed year-over-year shipment growth for the fifth quarter in a row, after registering decline for five consecutive quarters.With the start of shipping A3 multifunction printers to more than 80 countries, which covers all key markets, HP can revive its printing business and grab a bigger share in the inkjet printer market. Further, the acquisition of Samsung’s printing business is anticipated to support the development and manufacturing of printers.However, macroeconomic challenges and tepid IT spending remain near-term concerns.

2903,HPQ,"Q2 earnings season is finally wrapping up, and for the most part, results have been strong across the board. In fact, we’ve seen broad-based growth reaching the double digit level for the second quarter in a row, an abundance of earnings surprises, and favorable trends on the revisions front.At this point, well over 90% of the S&P 500 members have reported their latest results, but there are still several marquee reports to anticipate. Indeed, the upcoming week will include a handful of market favorites and bellwether brands, meaning that investors will need to be paying attention.With that said, investors can always use the Zacks Earnings Calendar to plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases.

Using the Earnings Calendar, we looked ahead to next week—one of the last busy weeks of the earnings season—and selected the biggest reports to watch. Make sure to keep an eye on these companies as they prepare to report during the week of August 21:·         Salesforce.com (CRM  -  Free Report)) – August 22 – After Market CloseSalesforce, a cloud computing giant and global leader in customer relations solutions, is set to report its second-quarter fiscal 2018 results after the closing bell on August 22. While currency fluctuations and stepped-up investments might prove to be challenges, Salesforce remains a dominant industry force with diverse cloud offerings and strong client satisfaction.Heading into its report, Salesforce currently sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). With an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, surprise prediction is difficult; however, the stock does sport an “A” grade for growth, and investors should be pleased with the company’s year-over-year comparisons this quarter. According to our current consensus estimates, Salesforce is expected to report EPS growth of 18.3% and sales growth of 23.5% for its latest fiscal period. ·         HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report)) – August 23 – After Market CloseA result of the 2015 split of Hewlett-Packard Company into two publicly traded entities, HP Inc. is focused on the brand’s PC and printing products and services.

While the glory days of the PC are long gone, HP’s restructuring initiatives are finally starting to pay off, and its stock has been steadily rising all year.As we approach HP’s report date, the stock is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). While its Earnings ESP is at 0.00%, the company does have an “A” grade for Value, which is a bit of a rarity in today’s tech world.

2904,HPQ,"HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 23. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 2.6%. Notably, the stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice and came in line once, over the trailing four quarters. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 3%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderThe split from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) in November 2015 enabled HP to make customized approach for its businesses which was not possible when it operated as a single entity. The company is working on product innovation and differentiation, as well as enhancing the capabilities of the printing business to stabilize its top line.Over the past one year, the company rolled out various models under its PC product lines of EliteBook, Spectre and Pavilion Wave. Apart from this, it is focusing on its pricing actions and marketing and sales activities which have helped in stimulating demand for the company’s PC products in the market.The impact of these initiatives is well indicated by the fact that the company has gained its top position once again by replacing Lenovo, per Gartner’s recently released data on PC shipment for second-quarter 2017. Also, the last-quarter growth in the company’s PC shipments was its fifth quarter of consecutive year-over-year improvement, after several quarters of decline.HP’s efforts to turn around the business have been commendable and seem to be in the right direction as indicated by the results of the last few quarters. We believe that the benefit of the aforementioned initiatives will have a positive impact on the to-be-reported quarterly results also.However, macroeconomic challenges and tepid IT spending remain concerns. Competition from the likes of Dell, Lenovo and Apple also add to its woes.HP Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  HP Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | HP Inc.

2905,HPQ,"In a sudden move, Vishal Sikka stepped down as the chief executive officer and managing director of Infosys Limited (INFY  -  Free Report) earlier today, citing conflicts that deteriorated into mudslinging under an anonymous name. The move led to deep unrest among investors, causing shares to plunge 10.8% at one point in pre-market trading.The surprise move came amid intensifying animosity between the board and the co-founders, led by NR Narayana Murthy. It seems that a seven-month-long confrontation between the company’s founders on one hand, and Sikka and the board on the other, culminated into this drastic move. This is the second time that Infosys has plunged into a leadership crisis, after the founding members retired from the top management.Sikka had taken over the reins of India’s second largest software and outsourcing company in June 2014.Differences in New & Old LeadershipSikka cited a relentless stream of distractions and disruptions over the recent quarters, which were becoming increasingly personal and negative, as of late, as one of the leading reason for his step. He asserted that the “very public noise around us” had created a shaky atmosphere, making it difficult for management to function effectively.Differences had been simmering between Murthy and Sikka for quite some time now, with the former repeatedly disparaging Sikka's policies.Infosys Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Infosys Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Infosys Limited QuoteIn recent months, Infosys’ founders, including Murthy, have criticized the company's leadership, focusing on executive pay packages and alleged lapses in corporate governance. Other issues which the founders took offense to, included allegations of impropriety in the 2015 acquisitions of Panaya and Skava Systems.In an email last week, Murthy reportedly addressed some of his advisers that he had been told by at least three independent directors of Infosys that Sikka was less CEO material and more CTO (chief technology officer) material. He also reportedly condemned the Infosys board for not upholding governance standards.Further, Infosys founders (who still own 12.75% of the company) had questioned Sikka’s recent pay raise and the size of severance payouts given to some other executives, including former finance head — Rajiv Bansal.Infosys expressed profound distress by the unfounded personal attacks on the members of the management team, through anonymous letters that surfaced in recent months.Sikka’s TermWhen Sikka took over the helm, Infosys was lagging behind industry growth. Under his leadership, Infosys revenues jumped from $2.13 billion in first-quarter 2015 to $2.65 billion in first-quarter 2017, with strong margin performance and sustained cash generation. Sikka's focus on profitable growth delivered an increase in liquid assets (including cash and cash equivalents) from $4.9 billion in June 2014 to $6.1 billion in June 2017.Infosys also rolled out over 25 new services under Sikka, which helped bolster revenues significantly.However, the company's growth has slowed down sharply, after having soared in Sikka’s first two years. Consequently, Infosys’ share price has also underperformed the industry in recent times. Infosys’ shares have inched up 0.2% in the past year, grossly underperforming the industry’s average gain of 27.1%.Moving ForwardThe Indian IT bellwether has named U B Pravin Rao as interim chief executive officer and managing director, while Sikka will continue as executive vice-chairman. Rao was the chief operating officer of the company, with overall strategic and operational responsibility for the entire portfolio of Infosys’ offerings.In his new role, Sikka will continue to focus on strategic initiatives, key customer relationships and technology development. He will receive an annual salary of $1 during his tenure and will report to the company’s board.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderInfosys presently carries a Zacks rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader space include CSRA Inc. , CoStar Group, Inc. (CSGP  -  Free Report) and HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.CSRA has a solid earnings surprise history for the trailing four quarters, having beaten estimates each time for an average beat of 10.4%.CoStar Group also has a robust earnings surprise history, with an average beat of 27.6% over the trailing four quarters, beating estimates throughout.HP generated an average positive surprise of 3% over the trailing four quarters, surpassing estimates thrice.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye on Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

2906,HPQ,"Vipshop Holdings Limited (VIPS  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 16, after the closing bell. This online discount retailer’s earnings have missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two out of the trailing four-quarters. This translates to an average negative surprise of 0.41%.Let’s delve deeper on how things are shaping up for this announcement.Which Way are Estimates Treading?A look into estimate revisions give us an idea of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter as well as for fiscal 2017 has declined by a penny to 14 cents and 66 cents respectively, over the past 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2.49 billion for the said quarter and $10.4 billion for 2017.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil? Our proven model does not show that Vipshop is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Vipshop has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 14 cents. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, its ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Vipshop Holdings Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Vipshop Holdings Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Vipshop Holdings Limited QuoteFactors Influencing the Quarter Vipshop has been struggling with higher promotional activity, primarily in its retail outlets and higher mix of lower-margin products. These have been negatively impacting the company’s margins. Additionally, macroeconomic slowdown in China and increasing competition in the retail space remain as concerns. The headwinds are also well reflected in the share price performance of the company. Shares of Vipshop went down 7.7% over the past six months while the broader Computer and Technology sector gained 10.5%.Despite a difficult macroeconomic environment, Vipshop has been delivering improved top-line results in the past few quarters. This was primarily driven by the addition of new customers. The company has also been witnessing the addition of younger and more Internet- and mobile-savvy shoppers to its customer base. Vipshop plans to target these expanding demographics, in addition to offering products tailored for shoppers in various age groups. The company will also focus on delivering more personalized products and services to customers. We remain hopeful that such efforts would aid Vipshop’s performance in the forthcoming periods and facilitate overcoming industry related challenges.Do Computer and Technology Stocks Interest You?

The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to expenses related to Automic and Veracode acquisitions.CA’s non-GAAP net income from continuing operations was approximately $256 million as compared with $269 million reported in the year-ago quarter.CA exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2.771 billion compared with $2.971 billion in the previous quarter.

According to the company, “At June 30, 2017 exchange rates, this translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.42 to $2.48.” The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 is pegged at $2.19 per share.The company now expects non-GAAP operating margin to be in the range of 36–37%, (previous guidance 36%).

Considering the exchange rates as of Jun 30, 2017, this translates to the range of $1.09–$1.14 billion.Our TakeCA reported stellar first-quarter results and provided an encouraging fiscal 2018 guidance.We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model.CA has also adopted a “go to market” sales strategy. This brings together all the commercial functions including sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight. The integration of the marketing functions helps to lower costs, thereby improving the bottom line.Apart from pursuing growth through acquisitions, the company is leveraging cloud computing to enable organizations to source the best components – internal, external, private cloud, public cloud, mobile and more – to construct the most competitive business applications without wasting much time and resource.The company is also focused on providing advanced management and security software required by organizations to take complete advantage of this evolution.Meanwhile, increasing competition from Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report) and HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) along with exposure to Europe remain the near-term headwinds.CA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2908,HPQ,"NCR Corporation (NCR  -  Free Report) reported mixed results for the second quarter of 2017. The company’s non-GAAP earnings (excluding restructuring, acquisition-related expensesand other one-time items) from continuing operations of 80 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 75 cents and surged 11.1% year over year.Quarterly earnings also came ahead of the company’s guided range of 72–77 cents. The robust bottom-line performance was primarily driven efficient cost management and a lower share count.Notably, the stock outperformed the industry over the last one year. NCR’s shares have returned 37.2% compared with the industry’s decline of 8.2%.Quarter in DetailThe company’s revenues of $1.593 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.612 billion and decreased 1.7% on a year-over-year basis. On a constant currency basis (i.e. excluding FX impact and IPS business divesture), revenues were up 3% year over year.The company’s product revenues came in at $618 million, down 8.6% from the year-ago-quarter. However, service revenues increased 3.3% year over year and came in at $975 million.During second-quarter 2016, NCR modified its reportable segments to reflect changes in its reporting structure. The new reportable segments are Software, Services and Hardware segments.The company’s Software revenues on a reported basis were up 3% to $464 million. The increase was primarily due to a 9% and 5% increase in Cloud and Professional Services revenues, respectively. Nonetheless, Software license was down 6%. Software maintenance revenues were flat year over year.Services revenues increased 2% to $588 million on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis Services revenues increased 4%. The increase was primarily due to hardware maintenance growth.Hardware revenues however decreased 9% year over year on a reported basis to $541 million. The segment’s, revenues from ATM and IPS declined 21% and 91%, respectively, while that from SCO and POS surged 37% and 18%, respectively. The increase in SCO and POS revenues was primarily due to store transformation growth during the quarter. On a constant currency basis, Hardware revenues increased 1%.Non-GAAP gross profit for the quarter increased 3% and came in at $479 million, primarily due to strong execution as a result of strategic focus on business transformation, a positive revenue mix, efficiency and scale gains. Also, the non-GAAP gross margin was 30.1%, up from 28.7% reported in the year-ago quarter.Income from operations on a non-GAAP basis was $215 million, up from $207 million a year ago. Also, operating margin expanded 70 bps on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to strong execution as well as better productivity.Non-GAAP operating expenses during the quarter came in at $264 million, reflecting an increase from $258 million in the year-ago quarter.Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations was $122 million compared with $111 million in the year-ago quarter.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowThe ATM and POS manufacturer exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $377 million, down from $401 million in the previous quarter. Receivables were $1.32 billion compared with $1.29 billion in the previous quarter.However, NCR has a highly-leveraged balance sheet. The company ended the quarter with $3 billion of long-term debt in its book.In the second quarter, the company generated operating cash flow of $95 million and free cash flow was $18 million.Rhe company did not repurchase any share in the quarter under review. However, during the six months ended Jun 30, 2017, the company repurchased $350 million of its common stock.GuidanceNCR reiterated its revenue and earnings outlook for 2017. However, the third-quarter guidance was slightly disappointing.For the year, the company continues to anticipate revenues in the range of $6.63–$6.75 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 1% to 3% on a reported basis and 4% to 6% at adjusted constant currency. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $6.69 billion.Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected in the range of $3.32–$3.42. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is $3.37.The company continues to expect operating cash flow in the range of $805 million to $830 million and free cash flow between $500 million and $525 million.Coming to the third-quarter outlook, NCR expects revenues in the range of $1.66–$1.70 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $1.73 billion.The company expects non-GAAP earnings per share for the third quarter in the range of 88–93 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 93 cents.Our TakeNCR reported mixed second-quarter 2017 results wherein the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the top line missed the same. Also, the company third-quarter and FY17 guidance are disappointing.The company remains the largest supplier of ATM machines in Asia-Pacific and North America, while maintaining its leadership in the Asian and European markets. Per the latest report by global research company RBR Research, the global ATM installed base is expected to reach 4 million units by 2020 from 3 million units in 2014. Currently, India is the world’s fourth-largest ATM market with China, the U.S. and Japan holding the first three spots, respectively. This creates huge opportunities for companies like NCR.We believe that the company’s commitment to protect the trust and integrity of the ATM channel has been inspiring banks and a host of other financial institutions to opt for its services. Continued product launches, growing popularity of its self-service offerings and synergies from acquisitions are the other growth drivers. Continuous deal wins also drive growth.However, softness in the ATM business in mature markets, competition from Diebold Inc. (DBD  -  Free Report) and HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report), and a high debt burden remain concerns.Currently, NCR carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the technology sector is Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. (AAOI  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

2909,HPQ,"The top news stories from last week are Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) Messenger Ads entering beta, Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) offering broadband in rural America, HP (HPQ  -  Free Report) regaining the top spot in PCs and tech companies getting together on net neutrality.Facebook Messenger Ads BetaAfter testing Messenger ads in Thailand and Australia, Facebook is now taking the experience to a broader audience and a larger number of advertisers. So more users are beginning to see ads on the Messenger Home Tab. Clicking on them takes the user either to a Messenger conversation or a web page, whatever the advertiser chooses. Facebook won’t be snooping on conversations to help it target ads, which is good in terms of privacy but may not be as contextually relevant for users as they open the app purposefully, either to send or receive messages.Facebook has said that it now has 1.2 billion users on Messenger, so it makes sense to hunt up ways to monetize the user base. The initial idea of getting businesses and other organizations to create bots to converse with users resulted in the creation of 100,000 bots that take care of day to day concerns. With the ads also giving advertisers the option of pulling users to these bots or otherwise educating customers, Facebook is well on its way to building a communications platform for one-on-one interactions between businesses and users.Microsoft to Offer Rural BroadbandMicrosoft is looking to advance rural connectivity in the U.S. by using TV white spaces, or the unlicensed buffer channels that broadcasters avoid so signals from different channels don’t interrupt each other. Since Microsoft is planning on acquiring the spectrum for free, broadcasters aren’t too thrilled about the idea. Microsoft is banking on regulatory support to free up at least three channels nationwide without which its technology partners may not be willing to invest.The company will initially put in $10 billion plus any profit it makes directly from the venture to get high speed Internet to around 2 million people in rural areas by 2022. The government may be expected to agree to the plan, first, because there are still 23 million people without consistent connectivity in rural U.S. and second, because Microsoft has already tested the technology in Africa and India.Improved connectivity is a positive for all technology companies that offer services via the Internet and Microsoft is no different given its cloud first strategy. So there will of course be indirect benefits for the company.Facebook, Google, Netflix Want Net NeutralityIt’s telecoms versus Internet companies again as Ajit Pai, the Trump-appointed new chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has expressed his willingness to reverse some of the net neutrality rules (subjecting ISPs to utility-style regulations under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934) implemented by the Obama administration in 2015.Last week, a large number of tech companies along with a few hundred smaller websites joined together in a protest to stop the FCC. Americans have sent over eight million comments to the FCC that Ajit Pai and company will have to consider before coming to a decision.At the heart of the problem is the cost of maintaining and upgrading the network that some companies like Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Twitter, Facebook, Google’s YouTube, etc. use much more than others. Telecoms would like them to share the cost of network innovation since they are the biggest users. But if such fast lanes are created for these players, it can penalize the smaller guys that aren’t in a position to pay. Moreover, customers’ experience of the Internet could be weighted in favor of those paying more.Telecoms have now expanded their argument, bringing in autonomous cars, remote surgery and a growing variety of other highly latency-sensitive applications, saying that an outright ban on differential rates would mean an inability to charge these companies thus preventing them from supporting these technologies altogether.Moreover, the problem of paid fast lanes, being anti-competitive could probably be taken care of under existing law. Telecoms have also suggested that the regulating authority could be the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) instead of the FCC, which could quickly punish the wrong doers if required. But Internet companies fear that the FTC is not as experienced in these matters.  HP Regains PC Market ThroneHP maintained its position as the leading PC vendor for the second straight quarter, according to recent numbers from IDC. HP was also the vendor with the maximum growth (6.2%), which along with Dell (third largest), which grew shipments 3.7% and Apple (fifth), which grew 1.7%, offset the decline seen by other top vendors. These included number two Lenovo, which dropped 5.7% and ASUS, which dropped 8.6%. Others were down 12.2%, resulting in a total decline for the market of 3.3%.Both HP and Dell grew across regions, but Lenovo saw weakness in North America. Chromebooks did very well in North America. Asia was impacted by sales tax reform in India and delays in implementation of a public sector electronics tender in one of its southern states; high inventory and soft demand in China; conditions in Japan improved and the move from desktop to notebooks continued.Gartner, which excludes Chromebooks and iPads while including Surface in its calculations, had a slightly more pessimistic view on the market. While also agreeing with HP’s leading position (for the first time in years), the research firm estimates it grew just 3.3%. Lenovo was in second position with a decline of 8.4%, Dell third with an increase of 1.4%, Apple down 0.4%, ASUS down 10.3% and Acer down 12.5%. Total shipments dropped 4.3%. ""Higher PC prices due to the impact of component shortages for DRAM, solid state drives (SSDs) and LCD panels had a pronounced negative impact on PC demand,"" according to principal analyst Mikako Kitagawa.Not all vendors passed on the cost increase to customers. Business PCs that are purchased under contract therefore resulted in weaker profits, while consumer sales were hit because of greater demand elasticity and the consumer’s ability to wait for a more favorable pricing environment. TickerPrice Change Last WeekPrice Change Last 6 MonthsAAPL+3.37%+25.19%FB+5.62%+28.07%GOOGL+3.83%+18.10%MSFT+4.78%+16.19%INTC+2.35%-5.26%CSCO+1.68%+4.11%AMZN+2.35%+25.71% Other storiesCorporateApple Data Centers in Denmark, China: In order to improve iCloud services and comply with new Chinese law that requires that cloud services be operated by Chinese companies, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) is building a data center in the southern province of Guizhou with data management firm Guizhou-Cloud Big Data Industry Co Ltd (GCBD).Part of a planned $1 billion investment into the province, Apple’s data center will also focus on renewable energy for operations. Chinese authorities say that the law was made to deal with the increased threat of cyber-attacks and terrorism, but some are concerned that its vagaries put proprietary data of American companies at risk. Apple says that “Apple has strong data privacy and security protections in place and no backdoors will be created into any of our systems.”Meanwhile, the company has decided to put in $921 million to build a second data center in Denmark, which is being favored because of its reliable network and abundant supply of both wind and biomass (Apple operates all its data centers with renewable energy). The data center will take care of Apple's online services (iTunes Store, App Store, iMessage, Maps and Siri for customers all over Europe).Jefferies Negative on Intel: Jeffries analyst Mark Lipacis issued a sell rating on Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) shares and took down his price target to $29, citing a “tectonic shift” in computing that will see Intel quickly losing its dominant position in processing technology. Intel’s lead came from making the most of Moore’s law (cramming more transistors into a single chip to make it a more powerful computer). But this strategy obviously has limitations.Moreover, with the advent of big data, artificial intelligence, neural networks and IoT, there is greater value in building chips capable of parallel processing such as the graphics chips that NVIDIA has focused on. So as we can see already, Intel is struggling with decelerating growth in its data center business while NVIDIA is growing triple digits.Jeffries thinks Intel was late to jump on the bandwagon, giving competitors like NVIDIA, Xilinx and AMD the chance to grow share in this emerging market. Intel is not sitting back, of course, but its leadership position will be hard to win back here.Suntrust, Needham Upgrade NVIDIA: Other than the positive mention from Jeffries, NVIDIA also saw an upgrade last week. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst William Stein expressed optimism about its earnings and revenue growth potential, particularly with reference to the artificial intelligence segment. He also said that growth opportunities in the datacenter, gaming and automotive end markets were under appreciated and praised the company’s innovative spirit: ""Nvidia has a strong culture of innovation and desire to drive general purpose graphics processing unit (GP-GPU) computing adoption,"" meaning beyond gaming.NVIDIA’s edge comes from its CUDA computing platform that was first released in 2006 because it is harder to copy than hardware.  Meanwhile, Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill reiterated a buy rating while raising his price target on the shares from $130 to $200 citing checks with Toyota that indicated aggressive deployment of NVIDIA self-driving technology that may be expected to generate significant revenue for the chipmaker.Toshiba Chip Unit Sale Update: Last Tuesday, Western Digital matched the highest bid for Toshiba's chip business. This was followed up by an announcement on Wednesday that it had obtained the desired temporary restraining order from a San Francisco court forcing Toshiba to give its workers access to shared databases.The plea for injunction preventing Toshiba from proceeding with a sale that didn’t have its approval was denied. Toshiba argued that one, an American court didn’t have jurisdiction; two, urgency claims of SanDisk (WDC) are contrived since the sale was unlikely to close before the end of 2018; three, an injunction could irreparably damage the bidding process; and four, WDC has limited rights in the JV that were effectively extending control to all of Toshiba’s business. Toshiba also said that if the court granted an injunction, Toshiba needed a $20 billion bond to cover related harm thus caused.However, considering the fact that SK Hynix, which had joined the bidding process as part of the government-backed Innovation Fund of Japan and U.S. private equity investors Bain Capital, is now looking for an equity stake in the JV, Toshiba has gone back to talks with other bidders including WDC and a group that includes Taiwan's Foxconn, Apple, Amazon, Softbank and others.Legal/RegulatoryGoogle, YouTube Sued: Google’s YouTube has run into some trouble in its haste to remove hate speech and anti-Semitism from its platform. As a result, James Sweet and Chuck Mere, the creators of a YouTube channel called Zombiegoboom that allows players guns, saws, axes and other weapons to slaughter attacking zombies. The creators claim a revenue decline of 90-95% and the loss of a prospective buyer of the business for $60,000. Moreover, YouTube ignored requests for a review of their situation. They are asking for unspecified damages and class action certification so all others impacted similarly can be part of the fight.Google Challenge to French Tax Bill Successful: The Paris administrative court ruled that Google Ireland Limited was not subject to corporate and value-added taxes for the period 2005-2010. The tax authorities, which had charged Google with $1.3 billion for recording sales through Ireland and thereby avoiding tax payments in France, will likely appeal the case as the Finance Ministry is considering an appeal.Amazon Gets Food Retail Approval in India: Amazon will be investing $500 million into India’s food retail business, in addition to its prior commitment to $5 billion now that the Indian government has approved its entry into the segment. Food products are currently sold through Amazon Pantry where it has partnerships with Cloudtail and others. Its Amazon Now app also delivers same day groceries through partnerships with Big Bazaar, Star Bazaar and Hypercity in select areas.New Products/TechnologyFacebook Testing Paid Subscriptions: Facebook is attempting to breathe new life into its Instant Articles feature that hasn’t been making a lot of money for publishers given its limitations on ad loads and there being no need to get on the publishers’ websites to read stories. So the company is now introducing a paywall feature that will allow publishers to charge for any story they wish to. The feature will be tested on a small batch of publishers by year-end, and if successful, will roll out more broadly in 2018.New Server Chips from Intel: Intel announced a new line of server chips called Xeon Scalable that Martin Reynolds of Gartner thinks is an improvement over its previous generation, offering better power efficiency, improvement on artificial intelligence workload and more advanced storage. The chip is expected to help it fight a resurgent AMD, which is expected to eke out a few points of market share on the strength of its recently-launched Epyc line.On stage, the Intel chips were endorsed by Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, which is a big deal because these companies don’t just buy chips for themselves, but also to power their cloud computing infrastructure. But the world’s leading chipmaker still seems to be lagging NVIDIA in training machines for artificial intelligence.New Servers from Cisco: Cisco has updated the server and software that form a part of its Unified Computing System (UCS). The UCS M5 servers (including two new blade servers and three new rack servers) are powered by the new Intel Xeon Scalable processors, which enables them to double the memory capacity while improving performance by up to 86%.Microsoft’s New AI App: Microsoft has unveiled a new AI-powered app called Seeing AI for iOS. As the name indicates, the app uses the camera along with an AI-powered vision recognition system to look at an object and describe relevant information about it to a visually impaired person.M&A and CollaborationsApple Gets Closer to PayPal: The partnership allows Apple iPhone, iPod, Apple TV and Apple Watch users to pay for things like App Store, Apple Music, and iTunes through PayPal. The agreement is a very big deal for Paypal since it opens the door to a huge market, more so since Apple’s customers use their devices a lot to make payments and Apple continues to expand its services creating even more opportunities.Moreover, if iMessage grows into a platform like Facebook Messenger, there could be even bigger opportunities for integration with Apple services. For Apple, it’s good to have more payment options as it strives to give customers all the options they could possibly need.Some NumbersiPhone Shipment Estimate Cut: Bank of America/Merrill Lynch analysts Wamsi Mohan and Stefano Pascale have said that based on their interactions with the supply chain on a recent trip to Asia, they were cutting iPhone shipment estimates for the September quarter by 11 million and December quarter by 6 million. The weakness was attributed to a 3-4 week delay in iPhone 8 shipments related to a supply glitch that Apple and its suppliers are ironing out.On the other hand, Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski said that despite the possible supply chain bottlenecks, the larger installed base (now estimated at 700 million, up from 300 million in 2014 when he iPhone 6 launched) was good news, particularly since a recent Goldman survey showed that the same percentage of customers were willing to upgrade as a year ago, despite the higher price of the iPhone 8. So, since supply chain issues are a near term concern, the higher priced phone could still be expected to generate greater profitability for Apple in fiscal 2018.Apple Losing Video Customers: A WSJ report says that Apple is losing its share of the digital movie renting and selling market. Mostly attributable to the stiff competition from companies like Netflix, Amazon and Comcast, Apple’s estimated share has dropped to 20-35% of the overall market, down from around 50% in 2012. Apple maintains that iTunes movie rental and sales revenues have increased (29% in 2015 and 21% in 2016), but since it hasn’t mentioned market share (nor has any third party for that matter), we have to assume that WSJ’s unnamed sources are good.Oculus Rift Price Cut: Facebook has announced the second price cut on its Oculus Rift headset and this time it’s down $200 to $400 for the next six weeks, closer in price to the sets Sony and Samsung are providing. VR has not lived up to the hype, mainly because there are a number of issues with the headsets, such as picture quality, discomfort in using a device for too long, price (most still require tethering to a high end PC) and a still low volume of VR content that might keep customers engaged.But companies are working on all these aspects and Facebook itself is getting ready to launch a cheap $200 device that won’t require tethering in partnership with Xiaomi (Xiaomi will manufacture the headsets that will be sold under the Xiaomi brand in China and Oculus brand everywhere else in the world), Bloomberg reports. The $200 device is coming later this year.India Is Facebook’s Biggest Market: According to data submitted by Facebook to advertisers, the company now has its largest number of active users in India numbering 241 million, topping U.S. users of 240 million for the first time. India active users were up 27% in the last 6 months, more than double the U.S. active user growth rate of 12%.More encouraging is the fact that India is relatively under-penetrated at 19% compared to the U.S., which is 73% penetrated and the global average penetration of 42%. Moreover, since just one Indian city (New Delhi) made it to the top 10, Facebook’s user base in the large and populous country seems more distributed.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?

2910,HPQ,"NCR Corporation (NCR  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has unveiled a new and easy Managed Services for Community Financial Institutions (CFIs) in the U.S. NCR’s management and maintenance services will include monitoring of the ATM network, managing the availability of cash, maintenance of software and lowering costs for CFIs.With mounting competition, leading financial institutions are continuously trying to increase customer interaction, cut costs, generate higher revenues and improve efficacy through their self-service channels. These goals can be realized by deploying NCR’s Managed Services solutions aimed at self-service kiosks.NCR’s service suites ensure customer satisfaction. Moreover, they are expected to boost the customer retention rate for CFIs and generate steady revenue streams for NCR.Chris King, VP of Financial Sales, North America, NCR, said, “The challenge that CFIs face is how to deliver world-class customer service at the lowest possible cost.” He added, “NCR’s new managed offers help CFIs stretch their available resources to provide the best possible experience with their ATM network.”The company has been a global leader in self-service ATMs for several years in terms of market share. The company has more than 20,000 employees across 180 countries, delivering services worldwide to financial, retail and hospitality customers.NCR’s Managed Services solutions will improve operational efficiency, curb expenses and expand their business. It will also ensure a superior self-service experience for the customers of CFIs.Share PriceThe stock has outperformed the Zacks categorized Computer-Integrated Systems industry in the last one year. NCR’s shares have returned 34.69% compared with the industry’s decline of 3.96%. Last WordsThe company remains the largest supplier of ATM machines in Asia-Pacific and North America, while maintaining its leadership in the Asian and European markets. Per the latest report by global research company RBR Research, the global ATM installed base is expected to reach 4 million units by 2020 from 3 million units in 2014. Currently, India is the world’s fourth-largest ATM market with China, the U.S. and Japan holding the first three spots, respectively. This creates huge opportunities for companies like NCR.We believe that the company’s commitment to protect the trust and integrity of the ATM channel has been inspiring banks and a host of other financial institutions to opt for its services.Continued product launches, growing popularity of its self-service offerings and synergies from acquisitions are other growth drivers.Softness in the ATM business in mature markets, competition from Diebold Inc. (DBD  -  Free Report) and HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) and a high debt burden remain concerns.Currently, NCR carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the technology sector is Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Applied Materials has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 16.6%.5 Trades Could Profit """"Big-League"""" from Trump Policies If the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

2911,HPQ,"A prudent investment decision means buying stocks that offer solid prospects and selling those that appear risky. Again, at times it is rational to hold on to certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions. Here, we take into account HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report), a company which has potential to perform well in the near term.HP Inc. is one of the two companies which came into existence post the split from the parent company – Hewlett-Packard Company – in Nov 2015. The stock has been clocking solid returns since then and gained approximately 33.2%, outperforming the Zacks categorized Computer-Mini industry’s return of 22.5% during the same time frame. The major part of the rally has been witnessed this year. In the year, so far, the stock has gained 24.1%.The other company which came into existence after the split is Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report).What’s Driving the Stock?Post the split, HP adopted a strategy of focusing on product innovation and differentiation, as well as enhancing the capabilities of its printing business, which will stabilize the top line.Over the past one year, the company launched various models under its PC product lines of EliteBook, Spectre and Pavilion Wave. Apart from this, it is focusing on its pricing actions and marketing and sales activities which have helped in stimulating demand for its PC products in the market.The impact of these initiatives is well indicated by the fact that the company has gained its top position once again by replacing Lenovo, per Gartner’s recently released data on PC shipment for second-quarter 2017. Also, the last-quarter growth in the company’s PC shipments was its fifth quarter of consecutive year-over-year improvement after several quarters of decline.The company’s efforts to revamp its printing business have also been commendable. It should be noted that HP signed a deal to acquire Samsung Electronics’ printer business in 2016, for $1.05 billion. The acquisition is a strategic fit for HP as it will expand the company’s printing business, with the addition of 6,500-plus printing patents owned by Samsung.In addition, the company is now focused on boosting its 3D printing business capabilities. However, unlike 3D Systems (DDD  -  Free Report) and Stratasys (SSYS  -  Free Report), which target all kinds of consumers, HP is emphasizing only on industrial markets because of their ability to afford a premium range of 3D printing solutions. It should be noted that even though HP has been operating in this space for almost five years now, it still lags behind 3D Systems and Stratasys.On the cost front too, HP has taken remarkable steps, which include the divestment of its content management software tools and Customer Communications Management (CCM) assets to Open Text Corporation and elimination of around 3,000–4,000 jobs.The company expects the divestment of CCM to reduce cost and enhance productivity. This, in turn, would help the company enhance its profitability. The job cuts are anticipated to generate annualized cost savings of approximately $200–$300 million from fiscal 2020.Bottom LineWe believe that HP’s massive restructuring moves will complement its focus on core businesses, as well as enable it to expand its share in the PC and Printing market. Furthermore, the two independent research firms – Gartner and International Data Corporation – hinted that the PC industry has been moving toward stabilization. Therefore, we believe stabilization in PC shipments will benefit the business prospects of companies like HP Inc.Furthermore, HP has a VGM Style Score of “A”. We note that our VGM score highlights the determining elements in a stock that can push the stock price higher. We can essentially filter out the negatives and focus on the positives which drive price.Therefore, in our opinion, the stock deserves a place in investor’s portfolio. Currently, HP carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation. See Them Free>>
"
2912,HPQ,"Despite the turmoil that is occurring within the credit markets, the outlook for third-quarter profits is rather positive. Brokerage analysts expect companies within the S&P 1500 (S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600) to post median growth of 8.5%. Although this would be a slower pace of growth than a year ago (Q306), it is still indicative of notable increases in corporate profits. If earnings come in above expectations, it is reasonable to expect the median company within the S&P 500 to report double-digit growth.
"
2913,HPQ,"There are a few reasons why profits are continuing to rise. Many companies have been able to leverage higher raw material costs into higher prices. Corporations are continuing to invest in software and equipment. The consumer, despite the rise in foreclosures, is continuing to spend. (Just yesterday, Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) said that demand for high definition TVs remains strong.) The weak dollar both makes exports more competitive and increases the value of profits earned abroad. Share repurchases are increasing the relative proportion of profits per share. And, most importantly, the economy is still expanding.
"
2914,HPQ,"At the industry level, there are relatively few surprises as to the type of company that is likely to report strong growth and the type that is likely to report weak growth.
"
2915,HPQ,"On the positive side, Aerospace appears set for another round of good reports. Air traffic has been on the rise worldwide, airlines are investing in their fleets and demand for parts remains healthy. Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) has been a beneficiary of these trends with a lengthy backlog for its new Dreamliner jet last years, even though the aircraft has yet to go on its inaugural flight. On the replacement parts side of the industry, Precision Castparts (PCP) is projected to generate a 60% increase when it reports this fall. BA and PCP are both Zacks #2 Rank (""buy"") stocks.
"
2916,HPQ,"Beverage makers appear likely to generate median double-digit growth. Demand for bottled water and flavored beverages are helping to offset the traditional dependence on soda. Price increases have also helped. Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG), which topped second-quarter expectations by seven cents, is expected to report am 11% rise in third-quarter earnings. PBG is a Zacks #2 Rank stock.
"
2917,HPQ,"Those food companies able to pass along higher commodity prices should also fare well. Corn Products International (CPO) reaffirmed its full-year guidance last month. Heinz (HNZ) raised its full-year guidance last month, citing good sales performance of its beans, soups, Smart Ones diet frozen meals and its Classico sauces. The company also realized a 13% increase in ketchup sales during its fiscal first-quarter. CPO is a Zacks #1 Rank (""strong buy"") stock and HNZ is a Zacks #2 Rank stock.
"
2918,HPQ,"Staying with the agriculture theme for a moment, Deere & Co (DE  -  Free Report) is projected to report 27% profit growth this quarter. Those who regularly read this column will know that the push for increased use of ethanol and worldwide economic growth has created a booming agricultural economy. Prices of several food-related commodities have recently hit new highs. DE is a Zacks #1 Rank stock.
"
2919,HPQ,"Tech giants Hewlett-Packard (HPQ  -  Free Report) and Cisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report) both pleasantly surprised their shareholders last quarter and are expected to achieve another good quarter. Strong sales of laptop computers are providing a boost to HPQ. Brokerage analysts believe the company could deliver 19% growth this quarter. Higher corporate spending and ever-growing reliance on networks should enable CSCO to generate 18% growth this quarter. Two analysts have raised their fiscal first-quarter forecasts on the company within the past month. Both HPQ and CSCO are Zacks #2 Rank stocks.
"
2920,HPQ,"On the flip side, the median projected growth rate for regional banks within the S&P 1500 is 0.0%. As I discussed a couple of weeks ago, profit forecasts for many banks have been cut. Fewer mortgage originations, the ongoing credit crisis and more intense competition for deposits are all headwinds facing many financial institutions. Although yesterday's rate cut was welcome news, it is unlikely to reverse the current trends in the housing market. IndyMac (IMB), First Horizon National (FHN) and Susquehanna (SUSQ) are among those projected to post the largest drops in year-over-year earnings. IMB is a Zacks #3 Rank (""hold"") stock, SUSQ is a Zacks #4 Rank (""sell"") stocks and FHN is a Zacks #5 Rank (""strong sell"") stock.
"
2921,HPQ,"The third-quarter outlook for the mega banks is only slightly more positive. The median growth rate for Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Wachovia (WB) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) is just 4.7%. WB is a Zacks #4 Rank stock, the other banks are Zacks #3 Rank stocks.
"
2922,HPQ,"Eight homebuilders within the S&P 1500 have a Zacks Rank of 5. The median projected growth rate for these eight homebuilders is -138%. Despite yesterday's rally, the outlook for homebuilders is not positive.
"
2923,HPQ,"The problems with the housing market are well known, but what isn't discussed as much are the headwinds facing semiconductor companies. Although demand for electronics remains very healthy, chip prices are still under pressure. The lack of pricing power hurt chip companies in the second-quarter and is remaining an issue in the third quarter. This is why the median semiconductor company is expected to report no change in profits from a year ago. Three companies, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report), Adaptec (ADPT) and Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) are likely to report triple-digit percentage declines in earnings. These three chipmakers are Zacks #3 Rank stocks.

"
2926,HPQ,"During the past four weeks, there have been 153 full-year earnings estimates revised downward for companies classified in Retail-Apparel/Shoe. This equates to an average of about 3.4 estimates revised downward for each company in the group. To put these numbers in perspective, Retail-Shoe/Apparel contains just 1% of companies within the Zacks Rank universe but accounts for 2.5% of all downward revisions.
"
2927,HPQ,"There are eight Zacks #5 Rank (strong sell) and 17 Zacks #4 Rank (sell) stocks within this group; in other words, 55% of the clothing and shoe retailers have a Zacks Rank equivalent to sell or worse. The bearishness reflects disappointing July same-store sales for many retailers including Bakers Footwear Group (BKRS), Pacific Sunwear of California (PSUN) and The Talbots (TLB). The weakness in sales was not universal, however, though economic factors did have some impact. Merchandising mistakes cost some retailers sales as did a shifting of tax-free days to August in Florida and Texas and a later start to the new school year in some counties.
"
2928,HPQ,"All this said, investors should note that Target (TGT  -  Free Report) matched earnings expectations and Dicks Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report) and Saks (SKS) beat expectations yesterday, so the weakness is not universal. These recent reports also suggest that some retailers are using the economy as an excuse to cover up fashion and/or promotional mistakes.
"
2929,HPQ,"As many of you are aware, Hewlett-Packard (HPQ  -  Free Report) topped fiscal third-quarter expectations last week. The technology company generated non-GAAP earnings of 71 cents per share, six cents above expectations and up from 52 cents a year prior. Revenues rose 12%, after adjusting for currency translations, thanks in large part to a 54% increase in laptop computer sales. HPQ also sold more printers despite the entrance of Kodak (EK) into the inkjet printer market. 
"
2930,HPQ,"HPQ upped its fiscal 2007 guidance and now expects revenues of $103 to $103.2 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $2.86 to $2.87 per share. (Previously, the company had forecast revenues of $100.5 to $100.9 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $2.75 to $2.77 per share.) Nearly all of the covering brokerage analysts raised their forecasts for fiscal 2007 profits in response, sending the consensus estimate 11 cents higher to $2.88 per share. Forecasts for fiscal 2008 were also revised higher, moving the consensus estimate nine cents higher to $3.21 per share. HPQ is a Zacks #2 Rank (buy) stock and is classified in Computer-Mini.
"
2931,HPQ,"Strong sales of computers have helped to fuel demand for video cards, such as those made by NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report). Recently, NVDA reported fiscal second-quarter GAAP profits of 43 cents per share, nine cents ahead of expectations and up nearly double from a year prior. Revenues surged 36% to $935.3 million and gross margins reached a record 45.3%. NVDA saw 37% growth in desktop cards and 129% growth in laptop cards. The company was able to increase its market share, a notable feat since NVDA already is the leading manufacturer of video cards. Although there are some concerns about supply constraints, nearly all of the covering brokerage analysts have raised their profit projections for both fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009. The consensus earnings estimates call for per share profits to reach $1.70 this year (up from $1.50) and $1.98 next year (up from $1.79). NVDA is a Zacks #1 Rank (strong buy) stock and is classified in Computer-Graphics.
"
2932,HPQ,"Brokerage analysts have also recently raised profit forecasts on several other computer-related companies including Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Sierra Wireless (SWIR  -  Free Report) and Synaptics (SYNA  -  Free Report). The continuing shift towards mobile computing, the growth of digital communications, increased popularity of video-on-demand, Microsofts (MSFT  -  Free Report) Vista operating system and sustained investment by corporations in technology are all playing a positive role.

2962,HPQ,"*A small portion of the estimates reflect FY08 earnings estimates for companies whose fiscal years end at a month other than December 2007 or January 2008.
"
2963,HPQ,"During the past four weeks, there have been 153 full-year earnings estimates revised downward for companies classified in Retail-Apparel/Shoe. This equates to an average of about 3.4 estimates revised downward for each company in the group. To put these numbers in perspective, Retail-Shoe/Apparel contains just 1% of companies within the Zacks Rank universe but accounts for 2.5% of all downward revisions.
"
2964,HPQ,"There are eight Zacks #5 Rank (strong sell) and 17 Zacks #4 Rank (sell) stocks within this group; in other words, 55% of the clothing and shoe retailers have a Zacks Rank equivalent to sell or worse. The bearishness reflects disappointing July same-store sales for many retailers including Bakers Footwear Group (BKRS), Pacific Sunwear of California (PSUN) and The Talbots (TLB). The weakness in sales was not universal, however, though economic factors did have some impact. Merchandising mistakes cost some retailers sales as did a shifting of tax-free days to August in Florida and Texas and a later start to the new school year in some counties.
"
2965,HPQ,"All this said, investors should note that Target (TGT  -  Free Report) matched earnings expectations and Dicks Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report) and Saks (SKS) beat expectations yesterday, so the weakness is not universal. These recent reports also suggest that some retailers are using the economy as an excuse to cover up fashion and/or promotional mistakes.
"
2966,HPQ,"As many of you are aware, Hewlett-Packard (HPQ  -  Free Report) topped fiscal third-quarter expectations last week. The technology company generated non-GAAP earnings of 71 cents per share, six cents above expectations and up from 52 cents a year prior. Revenues rose 12%, after adjusting for currency translations, thanks in large part to a 54% increase in laptop computer sales. HPQ also sold more printers despite the entrance of Kodak (EK) into the inkjet printer market. 
"
2967,HPQ,"HPQ upped its fiscal 2007 guidance and now expects revenues of $103 to $103.2 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $2.86 to $2.87 per share. (Previously, the company had forecast revenues of $100.5 to $100.9 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $2.75 to $2.77 per share.) Nearly all of the covering brokerage analysts raised their forecasts for fiscal 2007 profits in response, sending the consensus estimate 11 cents higher to $2.88 per share. Forecasts for fiscal 2008 were also revised higher, moving the consensus estimate nine cents higher to $3.21 per share. HPQ is a Zacks #2 Rank (buy) stock and is classified in Computer-Mini.
"
2968,HPQ,"Strong sales of computers have helped to fuel demand for video cards, such as those made by NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report). Recently, NVDA reported fiscal second-quarter GAAP profits of 43 cents per share, nine cents ahead of expectations and up nearly double from a year prior. Revenues surged 36% to $935.3 million and gross margins reached a record 45.3%. NVDA saw 37% growth in desktop cards and 129% growth in laptop cards. The company was able to increase its market share, a notable feat since NVDA already is the leading manufacturer of video cards. Although there are some concerns about supply constraints, nearly all of the covering brokerage analysts have raised their profit projections for both fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009. The consensus earnings estimates call for per share profits to reach $1.70 this year (up from $1.50) and $1.98 next year (up from $1.79). NVDA is a Zacks #1 Rank (strong buy) stock and is classified in Computer-Graphics.
"
2969,HPQ,"Brokerage analysts have also recently raised profit forecasts on several other computer-related companies including Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Sierra Wireless (SWIR  -  Free Report) and Synaptics (SYNA  -  Free Report). The continuing shift towards mobile computing, the growth of digital communications, increased popularity of video-on-demand, Microsofts (MSFT  -  Free Report) Vista operating system and sustained investment by corporations in technology are all playing a positive role.

"
2999,HPQ,"*A small portion of the estimates reflect FY08 earnings estimates for companies whose fiscal years end at a month other than December 2007 or January 2008.
"
3000,HPQ,"The central banks have been moving to stave off a potential credit crunch by pumping money into the banking system. The action is being caused by a growing number of financial firms who are encountering liquidity problems. Central bankers seem be aware that many recessions have been caused by a sudden swing from hubris to a credit crunch as rationality reappears; the recent moves to put more liquidity into the system is clearly an attempt to prevent history from repeating itself.
"
3001,HPQ,"Although down materially on Thursday and continuing to decline as I write this on Friday morning, the U.S. markets remain in pretty strong shape. For the week, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are essentially flat with the Dow down slightly. Relative to 12 months ago, all three indexes are up by double-digit margins. Such returns are hardly a sign of fear being priced into stocks.
"
3002,HPQ,"August has historically been a tough month for stocks. The combination of earnings season ending and summer vacations leads to increased volatility and a lack of catalysts driving stock prices higher. Adding to the mix over the very near-term will be options expiration, which will occur next Friday, Aug 17.
"
3003,HPQ,"There will be earnings reports from 159 companies during the week of Aug 13  17. Retailers will play a prominent role with Macys (M  -  Free Report), Kohls (KSS  -  Free Report), Home Depot (HD) and Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) releasing quarterly results. Coincidently, the Census Bureau will release July retail sales data at the start of the week. Dow component Hewlett-Packard (HPQ  -  Free Report) will also report, on Thursday after the close of trading.
"
3004,HPQ,"Going back to the economic calendar, June business inventories will be published on Monday. Tuesday features July PPI and the June trade deficit. Consumer inflation data (CPI) will be released on Wednesday, along with July industrial production and capacity, the August New York Fed index and the August NAHB Housing Market Index. Thursday features July housing starts and the August Phili Fed index. The preliminary University of Michigan consumer confidence index will be issued on Friday.
"
3005,HPQ,"Will any of the earnings or economic data matter? Its hard to say. The markets got a lift from Cisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report) bullish report, but the gains were reversed by new credit worries. Probably, the best thing that can happen right now is a takeover of a large-cap company by a private equity firm, as this would reassure investors that the M&A market has not closed its doors. But given the current environment, this probably wont occur, so investors should keep some Dramamine by their side.
"
3006,HPQ,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises during the Week of Aug 13 - 17
"
3007,HPQ,"One brokerage analyst raised his second-quarter forecast on Deere & Co. (DE  -  Free Report) over the past seven days, following positive revisions by two other analysts within the past 30 days. Combined, these revisions have pushed the consensus estimate up two cents to $2 per share. The Most Recent Consensus is more bullish at $2.03 per share. DE has topped expectations during the past four quarters by an average margin of 21 cents per share. Deere & Co. is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Aug 15, before the start of trading.
"
3008,HPQ,"The TJX Companies (TJX  -  Free Report) just raised its second-quarter guidance. Citing an 8% rise in July sales and a 5% rise in same-store sales, the company predicted second-quarter earnings would be slightly above the high end of previous guidance for profits of 34 to 36 cents per share. Brokerage analysts have not yet adjusted their forecasts in response to the new guidance, though the consensus estimate of 36 cents per share is two cents higher than the average projection of a month ago. The TJX Companies is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Aug 14, before the start of trading.
"
3009,HPQ,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of Aug 13 - 17
"
3010,HPQ,"Last week, Network Appliance (NTAP  -  Free Report) cut its fiscal first-quarter guidance. The company said that revenues fell, on a sequential quarterly basis, to a range of $684 to $688 million and GAAP earnings would be between eight to nine cents per share. NTAP said the weak performance was caused by continued softness in enterprise storage spending. Nearly all of the covering brokerage analysts slashed their forecasts in response, causing the consensus estimate to plunge by seven cents to 10 cents per share. The networking equipment company beat estimates last quarter, but has missed twice during the past four quarters. Network Appliance is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Aug 15, after the close of trading.

3026,HPQ,"Premium technology company, Pitney Bowes Inc. (PBI  -  Free Report), recently declared the renewal and extension of its global strategic partnership with HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report). The two technology behemoths have delivered integrated print to mail solutions for high impact customer communications since 2009.The collaboration between these two companies has launched several industry-leading solutions, including the Pitney Bowes IntelliJet Printing Systems, which has driven revenues  and streamlined operations for users. This strategic partnership enables clients to deliver accurate, precise and personalized communications to their clients from a single solution provider by offering access to industry-leading technology.Recently, the company also announced that Renkim, a major player in the financial and mission-critical documents industry has bought two AcceleJet printing and finishing systems to streamline its print to mail workflow. The two new AcceleJet systems are going to replace seven legacy printers and are critical for the company’s redesigned floorplan and streamlined workflow.However, despite improving business trends and portfolio repositioning to drive growth, the shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have had a disappointing run on the bourse in the last six months. Its shares have declined 5.5%, against the industry’s gain of 3.3%.The fact remains that softness in the company’s North American mailing business has yet to subside completely. In the recently reported second-quarter 2017 results, the company’s Small and Medium Business Solutions revenues dipped 3% year over year to $436.4 million. Additionally, decline in recurring revenues and poor equipment sales proved to be a drag on the International Mailing Business. Uncertain global economic environment is anticipated to impact production mail and software businesses in the near term, consequently limiting growth momentum.Moreover, the company has been experiencing a surge in operating expenses due to ERP implementation in the United States and higher marketing expenses in relation to aggressive advertising and marketing strategies for strengthening brand value. The company anticipates marketing expense to be up on a year-over-year basis. Also, capital expenses associated with the ERP project remain a hindrance. Till the benefits of ERP materialize, the company expects to incur higher capital expenses that might exert pressure on margins.On the positive side, strong prospects of global e-commerce business, Shipping business and Digital Commerce Solutions are expected to be mitigate some of these headwinds for Pitney Bowes in the long haul.Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks from the same space are Axcelis Technologies, Inc.
