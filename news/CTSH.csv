Our preliminary analysis indicates that those with the higher adjusted tax rates (DXC, DST Systems and Conduent) stand to benefit the most from reform,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Essex said in a note to clients.Senate Republicans cleared the way for $1.5 trillion in tax cuts early Wednesday with a 51-48 vote. The bill is expected to soon reach President Trump's desk, after the House recasts its vote due to procedural issues.While financial firms such as banks stand to gain the most from the tax package, Wall Street analysts are scrambling to identify other sectors.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.""We believe Street numbers, including our own, will need to be adjusted upon passage of tax reform but do not anticipate a dramatic impact to stock prices,"" added Essex in the report.DXC Technology rose 0.5% to close at 95.38 on the stock market today.

30,CTSH,"As investors and Warren Buffett followers ponder what Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) will do with its swelling, record-high pile of cash, analysts say options include a major acquisition, buying more stocks like Apple (AAPL), doing nothing, or even a first-ever dividend.X The holding company held $109.3 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of the third quarter and will grow by some $3 billion more in December thanks to a bet on the burger business years ago. The record cash hoard is more than five times the $20 billion that CEO Buffett likes to keep on hand, and many shareholders want to see Berkshire put the money to greater work.Hopes are high that Berkshire could shake things up with a deal to rival its $37 billion Precision Castparts purchase in 2016 or its $26 billion Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad purchase in 2010, especially since an attempt this year to buy electric utility Oncor fizzled, while investments in a real estate investment trust and a Canadian mortgage lender hardly made a dent in Berkshire's cash.Buffett even acknowledged to Berkshire shareholders in May that it had been a while since he had pressed his ""foot to the floor"" on an acquisition, and rued keeping so much cash just lying around. But he said the question is: ""Are we going to be able to deploy it?""One challenge facing a Berkshire megadeal is stiff competition among U.S. companies looking to grow through acquisitions. Just in the last month, CVS Health (CVS) agreed to buy Aetna (AET) for $69 billion and Disney (DIS) reached a deal to buy most of 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) assets for $66 billion. The number of U.S. deals totaled 9,999 through Dec. 26, up 4.5% vs. all of 2016, according to Dealogic. And while deal values have slipped 14% to $1.492 trillion so far this year, they top the yearly average of approximately $1.137 trillion since 1995.Cathy Seifert, an equity analyst at investment research firm CFRA, thinks a key deal — or two — is likely. What she described as Berkshire's ""embarrassing"" Oncor loss may have left Buffett with the itch to prove his deal making chops, though she doesn't expect him to buy some hot tech company.""My sense is, valuation aside, there is still definitely an appetite to do deals,"" Seifert told Investor's Business Daily.A famously value-driven, opportunistic investor, Buffett's likely to scout for acquisition candidates in underperforming sectors as well as those that tend to do well late in the economic cycle. So think consumer staples, industrials, energy and telecom, Seifert said, adding that Buffett could also look abroad for acquisitions, especially Europe given the healthy recovery in many economies there.As for individual names that Berkshire could target, FactSet Research suggested Nike (NKE), Cognizant (CTSH), BlackRock (BLK), SAP (SAP) and Public Storage (PSA) among other companies. These companies check off Buffett's main acquisition criteria: sizable businesses, solid returns on equity, stable profits, low debt, able management, well-loved brands and simple business models.But any megadeal may be done with 3G Capital, which has teamed up with Buffett lately, including on the Kraft-Heinz (KHC) merger and the Burger King deal that eventually created Restaurant Brands (QSR).Actually, a splashy new deal is unlikely in the year ahead, said Robert Miles, the author of several books on Buffett. After a long bull market and stocks at record highs, a good deal is hard to find, and Buffett is ""a Walmart (WMT) shopper when it comes to stocks and companies"" — meaning, he looks long and hard at valuations.Miles said the 87-year-old Berkshire chief could bide his time ""until the next calamity in financial markets"" to jump on a megadeal.Meanwhile, the insurance segment remains Berkshire's cash cow and is its most important segment, notwithstanding this year's series of disasters that will force hefty payouts.The insurance operations require keeping a safe cushion for catastrophe claims, but it also produces a float — cash holdings from premiums collected ahead of claims that the company invests.Last year, Berkshire posted a combined $6.6 billion in underwriting profits and investment income tied to its prized and expanding float. So basically, Buffett ""got paid about 6%"" for holding his billions, Miles said. This puts the CEO in an enviable situation.""Buffett doesn't have to be in a hurry to go out and make silly investments,"" he added. ""He is getting paid to wait.""It's Berkshire's portfolio of stock holdings that draws especially intense interest, as Buffett fans try to mimic these investments. In Miles' view, Buffett could hand the cash pile over to Berkshire money managers like Todd Combs and Ted Weschler to buy more shares of Apple or smaller-cap equities.When it comes to stocks, Seifert thinks Buffett is more likely to continue to make equity investments in technology and financials.One thing he won't do? Speculate on some investment driving others to a fever pitch. ""He's not going to buy Bitcoin, I can pretty much guarantee you that,"" Miles said.Morningstar sector strategist Gregory Warren suggests Berkshire should try something new with its growing cash hoard: share repurchases and dividends.But that would mark a change of heart for Buffett. He is famously skeptical of such uses for excess cash, preferring to see it reinvested to grow businesses. But Warren argues that with more than $100 billion on its balance sheet, Berkshire should at least consider ""a large one-time special dividend"" soon.The windfall that will be seen on corporate ledgers after the GOP's tax cuts is expected to result in more repurchases and fatter dividends. And Berkshire stands to gain handsomely from lower taxes too.In September, when Congress was still discussing a 20% rate vs. the 21% that eventually passed, Barclays analyst Jay Gelb wrote that a cut to 20% could add $27 billion to Berkshire's book value by lowering its deferred tax liability and raise its earnings power by about 15%.MORE YOU MAY BE INTERESTED IN:Where Are The Early Investing Hot Spots In Artificial Intelligence?The New Stock Gems: Which Top IPOs Are The Next Googles Or Ciscos?Before You Buy Bitcoin, Read This

40,CTSH,"Financial markets didn't skip a beat last week as reports emerged that President Trump would sign a new order on Friday blocking citizens of Iran and six other predominantly Muslim nations from traveling to the U.S.But it's not surprising that stocks woke up on the wrong side of the bed on Monday after the messy rollout of a policy that temporarily invalidated green cards, stranded hundreds of travelers at airports, sparked large protests and drew condemnation from countries around the world.American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL) led a downdraft among airline stocks after airport protests that didn't exactly present the most inviting picture to welcome travelers. Delta was itself a big part of the news coverage after Trump tweeted that the company's technological snafu that grounded flights was the real cause of weekend chaos at airports.Apple (AAPL) and Starbucks (SBUX) were among the U.S. companies that tried to distance themselves from the policy. Chief Executive Tim Cook said Apple ""would not exist without immigration,"" since Steve Jobs' father came from Syria, target of Trump's indefinite refugee ban.Starbucks committed to hiring 10,000 refugees in the next five years in the 75 countries where it does business. Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google said it's putting up $2 million for groups including the American Civil Liberties Union that work to secure legal protections for immigrants and refugees.Companies have reason to be worried about the symbolism and the real impact on some foreign-born employees. For investors, the moves may lower confidence that Trump will be able to execute his agenda of tax cuts and infrastructure spending that have fueled the market's postelection rally.IBD'S TAKE: If the WTO found the border tax to be illegal, the GOP would face three difficult choices that could throw the ruling party into crisis.Google said it recalled workers on H-1B visas from targeted countries amid concern that they wouldn't be able to return to the U.S. under Trump's order. Now tech companies, in particular, are bracing for another executive order on reform to the H-1B program that provides visas to workers in specialized occupations. Shares of computer services firms including Wipro (WIP) and Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) were under pressure on Monday.For the broad market, the bigger concern is that Trump may be alienating those who he will need to deliver on his agenda. Above all, he'll need the support of at least 49 of 52 Senate Republicans to pass corporate tax reform, which is shaping up to be a contentious battle. The White House is signaling support of House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan for a border-adjusted tax that big importers like Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) are gearing up to fight.While few GOP senators have taken a position on the House approach, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., tweeted that anything that slaps a border tax on Corona would be ""mucho sad."" After Graham and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., criticized Trump's immigration order for making America less safe, Trump lashed out with his own tweet, calling the two ""sadly weak on immigration.""Bloomberg News reported over the weekend that the White House now views the House border-tax plan favorably, calling it the ""most nationalist"" way to reform the corporate tax code. Yet, assuming Trump can find the votes to pass it, the big corporate tax cut could end up backfiring if the World Trade Organization rules that it is illegal, as many experts expect it to do. With Trump praising Brexit, dissing the European Union, sparring with Mexico and bellowing ""America First,"" the chances that the WTO will give America the benefit of any doubt are looking increasingly unlikely.It's not yet clear if Trump's infrastructure package will need Democratic votes to pass, but the wildly anti-Trump sentiment on the left makes it harder for Democratic lawmakers to meet him halfway. At the moment the opposition party is setting a high hurdle for Trump to win their support, laying out their own $1 trillion government-funded package that bares little resemblance to the White House approach of offering $137 billion worth of tax credits as an incentive for the private sector to undertake massive infrastructure projects.All of these challenges come on top of huge uncertainty and disagreement among Republicans about their first order of business: Repealing ObamaCare on a party-line vote and then, somehow, figuring out to replace it without blowing up the individual insurance market.RELATED:Trump Tax Fears: Wal-Mart, Target, Macy's Hit New LowsTrump Wall Stocks Caterpillar, Materials Firms Breaking Out

Gilead reported not-as-bad-as-expected fourth-quarter revenue and earnings, but management's full-year revenue guidance was far below the consensus expectation. Gilead shares have been in steady decline since June 2015, as profits for its controversial hepatitis C drugs started to taper off.Akamai stumbled 11% following strong fourth-quarter results and Q1 guidance that appeared to be in line with expectations. The stock fell nearly 8% from a buy point of 69.36, which triggers a sell rule.A host of other notable names were also in motion early Wednesday as Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) dropped 3%, Time Warner (TWX) added 0.5% and Cognizant Technology (CTSH) leapt 4%.Myriad Genetics (MYGN) rocketed 12% at the open.

The entertainment giant reported mixed fiscal first-quarter results during Tuesday's after hour session, and Chief Executive Bob Iger reported no plans to leave ahead of his contract expiration in 2018.  Disney shares are in buy range above a 106.36 cup-with-handle buy point.Chip developer Inphi (IPHI) rose 1% after reporting fourth-quarter earnings and revenue growth of better than 50%, and guiding first-quarter growth to more than 70% — all well above analyst projections.

43,CTSH,"Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) stock popped on Monday after activist investor Elliott Management disclosed a more than 4% stake in the IT services provider.""We believe that Cognizant can achieve a value of $80 to $90-plus per share by the end of 2017, representing upside of 50% to 69% in just over a year,"" Elliott Senior Portfolio Manager Jesse Cohn said in a letter to Cognizant's board on Monday.Cognizant Tech responded in a statement that it ""welcomes"" communications with shareholders and said it spoke with Elliott after receiving the letter:""Cognizant welcomes open communications with all of its shareholders and values their input ...

""This has been core to our thesis on the stock and our downgrade to market perform last week was supported by our concerns that management was not addressing these issues and continued to be inflexible.""Doradla maintained his market perform rating on Cognizant stock.Elliott Management has recently acquired stakes in other tech companies such as security firm FireEye (FEYE), Citrix Systems (CTXS) and data storage provider EMC, which Dell acquired in September to form Dell Technologies (DVMT).RELATED:Cognizant Stock Plunges On Probe, President ExitsAccenture Spikes To 16-Year High As Earnings Top, Bookings Strong

44,CTSH,"Samsung Electronics will boost shareholder returns and review its corporate structure, the South Korean titan said Tuesday adopting many of the reforms urged by activist fund Elliott Management.Samsung will return 50% of free cash flow to shareholders through next year vs. its prior pledge to return 30%-50%. That implies a return of 9.5 trillion won ($8.1 billion). It will boost dividends by 30% in 2016 to a total of 4 trillion won, with the rest spend on share buybacks.Samsung has a dividend yield of about 1.3% vs. 2% at Apple (AAPL), 2.6% at Microsoft (MSFT) and 3.4% at IBM (IBM).The Korea corporate giant will spend the next six months reviewing the possibility of creating a holding company and listing on more exchanges.All that spells a partial victory for Elliott Management, led by billionair Paul Elliott Singer. Last October, Elliott Management urged a U.S. listing, a 30 trillion won special dividend and a split into an operating company and holding company. Elliott also proposed three independent directors on Samsung's board.Samsung is struggling with the fallout from its Note 7 smartphone overheating fiasco, which tarnished its image and left a product hole as Apple launched its iPhone 7, seen as an incremental not revolutionary handset advance. Samsung also is linked somewhat to an influence-peddling scandal that has engulfed President Park Geun-hye.Elliott Management has been busy, and successful, and spurring companies to boost shareholder value via cash returns or put themselves up for sale.Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) leapt 7% on the stock market today after Elliott disclosed a 4% stake in the IT services firm. It wants Cognizant to buy back $2.5 billion in stock in the first half of 2017.

47,CTSH,"What's hot today won't stay hot forever. That goes for many things in life, including stocks.Stocks can have massive runs, but eventually all good things come to an end. Investors need to recognize this and make way for the new breed of leaders.The time it takes for a leading stock's run to be finally over varies. Some leaders run for weeks, others for years. In a study of the greatest stock market winners from 2000 to 2008, the average time from breakout to peak was 109 weeks — just over two years.In the study, there was a wide range of time frames. The stock with the shortest run, Syneron Medical (ELOS), lasted only 13 weeks. It broke out from an IPO base Aug. 26, 2004, and more than tripled in three months.On the flip side, agricultural chemical giant Monsanto's (MON) reign lasted 266 weeks. It broke out May 13, 2003, and rocketed more than 1,300% before topping in June 2008.Very few companies in the study are on growth investors' radar these days. Companies such as ArcelorMittal (MT), Bebe Stores (BEBE) and DryShips (DRYS) are well off their peaks in the study.Investors who show the skill, and at times luck, to latch on to a monster winner have to learn to say goodbye. Leaders tumble by an average of 72% off their peaks. So it's important not to overstay your welcome.Some leaders in the study such as Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) and MEMC Electronic Materials dived 85% and 90%, respectively. Shoemaker Crocs (CROX) lost nearly all of its value.A downfall in a leader can be due to changes in the company itself or its industry, or simply because a bear market is at hand.Investors can count bases to see if it's getting late in the game. Third- and fourth-stage bases are considered late-stage. Also, watch out for climax sell signals that tend to occur after a stock has had a long, steep advance.Research In Motion dominated the smartphone market for years. The Blackberry maker, which later changed it name to BlackBerry Limited (BBRY), had several huge runs. But Apple's iPhone and smartphones using Google's software platform took market share.When RIMM topped in June 2008 (1), it had tried to clear a fourth-stage base. The stock dropped 30% from a 144.60 buy point in just four months, then collapsed later in the year.

52,CTSH,"You've got to respect and understand the classics.In books, there's ""The Great Gatsby."" In the realm of American food, you've got the burger and fries. And when it comes to chart reading, the most classic pattern is the cup with handle.For decades now, investors who know how to spot this pattern have been reaping profits. The best way to become more familiar with any stock chart pattern is by looking at examples. So it's worth studying the cup-with-handle base that Cognizant Technology (CTSH) formed in 2004.The left side of the pattern began to take shape in January 2004, as Cognizant embarked on what ended up becoming a seven-week losing streak (1). It wasn't until June that Cognizant began etching the right side of its base.In general, a cup-with-handle structure should be at least seven weeks long. But it could also form over the course of a year, or an even longer period of time.The correction within the cup typically should not exceed 35%, and Cognizant fit the bill as it corrected 31%.The handle part of the base represents one last shakeout of weak shareholders before the stock moves to new highs. You generally want to see calm action and just a mild correction within the handle.A good handle will correct only 8% to 12% or less. You might see a slide of up to 15%, but anything beyond that definitely is not ideal. In Cognizant's case, the handle -- which began to develop in July -- featured a correction of 14% (2).A handle also should be at least a week or five trading days in length, although they can be longer. Cognizant took about four weeks to sketch its handle.With any breakout from a base, you want to see strong turnover as the stock moves out of the consolidation. Cognizant certainly delivered convincing volume as it broke out past a 26.74 entry in late July 2004 in big volume (3).However, with the market in poor shape, Cognizant fell more than 8% from that buy point. Investors had to sell and cut losses.The market returned to a confirmed uptrend Aug. 18. The stock rallied again and cleared the 26.74 buy point for good. It also formed a tighter two-week handle in September, offering a new chance to add shares.Some chartists might think Cognizant's pattern also resembled a double-bottom base. But the middle peak in April was a bit low.(Editor's Note: This story originally published in the Jan. 15, 2013, edition of IBD.)

53,CTSH,"Goldman Sachs slashed its price target on Alphabet (GOOGL) stock and reduced its targets on a slew of other tech companies, including Facebook (FB), citing U.K. revenue exposure and volatile currencies in the wake of the U.K. vote for Brexit.Goldman Sachs late Tuesday cut its price target on Google parent Alphabet to 810 from 850. Google stock closed at 691 on Tuesday, down 11% so far in 2016, though shares rose 0.6% to 695.19 in the stock market today.According to Goldman Sachs, tech companies with the most sales exposure to the U.K. include Mimecast (MIME) (39% of its total sales), Rackspace Hosting (RAX) (22%-25%), Zendesk (ZEN) (15%), Accenture (ACN) (13%), BlackBerry (BBBY) (12%), Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) (12%), Facebook (10%) and CyberArk Software (CYBR) (10%).Goldman Sachs lowered its price target on Facebook to 142 from 146. Facebook rallied 1.3% to 114.16 on Wednesday.The investment bank also reduced targets slightly on Adobe Systems (ADBE), Akamai Technologies (AKAM), Salesforce.com (CRM), Workday (WDAY) and Microsoft (MSFT).""We expect an active pre-announcements season potentially beginning next week, with the largest negative impact on companies with back-end loaded license revenue models with June-quarter ends, and companies with high U.K. revenue exposure,"" said the Goldman research report. ""For subscription-based companies, we anticipate a potential impact to deal signings, though note the impact will first be seen on deferred revenue and then flow to revenue.""We anticipate a more modest impact for companies with notable financial hedging, although we still see an impact on deal closures.""Goldman Sachs economists said on Monday that the U.K. could enter a mild recession by early 2017. On Thursday, Britain voted to exit the European Union within two years, though the exact timing is still unclear.Analyst estimates of U.K. revenue exposure vary. MoffettNathanson on Tuesday estimated Facebook's U.K. sales in the ""mid-single-digit range."" Google's U.K. revenue accounts for 9% of total sales, estimated MoffettNathanson, while it's 12% at Priceline (PCLN) and 10% at Twitter (TWTR).

54,CTSH,"Take your eye off iconic copier maker Xerox (XRX) for too long -- heck, Xerox stock had done little more than fall since December 2014 -- and you would have missed its run-up to Tuesday's eight-month high at 11.39, up 34% since touching a nearly three-year low in January at 8.48. Xerox stock closed Friday at 11.16, flat for the session.Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha doesn't see much upside potential, giving Xerox a 12-month price target of 11 and a neutral rating in a research note issued Friday. He does see more first-quarter earnings in Xerox, modeling 1 cent more adjusted EPS than Wall Street's 23-cent consensus, which would be up 10% from the year-earlier quarter. Xerox is scheduled to release Q1 earnings before Monday's open.But Garcha sees slightly smaller sales than the $4.24 billion consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. That Q1 consensus would be a 5.1% decline from 2015's Q1 sales and Xerox's 17th consecutive quarter of shrinking year-on-year revenue, albeit slower shrinkage than the 8% decline in Q4 and 10% contraction in Q3.The rise in Xerox stock may be tied to anticipation over its imminent split into two companies: the legacy copier/printer/office machine business and the business-process outsourcing (BPO) spinoff.Based on $18 billion in 2015 sales, down 8% from 2014, the business-machine side would wind up with about $11 billion a year in sales, and the outsourcing spinoff about $7 billion, Xerox CEO Ursula Burns said when she announced the split on Jan. 29, concurrent with the Q4 earnings release. Inspired by activist investor Carl Icahn, Burns said the breakup would unlock value in both companies. Icahn would get three seats on the new BPO board, while Xerox would get six.BPO sales, grouped currently as services under Xerox, is a ""show me story,"" Credit Suisse's Garcha said.""Management is trying to transition the business away from low-margin to more value-added business,"" he wrote in a research note. ""However, we think management has to show consistent improvement and deliver on results to regain investor confidence.""Garcha anticipates a Q1 decline of 5.4% to $2.4 billion in services revenue.As for the so-called ""document technology"" core hardware, software and document management businesses, Garcha estimates that about $1.6 billion of Xerox's annual cost of goods sold are ""yen-denominated,"" coming from the Fuji Xerox joint venture (75% owned by Fujifilm (FUJIY)). With the yen up about 9% year to date, foreign exchange ""will impact margins,"" but less than was earlier expected, Garcha said.For Q1, Garcha forecasts document tech segment revenue fell 12% to $1.6 billion.Not all of Xerox outsourcing will be part of the BPO spinoff. Document outsourcing, which fell 2% to $852 million in Q4 revenue, will stay with the larger portion of the split, a Xerox spokesman told IBD.Effective April 1, Xerox borrowed $1 billion unsecured from a consortium of seven banks to be repaid within a year or upon execution of the spinoff, whichever comes first. Xerox says the spinoff should be complete before year-end.With a market cap of $11.3 billion, Xerox is the fourth-largest member of IBD's Computer-Hardware/Peripherals industry group, following Canon (CAJ), the newly reorganized HP Inc. (HPQ), and Fujifilm.Xerox carries a middling 66 IBD Compositing Rating. Its formidable BPO rivals, Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) and Infosys (INFY) rate better, with CRs of 75 and 80, respectively.

No surprises are expected when one of the biggest, Infosys (INFY), reports its fiscal 2016 fourth-quarter earnings way after the close Thursday, scheduled for 11:45 p.m. ET -- or about 9:15 a.m. Friday in Bangalore.The consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters suggests Infosys will report earnings up 5% to 23 cents minus items, on revenue up 13.6% to $2.43  billion for the quarter ended March 31.That would be its best revenue growth rate in six quarters and its best earnings growth in the last five quarters.Robert W. Baird analyst David Koning sees the EPS consensus as ""reasonable,"" but anyone expecting a tad above consensus for revenue ""seems aggressive based on historical trends,"" he said in a Tuesday research note. Baird rates Infosys stock neutral, with a 19 price target.Cowen analyst Bryan Bergin, who rates the stock as market perform with an 18 price target, says the company's Q4 ""results tend to be seasonally soft, and we don't expect any surprises there with low single-digit sequential revenue improvement, modeled at 1.4% (quarter to quarter in U.S. dollars, or about 2% in constant currency).""Instead, Bergin said, ""the primary focus will be its FY'17 guide. In sum, expectations are somewhat elevated going into this print, given INFY's recent momentum. We think a year-on-year top-line (in constant currency) growth midpoint of (about) 12% is benchmark for expectations. (We model a foreign-exchange headwind of 2.5%.) Its guide on operating margin will also be a key focus; we think at worst, a flat operating margin target range of 24%-26% is built into expectations, given its ambitious long-term target of 30% by 2020.""Analysts expect fiscal 2017 EPS of 98 cents minus items on revenue of $10.41 billion, up from an expected 90 cents and $9.46 billion, respectively, the previous year. For fiscal 2015, Infosys earned 87 cents per share minus items on $8.61 billion.
"
56,CTSH,"Will Infosys Impact Cognizant?Analyst Koning seems as interested in what Infosys' guidance does for rival Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) as what it does for Infosys. He issued a separate research note just on Infosys' impact on Cognizant.""CTSH likely holds up OK, even if INFY guides fiscal 2017 revenue a bit below the Street,"" Koning said. ""When INFY provided initial full-year guidance below the Street in each of the last three years, INFY was down 5%-21%, but CTSH was (down) 3% to (up) 1%.""Cognizant stock was flat in early trading in the stock market today, near 59.50. Infosys stock was down a fraction, near 18. Cognizant is trading 14% off a 69.80 record high set Oct. 28. Infosys is trading 6% off a 16-year high of 19.49 set April 4.While Infosys earns a strong IBD Composite Rating of 83 -- meaning it's outperforming 83% of S&P 500 companies on earnings, sales, institutional ownership, stock activity and other metrics -- Cognizant rates even better with an 87.Bigger tech outsourcer Accenture (ACN) rates an 89, while the best in the group are the relatively small CGI Group (GIB) (with a 92 CR) and CDW (CDW) (with a 91).As organizations look to digitize their operations and move to the cloud, Cognizant, Infosys and other tech outsourcers are becoming increasingly important as a way to start or accelerate the process, as a means to contract-out process management entirely and as a way to limit or reduce expenses.Service-level agreements “are changing to reflect this (conversion from business-process outsourcing to business-process management), becoming more business-outcome-focused and leading the market to shift from a pure RFP (requests for proposal) procurement approach to a managed-service, end-to-end solution offering,” Cowen's Bergin said in an April 1 research note.

57,CTSH,"You can almost hear the conversation: ""That team did such a great job on that project,"" said CEO Joe Fiction, ""let's give them the entire product line to operate and save some dough.""Converting traditional business process outsourcing (BPO) into business process management (BPM) framed the Indo-U.S. BPO Summit this week in Orlando, Fla., sponsored by the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce and India's National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM). Billed as a first-of-its-kind conference, the timing couldn't have been better, as many of the outsourcers were trading near record highs after a slow start to the year.Service-level agreements ""are changing to reflect this (BPO-to-BPM conversion), becoming more business-outcome-focused and leading the market to shift from a pure RFP (requests for proposal) procurement approach to a managed-service, end-to-end solution offering,"" said Cowen analyst Bryan Bergin in a research note Friday. ""This drives the shift from BPO to BPM and a strategic partner position. The effect of this evolution increases the stickiness of the revenue stream but also ties the fortunes of the provider even closer to that of their client base.""Many BPOs were represented at the show, including Genpact (G), Wipro (WIT), Convergys (CVG) and WNS Holdings (WNS). But Bergin focused on Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) and ExlService Holdings (EXLS) for their ""industry depth and value-added service approaches that position each to win in this evolving landscape,"" he said.Cognizant stock was up a fraction in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 63 but still 10% off its Oct. 28 record high. ExlService stock was up more than 1%, near 52.50, just off of Wednesday's all-time high of 52.92.Wipro stock was up 1%, 5% off its 52-week high. Genpact stock hit a record high Friday and was up nearly 1.5% Friday afternoon. WNS was up 3.5% Friday, just 7% from an eight-week high touched Nov. 2. Infosys (INFY) stock was up more than 1% and near a five-year high. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) stock was up 3% and hit a new record high Friday.""We favor EXLS for its traditional BPO model pairing with an operations consulting business and rapidly growing analytics offering,"" Cowen's Bergin said. ""CTSH is building its BPM via a vertical-specific approach, leveraging its scale and expertise in health care and financial services to drive its (approximately) $1 billion business that is growing faster than the company average. We favor such approaches in the evolving BPM landscape.""Cowen carries ExlService with an outperform rating and a 63 price target. Cowen too rates Cognizant as outperform, with a 65 target.ExlService is a member of IBD's Commercial Services-Outsourcing industry group, which hit a record high Friday. Cognizant is a member of IBD's Computer-Tech Services industry group, which was trading 9% off its all-time high set Nov. 5.Both companies are near the top of their heaps for overall stock and operating performance, with ExlService earning an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of a best possible 99, and Cognizant a 93 CR.

58,CTSH,"Shares of Accenture, the tech outsourcing and consulting company, jumped to a record high Thursday after the company reported a 24% improvement in fiscal second-quarter earnings, well beyond what Wall Street expected. It also beat revenue estimates.The company also raised its earnings guidance for the fiscal year ending in August. The improvements are driven by the digital transformation of Accenture's customers and their fear of disruption, according to the CEO.Accenture (ACN) stock was up 5.5% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, above 113 and up more than 20% from a seven-month low of  93.35 hit on Feb. 9, in the depths of the infamous Software Sag of 2016.Rivals IBM (IBM) and Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) were each up more than 1.7% Thursday afternoon, and India tech outsourcer Infosys (INFY) was up nearly 1%.Dublin-based Accenture said adjusted EPS reached $1.34 after removing income taxes and the gain on the sale of Navitaire, vs. $1.08 a year ago, on revenue up 6% to $7.9 billion.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected EPS of $1.18 minus items for the quarter ended Feb. 29 on revenue of $7.72 billion.""We are benefiting from the focused investments we are making to rotate our business to new, high-growth areas where our capabilities are clearly resonating with the needs of our clients and differentiating us in the marketplace,"" said Accenture CEO Pierre Nanterme in the earnings release. ""At the same time, we continue to manage Accenture with discipline to further enhance our competitiveness. We remain very well-positioned to continue driving profitable growth and delivering value for our clients and shareholders.""In the company's earnings conference call with analysts, Nanterme, echoing his remarks in October,  said, ""The overall economic environment is sluggish, to say the least ... unstable, risky, extraordinarily complex.""He said he is ""not noticing"" much change in the sources of revenue from his customers, but ""it's all about digitalization. ... All the leaders in all the industries are subject to disruption. That's the new factor in town. It's about not being disrupted ... . I see this cycle is here for quite a while. They have to invest (into) rationalization of the operations, IT efficiency ...  across the board ... (which)  is driving our business.""The company guided the current Q3 revenue to $8.1 billion to $8.35 billion, up 7% to 10% in local currency after assuming a 2.5% foreign exchange impact, compared with $8.275 billion a year ago. The midpoint is slightly above analyst views. The company didn't project Q3 earnings, but analysts expect EPS ex items of $1.42, up 9%.Accenture raised its fiscal year earnings guidance to $5.21 to $5.32 per share excluding the after-tax impact of the gain on the sale of Navitaire vs. its earlier guidance of $5.09 to $5.24. Analysts were modeling $5.22, up 8.3% from $4.82 in fiscal 2015. At the new $5.265 midpoint, the fresh guidance represents a 9.2% gain for adjusted EPS.Accenture said sales for its communications, media and technology unit rose 6% to $1.61 billion; financial services also rose 6%, to $1.59 billion; health and public services rose 12% to $1.48 billion; and products rose 8% to $1.85 billion.But resources, which include the struggling energy industry, fell 3% to $1.21 billion.North America sales rose 11% to $3.41 billion, while Europe rose 5% growth to $2.78 billion and growth markets slowed 4% to $1.37 billion.The company declared a semiannual cash dividend of $1.10 per share. In Q2 it repurchased or redeemed 8.1 million shares for $829 million, bringing the total spent  on repurchases to $1.49 billion for the year.With an IBD Composite Rating of 82, Accenture is one of the better performers in IBD's Computer-Tech Services industry group, among the top 18% of all stocks on a variety of metrics, including earnings and sales growth and stock performance. The biggest company in the group, IBM, rates a 55 CR. Infosys has an 87 CR and Cognizant an 84.Image provided by Shutterstock.

59,CTSH,"Seemingly fully recovered from the infamous Software Sag of 2016 in January and February, big-cap Accenture (ACN) is flirting with a record-high stock price amid growth in its services, as it heads towards its fiscal Q2 earnings release due before the market open Thursday.Accenture stock was down a fraction in early trading in the stock market today, near 108, 18% above its seven-month low of 91.40 touched on Feb. 9 and just 2% off an all-time high of 109.86 set Oct. 28.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters on average estimated Accenture earned $1.18 per share minus items for the quarter ended in February, up 9% from the year-earlier period, on revenue of $7.72 billion, down 2.6%. Accenture guided Q2 to $7.62 billion at the midpoint of its range.Dublin-based Accenture ""cited no weakness in its financial services pipeline"" during its Q1 earnings release on Dec. 17, wrote Cowen analyst Bryan Bergin in a recent research note. ""This was (about) three weeks before a tumultuous start to 2016, and nearly two months prior to (services rival Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH)) sounding warning bells in its banking and financial services vertical.""In the Cowen Feb. 25 research note, entitled ""The Sky Does Not Appear to be Falling in Financial Services IT Spending,"" Bergin wrote that ""vendors that have noted service interruption have generally tied such weakness to a handful of specific clients. There have been Indian vendors with reports of healthy internal fiscal 2017 revenue growth targets, (notably Infosys (INFY) and Wipro (WIT)) and positive industry demand narratives across investor days by (Genpact (G), Epam Systems (EPAM) and Tata Consultancy Services) that have not yielded indications of across-the-board financials' spending declines.""He noted that Accenture has grown revenue in financial services in constant currency in four of the last five quarters, although financial clients represent only 21% of Accenture revenue in the last 12 months.In a research note last week, Trefis applauded Accenture for a ""very resilient business model,"" with 45% of its business in outsourcing and 55% in consulting.Cowen rates Accenture stock at outperform, with a 115 price target.With a healthy IBD Composite Rating (CR) of 80, meaning its stock is outperforming 80% of S&P 500 issues in a variety of metrics, Accenture is worth about half of IBM's (IBM) $142.8 billion in terms of market cap. IBM has a weak 56 CR.Infosys, with an 86 CR, has a $42.5 billion market cap, while Cognizant, with an 83 CR, is worth about $36.2 billion based on its stock price.Newly freed from PCs and printers, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) earns a 65 CR, with a $30.4 billion market cap. Slightly smaller Wipro carries a 68 CR, with $30.3 billion in market value.Those six companies comprise the largest members of IBD's Computer-Tech Services industry group.

60,CTSH,"The best-performing international stock mutual funds had a hard row to hoe in the past 10 years. Beating the S&P 500 in each of the past one, three, five and 10 years was too tall an order as sluggish economies and heavy debt burdens afflicted regions spanning Asia, Europe and South America. But many funds were able to top the MSCI EAFE stock index, which tracks foreign developed markets, in each of those periods.The ones that did won the IBD Best Mutual Fund 2016 Award. The award went to 111 international funds out of 411 that have at least $100 million in asset and that have been around for at least 10 years.They run the gamut from big-cap to small-cap funds to one dedicated to India. But they all seem to have one thing in common: a focus on well-managed companies able to maintain pricing power, even during the toughest times.Click Here To View A Table Of Award Winning Funds By CategoryThe top five funds have posted 10-year average annual returns ranging from 8.6% to 11.1%, easily beating the 3% return for the EAFE. The period includes the 2008 market crash, during which the major stock indexes lost about half their value, and many individual stocks fell much more than that.Oppenheimer International Small-Mid Company Fund (OSMAX), in addition to beating the EAFE in all four periods, had the second-highest 10-year average annual return among award-winning international funds: 10.80%.The fund's biggest holdings are Swiss chemicals and biotechnology company Lonza Group; British online supermarket operator Ocado Group; and NICE Systems, an Israel-based company that specializes in telephone voice recording, data security and surveillance. No holding comprises more than 2% of the fund, which has $6 billion in assets.The fund looks for ""companies doing interesting things, pursuing global ambitions and looking to break out and compete with large companies,"" said Rezo Kanovich, who has managed the fund since January 2012.As an example, he cites Ariake Japan, which has developed a process for deriving meat flavors from byproducts such as bones instead of using artificial flavors, which is typically the case in products such as instant noodles and bullion.""They're a world leader in this,"" Kanovich said, adding that Ariake is branching out from Japan in order to pursue further growth in Europe and the U.S.By contrast, Morgan Stanley Institutional Global Franchise A (MSFBX) focuses on companies that are already big and international. The largest holding in the $652 million fund is Nestle (NSRGY), which accounts for nearly 10% of the portfolio. Next is British American Tobacco (BTI), followed by Reckitt Benckiser Group, Unilever (UL) and Microsoft (MSFT).These businesses have growth potential and show resilience in difficult markets.""Owning companies with steady top-line growth (often due to recurring revenue) and the pricing power to protect margins in tough times meant that the portfolio's earnings continued to rise during the financial crisis, while they halved for the market as a whole,"" said Bruno Paulson, a London-based portfolio manager with the Morgan Stanley Global Franchise portfolio.He added that the fund avoids financials, utilities, telecommunications, materials and energy stocks because ""they do not meet our requirements for steady growth."" On the other hand, he said consumer staples ""have been a successful source of companies for the portfolio.""Meanwhile, India may not immediately pop into the minds of U.S. investors looking for consistent long-term growth. But $1.4 billion Matthews India Fund (MINDX) boasts a 10-year average annual return of 11.1% -- highest among the top 5 -- despite the currency, regulatory and other risks that stalk investors in emerging markets.The fund's top holding is big-cap generic drugmaker Taro Pharmaceutical (TARO), with about 5% of assets. Other holdings include consumer finance stock Shriram City Union Finance, large-cap business conglomerate ITC Ltd. and tech services company Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH), a stock that has occasionally appeared in the IBD 50.""Our philosophy of investing in quality stocks for the long term has helped us the most,"" said Sunil Asnani, the fund's lead manager. ""By quality, I mean companies that have a sustainable economic moat and that are run by productive and upright management teams.""In India's context, quality also means that the companies are ""masters of their own destiny, and management is in control and not dependent on some policy measures to become favorable,"" he said.Asnani said export-dependent industries such as IT outsourcing and pharmaceuticals have benefited from the weak rupee in the past few years. He's also found strong companies in the financial services, consumer and materials sectors.""Companies that exhibit pricing power and are better governed have done well in an inflationary environment,"" Asnani said. Inflation in India was 5.7% in January, while the International Monetary Fund has predicted the economy will grow 7.5% this year, among the fastest in the world.""India remains a secular and buoyant growth story"" with a healthy corporate sector and many well-run, entrepreneurial companies, Asnani said. ""Investors with a long-term view and an understanding of the risks involved could consider investing in India,"" he said.Driehaus International Small Cap Growth Fund (DRIOX) and Franklin International Small Cap Growth Fund (FKSCX) round out the five-best performing funds over the past 10 years. However, both are closed to new investors.
"
61,CTSH,"Genpact (G) has made its mark helping companies operate more efficiently, but over the last two years the business processing firm has invested heavily to make its own firm run more effectively.The company, once an India-based arm of General Electric (GE), had gone through some growing pains. The outsourcer for hundreds of companies worldwide -- handling non-core functions such as accounting and finance -- decided it was time to be more selective in the businesses it pursued.Out of the loop went telecom, utilities and government, among other lackluster sectors. More attention was paid to financial services, manufacturing, consumer products, pharma and high tech -- and in finding new ways to service those customers.""We’ve spent about $100 million-plus across a range of new capabilities to take the company to the next level, such as building out mobile and analytical solutions,"" Chief Executive N.V. ""Tiger"" Tyagarajan told IBD.Making such a move came with a price, though. Margins and earnings took a hit initially. In 2014, per-share earnings fell 9%. And as part of that, business from its largest client and former parent, GE, has shrunk to a fraction of what it was.But it’s a different picture now. The strategy to invest in client sectors with the best growth potential and dial back on smaller, less lucrative areas is starting to pay off.""They basically decided to take down their profitability to strategically drive revenue in specific areas,"" analyst Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald told IBD. ""You’ve seen growth rates pick up and positive data points in bookings’ numbers.""Genpact's total revenue in 2015 rose 8% over 2014 to $2.46 billion, but new bookings jumped 20%. Earnings for the year climbed 22% to $1.26 a share. In the fourth quarter, earnings grew 31% to 34 cents a share on revenue of $646.5 million, up 7% from the prior year.Revenue would have been higher had it not been negatively impacted by GE’s business divestitures. In the fourth quarter, GE revenue fell 1% year-over-year to $117 million, accounting for 18% of the total. Non-GE revenue from other global clients rose 10% to $529 million.For the full year, revenue from GE was down 1% to $460 million, representing 19% of total revenue. Global-client revenue grew 10% to $2 billion, or up 13% in constant currency.GE once accounted for 100% of Genpact’s revenue, when it was still an India-based business process management and information technology services arm of the massive U.S. conglomerate. In 2005, Genpact started providing services to non-GE clients, too, as an independent company. It went public in 2007.“As GE continues to change its portfolio, our relationship changes,” Tyagarajan said.About 60% of Genpact’s work is still performed in India. The rest is done in 18 other countries, including Romania, the Philippines, China, Mexico and Hungary. The company is headquartered in New York.The shrinking of GE’s contributions has been especially apparent since last March, when GE announced it would divest its financial services arm, GE Capital. Accelerated GE divestitures will weigh on 2016 results: Genpact expects GE revenue to fall 8% to 10% this year. But it forecasts that revenue from non-GE global clients will rise by 12.5% to 14%.Analysts expect total revenue this year to grow 7% to $2.64 billion, according to a poll by Thomson Reuters. Earnings are seen rising 12% to $1.42 a share.Tyagarajan doesn’t seem worried about lost business from GE.“As GE sells those businesses, it’s natural for us to enter into new relationships with the buyers. The work has to continue,” he said.Of the 12 GE Capital businesses sold so far, Genpact has already entered into contracts with four buyers, including Bank of Montreal (BMO). Tyagarajan says it’s in talks with the eight others.Meanwhile, the outsourcing of business and technology services is a market with a lot of growth left in it, he says.“So much change and disruption in technology is very good for us,” he said. “Our role is to help our clients think about change and help them change.”As Genpact has changed its focus, its client roster has fallen from more than 800 to roughly 700, though Tyagarajan says the value of its contracts has been growing.Clients range from drug-store retailer Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) to manufacturers such as Boeing (BA), Nissan Motor (NSANY) and Honeywell (HON). Consumer products customers include Mondelez (MDLZ) and Kimberly-Clark (KMB). In pharma, it counts AstraZeneca (AZN) and others among its clients.The company’s ties with GE are a ""competitive advantage,"" noted analyst Frank Atkins of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey in a recent note to clients, which came with a buy rating and price target of 30.Among those advantages are GE’s culture of lean principles and systems. What’s more, he noted, many GE execs go on to management roles at other firms, creating an expanded network of potential new client wins for Genpact.""Its relationship with GE and recent investments give it solid positioning versus competitors,"" Atkins wrote. The company also addresses more industry verticals than many of its peers, he said.Genpact competes with pure-play business process management providers WNS (WNS) and ExlService Holdings (EXLS), as well as business processing units of larger global consultancies such as Accenture (ACN) and Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH).Tata Consultancy Services, Wipro (WIT) and Infosys (INFY) are also rivals in certain areas.""Genpact has a longer sales cycle than typical outsourcing companies,"" said Cantor Fitzgerald's Foresi, meaning it takes longer to land a sale and start servicing clients once a deal is signed. ""So the business is potentially stickier.""
"
62,CTSH,"Highly rated but modestly traded Genpact (G) stock bumped up a fraction Friday, after a day of show-and-tell at its analyst day Thursday that spotlighted a surge of growth for the outsourcing business. Many rival stocks were up even more, with Paychex (PAYX) stock up 2% in midday trading in the stock market today.William Blair analyst Anil Doradla came away ""with the sense that business fundamentals were intact and that the company's deal pipeline is healthy,"" he wrote in a research note Friday.Genpact executives suggested that the company had plenty of room for growth in its business process outsourcing market, because revenue for the market overall rose 35%, to $500 billion, in the past year, while Genpact sales rose 8%, to $2.46 billion, Doradla said. But he also said BPO growth will slow.Doradla put Genpact trading at 18.8 times William Blair's 2016 EPS estimate for Genpact, ""a slight premium to its peers in the fast-growth BPO industry,"" which is trading at 17.6 times estimated earnings, he said.BPO is found in more than one industry group. In IBD's Commercial Services-Outsourcing group, Genpact ranks as the fourth-largest company, with a market cap of $5.6 billion. The group is led by Paychex with an $18.9 billion market value, Cintas (CTAS) at $9.5 billion and Aramark (ARMK) at $7.7 billion.Shares of both Cintas and Aramark were up more than 1% midday Friday.IBD's Computer-Tech Services also hosts some heavyweight outsourcers, including Infosys (INFY) with a $40.3 billion market cap, and Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) at $33.9 billion. IBM (IBM) is included in this group, although it does much more than outsourcing.Infosys stock was up a fraction midday Friday, while Cognizant was more than 2% and IBM nearly 2%.Genpact specializes in financial services outsourcing, contributing about 42% of its revenue. Manufacturing and health care are its other two main markets.Sales to its largest customer, General Electric (GE), fell 1% last year to 19% of Genpact's total revenue. Genpact is a GE spinoff.""Overall, we came away with a bullish tone from management, both at a company-specific level and with regard to the overall BPO market,"" Doradla said. ""Management highlighted that the company is witnessing healthy demand in its business and that Genpact has an active deal pipeline.""Some of the key drivers for the upwardly revised figures include customers increasingly viewing BPO companies as transformation partners who not only offer a cost arbitrage, but also provide valuable insights into business operations. Specific areas in which the industry is increasingly engaging clients include IoT, big data and cybersecurity.""Bottom line, we believe that the BPO industry is poised for strong overall growth over the next several years and that Genpact stands to grow at a faster pace than the overall industry due to domain expertise and strong client relationships.""Genpact carries an IBD Composite Rating of 96, with 99 the highest, and currently is an IBD Leaderboard stock. Trading near 26.50 midday Friday, it is within range from a 26 buy point touched last month.

64,CTSH,"The stocks of Eastern European-rooted IT outsourcing companies, including Epam Systems, have seen more downside in recent months than the India-centric ones. But Epam just had a great day.Newton, Penn.-based Epam's (EPAM) stock jumped 14% early Thursday and kept most of that gain through the day, as investors responded to a consensus-beating fourth quarter report that included a 26% revenue surge and mixed guidance.Epam closed up 9.3% in the stock market today at 65.67, still 22% off an all-time high set Dec. 17 at 84.41. The company went public priced at 12 in January 2012.Specializing in software development and testing for tech vendors, EPAM was founded by two Belarusians, one in Princeton. N.J., and the other in Minsk. Founded in Moscow, Luxoft Holding (LXFT), now headquartered in Switzerland, was up 2% Thursday near 51, still 36% off its its Dec. 8 record high of 80.64. Luxoft maintained half its workforce in Ukraine  before war broke out between the government and Russian-backed rebels. It still employs thousands in Eastern Europe as it grows its presence there, in Western Europe and elsewhere.Two of the largest IT consulting and business process outsourcing (BPO) firms, U.S.-based Cognizant Technology Solutions(CTSH) and India-based Infosys (INFY), are trading 19% and 15% below their 52-week high marks, respectively.

Luxoft has a 65.While all four firms support employees outside their workforce bases, they have a more important thing in common: All four look to the U.S. for a plurality, if not a majority, of their revenue.""Epam’s competitive differentiation comes from its highly educated workforce in Eastern Europe and Russia, nearly all of whom hold a master’s equivalent university degree in math, science or engineering,"" said Baron Global Advantage Fund (BGAFX) portfolio manager Alex Umansky in a Dec. 31 newsletter. ""In contrast, most India-based competitors predominantly rely upon recent college graduates with limited experience.""The difference, he said, allows Epam ""to work on higher-value client projects with stronger pricing power than peers"" and makes Epam ""well-suited"" to benefit from rising corporate spending on SMAC, or social, mobile analytics and cloud technologies.Another outsourcer, neither Eastern Europe nor India oriented, ManTech International (MANT), rose 1.5% to close at 27.44 Thursday after rallying as high as 29.14 in the morning. ManTech is 22% off a nearly three-year high set exactly one year ago today, Feb. 18. ManTech specializes in highly sensitive IT for U.S. defense and intelligence agencies. After Wednesday's close, ManTech offered revenue guidance up 5% for 2016, following a 46% slide in sales from 2011 through 2015, prompting Cowen analyst Gautam Khanna to suggest in a Thursday research note that ""growth finally appears plausible.""For Q4, ManTech said diluted EPS fell to 37 cents from 39 cents a year earlier, on revenue of $402 million, down from $411 million in the year before. For the full year, diluted earnings rose to $1.36 per share from $1.27, on sales of $1.55 billion, down from $1.77 billion in 2014.As for Epam Systems, it earned 78 cents per share minus items in Q4, up 26% from a year earlier, beating Wall Street analysts polled by Thomson Reuters by 5 cents, on revenue up 29% to $260 million, beating analyst views by about $9 million. Epam guided adjusted Q1 EPS to 70 cents, short of analyst expectations of 72 cents, on revenue up 29% to $258 million, beating Wall Steet's $250 million estimate. For the year, it guided adjusted EPS to $3.20 vs. analysts' $3.16, on revenue up at least 26% to $1.151 billion, beating Wall Street's $1.122 billion.

65,CTSH,"Optimism over India's new budget from Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent stocks on the Bombay Stock Exchange to the best gain among major global markets Tuesday.The BSE's Sensex benchmark bolted nearly 3.4% higher, its biggest one-day advance since September 2013. But that still left the index still in bear territory, almost 21% below its year-ago high and without a consistent two-week advance since December.Modi's third budget, unveiled Monday, kept the deficit to 3.9%, in line with expectations. It also shifted focus from urban favor to agricultural rural India, which has suffered through a two-year drought.A core aim is to double rural incomes within five years. Projects include a road system and banking and ATM networks reaching all rural villages. The budget pledges government support for irrigation networks, as well as credit increases to farmers.India's budget is still freighted with rising civil service wages, military pensions and more than a score of state-owned banks with portfolios riddled full of bad loans. The country's total public debt is a hefty 65% of GDP, according to the Economist.The budget, and speculation that it implies further interest cuts by the Reserve Bank of India, sent a broad array of stocks higher in Mumbai. Heading that list was ITC, India's biggest cigarette maker, surging 10%.Automakers Maruti Suzuki and Hero MotoCorp rose 8% and 7%, respectively. Port operator Adani Ports leapt 5%.Among India-based companies trading on U.S. markets, ICICI Bank (IBN) gapped up to an 8% gain in heavy trade. HDFC Bank (HDB) powered up by more than 5%.Tata Motors (TTM) kicked up almost 7% and programming houses Wipro (WIT) and Infosys (INFY) each gapped up to 3% gains. The only one of these issues in a possible base is Infosys, five weeks into a potential cup.Among companies based outside of India but with a major portion of their human resources in the country, Bermuda-based Genpact (G) showed little response Tuesday. It trimmed early gains, ending up 0.6%.

IT business process outsourcing (BPO) rivals Infosys (INFY) and Accenture (ACN) were each down about 2% midday Tuesday.And IBM (IBM) stock was down more than 1.5% Tuesday. Its new IBM Watson Health is geared specifically to getting hospitals and medical practices migrating toward better electronic health records. Health care software vendor Athenahealth (ATHN), which has been struggling near seven-month lows, was down 1%.""Rising medical costs, consumerization of health care and a changing regulatory environment, among other things, are driving industry consolidation in the payer industry,"" said Cognizant President Gordon Coburn in the company's earnings conference call with analysts. ""We're seeing some slowdown in our health care practice due to this consolidation, particularly in the early part of this year, as reflected in our Q1 guidance.""That said, we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunities within the payer segment and are quite encouraged by the large deal pipeline in this area for 2016. As the health care industry shifts from fee-for-service to value-based care models, health care organizations are simultaneously looking for new ways to deliver consumer-centric care while driving operational efficiencies.""

67,CTSH,"Highly rated business process outsourcing firm Cognizant Technology Solutions gapped down 8% after the Monday stock market opening bell, shortly after management disappointed investors with guidance lower than Wall Street expected for the first quarter and 2016.Cognizant (CTSH) beat analysts estimates for Q4 earnings growth and came in short of analysts' revenue expectations. Its stock fell as low as 53.46 early Monday in a rough market, 23% below its all-time high 69.80 reached Oct. 28. Shares were down 7% midday in the stock market today.Cognizant stock enjoys a high IBD Composite Rating of 90, meaning it's performing better than 90% of stocks across a variety of metrics. That's a hair better ranking than its larger business process outsourcing (BPO) rivals Infosys (INFY), somewhat better than Accenture (ACN) and far better than IBM (IBM). Like Cognizant with huge operations in India, Infosys was down 5% at midday Monday. Accenture about 4.5% and IBM was off 1%.A new concern for BPO companies -- not that they haven't been competing already -- is Xerox's (XRX) BPO spin-off, announced just 10 days ago. Xerox has been offering outsourcing for years, but as a free-standing publicly traded company its BPO is likely to receive heightened attention in the market. Cognizant declines to discuss Xerox, a spokeswoman said. Xerox stock was down about 5% at midday.Cognizant said the current Q1 earnings per share should reach 78-80 cents on revenue of $3.18 billion to $3.24 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters thought Cognizant could do better on earnings, expecting adjusted EPS up 12% to 81 cents from 71 cents a year ago, on sales up 14% to $3.319 billion from $2.911 billion in Q1 2015.For Q4 2015, Cognizant said it earned 80 cents per share minus items, up 19.4% from 67 cents a year earlier, on revenue up 17.9% to $3.23 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had on average been expecting 78-cents EPS minus items on $3.24 billion in revenue.""Our cash and investment balances, net of debt, grew by $1.5 billion during 2015 due to our strong business performance and strong cash flows,"" said CFO Karen McLoughlin in Cognizant's earnings release. She said Cognizant spent more than $375 million buying back stock in 2015, ""reflecting our commitment to drive shareholder value.""Said President Gordon Coburn: ""While digital opportunities significantly expand our addressable market, our rapidly growing consulting, infrastructure and business process services and geographic market expansion, continue to be solid drivers of demand for our services.""Cognizant and Infosys recovered in December from heavy flooding in Chennai, India, where they employ tens of thousands of workers.

68,CTSH,"Xerox and activist shareholder Carl Icahn announced Friday that Xerox will split into two companies by spinning off its business-processing outsourcing (BPO) activities to shareholders, typically intended as a tax-free transaction alternative to selling a spin-off.The shrinking Xerox (XRX) -- once ubiquitous for its revolutionary photocopiers but now struggling as people rely more on digital documents on screens rather than paper documents -- has not increased annual revenue since 2011, when sales hit $22.6 billion after it bought Affiliated Computer Services.Also Friday, Xerox disclosed fourth-quarter adjusted earnings up 3% to 32 cents per share, its first quarterly earnings gain in a year and 4 cents better than the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. But that was on revenue down 8% to $4.653 billion. Analysts had expected $4.728 billion. For the year, adjusted earnings fell 8.4% to 98 cents per share on sales down 7.7% to $18.045 billion, the company reported before the market open.Xerox stock was trading up 6.5% to near 10 in afternoon trading in the stock market today, but was still 30% off a 14.02 high set Feb. 20. The stock hit a 31-month low of 8.48 on Jan. 20.Xerox stock carries a weak IBD Composite Rating of 43, meaning about 57% of publicly traded stocks are performing better. Competitors for investor capital in its industry include highly rated Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH), which carries a near-perfect 98 CR, and Infosys (INFY) with a 94 CR, among others.Cognizant stock was up about 3% and Infosys was up 3.5% in afternoon trade Friday.Business process outsourcing revenue, according to Xerox's 2015 financials, slipped 4% to $1.786 billion in Q4, compared with a year earlier, amounting to 38% of Xerox's total sales. Document outsourcing, down 2% to $852 million in Q4, will remain with Xerox, a spokesman told IBD.Xerox's BPO sales are smaller than Cognizant's, which generates about $3 billion quarterly, and Infosys', which does about $2.4 billion quarterly.The BPO ""decline was primarily driven by the anticipated run-off of the student loan business and our third-quarter 2015 decision to not fully complete the Health Enterprise implementations in California and Montana,"" Xerox said in its earnings release. ""Partially offsetting this decline was moderate acquisition contribution and organic growth in several lines of business.""Xerox said BPO revenue came 45% from business groups excluding health care, 27% from the public sector, 15% from commercial health care accounts and 13% from government health care.Xerox Chair and CEO Ursula Burns said the deal with Icahn ""ensures that we will have strong leadership and best-in-class governance for the new (BPO) Business Process Outsourcing company.""Said Icahn: ""We strongly believe that an independent BPO company with fresh, focused leadership and best-in-class corporate governance will greatly enhance shareholder value. . . .”They said the new company board will have six directors appointed by Xerox and three named by Icahn. A committee named by Xerox has begun searching for an ""external candidate"" to be the BPO CEO.

71,CTSH,"With Frank Caruso at the helm since mid-February 2012 -- almost exactly four years -- the $2.7 billion AB Large Cap Growth Fund (APGAX) has topped 98% of its peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. through Jan. 31.The fund notched a 14.55% average annual gain in that time vs. 10.71% for its direct rivals and 12.08% for the S&P 500. It garners an A+ 36-month Performance Rating from IBD, meaning it's performance is among the top 5% of all mutual funds in that time.Lately, the mutual fund has shown it can outperform in ugly markets as well as in beautiful ones. By losing less than its peers and the broad market over the turbulent past three months, the fund ranked in the top 8% of its category. It fell 6.08% last month, a little better than the average U.S. diversified stocks fund's 6.25% decline.Caruso, who is 59 years old, is a member of the AB fund complex, which last year changed its name from AllianceBernstein. Caruso, the lead manager on this fund, discussed with IBD at his Manhattan office how his team invests.IBD: How have you achieved outperformance in bad markets as well as good?Caruso: It's our focus on great businesses, our obsession with the fundamental integrity of holdings and the way we manage risk. Looking at data from March 31, 2012, through Dec. 31, in the 28 up months in that time we were in the 23rd percentile of our peers. In the down months, we were in the 2nd percentile, beating 98% of our peers. The risk-adjusted performance of the portfolio is extremely good.IBD: Business cycles are not your focus, right?Caruso: I don't want people to associate with us any overarching concern about business cycles. We look for consistent performance. That's particularly important in growth stock investing. Companies we want need to have the kind of business that has a long runway to invest those high returns and earn returns in excess of their cost of capital. So it's a combination of persistence and duration that creates and unleashes the power of compounding. Rather than saying we look for high-growing companies, we look for returns and look for that in these really good businesses.IBD: You are looking for companies that can meet your requirements for several years, right?Caruso: Our window is three to five years. For companies in the Russell 1000, you've got a high-teens number of earnings forecasts for this year and next, then it falls off a cliff. As you get fewer estimates three, four, five years out, the variability about forecasts increases a lot. Longer time horizons lead to inefficiency in growth stock investing.IBD: In other words, by having a longer time horizon than most other investors, it's easier for you to find companies that are priced inefficiently?Caruso: It is. Absolutely.IBD: What's a recent example, please?Caruso: Most investors look at Nike (NKE) and see one of the most efficiently priced stocks in the market. But that changes longer-term. What's provocative is that they've been experimenting with new manufacturing technology, a weaving technology. Most people would say Nike's biggest cost is labor. But it's not. It's shipping, tariffs and duties. You can eliminate a lot of those if you localize manufacturing. Weaving technology might let them do that. Instead of (needing a lot of low-paid) workers cutting, banging, stitching, gluing, coloring and packing products, what if they have . . . smaller factories all over the world, decreasing those shipping, tariff and duties costs?So when we model Nike, we can push the profitability up by hundreds of basis points. That gives us confidence in the long term. It informs us about how we might want to behave in the short term if there's volatility.IBD: For a manager who pays little attention to the short term, you're doing well in the short term. Luck or design?Caruso: The fact that stocks go up and down doesn't impact the way we manage the portfolio. Having said that, a year ago we had had good, consistent performance for the last four years. We started to see a lot of risk exposure to momentum (stocks), and we spent the entire year managing that down to more conservative levels. And we have seen reversion to the mean.IBD: In the recent months of volatility, what have you trimmed and what have you added to?Caruso: Part of why we've done well in 2016 is that the market continues to be concerned about earnings, and our portfolio is delivering. But we've reduced our size in excess winners last year and redeployed into more, not defensive, but more edgy, controversial companies that had not been leadership stocks. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is one of those names.IBD: Which of the FANGs do you own, and which have you trimmed?Caruso: We don't own Amazon.com (AMZN) or Netflix (NFLX). We have Facebook (FB) and Google (Alphabet (GOOGL)), and haven't trimmed them.We've been more inclined to trim some discretionary stocks. We took profits and reduced positions in Starbucks (SBUX) and Nike because we thought in the moment it was pretty fully valued. But we would welcome an opportunity to build that back through volatility.Disney (DIS) was trimmed. Monster (MNST) and Staples (SPLS) -- which has been a phenomenal performer -- were trimmed.What we've added to: Last summer, we were basically market weight in health care, a little overweight. Those were put through the grinder in late summer, early fall. Into and emerging from that correction, we started increasing our exposure there. We added to Intuitive Surgical last summer. We rebalanced into Biogen (BIIB). We introduced (a position in) Edwards Lifesciences (EW).We did a number of things in tech. We introduced Adobe (ADBE) and Cognizant (CTSH), and we did some adds to longer-term positions, such as ServiceNow (NOW).IBD: Why do you like Intuitive Surgical?Caruso: The company has unbelievable returns. It has $3 billion in enterprise cash and no debt. We’re seeing the utilization of robotics in an ever-increasing number of procedures.For this company to win long-term, we must see more surgeon adoption of robotics, and we’re seeing that. The stock suffered a fair amount of underperformance the past couple of years. But we stuck to our knitting. We added to our stake opportunistically, and we’re starting to see a contribution to fund performance from this stock.IBD: You weren’t in on Facebook’s IPO, but you bought when many others were fleeing. What’s your thesis?Caruso: We were controversial buyers when the rest of the Street was puking it out. We’re proud of that.If you go back to the IPO in the summer of 2012, every banker that bought them had a five-year forecast model -- 2016 was the terminal year. Now their current forecasts are 40% to 60% higher than they were back then. My point is that fundamentals overachievement is really hard to model. But Facebook has potential to drive tremendous excess performance.IBD: Go back to Monster Beverage: Why did you trim it?Caruso: They were on the verge of deploying a lot of capital to be able to sell overseas. Then Coke (KO) took a strategic position in the company. As shareholders, we appreciated before many others that Monster would not have to spend $1 billion to become a global company. They would be able to leverage Coke’s best-on-the-planet global distribution platform. They would get to profits we thought they'd see in 2017-18 in the year 2016.The growth opportunity is increasing exponentially. So the sizing decision was really another one of those Starbucks-type decisions, where these have been unbelievably successful stocks. But the valuations got a little uncomfortable in the short term, so we reduced our exposure. There’s no diminution of our long-term conviction.IBD: You boosted your current stake in Cognizant in between September and November. What’s the attraction?Caruso: They bring a level of expertise in software-as-a-service and mobility solutions to companies that are trying to figure out how to get their IT architecture to the next level.Positioning in key technologies interests us. Cognizant was a stock we talked about at the end of 2013. We stepped away and more recently started to build it back.IBD: Adobe posted earnings-per-share gains for five quarters after suffering EPS declines in seven of the eight prior stanzas. What’s the crux of why things are working?Caruso: They used to put a product in a shrink-wrapped box and sell it. They’ve switched to a subscription model. That allows them to be consistent in how upgrades are managed and deployed. Customers don’t have to wait for upgrades. That model is destined to compress the ups and downs of their business. The lower volatility that results is good from a valuation point of view. And this model lets them manage the risk of piracy in a more head-on fashion. So the long-term value of their subscription model is more attractive than their old model.IBD: Are you among the investors who started to like Alphabet more when the company brought in Ruth Porat as CFO?Caruso: Yes, we became excited when they brought in Porat from Morgan Stanley (MS).Google had a great business, focused on search. But they used cash flow to fund a variety of initiatives that in many cases didn’t appear to make a lot of sense.With the appearance of a strong CFO, we hoped there was finally an adult in the room who would bring financial discipline to the way they thought about allocating capital. So far, she’s done that.Now they’ve got two companies, basically. One is focused on advertising, whether it’s YouTube, which is growing into an economically handsome property, or search.Then you’ve got essentially all of these call options about driverless cars, robotics. They’ve been deploying capital to build out telecom networks in cities. So it’s a portfolio of early-stage companies, some acquired, some nurtured, some ready for prime time, some needing more incubation.The split in the company lets investors have more transparency to properly value the businesses.

72,CTSH,"The market is back in an uptrend, but the S&P 500 is still trading below its high from May. It is easy to see eight months of a struggling market reflected in IBD’s blue chip Big Cap 20 list. Fully 14 stocks on the current list qualify as defensive names.Utilities including Southern Energy (SO), Consolidated Edison (ED) and WEC Energy Group (WEC) are defensive because their prices to consumers are generally locked, and customers have little choice but to use the product. Also, the stocks typically offer healthy dividends.Another factor: Utilities are a segment into which mutual funds working to maintain minimum levels of investment rotate into during choppy markets. This demand can hold share prices steady or even drive them higher while the general market corrects.On the other hand, four stocks on the list qualify as solid growth stocks: Cognizant Technologies (CTSH),  Equinix (EQIX) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG).McDonald’s (MCD) carries some combined traits of defensive and growth stocks, giving it an interesting leg up in the current market. The fast-food chain’s turnaround under new Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook has made the stock a growth contender with regard to a number of fundamental and technical attributes: earnings growth, same-store-sales, relative strength and accumulation/distribution.McDonald’s still falls short on the standard punch list of CAN SLIM elements. But the turnaround has made the stock much more attractive for investors looking for healthy dividend names and/or double-threat defensive plays.McDonald’s, which fell off the list Monday, was extended after last week’s bounce off its 10-week moving average, and from a breakout in October.Dollar General (DG) was a double-threat growth/defensive stock from its re-entry to public markets in November 2009 through July 2012. It and its now-merged competitors Family Dollar and Dollar Tree (DLTR) were grabbing market share from Wal-Mart (WMT) and buying up smaller, regional chains across the U.S. Dollar General’s EPS growth is forecast at a healthy 13% for the year ended in January, and 15% in 2017. Revenue growth has slowed to high single digits.O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY) torqued up nearly 1290% from October 2008 to October 2015. During that period, when the market was choppy or in a correction, auto parts chains were seen as dual growth/defensive plays because they were consolidating and gaining market share while benefiting from consumers holding on to their cars longer than they had in the past.O’Reilly, which announces its Q4 results on Feb. 10, is forecast to remain in the camp through 2015 with full EPS growth forecasts of 24%. Revenue growth is seen slowing to 8%. For 2016, analyst consensus puts EPS growth at 14% and sales growth at 7%.Big Cap 20 stocks tend to be stable, healthy performers, but they are not a list of pick-and-play buy opportunities. Investors need to look carefully at the fundamentals and make sure they understand both the company and its value proposition. Sudden changes in market direction can generate significant changes in the companies on the list.

75,CTSH,"Just like clockwork, and as usual, India-based Infosys (INFY) is scheduled to kick off tech's December-quarter earnings season after the close Wednesday (Thursday morning in India), followed by Intel (INTC) after the close Thursday — with many more reports coming over the next three weeks.Infosys, an outsourcing company, is usually good for about 3% sequential revenue growth for its fiscal third quarters, which end Dec. 31; but this past Q3 may have been weaker.Analysts note that business process outsourcing (BPO) demand has softened — and BPO is Infosys' main line of business, with strength in financial IT. November and early December brought flooding in Chennai, India, where Infosys, New Jersey-based rival Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) and other outsourcers were forced to close operations temporarily. Tens of thousands of Infosys and Cognizant employees were out of work.Infosys stock, like almost all stocks, suffered in the stock market's plummet the first week of the year, though it rebounded a fraction on Friday. Still, shares fell 3.5% for the week and now trade 17% off their near post-dot-com-bubble high of 19.46, set Oct. 5. The S&P 500 fell 6% in the Jan. 4 week.David Koning, an analyst with investment banker Robert W. Baird, figures that the Indian monsoons and weaker outsourcing demand might have depressed Infosys' sales 3% last quarter from Q2.Thomson Reuters' analyst consensus estimates Q3 revenue at $2.37 billion, up 8.4% from the year-earlier quarter but down 0.5% from Q2. Analyst consensus has Q3 earnings flat, at 23 cents per share.Koning cited a $2.39 billion revenue consensus and Baird's own $2.4 billion estimate as ""generally reasonable to a bit high."" He wrote, ""Competitor commentary generally reflects flattish sequential growth"" and added, ""Several IT companies (i.e., Syntel (SYNT), Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro (WIT) have indicated that the Chennai flooding would be a material headwind to revenue. INFY has not provided an update, though the Street revenue estimate is down (about 50 basis points) since the end of October.""On the Infosys earnings conference call, Koning said that he'll be listening for ""aggressive pricing, methods to combat high attrition and impacts from Chennai flooding, (which) could all negatively impact margins this quarter.""Going forward, higher visa costs and foreign exchange benefits dissipating (about 250-300 basis points benefit this year) could hurt margins too,"" he said.Cognizant stock fell 7.1% the Jan. 4 week to 55.76, 20% off its Oct. 28 all-time high. Syntel fell 2.4% to 44.15, 17% off its March all-time high. Wipro fell 3.3% to 11.16, down 21% from its July nine-month peak.Follow Gary Shaw on Twitter @IBD_Gshaw and on Facebook .

76,CTSH,"Should Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) buy Perot Systems from Dell? David Koning, an analyst with investment bank Robert W. Baird, finds that's a fine idea and ""nicely accretive,"" according to his research note Monday.
"
77,CTSH,"Citing sources, Reuters on Thursday said Dell was looking to sell Perot, naming Cognizant, Japan's NTT Data and France's Atos as ""competing"" for the acquisition. Reuters said the estimated $5 billion Perot might fetch could help ease Dell's $66 billion pending acquisition of EMC (EMC). The merger of privately held Dell and EMC, should it pass regulatory muster, would be the largest merger of pure tech companies ever.

79,CTSH,"Dell bought Perot from founder Ross Perot in 2009 for nearly $4 billion to boost Dell's consulting and outsourcing businesses, especially data services to doctors and hospitals in the throes of converting paper files to digital data. New Jersey-based Cognizant is primarily an IT outsourcer, with much of its operations in India.
"
80,CTSH,"Koning estimates Perot revenue at $3.1 billion annually, which is roughly 22.5% of Cognizant's annual revenue. He estimates Perot's EBITDA — earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization — at about $470 million, or roughly 15% of Cognizant's EBITDA. He expects the combination would create about $50 million worth ""of synergies."" Cognizant's $3 billion of net cash in the bank could swing to $2 billion in debt, depending on how Cognizant financed the acquisition, he says.

The merger of privately held Dell and EMC, should it pass regulatory muster, would be the largest merger of pure tech companies ever.Cognizant stock rose a fraction Thursday when the story broke, but later fell a fraction, to 60.50, in the stock market today, 13% off its all-time high set Oct. 28.Dell bought Perot from founder Ross Perot in 2009 for nearly $4 billion to boost Dell's consulting and outsourcing businesses, especially data services to doctors and hospitals in the throes of converting paper files to digital data. New Jersey-based Cognizant is primarily an IT outsourcer, with much of its operations in India.Koning estimates Perot revenue at $3.1 billion annually, which is roughly 22.5% of Cognizant's annual revenue. He estimates Perot's EBITDA — earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization — at about $470 million, or roughly 15% of Cognizant's EBITDA. He expects the combination would create about $50 million worth ""of synergies."" Cognizant's $3 billion of net cash in the bank could swing to $2 billion in debt, depending on how Cognizant financed the acquisition, he says.Bottom line? Maybe 20 to 25 cents per share of improvement to Cognizant's annual earnings, Koning says. ""Investors sometimes don't like the strategic fit but end up giving credit for accretion,"" he wrote.He says concerns include the likely dilution of Cognizant's growth, the view that Perot might be a ""lower-quality asset,"" and ""investor fears around (the) strategic fit.""

111,CTSH,"Luxoft (LXFT) stock gapped up to a new high Wednesday after the tech service firm late Tuesday reported earnings and revenue that beat Wall Street expectations.The third-party software developer also raised its fiscal 2016 guidance for profit and sales.Luxoft rose as much as 10% in the stockmarkettoday, above 77, and was up 7%, above 75, in afternoon trading.Luxoft reported second-quarter earnings minus items of 84 cents a share, up 45% from the year-earlier, smashing analyst expectations for 71 cents.Sales rose 29% to $161.5 million for the quarter ended Sept. 30, beating Thomson Reuters analyst consensus of $159.9 million.Luxoft's annual sales growth hasn't been below 24% since the June 2013 quarter, and its EPS growth has exceeded 22% in all but two quarters since then, growth rates that would be the envy of much-bigger rivals IBM (IBM) and Accenture (ACN).For fiscal '16 ending March 31, Luxoft raised its adjusted EPS guidance to at least $2.60 per share vs. $2.55 guided previously, on revenue up at least 24% to $645.5 million instead of the earlier 23% estimate. Analyst consensus suggests $2.76 EPS on $661.93 million for fiscal '16.Luxoft is among the healthiest in IBD's Computer-Tech Services industry group, where only Tyler Technologies (TYL) and Virtusa (VRTU) share the best-possible 99 Composite Ratings with Luxoft. Cognizant Technology (CTSH) and Epam Systems (EPAM) both have 98 CRs. IBM, though, has a low 44 CR. It's by far the largest company in the group, with a market valuation of $130.7 billion, followed by Accenture's $63.4 billion. Luxoft is barely above a small cap, with a $2.5 billion valuation.The Computer-Tech Services group ranks No. 5 out of 197 that IBD tracks.In a corporate presentation distributed Wednesday that notes its 30.7% annual growth rate since going public in 2013, vs. the 20% the company suggested two years ago, Switzerland-based Luxoft cited some of its largest customers.Its financial service customers include Deutsche Bank (DB) and Citi (C).Auto industry customers include Delphi (DLPH) and Ford (F).Other customers are Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Juniper Networks (JNPR) .In Luxoft's earnings release, CEO Dmitry Loschinin said the company won ""several landmark contracts with high potential accounts (HPAs) and (we) maintain a healthy pipeline of opportunities ahead.

"
113,CTSH,"A bout of recent investor jitters took a bite out of its shares this week, but Epam Systems continues to rank as a strong performer that shows potential.Epam (EPAM) competes with the likes of huge names in computer tech services such as IBM (IBM), Accenture (ACN), Infosys (INFY) and Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH). Yet the provider of outsourced software engineering and other IT services holds its own — and often bests the other players — with a stock price that's up 50% for the year.And the company says that it's not slowing down.""We are hiring people across all locations,"" Chief Executive Arkadiy Dobkin said Thursday on an earnings call with analysts. ""Over the last 18 months, we have expanded in Central and Eastern Europe, as well as in Latin America. We look at this from a global perspective of how to grow clients.""Although he has an overweight rating on the stock, JPMorgan analyst Alexei Gogolev is nevertheless bullish on Epam's growth prospects. He cites its ""unique delivery capabilities and rising demand for offshoring as an underpenetrated form of IT delivery.""RoadblocksBut there are roadblocks standing in Epam's way. For one, the company's earnings report this week left a number of questions unanswered as Epam suffered a rare hiccup in an otherwise stellar run of late.Reporting after the close on Wednesday, Epam logged third-quarter adjusted earnings of 70 cents a share. That was up 17% from the prior year and 2 cents above consensus analyst views. However, revenue fell short of estimates, growing 22% to $236 million vs. estimates for $239 million.Part of the problem was currency-exchange headwinds. More than half of Epam's business comes from outside the U.S., which means the strong U.S. dollar can drag on results.The company also does a lot of business in Ukraine, where tensions with Russia have been a challenge. Meanwhile, Epam must deal with rising inflation in the Russia-dominated Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).On the analyst call, Chief Financial Officer Anthony Conte said that currency ""remains a big piece of our story, suppressing our Q3 revenue by about 8%."" He also said that a ""significant slowdown"" in the Russian banking industry, coupled with the weak ruble, hurt business in Epam's important banking/financial segment.Weakness In RussiaJPMorgan's Gogolev reiterated that point in a Thursday morning note, saying, ""Low-teens growth of the financial services vertical comes on the back of continued weakness of the Russian banking industry.""Wall Street's reaction was negative. Leading up to the Wednesday report, Epam shares fell 4% for the day. On Thursday, investors initially panicked, sending down shares more than 11% in early trades. But the market thought better of it, and Epam pared its losses to 5% by the close, ending the day at 71.69.Those investors may be noting that even with the revenue miss, Epam's results continued a streak of 12 straight quarters of double-digit per-share earnings and revenue growth. Epam shares touched a record high of 81.95 on Oct. 7.That kind of strong, consistent growth has made Epam one of the top stocks in IBD's Computer-Technology Services group, which ranks No. 3 out of 197 industries tracked. Epam can't match IBM, Accenture, Infosys and Cognizant for billions of dollars in annual revenue. But it's the leader of the pack in the Investor's Business Daily Composite Rating, with a best-possible score of 99.Epam provides outsourced software engineering and other IT services to clients worldwide, though most of its business is in North America and Europe. Its portfolio of services includes product and application development, technology consulting, infrastructure and hosting, application testing, and maintenance and support. End markets include banking and finance — its biggest — as well as retail, travel, media and entertainment, software, technology, health care and life sciences.Buying And GrowingEpam has used a combination of organic growth and acquisitions to more than double its revenue over the past three years and gain more market share.Its latest buyout came in July, when it acquired NavigationArts, a digital consulting and content management firm with clients including Marriott International (MAR), privately held Ernst & Young and Time Warner Cable (TWC).Epam's biggest client is Swiss financial giant UBS (UBS), which accounts for more than $100 million in annual revenue. That's a pretty big chunk, considering that analysts expect Epam's 2015 revenue to be about $910 million.Its revenue from UBS rose more than 20% during the third quarter, Conte said on the conference call.""The growth there remains solid and strong. It was pretty much in line with what we expected it to be,"" he said. Conte noted that growth wasn't limited to just UBS, adding, ""We continue to gain traction and grow our business with the top clients.""The company says that revenue from Epam's top five customers grew about 20% from a year earlier, while revenue from the top 10 grew about 25%.In terms of geographic markets, Conte said, North America ""continues to be our strongest sector,"" helped by the strong U.S. dollar. ""We are seeing growth across all verticals in North America.""On the downside, Epam has now reported two straight quarters of decelerating revenue growth, which analyst Gogolev said ""may be partially explained by tougher (year-over-year) comps.""Still, the company continues to expand its operation and payroll. It ended the quarter with around 14,000 information technology professionals.Such expansion should help Epam continue its strong financial gains. It expects year-over-year revenue growth to be ""at least"" 30% this year. The company also said that its full-year EPS should be ""at least"" $2.65. That's below the $2.69 expected from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters but would still represent a 19% gain.

129,CTSH,"Whether the stock market is enjoying a big market uptrend or bobbing up and down like a buoy in the ocean, earnings growth still matters. The numerous positive surprises in earnings-per-share gains that large-cap companies have issued across the market in the past couple of weeks have certainly helped investors feel more bullish.Earnings research firm S&P Capital IQ sees third-quarter earnings dropping 3.8% among S&P 500 firms to $28.92 a share. That's a solid improvement from the 5% decline seen on Oct. 6. Plus, earnings would likely be up 4.5% for the S&P 500 minus the energy drag.A 4.5% overall gain might not be something to hoot and holler about. The mild increase reflects an economy that is still recovering at a modest pace. Revenue increases have been equally weak. In that light, today's IBD Big Cap 20 screen can be useful in guiding readers to the small minority of companies that are growing much faster.Do not forget that 25% EPS growth is the minimum threshold for IBD's CAN SLIM stock selection system. Consistent double-digit profit increases that fall short of that high bar are still acceptable for large, established companies.Growth deceleration, as seen in former Big Cap 20 component Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) (EPS up 52%, 47%, 27% and 11% in the past four quarters) can knock the stock's EPS Rating down and spark sell-offs.Today, Chipotle is still a great business with outstanding products, service and management. Yet for now, the hot sauce is missing from its quarterly numbers. Thus, the stock is no longer on the screen.Southwest Airlines (LUV) is coming off a thrilling ride, thrusting ahead 11.5% last week for its fourth straight up week.Some traders might say that the reason lies in the stock's ""cheap"" valuation, currently 14 times trailing 12-month earnings per share. But a bigger reason may be the company's outstanding job in delivering above-normal profit growth.

Accenture has received mixed reviews from Wall Street in recent months, as investors and analysts struggle to figure out where the company is going ahead of its fourth-quarter earnings report, due Sept. 24.Zacks downgraded Accenture shares earlier this year to sell from hold. But Cowen and Co. upgraded shares to outperform from market perform. And Evercore ISI and Robert W. Baird recently raised their price targets on shares.Included among its rivals are such tech giants as IBM (IBM), Infosys (INFY) and Cognizant (CTSH). Accenture hasn't performed as well as such companies as Cognizant and CDW (CDW) in its sector, but it has an IBD Composite Rating of 84, ahead of most of the pack, including IBM and Computer Sciences (CSC).Accenture stock reached an intraday high of 105.37 on Aug. 10 and quickly faded within two weeks. Shares tumbled to an intraday low of 88.43 on Aug. 24 before mounting a recovery.Follow Russ Britt on Twitter @IBD_RBritt and on Facebook.

220,CTSH,"Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) is no stranger to the acquisitions game. The provider of information technology, consulting and business process outsourcing has made 16 buys since 2010. Its acquisition strategy has been to focus on geographic expansion and strengthening its industry knowledge or technological abilities, Cognizant President Gordon Coburn told IBD.
"
221,CTSH,"Until recently, most buys had been tuck-in acquisitions for $200 million or less. The exception came in November, when Cognizant closed on the $2.7 billion purchase of TriZetto, a privately held provider of health-care IT software that helps payers and providers work more efficiently together.
"
222,CTSH,"TriZetto could have wound up elsewhere, though few firms could have provided a healthier home. Only IBM (IBM), Accenture (ACN) and Infosys (INFY) enjoy larger market caps than Cognizant's $40.9 billion in IBD's Computer-Tech Services industry group, although Wipro (WIT) isn't far behind. But Cognizant is the only member of the industry group to earn the highest possible 99 Composite Rating.
"
223,CTSH,"At the time of the purchase, TriZetto software managed the health benefits of close to half the insured population of the U.S. and supported about a quarter of all U.S. care providers with more than 350 health plans.
"
224,CTSH,"TriZetto broadened the offerings of Cognizant's already fast-growing health-care segment, which provides health insurers, drug companies, biotech and other health-related businesses with services that address regulatory requirements, including compliance with the Affordable Care Act. At the time of the buy, Cognizant's health-care segment served more than 200 clients and accounted for about 26% of sales.
"
225,CTSH,"New Software Platforms
"
226,CTSH,"""TriZetto further strengthened our position in health care,"" Coburn told IBD. ""TriZetto is the leading platform in health care administration.
"
227,CTSH,"""Most important, TriZetto brought us (software) platforms (complementing) technology and business process services"" that Cognizant already offered.
"
228,CTSH,"Coburn says that with TriZetto in the mix, Cognizant is expanding from being a services provider to a combination of providing both services and platform products.
"
229,CTSH,"""That's a key component of our growth for the future in the health-care industry as well as other industries,"" he said, adding that Cognizant's strategy is to ""buy, build and partner,"" using those platforms across various industries.
"
230,CTSH,"He says there will be ""similar (growth) opportunities"" in financial services and pharmaceuticals due to ""changes in the regulatory environment, cost pressures and changing industry dynamics.""
"
231,CTSH,"The financial services segment is Cognizant's biggest business, accounting for 41.8% of revenue in 2014. Its manufacturing, retail and logistics segment accounted for 20.4% of 2014 revenue.
"
232,CTSH,"An IBD Leaderboard stock, Cognizant has been on a long-running winning streak with 16 straight quarters of double-digit sales and earnings growth.
"
233,CTSH,"In the second quarter, adjusted earnings rose 20% to 79 cents a share, ahead of views. Revenue climbed 23% to $3.09 billion, also topping forecasts. Cognizant also raised its full-year 2015 earnings and revenue estimates for the second time this year.

234,CTSH,"Cognizant's stock rose 6.4% on Aug. 5, the day it reported second-quarter results. Its stock continues to hover near its all-time closing high of 68.44.
"
235,CTSH,"""This is a company where revenue growth is by far the main driver of its valuation,"" said Robert Baird's David Koning. Year-to-year ""revenue growth in Q2 was the strongest in almost two years in both reported and organic and constant currency revenue.""
"
236,CTSH,"Koning says the ""backdrop"" to support strong revenue growth is Cognizant's ""good execution and willingness to invest in growth along with an industry backdrop that's still in a secular growth mode.""
"
237,CTSH,"The industry's growth mode, he says, is being driven by companies' willingness to spend on offshore IT and certain vertical segments having ""solid underlying growth.""
"
238,CTSH,"The health care segment was the quarter's fastest grower, with a 39% rise in revenue.
"
239,CTSH,"TriZetto contributed about $171.1 million in sales and was one of the ""drivers"" of the big gain, said CEO Francisco D'Souza on the quarter's conference call.
"
240,CTSH,"Koning calculates that the offshore IT services industry has grown organic revenue on a constant currency basis about 10%-13% annually over the past few years, while Cognizant has grown around the mid-teens to 20%.
"
241,CTSH,"How has Cognizant kept up such a fast pace?
"
242,CTSH,"""When we went public in 1998, we made the decision to keep margins at between 19% and 20%, which was lower than many of our competitors at the time, and use that money to invest for the long term and deliver industry leading revenue growth,"" Coburn said. ""We've continued to successfully execute on this strategy ever since.""
"
243,CTSH,"He says Cognizant has invested in having ""strong global delivery capabilities combined with deep industry knowledge and strong client relationships.""
"
244,CTSH,"He added: ""Our customers today have a dual mandate. They have to run their businesses better by becoming more efficient and effective. And they have to run their businesses different through digital (transformation) and how they interact with customers, employers and the supply chain. They do this by taking the money they've freed up from running better and investing it in running different.""

"
248,CTSH,"""We've experienced explosive growth in this area,"" he said.
"
249,CTSH,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Cognizant's earnings to grow by 17% in 2015 to $3.03 a share. They see a 15% increase in 2016 and a 16% gain in 2017.
"
250,CTSH,"""The combination of all the changes related to the Affordable Care Act and the aging of the population creates a nice backdrop for growth in Cognizant's health-care segment, which represents about 30% of the company's revenue,"" said Koning.

Had the economic recovery since 2009 been merely average, U.S. GDP would be bigger to the tune of $16,000 per household.Yet despite the sluggish economy, some big-cap companies are showing acceleration in earnings and revenue.The Big Cap 20 features several companies that are stepping up growth.Starbucks (SBUX) grew quarterly earnings on a year-earlier basis by 14%, 18% and most recently 24%.

Among roughly four dozen restaurants trading above $12 a share, only one besides Starbucks shows a similar achievement on the top and bottom lines. (It's DineEquity (DIN), a small cap.)Starbucks broke out in January and is now more than 30% above its original buy point. The stock has climbed steadily, pausing to brush just above the 50-day line in April. Starbucks recently pulled off its high and could be approaching a second brush with the 50-day line.If that develops along with a bounce off the line, that would constitute a secondary buy range.The Retail-Restaurants stock group was a respectable No. 48 among 197 industry groups in six-month price performance in Monday's IBD.Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) stepped up quarterly earnings from 12% to 14%, 15% and 20%. Revenue expanded 12%, 16%, 20% and 23% in the same quarters.The company provides technology outsourcing services.Cognizant broke out Wednesday. The 5% buy zone runs to 69.36. The RS line — which measures relative price strength vs. the S&P 500 — is at a 52-week high.The Computer-Tech Services stock group was No. 38 in Monday's IBD.Of stocks trading above 12, Cognizant is the only stock in its group delivering accelerated growth on the top and bottom lines.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) pumped up earnings growth from 1% to 8%, 22% and 23% in recent quarters. Revenue grew 6%, 7%, 36% and 48% in the same period.The stock broke out in July and remains in its 5% buy zone. The buy zone runs to 98.20.The Retail-Drug Stores stock group was No. 49 in Monday's IBD.Walgreens Boots is the only stock in its five-stock group that stepped up growth on both the top and bottom lines.Looking for acceleration among Big Cap 20 stocks isn't a bad place to begin a search for buy or watch-list candidates.Going into the start of Monday's session, the Big Cap 20 was outperforming the major stock market indexes this year. The Big Cap 20 was up 8% vs. 6% for the Nasdaq, 1% for the S&P 500 and 0% for the small-cap Russell 2000.

253,CTSH,"India's rupee, which has staged an 18-month advance vs. the dollar, dropped hard this week after China let its yuan adjust to market pressures beginning on Tuesday.By Thursday, the rupee slipped about 2% for the week, etching its lowest mark vs. the dollar since September 2013.Although the general view appears to be that a pullback in the currency could be good for India's economy, the Bombay Exchange's Sensex Index slipped 2.4% this week as Indian stocks rode alongside retreating global markets.On IBD's Top 10 World Stocks list, HDFC Bank (HDB) finished roughly flat in light trade Thursday.HDFC's annual revenue is smaller than peer Icici Bank (IBN) but, gauged by market value, it is India's largest lender.HDFC's stock briefly cleared a 64.07 flat base buy point July 20, then faltered.It fell more than 6% below that buy mark, but held above its key 50-day moving average.The stock dipped to near that support line again Tuesday and early Wednesday before rebounding in moderate trade.With the market uptrend under pressure, buying on such a rebound carries a fair amount of risk. Waiting to see whether shares will retake the buy point in strong trade is the least risky course of action.Icici Bank is down sharply this week as it struggles to hold its 10-week moving average. Shares are in a seven-month correction.On the IBD 50 list, Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) traded up a fraction on Thursday, holding mildly above a 66.06 flat-base buy point. The IT service provider is headquartered in New Jersey, but the majority of its employees and operations are located in India, primarily in Chennai on the southeast coast.The stock is working on its fifth straight weekly gain. Also in the IT sphere is Infosys (INFY), which rallied Thursday to a four-month high. The gain was enough to clear an 18 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. The breakout came in weak trade.At the other end of the scale, automaker Tata Motors (TTM) is down 10% for the week, hurt by fear that China's currency moves signaled deeper weakness in the top market for Tata's Jaguar and Land Rover nameplates. The loss put shares 48% below their February high of 51.80 and well below critical levels of support.

257,CTSH,"Epam Systems (EPAM) might not be the best known stock in its industry group — not when that group includes tech heavyweights IBM (IBM), Accenture (ACN), Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) and Infosys (INFY) — but the provider of outsourced software engineering and other IT services takes a back seat to no one when it comes to consistently strong financial growth.With seven straight quarters of double-digit earnings and revenue gains, Epam has put in one of the best recent financial performances of any stock in IBD's Computer-Technology Services group.The company's 98 Composite Rating places it No. 2 in the group behind Cognizant, which boasts a 99 rating. Epam's stock is still trading near the all-time high of 75.89 it established on July 13. Epam stock closed Friday at 74.11, up 55% since the beginning of the year.Epam is expected to continue its double-digit growth streak when it reports second-quarter earnings after the close on Tuesday.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see Q2 earnings of 65 cents a share, up from 53 cents the prior year. Revenue is expected to rise 23% to $215.6 million.The strong growth numbers come despite some pretty significant headwinds for Epam.More than half of its business comes from outside the U.S., which means the strong U.S. dollar acts as a drag. In addition, the company does a lot of business in Ukraine, where political tensions with Russia are high. Meanwhile, it must also deal with rising inflation in the Commonwealth of Independent States, which includes Ukraine .

303,CTSH,"A 70% Plunge
"
304,CTSH,"As taught in IBD's beginning-level live workshops, the average decline of a former big market winner from its ultimate peak price is 72%. In other words, a stock that tops out at 60 has the potential to bottom out near 17.
"
305,CTSH,"It's tough for any stock to dig itself out of that kind of hole.
"
306,CTSH,"Yet that's exactly what Cognizant did after the 2008-09 bear market ended.
"
307,CTSH,"The global player in information technology services fell 70% from its peak in February 2007 to a low of 7.19 (adjusted for splits) by November 2008. It looked like the stock's long run was over.
"
308,CTSH,"No it wasn't. Cognizant rebounded after the market's follow-through rally on March 12, 2009.
"
309,CTSH,"In July that year, the stock cleared a properly formed flat base near its 52-week high and eventually took out its 2007 peak. The stock corrected again from 2011 to the summer of 2013, then broke out again at 38.14 in the week ended Sept. 6, 2013. Another long digestion of gains led to a fresh breakout past a new 51.48 buy point last year.
"
310,CTSH,"Why did Cognizant come back strong? Steady earnings growth (from 95 cents a share in 2009 to $2.60 in 2014) is a big factor.
"
311,CTSH,"While revenue growth is nowhere close to its days of 50% to 60% increases in 2006-07, it's still in the double-digit range.
"
312,CTSH,"Those are impressive fundamentals for a company that broke the $10 billion revenue barrier last year.
"
313,CTSH,"Gilead had a monster run in the 2000s before peaking in August 2008. It then fell 45% from that peak. A large drop, surely, but nowhere near the typical 72% correction. New products, including its blockbuster drugs for Hepatitis C, have brought the institutional crowd back to the stock.

315,CTSH,"Tyler Technologies, which bills itself as America's largest provider of information management software and services to local governments, continues to bolster its position with an expanding portfolio of products to meet what it views as reliable demand from the public sector.
"
316,CTSH,"The Plano, Texas, firm's client base of over 13,000 local government offices spans all 50 states, as well as Canada, the Caribbean and the United Kingdom.
"
317,CTSH,"Following the 2007-08 financial crisis and the recession that accompanied it, local governments grappled with tax revenue shortfalls and budget struggles, forcing many to put off investments in new technology. In turn, Tyler (TYL) saw its growth curbed in 2010 and 2011.
"
318,CTSH,"As this happened, aging software and management systems — many of which dated to the late 1990s when governments last made upgrades en masse ahead of Y2K — grew outdated.
"
319,CTSH,"Once the economic recovery took hold, analysts say, rejuvenated local governments moved with haste to address pent-up demand for new technology, bolstering Tyler's fortunes.
"
320,CTSH,"Meeting Demand
"
321,CTSH,"Tyler Chief Financial Officer Brian Miller says the market has settled into a new normal now, one defined by solid demand from a broad customer base. The replacement cycle, coupled with increasing needs for advanced technology and Tyler's ability to sell more of its services to existing customers, creates a long runway for ongoing sales growth, he said in an interview.
"
322,CTSH,"""It's a very steady market with strong long-term opportunities,"" Miller said.
"
323,CTSH,"The company has generated double-digit gains in revenue for 14 straight quarters. Most recently, for the first quarter, it reported revenue of $135 million, up 20% from a year earlier. It posted net income of 59 cents per diluted share, an increase of 38%.
"
324,CTSH,"For Tyler's second-quarter report on July 22 after the stock market close, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect EPS of 61 cents, up 17%, on revenue of $142 million.
"
325,CTSH,"For the full year, Tyler has guided for revenue of $568 million to $575 million, with EPS of $2.46 to $2.54.
"
326,CTSH,"The analyst consensus is for a little under $574 million in revenue and $2.52 EPS.
"
327,CTSH,"Tyler is a part of IBD's Computer-Tech Services industry group. The biggest names in the group by market cap are IBM (IBM), Accenture (ACN) and Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH), but Tyler is highest-ranked by Composite Rating, with a 98 out of a possible 99 from IBD.
"
328,CTSH,"Tyler's managerial offerings include enterprise resource planning (ERP) for cities, counties and schools — everything from electronic records management to payroll processing — as well as software and systems that automate property assessments.
"
329,CTSH,"Revved Up In The Downturn
"
330,CTSH,"Miller says the company invested in research and development in the aftermath of the recession, pushing for innovation when most competitors pulled back on that front.
"
331,CTSH,"It has developed faster, more comprehensive and easier-to-integrate systems that are of increasing appeal to local governments that need to replace systems and want to do so with technology that can make them more efficient.
"
332,CTSH,"Miller says that as Tyler invested in R&D, many of its smaller competitors who ""went the opposite direction"" have since lost relevancy.
"
333,CTSH,"Miller adds that two-thirds of the local government ERP systems needing to be replaced in the near future were bought from companies that no longer compete with Tyler — creating fertile ground for new business.
"
334,CTSH,"Another big advantage for Tyler, analysts say, is that it operates in multiple areas of the local government arena, while smaller players tend to be less diverse.
"
335,CTSH,"This lets Tyler provide more comprehensive services at competitive rates and sell more of its offerings to each customer.
"
336,CTSH,"""They've really become the standout,"" Benchmark Co. analyst Mark Schappel told IBD, adding that smaller competitors are ""less and less meaningful. Tyler is in the driver's seat.""
"
337,CTSH,"Miller also credits Tyler's ""evergreen"" program for its software.
"
338,CTSH,"Under a systems support or subscription agreement with a customer, he says, the client pays small annual maintenance costs, as opposed to dealing with large periodic licensing fees, and in exchange gets regular software updates to stay current.
"
339,CTSH,"Tyler this year introduced a companion offering, its EverGuide initiative for services and consulting. This should further boost customers' ""upsell likelihood,"" William Blair analyst Jonathan Ho said in a research report.
"
340,CTSH,"Tyler competes with industry stalwarts such as SAP (SAP) and Oracle (ORCL). Miller says that Tyler often wins business over its larger rivals because customers appreciate its focus solely on the public sector —local governments in particular.
"
341,CTSH,"The Tyler staffers responsible for integrating new technology for customers ""know that business backward and forward,"" he said.
"
342,CTSH,"Winning Contracts
"
343,CTSH,"Miller says that Tyler has been consistently posting overall win rates of 60% or better — meaning it beats out the competition at least 60% of the time on the business it goes after — and that is 10% better than prior to the recession. Tyler is generating even higher win rates in certain businesses.
"
344,CTSH,"The company's courts-and-justice operation is a key example of this, Miller says. Its software helps administrators manage jails, aids police and prosecutors in tracking cases, and connects the three entities to provide efficient case management and records updates.
"
345,CTSH,"Tyler's Odyssey court-case management system, an electronic filing service, processes fines and generates court documents among other tasks, reducing staffing hours and paper costs for local governments, the company says.
"
346,CTSH,"Tyler's win rate is ""north of 85%"" in the courts-and-justice business, Miller said. ""We are winning virtually every meaningful deal in that space.""
"
347,CTSH,"Business has been particularly robust in California. Miller notes that a drawn-out effort to develop a statewide court system there was ultimately scrapped two years ago.
"
348,CTSH,"It left counties, which had put their own systems in limbo in anticipation of moving under a state umbrella, to hastily pursue upgrades.
"
349,CTSH,"""That created an accelerated demand,"" he said. ""A lot of the counties had very urgent needs to replace systems.""
"
350,CTSH,"Courting California
"
351,CTSH,"Of 58 counties in California, 28 have bought new systems, and Tyler has won 25 of those deals, Miller says. ""I think we've won the last 18 in a row. We clearly have been very, very successful in that marketplace,"" he said.
"
352,CTSH,"Its clients range from the smallest counties all the way up to the largest, Los Angeles County.
"
353,CTSH,"The L.A. County contract was valued at $32 million, Miller says.
"
354,CTSH,"""In our view,"" analyst Ho wrote, ""the courts-and-justice business continues to be a source of significant opportunity for the company.""
"
355,CTSH,"Tyler's growth plans could include acquisitions, Miller says, adding that the company is ""very disciplined"" on pricing. With no debt on its balance sheet and strong cash flow, he says, it has its eyes open for attractive opportunities.
"
356,CTSH,"He points to its acquisition of Brazos Technology in May as a good example. Brazos makes handheld electronic devices for police officers to record traffic tickets and accident information. Brazos had generated annual revenue under $10 million. But by pairing its devices with Tyler's broader offerings and larger client base, Miller says, Tyler can boost those sales.
"
357,CTSH,"He adds that Tyler in recent years has sought out targets of Brazos' size, largely to fill gaps in its service, and has the wherewithal to do larger deals too. That said, Tyler is so confident in its organic growth prospects that it feels no pressure to move urgently on the deal front.

359,CTSH,"Several names in IBD's Computer-Technology Services industry group have been hot. Mutual funds have been key drivers. Hackett Group (HCKT), up 35% so far this year, was held by 196 funds as of March 31 — up from 186 as of Dec. 31.

361,CTSH,"Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH), up 23% this year, saw the $112.5 billion Fidelity Contrafund start a new position as of its latest disclosure. And the $2.7 billion Franklin DynaTech added to its stake in CDK Global (CDK), which is up 27% this year.
"
362,CTSH,"But the overall industry group is currently ranked No. 40 among 197 — down from No. 29 four weeks ago.
"
363,CTSH,"What gives? Several names may be catching their breath after such a sharp run-up, analysts say.
"
364,CTSH,"Yet certain individual names still have strong fundamentals. Firms in this group stand to benefit — and benefit investors — from the ongoing loosening of corporate spending on their services, says Morris Ajzenman, analyst for Griffin Securities.
"
365,CTSH,"Thinly traded Hackett Group has been driven by exploitation of its business benchmarking and best-practices database.
"
366,CTSH,"""This database collects thousands of data points from a couple thousand major corporations worldwide,"" Ajzenman said. ""Customers can go in and see how they stack up against the top decile or quartile.""
"
367,CTSH,"Hackett has built sales by pulling in new customers, Ajzenman says.
"
368,CTSH,"It is also exploring partnerships with various companies to create new products based on its database, he says. One under discussion would be aimed at the 5 million accountants in the U.S.

372,CTSH,"Tyler Technologies (TYL) is up 10% this year after pulling back 10% from its April 27 high of 133.54. Also thinly traded, the stock is below its 10-week moving average and working on a late-stage flat base.
"
373,CTSH,"The company makes software systems for local governments.
"
374,CTSH,"That focus helps keep the firm largely out of direct competition with big software makers, which focus on doing business with state governments and large counties.
"
375,CTSH,"Many of Tyler's products handle various aspects of financial accounting. But one of Tyler's growing lines is in the courts-and-justice market, installing online-compatible digital records-filing systems, says Mark Schappel, head of equity research for Benchmark.

376,CTSH,"Tyler has the advantages of being an early vendor in courts and justice. It won the job of converting Texas courts to e-filing, Schappel says. It still has little competition in this market nationwide.

Shares have traded tight since and remain in buy range past the 66.76 buy point.The giant drugmaker reported accelerating earnings and sales in the most recent quarter.Managed health care provider Cigna is still in buy range past a 135.10 flat-base buy point it cleared in heavy trade on May 22.Analog Devices is pulling back after a heavy volume breakout on May 20. Shares are still in buy range, but like many chip stocks, early breakout gains are in danger of disappearing. On the other hand, stocks like Nike (NKE), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) and CarMax (KMX) have all slipped below recent buy points.There are no sell signals so far.Nike is testing support at its 10-week line below a 103.89 buy point. The latest pattern is part of a base-on-base that stretches back to November.Nike is expected to report 6% profit growth when it releases fiscal fourth-quarter results, which ended in May. Sales are expected to climb 3% to $7.67 billion.CarMax broke out from a cup-with-handle base on Friday in light trade, but turned lower Monday. Shares remain just below a 73.30 buy point.CarMax will report fiscal Q1 results on June 19 before the market open. Analysts are looking for earnings to climb 13% to 86 cents a share on 11% revenue growth.It would be the used car dealer's fifth straight quarter of double-digit earnings and sales growth.After some decent initial progress, Skyworks Solutions has returned below a 102.87 flat-base buy point. Volume has been mostly light as the stock pulled back, which is a positive sign. Watch to see if the long-time leader can find support near the breakout price and the 10-week moving average.On the plus side, Regeneron (REGN) is acting well after a low-volume breakout in May. The base was late stage, but shares have gained as much as 12% from the 486.10 buy point and remain extended out of buy range.Stocks still basing include Salesforce.com (CRM), Facebook (FB), Gilead (GILD) and Illumina (ILMN).

"
458,CTSH,"It made four buys in 2014. The biggest came last January when it paid $109.8 million in a cash and stock deal for the Web presence business of Directi from Directi Web Technologies. Directi provides Web presence solutions to small and medium-size businesses in various countries, including India, the U.S., Turkey, China, Russia and Indonesia.
"
459,CTSH,"And look for more buys: ""Investing in mergers and acquisitions is a very accretive use of free cash flow and going forward we'll continue to do so,"" Blake Cunneen, Endurance's senior vice president of corporate development, told IBD. ""We don't have any deals we're announcing. But we told the Street to expect M&A growth to continue.""
"
460,CTSH,"Endurance capped 2014 with healthy results. Cunneen says ""we saw continued growth and strength in two core metrics: net subscriber growth and growth in average revenue per subscriber.""
"
461,CTSH,"Total subscribers increased by 91,000 in the fourth quarter. Average monthly revenue per subscriber rose 12% year over year to $14.78. For all of 2014, the number of subscribers rose 17% to 4.087 million and the average monthly revenue per subscriber increased 11% to $14.48.

""There are a lot of vendors in the space and the barriers to entry are not high. But the ability to run a business of this nature at scale and do it very profitably is another matter entirely, and that's one thing they've excelled at.
"
468,CTSH,"""The company has been able to continue to leverage very large data sets of user behavior to improve cross-selling and conversion rates. That's resulted in them amassing a stronger competitive position over the past five to 10 years.""

"
470,CTSH,"Among Endurance's competitors is Web-hosting provider and recent hot IPO GoDaddy (GDDY), which went public on April 1.
"

"
472,CTSH,"""When you think about business today, having a strong Web presence is pretty fundamental to having a successful business,"" he said. ""Our core offering is so inherent to small business needs. Where we differentiate ourselves is in providing great customer support. One thing that helps drive word-of-mouth referrals is providing a great user experience to our customers.""

Other highly-rated members of the group include Tyler Technologies (TYL) and Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH).Buoyed by recent buys and a steady stream of new offerings, Endurance International Group is building muscle in the cloud-based services arena as it continues to strike a chord with the growing number of small and midsize businesses looking to rev up their online presence.Endurance International (EIGI) provides cloud-based solutions to help small and midsize companies market and grow their businesses on the Web. The company, which went public in October 2013, boasts a suite of over 150 products and services.The far-flung offerings available on its platform include domains, website builders, Web hosting, email, security, storage, social media services, mobile device tools and productivity, and e-commerce solutions. Its family of brands include Bluehost, HostGator, iPage, Domain.com, A Small Orange, and ResellerClub, among others.Endurance holds a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99.Business BoostersThe company has been revving up its business through a number of initiatives, including acquisitions and new product offerings.It made four buys in 2014. The biggest came last January when it paid $109.8 million in a cash and stock deal for the Web presence business of Directi from Directi Web Technologies. Directi provides Web presence solutions to small and medium-size businesses in various countries, including India, the U.S., Turkey, China, Russia and Indonesia.And look for more buys: ""Investing in mergers and acquisitions is a very accretive use of free cash flow and going forward we'll continue to do so,"" Blake Cunneen, Endurance's senior vice president of corporate development, told IBD. ""We don't have any deals we're announcing. But we told the Street to expect M&A growth to continue.""Endurance capped 2014 with healthy results. Cunneen says ""we saw continued growth and strength in two core metrics: net subscriber growth and growth in average revenue per subscriber.""Total subscribers increased by 91,000 in the fourth quarter. Average monthly revenue per subscriber rose 12% year over year to $14.78. For all of 2014, the number of subscribers rose 17% to 4.087 million and the average monthly revenue per subscriber increased 11% to $14.48.F ourth quarter adjusted net income, which excludes certain items, soared 88% to 30 cents a share from 16 cents a year earlier.Adjusted revenue rose 28% to $175.2 million.Adjusted EBITDA surged 34% to $62 million. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as adjusted net income plus interest expense, depreciation, and income tax expense (benefit) and certain other exclusions.Including items, the company reported a $2.2 million net loss for the fourth quarter, compared with a net loss of $67.5 million a year earlier.Endurance guided to growth between 14% and 16% in adjusted revenue for 2015 and between 17% and 21% in adjusted EBITDA.""We like the company and think it is a very well run business without much in the way of direct competition,"" Cowen analyst Gregg Moskowitz told IBD. ""There are a lot of vendors in the space and the barriers to entry are not high. But the ability to run a business of this nature at scale and do it very profitably is another matter entirely, and that's one thing they've excelled at.""The company has been able to continue to leverage very large data sets of user behavior to improve cross-selling and conversion rates. That's resulted in them amassing a stronger competitive position over the past five to 10 years.""Services EmphasizedAmong Endurance's competitors is Web-hosting provider and recent hot IPO GoDaddy (GDDY), which went public on April 1.A key driver of Endurance's growth is the growing demand for its services, says Cunneen.""When you think about business today, having a strong Web presence is pretty fundamental to having a successful business,"" he said. ""Our core offering is so inherent to small business needs. Where we differentiate ourselves is in providing great customer support. One thing that helps drive word-of-mouth referrals is providing a great user experience to our customers.""Endurance services its customers with access to 24/7 support. It tries to be ""responsive"" in how it talks to customers, he adds, by trying to understand their businesses and identifying ways to help them grow.Endurance customers sign up for a standard Web-presence package, which includes all the basic tools they need to manage and build a Web presence, such as hosting, site-builder tools, and domain name registration.From there, Endurance is able to boost revenue per subscriber by enhancing that presence with more products, such as site backup, and scanning and marketing tools to help a site get found, Cunneen says.""Throughout 2014 the amount of subscriber acquisitions was very strong and the company was able in a pretty steady fashion to see (increases in) average monthly revenue per subscriber,"" said Moskowitz, who has an outperform rating on the company.In the fourth quarter, it got ""an additional benefit"" from three recent acquisitions, Moskowitz adds.Last August it acquired Webzai, which provides a simple-to-use website builder and mobile-website-builder product.

736,CTSH,"You've got to respect and understand the classics.In books, there's ""The Great Gatsby."" In the realm of American food, you've got the burger and fries. And when it comes to chart reading, the most classic pattern is the cup with handle.For decades now, investors who know how to spot this pattern have been reaping profits.The best way to become more familiar with any stock chart pattern is by looking at examples. So it's worth studying the cup-with-handle base that Cognizant Technology (CTSH) formed in 2004.The left side of the pattern began to take shape in January 2004, as Cognizant embarked on what ended up becoming a seven-week losing streak. (1) It wasn't until June that Cognizant began etching the right side of its base.In general, a cup-with-handle structure should be at least seven weeks long. But it could also form over the course of a year, or an even longer period of time.The correction within the cup typically should not exceed 35%, and Cognizant fit the bill as it corrected 31%.The handle part of the base represents one last shakeout of weak shareholders before the stock moves to new highs. You generally want to see calm action and just a mild correction within the handle.A good handle will correct only 8% to 12% or less. You might see a slide of up to 15%, but anything beyond that definitely is not ideal. In Cognizant's case, the handle — which began to develop in July — featured a correction of 14%. (2)A handle also should be at least a week or five trading days in length, although they can be longer. Cognizant took about four weeks to sketch its handle.With any breakout from a base, you want to see strong turnover as the stock moves out of the consolidation. Cognizant certainly delivered convincing volume as it broke out past a 26.74 entry in late July 2004 in big volume. (3)However, with the market in poor shape, Cognizant fell more than 8% from that buy point. Investors had to sell and cut losses.The market returned to a confirmed uptrend Aug. 18. The stock rallied again and cleared the 26.74 buy point for good. It also formed a tighter two-week handle in September, offering a new chance to add shares.Some chartists might think Cognizant's pattern also resembled a double-bottom base. But the middle peak in April was a bit low.

737,CTSH,"In the 16 years that Gordon Coburn has worked at Cognizant Technology Solutions, the firm has ballooned from about 1,000 employees to more than 145,000. To manage such explosive growth, Coburn and his team seek to preserve organizational culture.
"
738,CTSH,"For Coburn, president of Teaneck, N.J.-based Cognizant (CTSH), the key to protecting the information technology consulting firm's culture is creating an environment where employees can apply themselves fully and succeed. That means articulating a vision and then getting out of their way.
"
739,CTSH,"""We empower people to run their piece of the business and make sure they have the tools they need,"" said Coburn, 48. ""Otherwise, you become a bottleneck. To get and keep good people, you can't micromanage them.""

741,CTSH,"Tapping Internal Know-How
"
742,CTSH,"Coburn's appreciation of the value of empowerment set in early in his Cognizant career. As head count grew, he realized he no longer knew everyone's name within the firm — and that he had to step back so they could step up.
"
743,CTSH,"Giving employees the space to succeed is especially important today. In 2011, Cognizant hired an average of 20 people every business hour during the year, Coburn says. Establishing what he calls the ""tone from the top,"" characterized by transparency and clear communication, has enabled the company to grow so fast without losing its identity.
"
744,CTSH,"To harness its expanding brain trust, the company launched ""Cognizant 2.0"" around five years ago — a global collaborative platform for employees to share knowledge. Through this online tool, staffers can connect with internal experts and discuss learning experiences with customers.
"
745,CTSH,"Thanks to this repository of internal knowledge, employees preserve institutional memory and best practices. They can answer each other's questions and read case studies and white papers.
"
746,CTSH,"""We want it to be process-dependent, not people-dependent,"" Coburn explained. ""We want the process to be replicated so that it's not dependent on a particular individual. So we document with care what's done and why it's done.""
"
747,CTSH,"If a customer faces a recurring problem with an application, for example, the Cognizant employee who fixes it the first time will describe the steps he or she took — entering the solution into Cognizant 2.0 — so that other workers can follow the same process in the future.
"
748,CTSH,"Because a majority of Cognizant's workforce is under age 30, they are adept users of social media. Cognizant 2.0 appeals to younger employees in part because it involves crowdsourcing and other online social networking activities.

752,CTSH,"Francisco D'Souza is used to surfing the big waves of change.He was born in Nairobi, Kenya; grew up in 10 other countries, including Panama and Congo; and had to learn languages just to survive in school.During the boom of the late 1990s, he helped launch the tech service firm Cognizant (CTSH), was its North American director through the tech crash of the early 2000s and became CEO in January 2007.Despite the recession that started late that year, D'Souza has overseen revenue growth from $1.4 billion to 2012's $7.4 billion while providing everything from software system integration to high-tech strategic consulting.Arvind Ramnani of BNP Paribas predicts that Cognizant's revenue will bulge to $8.9 billion in 2013 and $10.3 billion in 2014.Meanwhile, Cognizant's stock has rocketed 525% since late 2008.""I think the key to success in the business world today is to learn how to adapt rapidly,"" D'Souza, 45, told IBD.D'Souza is the son of an Indian diplomat, which meant the family moved to a different country every few years. His parents put their children in native schools instead of the international ones, favored by many foreigners, that minimized contact with the locals.Worldly""We learned to thrive in a flat world long before the term became in vogue,"" said D'Souza. ""My multicultural experience had a decisive impact on the way we consciously built Cognizant to serve a global marketplace.""His father bought him a computer when he was 13.Frank taught himself programming and in three years developed software to manage the inventory of a division of the Trinidad army.At 18 he worked as a teller in an international bank in Hong Kong during the day and went to the University of East Asia in Macau at night. The bank was using a punch-card system that was no longer supported by the vendor, so he helped implement a software program.A year later he worked with a small startup to invent a mass fax machine that could send out advertising for products and daily stock quotes, in the process learning the basics of entrepreneurship.After earning a bachelor's degree in business in 1991, D'Souza entered the MBA program at Pittsburgh's Carnegie Mellon University. He had to take a job on campus to pay the bills, so he pulled all-nighters before tests and took power naps between classes.He dreamed of starting a tech company, but had no green card to let him stay in America as an entrepreneur. After graduation in 1992, he joined credit information provider Dun & Bradstreet (DNB) and went to Germany. The next year, he heard D&B wanted to focus on emerging markets, so he volunteered to help create a software service arm in Chennai, India.Originally called DBSS and servicing D&B's in-house needs, the unit was spun off as Cognizant in 1996 and the next year moved to Teaneck, N.J. It went public in 1998.Meanwhile, D'Souza got his green card, and from 1997 to 2003 he directed North American operations and business development, getting through the dot-com bust by doing information technology projects that bigger firms ignored.""One day, I might be out selling to prospective clients; the next, I could be figuring out how to process our payroll,"" he said.D'Souza's lesson is that marketing experience can be a great plus to help reach your career goals, no matter what they are. He served as chief operating officer from December 2003 to December 2006 before becoming CEO at 38.Cognizant rolled onto Fortune's ""100 Fastest-Growing Companies"" list from 2003 to 2012 and became one of the Fortune 500 in 2011.While it has big-name allies such as Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL) and SAS, Cognizant faces competition from giants such as IBM (IBM), Accenture (ACN) and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ).Cognizant does general business and management consulting, which can range from business process re-engineering to mergers-and-acquisitions program management. Its sweet spot is to address points where technology and operations intersect, such as integrating complex systems and implementing new applications.Cognizant operates in over 40 countries, but D'Souza cautions that keeping costs low for clients should not be the sole value when it comes to outsourcing.""Clients today need to address a dual mandate — driving costs down in their core business, while simultaneously innovating and transforming their business by leveraging the new SMAC stack,"" D'Souza said, referring to social mobility, data analytics and cloud service. ""With structural shifts in economy, business and technology, enterprises are forced to re-examine how they operate, moving from merely incremental levels of performance efficiency to building new digital business capabilities. In this context, not only do they need to run better; they need to run different.""GrowthCognizant has convinced so many C-level executives that it can do a superior job at reasonable prices while driving their innovation agenda that its client list has grown from 400 to 1,100 under D'Souza.His firm currently has more than 166,000 employees globally.""It has also doubled revenue per client over the past five years,"" wrote Ramnani. ""The trend is reflective of the value that Cognizant provides to its clients in an environment where they were consolidating their vendor relationships.""Cognizant's inroads into some industries are nothing short of stunning. Its customers include 27 of the top 30 global pharmaceutical companies, nine of the 10 leading biotechs, 12 of the biggest medical device makers, four of five online powerhouses, as well as six of the top 10 North American financial institutions and all top 10 in Europe.Part of the company's formula for gaining loyalty is deep experience with its Two-in-a-Box approach. One part of the team is a Cognizant business expert who has over 15 years' experience in that industry and works at the client's site. That specialist works with an IT specialist who has the same level of experience implementing projects.When the recession hit in late 2007, D'Souza decided to invest in growth. Meanwhile, rivals were cutting back.D'Souza told everyone at Cognizant to spend more time with customers and more effort in marketing to potential ones. Over the next few years, he traveled to meet many of them, showing that the company was committed top to bottom to making itself invaluable.Differentiating itself from tech outsourcing companies, Cognizant acquired consultancies and emphasized its long-term strategic advisory relationships.All For OneIn February 2012, D'Souza made a radical decision. The company was reorganized under three leaders to leave him free from day-to-day operational management to concentrate on future technology.With $3.36 billion in cash and short-term investments and no debt, Cognizant is placing its bet on balancing its core revenue sources with a gamble on potential ones.Headed by President Gordon Coburn and group CEOs Rajeev Mehta and Chandrasekaran Ramakrishnan, Cognizant's services are divided into three horizons:• 1. The cash cow of application development, maintenance and testing, enterprise resource planning, data warehousing and business intelligence.• 2. Fast-growing management consulting, IT infrastructure management and business process.• 3. New technologies and markets such as Latin America.""D'Souza is risking both his own reputation and career,"" wrote Forbes India. ""But as Albert Einstein once said: Problems cannot be solved by the same level of thinking that created them.""D'Souza's lesson is that when things are going well, look for ways to break out to the next level.""I've seen CEOs who are strong in leadership or management, but Frank is truly rare in having such outsized capabilities in both,"" said Malcolm Frank, executive vice president and chief strategist at Cognizant. ""I've seen him build a galvanized sense of purpose across the entire company with a compelling long-term vision, then give us whiplash by immediately switching to work closely with a particular business unit, holding them to key metrics and deliverables in incredible detail.""

753,CTSH,"IT leader Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) flashed several sell signs earlier this year, as it cooled off following its big advance since 2009.
"
754,CTSH,"That's not to say that the tech outsourcer reached its ultimate top this year. It still might end up posting strong results and hitting new all-time highs.
"
755,CTSH,"But the stock certainly signaled that investors ought to at least consider locking in some profits following its impressive run.
"
756,CTSH,"The advance began with a breakout from a first-stage base in 2009.
"
757,CTSH,"Next, Cognizant cleared a second-stage, base-on-base pattern in the summer of 2010.
"
758,CTSH,"By late last year, it was working on a third-stage pattern, a five-week flat base 1. This wasn't a sell signal, but investors should have been on their toes at this point.
"
759,CTSH,"After all, a third-stage base is a later-stage structure. Big gains are more likely to come from breakouts from first- or second-stage bases.
"
760,CTSH,"Cognizant still managed to add to its gains after breaking out past a 68.97 buy point from its third-stage base in December 2010 2. But there were only a few months left in its run.

761,CTSH,"You might have considered selling the stock on April 1 or April 21 of this year 3. On each of those days, Cognizant hit a new all-time high in soft turnover (weekly chart is shown; please see a daily chart).
"
762,CTSH,"That can serve as a sell sign, especially given that the stock reached 83, up 20% beyond 68.97. Another IBD sell rule is to lock in gains once you have a 20%-to-25% profit.

763,CTSH,"Perhaps the most clear indication to sell at least some shares came in the week ended May 6.

769,CTSH,"The flat base has much in common with its cousin, the square-box base. But there are differences, and a little confusion could get you in trouble.
"
770,CTSH,"Be assured, both patterns can portend big advances. The theme they share is tight trading. And as you may have learned by now, tight is right when it comes to buying stocks.

"
774,CTSH,"The maximum range for the base must not exceed 15%.
"
775,CTSH,"The action within the flat base should be as sideways as possible. Volume should be low, as if the stock is setting up while nobody is paying any attention.
"
776,CTSH,"A breakout would appear when the stock moves to new highs. Like any breakout, a push from a flat base should be accompanied by a solid volume surge, at least 40% from its average pace of business.
"
777,CTSH,"The Square Box
"
778,CTSH,"Like the flat base, a square box must not stray more than 15%, from top to bottom. Sideways action is preferred to an upward or downward tilt. Volume should be quiet.
"
779,CTSH,"The big difference is the pattern's time span. Instead of five weeks, a square box needs just four. It can last up to seven weeks. This helps give the pattern a sharply angled, boxy look.
"
780,CTSH,"If you're looking at what you think is a flat base in the making, look closer.
"
781,CTSH,"Does the pattern look like your first apartment? It should look like, well, a square box. It may look as long as it is high.

800,CTSH,"Shares of Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report) have gained 37.7% over the past year, outperforming the 28.5% rally of the industry it belongs to.

801,CTSH,"Continuing with its strategy of growing through acquisitions, Accenture Plc (ACN  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has acquired VERAX Solutions – a consulting firm – which mainly focuses on the financial sector in Canada. Financial terms of the deal remain undisclosed.Founded in 2003, the privately-owned VERAX offers IT strategy, project and program management, enterprise architecture consulting, compliance and risk solutions, as well as business intelligence and data warehousing services to banking, insurance and capital markets companies based in Canada. The company currently has 180 employees and operates through its offices in Toronto and Halifax.By integrating VERAX, Accenture will not only get a large talent pool, but will also gain a huge customer base in Canada, thereby expanding its reach in different markets. We believe that this acquisition will fortify Accenture’s presence in the financial consulting market and help in gaining more market share as well.We are encouraged by Accenture’s strategy of growing through acquisitions. These buyouts have enabled the company to foray into newer markets, diversify and broaden the product portfolio, as along with maintaining a leading position. We believe that regular acquisitions will significantly prove conducive to its revenue growth.Notably, shares of Accenture have outperformed the industry to which it belongs to, in a year’s time. The stock has returned 12.7% compared with the industry’s gain of 12%.Nonetheless, Accenture’s latest announcement of creating 15K new jobs by 2020, and investment plan of $1.4 billion for employee training and opening of 10 innovation centers across the U.S. cities may dent its bottom-line results. Increasing competition from the likes of DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report), Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (CTSH  -  Free Report) and Navigant Consulting Inc. (NCI  -  Free Report), as well as an uncertain macroeconomic environment may deter the company’s growth to some extent.Currently, Accenture carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

802,CTSH,"On Aug 8, we issued an updated research report on Teaneck, NJ-based Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (CTSH  -  Free Report), a leading provider of information technology, consulting and business process outsourcing services.Cognizant’s shares have traded neck and neck with the industry on a year-to-date basis. This is primarily driven by solid earnings and top-line growth in the first half of 2017. Notably, the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimates in three out of trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 4.53%.Cognizant reported impressive earnings growth in the second quarter of 2017 that can be attributed to strong top-line, which is benefiting from significant exposure to the fast-growing verticals like Financial Services and Healthcare.Cognizant narrowed its top-line guidance for 2017, which reflects improved visibility. Moreover, the company raised its earnings guidance. We believe that the impressive results and the guidance indicate the company’s ability in harnessing the ongoing digital transition.Cognizant shares are up 25.4% as compared with industry’s return of 24.6%.Domain Expertise, Acquisitions Driving GrowthCognizant’s domain expertise is a key catalyst. The company is consistently developing its capabilities to benefit from the ongoing digital transition especially when it comes to integration of the new digital framework with legacy technology platforms. Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation Revenue (TTM) Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation Revenue (TTM) | Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation QuoteAdditionally, the company has gained deep industry expertise and knowledge of the fast-growing verticals, like Financial Services and Healthcare, through partnerships with top firms like Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report).

804,CTSH,"Accenture Plc (ACN  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has completed the acquisition of LabAnswer, a research and laboratory informatics technology consulting firm. Notably, the two companies had entered into the deal last month. However, financial details of the transaction remain undisclosed.Headquartered in Sugar Land, TX, LabAnswer is specialized in providing informatics consultancy services to scientific and research laboratories. With approximately 250 employees, apart from life sciences, the company offers its services to various other industries, including chemicals, resources, energy, consumer goods, and government.With the successful completion of the buyout, the company has established a new business division – Accenture Scientific Informatics Services.Accenture is planning to leverage its digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, automation, analytics and cloud, with a fundamental redesign of the scientific user experience. With this, the company’s new division will be able to help life sciences companies in better capturing, managing, integrating and analyzing complex research data, thereby giving better ideas to identify new and more effective treatments for patients.We believe that this acquisition will enhance Accenture’s portfolio of life sciences services. The acquisition of LabAnswer will not only bring in a huge talent pool, but will also expand its reach in different markets.We are encouraged by Accenture’s strategy of growing through acquisitions. These buyouts have enabled the company to foray into newer markets, diversify and broaden the product portfolio, as well as maintain a leading position. We believe that regular acquisitions will significantly contribute to its revenue stream.Notably, shares of Accenture have outperformed the industry, over the last one year. The stock has gained 13.9% compared with the industry’s gain of 13.2%.Nonetheless, Accenture’s latest announcement of creating 15K new jobs by 2020 and investment plan of $1.4 billion for employee training and opening of 10 innovation centers across the U.S. cities will likely dent its bottom-line results. Increasing competition from the likes of DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) and Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (CTSH  -  Free Report), as well as an uncertain macroeconomic environment may deter the company’s growth to some extent.Currently, Accenture carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the same industry is Exponent Inc. (EXPO  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

805,CTSH,"Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (CTSH  -  Free Report) surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 3.4%.With long-term earnings per share growth rate of 12.6% and a market cap of $46.8 billion, it seems to be a stock that should maintain a place in investors’ portfolio.Let’s take a detailed look at the factors that are impacting the company’s performance.Significant exposure to the fast-growing verticals like financial services and healthcare has boosted Cognizant’s growth. The company is consistently developing its capabilities for the integration of the new digital framework with legacy technology platforms.Additionally, transactions such as the TriZetto buyout and more recently, the acquisitions of Bolder Healthcare and Mirabeau are likely to benefit the company. Apart from gaining new customers from these buyouts, the company expanded its capabilities in the healthcare industry and improved overall digital delivery abilities.Cognizant is expected to continue benefiting from solid demand for high quality, lower cost technology services. Based on its global delivery model and capacity expansion in low cost areas in India, China, Philippines and Latin America, the company remains well-positioned in the outsourcing market.Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation Revenue (TTM) Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation Revenue (TTM) | Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation QuoteHowever, the company faces significant geographic concentration risks, with North America’s significant contribution to its revenues. Cognizant also earns nearly 40% of its revenues from the financial services industry. Therefore, any slowdown in the region’s economic environment or consolidation in the financial services industry is anticipated to have a negative impact on the company.Cognizant too faces stiff competition from the likes of Infosys Technologies (INFY  -  Free Report), Accenture (ACN  -  Free Report), Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro among others, which is an added concern.Furthermore, the company relates to the nature of its business, which necessitates bringing employees into the United States for on-site application maintenance work. With continuous pressure to avoid outsourcing and employment of foreign nationals, the U.S. government under President Donald Trump is mulling to reduce the number of H1-B visas granted each year. This, in turn, might negatively impact Cognizant’s performance.Nevertheless, the company’s foray into growth-oriented markets, strong domain expertise and ability to keep up with ongoing digital transformation justify the retention of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock in investors’ portfolio.Key PickA better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

809,CTSH,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Q2 Holdings (QTWO  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 8.5% over the past month. QTWO hit a new 52-week high of $52.25 in the previous session. Q2 Holdings has gained 35.4% since the start of the year compared to the 1.4% move for the Computer and Technology sector and the 7.7% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on February 14, 2018, Q2 Holdings reported EPS of $0.05 vs.the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.02 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0.02%.For the current fiscal year, Q2 Holdings is expected to post earnings of $0.16 per share on $235.09 million in revenues. This represents a 433.33% change in EPS on a 21.19% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $0.38 per share on $292.64 million in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 139.58% and 24.48%, respectively.Valuation MetricsQ2 Holdings may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for QTWO? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Q2 Holdings has a Value Score of F. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 316.3X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 713.9X versus its peer group's average of 24.8X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 15.81. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Q2 Holdings, Inc. Price and Consensus  Q2 Holdings, Inc. Price and Consensus | Q2 Holdings, Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Q2 Holdings currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Q2 Holdings meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though QTWO shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does Q2 Holdings Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Q2 Holdings have been moving higher, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks, including Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH  -  Free Report), CACI International (CACI  -  Free Report), and Baidu (BIDU  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.However, it is worth noting that the Zacks Industry Rank for this group is in the bottom half of the ranking, so it isn't all good news for Q2 Holdings. Still, the fundamentals for QTWO are promising, and it still has potential despite being at a 52-week high.

The Computer and Technology group currently sits at #5 within the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank includes 16 different groups and is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.The Zacks Rank is a successful stock-picking model that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions.

On average, this group has gained an average of 7.80% so far this year, meaning that CTSH is performing better in terms of year-to-date returns.CTSH will likely be looking to continue its solid performance, so investors interested Computer and Technology stocks should continue to pay close attention to the company.

811,CTSH,"Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report) is witnessing strong demand for its services owing to solid performance across its insurance, banking and health care segments.In the second-quarter fiscal 2018, the company performed exceedingly well. Non-GAAP earnings (excluding the effect of US tax law changes) of $1.58 per share, outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents and improved 18.8% year over year. Also, revenues increased 15% year over year to $9.6 billion and surpassed the consensus mark by 3.2%.Furthermore, the company’s surprise history has been impressive as it surpassed the consensus mark in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 3.8%. For the fourth quarter, the consensus estimate moved down 1.7% over the past 30 days.Notably, shares of Accenture have gained 28.4% in the past year, significantly outperforming the industry’s 24.1% rally. Acquisition is a Key Growth StrategyIn fiscal 2017, Accenture closed 37 acquisition deals worth $1.7 billion. So far this year, the company has either closed or is in the process of acquiring five businesses. Over the last three fiscals, Accenture has invested approximately $3.4 billion in acquiring nearly 70 companies or start-ups.For fiscal 2018, the company anticipates to invest close to $1 billion on acquiring assets. This is because acquisitions have enabled Accenture to enter new markets, diversify and broaden its product portfolio, and maintain its leading position. Going ahead, such buyouts are expected to contribute significantly to the company’s revenue stream.Accenture PLC Revenue (TTM) Accenture PLC Revenue (TTM) | Accenture PLC QuoteCloud Offers Huge OpportunitiesAccenture’s strategy of enhancing its cloud capabilities through acquisitions and partnerships should benefit the company. This is evident from the recent forecast by several independent research firms. According to a research firm, Gartner, the public cloud services market is likely to witness a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.3% during the 2016-2019 period, reaching $383.4 billion by 2020 end.In fact, we believe that exponential growth in the amount of data, complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals compelled several companies to turn to cloud-computing vendors. Therefore, considering the growing need for cloud-based applications and software, Accenture’s investments in this space are anticipated to propel long-term growth.Strengthening Digital Marketing CapabilitiesAccenture has strengthened its digital marketing capabilities through some significant acquisitions, including Reactive Media, Acquity Group Ltd., dgroup and OCTO Technology. Again, the company inked a deal to acquire New York-based digital agency, Meredith Xcelerated Marketing, last month.  Accenture Interactive is a well-integrated platform, enabling CMOs to devise marketing strategies and derive higher ROI (return on investment) from it. Considering the growing need for digital marketing, we expect Accenture’s investment in digital and marketing capabilities to boost its long-term growth. This will also facilitate the company in effectively competing with other digital marketing service providers such as IBM, Deloitte and Dell.Increasing Competition and Integration Risks Although acquisitions improve revenue opportunities along with business mix and profitability, it adds to integration risks as well. Moreover, frequent acquisitions are a distraction for management, which might impact organic growth moving ahead.Further, competition from companies like Genpact (G  -  Free Report), Cognizant (CTSH  -  Free Report) and Infosys (INFY  -  Free Report) is a mounting pressure.

812,CTSH,"If you’re looking for a profitable portfolio of stocks that will offer the best of value and growth investing, try the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy. It helps an investor gain exposure to stocks that are undervalued and have impressive growth prospects. Unlike a blend strategy, a portfolio that uses GARP investing is expected to include stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.GARP Metrics – Mix of Growth & Value MetricsThe GARP approach helps to zero in on stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main aspects that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only 16.Here are seven of the 16 stocks that made it through the screen:VMware, Inc.

813,CTSH,"Guidewire Software, Inc. (GWRE  -  Free Report) provides software products for property and casualty (P&C) insurers. Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock have gained 43.2% in the past year, substantially outperforming the industry’s rally of 31.0%.The momentum can be attributed to regular customer additions and positive acquisition synergies.Let’s delve deeper and find out why the stock is worth retaining.Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryGuidewire has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of a whopping 203.86%.Valuation Looks ImpressiveOn the valuation front too, the stock looks attractive. The company currently trades at a forward P/B multiple of 5.59x, significantly lower than the industry’s average of 10.31x.Northbound Revisions and Growth ProjectionsOver the last 30 days, fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 estimates were revised upward, resulting in the Zacks Consensus Estimate rising significantly from 60 cents to 74 cents per share. The figure reflects year-over-year growth of 25.42%.For 2019, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $1.33, translating to a year-over-year rise 31.55%.Further, it has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 8.00%.Shift to Cloud-Based ModelTransition from the term license based model to subscription base is anticipated to be beneficial for Guidewire in the long run as majority of the enterprises are expected to lean toward cloud based infrastructure.The company’s cloud deployment partner, Amazon Web Services is also gaining momentum and this is a positive. According to Gartner, the global Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) market is expected to increase at a four-year CAGR of 18.4% over 2016-2020 time frame. It reinforces the company’s growth prospects further.However, in the near term, it may negatively impact the top line as license revenues include advance payments while subscription-based revenues are a bit delayed.Acquisition StrategiesGuidewire’s acquisition strategies significantly contribute to growth. The acquisition of ISCS (now called Insurance Now), FirstBest (now called Guidewire Underwriting Management) and EagleEye Analytics (now known as Guidewire Predictive Analytics) are not only bolstering revenue growth but also aiding to expand clientele.However, this move might expose the company to integration risks consequently, creating pressure on cash flow.Other PositivesGuidewire reported stellar second-quarter results and raised fiscal 2018 guidance. The company’s elaborate partnership programs, strong performance of subscription products and strategic collaborations remain major growth drivers. The company’s Partner Connect Program has been implemented worldwide, benefiting its customers in the property and casualty insurance industry.Recently, the company’s services were selected by Atlas Financial, Mutual of Enumclaw Insurance and Mitsui Sumitomo Marine Management (U.S.A.).

The company also raised fiscal 2018 guidance.The company’s product launches, consistent investments in enhancing digital and marketing capabilities, along with major acquisitions will smoothen the path for its growth. Notable recent acquisitions include the likes of Mackevision, Altima and Rothco.Accenture’s strategy of growing through partnerships like Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and buyouts like IBB Consulting and VERAX are encouraging.However, Accenture’s announcement of creating new jobs and investment plan of $1.4 billion in the United States may dent its bottom-line results in our opinion. Additionally, stiff competition from peers having the likes of Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH  -  Free Report) and IBM Corp.

815,CTSH,"Red Hat Inc. (RHT  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Mar 26.We note that, on an average, the company has delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.73% in the trailing four quarters. In the last quarter, Red Hat delivered positive earnings surprise of 4.29%.Earnings increased 20.2% on a year-over-year basis primarily driven by strong top-line growth and operating margin expansion.Revenues increased 21.6% year over year to almost $748 million, primarily on the back of strong demand for hybrid cloud solutions. The figure was better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $734 million.Red Hat's top-line growth is benefiting from improving linearity owing to on-time renewal of deals reflecting strong demand for hybrid cloud technology solutions as well as aggressive cross-selling.Buoyed by solid results, Red Hat stock has returned 28.7% year to date, substantially outperforming the 7.8% rally in the industry it belongs to.  Outlook PositiveFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, Red Hat expects revenues between $758 million and $763 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues currently stands at $761.96 million, up 21.2% year over year.Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated to be 81 cents per share.

The company’s collaborations with cloud providers like Amazon, Google and now Alibaba positions it for significant top-line growth.This is helping Red Hat to cross-sell cloud-based technology across its customer base. Emerging technologies have also been a driving factor.Additionally, complementary acquisitions have led to a favorable product mix, which is in turn bolstering overall results. The company’s strategy of making acquisitions (3scale, Ansible, FeedHenry, eNovance, Inktank, Codenvy) that can be easily integrated into current business has expanded its product portfolio into higher-growth segments, such as Hybrid cloud and other emerging technologies (Cloud Management, OpenShift, OpenStack, and Storage).Red Hat continued to win customer in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Enterprises like Follett School Solutions, SIX Group, ZTE Corporation, and Elo selected Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform as their enterprise Kubernetes solution of choice in the quarter.During the quarter, Red Hat acquired CoreOS, an innovator and leader in Kubernetes and container-native solutions, for a purchase price of $250 million.What Our Model Says?According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

816,CTSH,"When it comes to choosing stocks, investors often opt for complex investment strategies in a bid to book higher returns. But with ever changing market dynamics, this may not yield the desired results every time. Therefore, using conventional strategies, based on key fundamentals, to choose stocks is always a wise decision.One such strategy is sales growth. Maintaining steady sales growth is the key to survival for any business. Sales growth as such remains a vital measure for any corporate house, as it is important to growth projections and strategic decision making.So, when companies incur losses for a temporary period, they are valued based on their revenues, as top-line growth (or decline) is usually an indicator of a company’s future earnings performance. Also, in contrast to price to earnings and price to book value ratios, which can turn negative and cease to be relevant, price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is available even for companies that have hit choppy waters.Additionally, profits and book value are largely influenced by several factors including accounting decisions tied with depreciation, significant charges and inventory. However, management has limited opportunities to manipulate sales, which further underscores the importance of P/S ratio. Hence, P/S ratio can serve as a more reliable metric for stock valuation. Focusing solely on sales growth is, however, not enough.A consideration of a company’s cash position along with its sales can be a more dependable strategy. Significant cash in hand and steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments.Picking the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the 12 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in West Palm Beach, FL, Platform Specialty Products Corporation (PAH  -  Free Report) produces and sells specialty chemical products. The company has expected sales growth rate of 4.4% for the current year and carries a Zacks Rank #2.Xylem Inc.

817,CTSH,"On Mar 16, VMware Inc. (VMW  -  Free Report) was upgraded to Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The upgrade reflects positive impact from the impressive fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Non-GAAP earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a nickel and increased 17.5% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues of $2.31 billion also topped the consensus mark of $2.26 billion and increased 13.6% on a year-over-year basis. The year-over-year growth was driven by robust performance of its product offerings like NSX and vSAN.Notably, VMware beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in all of the trailing four quarters. The top line also surpassed the consensus mark in all of the trailing four quarters. Vmware, Inc. Price and Consensus Vmware, Inc. Price and Consensus | Vmware, Inc. Quote Expanding Portfolio, Partnerships: Key CatalystsWe believe, expanding product portfolio, partnerships with the likes of IBM, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Pivotal and Alphabet, along with continuing enterprise deal wins, will continue to drive growth.VMware has collaborated with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to offer an integrated hybrid cloud solution, functioning much like a software-defined data center (SDDC). Apart from the internal servers, this contract enables users to run VMware software (vSphere, Virtual SAN and NSX) on the Amazon cloud.VMware recently expanded VMware Cloud on AWS to Europe. The expansion will allow European users to access a broad range of innovative AWS services including compute, databases, analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), security, mobile, application services and more.VMware also has a similar deal with IBM, which enables the company’s VSphere customers to initiate workloads on the IBM SoftLayer cloud infrastructure.Further, the company recently expanded its portfolio of cloud services that now include VMware Hybrid Cloud Extension Service for Private Cloud, Wavefront by VMware Service, Log Intelligence Service and Cost Insight Service.These factors are expected to drive VMware’s earnings growth in fiscal 2019. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 earnings has increased 6.8% to $5.95 over the last 30-days.A Solid Pick for Growth Focus InvestorsVMware sports a Growth Style Score of B.Our research shows that stocks with Growth Style Scores of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 (Buy), offer best investment opportunities in the growth investing space.Other StocksInvestors can also consider NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH  -  Free Report) from the broader technology sector.

818,CTSH,"A jobs report tailor-made to boost investor sentiment helped U.S. stocks surge higher last Friday. The biggest beneficiaries of this data were tech stocks, with the Nasdaq hitting closing and intraday records. In the process, the index recouped losses incurred during February’s correction, inching up marginally.Clearly, investors are seeking out tech stocks in an environment where growth-oriented investments are a favored option. Additionally, tech stocks have seen a successful earnings season and are expected to report strong numbers through 2018. With no roadblocks in sight, it makes sense to bet on large-cap tech stocks from the Nasdaq 100 at this point.Tech Stocks Rebound From February Correction During the week ended Feb 9, the Nasdaq Composite index declined 5.1%, suffering its worst losses since early 2016. And it has taken only a month for the tech-heavy index to recover completely. On Mar 9, the index gained 1.8% to close at 7560.81, around 0.33% higher than the previous record achieved on Jan 26.Additionally, the Nasdaq 100, which is made up of the 100 largest companies in the index, hit a record level. The Nasdaq is now up 9.5% year to date while the S&P 500 has gained only 3.4%. The broader market benchmark is yet to fully recover from February’s selloff, thanks to inflationary concerns.But in a market captivated by superior momentum levels, the likes of Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) have once again become investor favorites. Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Amazon each gained 1.7% on Mar 9 while Netflix rose 4.6%. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index gained 2.1%.Strong Earnings Expectations, Lack of ImpedimentsAs of Mar 7, we have received Q4 results from 98.2% of the sector’s market cap in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these tech companies are up 23.6% from the same period last year on 10.9% higher revenues. Additionally, for full-year 2018, total earnings for these companies are expected to rise 22.7% on 10.9% higher revenues. (Read: A Very Positive Earnings Picture)Strong earnings prospects are among the key reasons why tech stocks have once again caught investors’ imagination. Given the strong economic backdrop, this class of assets has become a favored option among investors since they are growing at a faster pace than the overall economy.Also, there is a clear absence of factors which could snap the ongoing tech gains, at least in the short term. This is why they are becoming favored choices, much in keeping with one of last year’s top stock strategies, sticking with winning options. Further, investors are choosing to ignore any associated volatility which accompanies such an investment strategy.Our ChoicesTech stocks have rebounded within a month of February’s correction, outpacing their equity counterparts. Investors have chosen to focus on their strong earnings prospects and the lack of impediments to future gains. This class of equities is probably the most favored growth choices even as the economy goes from strength to strength.Given this backdrop, it makes sense to bet on large-cap tech stocks which make up the Nasdaq 100. Notably, this prominent large-cap index also hit a record high on Mar 9. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score.We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM Score.Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) is one of the world’s largest suppliers of equipment for the fabrication of semiconductor, flat panel liquid crystal displays (LCDs), and solar photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules.Applied Materials has a VGM Score of B.

819,CTSH,"Investors on the lookout for stocks with the potential for maximum growth and value investing may consider the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy.This popular strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks with impressive growth prospects that are trading at a discount. GARP investing employs popular value metrics — price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book value (P/B) ratio — to evaluate whether a stock is undervalued.GARP Metrics – Mix of Growth & Value MetricsThe GARP approach helps identify stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics — price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only 16.Here are seven of the 16 stocks that made it through the screen:VMware, Inc.

820,CTSH,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (CTSH  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 8.8% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is CTSH due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Recent EarningsCognizant reported fourth-quarter 2017 non-GAAP earnings of $1.03 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6 cents and increased 18.4% from the year-ago quarter. The figure was better than management’s expectation of 98 cents.The company recorded a one-time provisional income tax expense of $617 million related to the Tax Reform Act, which reduced GAAP earnings by $1.04 per share in the fourth quarter. This one-time expense was primarily attributable to the deemed repatriation tax on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.Revenues of $3.83 billion were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate but improved 10.6% year over year driven by growth in all the four domains. The figure was within management’s guidance of $3.79-$3.85 billion.2017 at a GlanceIn 2017, earnings increased 11.2% year over year to $3.77 per share.Revenues increased 9.8% to $14.81 billion.

Moreover, Cognizant is benefiting from accretive acquisitions. The company completed the acquisition of Netcentric and Zone in the fourth quarter.Further, the company has attained deep industry expertise and knowledge of the domains through partnerships with top firms like Microsoft and SAP SE.This strategy has enabled Cognizant to deliver more value to clients and capitalize on new opportunities. It has also provided a competitive edge against the likes of Accenture, Infosys and Wipro Ltd.Quarter DetailsSegment-wise, Financial services (37.3% of revenues), which includes insurance, banking and transaction processing, grew 5.4% year over year to $1.43 billion. The segment was driven by double-digit growth in insurance companies and mid-tier banks, which offset the softness arising from large banks.Healthcare (29.4% of revenues) grew 11.9% year over year to $1.09 billion. Top-line growth was driven by steady demand across payer clients and increasing interest in the company’s digital, analytics, cloud and virtualization solutions.Products and Resources (20.4% of revenues) continued its growth momentum and improved 13.7% year over year to $782 million driven by growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities clients.Communications, Media and Technology (12.9% of revenues) were $494 million, up 19% from the year-ago quarter.Region-wise, revenues from North America increased 8.5% year over year and represented 77% of total revenues.Revenues from the United Kingdom increased 5.1% year over year (7.5% of revenues).

821,CTSH,"Momentum investing calls for a continuous appraisal of stocks, which ensures that an investor does not pick a beaten-down name and overlook a thriving one. Momentum investors buy high on the anticipation that the stock will only ascend further in the short-to-intermediate term.We believe the recent stock market upsurge presents an ideal buying opportunity for momentum investors. The market is highly anticipated to continue its bullish run driven by an improving macro-economic scenario. Notably, the Conference Board Leading Economic Index for the United States increased in January, which supports continuing economic growth.Moreover, positive impact of recent tax-reform on company earnings, which will be more prominent in the current quarter, is expected to provide a significant boost to the bull market.Technology Momentum ContinuesTechnology has been one of the most lucrative sectors for investors, year to date. The technology-heavy NASDAQ Composite (IXIC) is up almost 7.6% as compared with S&P 500’s growth of roughly 2%.The Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) has also gained 8.2% on a year-to-date basis. Powershares QQQ ETF (QQQ) has also increased 9%.The sector is benefiting from increasing demand for cutting-edge technology such as cloud computing, Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT), wearables, AR/VR headsets, drones, self-driving cars and artificial intelligence (AI).Although technology stocks will benefit less from the corporate tax cuts, they hoard huge cash overseas and are poised to benefit the most from Trump's repatriation policy. Moreover, higher domestic cash level will make the technology stocks less susceptible to an anticipated interest rate hike in 2018.Further, improving liquidity level will allow these companies to spend more on the emerging technologies like ADAS, IoT and AR/VR.Spending to Grow ExponentiallyBlackRock expects ADAS market to grow at least 20% each year through 2025, creating significant growth opportunity for manufacturers of camera lenses, sensors and other items.Per market research firm IDC, global spending on robotics and drones solutions will increase 22.1% year over year to $103.1 billion in 2018. This spending is projected to grow at a CAGR of 25.4% over 2018-20121 time frame to $218.4 billion.Moreover, global spending on IoT will grow 14.6% year over year to reach $772.5 billion in 2018. IDC predicts global spending on IoT to surpass $1 trillion mark in 2020 and reach $1.1 trillion by 2021.In addition to these positive data, IT spending is expected to grow. Gartner now projects global IT spending for 2018 to rise 4.5%, up from 3.8% in 2017.Our PicksThe trick to achieve success in momentum investing is based on the risk-appetite of the investor. Momentum investing is not for the faint-hearted and success comes only to those who can effectively ride the upswing and brave the downswing of the market with the same élan. It is here that the Zacks Style Score System can come in handy.We use the Zacks Momentum Style Score to pick stocks. The style score indicates the best time to buy a stock and take advantage of its momentum with a highest probability of success. Moreover, we prefer large caps due to their fundamental strength and stability amid increasing volatility in markets.Back-tested results show that stocks with Momentum Style Scores of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) handily outperform other stocks.Here, we have identified six great momentum stocks, each having market cap of more than $15 billion.NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) offers graphics chip processors and related software for a wide range of visual computing platforms.

Per Forbes, Bezos is worth $112 billion, up $39.2 billion from 2017, the biggest one-year gain in the list’s history.Amazon’s strong share price movement driven by impressive performance has been a key catalyst behind the massive rise in Bezos’ wealth. Amazon carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has returned 81.6% in the past year, significantly outperforming the industry’s rally of 66.5%.Growth Prospects RobustAmazon is primarily benefiting from sustained momentum in Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) and its ubiquitous presence in retail.

828,CTSH,"The world’s largest and the ultra-popular large cap ETF, SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, has been enjoying its strong asset accumulation on the completion of its 25th anniversary. This is because it has become the first ETF with $300 billion in AUM. Though SPY’s inception date is Jan 22, 1993, it officially debuted on the American Stock Exchange on Jan 29, 1993 (read: Amazing ETF Strategies for Skyrocketing Markets).Inside The ETFSPY tracks the S&P 500 index and holds 505 stocks in its basket, with each security holding no more than 3.62%. This suggests a nice balance across each security and prevents heavy concentration.About one-fourth of the portfolio is tilted toward the information technology sector, which has fully emerged from the burst of the dot-com bubble and is flying higher in the current bullish market. Moreover, financials, health care, consumer discretionary and industrials, each of which accounts for a double-digit exposure, are also performing remarkably well.The ETF charges 9 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in heavy volume of 71.6 million shares a day on average. This ensures higher liquidity with a tight bid/ask spread, leading to lower trading costs for investors (see: all the Large Cap ETFs here).Factors Driving SPYThe U.S. stock market is in the midst of the second-longest bull run in history. Encouraging domestic and international fundamentals as well as better-than-expected corporate earnings are the major catalysts. This, coupled with Trump’s pro-growth agenda aimed at accelerating economic growth, reducing regulation, increasing spending, slashing taxes, and boosting jobs and corporate profits, are bolstering optimism in the economy.Since Trump’s win, the stock market rally has been the fourth largest since 1936, according to Goldman Sachs. Per Sam Stovall of CFRA Research, the S&P 500 rally during Trump’s first year is the third best since World War II, behind only President George H. W. Bush and President John F. Kennedy (read: Trump's First Year in Office: 5 Must-See ETF Charts).Further, a combination of other factors like rise in oil prices, a weak dollar and rounds of upbeat global economic data have bolstered the appetite for riskier assets in recent months. Good news flowing despite the global trade fears, political instability in Washington and geopolitical tension.As a result, SPY generated more than 545% returns over the past 25 years and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook.

830,CTSH,"Investors often fail to think through sales growth as a dependable metric when it comes to picking winning stocks. This might be because of their preconceived notion that a company’s stock price is typically sensitive to its earnings momentum. However, betting on stocks completely depending on such a perception may not prove worthwhile.It’s worth keeping in mind that in cases when companies incur a loss, albeit transitorily, they are valued based on their revenues not earnings, as top-line growth (or decline) is usually an indicator of a company’s future earnings performance. In contrast with price to earnings and price to book value ratios, which can turn negative and cease to be relevant, the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is available even for firms that have hit choppy waters.Further, a company can improve earnings by resorting to cost control measures while maintaining stable revenues. But superior profits could be achieved through continued revenue growth.Also, earnings and book value are largely influenced by several factors including accounting decisions tied with depreciation, significant charges and inventory. However, management has limited opportunities to manipulate sales, which further underscores the importance of P/S ratio.A huge sales number does not necessarily convert into profits. Hence, considering a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be more prudent. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow lend a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments.Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the 15 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in St. Petersburg, FL, Raymond James Financial, Inc. (RJF  -  Free Report) is engaged in the underwriting, distribution, trading, and brokerage of equity and debt securities, and the sale of mutual funds and other investment products.

834,CTSH,"The third-quarter reporting cycle is past the halfway mark with 272 S&P 500 members, representing 64.2% of the index’s total market capitalization, having already released their results.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings of these companies are up 8.7% on a year-over-year basis (75.7% of the companies beat EPS estimates). Total revenues are up 6.7% (66.2% of the companies beat top-line estimates).Third-quarter earnings of S&P 500 companies are anticipated to be up 5.4% from the year-ago quarter on revenues that are estimated to increase 5.5%. Notwithstanding the weak performance of the Finance sector, total earnings from the remaining index are expected to rise 7.7% while revenues are anticipated to grow 6.1% on a year-over-year basis.Notably, estimate revisions for the fourth quarter have been favorable. Though estimates largely moved north at the beginning of the earnings season, of late, there has been some movement in the opposite direction. Consequently, estimates are currently at the same level as the beginning of the quarter. However, with more companies releasing better-than-expected results, the revisions are anticipated to trend upward again.Technology Earnings Picture So FarAs of Oct 27, 54.4% of the total market capitalization has reported results. Total earnings of these technology companies surged 22% on a year-over-year basis (79.3% of the companies beat EPS estimates) while total revenue increased 8% (86.2% of the companies beat top-line estimates).The sector is benefiting from increasing demand for data centers, cloud-based platforms, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS), Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.These were evident from recent results reported by Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Microsoft.ExpectationsEarnings for the technology sector are now anticipated to be up 16% (up from 99%) on top-line growth of 7.6% (up from 6.9%).Let’s take a sneak peek into three technology companies that are set to report their quarterly earnings on Nov 1:We expect Facebook, Inc’s (FB  -  Free Report) results to be driven by strength in online and mobile advertising revenues as well as Instagram in third-quarter 2017.Facebook’s mobile ad business has fast emerged as the major contributor to its advertising revenues. Digital ad revenues are expected to sustain the momentum. Notably, Instagram’s ad platform is also an important cash cow for the company.Additionally, a huge user base of over 2 billion is a major positive for Facebook.Though it is approaching saturation level in North American and European markets, growth possibilities abound in Asia and the rest of the world.However, with ramped up investments, increasing cost is a headwind for the company. Moreover, increasing competition from Snapchat and Twitter is a concern.Facebook stock has gained 56.4% year to date, substantially outperforming the 29.5% rally of the industry it belongs to. Facebook currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.We anticipate ANSYS Inc (ANSS  -  Free Report), the dominant player in the high-end design simulation software market, to gain from its strong simulation portfolio in the third quarter. Growing recurring revenues base is also a positive. The company’s collaborations with the likes of NVIDIA, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, PTC and Synopsys are further tailwinds.However, transition from perpetual license contracts to longer term, time-based licenses at some of the company’s largest customers (in mature markets like the United States and Japan) is expected to affect software license and maintenance revenue growth in the near term.Shares of ANSYS have gained 46.8% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 36.3% rally. ANSYS currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp’s (CTSH  -  Free Report) third-quarter results are expected to be driven by its domain expertise and development of capabilities in sync with the ongoing digital transition. Acquisitions and partnerships have also played an important role in the company’s growth.However, geographic concentration risks with North America being a significant revenue contributor, and increasing competition from peers like Accenture, Infosys and Wipro are headwinds.Cognizant stock has gained 34.7% year to date, outperforming the 26.9% rally of the industry it belongs to. Cognizant currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

835,CTSH,"Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp (CTSH  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 1. In the trailing four quarters, the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions, delivering an average positive surprise of 1.72%.Last quarter, Cognizant delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.33%. Revenues of $3.67 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.66 billion and increased 8.9% year over year driven by growth across all the four domains.For the third quarter of 2017, Cognizant expects revenues in the range of $3.73–$3.78 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be 94 cents per share.Shares of Cognizant have gained 34.5% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 26.9% rally.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayCognizant’s domain expertise is a key catalyst. The company is consistently developing its capabilities to benefit from the ongoing digital transition, especially when it comes to integration of the new digital framework with legacy technology platforms.Cognizant is significantly benefiting from accretive acquisitions. The buyouts have not only led to an increase in new customers but also enhanced its overall digital delivery capabilities.The company’s large exposure to fast growing financial service and health care sector, through partnerships with top firms like Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), has helped it to outpace Tier-1 peers.Notably, Cognizant completed the acquisition of TMG Health in August. The integration of TMG Health and the company’s TriZetto platform reinforces its leading service provider position for the government-managed healthcare programs in the United States. It will enable the company to expand its healthcare offerings and thereby cater to growing demand from its payer clients.Growth in the company’s Products & Resources segment along with its Communications, Media and Technology segments is also anticipated to boost its top line. The company’s share-repurchase initiatives are expected to drive the bottom line.However, Cognizant is exposed to significant geographic concentration risks with North America contributing to the majority of its revenues. Therefore, opening of its new London Digital Business Collaboratory in July is a positive in our view.Further, competition from peers like Accenture, Infosys and Wipro is a major concern. Besides, increasing investment owing to the TMG Health deal and ongoing development strategies may weigh on margins.Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation QuoteWhat Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

837,CTSH,"Accenture Plc (ACN  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Sep 28. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 1.33%. Notably, over the last four quarters, it has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.6%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderWe are positive about Accenture’s latest product additions in the analytics application space, given the increasing demand for digital solutions. Moreover, the company’s strategy of growing through acquisitions is encouraging. These acquisitions have enabled Accenture to foray into new markets, diversify and broaden its product portfolio, as well as maintain a leading position. We believe these will have a positive influence on the company’s upcoming quarterly results.Furthermore, the recent forecast for worldwide IT spending by Gartner gave some optimism about Accenture’s near-term performance. The research firm estimates worldwide IT spending to grow 2.4% to $3.48 trillion, marking a solid recovery after two consecutive years of decline.The research firm noted two major catalysts which, it believes, will drive IT spending this year. The first catalyst highlighted by Gartner is decline in the U.S. dollar against several foreign currencies. Secondly, the firm foresees an uptick in digital transformation projects in the near term, which will enable organizations to spend more on IT related infrastructure, products, and services. All these encourage us about the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter overall performance.Nonetheless, Accenture’s February 2017 announcement of creating 15K new jobs by 2020 and investment plan of $1.4 billion for employee training and opening of 10 innovation centers across the U.S. cities may dent its bottom-line results, in our opinion. The company has already started to work on this space, by opening two innovation centers and hiring people over there.The company is believed to be preparing itself for a more protectionist U.S. technology-visa program under President Trump. It should be noted that out of more than 394,000 of its total workforce, 140,000 are in India, which provides it a cost advantage. With the addition of 15,000 new jobs, Accenture’s total employee count in the United States will increase by 30% to 65,000, thereby increasing its salary expenses significantly.Additionally, heightening competition from peers such as Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH  -  Free Report) and International Business Machines Corporation, as well as an uncertain macroeconomic environment may deter its growth to some extent.Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings is pegged at $1.46 on $9-billion revenue projection.Accenture PLC Price and EPS Surprise Accenture PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Accenture PLC QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Accenture will likely beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Accenture’s Earnings ESP is -0.29%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Accenture carries a Zacks Rank #2. Though a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a couple of companies which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Paychex, Inc. (PAYX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.06% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Constellation Brands Inc (STZ  -  Free Report), has an Earnings ESP of +0.99%, and carries a Zacks Rank #2.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be 89 cents per share.Shares of Cognizant have gained 48.5% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 18.2% rally.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayCognizant is consistently developing its capabilities to benefit from the ongoing digital transition, especially when it comes to integration of the new digital framework with legacy technology platforms. Accretive acquisitions have been a key catalyst in this regard.Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation QuoteOver the past few years, Cognizant outpaced its Tier-1 peers on account of more exposure to fast-growing verticals like Financial Services and Healthcare. High quality, lower cost technology services and strategic partnership with the likes of Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and SAP SE are also big positives for the company.Moreover, Cognizant’s expansion into Latin America with the opening of the new center in Sao Paulo, Brazil is positive for the company’s top-line growth. Further, lower share count due to aggressive share buyback is expected to drive earnings in the going-to-be reported quarter.However, the company is witnessing some sluggishness of late in the healthcare and financial sector. Stiff competition from peers like Accenture, Infosys and Wipro is a major concern.Moreover, second-quarter earnings is expected to be negatively impacted by additional costs related to severance (including voluntary separation program) lease termination and other facility-related shutdown costs as well as higher advisory fees.Earnings WhispersHowever, our proven model does not conclusively show that Cognizant is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Cognizant’s Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 82 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Cognizant carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:CACI International (CACI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.83% and carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.NetEase (NTES  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.25% and holds a Zacks Rank #2.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>
