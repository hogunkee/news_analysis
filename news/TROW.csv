9,TROW,"The premise for this Retirement Planning Guide 2018 is straightforward. Plan for a retirement that lets you do what you want, when you want. That might entail not working at all, working less in the same field or striking out in a whole new dream career.But how do you go about it? And perhaps most important, how can you afford your dream?The short answer is start early and save heavily. While you're saving and investing, come up with a comprehensive plan that will carry you to a comfortable retirement, whichever form it takes.IBD's Retirement Planning Guide 2018 helps you answer those questions in more detail. Stories in this retirement planning guide cover such issues as how to create the best retirement plan. You'll also find an estate planning checklist and coverage of the best places to retire, working after retirement and how to deal with Social Security.""Many articles advise, now that you're retired, you should do something exciting,"" said Natalie Choate, an attorney with the Boston law firm Nutter McClennen & Fish. You should get out of your comfort zone by skydiving or buying a motorcycle or taking a jungle safari. Or so they say.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseChoate, whose classic book, ""Life and Death Planning for Retirement Benefits,"" is in its 7th Edition, has a different message and a different method. Before stepping out of that airplane, run through your estate planning checklist. These list items will include a will, living trust, power of attorney and advance health care directive.""Take a minute or a rainy weekend and do something boring,"" she said. ""Find and organize all your retirement plan records. You can save yourself and your heirs a lot of trouble (and money) just by doing some paperwork.""Such paperwork can indicate how far along you are in lining up the funds for your retirement. ""Retirees have more responsibility now,"" said IRA expert Ed Slott, founder of IRAhelp.com. ""In the past, more people had pensions. Now people have 401(k)s and IRAs, which they must manage to last for a long retirement.""Now that 401(k)s and IRAs have largely replaced traditional private-sector pensions, it's a new era when it comes to retirement.  And that takes new thinking. It's no longer automatic to plan to retire at 65, receive Medicare and Social Security benefits, and live on income from investment interest and dividends.In 2018, the retirement age spectrum stretches from the 40s to the 70s and even beyond. With so many opportunities, it all depends on how you want to shape your life.Never before have there been so many tools at your disposal to build a financially independent life, as early as you want. Retirement vehicles include 401(k)s and IRAs — both regular and Roth versions — annuities and separate accounts. You can get referrals or search online for a financial advisor to help you plan for retirement.Your employer's 401(k) plan likely offers education on how to get started, build up your savings and maintain your nest egg in these tax-advantaged accounts. Fund companies and award winning stock brokers like Fidelity Investments, Charles Schwab (SCHW), T. Rowe Price (TROW), TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and TradeStation offer tons of educational material. Their associates offer various levels of assistance in opening accounts and setting up a financial plan.But it all begins with savvy retirement planning, and this Retirement Planning Guide 2018 has the information you'll need for a personalized notes-to-self memo.The actions you take today will have a critical, lasting impact on how you live in retirement. It starts with a plan and a knowledge of how to put that plan into action to achieve your financial goals.Smart investment planning underpins having enough money in retirement. Investing on a regular schedule, especially through automatic withdrawals into a tax-deferred retirement account such as a 401(k), can create an effective and effortless strategy to build up retirement savings.Today's investment scene presents some daunting challenges. Stocks are near record levels, raising fears that we could see a repeat of the retreats investors experienced in 2000 and 2008.Such pullbacks can put stocks ""on sale,"" as they have in the past, for investors with many years before retirement. Millennials — investors now in their 20s or 30s — might do especially well if they can overcome their fears (and their student loan debt) to stick with stocks.But people who are near or just starting retirement are at greater risk from a steep market pullback in the next year or two. Decades' worth of savings could be wiped out and never fully replaced, if they are drawing down their portfolio.Near and new retirees can avoid this risk by switching to cash, but yields are puny now. Taking a middle ground might be prudent.""During bull markets, like the one we have been experiencing, clients often forget the importance of holding fixed income in their portfolios,"" said certified financial planner Robert Westley, a vice president and wealth advisor at Northern Trust in New York. He added that retirees should have enough fixed income to support their spending needs for a number of years in the event of a market drop.An allocation to fixed income may help to keep retirees from having to sell equities at depressed values, so they can ride out a market downturn. ""Investors should utilize prudent asset location planning when determining where to hold their target equity and fixed income exposure,"" Westley said.""Asset location planning consists of considering the different tax characteristics of asset classes and the vehicles or accounts where they are held in order to gain a better after-tax rate of return,"" said Westley, who is a CPA/PFS and serves on the AICPA's Personal Financial Specialist Credential Committee. For example, corporate bonds and corporate bond funds that generate ordinary interest income are best held in a tax-deferred retirement account while municipal bond holdings that pay federally tax-free income work better in a taxable account.The more things change, the more they stay the same. That includes perennial worries about the future of Social Security.Meanwhile, the dependence of many retirees on Social Security also remains the same. With sub-3% yields on 10-year Treasury notes now, annual cash flow of, say, $25,000 from Social Security equals more retirement income than $800,000 of those Treasuries. With favorable taxation and inflation protection as well as lifetime payouts, Social Security still addresses key retiree concerns, so it's well worth the effort to keep up with tactics to boost benefits.What's more, the rules on mixing earned income with Social Security benefits have been eased. Our story about working after retirement shows you how to pick up extra income or pursue a dream career yet still get a full payout from Uncle Sam.For many people, retirement equals relocation. This special report's article on where to live after retirement explores what you need to know about where to call home, from staying put (familiar surroundings) to moving within the U.S. (retirement communities) to living abroad. These days, smart technology that uses sensors, cameras and Bluetooth is helping retirees keep their homes but at the same time increase their mobility.What's more, as Slott, a CPA in Rockville Centre, New York, put it, ""Taxes are the single biggest factor in how much you can spend in retirement."" The recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 increased the tax pressure to cross state lines for many retirees.Previously, taxpayers might have been able to deduct all of their state and local tax (SALT) from their income, on federal tax returns. Now SALT deductions are capped at $10,000 a year. This limit may cause many people, especially retirees who aren't work-bound to high-tax states, to go where they can reduce their SALT outflow.""The new tax law also affected IRAs,"" Slott said. The impact will be felt when people convert tax-deferred traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs, which eventually may deliver tax-free cash flow. The low tax rates in the new law can reduce the tax from such conversions.But Roth IRA conversions can't be undone, as they have in the past. ""The IRS recently explained that conversions from 2017 can be reversed, completely or partially, until this Oct. 15,"" said Slott. A reversal might make sense if the IRA owner doesn't want to pay the full amount of the tax, say, or if the account has lost value.""From now on, this type of recharacterization won't be allowed,"" Slott said. So Roth IRA conversions might be best implemented late in the year, when they may be calculated to qualify for a relatively low tax rate.The new tax law also increased the federal estate tax exemption to about $11 million. Thus, fewer retirees will have less to worry about in estate tax planning.That said, this special report's estate planning checklist story goes over what documents you need in order to make your assets transfer as intended.Attorney Choate urges retirees to make sure retirement plan and other beneficiary designations are up to date. ""Review them with your estate planning lawyer and make sure you and the plan administrator agree on who is the beneficiary,"" she said.Your assets generally will flow to the beneficiary of record, even if your will says otherwise.Therefore, this Retirement Planning Guide 2018 offers a powerful lineup that can help you make a smooth transition from workforce to work-free or work less.There's also an article describing what IBD's CAN SLIM investment program can do for your retirement account before and after you retire. And check out the Q&A with prominent financial advice expert Ric Edelman.From start to finish, this special report will help you create and maintain a financial plan that can help to ensure your financial success, even after the paychecks stop.RELATED:Are Stocks Going Up?

10,TROW,"Mutual funds make perfect sense for most investors, but especially the busy or novice investor. But do you really know how to buy mutual funds to meet your objectives, or for that matter, how to sell mutual funds?By investing in a fund, you get professional management and access to a diversified portfolio of stocks and/or bonds at a reasonable cost. Funds also increase the likelihood of reaching your retirement or other financial goals.But mutual funds come in all shapes and sizes, so you need a way to pick the best funds for you.  A few quick steps will put you in a portfolio of funds custom-designed for you.You can take these steps with the help of a financial advisor or with guidance provided by brokerages and major mutual fund companies, including Fidelity, Charles Schwab (SCHW), T. Rowe Price (TROW), Vanguard, American Funds, Franklin Templeton (BEN), JPMorgan Chase (JMP) and BlackRock (BLK).Your advisor, fund company or broker provides forms where you fill in your age, current assets, expected retirement and income needs and risk tolerance. Not sure about your risk tolerance? Don't worry, the questionnaires will suss it out. The details of your investor profile will help guide you to the funds appropriate for your portfolio.Your profile will include a time horizon, or when you need the money and how long you have to invest. You want to buy a car next year, a house within five years, get the kids in college in 16 years and retire at 66? Obviously, you can have more than one goal, so you should construct portfolios with each in mind.Your age also affects your investment horizon. For example, you wouldn't invest for retirement when you're 20 the same way as when you're 55.Your investor profile will help you zero in on your target allocation between stocks and bonds, and domestic and foreign securities. This is the asset mix you will achieve in the selection of mutual funds for your portfolio. Generally, the younger you are, the longer your investment horizon and the more risk you can tolerate.Stock funds, though they provide higher returns over time, tend to be more volatile than bond funds. So the younger you are the more aggressive you can be investing in stocks, as any temporary declines will be made up as the stock market recovers and moves on to new highs. When you're nearing or in retirement and less tolerant of volatility, your investor profile becomes more conservative and will guide you to greater allocation to bond funds.How many will you need? That could range from one to more than a half-dozen.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseYour selection work will be over if you choose target-date funds. You'll only need one because it invests in a diversified mix of mutual funds, each itself diversified across a broad array of stocks and bonds. Major fund families offer these funds, which change their asset mix as time goes on to suit your evolving risk tolerance.For example, if you plan to retire in eight years or so, you could chose Vanguard Target Retirement 2025 (VTTVX), which happens to be the largest target-date fund, at $39.83 billion. It invests in four Vanguard funds. According to Morningstar Direct, its top weights are 38.2% of funds invested in Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSMX), 25.7% in Vanguard Total Bond Market II Index Fund (VTBIX), 25.2% in Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund (VTSNX)  and 11% in Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund (VTIBX).T. Rowe Price, Fidelity, American Funds, JPMorgan and Principal Funds are also big players in target-date funds.If you work with a financial advisor or a broker, he or she will build your investment profile and then present you with an appropriate portfolio of funds.If you want to build your own, you can either build your portfolio exclusively or mostly at one fund company with many funds, or with funds from many fund companies.If you choose to have your portfolio at one company, you can open the account at any of the major fund companies. If you pick and choose the best funds from several fund companies, then you'll do that through your brokerage account at Schwab, Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, E-Trade or any of the other brokers that have a platform for investing in funds.The traditional breakdown for an average risk tolerance is 60% equities and 40% bonds. The percentage of equities can be 80% for younger people and those with more aggressive risk tolerance, and be 20% for those closer to retirement and with lower risk tolerance.You and your advisor will fine-tune the asset mix.""For the average investor, on the equity side, 65% should be in U.S. stocks and the rest should be in international,"" said Ed Kohlhepp, CEO of Kohlhepp Investment Advisors, a registered investment advisor (RIA) , in Doylestown, Pa. ""Of the U.S. stock funds, 65% should be in large cap and the rest split between small- and midcap funds.  Of the international funds, two-thirds in developed country funds and the rest in emerging markets.""Most advisors recommend your large-cap stock fund be an index fund that tracks the S&P 500, such as the Vanguard 500 Index (VFINX). And look for active funds in the small and midcap areas.Kohlhepp said that with interest rates rising, investors should favor bond funds with shorter durations, which means their prices, or NAVs, are less sensitive to changes in interest rates. He suggested buying at least one fund each that invests in U.S. Treasuries, corporates and high-yield bonds. He said foreign bonds should not be more than 15% of your bond allocation.When you start your search, you want to look for funds that have outperformed their benchmarks over a range of periods, because they are more likely to have proven investment strategies than those that don't. The winners of the IBD Mutual Funds Awards are a good place to start. IBD Weekly's Fund & Personal Finance section runs screens of top-performing funds (with daily screens covering several categories appearing online under Funds & ETFs at investors.com/ibd-data-tables).Morningstar Inc. and Lipper Inc. are two prominent fund-ranking services that feature risk-adjusted ratings.However, performance isn't the only criteria when picking a fund.Eric Aanes, the president of Titus Wealth Management, an RIA in Larkspur, Calif., said his three criteria for choosing a mutual fund are manager tenure, expenses and, finally, performance.Some advisors insist on a long record. ""We also want to see longevity of a fund manger,"" said Al Martinez, managing director at Hightower Advisors Boca Raton, an RIA in Boca Raton, Fla. ""We are trying to find managers that distinguish themselves in an up market, but protect in down markets.""Martinez looks at the manager's tenure and whether it's an individual or a team approach. He prefers a team. He then wants to see if the managers ""eat their own cooking. Do they invest in their own fund?"" Third, is the fund allowed to hold cash? This is important, because ""it will smooth out and provide protection when a downturn ultimately comes."" This also allows the manager to make purchases when opportunities arise.The most important thing you need to know about how to sell mutual funds may be when you should get out of a fund. A fund that underperforms its benchmark badly or for a prolonged period should be put on review for replacement. Also pay attention to manager changes.Marina Gross, executive vice president of portfolio research and consulting at Natixis Global Asset Management in Boston, said it's important to tag an investment with a purpose and hold it accountable to that role in the portfolio. If it fails to deliver on that objective, that's a reason for selling it.""Assign a purpose or a role to the asset in the portfolio,"" Gross said. ""If your equities are meant to drive returns then that is the key criteria; if the utility value is risk mitigation then that's the basis by which you measure your funds.""""The reasons for selling a fund are situational,"" said Roger Young, senior financial planner at fund giant T. Rowe Price. These include changing your allocation or risk level, rebalancing the portfolio, feeling stock values are too high and wanting to reduce exposure, favoring another opportunity, or you need the cash.A version of this article originally was published April 3, 2017.You  Might Also Like:Here's The 2018 List Of The Best Mutual Funds Award Winners By CategoryHow To Invest Like Fidelity Stock Gurus Will Danoff And John RothTips For Keeping Your Retirement Plan On Track — Read Our Full ReportView Profiles Of Top Performing Mutual Funds

They continued lower Friday, even as the broad stock market indexes rallied.XAhead of Thursday's rout, the top three U.S. financial funds outperformed the S&P 500 based on their year-to-date returns through Aug. 8. However, they all lag the benchmark index over the past three and five years.Leading the group is iShares MSCI Europe Financials (EUFN), with a year-to-date gain of 26.7% through Aug. 8, more than double the S&P 500's 11.9% return. The ETF's 4% rise for the month also led the top performers (see table below).EUFN, which tracks the MSCI Europe Financials Index, has attracted $1.7 billion in assets since its January 2010 launch. Shares dipped the past three sessions and may be heading toward a potential test of the 50-day moving average line.The U.K. was its biggest exposure as of Aug. 9, at nearly 29% of assets. France was next with about 12%, followed by Switzerland, Spain and Germany at roughly 11% each. The biggest holdings included the U.K.'s HSBC Holdings (HSBC), Spain's Banco Santander (SAN), Allianz of Germany and France's BNP Paribas (BNP). The top 10 stocks accounted for 44% of assets.IShares Global Financials (IXG) came in second with a 15.8% YTD performance — and a 3.3% gain for its monthly return. It too may soon test support at its 50-day line.The $464.8 million fund, which marks its 16th anniversary in November, tracks the S&P Global 1200 Financials Sector Index. The U.S. weighed in with 44% of assets, with the U.K. and Canada a distant second and third at 8% and 7%, respectively. Australia and Japan made up 6% and 5%.Half of its top 10 holdings were U.S.-based: Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Citigroup (C). Others in the top 10 included HSBC, Banco Santander and Allianz. The top 10 stocks accounted for 28% of assets.Both EUFN and IXG carry a 0.48% expense ratio.SPDR S&P Capital Markets (KCE) has returned 13.7% this year through Aug. 8. It sank just below its 50-day line Thursday as the U.S. stock market sold off. If it can make a solid rebound, that could set up a buy opportunity. But the market uptrend is under pressure, which increases risk of all purchases.The $108 million fund, which will turn 12 in November, tracks the KBW Capital Markets Index.

21,TROW,"The latest list of new buys by top performing mutual funds shows strong demand for stocks in sectors like health care — UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET), building — NVR (NVR) and Thor Industries (THO), and chips — Applied Materials (AMAT) and Microsemi (MSCC).X Defense and financial stocks are also well represented, with Boeing (BA), Heico (HEI), Bank of America (BAC) and T. Rowe Price (TROW) making the cut.While Donald Trump and Republicans battled over how and whether to repeal and replace ObamaCare, mutual funds invested over $1 billion in just two managed care companies. Sixty-six funds scooped up approximately $805 million of shares in UnitedHealth, and 46 funds invested just over $600 million in Aetna.Additionally, 50 funds picked up $367 million of shares in Cigna (CI).That high level of institutional demand is reflected in the share prices of both stocks, which have climbed steadily higher in recent months. The consistent support along the 10-week line seen in the charts for Aetna and UnitedHealth is another indicator of how fund managers have been stepping in to protect and add to their positions.Outside of health care, big bets were also placed on BofA ($490 million), Boeing ($253 million), superregional bank PNC Financial Services (PNC) ($376 million) and Applied Materials ($214 million).On the flip side, credit card giants Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) topped the list of the latest sells by leading funds. The net number of funds selling Visa (99 selling minus 56 buying) was 43, while the number for MasterCard was 39.Despite that selling, both stocks have continued in an upward trend.E-commerce and cloud computing services behemoth Amazon (AMZN) was also on the sell list, with 26 more funds selling than buying.Since reporting a 78% decline in earnings growth for Q2 on July 27, Amazon has been pulling back and is trying to find support at its 10-week line.RELATED:Top Fund Managers Are Buying These 4 Highly Rated StocksTop Fund's Picks Include Stocks Within Buy Ranges Like Global Payments

24,TROW,"Finding the best mutual fund to protect and grow your hard-earned retirement savings can take a little skill and, it might sometimes seem, a lot of luck. Do you put your trust in the latest hot stock picker or seek out superior long-term returns?The IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards, just released for 2017, let you look for both at one time. The awards recognize top-notch funds that beat benchmark indexes in both short- and long-term comparisons. To make the cut, a mutual fund had to outperform in each of the last one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods, through Dec. 31, 2016.Whether you're looking for a new fund for your retirement plan or wondering how the funds you now own stack up, the list can help you create and maintain a high-performance portfolio.The top five funds in each category ranked by 10-year performance are singled out for special recognition.Being a four-time winner is a herculean task. Among 2,813 mutual funds of all kinds that met the criteria of having at least $100 million in assets and 10 years of operation, only 410 beat their benchmark in each period.
"
25,TROW,"Of 1,104 U.S. diversified stock mutual funds in business for the entire decade tracked by Morningstar Inc., only 44 prevailed as four-time winners.Among 470 growth mutual funds, nine emerged as award winners.The S&P 500's 11.96% gain in 2016 was a difficult hurdle for actively managed growth funds. Many funds' investment styles didn't play well during the early-year sell-off spawned by worries about a sputtering economy, or later during the June Brexit vote sell-off or November election volatility.Blend funds and value funds made big improvements. Blend funds turned in 22 winners vs. 10 last year and value funds paraded 20 funds in the winner's circle vs. three last year.In some categories, beating the benchmark was easy. Out of 428 international stock funds, 129 beat their benchmark, the MSCI EAFE. That was a 30% victory rate. The subdued performance of the EAFE index in 2016, which gained just 1%, made for a low bar for managers to clear.Whether you are looking for mutual funds to strengthen your current portfolio or just starting out, the IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards list is a great place to begin. You can pick among the funds to build core positions in your diversified retirement portfolio. International stock funds, sector funds and bond funds can help you add weight to parts of your portfolio where you want extra emphasis.Before buying remember to check which choices make the best fit in terms of your investment horizon and risk tolerance.You can build your investment profile using a financial advisor or forms provided by major fund companies such as Fidelity, Vanguard and T. Rowe Price (TROW) as well as brokers such as Charles Schwab (SCHW), TD Ameritrade (AMTD), and E-Trade (ETFC). You can get key fund information from fund prospectuses, quarterly reports and manager commentaries.What if a fund you own is not one of the award winners?You may decide to keep it if it's a perfectly good fund run by competent portfolio managers and it fits a unique need of your portfolio. Consider whether it outperformed its benchmark in most periods but narrowly missed in one or two.Some 135 U.S. equity funds came close to winning IBD Best Mutual Funds Award status. They failed to outperform in just one of the four time periods.This year's winner lists differ a lot from last year's. Many great new funds surfaced. Quite a few relatively new funds made their mark this year.Fourteen younger U.S. equity funds topped the bogey over one, three and five years but weren't old enough to have 10-year records. Ninety-two funds in all categories that were less than five years old outperformed in one and three years.It was tough for funds from last year to repeat as winners. Take the U.S. diversified stock fund category. Last year, 101 funds beat the S&P 500 in all four time periods.Of the 49 that managed that feat this year after a tough 2016, a mere four are repeat winners.Some categories were especially hard hit. Growth funds, value and small caps each had zero repeat winners. Midcaps and muni bond funds each managed to return just a single champ to the award winners' ranks.Blend, international stock and international bonds funds each managed to squeak just two 2016 winners to this year's lists.U.S. bond funds had the most success in returning titleholders to the award winners roster. One hundred fifty-nine of them distinguished themselves as four-time winners. And 14 of those were winners last year too. Their benchmark is the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index.The stumbling block that prevented so many funds from returning to the best-of-the-best lists and kept many funds from making their debuts was the topsy-turvy 2016 market.This year's winners had to be nimble enough to avoid stumbling in last year's wild and woolly steeplechase.Just because last year's winners didn't earn awards this year doesn't mean they no longer deserve to stay in your portfolio. Take a good look at the funds and see how much they underperformed their benchmark. Find out if there has been a change in fund managers or investing strategy. Watch to see if their relative performance improves.What's the secret to consistent outperformance? For Gary Miller, lead manager of $8.2 billion Victory Sycamore Established Value Fund (GETGX) — this year's top winner in the value category — one key was unwavering focus on bottom-up stock picking.To beat the benchmark, you can't imitate it. ""This means emphasizing the merits of the company-specific dynamics and the willingness to build a portfolio that looks considerably different from the benchmark,"" Miller said.And then have the market move in your favor.The market in 2017 will produce a new crop of best performers. Whether or not the latest winners will repeat, many by virtue of their proven ability to perform over the long term could be excellent choices for your retirement account.Take $3.7 billion Parnassus Endeavor (PARWX), the No. 1 fund in our U.S. diversified equity category. Its top holding is Micron Technology (MU). After last week reporting an 8,900% leap in second-quarter earnings — rising from 1 cent a share to 90 cents a share — the memory chip maker gapped up on Friday, putting it up 171% for the past 12 months. Sales mushroomed 58% year-over-year. That stock has helped power the fund up 26% in that span.Or check out $1.3 billion Champlain Small Company (CIPSX), tops in our small-cap category.

26,TROW,"Mutual fund company T. Rowe Price has a positive outlook on the economy and stock market, tempered by unknowns about the Trump presidency's impact in these areas.The risk of recession is low next year, the U.S. economy should continue to grow at a 2% clip and the U.S. stock market seems reasonably valued with a current forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 16.8, said the experts at T. Rowe Price (TROW). The big fund company, with $812.9 billion in assets under management, gave its views at its 2017 Global Market Outlook in New York Nov. 17.T. Rowe's chief U.S. economist Alan Levenson said the U.S. economy's expansion ""has room to run"" and forecast gross domestic product will grow 2% next year and possibly another 2% in 2018 depending on the policies enacted by the new Trump administration. He said the threat of recession next year is ""vanishingly low,"" but the possibility increases in two to three years.""It's difficult to discern what the president-elect will do as president,"" said Levenson. ""There is some hint that the line on trade has softened from what it was during the campaign, but on immigration it's hard to tell.""The appointment of Jeff Sessions as Attorney General leads him to believe that a hard line will be pursued on immigration and there is no evidence that they will back away from that. Levenson said that trade restrictions, such as renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement, and a tough immigration regime would be more negative for the economy and have a greater effect to the downside earlier in the year than tax cuts and fiscal stimulus would have to the upside.However, he suggested that President-elect Trump might be getting the message that he'd be doing lot of damage to U.S. businesses and jobs by imposing immigration restraints.""If I could confidently take that off the negative side of the ledger, that would make me feel better about next year, but right now there is a lot of uncertainty,"" the economist said. ""I have a lot more confidence on tax reform than on the spending side, because the GOP wants tax reform too.""Larry Puglia, the portfolio manager of $32.6 billion T. Rowe's Blue Chip Growth Fund (TRBCX) as well as its U.S. Large-Cap Core Growth Portfolios, said the market is reasonably valued based on the 25-year averages of a number of traditional measures of the S&P 500. The forward P/E ratio was 16.8 on Sept. 30, compared with the 25-year average of 15.8. Although the market has moved up since the election, it's still fairly valued, he said. Price-to-book is 2.6 compared with the average of 2.9, and the dividend yield is 2.2% compared with the average of 2.0%.""Valuation is not unreasonable and should not preclude the market from going up,"" said Puglia. ""Investors should follow a pattern of consistent investing. We don't think we're in a bubble.""IBD'S TAKE: Whether the market is overvalued or undervalued, it usually pays to know the strongest stocks driving the market now. You'll find them in IBD Leaderboard.He said parts of the market had gotten expensive, such as utilities, telecommunications and consumer staples, but they had corrected significantly and are no longer extended. Still these are not areas he favors. He likes information technology, financials, health care and industrials. However, industrials have had a big run up since the election and health care remains controversial as the fate of ObamaCare and Medicare remain uncertain.Puglia said small-cap stocks rallied hard after the election and now large-cap stocks look more attractive. And large-cap growth looks more attractive compared with large-cap value stocks.With stock dividends yielding nearly the same as the 10-year Treasury bond, about 2.2%, Puglia said that makes stocks more attractive than bonds.As for rising interest rates, when 10-year Treasury yields are below 5%, rising rates have historically been associated with rising stock prices.
"
27,TROW,"""When yields move up, stocks perform well too. That's what the analysis says,"" said Puglia. ""Few people think Treasuries will move above 5%, so that means we have a lot of running room for the rates to go up and for stock to do well.""""I think this election is potentially quite important,"" said Puglia. ""The economic policy proposed by Trump, such as cutting tax rates and lessening regulation and an infrastructure program could have a favorable impact on stocks and could bring a long bull market. But there's a lot of uncertainty, because we have to be careful not to foment a trade war.""RELATED:Top Fund Holds Stocks Suited For Trump EraSpecial Report: Dividend And Income Investing
"
28,TROW,"In their seemingly never-ending quest for yield, income investors may finally get their fix as interest rates are broadly expected to keep rising into 2017. If this trend, which started in July, is to continue, we may even see the reversal of a three-decade-long history of declining interest rates.But there's one challenge: Some areas of the bond market that generated equity-like returns this year have become overvalued, while many bond mutual funds and ETFs suffered price declines as rates ticked higher since July.In addition, the recent election results have only exacerbated this upward move in yields. The 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield surged 19 basis points the day following the election and another 26 basis points since, touching 2.45% on Dec. 1. The main reason: Bond markets reacted negatively at the prospect of higher inflation as the Trump administration takes over the reins of the U.S. economy on Jan. 20.Special Report: Dividend And Income InvestingSo, is there any juice left in the bond market and if so, where? And how can income investors protect themselves in this rising rate environment?""It's been a while since we've had the traditional or inverse relationship 'bonds up, stocks down', and I think we may be headed toward that kind of market,"" said Hugh McGuirk, portfolio manager in the fixed income division and head of the municipal bond team at T. Rowe Price (TROW). Therefore, a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds may be the best way to shield investors against potential price volatility.Nevertheless, certain pockets in the fixed income market may still provide investors with some yield and even potential price appreciation.The fixed income vehicles that first come to mind are Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, or TIPS. If you're afraid that inflation will chip away at your total return, TIPS are the go-to place.As their name indicates, these securities are backed by the U.S. Government and indexed to inflation, as measured by the consumer price index. They pay a fixed coupon, but their par is adjusted semiannually with inflation movements. Investors can purchase TIPS in $100 increments with five-, 10- and 30-year maturities. Another option is to invest in them through a mutual fund or an ETF that holds them.The $3.6 billion DFA Inflation-Protected Securities I (DIPSX) has 89% of its assets invested in TIPS. It yields 1.04% and only charges a 0.12% management fee. It's up nearly 5% year to date. The $25 billion Vanguard Inflation-Protected Secs Inv (VIPSX) has 66% of its assets in TIPS, yields 0.73% and charges a 0.2% fee. It's up 4.8% this year.In the ETF land, it's important to choose a liquid TIPS fund as many trade less than 100,000 shares a day. The $1.5 billion Schwab U.S. TIPS ETF (SCHP) has a daily average volume of 170,000, yields 0.93%, costs just 0.07% and is up 4.8% this year.""Even though we've seen those break-evens widen, we do think TIPS, on a longer-term basis, are well below what we would consider to be the fair value on a 10-year TIP,"" said Sean Rhoderick, chief investment officer, taxable fixed income at PNC Capital Advisors. ""Inflation is going to be moving toward 2% or north of that as we get into the early part of next year, just because of what's happened to oil prices, so long as they don't collapse again."" He believes TIPS are a good way to hedge longer-term risks in a portfolio.The market is now assigning a 100% probability that the Federal Reserve will raise rates in just a few days. But the yield curve shape ""may be less flattening than we tend to expect in Fed rate rising times,"" said Jason Brady, president and CEO of Thornburg Investment Management, and head of the firm's global fixed income investment team.

29,TROW,"Floating Rate Play
"
30,TROW,"As a result, he doesn't think that reaching for yield by lengthening duration in a portfolio is advantageous. In the shorter-term paper, he finds the most value in Libor (London interbank offered rate) floaters. These three-, six- and one-year floating-rate notes are priced to Libor plus an additional spread, and adjust periodically. With a current three-month Libor yield at about 90 basis points, investors may be able to keep pace with rising rates.
"
31,TROW,"""I think cash is maybe an underappreciated asset. It's been one of the best-performing assets over the last little while,"" he noted. His company holds a considerable amount in cash, providing it with dry powder for when new opportunities arise.
"
32,TROW,"Commercial paper is another option for ultrashort investment, he points out. ""There's a declining interest in the CP market ... but you can get a fairly OK return with relatively high-quality CP with a very short maturity.""
"
33,TROW,"Brady is only moderately constructive on spread products. ""Corporations generally are not paying you a whole lot to own their debt, certainly relative to their leverage level."" The decision to invest in certain credits would be a case-by-case basis, he noted.
"
34,TROW,"Financial institutions are expected to benefit from potential bank deregulation by the Trump Administration, as well as rising interest rates and a steepening yield curve. ""We still like bank paper, predominantly domestic,"" said PNC's Rhoderick.
"
35,TROW,"Lowering High Yield
"
36,TROW,"In high-yield, low-quality names have significantly outperformed higher-quality credits this year, he noted. Going forward, ""It would be an environment where we would be moving up in quality, so out of CCC or B and into BB. Not so much because we expect a material increase in defaults, just from spread compression, which really is the issue.""
"
37,TROW,"An area that's gaining more focus among high-yield investors are floating-rate bank loans. These loans are issued by banks to below-investment-grade companies, but rank higher in the company's capital structure than their fixed-rate high-yield counterparts because they are secured by the company's assets. Their yields float with Libor and reset on a quarterly basis.
"
38,TROW,"""They provide an excellent diversification for longer-duration interest-rate sensitive strategies,"" said Mark Vaselkiv, head of the global high-yield team at T. Rowe Price and lead portfolio manager of the T. Rowe Price Global High Income Fund (RPIHX). ""This is a high-yield strategy. These are below investment-grade companies. But with the economy still in reasonably good shape, defaults are low in the high-yield market. And the fact that these loans rank senior in the capital structure to high-yield bonds, we've been rotating our high-yield portfolios ... into these rate instruments.""

In the shorter-term paper, he finds the most value in Libor (London interbank offered rate) floaters. These three-, six- and one-year floating-rate notes are priced to Libor plus an additional spread, and adjust periodically. With a current three-month Libor yield at about 90 basis points, investors may be able to keep pace with rising rates.""I think cash is maybe an underappreciated asset.

Going forward, ""It would be an environment where we would be moving up in quality, so out of CCC or B and into BB. Not so much because we expect a material increase in defaults, just from spread compression, which really is the issue.""An area that's gaining more focus among high-yield investors are floating-rate bank loans. These loans are issued by banks to below-investment-grade companies, but rank higher in the company's capital structure than their fixed-rate high-yield counterparts because they are secured by the company's assets. Their yields float with Libor and reset on a quarterly basis.""They provide an excellent diversification for longer-duration interest-rate sensitive strategies,"" said Mark Vaselkiv, head of the global high-yield team at T. Rowe Price and lead portfolio manager of the T. Rowe Price Global High Income Fund (RPIHX). ""This is a high-yield strategy. These are below investment-grade companies. But with the economy still in reasonably good shape, defaults are low in the high-yield market.

48,TROW,"A new Labor Department rule seeks to keep conflicts of interest out of the financial industry, but will it actually benefit you and other investors?The idea is to save each investor thousands of dollars -- perhaps every year -- by lowering fees, making investors' investment choices clearer, helping them avoid unnecessary costs by making their expenses clearer and by forcing brokers and financial advisors to guide them to potentially more productive investments even if they are less profitable for the broker or advisor.Brokers and financial advisors are scrambling to figure out what they must do to comply with the so-called fiduciary rule, which is due to take effect next April -- unless derailed by pending industry lawsuits. Firms are putting their own new rules in place for how to interact with clients -- what sorts of advice they'll be allowed to offer to investors like you, and what sorts they won't. They're updating software. And they're sorting out how to charge customers for service, with an earthquake tilt toward fees for service and fees on assets and away from commissions on transactions.The new rule will impact mainly brokers and financial advisors who help clients invest for retirement. About $1.9 trillion in investors' assets will be affected by 2020, according to a new study by global management consultant A.T. Kearney. It expects the asset shifts will involve about $23 billion in revenue, creating big winners and losers.Mutual fund complexes alone will see investors yank out $1 trillion in assets, Kearney says, costing them $14 billion in revenue. That tectonic shift is expected to result from investors fleeing fund fees that they perceive as too high or are steered into other investments by brokers and advisors, newly leery of violating the fiduciary rule.A swarm of pending lawsuits by players in the securities industry shows the industry's concern.Key plaintiffs include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Financial Services Institute, Financial Services Roundtable, Insured Retirement Institute, Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), National Association of Fixed Annuities, American Council of Life Insurers and National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors.Individual investors should also be concerned. Sure, they should benefit from the new rule's prohibition against certain conflicts of interest.IBD'S TAKE: Wondering how to play the fiduciary rule fallout? See which publicly traded financial firms stand to benefit and which stand to lose in this IBD report.The rule will require brokers and advisors to put their clients' best interest before their own profit. Under the current standard, brokers and advisors can recommend investments so long as they are merely suitable for a client. That lets brokers and advisors recommend investments that are more profitable for them due to, say, commissions, even if other lower-cost investments would suit a client's need better.But the new rule will also have negative effects. ""Anything that has an impact of a reduction in personal touch, a potential increase in cost and/or a loss of continuity with professional advice could be characterized as negative,"" said Jason Grantz, managing sales director for the Eastern U.S. at Unified Trust Co. ""Several (effects) impact small accounts in particular."" The negatives include:To cope with changes your broker or advisor wants to implement, you might want to move assets to a firm that is prepared to deal with you in a manner more to your liking, Grantz says.On the other hand, individual investors may see benefits beyond just fewer conflicts of interest.You may see a decline in average expense ratios for funds offered to a firm's clients. That is the most frequently cited impact expected by asset managers polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence, according to Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research for GMI.""Actively managed funds charge a premium for their efforts to outperform a benchmark, even though the majority of the survey respondents think that passive funds provide comparable returns to active investing,"" Rosenbluth writes in a new report.He added, ""Asset managers will need to be cognizant that advisors will be questioning whether their clients' best interest is being served by active funds that are more expensive than their peers.""Also, pricing transparency will increase, A.T. Kearney partner Uday Singh said.And simplified investment menus, the possible demise of high-fee funds with relatively poor track records and greater focus on low-cost passive funds will help investors meet their retirement savings goals, Rosenbluth says.As brokers and advisors seek to comply with the new rule, trillions in assets will shift among various types of financial firms between 2017 and 2020. Firms gaining assets will generally also gain revenue.Wirehouses -- big, full-service brokerages -- should see assets under management (AUM) decline by a net $300 billion, with a $4 billion decline in revenue, Kearney says. Their smaller competitors, known as independent broker-dealers in the industry, will likely be hurt by lower sales of high-commission products. They should lose $350 billion in AUM, causing a $3 billion loss in revenue.Also, costs of compliance will force smaller broker-dealers to consolidate.The ranks of winners should include registered investment advisors (RIAs), who already operate as fiduciaries, and robo-advisors. Relentless publicity about high fees and costs will prompt many self-directed individual investors to take their business away from brokers and advisors. Instead, Kearney forecasts, they will shift $150 billion in assets into funds they buy directly from mutual fund firms and into ETFs. Direct sellers of funds and ETFs stand to gain $1 billion in revenue, Kearney says.Wirehouses in the line of fire, Kearney says, include Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS).Independent broker-dealers facing asset withdrawals include Raymond James (RJF) and Ameriprise (AMP).Vanguard, Betterment and Wealthfront offer robo-advisory services that stand to benefit from the shifts in assets. Charles Schwab (SCHW) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) are seen gaining inflow from self-directed investors.Retirement plan distributors like Fidelity Investments and T. Rowe Price (TROW) could see a decline in revenue from 12b-1 fees -- annual marketing and distribution fees that are part of a fund's expense ratio. But they should benefit from assets staying inside 401(k) plans longer as fewer brokers and advisors urge workers and retirees to roll over money from company-sponsored retirement plans into IRAs, Kearney says.Fidelity is expanding its menu of ETFs and low-cost funds and its robo-advisory capacity. ""Fidelity is responding to what customers want with low-cost solutions and increasing its digital offerings,"" Singh said.""Digital offerings"" include not just robo-advisory services but also easier mobile and online service. ""That creates a frictionless user experience,"" Singh said. ""The question is, will Fidelity move far enough, quickly enough?""That same question applies to many financial firms in many categories, Singh adds.As for lawsuits by financial firms and organizations, which generally charge that the DOL overstepped its authority in creating the new rule, Chicago securities-fraud attorney Andrew Stoltmann, who is not involved in any of the cases, predicts that none will derail the new rule.""Because the DOL capitulated on so many issues that were so important to the securities industry in the final draft of the rule, I think that has made the rule relatively bulletproof in terms of judicial review,"" he said.RELATED:New, Tighter Retirement-Advice Rule Raises Industry ConcernsTips For Advisors Who Are Considering Partnering With A Broker-DealerThese Investors Will Soon Get More Robo-Advisors

49,TROW,"You're poring over your 401(k) retirement plan and wondering why it hasn't moved much lately. More importantly, you want to know if there's anything you can do about it.The answer is yes, just be prepared to do a bit of homework. Your retirement account can do better than the typical 401(k).Many investment advisors don't recommend moving money around in your 401(k) at all; they often steer eventual retirees toward such investments as target-date mutual funds that try to give investors a decent return.You've probably seen them — they're the funds with, well, a date in the distant future attached to them. The date usually is the time when the investor retires. Along the way, fund managers usually seek aggressive growth at the outset if the target date is further away, then get more conservative as that date approaches.""We've seen really good success with target-date funds,"" said Judith Ward, senior financial planner for T. Rowe Price (TROW). Ward doesn't recommend a more conservative vs. aggressive strategy, but says that for the unseasoned investor, target-date funds can come in handy. That's particularly true among millennials, who are just starting out and are new to investing.""They just don't know what to do,"" she said. ""When they're on the phone, they're asking, 'Just tell me what to do.' ""Three T. Rowe funds with a target date of 2030 have returned somewhere between an average annual 7% and 9% since their inception in late 2002. Ward cautions, though, that even target-date funds can be susceptible to market downturns. In fact, two of the T. Rowe 2030 funds have lost money in the last year.David Blanchett, head of retirement research at Morningstar (MORN), agrees. He says some target-date funds dropped as much as 40% during the 2007-09 recession. His conservative vehicle of choice is an index fund. He notes that those funds usually have lower costs than more aggressive funds.But if you do choose something more aggressive, he says, ""I would look for some external validity to the quality of the fund.""Morningstar, for instance, offers Olympics-style ratings of gold, silver and bronze, he says. Other brokers have some sort of rating.Then there are some who advocate more aggressive investing in your 401(k). Craig Wear, founder and president of Q3 Advisors in suburban Houston, says high returns are out there for those who work for them, but they can't be found in such vehicles as target-date funds. Wear also runs the website My401kinvesting.com.""They do nothing to move beyond the sectors that may be showing momentum,"" Wear said. ""I just don't agree with that methodology.""Since many 401(k)s allow investors to freely move between funds at little or no cost, they can put money into more aggressive funds when markets are bullish, then into safer funds when the sell-off hits.But many 401(k) investors decline to move their money around. He says only 7% made changes between 2009 and 2015.""I don't think that's the right way to go,"" he said. One method that can yield greater returns is divert 401(k) money into safer, more conservative funds when the market is in a downturn. When it starts going up again, then put that money into more aggressive instruments, he says.""That's what our simple trend and rank portfolios do,"" he said.Investors can look to see what funds are investing in the hottest stocks such as, say, Facebook (FB) or Amazon (AMZN) — two stocks now on Investor's Business Daily's Leaderboard. But he says it may pay to look for funds investing in the sectors that include Facebook or Amazon.""I think it's a great strategy,"" he said.Related:7 Expenses That Will Fall Once You Retire

50,TROW,"So you're dutifully putting away money for retirement. Yet in those quiet moments you wonder: Am I doing the right thing? How much should I be socking away ... and which is the best strategy?The three most common strategies are the 401(k)-type account, a traditional Individual Retirement Account (IRA), and a Roth IRA. A 401(k) is a retirement savings plan sponsored by an employer. Employees invest a percentage of their paycheck before taxes are taken out. The money grows tax-free.Individuals open traditional IRAs at such financial institutions as brokerages, mutual fund and ETF companies, and banks. They usually contribute pretax dollars, sometimes after-tax dollars. This money also grows on a tax-deferred basis. When pretax traditional IRA and 401(k) withdrawals begin, they're taxed as current income.Roth 40(k)s and IRAs works the opposite way. The contributions are after-tax dollars. The money grows tax-free, and the withdrawals are tax-free after five years and you reach age 59-1/2. Ask if your 401(k) plan offers a Roth 401(k) option. Many don't.The difference in contribution limits for the various retirement vehicles is significant. If your employer offers a retirement plan, your maximum 401(k) contribution is $18,000 a year. It's the same for similar employer-offered retirement plans such as the 403(b), 457(b) Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) and Salary Reduction Simplified Employee Pension Plan (SAR-SEP).If you're more than 50 years old, the limit rises to $24,000. Meanwhile traditional and Roth IRAs let people younger than 50 deposit only a maximum of $5,500 a year. If you're older than 50, they let you contribute an additional $1,000. But the amount of annual contributions allowed starts phasing out as your income hits certain levels: above $117,000 for Roths ($184,000 if married and filing a joint tax return). Tax-deferred contributions to traditional IRAs start phasing at various income levels tied to whether you and your spouse are eligible for employer-provided retirement plans.The 401(k) has the potential benefit of a company's matching contribution. A matching contribution means if you put a certain percentage of your salary into the plan, the company will match it. For instance, if the company will match the first 5% of your salary, you should invest at least 5% of your salary.You can boost your contribution as high as the limit, but at a minimum grab all the free money the company is offering. If you manage to max out the 401(k), you can still put money into an IRA, for a total of $23,500, if you're under 50.Between the three, the answer seems obvious. If you are offered a 401(k) plan, for most investors it makes sense to put in as much money as you can afford until you max out your annual allotment.If you can't spare enough to max out the 401(k), ""we recommend saving 15% of your salary, including a company match,"" said Judith Ward, senior financial planner at fund giant T. Rowe Price (TROW).Socking away 15% of your income is seen as the minimum savings needed to ensure maintaining close to your lifestyle through all of your retirement years. Saving less than 15% decreases your chance of building a nest egg that can last.""If you can do more, that's better,"" Ward said. ""One of the things we've found is higher-income workers have to contribute more to maintain their lifestyle in retirement.""According to T. Rowe Price Retirement Plan Services, the average deferral rate among its plan participants was just 7%, less than half the recommended level. And approximately one-third of participants aren't deferring any money to their retirement account. But among employers that are auto-enrolling participants, they have boosted the deferral rate to 6% from 3%.Aside from using them for regular investments, a primary use of IRAs is for rollovers from 401(k) accounts. ""You don't want to leave the 401(k) at the workplace,"" said Mitch Tuchman, managing director of Rebalance IRA, an investment advisory firm in Palo Alto, Calif., with $410 million under management. ""You transfer it into an IRA so you have control over it.""""The main advantage of the 401(k) plan is you just set it and forget it,"" said Rande Spiegelman, vice president of financial planning at Charles Schwab. ""It's a pretax automatic payroll deduction. You don't see it; you don't miss it.""Meanwhile, the IRA can take a bit more effort and discipline. You have to write a check or set up automatic transfers to contribute on a regular basis. Major brokerages, banks and fund companies provide material, calculators and financial advisors to help in choosing which investments — whether stocks, bonds, mutual funds or ETFs — are appropriate for you given your investment time horizon and risk tolerance.IBD'S TAKE: Some 401(k) plans allow investments in individual stocks, but most investors will have to use IRAs. The advantage: Gains are tax-deferred in traditional IRAs and tax-free in Roth IRAs. IBD has useful tools for buying stocks for your IRA portfolio.Target-date mutual funds are growing in popularity. They're geared to match your investment horizon and risk tolerance as you move toward, into and through retirement.Craig Wear prefers the Roth IRA. The founder and chief executive of Active401k (www.My401kInvesting.com), a 401(k) investor advice service in Houston, said the taxes incurred on withdrawals of the IRA and 401(k) can create a big negative for the rest of retirees' lives.

51,TROW,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX) received support from a majority of its lenders to loosen terms on its credit agreement, giving it additional flexibility to tackle its $30 billion debt load. But shares reversed early gains as Valeant faces yet another lawsuit.Under the amendment, the drugmaker will be able to relax a condition that governed a measure of its earnings relative to interest expense, will gain the ability to sell more of its assets, and will be allowed to issue secured bonds with shorter maturities and other debt to repay term loans.The company embarked on the credit-agreement amendment process after affirming an annual forecast that allayed investor concerns. However, some of those fears were rekindled after a report last week that it was the target of a criminal probe by federal prosecutors. The drugmaker needed the approval of more than 50% of the lenders on its roughly $12 billion of loans and revolver to make the revisions.The amendment will lower Valeant's interest coverage covenant to two times. It was supposed to step up to 2.75 times starting in the second quarter. Valeant will pay a one-time amendment fee to lenders of 0.25 percentage point of loans and commitments. It will also boost interest rate margins by 0.5 percentage point.T. Rowe Price Group (TROW) sued Valeant, alleging top executives used a secret network of pharmacies, deceptive pricing, reimbursement practices and accounting tricks to hide its branded drugs from generic competition and artificially inflate revenue and profit.Valeant shares rose as high as as 31.53 on the stock market today, a three-month high. But the stock reversed, trading down 2.2% to 29.33 near midday.Valeant shot up 13% on Wednesday after two stock analysts raised their ratings and issued new price targets this week.

53,TROW,"It's not market shocks like Brexit. It's not because they've been burned by bad advice from financial advisors. It's because they can't afford it.That's the reason cited most often by millennials to explain why they shy away from investing in the stock market, according to a new survey by Bankrate Money Pulse.Just 33% of all millennials invest in stocks, whether directly or through mutual funds or a retirement account.In comparison, 43% of all people surveyed do invest in stocks. Members of Generation X -- who are 36 to 51 years of age -- are the most avid stock investors, with 51% of them holding equities. Baby boomers are close behind, with 48% investing in stocks.But there's a valuable, practical lesson for millennials hidden among the data. Millennials who grow to understand the role that stocks can play in their portfolios are positioned to build much bigger retirement nest eggs.First, look at the millennials who aren't investing in stocks.Forty-six percent of millennials -- who range in age from 18 to 35 -- said lack of money is the reason they don't invest in stocks, making that the most common response.The second-most commonly cited reason was lack of knowledge about stocks, with 25% of the general population laying blame there, and 35% of millennials saying that's why they don't invest in stocks.Investment risk was the third-most commonly cited reason for not investing in stocks by the general population.Stocks outperform other types of securities over the long haul. That's why stocks are the asset class that will make your nest egg grow the most over time. More older millennials than younger millennials understand that, according to Jill Cornfield, Bankrate.com's retirement analyst.""Older millennials seem to be getting the message that the stock market allows for major financial gains if you start early,"" she said in a news release. ""Although there's always some risk involved, building a portfolio at an early age allows for compound interest to grow and produce ample savings over time.""Look at the advantage a worker has if he starts to invest early, using stocks or stock mutual funds. Since 1926, large-cap stocks have gained 10.1% a year on average, through June 30, 2016, according to Morningstar Inc. Cash? It gained 3.4% a year on average. And it's yearly return has been far below an anemic 1% since 2009.That's why you should invest in stocks and stock funds over the long run.Now suppose at age 25 you start to kick in $5,500 each year into a retirement account. Let's say it earns 7% a year on average. That's less than the actual 10.1% historical annual return, so it should be very achievable. By age 65, your nest egg will be worth $1.17 million.What if your twin, who is less farsighted than you are, waits 10 years before starting to stuff money into his IRA? To make up for lost time, he puts in $8,000 a year. He also earns 7% a year. Enough? Nope. By age 65 his account balance will be less than $809,000.That's 31% smaller than your balance, even though your lazy twin had to pony up $240,000 during 30 years -- which is $20,000 more than you put in.Why such a big difference? The power of compounding. That's the key driver that more millennials have to understand. And stocks and stock funds give them the best shot at making the most of compounding.As mutual fund giant T. Rowe Price (TROW) says on its website, ""When time is on your side, your investment has time to grow."" The sooner you start investing, the easier it is for your nest egg to grow, T. Rowe Price says.But many people don't appreciate how powerful compounding can be. How much can it turbocharge your portfolio?Mutual fund and ETF titan Vanguard Group spells it out this way. ""As a rule of thumb, if your investments returned 6% annually, you would double your investment about every 12 years,"" Vanguard said.And it provides an additional benefit. Investing over a longer period also cuts your risk – and risk, or fear of losing money in the market -- is one of the main reasons millennials avoid investing in stocks.Based on the past history of stocks, Vanguard adds, ""if you invested in the stock market for one year, your chance of losing money would be greater than 1 in 4. But if you invested for 10 years, that number would drop to about 1 in 25—and after 20 years, to zero.""So what's keeping you from starting now?

56,TROW,"So far this year, no one has tossed any rhetorical stun grenades at the Morningstar Investment Conference.Last year, keynote speaker Jeremy Grantham -- founder and chief investment strategist of Boston-based Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo -- warned of an emerging bubble in the stock market.Grantham is well-known for identifying speculative market bubbles as they are still taking shape, then taking clients’ assets to the exits before those investors suffer bruising losses. He did that with Japanese stocks in the late 1980s and with technology stocks in the late 1990s.At 2014’s Morningstar conclave, famed bond investor Bill Gross strode onstage for his address wearing sunglasses and introduced himself as a 70-year-old version of controversial pop star Justin Bieber. It was Gross’ way of poking fun at the press criticism he has often attracted. To emphasize his point, he also compared himself to press-beleaguered celebrities such as World War II Gen. George Patton -- whom the wartime press lambasted for slapping a hospitalized soldier -- and current celebrity Kim Kardashian.The closest that this year’s edition of the conference -- its 28th annual gathering -- has come to controversy may have been with the Tuesday panel that discussed high-yield bonds.Panelists Fred Hoff of Fidelity Investments, Michael Hong of Wellington Management and Mark Vaselkiv of T. Rowe Price (TROW) concurred about the virtues of high-yield debt.But two advisors in the audience, who asked not to be named, afterwards told IBD that they would have liked to hear more about the odds of the default rates rising for either corporate or other high-yield debt. One of the advisors noted that he didn’t recall hearing the word “junk” used during the presentation.Still, the panelists said the large research teams in each of their large mutual-fund shops aim to steer their funds away from potential defaults.And risk was addressed. Moderator Sumit Desai kicked off the discussion in part by noting that famed investor Carl Icahn has declared his growing bearishness about high yield. And the average high-yield spread to comparable maturity Treasuries is greater than the norm -- 597 basis points vs. 583 -- suggesting a reversion to the mean is in the cards.The panelists stressed that investing in high yield demands a long time horizon.Vaselkiv said if the apparent stabilization of the price of oil around $45 per barrel holds, the danger of a ripple effect of defaults from the troubled oil patch should recede or at least not grow.

It gained 13 stocks, including utility firms American Water Works (AWK), Entergy (ETR) and Public Service Enterprise (PEG). It also dropped 13 stocks, including T. Rowe Price (TROW) and Pfizer (PFE).SPLV screens for the 100 least volatile stocks in the S&P 500 and gives a bigger weighting to stocks with lower volatility.USMV also offers exposure to U.S. stocks with potentially less risk than the broader market. However, it constrains sector weightings to within a 5% band relative to the parent MSCI USA index.That holds appeal for institutional investors whose mandates and compensations are tied to closely following the benchmarks, according to Kalivas.""Our customers are more nimble advisors"" who are more apt to drift away from the benchmarks, he said.SPLV has no maximum or minimum sector-weight requirements. And that is a good thing, Kalivas argues. For example, the utilities stake in SPLV has varied greatly over the years. It was as high as 32% in 2011, went down to less than 3% in 2015, and is now ""marching back up,"" Kalivas pointed out.Right now, SPLV has no exposure at all to the volatile energy sector.""If a sector comes under stress and has a lot of volatility, you can avoid it (entirely),"" Kalivas said. He cites the financial crisis of 2007-2008 and the earlier tech crisis as periods when SPLV's unconstrained methodology ""would have been a big help."" Neither SPLV nor USMV has a 10-year history.Critics point out that SPLV makes big sector bets in the utilities and consumer staples sectors. This ETF tends to get hit hard when sector or interest-rate risk comes into play.

58,TROW,"Individual investors won some but not all of what was hoped from a sweeping new rule that tightens conflict-of-interest standards for brokers. Those brokers manage trillions of dollars in retirement accounts such as 401(k)s and IRAs, creating compliance headaches and liability issues for the financial industry.Still, the new rules are more lenient than the financial industry had feared they would be. And that leniency led investors to bid up stocks on Wednesday of many asset managers, brokers and insurers.Life insurer Primerica (PRI) soared nearly 7%. Broker and financial adviser Ameriprise Financial (AMP) rose 1.5%. T. Rowe Price (TROW) rose 1.4%. ""Several of these stocks are trading up today,"" said Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren. ""The rule impact is being seen as not as onerous as feared.""Despite industry relief, overall the rule is seen as a victory for individual investors.The final Labor Department (DOL) fiduciary rule, which follows months of public and industry views on its proposal, requires brokers to act in the best interests of clients when providing retirement advice. The Obama administration claims that will lower costs and boost returns for investors.""Today’s rule ensures that putting clients first is no longer a marketing slogan,"" Labor Secretary Thomas Perez said in a conference with reporters. ""It is the law.""The fiduciary standard of behavior creates new grounds for complaints by investors who feel they have been short-changed by their broker. At the outset of a brokerage relationship, a broker can still require a client to agree to take any disputes to arbitration rather than to court. But now the broker has to meet a higher standard of professional behavior, says Andrew Stoltmann, a Chicago securities-fraud attorney.""(The new rule) creates a strengthened cause of action for those suing their brokers,"" Stoltmann said. The new rule does not mean that DOL itself will become more active as a securities cop, Stoltmann added.The government made some concessions in its final rule after months of criticism from the financial industry.The Investment Company Institute, a group representing mutual funds, last summer called the proposal so complicated that it is unworkable. Brokerages charged that the requirement would add costs that make retirement advice unaffordable for many lower- and middle-income investors.Some financial firms will probably benefit, while others are expected to be hurt.Discount brokerages such as Charles Schwab (SCHW) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) stand to be helped, Morningstar predicted. So are companies that sell a lot of index and exchange traded products, like State Street (STT), BlackRock (BLK) and Vanguard. And robo-advisors are also likely to gain business. Brokers would be compelled to use their low-cost products and services rather than high cost alternatives.T. Rowe Price stock was up because its funds are relatively good performers, meaning they are more likely to be acceptable investment recommendations by brokers, Warren said. Also, the firm has been bolstering its sales staff in recent months, to boost its IRA business, he added.In its new rule, the Labor Department addressed some industry concerns. The originally proposed eight-month deadline for compliance is gone, replaced by a longer, ""phased"" implementation timetable.Also modified is a requirement for new clients to sign a contract in which any broker conflicts are disclosed. These would include the broker disclosing that high-commission products might be offered even though lower-cost alternatives are available. The final rule says the contract does not have to be signed until a client actually opens an account. The proposed rule called for the contract to be signed when the client first had contact with a broker.Another item dropped from the final rule: a proposed list of acceptable assets that advisors can recommend instead of certain high-risk investments. And a widely expected prohibition of in-house investment products has been dropped.""I'm a little disappointed the DOL has caved on the issue of whether firms can recommend proprietary products like annuities,"" Stoltmann said. ""No real fiduciary could do this. I think the DOL caved on a very crucial issue.""The new rule basically extends a fiduciary standard mainly to brokers when they provide investment advice for retirement accounts. A fiduciary standard requires brokers to act in the best interests of clients. Registered investment advisors (RIAs) are already subject to the fiduciary standard, but a stricter version than imposed by the new rule on brokers, said Stoltmann.The new rule takes aim at IRAs -- particularly on money that is transferred or rolled over into IRAs from workplace retirement accounts such as 401(k)s, says Skip Schweiss, TD Ameritrade head of investor advocacy.Under the old rule, brokers could recommend investments that were merely suitable for clients. The DOL says that the old standard allowed brokers to base recommendations on what would generate commissions for them, even if a better-performing, lower-cost investment was available.The White House -- which supports the tighter standard -- said in February 2015 that investments made on the basis of conflicted advice under the old rule returned roughly 1 percentage point less a year on average than investments made on the advice of fiduciaries.With an estimated $1.7 trillion of IRA assets invested in the type of products that generate conflicts of interest, the White House estimated that the aggregate annual cost of conflicted advice is about $17 billion.""A retiree who receives conflicted advice when rolling over a 401(k) balance to an IRA at retirement will lose an estimated 12% of the value of his or her savings if drawn down over 30 years,"" read the White House report. ""If a retiree receiving conflicted advice takes withdrawals at the rate possible absent conflicted advice, his or her savings would run out more than five years earlier.""With a $100,000 rollover for people age 55 to 64 in 2012, a 12% loss would cost the average investor $12,000.Morningstar forecast a mixed impact for active asset managers, including AllianceBernstein (AB), Cohen & Steers (CNS), Eaton Vance (EV), Federated (FII), Janus Capital Group (JNS) and Legg Mason (LM). The same applies to full-service wealth managers, including Bank of America (BAC), Morgan Stanley (MS), Raymond James (RJF) and Wells Fargo (WFC).These companies have product lineups that include both higher and lower cost products.And some impact could differ from what's expected. Many full-service brokerages could replace commission-based IRA fund sales with IRAs that generate fees on assets. ""As fee-based accounts can have a revenue yield upwards of 60% higher than commission-based, this could translate to as much as an additional $13 billion of revenue for the industry,"" Morningstar reported.Also, full-service wealth managers could stop serving clients with low IRA account balances. Those clients could take an estimated $250 billion to $600 billion in assets to robo-advisors. That could push a number of robo-advisors above the $16 billion to $40 billion asset base that Morningstar estimated they need to become profitable.Even within groups that could be hurt by the new rule, like active asset managers and insurers, some companies could benefit. ""(Firms) with moats will gain market share from their less competitively advantaged peers or ... will be able to adjust their business model to offset the negative financial effects of the rule,"" Morningstar reported.

59,TROW,"The financial services industry breathed a sigh of relief when the Department of Labor (DOL) issued its new rule last week. That rule aims to shield individual investors from retirement plan advice by brokers who put their own profits ahead of their clients' financial interests.The sigh of relief was because the DOL's new restrictions on brokers' conflicts of interest was less onerous than the industry had expected. The DOL imposed a fiduciary standard, but provided exemptions and a slower implementation timetable.Still, the industry does stand to feel a megabuck impact. The rule could fuel as much as trillions of dollars in client asset shifts -- mainly from high-cost actively managed mutual funds -- with hefty losses of fees and commissions. It will also likely impose billions of dollars in upfront and subsequent annual compliance costs.In the $23 trillion U.S. retirement market, much of that impact will be in the $7.3 trillion IRA market, says a new report by Goldman Sachs. About $5 trillion of that will not be affected by the new rule. That's because that money was already subject to the fiduciary rule or is in self-directed accounts that don't use a financial advisor's recommendations or for some other reason, Goldman says.That leaves about $2.2 trillion in mutual funds where advisor-aided buy-sell decisions could change due to the new rule. And financial firms could be hurt by the loss of sales commissions -- also known as loads -- as well as by the loss of annual fees, as shareholder investments into those accounts slow or as assets are shifted into other, lower-cost types of assets such as index funds and ETFs, Goldman says.Mutual fund front-end loads -- commission paid when the fund is bought -- range from 0.50% to 5.75% of the value of the shares purchased, Morningstar Inc. says. Deferred loads, -- paid when shares are sold -- range from 1% to 4%.The average annual expense ratio, or percent of assets paid by the shareholder to the fund manager, is 1.18%. Stock funds bear an average annual cost of 1.25%. Bond-fund shareholders pay 0.96% on average.At 1.18%, $2.2 trillion in at-risk IRA assets would generate $39.6 billion in annual fees alone.Shareholders have been shifting to no-load share classes for years, says the Investment Company Institute, an industry group.And shareholders are already voting with their wallets against what is perceived to be higher cost mutual funds. Those $2 trillion in retail mutual funds that generate brokerage commissions account for 20% of active mutual fund assets under management. That's down from a 37% share in 2007.And where are those assets going? Individual investors are not putting them under their mattresses. They're shifting them into lower-fee ETFs and index mutual funds. Boosted by this rotation, ETF assets could mushroom to $7 trillion globally by 2020, up from $2.8 trillion today, Goldman says.In addition, the industry will also be hit by compliance costs: costs of revamping procedures to comply with the new rule, costs of retraining staff. Goldman says annual compliance costs will be more than $13 billion in upfront costs and more than $7 billion in annual costs.Retail brokers, asset managers and life insurers face swirling crosswinds of benefits and financial harm as shareholders shift existing assets and shift future asset allocation strategies, Goldman warns.""We see discount brokers like SCHW, AMTD and ETFC as relative gainers, likely gaining share as FAs"" -- financial advisors -- ""seek new platforms built for a fiduciary world and smaller accounts migrate to self-directed IRAs (and/or) auto-advisors,"" a Goldman report readers, referring to publicly traded brokerages Charles Schwab (SCHW), TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and E-Trade Financial (ETFC).""Furthermore, we believe the end result will likely be further pressure on fees, accelerating the shift to ETFs/passive (mutual funds),"" Goldman's report added, citing iShares and PowerShares parent asset managers BlackRock (BLK) and Invesco (IVZ) as likely beneficiaries. State Street (STT) and WisdomTree Investments (WETF) should also benefit.In addition, Goldman predicts that rollovers to IRAs from 401(k)s by retirees will slow. Because that process will be subject to the fiduciary rule, brokers will simply avoid it. Instead, financial advisors may advise their clients to leave assets in their 401(k) accounts. That should help a fund family like T. Rowe Price (TROW), Goldman says. T. Rowe Price does much more business running 401(k) accounts than it does as an IRA custodian, according to Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren.The largest players in the 401(k) business should gain, Goldman says. Among publicly traded companies, that includes BlackRock, State Street, Prudential Financial (PRU), Northern Trust (NTRS), Principal Financial Group (PFG) and Bank of New York Mellon (BK).T. Rowe Price and AllianceBernstein (AB) are also positioned to gain market share in the target-date fund business.Image provided by Shutterstock.

60,TROW,"According to Forrester Research (FORR), 80% of companies say that they deliver exceptional customer service. The problem is, only a scant 8% of their customers agree.Those stats come from Jay Baer, author of “Hug Your Haters: How to Embrace Complaints and Keep Your Customers.”As Strother Martin’s character famously said in the movie “Cool Hand Luke,” “What we have here is failure to communicate.”Baer, who is president of Convince & Convert, an online customer service and digital marketing consultancy/media company, goes on to say that organizations ignore one-third of customer complaints, most of them in online, public venues. That's a mistake, he said: “Haters are the most important customers, but they are treated as the least important. Haters aren’t your problem; ignoring them is.”Tips on turning complaints into satisfied and loyal patrons:Engage banter. Baer doesn’t mince words: “Answer every customer complaint, in every channel, every time.”He notes that each time you do, customer advocacy increases up to 25%, according to the research conducted for his book. Also, interact with customers in the venues they prefer, not the ones the business finds convenient.Baer says that only 5% of unhappy customers ever complain, and they “are vital because they go out of their way to tell the company what it needs to do better. Complaints are the petri dish of improvement.”They also might be the tips of a larger iceberg. Those who don’t complain may just stop buying from your company.You reply only twice. The most important lesson for handling online complaints, Baer states, is “you never, ever, ever respond more than two times to any customer in a public, online venue.”His reasoning: If a customer has a positive comment, two replies is more than sufficient. “In the more likely scenario of negative feedback, when you encounter a ranting and raving customer, reply twice with an apology and a remediation option. Then just walk away.”Recognize patron feelings. Liz H. Kelly, a marketing consultant who was a vice president of training and quality for T. Rowe Price (TROW), says that it’s imperative that customer service reps “acknowledge when someone is upset.” Instead of being defensive with an angry customer, “the most important thing to do is acknowledge their emotion first. You can usually diffuse someone’s anger by simply saying, 'I understand your frustration’ or 'We are sorry you had a bad experience and want to get your issue resolved right away.’ You don’t have to agree with them, but you do have to acknowledge their frustration.”Right from the get-go, make sure that an angry customer believes you are on his team. By doing so, she said, “you will significantly increase your chances of not only keeping the customer but turning them into a loyal supporter.”Accelerate response times. Forty percent of customers who complain in social media expect a reply within one hour, Baer relays.A firm that replies that fast, Kelly said, “rebuilds trust and minimizes damage to their reputation. AT&T (T) and DirecTV are among many brands who now have dedicated customer service teams who deal with complaints on social media.”Consider that the average time it takes a company to reply to an email is 44 hours. “This is too slow, and in many cases a sluggish email response causes customers to assume they will not hear back at all, so they then complain online, in public,” Baer said.As for the telephone, consumers say that response time is the most important factor in their satisfaction with customer service.See the big picture. Customer service is becoming a spectator sport, Baer points out, because “every time you interact with a customer in an online, public venue like Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR), review sites or forums, you are displaying for hundreds or thousands of onlookers the values of your business.”Kelly adds that because customers look online first before making a purchase, brands must learn to hug their haters on social media.Baer cautions that’s why it’s so dangerous to ignore online complaints: “After all, no reply IS a reply that says, 'We don’t care about our customers.’ ”Image provided by Shutterstock.

61,TROW,"For many people, contemplating how much money you'll need in retirement is as pleasant as thinking about your mortality. However, not thinking about it is a surefire way to guarantee your retirement won't be everything you want it to be.Are you like most people? According to the 2016 Retirement Confidence Survey, 21% of workers are very confident they will have enough money to live comfortably throughout their retirement years, 42% say they are somewhat confident, and 19% are not at all confident.The survey was released in March by the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI).Click Here To See Full Special ReportTo improve your confidence in your retirement, make sure you're on the right track. The best way to start preparing for a comfortable retirement is jump off the cliff and then build your wings on the way down. Or to put it less figuratively than author Ray Bradbury's adage, start saving first and then figure out how much you'll need.The saving part comes first because it might take you a while to stop procrastinating and start crunching the numbers. For many, wrestling with the math is daunting. But in truth, getting a ballpark figure on how much you'll need has never been easier, thanks to the advent of the online retirement calculator.""The days of saving $1 million and you're fine don’t work anymore,"" said Michael Pellegrino, a principal with Goldstone Financial Group, an independent advisor in Oakbrook, Ill., with $600 million under management. ""The old adage of 80% of your income isn't adequate anymore. We find that about 80% of people who come in are used to a certain lifestyle, and what they want is to have that lifestyle continue.""Fewer than half of those surveyed, 48%, said they've tried to calculate how much money they'll need to save in order to  live comfortably in retirement. The likelihood of doing such a calculation increases with household income, education and financial assets. Those that have tried a calculation are more likely to already have retirement savings.To figure out their retirement needs, about 36% of workers just guessed, said the survey, while 26% did their own estimate, 22% asked a financial advisor, 10% used an online calculator, and 6% used a worksheet.One problem with an online retirement calculator, in which you punch in your relevant numbers, is that you get different results with each one. If you're not already scared into inaction, this could do it. But don't freeze.""Just going through the process of using a calculator can give an idea of how much money you need,"" said Stuart Ritter, senior financial planner with T. Rowe Price (TROW). ""Even if they give different answers, it gives you a ball park figure of how much you need, and surveys consistently show that people underestimate their needs.""The EBRI has a calculator at choosetosave.org, and the Treasury Department has one at myra.gov. Most mutual fund and ETF companies and brokerages have their own.Ritter said if you’re underfunded, the best thing to do is work longer, which gives you five bonuses: 1) you get to save more, 2) you get more years of potential growth, 3) your money has to last fewer years, 4) you get to delay Social Security benefits, which gives you a bigger check for the rest of your life, and 5) you can continue using your employer’s benefits -- otherwise you pay for medical insurance on your own.""Most people think they will work longer than they actually do, especially if they have a physically demanding job,"" said Nevin E. Adams, chief of marketing and communications at the American Retirement Association. ""Still, it's best to devise an effective strategy to not claim Social Security before you turn 70, so as to claim the maximum benefit.""The two biggest drivers that affect your success at having enough for retirement are how much you save before retirement and how much you spend when you stop working. Fortunately, they are both within your control.To save more money, you also need to spend less now. The benefit is twofold: In addition to having more in your retirement account, you've adjusted your lifestyle to live on less. This means the amount of money needed to replace this new lifestyle is lower.If you're 50 or older, some retirement plans such as 401(k), 403(b), 457 plans, and IRAs, allow you to make larger ""catch-up"" contributions. For instance, in a 401(k) plan you can make an additional $6,000 pretax contribution on top of the regular $18,000 contribution.""A lot of people have a misconception that there is a figure that you need. It's really how much income do you need to live a certain lifestyle,"" said John Jamieson, president of wealth strategy firm Perpetual Wealth Systems and author of ""Wealth Without Stocks or Mutual Funds."" ""It's not just your income, but also your expenses.""You should enter retirement with very little personal debt and your house paid for, said Jamieson. By not having a mortgage payment, you need that much less money to sustain the same lifestyle.Jamieson also recommends a fixed index annuity with a guaranteed lifetime income rider. These products allow you to profit when stock markets rise, but they protect against losses when the market falls.

62,TROW,"You're coming up on 62 years old, you've worked hard and paid Social Security taxes for years. On top of that, your family doesn't have a very good record of longevity, so you figure you'll retire now and enjoy life and a comfortable retirement while you still have your health.But before you begin receiving Social Security benefits, you may want to consider the following: Would you be better off retiring early and receiving smaller monthly payments, or retiring later and receiving larger monthly payments?The answer could be worth tens of thousands of dollars.But deciding whether to retire at 62, or at the full retirement age of between 65 and 67, or at the maximum age of 70, depends on a wide range of factors. These include your current and future cash needs, your health and family longevity, future income expectations and your marital status.""If you find your health is not strong and you’re single, maybe you should turn it (Social Security benefits) on sooner,"" said Joshua Mellberg, president of J.D. Mellberg Financial in Tucson, Ariz., which offers clients a wide array of retirement products and services.Click Here To See Full Special ReportBut it's important to know that the amount you receive when you start taking benefits sets the baseline for the benefits you’ll get for the rest of your life.Those who start receiving Social Security checks at age 62 will receive lower monthly payments for a longer period of time, but they'll forego increases of about 7% to 8% every year until they reach the maximum retirement age of 70. Those increases, plus annual cost-of-living adjustments, can significantly boost annual Social Security income for those who wait.""If you wait until 70, your benefit could go up about 70%"" compared with if you starting taking benefits at 62, said Judith Ward, senior financial planner and vice president of T. Rowe Price (TROW) Investment Services. ""If you still plan to work, we would suggest people wait until their full retirement age or older,"" she said.Brett King, senior vice president of investments for Elite Financial Associates in Tampa, Fla., said health, job and other factors could prevent some people from delaying retirement. Otherwise, he agreed that it's best to wait as long as possible, because the increase in benefits you would get each year are hard to beat. ""There’s nothing out there that guarantees you an 8% return,"" he said.Meanwhile, Ward said married couples should plan for retirement jointly rather than independently, because the surviving spouse will get only one check after their partner dies. Since Social Security benefits are based on earnings averaged over most of a worker's lifetime, it makes more sense for the highest-earning spouse to wait as long as possible before receiving benefits.""It’s a good idea to maximize that check,"" she said, adding that wives tend to outlive their husbands and may be dependent on that income when the husband passes away.The Social Security Administration sends a yearly statement to everyone age 25 or older who has paid Social Security taxes and has not yet received benefits. You can go to www.ssa.gov to set up an account, look up your work history and use a calculator to view your estimated benefits at age 62, at the full retirement age and at age 70.Those nearing retirement should also consider that life expectancy has been increasing due to advances in medicine. The average 65-year-old today can expect to live well into their 80s. About 1 out of every 4 will live past age 90, and 1 out of 10 will live past 95, the Social Security Administration says.""Life expectancy is much longer than it was,"" Mellberg said. ""The 70s are the new 50s.""Meanwhile, those who served in the military or held another job that paid a pension but didn't pay Social Security taxes should check on what benefits may be available to them.The Social Security Administration warns that by 2034 the payroll taxes collected will be enough to pay only about 79 cents for each dollar of scheduled benefits.Experts said they expect the Social Security system will survive, but changes will have to be made to make it more sustainable. That could result in reduced benefits or higher taxes, which are among many other factors to consider in deciding when to start taking Social Security payments.""Given the deficits in Social Security and Medicare, you have to think about the likelihood of taxes going up,"" Mellberg said. ""You have to think of maintaining the same purchasing power"" that you had prior to retiring.

63,TROW,"Even for the beleaguered shareholders of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX), Monday was an unusually bad day.The company’s biggest owner, investment firm Ruane Cunniff & Goldfarb, lost an estimated $525 million after shares of the drugmaker fell more than 18% Monday, the biggest decline since October, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. T. Rowe Price Group Inc. (TROW) had a one-day drop of about $324 million, and William Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management gave up $321 million on the common stock it owns. The estimates assume the investors still own the number of shares listed in their most recent regulatory filings.Valeant tumbled after the company withdrew a financial forecast, delayed the release of fourth-quarter results and confirmed a previously undisclosed probe by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that came to light after media inquiries. Valeant, which has been under scrutiny for its soaring drug prices, accounting and distribution practices, is down roughly 75% since its August peak and off 35% in 2016 through Monday.The latest drama at Valeant began on Sunday night, when the company announced that Chief Executive Officer Michael Pearson would give up his chairman title and return after a two-month medical leave.""We are delighted that Mike’s health has recovered and he has returned as CEO so that he can now work on behalf of the company and shareholders,"" Ackman said in a statement Monday to CNBC. Ackman said he expected that much of the uncertainty surrounding the company would be resolved in the ""relative short term.""ValueAct Management, an activist investment firm, lost about $223 million on Valeant shares on Monday, and hedge fund firm Paulson & Co. was down $198 million.Many of the largest shareholders, including Ruane Cunniff, T. Rowe Price and Paulson, added to their holdings of Valeant in the fourth quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Pershing Square increased its stake this year. Its loss on Valeant doesn’t include declines it may have had on options it owns.Ruane Cunniff is best-known for its $6.2 billion Sequoia Fund. The fund, which has had stellar performance since its creation in 1970, trailed 87% of peers last year, and 76% this year, as a result of the Valeant stake. The shares accounted for 25% of the fund as of Sept. 30.Messages seeking comment to Ruane Cunniff, ValueAct and Paulson were not immediately returned. A spokesman for T. Rowe Price declined to comment for this story. Pershing Square spokesman Francis McGill declined to comment beyond Ackman’s statement.

64,TROW,"Special Report: Personal Finance Action Plan For 2016ETFs are investing sledgehammers, opening up wide swathes of global regions or asset classes in one fell blow. They're equally precision tools, allowing investors to make tactical sector bets, to equitize cash or to hedge against market declines.That malleable quality is a key reason why exchange traded funds continue to blast their way into investors' strategies.Perhaps you're hearing about ETFs for the first time. Or maybe you're fine-tuning your financial action plan for 2016. As you check on your investing progress last year or prime your portfolio for the new one, ETFs are certainly worth considering.The numbers speak for themselves.More than $201 billion in new money flowed into U.S. ETFs and exchange-traded products in the first 11 months of 2015, according to independent research firm ETFGI.com.That's up 5% from last year's record asset-gathering pace for the same period.Unsurprisingly, more and more money managers want to get in on the ETF game, says Matt Hougan, CEO of ETF.com.""That trend has absolutely accelerated this year,"" he told IBD. ""It's actually breathtaking in its scope.""Goldman Sachs and John Hancock in October launched their first ETF products that aim to beat traditional indexes. Oppenheimer Funds, New York Life Investment Management and Janus Capital Group (JNS) bought out small ETF shops. T. Rowe Price (TROW) and Legg Mason (LM) have filed for the regulatory nod to offer ETFs. A unit of Eaton Vance (EV) plans to introduce a newfangled, hybrid ETF-mutual fund product.Hougan describes the trend as a matter of simple math. From 2009 to 2015, investors poured roughly $1.1 trillion in net new money into ETFs, while mutual funds absorbed $200 billion.""If you're the director at any major mutual fund company, you have to wake up every day asking yourself why,"" he said.Best-Performing ETFs Of 2015Investors scored big wins last year from small ETFs tapping into niche market segments.Market Vectors China AMC (CNXT) and Deutsche X-trackers Harvest CSI 500 (ASHS) rocketed 43% and 28%, respectively.Both hold small-cap China A shares, listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. Until quite recently, these equities could only be bought by Chinese citizens.Many successful investors also tapped into the potential of narrowly focused technology ETFs.First Trust Dow Jones Internet (FDN) soared 22% in 2015.KraneShares CSI China Internet (KWEB) jumped 18%.FDN has massive stakes in IBD Leaderboard stocks Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN).Online retailer Amazon was a standout stock of 2015, more than doubling in price as it reinvents itself as a powerhouse in cloud computing and on-demand video streaming.Meanwhile, KWEB holds Chinese giants Alibaba (BABA), Baidu (BIDU) and JD.com (JD).The ETF also has smaller companies with stellar IBD ratings such as NetEase (NTES), Qihoo 360 (QIHU) and TAL Education (XRS).Investors did much better with large-cap ETFs last year than with small-cap peers.Several winners are ""smart beta"" ETFs, which aim to outperform traditional benchmarks.Among them, iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor (MTUM), iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor (QUAL) and iShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility (USMV) withstood a choppy and challenging year for the stock market.The trio leaped 9%, 6% and 6%, respectively.By comparison, traditional, cap-weighted ETFs tracking the S&P 500 index advanced 1%.International ETFs got beat up in 2015.The iShares MSCI EAFE (EFA), holding developed market stocks, shed 1%. The iShares Emerging Markets (EEM) sank 16%.Outlook And PositioningExpect smart beta products to continue to find their way into investors' ETF strategies in 2016.A recent BlackRock (BLK) iShares report on institutional investors' use of ETFs found 19% of respondents were likely to use smart beta ETFs this year.Only 10% reported allocating to the asset class in 2015.Volatility was the main concern for investors, the report found.Smart beta ETFs can be an effective way to manage volatility, says Heidi Richardson, head of U.S. investment strategy for iShares.These strategies rejigger the traditional rules of index investing to boost returns or reduce risk.Rather than weighting holdings by market capitalization, smart beta ETFs select and weight stocks using alternative methods.For example, iShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility ETF holds stocks with less downside risk.And iShares MSCI Quality Factor ETF aims to enhance returns — it holds U.S. stocks with high return on equity, stable earnings growth and low levels of debt.Investors could ""pair the two"" for better risk-adjusted returns, while getting broad exposure to the U.S. stock market, Richardson told IBD in a phone call.In contrast, an S&P 500-tracking ETF would match the returns of the broad market with the same amount of volatility.The iShares report also found investors are using ETFs in almost equal measure for tactical bets and strategic allocations.An ETF such as iShares Core S&P 500 (IVV) could serve as the foundation of one's portfolio, Richardson said.IVV basically replicates the broad market for a razor-thin 0.07% expense ratio. That's $7 in annual fees for every $10,000 invested.Then investors could get more tactical with ETFs, Richardson added.With interest rates set to rise in steps in 2016, cyclical sectors such as financial services and technology may hold better opportunities.Many tech companies, such as Apple (AAPL), are flush with cash. As a result, they are less vulnerable to increasing rates than, say, debt-loaded utilities.They can continue to roll out shareholder-friendly M&As, share buybacks and dividends.Unlike some peers, iShares U.S. Technology (IYW) is a pure-play technology ETF with almost no exposure to indebted telecom firms.Financial firms such as Wells Fargo (WFC) also benefit from rising rates. They're able to charge clients more on loans, boosting net interest margins.Investors could also consider overweighting positions in Japan and Europe as those countries stimulate their economies, Richardson said.""You can make an active decision about where the market is going to go to generate alpha,"" she added.Fixed-income investors may want to consider defined maturity bond ETFs, short duration ETFs and bond-laddering ETF investing strategies.""They hold attractive opportunities"" in a rising rate environment if you can live with some volatility, Bill Belden, managing director at Guggenheim Investments, said during a Dec. 18 media call.

65,TROW,"The story for online travel in 2016 is consolidation. As it stands, Priceline and Expedia control more than two-thirds of the market, show no signs of giving up the gains and, if anything, will continue to gobble up more small firms — it's impossible for the tiny companies to compete with either of the giants, according to analysts. But Priceline's…
"
66,TROW,"Airbnb is a fast-emerging travel accommodations disrupter valued at $25 billion — but it had a humble beginning. When co-founders Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia couldn't pay their San Francisco rent, they bought three air mattresses and launched a website to rent each mattress for $80 a night. When they found takers, the proverbial light bulb went off.The company runs a website where traveler ""hosts"" rent their homes and apartments — or rooms in their homes and apartments — to travelers for short stays of usually a month or less. Airbnb generated Q3 revenue of $340 million on bookings of $2.2 billion, according to a presentation to investors leaked to the Wall Street Journal.The company is losing some $150 million a year, reported the WSJ, but it's also nipping at the heals of online travel agencies (OTAs) such as Expedia (EXPE) and Priceline (PCLN), upending hotel chains such as Hilton (HLT) and Marriott (MAR) and helping establish a regulatory beachhead in the 34,000 cities where it boasts listings, which could also help rivals such as HomeAway (AWAY).""The online travel agencies and (Priceline's) Bookings.com in particular have said they are happy to let Airbnb blaze the (regulatory) trail and bear a lot of those costs,"" Douglas Quinby, an analyst with online travel research firm Phocuswright, told IBD. ""The big OTAs see opportunities, but they would prefer to let Airbnb drive the regulations.""Airbnb's staunchly Democratic home city of San Francisco has been a battlefield for crafting regulations for Airbnb and similar businesses. Those regulations include requiring such firms to pay hotel taxes and limiting how long hosts can rent out their homes or apartments.Critics have hammered on the company's strategy of begging for forgivingness vs. asking for permission, meaning they start up operations in a city and only respond to concerns as they surface.But the company notched a big win in a November election, when San Francisco voters resoundingly rejected Proposition F, a restrictive measure that, among other provisions, would force Airbnb to provide a quarterly report saying how many days hosts had listed their properties for rent. Prop F would have limited that 75 days a year, and make violations a misdemeanor.After the dust settled, with Airbnb spending $8 million to defeat the item, the question remains: What does the vote mean for Airbnb and the travel industry?""On the one hand, it's an important win in a key market — the birthplace of Airbnb,"" Quinby said. ""On the other hand, it's kind of meaningless because regulations are all being decided on a local level. And there's no reason to think that because San Francisco does one thing, someone else wouldn't do another.""OTAs Say Impact 'Immaterial'On Oct. 29, Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshaki brushed off Airbnb's impact on his company, speaking on Expedia's earnings conference call. Less than a week later, Expedia announced an agreement to acquire the closest thing Airbnb has to a competitor in public markets: HomeAway. Unlike Airbnb, HomeAway's focus is more tightly centered around renting out entire homes for long vacations. HomeAway, founded in 2005, is valued near $3.48 billion and is expected to end the year with revenue of $500 million. But unlike Airbnb, HomeAway makes money. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimate it will end 2015 with an operating profit of $102.5 million.Expedia decline to comment for this story.""It's disingenuous to say that (Airbnb is) not having an impact,"" T. Rowe Price (TROW) portfolio manager Joe Fath told IBD. ""I tend to pay attention to what companies do, instead of what they say.""Fath manages T. Rowe Price's Growth Stock Fund .The fund bought private stock in Airbnb more than two years ago and has hiked its stake's value some 150% since then. Fath is looking for a ""home run"" from Airbnb. ""Supply is Airbnb's biggest constraint,"" he said.Analyst Quinby agrees.""Without question Airbnb has been a phenomenon in the travel industry over the last several years,"" he said. ""They've created an entirely new category in the travel industry. In 2011, 10% of U.S. travelers stayed in private accommodations. In 2014, that number was up to 25%.""For a second straight year, an RBC Capital Markets survey found that one-third of respondents said they have used some form of alternative accommodations, such as Airbnb or HomeAway subsidiary VRBO.One of Fath's largest holdings is Priceline, which he acknowledged hasn't been performing that well in the last 12 months. But he expects the stock will perform better.Also, Priceline is ""well hedged"" against Airbnb and similar firms because of its growing inventory of alternative lodgings, says RBC analyst Mark Mahaney. In a recent research note, he said Priceline's inventory of 361,000 properties is up 80% over the past year.Hyper-Local Regulations BattleThe regulations fight for short-term rentals is hyper local. The hotels and short-term rentals field isn't regulated federally and there are few state laws, so companies must work with each municipality. But while the impact of the San Francisco vote was geographically limited, it was closely watched because of the precedent it would set.Airbnb ""needed to fight this because ... if Proposition F passed, it would have stymied their ability to do business,"" Ed Zitron, an SF-based tech public relations executive uninvolved in the Prop F election, told IBD. ""A defeat would have ... scared investors.""The Airbnb win was a loss for the hotel industry, which led the fight to pass the measure. Still, the benefit of Prop F is that a lot of issues got aired ""in a public forum,"" Troy Flanagan, vice president of state and local affairs for the American Hotel and Lodging Association, told IBD. ""This is one of the first times, if not the first time, such a comprehensive proposal for online, modern short-term rentals was floated. It was a public, open debate in the hometown of Airbnb.""People renting out multiple units are hoteliers, but they aren't being held to the same standards (as hoteliers).""Airbnb, in fact, says it currently collects taxes only in 24 cities in two states, according to a spokesman.When IBD asked Airbnb what the stakes were in the Prop F vote, company spokesman Christopher Nulty wrote in an email that ""Proposition F was a hotel-funded campaign attempting to scare San Franciscans into believing this measure would do a single thing to address affordability in San Francisco. We remain committed to working with policymakers across the country and around the globe to develop smart, common sense regulations that allow regular people to share their homes while contributing to their communities.""Airbnb declined to make any executive available for this story. But CEO Chesky told Re/Code that losing the S.F. vote would have hurt. ""... You can win 10 cities in Europe but you lose your home city and it basically just seems like you're losing ground completely,"" Re/Code quoted Chesky saying. ""We have 130,000 members (hosts and guests) in San Francisco. They ended up winning the ballot, not us. I used to say they're on the ballot, not us. Because we're going to be in 33,999 cities and they're the ones really at stake here, for us it's more of a brand issue.""Affordable housing is a huge issue in San Francisco and the greater Bay Area amid skyrocketing rents and home prices, so renting out a room can help a homeowner.HomeAway says its preferred tactic is to train property owners and managers to lobby their city governments, rather than get embroiled in a Prop F-type election.""That's our traditional path,"" Matt Curtis, HomeAway's director of government relations, told IBD. ""We don't do campaign donations.""Curtis agrees with Airbnb that Prop F was too restrictive, and he says HomeAway wants to ensure ""fair and effective"" regulations in cities where the company operates.""Communities that have chosen to make burdensome restrictions have driven short-term rental activity underground,"" Curtis said. So, those businesses are ""not paying taxes, operating outside the existing framework.""

105,TROW,"In recent years, T.

Making the list takes 25 consecutive years of dividend increases. Through 2012, T. Rowe was at the 26-year mark.Recent dividend increases have been generous — 8% in 2010, 14.8% in 2011 and 9.7% last year.In December, the company paid a special dividend of $1 a share. When the special dividend was announced, CEO James A.C. Kennedy said the special dividend ""should not impact the company's ability to continue our outstanding dividend record.""T. Rowe Price's earnings have been on the rebound.After recession-related earnings declines in 2008-'09, earnings grew 45% in 2010, 15% in 2011 and are expected to have grown 16% in 2012. The results for 2012 will be released Jan. 29.The five-year earnings Stability Factor is 20 on a gauge that runs from 0 (calm) to 99 (wild).Revenue increased 26% and 16% in 2010-'11. The Street expects about 11% in 2012.The company is without debt, yet return on equity was about 23% last year. Debt artificially increases ROE, so 23% is a very good percentage. Top stocks generally have an ROE of 17% or higher.After-tax margin was about 32% in Q3, the highest in at least 17 quarters.The industry group also is fairly strong. As of Wednesday's IBD, the Finance-Investment Management industry group was No. 34 among 197 groups.Clients outside the U.S. account for about 10% of assets under management.Risk factors include government regulation, which can and does impose costs. In recent years, the industry has had to deal with Sarbanes-Oxley, Dodd-Frank and the Volcker Rule. The Volcker Rule could push T. Rowe to dump its savings bank subsidiary. However, T.

119,TROW,"If you're looking for stocks that provide a dividend, growth potential and steadier action, the IBD Big Cap 20 is worth checking out.The latest lineup, which appeared in Tuesday's IBD, offers a few stocks that fit the bill.They include BlackRock (BLK) and T. Rowe Price (TROW) — featured in this column on Jan. 24 and Tuesday, respectively — as well as Motorola Solutions (MSI).Motorola, one of the nation's oldest technology companies, changed its name to Motorola Solutions in 2011 while spinning off its mobile phone and set-top box operations as Motorola Mobility, now part of Google (GOOG).Schaumburg, Ill.-based Motorola Solutions makes telecom equipment that ranges from two-way radios to bar-code scanners, selling the gear to businesses and government agencies. It has billed itself as the ""worldwide leader in mission-critical and business-critical applications.""The company has delivered three straight quarters of big growth in EPS, with gains of 30%, 27% and 26%. Its quarterly revenue increases have been more modest, coming in between 3% and 8% over the past three quarters.Motorola Solutions sports a strong up-down volume ratio and a B+ for its IBD Accumulation/Distribution Rating — signaling that some big investors are buying shares. However, throughout 2012, the number of U.S. mutual and hedge funds with a stake stayed flat or even declined.In terms of chart action, Motorola Solutions is somewhat extended after rallying off support at its 10-week moving average in late January, when the company posted its latest quarterly results.You also could view the stock as still in a possible buying range after etching a three-weeks-tight pattern with a buy point at 59.58. But note that volume wasn't as strong as you generally want to see with a breakout. Also, the stock tends to trade calmly, which makes the tight formation less distinctive.Motorola Solutions pays a quarterly dividend of 26 cents per share, having raised its payout last year from 22 cents per share. That works out to an annualized yield of about 1.8%.

121,TROW,"Affiliated Managers (AMG) reported fourth-quarter earnings that topped estimates on Tuesday as emerging market stocks continued to be popular with institutional clients. Waddell & Reed Financial (WDR) said its Q4 earnings and revenue beat expectations. Affiliated Managers said earnings jumped 45% to $2.55 per share, topping analyst estimates of $2.43. Revenue rose 22% to $491 million, under views of $528.2…
"
122,TROW,"One way to identify tail winds in the U.S. economy is to look at which stocks are topping Q4 estimates by solid margins.The market likes it when a company proves the pessimists wrong. Several companies in the financial or bank sectors recently surprised on the upside.Among Big Cap 20 stocks, Goldman Sachs (GS) delivered a savage beating to the Street's views. The consensus estimate expected earnings of $3.78 a share in Q4.When Goldman reported about two weeks ago, EPS came in 48% higher, or $5.60. Revenue rose 39%. And after-tax margin was 26%, the highest in three years.Return on equity was 11%, up from 6% in 2011.IBD research says history's best stocks generally have ROE of 17% or better. The last time Goldman consistently did that was in 2004-07.At the earnings call Jan. 16, Harvey Schwartz, global co-head of the securities division, said the ROE improvement was the result of managing expenses. ""It's not particularly aspirational,"" he said. ""We'd like to do better.""The general tone of Goldman executives was cautious. Schwartz said, ""Maybe we're in the sixth inning in terms of capital-rule visibility.""Schwartz added that ""as we get more clarity on rule certainty, it may ultimately impact client activity to the positive.""Goldman has a Composite Rating of 96, putting it in the top 4% of the stocks in IBD's database. The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number.On Monday, Bloomberg news reported that Goldman Sachs is seeking to sell a $1 billion stake in Industrial & Commercial Bank of China. The move could be partly related to the capital ratio requirements of Basel III. Goldman is considering selling its reinsurance business because of regulatory rules.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) topped the Street's Q4 earnings number by 19.8%. The 54% EPS growth on a year-ago basis was the best in seven quarters.The stock's up-down volume ratio is 1.6 — far above the 1.0 neutral level.The Composite Rating is 94.T. Rowe Price Group (TROW) posted Q3 earnings growth that was 11.9% above expectations. Fourth-quarter results will be released Tuesday.The Street expects fourth-quarter EPS to rise 22% on a year-ago basis. Revenue will jump 19%, according to the consensus view.The company is considering selling its savings bank subsidiary because of the Volcker rule.T. Rowe's Composite Rating is 95.BlackRock (BLK) topped the Street's consensus EPS number for the fourth quarter by 6.2%.Revenue rose 14%, the first quarter of double-digit growth since mid-2011.The Composite Rating is a best possible 99.

129,TROW,"Investment performance can be a major factor in BlackRock's own fundamentals. So does its ability to attract new customers and retain current ones. Thus, it's not very surprising to see that BlackRock's revenue has swung from a 131% annual jump in 2007 to a 7% decline in 2009. In 2011 and 2012, BlackRock posted revenue gains of only 5% and 3%.

142,TROW,"Price was into growth stocks before such investing was cool.
"
143,TROW,"""He was the first to describe and use the terminology 'growth stock,'"" Jenks Cromwell, a portfolio manager at Maryland Capital after 26 years at T. Rowe Price, told IBD.
"
144,TROW,"Forbes deemed Price the Sage of Baltimore in 1975. The lesser-known investor was profiled in the book ""Lessons From the Legends of Wall Street"" by financial planner Nikki Ross, who deemed him a ""visionary growth investor.""
"
145,TROW,"The growth stock pioneer was also profiled in ""Money Masters of Our Time"" — a book by investment manager John Train: ""Investing was his life. Like most of the greatest investors or artists or professionals of any sort, Rowe Price lost himself in the task.""
"
146,TROW,"Price was far from an overnight sensation. Many of his early ventures had rough starts, but he had strong convictions and persevered.
"
147,TROW,"Price built his business and reputation through hard work, long hours, great foresight and passion. He didn't care what others thought of him or his investment strategy. He simply did his own research and drew his own conclusions.
"
148,TROW,"Taking Stock
"
149,TROW,"Price believed that like humans, companies go through life cycles and that big money comes from holding long term. Train noted in his book that Price held toolmaker Black & Decker for 35 years and drugmaker Merck (MRK) for 32 years.
"
150,TROW,"""He was very intellectually open and he was always looking at the environment,"" said former T. Rowe Price Chairman George Roche. ""He was very open to new ideas. He would say he always loved a good investment fight.""
"
151,TROW,"The potential for big money is what draws many to work in the investment world, but Price wasn't into the bling that comes with cash.
"
152,TROW,"""He didn't drive big, fancy cars,"" noted Cromwell. ""He didn't have chauffeurs. He was hardworking, but plain vanilla.""
"
153,TROW,"Roche said, ""He was an insomniac, so he would wake up in the middle of the night and he always kept a pencil and paper by his bedside so he could jot down the ideas that were rolling around in his head.""
"
154,TROW,"Price's background wasn't in business, finance or economics. He graduated from Swarthmore College near Philadelphia in 1919 with a degree in chemistry. He had short stints at a couple of chemical firms. One went out of business. Another laid him off.
"
155,TROW,"By then, his interests were diverging from chemistry. T. Rowe Price's history says he was spending his nights reading financial magazines instead of learning more about protons and neutrons.
"
156,TROW,"Out of work, he made a career change. He joined a small brokerage firm, then landed at Mackubin, Goodrich & Co. — the predecessor of today's Legg Mason (LM) — in 1925. He rose from stockbroker to head of the bond department.
"
157,TROW,"Price didn't enjoy the selling part of the investment business. His love was in finding the next gem.
"
158,TROW,"In 1934 he convinced Mackubin Goodrich to let him head an investment management department. That didn't last long. Three years later the firm shut that operation down when it failed to turn a profit.
"
159,TROW,"The market environment was of no help to Price. This was the thick of the Great Depression. Still, he figured he could do better than what he was accomplishing at Mackubin Goodrich — and set out to build his own firm. He was 39.
"
160,TROW,"Investors didn't exactly line up to hand Price their money. He struggled to pay his staff. Yet he hung on through the Depression, then found his footing.
"
161,TROW,"In 1950 he started his first mutual fund — the Growth Stock Fund — so clients could invest for their children. The fund took advantage of the recently passed Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, in which gains were taxed at the children's rate.
"
162,TROW,"Young Idea
"
163,TROW,"""The idea of starting a mutual fund wasn't to build a big empire of mutual funds,"" explained Cromwell. ""The mutual fund idea was to help provide a more practical way for the children of some of his clients to participate in some of the same investment wisdom and philosophy on a scale that didn't get complicated in the fees and so on.""
"
164,TROW,"Price's Growth Stock Fund didn't have a sales charge, and investors were free to invest as little or as much as they wanted.
"
165,TROW,"The Growth Stock Fund was a huge winner. A $10,000 investment in 1950 would have swelled to $48,036 by 1960, assuming reinvestment of capital gains and dividends. Wiesenberger, an investment rating firm that's now a part of Thomson Reuters, rated it No. 1 by 10-year performance in 1960.
"
166,TROW,"Price started another fund in 1960, and the beginning was tepid. His New Horizon Fund focused on young companies. In 1961, the fund rose 17%, which paled vs. the S&P 500's 27% gain. It got worse the next year, with the fund flopping 29% vs. a 9% loss in the S&P.
"
167,TROW,"""When he founded the New Horizon Fund, which concentrated on smaller companies — the acorn companies, so to speak — for a while it was like a bond; it didn't do anything. Everybody was kidding saying it was the New Horizontal fund,"" recalled Cromwell.
"
168,TROW,"The New Horizon Fund finally got going in 1965. It surged 44% vs. the S&P 500's 12%. Wanting a piece of the action, investors flooded him with money. Price could have made a lot for himself in fees, but turned down new investments. A barrage of new money can compromise performance by forcing portfolio managers to put the money to work somewhere.
"
169,TROW,"""He closed the fund down to all shareholders,"" said Cromwell.
"
170,TROW,"Details
"
171,TROW,"Price's methodology from the start of his firm in 1937 dealt with more than finding companies with fast-growing earnings. As Roche explained, Price looked for firms:
"
172,TROW,"• With an absence of cutthroat competition from other outfits.
"
173,TROW,"• Free of excessive labor costs.
"
174,TROW,"• Well managed.
"
175,TROW,"What fit that mold? A niche that Price knew well from his college days: drugmakers.

176,TROW,"""The industry that Mr. Price liked the most was the pharmaceuticals,"" said Roche. ""Now you're talking about the 1930s and '40s, where the pharmaceutical industry was an industry which sustained a high return on equity and strong growth for about 40 years.""
"
177,TROW,"He added that drugs ""had R&D (research and development) and innovation. You had patent protection. You had an absence of union interference. You had an industry which had above-average growth. Back in the old days you had good management. All that added up to a really powerful growth industry.""
"
178,TROW,"From 1938 to 1949, two of Price's biggest winners among pharmaceuticals were Sharp & Dohme, which surged 468% from 1938 to 1949, and Abbott Laboratories (ABT), which gained more than 300%.
"
179,TROW,"""He would avoid industries that had the opposite of that, like the old steel industries that everybody liked in the old day,"" said Roche. ""When he was in business initially in the old days, they were all still burned from the Depression, because he started in 1937. They (other investors) wanted stocks that had high yield then. They didn't worry about growth. And he said the exact opposite.""
"
180,TROW,"Price also checked technicals.

247,TROW,"Investors interested in stocks from the Financial - Investment Management sector have probably already heard of T. Rowe Price (TROW  -  Free Report) and HARGREAVES LNSD (HRGLY  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.T. Rowe Price has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while HARGREAVES LNSD has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that TROW has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.TROW currently has a forward P/E ratio of 16.37, while HRGLY has a forward P/E of 34.96. We also note that TROW has a PEG ratio of 1.47. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. HRGLY currently has a PEG ratio of 2.55.Another notable valuation metric for TROW is its P/B ratio of 4.84. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, HRGLY has a P/B of 28.88.These metrics, and several others, help TROW earn a Value grade of B, while HRGLY has been given a Value grade of F.TROW has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than HRGLY, so it seems like value investors will conclude that TROW is the superior option right now.

250,TROW,"Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) will be reviewing equity capital market transactions at its Australian branch after being accused of misleading potential investors in a block trade transaction that the unit had undertaken in relation to shares of Healthscope Limited in November 2015.The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (“ASIC”) has put forth concerns over ""certain representations"" that Goldman Sachs Australia made to investors about minimum fixed demand.Goldman Sachs Australia (GS Australia) has been asked to pay $500,000 into a community fund and sign an enforceable undertaking that will require it to tighten controls of its bookbuild messaging of certain transactions.Bookbuild is a process of generating, recording and capturing demand from potential investors for a capital raising transaction.“Certain Representations”GS Australia was appointed as a lead manager and underwriter of a block trade worth A$853 million. Its representatives were noted to have made comments such as “GS Australia had five cornerstone investors and/or that A$500 million of sale shares were covered.” ASIC believes that this led to a misperception of the minimum fixed demand for the sale shares.Also, though the level of demand that was expected to materialize did not occur, the representatives continued to pass above mentioned statements without taking adequate steps to avoid potential misperception.PromisesGS Australia has been able to dodge legal actions by promising to conduct an internal review of policies, procedures, training and supervision of employees engaged in equity capital market transactions led by GS Australia, which involve a bookbuild or underwriting process. The company will also implement changes to address any deficiencies identified.The bank has already undergone initial changes to its controls and processes. Per ASIC, these changes include requiring legal or compliance approval of all bookbuild messages being provided to potential investors in equity capital market transactions and having compliance staff attend sales calls at the launch of deals to have an oversight of messaging to investors.Our TakeGoldman Sachs’ well-diversified business, along with its solid investment banking operations, bolster its financial position. Further, the company’s focus on new growth opportunities through several strategic investments, including the digital consumer lending platform, will likely support its overall business growth.However, Goldman’s involvement in a number of investigations and lawsuits from investors and regulators have resulted in the stock losing 11.6% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 3.7%.Currently, Goldman Sachs carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

251,TROW,"A lawsuit has been filed against Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) alleging it to have encouraged retailers to include hidden fees in the selling price, using the bank’s financing programs. The news was reported by Reuters.The case has been filed by El Paso, TX-based J Edwards Jewelry Distributing and its president, John Silverman, on behalf of more than 5,000 retailers in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.Per the complaint, Wells Fargo made the retailers advertise that customers could purchase their products with the benefit of interest-free finance programs, when in fact, the prices were already inflated with a double-digit interest charge.Wells Fargo has been accused of violating the U.S. Truth in Lending Act, under which, lenders are supposed to disclose in details the financing charges.Wells Fargo’s finance programs — Wells Fargo Jewelry Advantage and Wells Fargo Home Projects — were advertised at the stores and websites of retailers. However, the bank had full control of what these advertisements would contain.Moreover, the lawsuit claims that Wells Fargo pockets nearly $800 million yearly through these hidden charges, whereas, the retailers had to pay higher sales taxes to local governments compared to what they would have paid in absence of these programs.In the first half of 2018, Wells Fargo remained busy with settling past legal hassles while problems in new areas of operations came in focus. It also underwent restructuring of unprofitable divisions along with facing limitations on asset growth by regulators.However, the Wall Street biggie proved its potential by clearing both tough levels of Feds stress test.

252,TROW,"Uncertainty gripped the equity markets on the news that the Trump administration is mulling to impose tariffs on imported cars, citing an obscure ruling to protect domestic auto manufacturers. The purported move is likely to backfire and adversely impact the operations of several auto manufacturing firms, leading to job loss and decline in production. With the on-again off-again trade war between the United States and China still remaining a potential threat, the domestic trade concerns appear far from over and are likely to continue weighing on the equity markets.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that garner higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless these are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.Why ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE more than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 20 stocks that qualified the screen:General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report): Founded in 1908, Detroit, MI-based General Motors is a leading global automotive firm. The company is engaged in designing, building and selling cars, trucks, crossovers and automobile parts worldwide.

It has amassed assets over $863.09 M, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap BlendLarge cap companies typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion.

Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.64%, making it one of the more expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.11%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsETFs offer a diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector--about 25% of the portfolio. Information Technology and Financials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Expeditors International Of Washington, Inc. (EXPD  -  Free Report) accounts for about 2.31% of total assets, followed by Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (TROW  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 22.03% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskFTCS seeks to match the performance of the The Capital Strength Index before fees and expenses. The Capital Strength Index is an equal-dollar weighted index which provides exposure to well-capitalized companies with strong market positions based on strong balance sheets, high degree of liquidity, ability to generate earnings growth & record financial strength & profit growth.The ETF has gained about 4.07% so far this year and was up about 16.03% in the last one year (as of 06/14/2018). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $45.42 and $54.95.The ETF has a beta of 0.94 and standard deviation of 12.26% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space.

Notably, negative foreign exchange impact of $1.5 billion remained an unfavorable factor.Legg Mason’s equity AUM at the end of May inched up 1.7% from the prior-month figure to $207 billion.

257,TROW,"In this era of digitization, T. Rowe Price Group (TROW  -  Free Report) plans to shut down its Operations Center in Tampa, FL, instead of renewing the lease. The center will be merged with the other two sites that provide service to individual investors and retirement plan participants. Notably, the company-owned properties are situated in Owings Mills, MD, and Colorado Springs, CO.The decision to shut down the center was taken after witnessing success in the firm’s digitalization efforts and as a response to its customers’ preference to involve digitally.The center, which is expected to close in June 2019, presently has 400 employees.

258,TROW,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (TROW  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 9.5 % in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is TROW due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.T.

Adjusted earnings per share of $1.52 outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.45. Further, the bottom line improved 25.6% from the year-ago figure of $1.21.Fourth-quarter results reflect higher revenues and AUM. Also, the company’s strong balance sheet position along with ample liquidity was the tailwinds.

QuoteAdditionally, activities of the company in the fiscal first quarter encouraged analysts to revise estimates upward. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 75 cents inched up nearly 1.4% over the last 30 days. However, the figure reflects year-over-year decline of 2.6%.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Franklin is likely to beat on earnings in the fiscal first quarter. This is because the company has the combination of two key ingredients for a possible earnings beat — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Franklin is currently pegged at +0.98%.Zacks Rank: The combination of Franklin’s Zacks Rank #2 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.  Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsStrong Market Performance to Benefit Franklin: Performance of equity markets remained strong during the October-December quarter. The S&P 500 Index gained nearly 6.64% in the quarter. Moreover, the index measuring international equity performance — the MSCI EAFE — climbed around 4.23%. This is anticipated to benefit this California-based asset manager.Higher AUM: Given Franklin’s AUM disclosure for December 2017 and equity market rally, the results are predicted to display higher AUM on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, the company is expected to record inflows mainly tied with Global Equity and U.S. Equity. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, total AUM for the to-be-reported quarter is expected to rise 5.1% to $757 million on a year-over-year basis.Increase in Revenues: Investment management fees, which mark a significant portion of the company’s revenues, might improve on the back of market strength.

262,TROW,"Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY  -  Free Report) is slated to announce fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results on Jan 30, before market open. Its revenues and earnings for the quarter are projected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

Thus, lease revenues are projected to decline during the quarter owing to a smaller lease portfolio as well as lower used vehicle value. Since the company primarily deals in auto loans, this might have a marginal adverse effect on its earnings in the quarter.Nonetheless, total other revenues are projected to increase sequentially. While the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $248 million for insurance premiums and service revenues earned reflects decline of 1.6% sequentially, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net other gain on investments for the quarter is $40 million, which depicts growth of nearly 74%.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total other revenues is $395 million, reflecting growth of 3.7% on a sequential basis.Further, given the higher interest rates and Ally Financial’s efforts to diversify into mortgage business, NII is expected to increase in the quarter.Ally Financial has been making efforts to grow inorganically, introduce new products and diversify operations. Given these initiatives, the company is likely to witness an increase in operating expenses.

Rowe Price came out with adjusted earnings per share of $1.45, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.44.

Rowe Price depicted bullish stance prior to the earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has been revised 2.1% upward over the last seven days.However, T. Rowe Price has a disappointing earnings surprise history. Before posting earnings beat in Q3, the company delivered positive surprises in only one quarter out of the prior four quarters. Overall, the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 1.18% in the trailing four quarters.T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise T. Rowe Price Group, Inc.

280,TROW,"T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (TROW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results, before the opening bell on Apr 25, with its revenues and earnings projected to improve year over year. Moreover, growth in assets under management (AUM) is expected.Last quarter, T. Rowe Price outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate, driven by rise in revenues. Also, AUM growth remained strong.Further, T. Rowe Price recorded positive earnings surprise in three out of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 6.28%. T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. QuoteHowever, activities of the company in the first quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.75 remained unchanged over the last seven days. Also, the figure indicates year-over-year rise of 48.31%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.3 billion for the quarter also reflects a jump of 16.36% from the year-ago quarter.Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Earnings WhispersAccording to our proven model, we cannot conclusively predict if T. Rowe Price will likely beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time. That’s because it doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of -2.18%.Zacks Rank: T. Rowe Price currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsExpenses to Escalate: The company did not point out anything related to its cost-control initiatives during the quarter. It incurs significant expenditures to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from existing clients. Though T. Rowe Price projects operating expenses to be down in 2018, it is likely that events not currently planned or expected might impact the expense level. Notably, the company anticipates capital expenditures in 2018 to be approximately $180 million, including two-third for technology development.Mutual Fund Products Performance: According to the Morningstar data, T. Rowe Price witnessed around $9.9 billion of net inflows on a combined basis being outflows in U.S. mutual fund products offset by net inflows excluding transfers to other portfolios in the to-be-reported quarter.Though the performance of equity markets disappointed in the first quarter, with the S&P 500 index declining 1.2% sequentially, the company is likely to record a rise in AUM on overall inflows. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for assets under management is $1.02 trillion, up 4.1% sequentially.Insignificant Fee Waivers: Management believes with the gradually improving interest-rate environment, fee waivers in its money market mutual funds and trusts will be insignificant.Revenue Growth: T. Rowe Price’s efforts to improve its operating efficiency have resulted in year-over-year top-line growth over the past few years. We believe the company is well poised to sustain this upbeat uptrend, in the near term. This comes on the back of several planned initiatives largely tied with launching investment strategies and vehicles, enhancing client-engagement capabilities in each distribution channel, strengthening distribution channel in the United States, EMEA, and the Asia Pacific, and improving its technology platform and deriving long-term cost efficiencies.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Earnings ESP for SVB Financial Group (SIVB  -  Free Report) is +1.38% and the stock carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

281,TROW,"The performance of the investment management/brokerage industry (part of the broader Finance sector) has been impressive over the past several quarters. Rising interest rates also continue to benefit the industry. Further, majority of the investment managers have stopped waiving off their fees as interest rates gradually improve. This is likely to aid top-line growth.Performance of equity markets remained strong in the July-September quarter. The S&P 500 Index gained 4.5% in the quarter and the index measuring international equity performance — the MSCI EAFE — climbed roughly 5%. This resulted in asset inflows and a rise in assets under management (AUM). Thus, the related fees might also witness an increase, thereby supporting revenue growth.Per the latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for the investment management/brokerage industry in the quarter are expected to grow 8% year over year.

282,TROW,"Northern Trust Corporation’s (NTRS  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter results, scheduled for Jan 24, are expected to reflect a year-over-year rise in earnings and revenues.Notably, the company provides majority of its asset management services through the C&IS unit, which generates more than 50% of total revenues. A rise in revenues in this segment will boost overall revenues for the company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.41 billion for sales for the to-be-reported quarter reflects a year-over-year improvement of 13.3%.Moreover, Northern Trust uses a lag effect to calculate its corporate custody and investment management fees, i.e. the computations are based on the prior quarter-end valuations. Since the performance of equity markets were relatively decent in the fourth quarter, the company will likely be able to register growth in custody, servicing and management fees.Here are the other factors that might influence the company’s Q4 performance:Modest Rise in Net Interest Income (NII): Overall loan growth remained decent in the quarter. Given the improvement in loan balances, along with the effect of rising interest rates, Northern Trust should record an increase in NII.Foreign Exchange Trading Revenues to Remain Stable: Given the mixed trend in foreign exchange (“FX”) trading volatility and volumes in the fourth quarter, the company’s revenues from FX trading might remain flat for the quarter.Marginal Increase in Expenses: Despite some cost-saving initiatives, Northern Trust’s continued investments in new business activities may lead to a marginal rise in expenses. Further, management expects transaction and integration costs relating to the acquisition of UBS Asset Management’s fund administration units in Luxembourg and Switzerland to be $8-$10 million in the fourth quarter.Adverse Impact of New Tax Code: The tax reform might result in elevated operating expenses from one-time bonus payments, higher charitable contributions and investment losses from securities portfolio restructurings. Also, though the company has not provided any information about the write-down of deferred tax assets (DTAs), it might record a significant one-time charge in the quarter.Let’s have a look at what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model indicates that chances of Northern Trust beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate are high as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Northern Trust is +0.09%.Zacks Rank: The combination of Northern Trust’s Zacks Rank #2 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.However, activities of the company during the quarter under review were unable to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.30 remained unchanged over the last seven days.

This is likely to benefit the New York-based e-broker’s revenues.Expenses Might Escalate: The company’s expenses are expected to climb due to its higher marketing activities and costs related to the Options House acquisition.Revenues Likely to Improve: Continued momentum in investment banking business and easing margin pressure are likely to support E*TRADE’s top line.

284,TROW,"Raymond James Financial, Inc. (RJF  -  Free Report) is scheduled to announce first-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Dec 31) results tomorrow, after the market closes. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Improved investment banking drove the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter 2017 earnings, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This was partially offset by elevated expenses and slowdown in trading activities.Also, the stock has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 8.1%.Raymond James Financial, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Raymond James Financial, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Raymond James Financial, Inc. QuoteNotably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be reported quarter earnings of $1.43 has remained stable over the last 30 days. The earnings estimates reflect a year-over-year jump of 33.6%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.7 billion indicates 14% growth from the prior-year quarter.Factors to Impact Q1 ResultsRise in underwriting fees: Driven by improving market conditions and chances of continued rise in interest rates in the future, the quarter witnessed an increase in debt issuance. Further, despite being the seasonally weak quarter for equity issuances globally, the quarter is likely to be an exception. Strong rally in the equity markets worldwide might have propelled IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, both debt and equity underwriting fees for Raymond James are likely to improve in the to-be-reported quarter.Muted advisory fee growth: Weaker M&A activity in terms of deals closed globally, despite a large number of new M&As announced in the quarter, will have a slight adverse effect. So, Raymond James is expected to record a slight rise in advisory fees.Trading income to fall due to lack of volatility: The quarter continued to witness low volatility in both bond and equity markets and thus trading activities remained sluggish. Also, the fall in trading revenues will primarily be due to comparison with the prior-year quarter that witnessed higher volatility following the U.S. Presidential election results. Therefore, Raymond James will likely report dismal trading revenues.Loan growth in RJ Bank to support interest income: With stabilizing economy and a rise in demand for loans and improvement in rates, RJ Bank segment is expected to record a jump in interest income.Expenses to rise: Raymond James is expected to incur integration costs during the quarter as it continues to grow inorganically. Also, as the company persistently hires advisors and invests in franchises, overall expenses are expected to increase.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Raymond James is likely to beat earnings this time. That’s because it does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Raymond James is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Raymond James has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP.

285,TROW,"Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (AMP  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results on Jan 24, after market close. While its earnings for the quarter are expected to grow year over year, revenues are expected to witness a decline.Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were primarily driven by a decline in expenses. Also, assets under management (AUM) witnessed growth. However, a slight decline in revenues acted as a headwind.That said, the company has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 12.5%.However, activities of the company during the fourth quarter failed to encourage analysts to revise earnings estimates upward. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $3.10 for the to-be-reported quarter decreased 1.3% over the last seven days. Nonetheless, the figure represents growth of 13.6% on a year-over-year basis.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $3.03 billion for the quarter, which is expected to witness a decline of 1.2% year over year.Notably, the company’s price performance has been quite encouraging. Ameriprise’s shares have gained 52.8% in 2017, outperforming the industry’s rally of 31.2%.AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. Price and EPS Surprise  AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. Price and EPS Surprise | AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. QuoteWill the rally in stock price continue post Q4 earnings release? To a great extent this depends on the company’s ability to maintain its trend of beating earnings estimates. Let’s take a look at what our quantitative model predicts.According to our quantitative model, chances of Ameriprise beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Ameriprise has an Earnings ESP of -1.88%.Zacks Rank: Ameriprise currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsAmeriprise has been consistently making efforts to improve its business. This is expected to have a positive impact on its profitability during the quarter.Further, we expect Advice & Wealth Management segment’s (AWM) performance to continue driving the company’s results in the quarter. The segment witnessed growth in assets in the previous quarter. Based on expectations of improved advisor productivity, the same is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, the company expects margin expansion in the AWM segment to continue, assuming that no significant market disruptions will take place.However, the Asset Management segment has been witnessing elevated levels of outflows for the last few quarters. In fact, as the company continues to make changes to enhance financial performance, outflows are expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter. This might affect the segment’s performance. Nonetheless, as the company enters more normalized markets, margins in this segment are anticipated to improve to the range of 35-39%.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Legg Mason, Inc.

287,TROW,"Lazard Ltd. (LAZ  -  Free Report) reported a positive surprise of 22.5% in second-quarter 2017. The company reported adjusted earnings of 98 cents per share, comfortably surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents. Further, the reported figure compared favorably with 61 cents earned in the prior-year quarter.Strong top-line performance and growth in assets under management (AUM) were positives. However, escalating expenses were a major drag.Shares of Lazard lost 3.76% following second-quarter 2017 earnings release. Despite earnings beat, perhaps, lesser support on the expense front led to investors’ bearish stance.Adjusted net income in the quarter came in at $130 million, up 62% year over year. On a GAAP basis, Lazard’s net income came in at $120 million or 91 cents per share compared with $80 million or 61 cents recorded in the prior-year quarter.Revenue Escalates, Costs Pressure PersistIn the second quarter, adjusted operating revenues came in at $720 million, up 33% year over year. The upsurge can chiefly be attributed to an increase in financial advisory revenues, as well as asset management revenues. Moreover, revenues outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $613 million.Adjusted operating expenses were around $523 million in the quarter, up 24.9% year over year. Higher compensation and benefits and non-compensation expenses led to the upsurge.Adjusted compensation and benefits expense flared up 33% on a year-over-year basis to $406.9 million. Adjusted non-compensation expense for the quarter was $116.1 million, up 4% year over year.The ratio of compensation expense to operating revenue was 56.5%, in line with the prior-year quarter. The ratio of non-compensation expense to operating revenue was 16.1% compared with 20.7% in the prior-year quarter.The company affirmed its annual targets of an adjusted non-compensation expense-to-revenue ratio between 16% and 20%, while the compensation-to-operating revenue ratio target is in the mid-to high 50 percentage range.Segment PerformanceFinancial Advisory: The segment’s total revenue was $411 million, up 43% from the prior-year quarter. The rise was primarily due to an increase in revenues from M&A and strategic advisory, as well as higher restructuring revenues.Asset Management: The segment’s total revenue was $307 million, up 22% from the prior-year quarter. Higher management, incentive and other fees led to the rise.Corporate: The segment generated total revenue of $2.5 million, which plunged 46% from the prior-year quarter.Strong Assets Under Management (AUM)As of Jun 30, 2017, AUM was recorded at $226 billion, up 18% year over year. The quarter experienced market and foreign exchange appreciation of $10.9 billion, partially offset by net outflows of $365 million.Average AUM came in at $222 billion, rising 15% year over year.Stable Balance SheetLazard’s cash and cash equivalents stood at $956 million as of Jun 30, 2017, compared with $1.16 billion as of Dec 31, 2016. The company’s stockholders’ equity was $1.30 billion compared with $1.29 billion as of Dec 31, 2016.Steady Capital Deployment ActivityDuring second-quarter 2017, Lazard returned $133 million to its shareholders. This included dividend payment of $50 million, share repurchase of $79 million and $4 million paid for meeting employee tax obligations in exchange of share issuances upon vesting of equity grants.Our ViewpointResults reflect a decent quarter for Lazard. Though the company’s diverse footprint, steady capital deployment activities and revenue strength position it favorably for the long run; macro headwinds, elevated costs pressure and stringent regulations put the company’s financials under strain. Lazard Ltd.

290,TROW,"People's United Financial, Inc. (PBCT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 19. While revenues and earnings are anticipated to grow year over year, we can’t conclusively predict a likely earnings beat.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might not be in store and what could influence the results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the last quarter.   Driven by higher revenues and lower provisions, People's United reported a positive earnings surprise of 4.4% in second-quarter 2017. Further, elevated loans and deposits balances were tailwinds. However, escalating expenses and decline in profitability ratios were the undermining factors.Notably, People's United delivered positive earnings surprises in two of the four trailing quarters, with an average beat of 3.26%.People's United Financial, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise People's United Financial, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | People's United Financial, Inc. QuoteRegarding the stock’s performance, shares of the company gained around 2.7% for the three-month period ended Sep 30, 2017, underperforming growth of 4.7% recorded by the industry.Will the upcoming earnings release give a boost to People's United’s stock? This depends largely on whether the firm is able to post a beat in the third quarter. However, our quantitative model doesn’t conclusively point toward a likely earnings beat this time. Here’s why:People's United doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) — for increasing its chances of an earnings beat. It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for People's United is -0.28%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: People's United’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsLoan Growth: Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans grew on a sequential basis during the third quarter. Particularly, growth in commercial and consumer loans, with slowdown in commercial real estate loans is expected. Therefore, interest income for banks is projected to improve marginally.In addition, management’s expectations of loan and deposit growth in 2017 will likely be reflected in this quarter. Management projects loan portfolio to grow in the range of 11-13%.Modest Rise in Net Interest Income (NII): Given the influence of rise in interest rates, People's United should have recorded an increase in NII. Notably, management’s projections of 2017 NII to grow in the range of 12-14% is likely to show impact in the third quarter as well.Fee Income to Escalate: On strong retail banking, fee income might escalate for the bank. In addition, the company projects non-interest income to rise in the range of 5-7% in 2017, the impact of which is likely to be reflected in the to-be-reported quarter.Increase in Expenses: Despite undertaking a number of expense-saving initiatives, People’s United’s operating expenses have witnessed an elevated level. Though the company is focused on optimizing its branch network and has initiated installation of technology to improve efficiencies and reduce costs, escalating expense levels are likely to limit bottom-line expansion.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.27% and carries a Zacks Rank of 2.

298,TROW,"Legg Mason Inc. (LM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Dec 31) results on Jan 24, after the market closes. This asset management company is expected to benefit from a significant rise in performance fees, while distribution and service fees, and other service revenues may show deterioration.Given the expected increase in assets under management during the quarter (the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $764 billion indicates a 7.6% year-over-year increase), Legg Mason’s performance fees are projected to improve significantly. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for performance fees of $37.50 million reflects 63.8% growth from the prior-year quarter. Further, management expects non-pass-through performance fees in the range of $25-$35 million and pass-through performance fees of about $10 million in the to-be-reported quarter.However, distribution and service fees are anticipated to decline 10% year over year to $81 million. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for other service revenues of $0.84 million indicates a 32.8% plunge from the prior-year quarter.Overall, Legg Mason is expected to record a rise in revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $764.42 million implies a 6.9% year-over-year increase.On the cost front, management expects compensation ratio to be down in the range of 52-53%, reflecting seasonal decline. Further, we expect overall operating expenses to trend downward as the company has its cost control mechanisms in place.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the to-be-reported quarter has been revised nearly 5% upward over the last 30 days to 84 cents. The consensus estimate reflects a year-over-year improvement of 68%.Legg Mason’s fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 34.7% in the past 12 months, outperforming the 13.8% growth recorded by the industry.

299,TROW,"Capital One Financial Corporation (COF  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results on Jan 23, after market close. The company is expected to witness a rise in total net interest income (NII) on a year-over-year basis.Driven by improving economy, purchase volume growth and seasonality, credit card loans (part of broader consumer loan portfolio) continued to increase during the fourth quarter. This, along with higher interest rates, is likely to support Capital One’s credit card NII.Moreover, the acquisition of Cabela's Incorporated’s credit card operations, completed in September 2017, is expected to further aid credit card NII growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for domestic credit card NII for the quarter is $3.38 billion, which shows 9.4% year-over-year rise. Also, international credit card NII is projected to be $304 million, increasing 15.6% year over year.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for commercial banking NII of $594 million shows 5.1% growth on a year-over-year basis. Also, NII for consumer banking division is expected to be $1.52 billion, up 1.4% from the prior-year quarter.Thus, we believe Capital One will report an increase in total NII for to-be-reported quarter.Other Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsModest fee income growth: Capital One is expected to witness a rise in its fee income in the to-be-reported quarter. As the quarter is likely to show increased card usage, interchange fees (major part of its fee income) are expected to rise.Marginal increase in expenses: Similar to the prior quarter, operating expenses are expected to trend upward in the fourth quarter. Specifically, marketing expenses will likely remain elevated with rising loan growth opportunities.Asset quality to worsen: While improvement in card loans is leading to an increase in interest income, Capital One will continue to witness a rise in credit card delinquency rates. The company expects domestic credit card charge-off rate to be in the high 4-5% range in 2017.Now, let’s have a look at what our quantitative model predicts:According to our quantitative model, chances of Capital One beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, which is required to increase the odds of a positive earnings surprise.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Capital One is -0.04%.Zacks Rank: Capital One currently has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Activities of the company in the fourth quarter failed to encourage analysts to revise earnings estimates upward. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the quarter remained stable at $1.85 over the last seven days. However, the estimate reflects year-over-year improvement of 27.6%.Notably, considering the growth in the last two years, management remains confident about delivering EPS growth (excluding adjusting items) in the range of 7-11% for 2017.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales for the to-be-reported quarter is $7.12 billion, which indicates 8.5% growth from the prior-year quarter.Capital One Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Capital One Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Capital One Financial Corporation QuoteStocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Synovus Financial Corp.

300,TROW,"Driven by prudent expenses management, shares of Apollo Global Management, LLC (APO  -  Free Report) gained 5.1% following the first-quarter earnings release on May 3. However, the company reported economic net loss of 30 cents per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss of 4 cents. Also, the reported figure compared unfavorably with the economic net income of 82 cents per share in the year-ago period.Results were primarily affected by poor performance across all segments, each witnessing a decline in economic income. However, higher assets under management (AUM) supported the results. Further, lower expenses acted as a tailwind during the quarter.GAAP net loss attributable to Apollo Global was $62.6 million or 34 cents per Class A share against net income of $145.2 million or 75 cents per Class A share in the prior-year quarter.Decline in Revenues Offsets Rise in AUM and Lower ExpensesTotal revenues were $166.9 million, plunging 75% year over year. Also, it lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $242 million. The decline was primarily due to investment loss. Apollo Global’s total revenues for combined segments in the first quarter amounted to $149.6 million, down 78% from the prior-year quarter. The plunge was primarily due to significant revenue decline in the private equity segment.  Total expenses for combined segments decreased 38% year over year to $214.9 million in the reported quarter. The decline was primarily due to a fall in profit sharing expenses resulting from the decrease in carried interest income.Fee-earnings AUM increased 18% to $182.5 billion from $154.2 million in the year-ago quarter. As of Mar 31, 2018, total AUM was $247.4 billion, up 25% from $197.5 billion as of Mar 31, 2017. The rise in total AUM was due to an increase in private equity, credit and real estate segments.Capital and LiquidityAs of Mar 31, 2018, Apollo Global had $988 million of cash and cash equivalents and $1.4 billion of debt (excluding $500 million of undrawn revolving credit facility). These amounts exclude cash and debt pertaining to Apollo Global’s consolidated funds and consolidated variable interest entities.Distribution UpdateAlong with the earnings release, Apollo Global declared a quarterly cash distribution of 38 cents per Class A share.

Earnings per share of 60 cents lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 65 cents, but improved 22%, year over year, from 49 cents.Lower revenues and reduced equity assets affected the company’s results. However, lower expenses and improved assets under management (AUM) were positives.Net income for the quarter came in at $60.3 million compared with $49.6 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Downtrend in Revenues, Costs Down Total revenues in the first quarter declined 4% year over year to $263.9 million.

However, administrative service fees were up 5% year over year to $49 million.During the reported quarter, Federated derived 40% of its revenues from money market assets, and remaining 60% from equity and fixed-income assets.Furthermore, due to fall in net investment income and higher debt expenses, the company recorded non-operating expenses of $0.8 million in the quarter compared with $3.1 million in the year-ago quarter.Total operating expenses dipped 6% year over year to $184.2 million.

302,TROW,"TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (AMTD  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, after the market closes on Jan 22. Revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.This Omaha-based investment broker’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 (ending September) earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and came in above the prior-year quarter figure. Results were benefited from net interest margin expansion and growth in revenues. However, the positives were partially offset by elevated expenses.Activities of TD Ameritrade during the fiscal first quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. Thus, over the last seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings has remained stable at 51 cents. Nevertheless, it reflects a year-over-year improvement of 24.4%.However, TD Ameritrade’s shares have underperformed the industry in the past six months. The company recorded a gain of 18.4% against the industry’s rally of 24%.TD Ameritrade had delivered positive earnings surprises in two of the prior four quarters, with an average beat of 2.9%.TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model, chances of TD Ameritrade beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in this quarter are dim. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for TD Ameritrade is -1.53%.Zacks Rank: TD Ameritrade carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Fiscal Q1 ResultsExpenses likely to increase: Expenses are likely to remain under pressure, given the company’s ongoing investments in technology.  Further, absence of steady cost control measures is likely to lead to operational inefficiency.Margin pressure might ease: With the gradually improving rate environment, margin pressure for TD Ameritrade finally seems to be easing. The company reported a rise in net interest margin (NIM) in fiscal 2017.Exposure to Market Volatility: The company is exposed to severe market volatility. Benefiting from the volatility in markets, the company’s trading volumes have been graphing an uptrend. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s average client trades per day of 667,000 reflects 26.1% sequential growth in Q1.Revenues to grow: TD Ameritrade’s interest revenues are likely to improve on the back of higher interest rates. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for interest revenues is projected to be $247 million, up 17.6% from the prior-quarter figure. Further, transaction based revenues are also expected to grow. The consensus estimate for these revenues is $418 million, up 26.6% sequentially.Continued asset growth: The company has been witnessing double-digit asset growth for the last several years. Notably, during fiscal 2017, the company witnessed an annualized growth rate of 10% in net new client assets, within the long-term target of increasing on an annual rate of 7-11%. With an innovative trading platform, consistent focus on high net-worth clients, and enhanced service model to boost engagement and retention, we anticipate TD Ameritrade to display the improving trend in fiscal first quarter as well.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Earnings ESP for Legg Mason (LM  -  Free Report) is +0.18% and the stock has a Zacks Rank #2.

303,TROW,"Navient Corporation (NAVI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth quarter and 2017 results on Jan 23, after the market closes. Both revenues and earnings are expected to decline on a year-over-year basis.In the third quarter, Navient surpassed Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings on higher fee income. However, lower net interest income and higher expenses were the headwinds.The company has a weak surprise history. It lagged earnings estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and delivered an average negative surprise of nearly 1%.Moreover, activities of the company during the fourth quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings decreased 2.3% over the last 30 days. Also, the figure represents a decline of nearly 2% on a year-over-year basis.Navient Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Navient Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Navient Corporation QuoteFactors to Influence Q4 ResultsHigher Legal Expenses: The company’s legal expenses will likely remain elevated due to the lawsuits filed against it during the quarter.Increased Expenses from Investment in Technology: Navient acquired a technologically advanced company in the to-be-reported quarter, in line with its aim to expand services outside the educational industry. This initiative will likely elevate expenses.Easing Margin Pressure: Navient’s prime-indexed assets lag the rise in short-term rates by a quarter. As a result, pressure on net interest margin (NIM) will likely ease. Moreover, with the acquisition of assets of Earnest, consisting of education refinancing, NIM is anticipated to be higher.Let’s have a look at what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model doesn’t conclusively show that Navient will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time around, as it does not have the right combination of two key components.

Also, assets under management (AUM) improved during the quarter. However, lower revenues were the undermining factor.For full-year 2017, adjusted net income was $220.9 million or $2.18 per share, up from $208.9 million or $2.03 per share in the prior year.Downtrend in Revenues, Costs Down For 2017, total revenues came in at $1.1 billion, down 4% year over year.Total revenues in the fourth quarter declined 4% year over year to $278.3 million. Moreover, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $284 million.The year-over-year decline in revenues was mainly due to the change in a customer relationship and altered average money market assets mix. This was partially mitigated by decreased voluntary fee waivers related to certain money market funds and increased revenues resulting from higher average equity and fixed-income assets.Also, net investment advisory fees dropped 5% year over year to $186.1 million.

306,TROW,"Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 12, before the opening bell. Its earnings and revenues are likely to improve year over year.Citigroup delivered a positive earnings surprise of nearly 5% last quarter, driven by higher revenues. The company recorded solid banking revenues. However, expenses and costs of credit surged.This earnings beat translated into improved price movement for the company. Over the last three months, shares of Citigroup gained 12.8% compared with 3.9% growth recorded by the industry.Will the rally in stock price continue post third-quarter earnings release? It mostly depends on whether the firm is able to maintain its trend of beating earnings for the last four quarters. Citigroup Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Citigroup Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Citigroup Inc. QuoteHowever, our quantitative model doesn’t call for an earnings beat this time around. A stock needs to have the right combination of the two key criteria – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or at least 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Unfortunately, this is not the case here, as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Citigroup is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at $1.30. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Citigroup’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsTrading Revenues to Descend: Trading business is expected to be down in the third quarter as indicated by Citigroup’s chief financial officer, John Gerspach, with his projection of about a 15% year-over-year decline in trading revenues. The bank projects weak trading revenues to continue on subdued volatility in markets.Consumer Banking Revenues to Exhibit Growth: In consumer, in North America, revenue growth in the third quarter is expected in retail banking, excluding mortgage as well as modest organic growth in cards as full rate balances rise. In International consumer, continuous revenue growth is anticipated.Expense to Trend Lower: Citigroup continues to execute on its investment plans in Mexico, modernizing branches and ATMs, enhancing digital capabilities, and upgrading core operating platforms. These infrastructure investments will likely improve operating efficiency and returns over time. Therefore, management anticipates maintaining positive operating leverage each year throughout the investment period, including current year.Rise in Net Interest Income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly, in the areas of commercial and industrial as well as consumer — might perk up interest income.Investment Banking Fees Might Escalate: Global investment banking fees have been on an upswing, with more than half the contribution from North America. The U.S. banks topped the league tables. Improving U.S. economy data, along with gaining market share, helped record higher investment banking fees. Moreover, as the interest rate hike is expected to continue, many U.S. companies have been raising fresh debt capital over recent quarters to avoid higher interest rates later. As debt origination fees account for about half of total investment banking fees, this has been leading to strong gains. Thus, Citigroup is also likely to report an impressive quarter.In Institutional business, consistent year-over-year revenue growth is projected in accrual businesses, including PPS, security services, and the private bank. Market revenues are likely to reflect a normal modest seasonal decline sequentially and investment banking revenues are expected to be a level closer to the first quarter, perhaps a little lower, assuming a seasonal slowdown in the third-quarter underwriting activity.Credit Costs to Rise: Cost of credit is likely to be higher, quarter on quarter, driven by the normalization of credit cost in Corp/Other as well as continued volume growth in consumer. Management estimates the full-year NCL rate to be around 285 basis points (bps) in branded cards and 470 bps in Retail Services for 2017, with some quarterly variability.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Synovus Financial Corp.

308,TROW,"Ameriprise Financial, Inc.’s (AMP  -  Free Report) Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating has been affirmed at “a-” by A.M. Best. The company’s Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings have also been affirmed. The ratings outlook remains stable.Additionally, A.M. Best has affirmed RiverSource Life Insurance Company and its subsidiary’s Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating of “aa-” and its Financial Strength Rating of A+.Also, the Financial Strength Rating and Long-TermIssuer Credit Rating of IDS Property Casualty Insurance Company and its subsidiary have been affirmed at “A” and “a+”, respectively.RiverSource Life Insurance Company is based in Minneapolis and is the key life/health insurance subsidiary of Ameriprise, while IDS Property Casualty Insurance Company is the property/casualty insurance subsidiary of Ameriprise.Ameriprise remains well positioned for growth, given its discipline in financial planning and strengths in product development. The company has an effective and well-developed enterprise risk management program in place, which helps in hedging risks. Additionally, Ameriprise offers various variable annuity as well as fixed annuity products to retail clients through its Annuities segment. These variable annuity products offer relatively modest guarantees, which help in reducing variable annuity guarantee risks for the company. Notably, Ameriprise is on track to effectively cover its interest payments and maintains moderate financial leverage.However, Ameriprise’s operations are highly correlated with the performance of the equity markets and client activities. Over the last few quarters, equity markets have remained volatile. Also, client activity is low. Thus, A.M.

The company reported adjusted earnings of $1.26 per share, comfortably surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06. Further, the reported figure came in higher than the prior-year quarter figure of 83 cents.Top-line strength and growth in assets under management (AUM) were positives. However, escalating expenses was an undermining factor.Adjusted net income in the quarter came in at $166 million, up 51% year over year. On a GAAP basis, Lazard’s net income came in at $160 million or $1.21 per share compared with $108 million or 81 cents recorded in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Escalate, Cost Pressure PersistsIn the first quarter, adjusted operating revenues came in at $724 million, up 16% year over year. The upsurge can chiefly be attributed to increase in financial advisory and asset-management revenues.Adjusted operating expenses were around $518.1 million in the quarter, up 12.6% year over year. Higher compensation and benefits, and non-compensation expenses led to the upswing.Adjusted compensation and benefits expense flared up 14%, on a year-over-year basis, to $404 million.

The ratio of non-compensation expense to operating revenues was 15.8% compared with 17.2% reported in the year-ago quarter.The company affirmed its annual targets of an adjusted non-compensation expense-to-revenue ratio between 16% and 20%, while the compensation-to-operating revenue ratio target is in the mid-to high 50 percentage range.Segment PerformanceFinancial Advisory: The segment’s total revenues came in at $389 million, up 16% from the year-earlier quarter. The uptick primarily stemmed from increase in revenues from M&A advisory, partially offset by lower restructuring revenues.Asset Management: The segment’s total revenues were $330 million, up 18% from the prior-year quarter. Higher management and other fees led to this rise.Corporate: The segment generated total revenues of $5.2 million, which plunged 49% from the prior-year quarter.Strong Assets Under Management (AUM)As of Mar 31, 2018, AUM was recorded at $251.7 billion, up 17% year over year.

This included dividend payment of $202 million, share repurchase of $146 million and $101 million paid for meeting employee-tax obligations in exchange of share issuances upon vesting of equity grants.Our ViewpointResults reflect an impressive quarter for Lazard. Though the company’s diverse footprint, steady capital-deployment activities and revenue strength position it favorably for the long run, macro headwinds, elevated costs pressure and stringent regulations put the company’s financials under strain. Lazard Ltd Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Lazard Ltd Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Lazard Ltd QuoteCurrently, Lazard carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The company reported adjusted net income of 66 cents per share, considerably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents.

However, escalating expenses remain a concern.Including one-time items, Legg Mason reported net income of $50.9 million or 52 cents per share compared with $33.5 million or 31 cents in the year-ago quarter.Revenue Rises, Expenses Flare UpLegg Mason’s total operating revenue in the quarter came in at $793.8 million, up 13.4% year over year. The upsurge was mainly due to elevated average long term AUM and performance fees, along with revenues associated with the addition of Clarion and EnTrust. In addition, revenues outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $779.2 million.Investment advisory fees increased 17.4% year over year to $713.7 million in the quarter.

However, distribution and service fees were down 13.7% year over year to $78.9 million.Operating expenses increased 10.0% to $686.6 million on a year-over-year basis. The rise was chiefly due to higher compensation and benefits (up 15.3%), and expenses related to impairment of intangible assets.Adjusted operating margin of Legg Mason was 22.5%, significantly up from 11.3% in the prior-year quarter. Lower acquisition and transition-related costs led to the rise.Solid Assets PositionAs of Jun 30, 2017, Legg Mason’s AUM was $741.2 billion, down slightly year over year from $741.9 billion. Of the total AUM, fixed income constituted 55%, equity 26%, liquidity 10% and alternatives represented 9%.AUM inched up 1.8% sequentially from $728.4 billion as of Mar 31, 2017, driven by positive market performance of $8.4 billion, long-term net inflows of $0.5 billion and $0.7 billion in positive foreign exchange. These positives were partially offset by liquidity outflows of $11.5 billion. Notably, change in category of $16.0 billion of separately managed account assets which were previously classified as Assets Under Advisement also positively impacted AUM.Notably, long-term net inflows of $0.5 billion included equity inflows of $1.0 billion and fixed income inflows of $0.3 billion, partially mitigated by alternative outflows of $0.8 billion. Additionally, average AUM was $740.3 billion compared with $709.1 billion in the prior-year quarter and $718.9 billion in the prior quarter.Strong Balance SheetAs of Jun 30, 2017, Legg Mason had $491 million in cash. Total debt was $2.2 billion, while shareholders’ equity came in at $4.0 billion.The ratio of total debt to total capital (total equity plus total debt excluding consolidated investment vehicles) was 36%, in line with the prior quarter.Capital Deployment UpdateLegg Mason repurchased 2.4 million shares at a total cost of $90 million in the reported quarter, while 0.3 million shares at a total cost of $12 million were repurchased under net share settlements of annual deferred compensation award vesting.Our ViewpointWe believe Legg Mason has the potential to outperform its peers over the long run, given its diversified product mix and leverage in the changing market demography. Further, with strategic acquisitions, restructuring initiatives and cost-cutting measures, we anticipate operating efficiencies to improve. Also, steady capital deployment activities continue to boost investors’ confidence in the stock. However, escalating expenses remain a key concern. Legg Mason, Inc.

312,TROW,"Investment management (part of the broader Finance sector) performed decently over the last several quarters. This time too, decent results are anticipated on positive markets, favorable currencies and better-than-expected flows.The S&P 500 Index recorded a total return of 3.1% in the second quarter. Though the U.S. equity market recorded positive returns amid mixed economic data, it underperformed both non-U.S. developed and emerging markets. Hence, asset managers with global presence are anticipated to record a rise in equity asset under management  (AUM). Moreover, weakness of the U.S. dollar drove the global diversified AUM mix. Further, rising interest rates are expected to lead to decline in fee waivers. Also, demand for alternative investment sources might have aided revenue growth for the investment managers. However, rise in operating expenses, driven by marketing and investments might hurt the bottom line.Conversely, during the quarter, fixed income generated positive returns as investors ran for safe haven assets. Consequently, fixed income prices increased and resulted in reduced yields.Notably, some investment managers, including The Blackstone Group L.P. (BX  -  Free Report), T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (TROW  -  Free Report), Ameriprise Financial Inc.’s (AMP  -  Free Report) and BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report), have already released results.

Given Franklin’s AUM disclosure for Jun 2017, the upcoming release will display higher assets under management on a year-over-year basis. Franklin’s cost-control efforts should support bottom-line growth to some extent.  Notably, management expects expenses in fiscal 2017 to remain flat or decline slightly, considering the impact of previous cost-cutting initiatives.In addition, we believe that the company’s top line will likely get support from its diversified portfolio offerings, as well as global presence (read more: Franklin to Post Q3 Earnings: A Surprise in the Cards?).Moreover, our proven quantitative model predicts a likely earnings beat.

Further, the bottom line compared favorably with the prior-year quarter figure of 74 cents per share.The results reflect Franklin’s top-line strength, supported by higher investment management fees. Nevertheless, elevated operating expenses remained a headwind. Also, net outflows and lower assets under management (AUM) were the undermining factors.The company reported net income of $443.2 million, up 5.3% from the prior-year quarter.Revenues Rise, Costs IncreaseTotal operating revenues increased 1% year over year to $1.62 billion in the quarter, mainly due to higher investment management, shareholder servicing fees and other fees, partly offset by lower sales and distribution fees. Also, revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.59 billion.Investment management fees climbed 3% year over year to $1.12 billion while sales and distribution fees declined 5% to $409.8 million. Shareholder servicing fees rose 9%, on a year-over-year basis to $61.3 million while other net revenues jumped 24% to $29.6 million.Total operating expenses flared up 2% to $1.06 billion.

323,TROW,"President Trump called for tariffs on U.S. steel and aluminum imports that could hurt corporations as well as consumers. Such tariffs also stirred fears of a trade dispute between the United States and China. This in turn propelled Wall Street’s fear gauge index above its historic average and dragged the broader markets down.Inflation scare leading to rate hikes had already triggered a sudden panic among investors. After all, rate hikes will raise borrowing costs, eventually denting corporate profits and affecting the U.S. economy. Amid such uncertainty, investing in dividend aristocrats seems prudent, as these provide higher total returns with lower volatility and are undoubtedly the holy grail of investing.Tariffs to Affect U.S. CorporationsWall Street began March on a sour note after Trump said that the United States will impose steel and aluminum tariffs. Trump said that the U.S. will impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum. Such a protectionist trade policy may be one of the widest-reaching trade action he has taken to date, but it has triggered a lot of concern among corporations and consumers.Tariffs will increase the cost of companies that rely heavily on aluminum and steel, like auto and plane makers. Needless to say, shares of Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report), General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) dipped around 3%. In fact, Corporate America has cautioned Trump that tariffs could backfire. After all, imports make up for about a third of the steel American business houses use every year.Higher prices on steel and aluminum, furthermore, will compel companies that rely on such products to pass on some of the costs to consumers. Increased consumer prices may in the long run hamper sales growth and affect the company, leading to job losses.Wall Street is Worried About a Trade WarTrump’s contentious tariff announcement has raised apprehensions about retaliation from China and other major U.S. trading partners. China cautioned America to abide by multilateral trade rules and not to harm the delicate global economy. We shouldn’t forget that China is the world’s dominant steel producer and Trump’s tariff moves could easily start a trade war between them.Li Xinchuang, vice secretary general of the China Iron and Steel Association, added that imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports is an “extremely stupid move.” This will make U.S. industries fall behind globally during a period when “China is in its prime.”Tariffs also raise threats of a trade war with America’s closest allies, Canada. And why not? Canada is the top exporter of both steel and aluminum to the United States. Canada is solely responsible for manufacturing 17% of all the U.S. steel imports and 43% of all aluminum imports. Canadian foreign minister Chrystia Freeland, in the meantime, has announced that “should restrictions be imposed on Canadian steel and aluminum products, Canada will take responsive measures to defend its trade interests and workers.”Rate Hike Fears LoomConcerns about trade came at a time when the broader market is already on a roller-coaster ride. The broader S&P 500 and the Dow tanked nearly 4% in February. Both the bourses had their worst month in two years. Meanwhile, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) soared 15% on Mar 1, indicating that turbulence has picked up as well.Investors remain worried that rise in inflation in the near term will prompt the Fed to hike short-term interest rates at a faster pace than expected. This in turn will increase borrowing costs for business and consumers, which will eventually lead to a slowdown in the economy. It’s important to also note that an easy monetary policy helped the equity market notch a nearly nine-year bull run.Inflation to RiseRecent hike in pay levels raised worries about higher commodity prices. Wage growth hit the fastest pace in January in more than eight-and-a-half years, according to the Labor Department. Average hourly wages increased 9 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.74. This helped the average year-on-year hourly earnings to rise to 2.9%, the highest since June 2009. Americans are now getting fatter paychecks mostly due to a tighter labor market, tax cut policy and a rise in the minimum wage threshold in several states.Consumers have also been ramping up their spending levels of late as they are largely benefiting from a rise in income. Traders predict that such upbeat consumer outlays will fuel inflation (read more: US Consumers Most Confident in 17 Years: Top 4 Picks).Minutes of the Jan 30-31 Federal Open Market Committee meeting has already shown that several officials expect inflation to move up this year and touch the Fed’s 2% target. Only a small number of them forecast inflation to fall short of 2%.Why Dividend Aristocrats? 5 Solid ChoicesGiven the aforesaid concerns, investing in dividend aristocrats seems judicious.

325,TROW,"The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results on Jan 18, before market open. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Higher revenues and assets under management (AUM) growth were offset by an increase in expenses.BNY Mellon has a decent earnings surprise history. It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice and matched once in the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 3.4%.However, activities of the company in the fourth quarter were not adequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 91 cents has remained stable over the last 30 days. Nevertheless, the figure reflects year-over-year growth of 18.2%.Further, the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $3.98 billion for the to-be-reported quarter, reflecting an improvement of 5.1% year over year.Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) QuoteBNY Mellon’s shares have gained 13.7% in 2017, underperforming the 18.9% growth of the industry it belongs to.Will the share price performance improve post Q4 earnings? To a great extent it depends on whether the company will be able to beat earnings estimates this time around. Let’s take a look at what our quantitative model predicts.A Likely Positive Surprise?According to our quantitative model, chances of BNY Mellon beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BNY Mellon is +0.16%.Zacks Rank: BNY Mellon carries a Zacks Rank of 3. This when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsModest Improvement in Fee Revenues: The equity markets have performed decently in the fourth quarter. As a result, performance fee is expected to improve. Moreover, seasonally higher securities lending revenues during the quarter are likely to boost fee income growth.However, management projects Depositary Receipts revenues to decline nearly $80 million sequentially due to seasonality. While, lower DR revenues and expectation of a fall in foreign exchange trading revenues due to lower volumes might be offsetting factors, overall fee income is expected to improve during the quarter.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fee revenues of $3.10 billion reflects 5.4% year-over-year improvement.Higher Rates to Boost Net Interest Revenues (NIR): The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest-earning assets of $290.3 billion reflects a marginal improvement from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, overall loan balances witnessed modest improvement in the quarter. Given the improvement in loan balances along with the effect of rising interest rates, BNY Mellon should register an increase in NIR.Moreover, management believes any rate hike will lead to an improvement in margin. Hence, improving margins due to the increase in rates is likely to more than offset the reduced size of balance sheet and hence lead to a modest increase in NIR in the quarter. Notably, management expects NIR to be at the higher end of the 4-6% range in 2017.Expenses to Decline Slightly: Management expects legal and professional expenses to decline by nearly $10 million in fourth-quarter 2017. Despite the impact of investment-related expenses, overall costs are expected to decline.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few other finance stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.BB&T Corp. (BBT  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter results on Jan 18. It has an Earnings ESP of +0.33% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Associated Banc-Corp.

326,TROW,"People's United Financial, Inc. (PBCT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 18. Both revenues and earnings are anticipated to grow year over year, with likely earnings beat on the cards.Before we discuss why an earnings beat is likely and what could influence the results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the last quarter.   Driven by higher revenues and lower provisions, People's United reported a positive earnings surprise of 4% in third-quarter 2017. Further, elevated loans and deposits balances were tailwinds. However, escalating expenses was the undermining factor.Notably, People's United delivered positive earnings surprises in two of the four trailing quarters, with an average beat of 2.09%. People's United Financial, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise People's United Financial, Inc. price-eps-surprise | People's United Financial, Inc. QuoteRegarding the stock’s performance, shares of the company have gained around 3.1% for the three-month period ended Dec 31, 2017, outperforming growth of 2.6% recorded by the industry.Will the upcoming earnings release give a boost to People's United’s stock? This depends largely on whether the firm is able to post a beat in the fourth quarter. Notably, our quantitative model predicts a likely earnings beat this time. Here’s why:Our proven model indicates that chances of People's United beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate is high as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at +0.61%. This is a very significant and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company.Zacks Rank: The combination of People's United’s Zacks Rank #2 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged over the last seven days and is expected to move up 12.5% year over year. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is projected at $392.7 million, up 18.6% year over year.Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsLoan Growth: Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans declined on a sequential basis during the December-end quarter. Particularly, growth in consumer loans, with slowdown in real estate loans, along with commercial and industrial (C&I) loans, is expected. Therefore, interest income for banks is projected to improve marginally.In addition, management’s expectations of loan and deposit growth in 2017 will likely be reflected in this quarter. Management projects loan portfolio to grow in the range of 11-13%.Modest Rise in Net Interest Income (NII): Given the influence of rise in interest rates, People's United is anticipated to have recorded an increase in NII. Notably, management’s projections of 2017 NII to grow in the range of 12-14% is likely to show impact in the quarter to be reported as well.Fee Income to Escalate: On strong retail banking, fee income might escalate for the bank. Additionally, the company projects non-interest income to rise in the range of 5-7% in 2017, the impact of which is likely to be reflected in the to-be-reported quarter.Increase in Expenses: Despite undertaking a number of expense-saving initiatives, People’s United’s operating expenses have witnessed an elevated level. Though the company is focused on optimizing its branch network and has initiated installation of technology to improve efficiencies and reduce costs, escalating expense levels are likely to limit bottom-line expansion.Adverse impact of new tax code: The tax reform might result in elevated operating expenses from one-time bonus payments, higher charitable contributions and investment losses from securities portfolio restructurings. Also, though the company has not provided any information about the write-down of deferred tax assets (DTAs), it might record a significant one-time charge in the fourth quarter.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Earnings ESP for Legg Mason, Inc. (LM  -  Free Report) is +0.18% and the stock flaunts a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy). The company is scheduled to release December quarter-end results on Jan 24.

While the company is expected to witness year-over-year growth in revenues, earnings might decline.However, the company has a decent earnings surprise history. It topped earnings in two of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 5.3%.In the last quarter, the company’s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were supported by higher net interest income and lower provisions. However, lower non-interest income was an undermining factor.Fifth Third’s shares gained 8.4% in the three-month period ended Dec 31, 2017, outperforming the industry’s rally of 8.2%.Fifth Third Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise Fifth Third Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise | Fifth Third Bancorp QuoteWill the upcoming earnings release give a boost to Fifth Third’s stock? That depends largely on whether the firm is able to impress market with its fourth-quarter results.Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsExpenses Might Increase Slightly: Fifth Third’s ongoing strategic investments in several areas, such as technology, will increase expenses. However, the company might be successful in offsetting the expense rise through its North Star initiatives to some extent.Net Interest Income (NII) to Improve: The quarter witnessed a moderate improvement in lending — particularly on the consumer front. Thus, loan growth, combined with a rise in interest rates, is likely to boost the company’s NII.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $1.58 billion indicates 3.1% year-over-year growth.Fee Income Might Remain Flat: Fifth Third’s focus on strengthening its fee income base through North Star initiatives is likely to lend support. Also, higher credit card revenues due to seasonality along with improved investment banking business will increase the non-interest income. However, poor mortgage banking revenues during the quarter are likely to offset the positives.Let’s have a look at what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model doesn’t conclusively show that Fifth Third will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time around, as it does not have the right combination of two key ingredients.

328,TROW,"State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and 2017 results before the market opens on Jan 23. Its quarterly earnings and revenues are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, an increase in revenues drove the company’s operating earnings growth. In fact, the number outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, higher expenses and a decline in trading servicing fees were the downsides.State Street boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 8.3%.State Street Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  State Street Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | State Street Corporation QuoteAlso, activities of the company during the fourth quarter encouraged analysts to revise estimates upward. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the to-be-reported quarter increased 1.2% to $1.71 over the last 30 days. Also, the figure represents a year-over-year improvement of 15.5%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $2.98 billion for the quarter, reflecting 17.7% year-over-year growth.Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsStable net interest income (NII): The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of $186.9 billion for the quarter represents a decline of 6.2% year over year. Further, overall lending activities were decent in the quarter. This, along with higher interest rates is expected to boost the company’s NII, but lower interest earning assets are likely to offset this gain to some extent.Notably, management expects NII to be relatively stable sequentially on the assumption of a slightly smaller balance sheet. Net interest margin is projected to increase a few basis points, driven by asset repricing and continued liability management.For 2017, management projects NII to be in the $2.43-$2.45 billion range. This takes into consideration interest rate expectations across the curve and currencies. Apart from this, NII growth will depend on the size of balance sheet, client deposit behavior, balance sheet management activity and the impact of FX swap costs.Balance sheet is expected to modestly decline in 2017, owing to lower client deposits and a fall in wholesale CD levels along with decrease in the average earning assets of roughly 0% to 5%.Muted fee revenue growth: Driven by the benefits of the acquired GE Asset Management business, management fees are likely to improve in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, on a sequential basis, management expects servicing fees to rise. However, lower market volatility is expected to lower trading revenues.In 2017, fee revenues (on an operating basis) are projected to increase above the 6-7% range. This was based on the assumptions of the market conditions as of October 2017, the U.S. dollar remaining stable relative to major currencies and benefits from GE Asset Management deal.Modest rise in expenses: Management expects operating expenses to rise slightly from the third-quarter level, mainly due to costs associated with new business activity. Expense level will also be dependent on the revenue backdrop in the quarter and the onboarding of new clients.For 2017, the company anticipates State Street Beacon expense savings of at least $140 million to partially offset expenses to support new business, continued business investments, and merit and depreciation increases.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:State Street does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for State Street is -0.15%.Zacks Rank: State Street has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

329,TROW,"Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (HBAN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Jan 23, before the opening bell. The company’s revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.The company’s fourth-quarter results are expected to be supported by robust organic growth and benefits from the FirstMerit acquisition (completed in Aug 2016).Rising interest rates might have worked in favor too. Though flatter yield curve offsets the benefits to some extent, pressure on Huntington’s net interest margin is likely to ease slightly from the three rate hikes in 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.10 billion for revenues indicates a 3.3% year-over-year improvement.Huntington has a decent earnings surprise history. It surpassed the earnings estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 4.4%.Huntington Bancshares Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Huntington Bancshares Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Huntington Bancshares Incorporated QuoteLast quarter, the company’s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Higher revenues, continual growth in both loan and deposit balances, and lower provisions were among the positives. However, higher net charge-offs were the primary headwind.Activities of Huntington during the fourth quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. Thus, over the last seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings has remained stable at 26 cents. Nevertheless, it reflects a year-over-year improvement of 8.3%.Notably, Huntington’s fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 14.4% in the past six months, outperforming the 12.3% growth recorded by the industry.Will the stock’s rally continue post fourth-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up.Earnings WhispersAccording to our proven model, we cannot conclusively predict if Huntington will beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time. That’s because, it doesn’t have the right combination of two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Huntington currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors That Might Influence Q4 ResultsRevenues Might Grow: Revenues are likely to improve in line with the company’s long-term financial goals, supported by synergies from the FirstMerit acquisition. Also, increasing net interest margin and a decent loan growth during the quarter will enhance net interest income. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest-earning assets of $93.9 billion reflects 1.1% sequential growth.Further, management expects the total revenue for 2017 to grow about 23% year over year.Expenses Likely to Increase: Management believes that all the cost savings related to the acquisition of FirstMerit have been achieved in the last quarter. They have now shifted their focus to revenue growth that is likely to push up expenses in this quarter. For full-year 2017, the company expects the non-interest expense growth to be nearly 13%.Credit Quality Might Deteriorate: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for allowance for loan and lease losses of $686 million shows a 1.6% increase from the last quarter. Also, net charge-offs are projected to be $43.1 million, reflecting a marginal sequential increase.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Earnings ESP for Legg Mason, Inc.

331,TROW,"Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report) is slated to announce fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results on Jan 22, after market close. Its revenues and earnings for the quarter are projected to grow year over year.Last quarter, Zions’ earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Higher net interest income and lower provisions aided results. Also, loan growth remained strong. However, higher adjusted non-interest expenses and lower non-interest income were the undermining factors.Notably, the company boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three and matched in one of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 11.5%.However, Zions’ activities in the fourth quarter failed to encourage analysts to revise earnings estimates. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 73 cents for the to-be-reported quarter remained stable over the last seven days. Nevertheless, it reflects year-over-year improvement of 21.7%.The company’s strong fundamentals have helped its shares to gain 18.1% in 2017, outperforming the industry’s growth of 7%.Zions Bancorporation Price and EPS Surprise  Zions Bancorporation Price and EPS Surprise | Zions Bancorporation QuoteWill the rally in stock price continue post Q4 earnings release? To a great extent, it depends on the company’s ability to maintain its trend of beating earnings estimates. Let’s take a look at what our quantitative model predicts.A Likely Positive Surprise?According to our quantitative model, chances of Zions beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is needed for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Zions is +0.36%.Zacks Rank: Zions carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP.Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsGiven the rise in interest rates, along with modest improvement in lending witnessed in the fourth quarter, Zions’ net interest income is likely to improve. While a slight rise in funding costs is expected to hurt NII to some extent, management projects the same to rise moderately in 2017, driven by continued growth in loans and securities.Further, driven by treasury management, mortgage and wealth management, the company projects non-interest income (excluding dividends and securities gains/losses) to increase in mid-single digit rate.Thus, improvement in both NII as well as non-interest income should lead to higher revenues in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the fourth quarter is $670.6 million, which reflects improvement of 10.2% year over year.However, despite taking a number of initiatives to control costs, the company’s adjusted non-interest expenses are expected to increase 2-3% year over year in 2017 due to its continued spending on technology systems overhaul and normal salary adjustments.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Synovus Financial Corp.

332,TROW,"BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Jan 18, before the market opens. The company’s tax equivalent net interest income (NII), one of the main sources of revenues, is expected to remain more or less stable sequentially.Even though, the fourth quarter witnessed an overall modest improvement in lending, per the Fed’s latest data, commercial and industrial loan growth has declined sequentially. Also, BB&T expects total loans, on an annualized basis, to decline sequentially, while core loan growth is anticipated to be in the range of only 2-4%.Moreover, despite a higher rate environment, the company projects core and GAAP NIM to be down 3-5 bps sequentially in the quarter on expectations of higher funding cost and asset mix change.Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for tax-equivalent NII of $1.68 billion for the fourth quarter shows marginal decline on a sequential basis. Also, management expects NII to remain stable from the prior quarter.Now, let’s check out other factors that might influence BB&T’s Q4 performance:Slightly Higher Non-Interest Income: Refinancing boom is nearing its end and higher interest rates are leading to reduced mortgage originations. This time seasonality also hurt mortgage banking revenues. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for mortgage banking income of $102 million reflects a decline of 10.5% sequentially.Also, despite rising deposit balances, the company is not expected to register a significant increase in service charge on deposits. The consensus estimate for service charge on deposits is $179 million, stable from the prior quarter.However, BB&T is expected to register higher insurance income in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for insurance fees is $422 million, rising 6.3% from the prior quarter.Thus, overall, total non-interest income is projected to witness a slight sequential rise as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is $1.17 billion.Stable Expenses: Excluding merger-related and restructuring charges, BB&T expects expenses in the fourth quarter to remain flat on a year-over-year basis.Asset quality to support results: BB&T expects loan loss provision to match net charge-offs (NCOs) in addition to providing for loan growth. Also, management expects NCOs rates to remain in the range of 0.40-0.50%, up sequentially.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:According to our quantitative model, chances of BB&T beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BB&T is +0.33%.Zacks Rank: BB&T carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the to-be-reported quarter is 79 cents, which reflects year-over-year improvement of 8.2%.

335,TROW,"Investors in T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (TROW  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 19, 2018 $70.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for T. Rowe Price Group shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, T. Rowe Price Group is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Financial - Investment Management industry that ranks in the Top 23% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, five analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one has dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.43 per share to $1.48 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about T. Rowe Price Group right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

This is because, it has the right combination of two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Zions is +1.61%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 63 cents is above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents.Zacks Rank: Zions carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This further increases the predictive power of ESP.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsManagement expects net interest margin to benefit from the Mar 2017 rate hike. Also, we believe that increasing yields and growth in investment securities portfolio will boost margins to some extent in the to-be-reported quarter.This is expected to have some positive impact on net interest income (NII) in the second quarter. Further, a modest improvement in loans will support NII.Zions has been undertaking several initiatives to control costs. Though its cost-saving efforts are likely to reduce operating expenses to some extent, the company’s continued spending on technology systems overhaul and normal salary adjustments will keep overall expenses stable during the quarter.Zions’ oil and gas-related exposure (9.4% of net loans) remains a matter of concern, despite a recovery in oil prices. Though the company expects energy-related losses to be lower year over year, oilfield services portfolio is likely to hamper significant improvement in asset quality. Hence, overall provisions should remain elevated during the quarter.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some other finance stocks worth considering, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.T.

340,TROW,"Stock market futures are down pretty deeply into the red this morning, after an average close on the main indexes of roughly half a percentage point. However, no blame can be placed on Q4 earnings season, which continues to bring about robust results from companies across the spectrum of industries. Asian markets were down slightly overnight, and later this evening we await President Trump’s initial State of the Union address. Later this week, beginning tomorrow, we start to see new data on January jobs numbers.Keeping with Q4 earnings results, here are 4 leaders in their respective spaces and how well they have performed relative to expectations, particularly the Zacks consensus estimates:McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) posted strong quarterly numbers both on top- and bottom-lines ahead of the opening bell today. Earnings of $1.71 per share easily outpaced the $1.59 expected. Revenues reached $5.34 billion in the company’s Q4, ahead of the $5.26 billion in the Zacks consensus.Beating estimates is nothing new for McDonald’s, whose previous average positive earnings surprise over the past 4 quarters was over 5%. In the quarter just reported, McDonald’s benefited from stronger comps, up 5.5% year over year. For more on MCD’s earnings, click here.Big Pharma player Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) also beat estimates on both earnings and revenues, with 62 cents per share on $13.70 billion in sales topping the 56 cents and $13.61 billion expected, respectively. Earnings growth year over year was a nice 32%, while revenues were up 1%. Revenue guidance for full-year 2018 remains in range of the current Zacks consensus estimate, whereas earnings guidance of between $2.90-3.00 per share is out ahead of the $2.77 we had earlier expected. For more on PFE’s earnings, click here.Health insurance major Aetna (AET  -  Free Report), on the other hand, posted mixed results for its Q4, with $1.23 per share surpassing the $1.18 we were looking for, but revenues of $14.74 billion lower than the $14.89 billion expected, and down further from the $15.72 billion a year ago. Enrollment is down as Congress continues to chip away at the Affordable Care Act, which was good for Aetna: the previous 4 quarters generated an average 23% positive earnings surprise. For more on AET’s earnings, click here.Global asset management firm T. Rowe Price (TROW  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, also posted earnings and revenue beats for its Q4 report: $1.52 per share outperformed the Zacks consensus by 7 cents, while the $1.29 billion in revenues did better than the $1.27 billion estimated and the $1.09 billion in the year-ago quarter.

342,TROW,"T. Rowe Price Group (TROW  -  Free Report) is taking steps to base its European operations in Luxembourg post Brexit, per a Financial Times article.The investment companies are putting their plans into action after the European Commission warned the U.K.-based fund companies that they could be banned from selling products in the European Union (EU) from April 2019.Recently, the company applied to the Luxembourg’s financial regulator to separate its U.K. and Luxembourg operations.The decision to move operations from London to Luxembourg was taken in 2017 and Robert Higginbotham, head of global investment services at T.Rowe Price, expects the new unit to be ready by summer this year.The asset manager already has European operations in Madrid, Milan, Zurich, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Copenhagen and Stockholm. Higginbotham expects EU offices to be able to report to the Luxembourg entity by the end of 2018.The shifting of operations would not affect jobs in the United Kingdom, while new positions would be available in Luxembourg.Financial Times quoted Higginbotham, “All this is based on what we know about Brexit at the moment — which will probably be about 25 per cent of what we know in a year’s time. We have been working on this for a year and will have to get it complete by the end of the year.”  T.Rowe Price is not the only asset manager that is weighing up its Brexit contingency plans. Per an EY survey that involved about 55 asset and wealth managers, overseeing a combined investment of €25 trillion, half are working on or planning to expand their European operations in an attempt to protect themselves from the impacts of Brexit.T.Rowe Price’s organic growth remains impressive as can be seen from a continuous rise in revenues. Also, its strategic initiatives, including investment in technology and advisory services, bode well for the long term.Shares of T.Rowe Price have gained 55.2% over the past year, outperforming 20.2% rally for the industry it belongs to.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

345,TROW,"Regions Financial Corporation (RF  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results tomorrow, before the opening bell. Both revenues and earnings are anticipated to grow year over year, with likely earnings beat on the cards.Before we discuss why an earnings beat is likely and what could influence the results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the last quarter.    This Birmingham, AL-based company’s third-quarter 2017 earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Easing margin pressure and lower expenses were the positive factors. Decline in non-interest income, along with lower loans and deposits balance, were the undermining factors. Moreover, provisions escalated in the quarter.Notably, post earnings, an appreciation in the company’s share price were recorded. For the three-month period ended Dec 31, 2017, the stock gained around 13.5%.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged at 26 cents over the last 30 days, reflecting a year-over-year improvement of nearly 13%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.45 billion indicates around 5.2% growth from the prior-year quarter.In addition, Regions is expected to record slight decline on a sequential basis in average interest-earning assets as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is $108.8 billion.Regions has an impressive earnings surprise history, as evident from the chart below: Regions Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Regions Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Regions Financial Corporation QuoteWill the upcoming earnings release give a boost to Regions’ stock? This depends largely on whether the firm is able to post a beat in the fourth quarter. Notably, our quantitative model predicts likely earnings beat this time. Here’s why:Our proven model indicates that chances of Regions beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate is high as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at +0.83%. This is a very significant and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company.Zacks Rank: The combination of Regions’ Zacks Rank #1 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsLoan Growth: Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans declined on a sequential basis during the December-end quarter. Particularly, growth in consumer loans, with slowdown in real estate loans, along with commercial and industrial (C&I) loans, is expected. Therefore, interest income for banks is projected to improve marginally.In addition, management’s expectations of loan and deposit growth in 2017 will likely be reflected in this quarter. The bank projects average loans to be marginally down on a year-over-year basis, excluding the impact of the third-party indirect-vehicle portfolio.Modest Rise in Net Interest Income (NII): Given the effect of rise in interest rates, Regions is expected to have recorded an increase in NII. Notably, management’s projections of the 2017 NII and other financing income to grow in the range of 3-5% are likely to show impact in the fourth quarter as well. For Q4, excluding the influence of interest recoveries, net interest income and net interest margin are likely to grow modestly in line with market expectations for the December Fed funds rate increase.Non Interest Income Might Escalate: The persistent decline in non-interest income has weighed on the top line for the last few years. Nevertheless, adjusted non-interest income is estimated to remain stable. Management expects a pick-up in capital markets revenues, along with modest growth in wealth management, mortgage and card, and ATM fees to contribute to overall growth in adjusted non-interest income during the quarter under review.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for capital market revenues is estimated to improve 9.4% sequentially to $38.3 million, while commercial credit fee income is projected to increase 6.5% to $18.1 million.Expenses Might Rise Slightly: Regions’ efficient expense management might decently support the bottom line during the quarter. Notably, the company is on track for a $400-million expense reduction by 2019, with mostly to be achieved by 2017. While investing in revenue-generating areas, the company intends to keep expenses from stable to a marginally elevated level.Adverse impact of new tax code: The tax reform might result in elevated operating expenses from one-time bonus payments, higher charitable contributions and investment losses from securities portfolio restructurings. Also, though the company has not provided any information about the write-down of deferred tax assets (DTAs), it might record a significant one-time charge in the quarter.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Earnings ESP for Legg Mason, Inc.

346,TROW,"With revenues and earnings projected to grow year over year, we expect T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (TROW  -  Free Report) to beat earnings expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Jul 25.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that T. Rowe Price is likely to beat on earnings in the second quarter. This is because the company has the combination of two key ingredients for a possible earnings beat – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at +2.38%. This is a very significant and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company.Zacks Rank: The combination of T. Rowe Price’s Zacks Rank #2 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.  Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated stocks) going into an earnings announcement.Below is the company’s earnings surprise history as depicted in the chart: T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. QuoteShares of T. Rowe Price gained 8.9% during the second quarter ended Jun 30, 2017, outperforming the 7.5% rally of the industry it belongs to.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsMutual Fund Products Performance: According to Morningstar data, T. Rowe Price witnessed around $5.6 billion of net outflows in U.S. mutual fund products in the to-be-reported quarter.However, the company is likely to record a rise in assets under management (AUM) as the second quarter experienced decent performance of equity markets. Notably, the S&P 500 index gained 3.1% in the quarter, which is likely to benefit T. Rowe Price, given its equity-heavy asset mix.Insignificant Fee Waivers: Management believes that with the gradually improving interest-rate environment, fee waivers in its money market mutual funds and trusts would be insignificant.Revenue Growth: T. Rowe Price’s efforts to improve its operating efficiency, has resulted in year-over-year growth in the top line over the past few years. We believe that the company is well poised to sustain the uptrend, going forward, on the back of several planned initiatives largely tied with launching investment strategies and vehicles, enhancing client engagement capabilities in each distribution channels, strengthening distribution channel in the U.S., EMEA, and the Asia Pacific, and improving its technology platform and deriving long-term cost efficiencies.Expenses to Escalate: The company did not point out anything related to its cost-control initiatives during the quarter, due to its several planned strategic initiatives. T. Rowe Price projects operating expenses for 2017 at growth rate of 10% (excluding the charge tied with the Dell appraisal rights matter). Notably, T. Rowe Price is anticipating capital expenditures in 2017 to be approximately $200 million, including two-third for technology development.Notably, this investment manager could not win analysts’ confidence during the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged at $1.26, over the last seven days.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.OM Asset Management PLC  is scheduled to report second-quarter results on Aug 3.

347,TROW,"Navient Corporation’s (NAVI  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 adjusted core earnings per share (EPS) of 43 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents. However, the figure came below the year-ago quarter tally.

It may also issue term asset-backed securities (ABS).During the reported quarter, Navient issued $1 billion in FFELP Loan ABS and $552 million in unsecured loan debt. Also, the company retired or repurchased $254 million of senior unsecured debt during the quarter.Share RepurchaseDuring the quarter, Navient repurchased 10.9 million shares of common stock for $165 million.Our TakeNavient’s top line continues to remain under pressure. However, we believe that the company will maintain its leadership position in the student-lending market through various growth avenues, including acquisition of loan portfolios. Additionally, economic recovery and declining unemployment rate are likely to fortify its business prospects as well as help borrowers in repaying their loans.Navient Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Navient Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Navient Corporation QuoteNavient currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

348,TROW,"E*TRADE Financial Corporation (ETFC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 20. While top line is expected to grow year-over-year, earning per share will likely remain flat.In the previous quarter, E*TRADE Financial’s earnings had surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9 cents. Increased net revenue and a benefit from provisions aided results. Further, the quarter witnessed an increase in daily average revenue trades along with growth in customer accounts. However, the positives were partially offset by higher expenses.Notably, E*TRADE Financial delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 20.7%.The stock has gained 8.6% over the last six months versus the Zacks categorized Financial - Investment Bank industry’s decline of nearly 1%.E*TRADE Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise E*TRADE Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | E*TRADE Financial Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersWill the upcoming earnings release give a further boost to the E*TRADE’s stock? A lot depends on whether the firm posts a beat for the fifth straight quarter. However, our quantitative model does not conclusively predict a beat. Here’s why:E*TRADE doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or at least 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for E*TRADE is 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate matches the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents.Zacks Rank: E*TRADE’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise. Factors Influencing Q2 ResultsMargin Pressure to Ease: The rate hikes in 2017 are likely to ease margin pressure. However, lower treasury yields might curb this improvement to some extent.Growth in Client Assets: On the back of decent equity performance in the quarter, evident from 3% growth in the S&P 500 Index, it is likely that the company will experience a rise in client assets.Lower Trading Revenues: Owing to low volatility in the bond and equity markets, E*TRADE Financial’s trading revenues might decline in the second quarter.Activities of E*TRADE during the quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter remained stable over the last seven days.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some stocks worth considering, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Artisan Partners Asset Management Inc. (APAM  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter results on Jul 24. It has an Earnings ESP of +1.72% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.T. Rowe Price Group, Inc.’s (TROW  -  Free Report) Earnings ESP is +2.38% and it carries a Zacks Rank #2.

349,TROW,"Tuesday, January 30, 2018Stock market futures are down pretty deeply into the red this morning, after an average close on the main indexes of roughly half a percentage point. However, no blame can be placed on Q4 earnings season, which continues to bring about robust results from companies across the spectrum of industries.

Earnings of $1.71 per share easily outpaced the $1.59 expected. Revenues reached $5.34 billion in the company’s Q4, ahead of the $5.26 billion in the Zacks consensus.Beating estimates is nothing new for McDonald’s, whose previous average positive earnings surprise over the past 4 quarters was over 5%.

For more on AET’s earnings, click here.Global asset management firm T. Rowe Price (TROW  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, also posted earnings and revenue beats for its Q4 report: $1.52 per share outperformed the Zacks consensus by 7 cents, while the $1.29 billion in revenues did better than the $1.27 billion estimated and the $1.09 billion in the year-ago quarter.

352,TROW,"Investment management (part of the broader Finance sector) industry performed reasonably well over the past several quarters. This time as well, the industry is expected to report decent results.As the equity market volatility remained low, increase in equity-based assets is expected. While the S&P 500 Index gained 3.1% in the quarter, it underperformed both non-U.S. developed and emerging markets. Hence, asset managers with global presence are expected to record a rise in equity asset under management (AUM).Further, rising interest rates are expected to lead to decline in fee waivers. Also, demand for alternative investment sources might have aided revenue growth for the investment managers. However, rise in operating expenses, as they aggressively market their products, is expected to slightly hurt the bottom line.Notably, per the Earnings Preview, overall earnings growth for the Investment managers in second-quarter 2017 is expected to be 6.9%.So, this is the right time to add a few investment management stocks in case they beat earnings estimates.Our quantitative model offers some insights into stocks that are about to report their earnings.

359,TROW,"U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 18, before the opening bell. The bank’s revenues and earnings are anticipated to be up year over year.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that U.S. Bancorp is likely to beat on earnings in the third quarter. This is because the company has the combination of the two key ingredients for a possible earnings beat — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for the stock is currently pegged at +0.26%. This is a very significant and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company.Zacks Rank: The combination of U.S. Bancorp’s Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.  Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement.Notably, U.S. Bancorp delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the four trailing quarters, with an average beat of 1.23% as depicted in the chart below:U.S. Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise U.S. Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise | U.S. Bancorp QuoteRegarding the stock’s performance, shares of the company gained around 3.2% for the three-month period ended Sep 30, 2017, underperforming growth of 3.9% recorded by the industry.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsExpenses Might Trend Higher: While the absence of considerable legal expenses is a positive, increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings might escalate costs moderately.Slight rise in net interest income (NII) on modest loan growth: Improvement in loan demand, particularly commercial and industrial, and consumer loans during the to-be-reported quarter will likely support the company’s NII.Consumer Revenue Growth: It is anticipated that an improving economy will spur consumer activity, which will help both payments businesses and consumer lending businesses. An improved economic backdrop will also lead to a rise in business spending on development and capital investments.Mortgage Banking Likely to Improve:  Higher mortgage banking is projected on stronger origination volumes. Expectations of a higher rate environment might have encouraged refinancing activities during the quarter under review. Nevertheless, with the refinance boom nearing its end, no major help is expected from this segment. So, the contribution of mortgage revenues to total revenues will not be much. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for mortgage banking revenue is $215 billion, relatively stable year over year.Activities of U.S. Bancorp during the quarter to be reported were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter remained unchanged at 88 cents over the last seven days. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is projected at $5.6 billion, up 4.9% year over year.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.T.

364,TROW,"The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc (RBS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 27, before market open. Its earnings are projected to grow year over year, while revenues are expected to witness a decline.Last quarter, the company reported improved earnings. Results were driven by higher revenues along with lower expenses.However, activities of the company in the third quarter failed to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 15 cents remained stable over the last 30 days. Nevertheless, the figure reflects year-over-year improvement of 50%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $4.19 billion for the to-be-reported quarter, which is expected to witness a decline of 3.6%.Driven by the gradual improvement in the macroeconomic backdrop, shares of the company have gained 58.4% on the NYSE in a year’s time, outperforming the 25.1% growth of the industry it belongs to.Royal Bank Scotland PLC (The) Price and Consensus  Royal Bank Scotland PLC (The) Price and Consensus | Royal Bank Scotland PLC (The) QuoteRBS, which was bailed out with £45 billion by the British government in 2008, has been striving for growth with several restructuring initiatives. These include cost-reduction measures, reducing geographic footprint and capital build-up efforts, while remaining focused on its strategy to become a smaller and simpler bank.The bank’s ability to cope with the broader industry challenges amid its overhauling moves remains a key area to watch out for this earnings season. So, will the upcoming earnings release lead to further improvement in RBS’ share price?Before getting into a detailed discussion on the factors that are likely to affect Q3 results, let’s check what our quantitative model predicts.According to our quantitative model, it cannot be conclusively predicted if RBS will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time around. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for RBS is 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 15 cents matches the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Zacks Rank: RBS has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsThe Edinburgh-based banking giant has been experiencing a decline in net fees and commissions for the past few quarters and we do not expect this quarter to display substantial strength. Moreover, the company has downsized its investment banking division, which is likely to witness a decline.As the bank remains focused on expediting its ongoing overhaul, the quarterly results are likely to be marred by further significant restructuring charges. Also, given RBS’ exposure to numerous lawsuits and investigations, the company might have kept additional reserves for litigation expenses, which could dampen the bottom line to some extent.However, expense base might get some respite owing to RBS’ continued cost-control efforts. Additionally, the company might have benefited from the ongoing economic recovery (albeit at a slow pace) in the UK and Ireland — the major domestic markets.Notably, the bank plans to move majority of jobs to India in order to bring down compensation costs. This restructuring move is aimed at boosting the bank’s profitability.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.T.

365,TROW,"Moody's Investors Service, a rating arm of Moody's Corporation, affirmed the ratings of Legg Mason, Inc. (LM  -  Free Report). The outlook has been raised from negative to stable. Also, the company’s senior unsecured debt rating has been affirmed at Baa1.The ratings are based on Legg Mason’s progress on acquisitions along with improved investment performance. Also, continuous net inflows to its global distribution unit have led to stable rating. Lastly, stabilization of its credit profile as reflected by lower leverage supported the ratings.Reasons Behind the AffirmationLegg Mason’s senior unsecured rating of Baa1 is indicative of its strong business profile due to the acquisition spree it was involved in between late 2015 and early 2016, and a weaker financial profile. Its acquisition of EnTrust, Clarion and RARE Infrastructure have greatly diversified the product offerings and expanded scale of business. However, the debt level remains elevated from the level before these acquisitions. Moody’s is apprehensive of the pressure on Legg Mason’s financial flexibility due to lower margins and significant use of cash flow for share repurchases. Nevertheless, the concern of extensive cash use is partially mitigated by lower effective cash tax rate.Per Moody’s, Legg Mason’s performance of key products has improved greatly through past strategic moves. Also, revenues have increased on account of higher assets under management (AUM), organic and performance growth. Sales have grown on the back of the company’s initiatives to broaden the vehicles through which clients invest in its products, especially separately managed accounts. Also, its efforts to refine distribution strategy have resulted in continuous net inflows to its global distribution unit.Leverage as a multiple of EBITDA (per Moody’s calculation) stands at 3.3x, which is below of 3.8x as of March 2016, but is still considered to be high for an asset-manager rated Baa1. The improvement in leverage comes from cost efficiencies that have led to margin improvements and the use of $750 million of junior securities (to which Moody's assigns 25% equity credit).What Could Make Moody's Change the Ratings?Legg Mason’s ratings can be revised higher on account of improvement in its market position and asset resilience due to inflows in investment platforms and development of products and services offered. Lastly, total debt / EBITDA ratio of below 2 supported by sufficient excess liquidity would led to a higher rating.On the flip side, Legg Mason's long-term ratings could be downgraded if its AUM resiliency scores decline due to acceleration of net outflows of long-term assets or weak new sales and total debt/EBITDA ratio remains above 4.Shares of Legg Mason have gained 29.2% year to date, outperforming the 24.7% rally for the industry it belongs to.Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks That Warrant a LookBlackRock, Inc.’s (BLK  -  Free Report) Zacks Consensus Estimate have been revised slightly upward for the current year, in the past 60 days.

367,TROW,"Invesco Ltd. (IVZ  -  Free Report) has agreed to acquire the exchange-traded funds (ETF) business of Guggenheim Partners LLC for $1.2 billion. The deal, which is expected to be completed by the second quarter upon receiving necessary third-party approvals, will be funded using cash and debt.Earlier in August, there were reports of Invesco buying the entire retail business of Guggenheim Partners. However, per the final deal, only the latter’s ETF business, which is said to have assets under management (AUM) worth more than $30 billion is being purchased. Guggenheim’s ETF business includes a portfolio of fixed income securities that are traded under the name of BulletShares.This move is part of Invesco’s efforts toward expanding its asset class further. It will add to its already-expanding portfolio, which offers ETFs under the PowerShares label. Once the deal is complete, Invesco's ETF AUM is expected to be worth more than $196 billion globally, as of Aug 31, 2017.The deal should lead to further improvement in the company’s top line, which has been growing since the last few years, owing to continued improvement in its AUM balance. Moreover, Invesco believes that the transaction will help in expanding, strengthening and broadening its investment capabilities in the growing ETF market globally.Moreover, the acquisition is likely to enhance Invesco’s ability to provide solutions to its institutional and retail clients, both in the United States as well as globally so that they can better achieve their investment objectives.Invesco’s President and CEO, Martin L. Flanagan, said, “We've built and managed Invesco over many years with a single focus:  to help clients achieve their investment objectives. Guggenheim Investments' ETF business is highly complementary to Invesco's, and will enable us to provide one of the industry's most comprehensive and innovative ranges of smart beta ETFs, including fixed income, equal-weight and self-indexed product offerings. The addition enhances our ability to help meet client needs, which will help further accelerate the growth of our business.”Jerry W. Miller, Guggenheim Investments’ president, said, “Guggenheim Investments remains committed to delivering strong, risk-adjusted performance to clients by employing our rigorous and repeatable investment processes, as well as executing sound fundamental research and analysis. We are confident that Guggenheim ETF shareholders will find in Invesco the right partner and platform for our suite of distinctive and innovative ETF products, including one of the industry's leading equal-weight ETF offerings.”Shares of Invesco have gained 11.4% in a year’s time, underperforming the 27.2% growth for the industry it belongs to.Currently, Invesco carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks from the same space are Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC (OZM  -  Free Report), Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.

Rowe Price recorded $220 billion in target date retirement portfolios, which was marginally up from $219 billion in the prior month.Our ViewpointThough the company’s business model helps it diversify its AUM, regulatory restrictions and sluggish economic recovery might impair growth and escalate costs. Also, T. Rowe Price is subject to numerous regulations by the U.S. and non-U.S. regulators, which pose concerns for its operations and may even hurt profitability.So we believe, driven by these concerns, shares of T.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because T. Rowe Price Group is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for TROW in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.46 cents per share for TROW, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.44 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for TROW, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.50% heading into earnings season.T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

371,TROW,"Franklin Resources (BEN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and fiscal 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 26. While revenues are projected to improve year over year, earnings might decline.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Franklin has a high chance of beating Q4 earnings estimates. This is because the company has the right combination of two key ingredients for a possible earnings beat — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Currently, Franklin has an Earnings ESP of +0.56%.Zacks Rank: Franklin currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). Further, Franklin has an impressive earnings surprise history. It surpassed Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 10.6%.In the last quarter, the company reported in line earnings. Results reflected lower revenues and higher costs. Net outflows in the quarter were another headwind. However, increase in assets under management (AUM) was a positive factor.Franklin Resources, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Franklin Resources, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Franklin Resources, Inc. QuoteFactors That Might Influence Q4 ResultsStrong Market Performance to Benefit Franklin: Performance of equity markets remained strong in the July-September quarter. The S&P 500 Index gained nearly 4% in the quarter. Moreover, the index measuring international equity performance — the MSCI EAFE — climbed around 5%. This should benefit this California-based asset manager.Higher AUM: Given Franklin’s AUM disclosure for September 2017 and equity market rally, the results are expected to display higher AUM on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, the company is expected to record inflows mainly tied with Global Fixed Income asset class, Global Equity and U.S. Equity. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, total AUM for the to-be-quarter is expected to rise 1.4% to $743 million on a year-over-year basis.Increase in Revenues: Investment management fees, which marks a significant portion of the company’s revenues, might improve on the back of market strength. The consensus estimate for investment management fees of $1.1 billion reflects nearly 1% growth year over year. However, this increase is likely to be partially offset by sales and distribution fees which is projected to fall 0.7% year over year to $438 million in the to-be-reported quarter.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $1.64 billion indicates a year-over-year increase of 1.6%.Controlled Expenses: While Franklin expects information and technology expenses along with general and administrative costs to exhibit an uptick in the fiscal fourth quarter, compensation and benefits expenses are expected to decline.However, the company’s cost-control efforts have been successful in trimming expenses so far this year. We expect these efforts to support bottom-line growth to some extent.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Lazard Ltd.

372,TROW,"Regions Financial Corporation (RF  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results tomorrow, before the opening bell. While revenues and earnings are anticipated to be up year over year, we can’t conclusively predict a likely earnings beat.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might not be in store and what could influence the results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the last quarter.   This Birmingham, AL-based company’s second-quarter 2017 earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate owing to impressive growth in revenues aided by easing margin pressure. Further, the company recorded growth in loans, though deposits balance remained stable. Credit quality metrics also improved. Rise in adjusted operating expenses and decline in non-interest income were the undermining factors.Notably, this upbeat performance resulted in an appreciation of the company’s share price. For the three-month period ended Sep 30, 2017, the stock gained around 4%.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged at 25 cents over the last 30 days, reflecting a year-over-year improvement of 5.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.45 billion indicates around 1% growth from the prior-year quarter.In addition, Regions is projected to record slight decline on a sequential basis in average interest-earning assets as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is $109.7 billion.Regions has an impressive earnings surprise history, as evident from the chart below: Regions Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Regions Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Regions Financial Corporation QuoteWill the upcoming earnings release give a boost to Regions’ stock? This depends largely on whether the firm is able to post a beat in the third quarter. However, our quantitative model doesn’t conclusively point toward a likely earnings beat this time. Here’s why:Regions doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) — for increasing its chances of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Regions is +0.48%. This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Regions’ Zacks Rank #4 decreases the predictive power of ESP.It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsLoan Growth: Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans grew on a sequential basis during the third quarter. Improvement in loan demand, particularly commercial and industrial, and consumer loans during the to-be-reported quarter are anticipated to support the company’s net interest income.In addition, management’s expectations of loan and deposit growth in 2017 will likely be reflected in this quarter. The bank projects average loans to be flat to marginally down on a year-over-year basis, excluding the impact of the third-party indirect-vehicle portfolio. Average deposits are estimated to be relatively stable compared to the prior year.Modest Rise in Net Interest Income (NII): Given the effect of rise in interest rates, Regions should have recorded an increase in NII. Notably, management’s projections of the 2017 NII and other financing income to grow in the range of 3-5% are likely to show impact in the third quarter as well.Non Interest Income Might Escalate: The persistent decline in non-interest income has weighed on the top line for the last few years. Nevertheless, adjusted non-interest income is estimated to grow 1-3%. Management expects a pick-up in capital markets revenues, along with modest growth in wealth management, mortgage and card, and ATM fees to contribute to overall growth in adjusted non-interest income during the second half of the year.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for capital market revenues is estimated to improve sequentially to $41.4 million, while commercial credit fee income is projected to remain stable at $18.2 million.Expenses Might Rise Slightly: Regions’ efficient expense management might decently support the bottom line during the quarter. Owing to the current global macroeconomic headwinds, management’s plan to slash $300 million of core expenses by 2018 is right on track. Furthermore, encouraged by recent increases in market interest rates, Regions expects to eliminate an additional $100 million by 2019.However, the company projects adjusted expenses to trend from a flat to 1% increase, while efficiency ratio is expected to scale at approximately 62% in 2017. Adjusted operating leverage is projected in the range of 2-4%.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.T.

373,TROW,"With revenues and earnings projected to grow year over year, T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (TROW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Oct 26.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that T. Rowe Price is likely to beat on earnings in the third quarter. This is because the company has the combination of two key ingredients for a possible earnings beat — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at +3.25%. This is a very significant and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company.Zacks Rank: The combination of T. Rowe Price’s Zacks Rank #2 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.  Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated stocks) going into an earnings announcement.Below is the company’s earnings surprise history as depicted in the chart: T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. QuoteShares of T. Rowe Price gained around 22.2% during the third quarter (ended Sep 30, 2017), outperforming the 8.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsMutual Fund Products Performance: According to the Morningstar data, T. Rowe Price witnessed around $2.9 billion of net inflows in U.S. mutual fund products in the to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, the company is likely to record a rise in assets under management (AUM) as the third quarter experienced decent performance of equity markets. Notably, the S&P 500 index gained 4.5% in the quarter, which is likely to benefit T. Rowe Price, given its equity-heavy asset mix. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for assets under management is $911 billion, up 4.6% sequentially.Insignificant Fee Waivers: Management believes with the gradually improving interest-rate environment, fee waivers in its money market mutual funds and trusts would be insignificant.Revenue Growth: T. Rowe Price’s efforts to improve its operating efficiency have resulted in year-over-year top-line growth over the past few years. We believe the company is well poised to sustain this upbeat uptrend, going forward, on the back of several planned initiatives largely tied with launching investment strategies and vehicles, enhancing client engagement capabilities in each distribution channels, strengthening distribution channel in the United States, EMEA, and the Asia Pacific, and improving its technology platform and deriving long-term cost efficiencies.Expenses to Escalate: The company did not point out anything related to its cost-control initiatives during the quarter, due to its several planned strategic actions. T. Rowe Price projects operating expenses for 2017 at growth rate of 10% (excluding the charge tied with the Dell appraisal rights matter) and 7% for 2018. Notably, the company is anticipating capital expenditures in 2017 to be approximately $200 million, including two-third for technology development.However, this investment manager could not win analysts’ confidence during the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged at $1.41, over the last seven days, reflecting a year-over-year improvement of 20.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.21 billion indicates around 10.6% growth from the prior-year quarter.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Lazard Ltd.

374,TROW,"E*TRADE Financial Corporation (ETFC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 19. While the top line is expected to grow year over year, earning per share will likely remain flat.In the last reported quarter, E*TRADE Financial reported a positive earnings surprise of 8.3%, supported by increased net revenues and benefit from provisions. Further, the quarter witnessed an increase in daily average revenue trades along with growth in customer accounts. However, the positives were partially offset by higher expenses.Notably, E*TRADE Financial delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 17%.The stock has gained 26.3% year to date, outperforming the industry’s rally of nearly 7%.E*TRADE Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise E*TRADE Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | E*TRADE Financial Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersWill the upcoming earnings release give a boost to E*TRADE stock?

As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter remained stable over the last seven days. Factors That Might Influence Q3 ResultsMargin Pressure Likely to Ease: The June 2017 rate hike is expected to make a full-quarter impact on net interest margin. However, a flat yield curve during the quarter might curb this improvement to some extent.Interest Expense Savings: The company’s expenses are expected to reduce on the back of its restructuring moves to lower debt level.Revenues Likely to Improve: Continued momentum in investment banking business is likely to support E*TRADE’s top line. Also, the revenue synergies from OptionHouse acquisition is expected to be partly reflected in the upcoming results. However, owing to low volatility in the bond and equity markets during the quarter, trading revenues are likely to remain low.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is projected to be $596.3 million, up 22.7% year over year.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks worth considering, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (AMTD  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter results on Oct 24.

376,TROW,"On Aug 21, 2017, we issued an updated research report on T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (TROW  -  Free Report). The company’s shares have gained 9.5% so far this year, underperforming the 16.5% growth of the industry it belongs to. This dismal performance stemmed from escalating expenses and near-term concerns related to investment advisory fees (comprising 88% of total revenue) as changes in the assets under management (AUM) due to market fluctuations and foreign exchange translations could hurt this revenue source of the company.Here are a few concerns forcing the stock to underperform the broader industry so far:  Firstly, growing operating expenses remain a major concern for T. Rowe Price. The company incurs significant expenditures to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from the existing ones. Notably, due to several planned strategic initiatives, T. Rowe Price projects operating expenses to rise 10% for 2017 (excluding the charge tied with Dell appraisal rights matter) and 7% for 2018.Secondly, in order to maintain a positive yield for fund investors, the company continues to waive fees in its money market mutual funds and trusts, which is likely to continue in 2017 at a very minimal level.Finally, over the last seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the stock remained stable at $5.77 for the current year.However, revenue growth, debt-free position with substantial liquidity and strong capital deployment activities are key strengths of T. Rowe Price. Investment in international growth funds is also likely to diversify the company portfolio, increasing both revenues and the investment management margin.In addition, the company remains focused on fortifying business via several initiatives namely, launching investment strategies and vehicles, enhancing client engagement capabilities in each distribution channel, strengthening distribution channels in the U.S., EMEA and Asia Pacific, improving technology platform and deriving long-term cost efficiencies.Currently, T. Rowe Price carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderLPL Financial Holdings Inc. (LPLA  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

377,TROW,"Following Old National Bancorp’s (ONB  -  Free Report) announcement of its decision to acquire Anchor Bancorp, Inc. in a stock and cash deal, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the company’s outlook from stable to negative. However, Old National’s long-term issuer and senior unsecured ratings were affirmed at A3.Although the acquisition will help Old National to expand its operations into the vibrant growth markets of Minnesota and add low-cost core deposits, Moody’s believes that it might hamper the company’s capital and liquidity position.Also, this out-of-market acquisition might increase the company’s credit and operational risks.Per Moody’s, Old National’s tangible common equity (TCE) to risk-weighted asset ratio has been declining for the last few years. Since the acquisition will expand the company’s risk-weighted assets and increase its goodwill, its capital ratios are likely to be pressurized further.Although, Old National’s capital and liquidity positions seem weak, the company boasts solid credit quality. It has a strong core deposit base and a solid earnings generation capacity, which helps it to maintain its sustainable market position in Indiana. Also, the company has been successful in managing credit risks in the past. It is on account of these positives that the company’s ratings were affirmed by Moody’s.According to Moody’s, a rating upgrade for Old National could happen only if the company is successful in improving its capital and liquidity position. On the other hand, the company’s ratings could be downgraded further if its capital or liquidity position does not bounce back to the prior levels and if its underwriting standards become more aggressive.Old National stock has gained nearly 22.1% in the last 12 months, underperforming the 24.1% growth for the industry it belongs to.Currently, the company carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some top-ranked stocks in the finance space worth considering are Carolina Financial Corporation (CARO  -  Free Report), The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) and T.
