0,UTX,"Boeing (BA) is reportedly considering development of two twin-aisle, midrange planes for what analysts have dubbed the ""797"" and is seeking proposals from engine makers.XThe aerospace giant still hasn't decided whether to go forward with what it calls a New Middle Market Airplane, or the NMA, as it tries to answer Airbus' (EADSY) A320neo. But details have emerged for two types of aircraft.One aircraft called the NMA-6X would seat 228 passengers and have a range of 5,000 nautical miles, while the other plane, the NMA-7X, would seat 267 in two classes, but the range would be 800 nautical miles shorter, sources told Air Current.Boeing is looking for an engine that would burn 25% less fuel per pound of thrust vs. the engines on the 757, according to the report, and gave engine makers CFM International, a General Electric (GE)-Safran joint venture, United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt and Whitney and the U.K.'s Rolls-Royce until June 27 to submit final proposals.Boeing shares edged down 0.45% at 329.82 on the stock market today, giving up gains amid a broad market reversal.

But sources told the Air Current that Boeing is making the engine decision well ahead of its possible launch.Boeing is having trouble with engine suppliers, who have struggled to keep up with rising production rates and addressing technical problems.Earlier this month, Rolls-Royce found another compressor flaw in its engine for some Boeing 787s, and Pratt and Whitney is struggling to boost production of its geared turbofan engine. GE is also in the midst of a massive restructuring.On June 20 Randy Tinseth, Boeing's VP of marketing, told IBD in Seattle that the current problems with engine makers won't affect the possibility of future deals. He called the issues a ""manageable situation.""Boeing has been shopping the midmarket airplane idea around to carriers for over a year. But few details have emerged about the new plane, which analysts are dubbing the ""797.""Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg last year confirmed that the new plane could seat roughly 250 passengers and have a range of 5,000 nautical miles. If the plane gets the green light for production, it wouldn't enter service until 2025.Tinseth wouldn't give more details about what airlines wanted from the new plane but said after speaking to 50 customers ""we are now at the point where we pretty much understand what they want.""""Our steps moving forward — can we develop a production system that makes sense. And once we develop that production system will the business case come together,"" he said.At the National Press Club in Washington D.C., Wednesday, Delta Air Lines (DAL) CEO Ed Bastian reaffirmed earlier statements that Delta wants to be a launch customer if Boeing goes ahead with the new plane to replace aging 767s and 757s that are set to retire in the next decade.""We have had discussion about being a potential launch customer but it would be premature to make any comment along those lines,"" he said. ""But we think Boeing is interested in getting a feel of the market.""Bastian wouldn't go into specifics about what the carrier wants from a ""797"" but he said he wants range and capacity at a low price point for customers.""Don't want an overload. Sometimes you build an aircraft with too much capability and too much range and that's when it becomes more expensive and you're suboptimal.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch

It is an early step in a long-term development plan that will have both commercial and military applications.""We're excited about the potential of hypersonic technology to connect the world faster than ever before,"" Kevin Bowcutt, senior technical fellow and chief scientist of hypersonics at Boeing, said in a news release. ""Boeing is building upon a foundation of six decades of work designing, developing and flying experimental hypersonic vehicles, which makes us the right company to lead the effort in bringing this technology to market in the future.""Boeing can boast an earlier hypersonic milestone: In 2015, its unmanned X-51 Waverider flew for more than six minutes and reached speeds of over Mach 5 for 210 seconds, marking the longest duration for a powered hypersonic flight.However, travelers will have to wait a while before taking to the skies in a hypersonic passenger jet. Bowcutt estimated such an aircraft will not take flight until 20 to 30 years in the future.There are numerous design challenges that make supersonic transportation difficult. These include excessive noise generation at takeoff due to sonic booms during flight, high development costs and expensive construction materials. The cost per seat is also much higher than subsonic airliners.Boeing shares rose10 cents at 331.30 on the stock market today. On Monday, ongoing U.S. trade tensions with China sent the stock as low as 327.60, triggering the 8% sell rule from a 365.10 cup-with-handle buy point on a weekly chart.

The Concorde was jointly developed and manufactured by France's Sud Aviation and the British Aircraft Corporation.The Concorde could fly at Mach 2, or twice the speed of sound, allowing it to travel from London to New York in three hours vs. about seven hours for a standard passenger jet.But at Mach 5, Boeing's concept jet would fly across the Atlantic in just two hours, though it's not clear if the plane would travel at Mach 5 for the whole duration of the flight. The jet would also be capable of crossing the Pacific in just three hours, while a typical nonstop flight from Los Angeles to Tokyo would take about 12 hours.In 2015, Airbus patented a hypersonic jet that it said would reach speeds as high as Mach 4.5. Dubbed the Concorde-2, it would be faster and quieter than the famed supersonic jet, and make a journey from New York to London in just one hour.Two turbo jets would allow the jet to climb vertically at takeoff, and would retract into the fuselage before it reaches the speed of sound. A rocket motor would then propel it even faster.Meanwhile, Boeing also said Tuesday that it has invested in parcel drone company Matternet.

The Nasdaq, which eased nearly 0.7% last week, gained as much as 1.1% intraday before cooling off.Meanwhile, the continued positive breadth of the market could be witnessed by the fact that three companies in three separate sectors continued to build a case for a potential breakout: Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL), farm machinery giant Deere (DE) and HR management software expert Workday (WDAY).The Dow Jones industrial average, meanwhile, held most of the day's gains as it closed more than 1% higher.

18,UTX,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) is gunning for a massive bulk order of F-35s to slash production costs, while Pentagon leaders weigh the expense of modernizing the stealth fighters that have already been produced.X The convergence of efforts is a product of the F-35's $400 billion acquisition strategy, which is to simultaneously produce jets and continue their development.Pentagon officials and Lockheed have for years pushed for a so-called block buy of F-35s, and a plan is going to be officially unveiled later this month. The purchase would include hundreds of the jets in a single multibillion dollar contract in the early 2020s to enable economies of scale. But such a deal would also involve more upfront costs.""Ultimately we all share the same enemy: cost. Our focus remains on achieving an $80 million airplane by 2020 and (we) believe the biggest levers to reduce cost beyond that are the use of economic order quantities, cost reduction initiatives, and a multiyear contract,"" Lockheed VP Jeff Babione, the firm's F-35 program leader, told the Wall Street Journal.However, it may face challenges as senior Pentagon officials have been frustrated by efforts to cut the cost of buying and flying the advanced combat planes over the past three years. This is despite Lockheed already trimming the average price of the F-35A to $95 million, from $122 million five years ago, with an aim to cut it further to $80 million by the end of the decade.Defense leaders are demanding more cuts, as annual production is already set to climb from 66 last year to around 150 jets in the early 2020s.Lockheed Martin stock finished 0.1% lower at 341.78 on the stock market today. Northrop Grumman (NOC), a major F-35 subcontractor, also dipped 0.1%, while United Technologies (UTX), which is building the engines for the F-35, edged up 0.3%.The tab is also coming due to modernize the more than 270 jets currently flying, and it could hit $16 billion.Citing the information provided by the Pentagon, Rep. Niki Tsongas said at a recent House Armed Services Committee hearing that costs will be split between $10.8 billion for software development and $5.4 billion for deploying the updates and other procurement expenses in support of the modernization efforts, according to Reuters.F-35 Joint Program Office head Vice Admiral Mathias Winter said the figure is the outer limit of the modernization costs however, and said the updates will enhance the jets' capabilities, bringing them to their maximum potential.""Continuous enhancements and improvements will be made to increase capabilities that make the F-35 more lethal and survivable,"" Winter told lawmakers.Meanwhile, the F-35's costs were an issue in Italy's recent election, and the Five Star party, which has vowed to scrap the country's participation in the F-35 program, is edging closer to to power.Italy is due to purchase 60 F-35As and 30 F-35Bs, at a cost of $14 billion, and has already taken delivery of nine F-35As from its own final assembly line at Cameri in northern Italy, according to Defense News.The Pentagon's other top combat aircraft program, the B-21 Raider bomber, is said to be on track despite production problems with the the engines and wings, including an air flow issue.House Armed Services Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee chair Rob Wittman, R-Va., hailed the work of prime contractor Northrop Grumman, particularly for how it has integrated its subcontractors together to solve the early design problems.""This is an extraordinary, complex aircraft. The issue is not that you have these uncertainties. The issue is how you address them,"" Wittman told Defense News at the McAleese/Credit Suisse defense conference.The B-21 is the most secretive program currently being undertaken by the U.S.The Air Force plans buy at least 100 of the aircraft for around $550 million each, with the total acquisition price tag estimated at up to $80 billion. They will replacing aging Cold War-era Boeing (BA) B-52s.United Tech's Pratt & Whitney unit is developing the engine for the aircraft. It is rumored to be a twin-engine, rather than a quad-engine, plane. Wittman said pushing enough air through the engines has proven to be a problem.""This is a very, very different design as far as airflow, and there have been some design challenges there,"" he said. ""It's not just the engine, but it's the ducting on the engine, too. I think all those things are elements that you would normally expect in an aircraft that's new, that takes a concept from B-2, refines and uses it on this platform.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Lockheed's F-35 Chief To Lead Skunk Works As Air Force Speeds 6th-Gen FighterDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsWhich Companies Are Now Outperforming 95% Of All Stocks?

27,UTX,"Major indexes, after catching their breath on Tuesday, struggled to hold on to early mild gains in Wednesday-morning trading and fell broadly. Meanwhile, leading leisure-sector play China Lodging (HTHT) got burned with big losses after reporting solid results, but still has the opportunity to form a new base.Among stocks in the 30-member Dow Jones industrial average, at least four members dropped 1 point or more, including industrial heavyweights Boeing (BA)and United Technologies (UTX). Boeing dropped 13.29 points, or nearly 4%, and undercut its 50-day moving average in heavy turnover.Boeing's big decline represents the first time the Dow Jones industrial component dropped below the medium-term support level since breaking out of a flat base at 185.81 in May 2017, and thus serves as a sell signal. Holders can consider taking at least partial profits. However, those with a very big profit cushion in Boeing can decide to sit tight and see if the stock does one or both of these two things: 1) form a constructive new base, such as a cup with handle, flat base or double bottom; or 2) find institutional buying support at or near the 50-day line or the longer-term 200-day moving average.Boeing has solid profit estimates from Wall Street (up 17% to $14.07 a share in 2018, up 19% in 2019), and the aerospace giant has halted a four-quarter slump in the top line as sales gained 2% and 9% vs. year-ago levels in the past two quarters.But some observers on Wall Street are watching closely for any signs of retaliatory measures that America's trading partners may take against key U.S. products, which could include aircraft.United Tech (the aircraft engine, elevator and security systems manufacturer) is forming a new base after breaking out of a saucer with handle at 123.38 on Dec. 11 and gaining as much as 13% before its latest correction.At 11:30 a.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite slumped 0.4% after opening with a gain of nearly 0.4%. The S&P 500 sank more than 0.5% and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 1%. Volume is running higher on the NYSE vs. the same time Tuesday.Soft U.S. retail sales for February (down 0.1%, vs. the Econoday forecast for a 0.4% pickup) did not initially spur widespread selling. But investors are expressing concerns over the impact that new U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum may have on global trade.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAs noted in The Big Picture column, the major indexes on Tuesday logged a fresh distribution day, or bout of intense professional selling, as the Nasdaq fell 1% in higher volume vs. the prior session. The S&P 500 dropped 0.6% as NYSE turnover edged higher. But with most leading stocks acting all right and the two key indexes now having retaken their respective 50-day moving averages, the market's current outlook remains at ""confirmed uptrend"" for now.Steel makers haven't made much headway in the wake of historic tariffs of 25% set on steel imports by President Trump, although the White House has set exemptions for Canada and Mexico amid three-party talks to rethink the Nafta trade treaty. However, the highly rated members of the group are generally holding up and are beating the S&P 500.U.S. Steel (X) fell more than 2% and is headed for a fifth down day in a row. Watch to see if institutional buying support can prevent a severe undercut of the stock's rising 50-day moving average.U.S. Steel holds a 92 RS Rating on a scale of 1 to 99. Shares are up 13% since Jan. 1, beating a 3.3% lift by the S&P 500.Wall Street expects U.S. Steel, which has a $7 billion market value and is thus a midcap firm, to increase earnings by 98% this year to $3.84 a share, then boost earnings by 17% in 2019 to $4.50.Tenaris (TS), part of IBD Leaderboard, and Steel Dynamics (STLD) are also group leaders, rising mildly after successful tests of support at their 50-day moving averages.Tenaris is slightly below a 36.43 buy point in a long, deep cup with handle.This week's pullback looks normal so far, given that Tenaris has rallied nicely for four weeks in a row.Notice on a MarketSmith weekly chart how in the week ended Feb. 9, while IBD's current outlook shifted to ""market in correction"" in The Big Picture column, Tenaris respected its 40-week line. That's bullish.The Street sees the expert in oil and gas well steel pipes increasing earnings 43% to $1.10 a share this year and 47% in 2019.Meanwhile, China Lodging (HTHT) dropped more than 10% to 131.70 in heavy turnover and gave back all of its year-to-date gains and then some. But the stock is trying to hold near the 130 level, where it found institutional buying support during the early February market sell-off. The stock is also trading above its long-term 200-day moving average for now.The hotel chain operator late on Tuesday notched an 86% jump in Q4 profit to 52 cents a share, accelerating from EPS gains of 19% and 58% in the prior two quarters, on a 42% rise in revenue to $340.1 million, the second highest for any quarter.After-tax margin jumped 290 basis points to 11.2%.Through Tuesday's close, China Lodging ranked No. 10 in the IBD 50. Shares had already made a stunning climb, rising more than 400% from a first-stage breakout from a cup without handle at 33.10 during the week ended March 18, 2016.This year, the midcap firm formed a new cup with handle, but it was a late-stage base (meaning the risk of failure was greatly elevated) and the stock hadn't yet broken out ahead of Q4 results.In other markets, crude oil was drifting near break-even after a report showed weekly U.S. inventories rose to 5 million barrels in the week ended March 9. WTI slipped 0.1% to $60.64 a barrel.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond fell to around 2.83%, off from a Feb. 21 high of around 2.94%. The Federal Reserve meets on interest rates on March 20-21 and is widely expected to increase the fed funds rate by a quarter point to a range of 2.25%-2.5%.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on stocks, investing, growth companies and financial markets.)RELATED:When To Sell Stocks: A Big Drop Through This Support Level Means Institutions Are Selling HardStocks Near A Buy ZoneIf The Stock Market Keeps Rising, Can You Spot This Rare Bullish Chart Pattern?Which Way Is The Stock Market Headed From Here?

GE stock now yields 3.2%.""We still see structural concerns in the key Power markets, minimal margin for error on leverage, numerous tail liabilities at both GE and GECS (General Electric Capital Services),"" JPMorgan's Stephen Tusa wrote in a note out Tuesday.The analyst noted that proceeds from shedding businesses will go toward the balance sheet, knocking ""assumptions that $20 billion of asset sales comes for free, with no lost"" earnings before interest and taxes, free cash flow (FCF).Tusa added: ""GE's 'normalized' level of FCF looks to be well below $1 (per share), with a plausible case of sustainable FCF in the $0.50 range, just above the standing dividend.""On the GE dividend, Tusa takes issue with those who espouse that the dividend yield is above the sector average.""The issue is that while it's not necessarily cut near term, it is not growing, and at a ~95% payout on post divestiture FCF, it's still high risk,"" he said.Tusa lowered his price target to $11 — a level last seen in mid-2009 — saying ""$0.50/$0.60 in 2018/2019 FCF does not support a $14 PT.""On the stock market today, shares of GE tumbled 4.4% to 14.43, trailing the 30 blue chip stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average.

32,UTX,"The F-35 is preparing for key operational tests that will allow Lockheed Martin (LMT) to begin full-rate production on the stealth fighter and massively boost its growth.XAcquisition rules require the completion of combat testing certification, or Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E), before Lockheed can crank out F-35s at full tilt.The F-35 underwent cold-weather testing at Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska, in February, as part pre-IOT&E activity. Then last month, the F-35 went through more pre-IOT&E tests at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., to evaluate close air support and combat search and rescue capabilities.Actual IOT&E, which includes rigorous combat testing, is scheduled to start in September (more than a year behind schedule) and finish by May 2019. That event will also test the F-35's 3F software package, which provides 100% of the coding needed for full warfighting capability.It will also pit the F-35 against the venerable A-10 in a close air support matchup that Congress mandated amid a fierce debate over the A-10's future.The F-35 is supposed to fill the close air support role left by the A-10, but critics say the stealthy fighter doesn't have the same amount of firepower or survivability in combat and instead called on the Air Force to put off the planned retirement of the so-called Warthog.Lockheed has a lot riding on the tests.The F-35 program is key to Lockheed's growth as it accounts for about 25% of total revenue. The company has been steadily boosting its production rate, but getting to full output would nearly double the pace.Lockheed delivered 66 F-35s last year, and sees production and delivery of 91 jets this year. By 2023, the company expects to reach 160 jets per year.Other defense stocks will also see a lift when F-35 output jumps. Northrop Grumman (NOC) builds the center fuselage and mission planning software, United Technologies (UTX) makes the engines, and Raytheon (RTN) is modifying its missiles and other weapons for the jet.Lockheed and Raytheon rose 0.5% in the stock market today while Northrop sank 0.55% and United Tech climbed 1.55%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

However, Boeing is the leader at the upper end, with the 787 Dreamliner outselling the Airbus A330neo.Boeing is currently aiming to snatch share in the midmarket. It is reportedly looking at launching an aircraft with a twin-aisle cabin and the smaller cargo space of a single-aisle plane, enabled by a novel shape designed to fly more efficiently.Analysts have dubbed the plane the ""797,"" though Boeing has said it hasn't decided yet on whether to move forward with the project.France-based Airbus has explored several proposals to stretch the advantage of the A321 as it looks to force Boeing to abandon its new plane, or to at least limit its impact.Airbus' A321LR is going into service this year. It has a maximum range of 4,000 nautical miles. This is a sizable advantage over the largest craft in Boeing's 737 series, the 737 MAX 10, as it only has a range of up to 3,300 nautical miles.Competition between the two aeronautical giants remains fierce. Last month Boeing appeared closer to taking control of Embraer's (ERJ) commercial jet business, after Brazil's defense minister signaled that worries about the military segment have been resolved.The interest in Embraer comes as it looks to fend off potential competition in smaller narrow-body jets from Bombardier's new C Series line.

40,UTX,"General Electric (GE) needs to boost its target for raising capital, even after its new transportation deal, to hit deleveraging targets, and may also have to consider another dividend cut, according to JPMorgan.GE still must come up with billions of dollars in additional capital to fix its balance sheet, analyst Steve Tusa wrote Tuesday, while reaffirming an underweight rating on GE shares and a year-end price target of 11.""With little available cash flow to naturally de-lever, we don't see how, from a risk mitigation perspective, a company of this size and complexity cannot be seriously considering at least a dividend cut and/or a more aggressive approach to reinforcing its capital base,"" he said.On Wednesday, CEO John Flannery warned there will be no profit growth at its core power business this year, adding that the company will see how its turnaround plans play out to determine the dividend.That may have been interpreted as leaving the door open to another cut, but sources told CNBC Thursday that GE doesn't have plans to cut its payout in 2019.Shares rallied 3% to 14.60 on the stock market today after diving 7% Wednesday on Flannery's bearish profit comments.JPMorgan's analysis followed news that GE's transportation unit will combine with Wabtec (WAB) in an $11.1 billion deal, providing GE with $2.9 billion in cash at the merger's close.But in Tusa's view, GE needs roughly $32 billion in capital, far more than its target of $20 billion in asset sales, to lower its debt-to-adjusted earnings ratio to 2.5.He identified possible sources of capital, saying its stake in Baker Hughes (BHGE) could be monetized for roughly $20 billion, while its stake in the merged Wabtec company could yield about $2 billion with other divestitures raking in $4.5 billion or so. But that would still leave a shortfall of $6 billion, Tusa said.Meanwhile, Reuters reported Tuesday that GE is looking for ways to sell off its insurance business, which forced the company to book a steep charge earlier this year.GE had promised in November to shed $20 billion in assets to soothe ratings agencies and find ""their way to get to 2.5x leverage,"" Tusa noted.But he found its leverage ratio is actually worse than generally accepted, estimating it at 4.4x vs. the 3.9x figure that Moody's (MCO) has estimated in its credit ratings.Moody's assumptions on GE's leverage recently ticked up from 3.2x in the fall of 2017, Tusa noted, after the firm included the impact of higher restructuring costs on earnings. Meanwhile, GE's pension obligations remain significant.Against that backdrop, the ""current dividend payout ratio remains too high for the company to deleverage over time simply from running its business,"" Tusa said.The stock bears a 48-cent annual dividend, yielding 3.1%, after the company sliced its dividend payout in half in November.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:If General Electric Breaks Up, Should You Break Up With GE's Stock?Boeing Pounces On Lion Air Deal; Stock Soars On China's XiGE Will Offload One Of Its Oldest Businesses In New CEO's Biggest Deal

44,UTX,"General Electric (GE) faces the most fundamental risk among multi-industry companies from rapidly rising steel and aluminum prices under President Trump's proposed tariffs — and that could chill takers for a business it's looking to shed, a Wall Street analyst said.X GE makes huge and heavy-duty industrial equipment made significantly of metal, such as jet engines for Boeing (BA) planes, generators for power plants and locomotives, Deutsche Bank's John Inch wrote in a Wednesday note. That raises both direct risk in terms of competitive cost pressures and indirect risk in terms of reduced global trade if other countries slap tariffs of their own, he added.""While the value/cost of GE's products are heavily weighted to the engineering performance features rather than the raw material costs, we believe that rising raw material costs (steel and aluminum) can nonetheless still pose significant spread headwinds (""value gap"") for GE,"" Inch said.GE countered the Deutsche Bank note in a statement, saying reports on the impact of potential steel and aluminum tariffs on GE's costs are completely ungrounded.""Our internal data shows our consumption of imported metals likely to be impacted by the tariffs is minimal,"" a GE spokesperson said. ""We are monitoring the situation as it develops.""Deutsche Bank's Inch cautioned that GE's international rivals in oligopolistic markets could try to gain market share by leveraging higher U.S. metals prices, while GE customers would likely balk if the company tried to re-price its order backlog higher. GE has $134 billion in backlogs tied to its power, oil and gas, and renewable energy segments, according to its 2017 10-k report.Inch also warned that the rail business GE seeks to sell or spin off could become less attractive to potential buyers as metal input costs rise. That's particularly so ""given already tough competition from the Chinese (e.g., CRRC) and cyclically depressed U.S. loco market demand,"" Inch said.GE is targeting $20 billion worth of asset sales, including the transportation unit that makes locomotives, as it looks to improve cash flow and shrink its portfolio of businesses.Shares of GE fell 0.9% to 14.51 on the stock market today, slashing losses as the White House said Trump tariffs may exempt Canada and Mexico. Inch has a price target of 13 on GE stock and a sell rating, but the stock is still hanging on to a weekly gain after a longtime GE analyst said Monday he saw material upside potential over the near and medium term.Dow Jones peers United Technologies (UTX) and 3M (MMM) fell 0.5% and rose 0.85%, respectively. Honeywell (HON) gained 0.7% and Siemens (SIEGY) added 0.4%.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

The industrial giant also raised its full-year adjusted EPS and sales forecast.Lockheed Martin (LMT) topped first-quarter estimates and the defense contractor raised EPS and revenue targets. But the F-35 maker didn't raise its cash-flow expectation. Northrop Grumman (NOC) also reported Q1 earnings above estimates, but Northrop said it didn't submit a bid for the Air Force's GPS III contract, leaving Lockheed as the likely lone bidder. Raytheon (RTN) raised its full-year earnings forecast above consensus as its Q1 earnings and revenue topped estimates. General Dynamics (GD) beat on earnings and met revenue views. Shares of all four defense contractors sold off sharply for the week.The software kingpin earned 95 cents a share, up 36% year over year, on sales of $26.8 billion, up 16%, in its fiscal third quarter. Analysts expected 85 cents and $25.71 billion. Microsoft (MSFT) has been shifting its business from desktop PC software to cloud-computing infrastructure and applications, such as Office 365 and Azure. Microsoft's commercial cloud revenue rose 58% in fiscal Q3. The software giant initially reclaimed a recent buy point on Friday, but pared gains.Intel (INTC) earnings rose 32% as sales grew 9% to $16.1 billion, both well above analyst views. The chip giant guided higher for current quarter sales, indicating a third-straight quarter of top-line growth. Shares initially jumped to a 17-year high Friday but reversed to close slightly lower. Texas Instruments (TXN), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), STMicroelectronics (STM) and Xilinx (XLNX) got boosts from upbeat earnings reports. But chip-gear maker Teradyne (TER) tumbled after warning of weak demand for equipment to test mobile devices. Western Digital (WDC), which makes disk drives and memory chips, tumbled Friday despite beating fiscal Q3 views. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fought for support at its 200-day moving average.Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) reported Q1 earnings and revenue that topped views but a sharp rise in capital spending, margin pressure and higher traffic acquisition costs sparked a sell-off in the internet search giant. Capex jumped to $7.3 billion from $2.5 billion in the year-ago period, including $2.4 billion for a real estate purchase in Manhattan. Traffic costs — or what Google pays partner websites to generate advertising revenue — jumped 36% to $6.288 billion.

Ford will not invest in traditional sedans for North America going forward, and will almost phase out passenger cars by 2020, as consumers migrate to SUVs and light trucks. GM still sees small cars as an opportunity at home and abroad, even as it too shifts focus to larger and more profitable vehicles.Casino operator Las Vegas Sands (LVS) topped first-quarter results estimates, helped by strong demand in global gaming hub Macau and in Singapore. Macau also helped Q1 results for Wynn Resorts (WYNN), but its overall and Macau sales disappointed some analysts. Wynn Resorts also approved a dividend increase. The earnings report from Wynn was the first since Steve Wynn resigned as CEO and sold his stake following allegations of sexual misconduct. MGM Resorts (MGM) narrowly beat, but the stock tumbled on declining traffic at its U.S. locations. MGM is more U.S.-focused than Sands or Wynn.Amgen (AMGN) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) broadly topped Q1 views, though Amgen's sales and adjusted profit outlook for 2018 were a bit soft at the midpoints.

Total student enrollments rose 7.7% year over year to about 861,400. IBD 50 stock TAL Education's (TAL) EPS jumped to 14 cents a share as revenue soared 59% to $504 million.

Homebuilder stocks were generally muted due to rising interest rates. But D.R. Horton (DHI), the biggest U.S. builder, on Thursday bested views with a 52% EPS surge as revenue swelled 17% to $3.795 billion. Homebuilder stocks rallied for solid gains, helped by cooling Treasury yields. New-home sales rose in March to an annualized sales pace of 694,000 units, a four-month high. Meanwhile existing-home prices rose 6.8% in February vs. a year earlier.China search-engine leader Baidu (BIDU) reported a Q1 profit that blew past estimates, lifting shares. Baidu still owns a majority of iQiyi (IQ), which held its IPO in March. Video streaming website iQiyi accounts for roughly 20% of the parent's revenue. Shares in iQiyi fell after it released earnings in tandem with Baidu.Visa (V) reported a 29% EPS gain on a 13% revenue rise, both beating fiscal Q2 views. The credit- and debit-card giant raised its full-year revenue outlook. Shares leapt 4.8% on Thursday.3M (MMM) met EPS views as revenue rose 8% to $8.278 billion, just above consensus. But the Dow Jones giant slashed its full-year EPS target. 3M stock plunged.Caterpillar (CAT) reported strong Q1 earnings and sales, but shares of the heavy construction and equipment maker reversed sharply lower Tuesday after warning that operating margins hit a ""high watermark"" for the year.ServiceNow (NOW) reported Q1 profit and revenue above estimates.

Shares fell 5.2% Friday. In Q1, advanced protection solutions nearly doubled to make up 20% of new and add-on bookings, up from 15% in the prior quarter.

53,UTX,"General Electric (GE) helped pace outperformance by blue chip stocks as the Dow Jones industrial average gained more than 1% at one point, but then cut the gains to around 0.6% in late-afternoon trading on Thursday.X GE, up 1.1%, does not have the same impact on the Dow as it once did. At 14.70, even a future 1 point rally, equivalent to a gain of more than 6%, would not significantly hoist the Dow industrial higher by much.The Nasdaq composite lagged, losing early gains to fall 0.1%, as names such as digital TV hardware play Roku (ROKU), LendingTree (TREE) and waste control products play Stericycle (SRCL) all fell sharply, weighing on the tech-centered index.The S&P 500 was up 0.1%. At 2731, the large-cap gauge is trying to rally back above its 50-day moving average after a follow-through took place on Feb. 14. A follow-through is a bullish signal that confirms a new tradable market rally could be underway.The Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) exchange-traded fund slumped nearly 0.7% lower. At 33, the collection of top-flight growth stocks is trading fractionally lower since Jan. 1. FFTY gained 37% in 2017.Winners led losers on the NYSE at one point by a comfortable 9-5 margin. On the Nasdaq, rising stocks virtually matched falling ones in number. But the Nasdaq is still the market leader since Jan. 1, up nearly 4.8% while the Dow industrials trail with a gain of less than 0.5%.At least six of the 30 components in the price-weighted Dow Jones industrials rose 2 points or more, including United Technologies (UTX). The industrial and manufacturing play burst back above the 10-week moving average near 132 in bullish fashion as shares rose more than 3% to 133.47 in volume running more than 50% above its 50-day average.United Tech, which makes aircraft engines, elevators and security systems, has been showing steady single-digit top and bottom line growth in most of the past seven quarters. But in 2018 and 2019, the Street expects earnings to accelerate, rising 6% to $7.05 a share this year and up 11% the next.United has risen 8% since rallying out of a five-month cup with handle at 123.38 in mid-December. At one point, before the intermediate-level correction flattened the market, United was up as much as 12.8%.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportReturning to GE, one of the positive developments for the former market leader is the fact that Wall Street is encouraged by major reform plans by the new CEO John Flannery. Proof? The 2019 consensus earnings estimate has been revised higher, now seen at $1.06 a share, up 10% vs. an expected profit of 96 cents this year.This means GE is trading less than 14 times expected 2018 earnings; the Boston-based company recently slashed is quarterly cash dividend by half.  So with a 12-cent dividend per share, the annualized yield comes out to 3.3%, which hardly puts a dent into capital losses caused by the stock's 16.6% slide year to date.The S&P 500 trades roughly 20 times trailing 12-month earnings and shows an annualized dividend yield of 1.8%. (You can track the yield of the S&P 500 at the top of the General Market Indicators page, a PDF link at the bottom of the daily IBD Big Picture column.)The challenge, however, for GE, will be to find new avenues to boost the top line. Healthy sales, delivered by innovative new products and new markets, are the mother of strong earnings.GE is certainly in danger of falling out of the Dow due to its sharply hammered stock price. The stock is more than 52% below its 52-week high and trading well below the 50- and 200-day moving averages, a clear sign of weakness.Former Dow Jones industrial stocks such as Alcoa (AA), which has been split into two public companies including Arconic (ARNC), suffered such a fate in late 2013.At the time, the aluminum giant traded well below 10 a share. Computer and printer titan HP Inc. (HPQ), formerly Hewlett-Packard, and Bank of America (BAC) also departed the blue-chip Dow due to miserable stock performance.On IBD Stock Checkup,Elsewhere, the Dow Jones utility average rebounded 0.9%. But at 671, the interest rate-sensitive index is still down 7.3% since Jan. 1.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond eased to 2.92%, signifying some bargain-hunting among fund managers, even as the U.S. dollar fell against both the euro and the yen. West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices rallied 1.6% to $62.66 a barrel.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on breakouts, top stocks, major indexes and financial markets.)RELATED:Where Is The Stock Market Headed?

Some cyclical groups such as construction and mining machinery also tumbled.Stocks also have weakened on worries that rising inflation may cause the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster than planned.

56,UTX,"Is United Technologies (UTX) a more valuable property together or is UTC better off in three separate businesses? That's the question for one of the largest U.S. industrial conglomerates — and an answer should be coming soon, its chief executive said Wednesday.X United Tech's $23 billion megadeal for Rockwell Collins (COL) last year was seen as prelude to a potential breakup of the industrial giant years down the road. As investors digested that hefty price, some hoped that CEO Greg Hayes would separate the aerospace-focused units from the parts of the company that make Carrier air conditioners and Otis elevators.On Wednesday morning, Hayes signaled he's open to all possibilities for United Tech's disparate businesses as a result of a ""great benefit"" from the recently enacted tax reform.""By end of year, we will come back and have some answers in terms of what we really think we should do with the portfolio long term,"" he told the audience at the Barclays Industrials Select Conference in Miami, Florida.""The real question is do you get significant multiple expansion by having separate companies vs. the conglomerate (structure),"" he added, describing aerospace as a $45 billion-$50 billion business that enjoys significant scale, elevators as a $12 billion-$13 billion business and climate-control systems as a $17 billion-$18 billion business.Hayes expects the Rockwell Collins acquisition to close by June or July and add to earnings next year.Under the Trump corporate-tax cuts, United Tech will be able to pay down the Rockwell debt much more quickly than it had anticipated even six months ago, giving it options around the portfolio, he explained. The company has $8 billion in cash overseas and expects to repatriate about $3.5 billion this year, about $2.5 billion more than it had expected.Shares of Connecticut-based United Technologies punched up rallied 2.2% to 129.26 on the stock market today. The Dow Jones component sits 7% below the late January high of 139.24, but found resistance at the 50-day line Wednesday. It has gained 13% over the past year vs. a 20% gain for the Dow Jones industrial average as a whole.Dow peer General Electric (GE), which is mulling a breakup of its own, retreated 1.7% Wednesday. GE shares have lost more than half their value over the past year, with the company mulling a sale of its industrial gas engines business and selling an overseas part of its iconic lighting unit as it tries to remedy a sharp decline in profits. 3M (MMM) fell 1.1% to 232.18.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersThe breakup question for many U.S. multi-industry companies comes as some investors have grown disenchanted with the conglomerate structure.In part, the disenchantment stems from concerns that hoped-for synergies among component businesses have failed to materialize.In September, Hayes had described talk of a corporate breakup as premature, telling The New York Times that United Technologies will need the revenue from all of the combined operations' businesses to pay down debt tied to the Rockwell Collins deal.Hayes pointed out Wednesday that the various businesses within conglomerates benefit from shared back-office services such as payroll and centralized tax systems.""There are, as you can imagine, significant dissynergies with splitting up the portfolio as well as one-time costs,"" he added.Hayes also affirmed at the Miami event that United Tech has resumed production on the geared turbofan engine and expects to ""have wrung out most of the teething issues"" by end of year.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:If General Electric Breaks Up, Should You Break Up With GE's Stock?2018 Stock Market Forecasts: Read The Predictions For Top Stocks And IndustriesHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

Ring's smart doorbell streams audio and visuals to smartphones, for example.Johnson Controls' security products business, Honeywell's home product portfolio and United Technologies' (UTX) safety and security unit likely face the most near-term risk, he added.Honeywell said in October it's planning to spin off two divisions including Homes by the end of 2018. Sprague said Homes could become an Amazon target.""The announcement that Amazon is acquiring the doorbell video security company Ring probably does not help the sentiment for companies competing in the increasingly contested smart home security market,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray wrote after Honeywell's investor event.

But the malfunction led European air safety officials to issue emergency restrictions on Feb. 9 after ""several occurrences"" of reported in-flight engine shutdown and aborted takeoffs.A day later, Airbus stopped accepting affected Pratt & Whitney engines for its A320neo family aircraft, according to reports. According to Airbus, 113 Pratt & Whitney-powered A320neo family aircraft are in use with 18 customers.On Feb. 12, Pratt & Whitney offered more details, saying the geared turbofan problem arose from engineering changes made in mid-2017 to improve the durability of the knife-edge seal for the geared turbofan. ""In late January and early February of this year, four of these modified engines did not perform as anticipated,"" it said, adding 43 engines installed on 32 aircraft are affected. Of them, 21 aircraft have one engine with the modified configuration, and 11 aircraft have two engines with that configuration.Roughly 55 such engines delivered to the Airbus final assembly line await installation on customer aircraft.United Tech invested roughly $15 billion in its next-gen geared turbofan, allowing different engine components to run at different speeds, improving fuel efficiency while producing less noise and exhaust.The issue adds to a string of problems dogging the geared turbofan engine. Production issues delayed the A320neo's planned entry into service in 2015 and have tested the patience of customers like Airbus and Qatar Airways.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:If General Electric Breaks Up, Should You Break Up With GE's Stock?2018 Stock Market Forecasts: Read The Predictions For Top Stocks And IndustriesHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

72,UTX,"General Electric (GE) shares turned lower Monday afternoon as a widely followed Wall Street analyst turned more bearish on the stock.X Steve Tusa of JPMorgan said that he sees ""an expedited evolution of outcomes at GE"" given continued underperformance, challenging fundamentals, revelations about the cash hole in its financial  business, and lack of signs of a turnaround.Tusa noted recent management comments on evaluating the conglomerate's vast portfolio of businesses. But he sees ""more urgency in the situation"" given the recent moves in GE bonds and, he added, a growing realization that, even if cash improves, the balance sheet does not offer many options for future growth.""In other words, it's either a steady grind in uncertain markets, with risk that things get more extreme in more volatile capital markets, or it's a change in structure to try and de-risk, and simplify the portfolio to grow it in a more focused way in the future, and we see a bit of a mix,"" Tusa wrote in a Feb. 12 note to clients.A low-growth portfolio ""with weak free cash flow and too much leverage"" raises the question of whether an equity raise is possible, Tusa added. He maintained an underweight rating on GE stock and lowered his price target from 16 to 14.Shares of GE fell 0.8% to 14.83 on the stock market today, pulling back from an earlier high of 15.14.

For more analysis on GE, visit IBD Stock Checkup.Tusa does not believe GE needs to raise equity from a liquidity or survival perspective. However, such a move would lower leverage, providing safety and optionality, though it could also raise the dividend burden and make a cut more likely, he added.In January, GE countered the idea of a potential equity raise by saying that it has no plans to raise new capital and has already taken steps to shore up its cash position. The company slashed its 24-cent quarterly dividend payout in half  last November.GE rallied at the start of 2018 after a dismal 2017, but the stock resumed its downtrend after the company spoke of an SEC probe and portfolio changes.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:If General Electric Breaks Up, Should You Break Up With GE's Stock?Don't Panic, It's Just A Correction: Here's What You Do NowWhen To Sell Stocks — Rules That Help You Protect Profits And Avoid LossesIs It Time To Get Into — Or Out Of — The Stock Market?How To Spot A Major Stock Market Top, The Easy Way

Woodward builds those parts along with engine parts, pumps and valves for commercial and defense aircraft.Talk of a deal comes as Boeing looks to ramp up its new parts and services business, which the company hopes will more than triple its annual revenue to $50 billion in five years.Other aerospace suppliers are bulking up.

77,UTX,"A longtime Wall Street analyst who has watched his bull case for General Electric (GE) unravel fessed up to being wrong on GE stock in a note to clients Monday.""The bears won. The game is over,"" wrote Melius Research's Scott Davis, who has researched industrial equities for 25 years, including prior stints at Barclays and Morgan Stanley.Davis expressed embarrassment at ""being associated as a bull in the worst-performing stock of the year.""Nonetheless, he reaffirmed a buy rating on GE stock and a price target of 27, arguing that a breakup of the iconic company would boost valuations.Shares rose 1.4% to 14.27 on the stock market today, They have been straddling the 50-day moving average since the industrial giant's earnings and revenue beat in April.

Honeywell (HON) rose 7 cents to 144.23. Siemens (SIEGY) climbed 0.4%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHere are the lessons Davis learned from the mistake that he now owns up to:While GE management ""explained away"" degrading contract terms with customers, cash flow was a red flag, Davis said. Margins on industrial free cash flow went from 7.1% in 2015 to 4.8% in 2017.""When down payments decrease, final payments don't match up with product delivery, and receivables grow faster than revenue, there is usually a problem,"" Davis added.Although he sees early signs of improvement in GE's cash flows, a fix for the ""deep"" hole the industrial giant is in will take time.Warning signals included a disproportionate rise in risk tolerance and M&A deals outside GE's historical scope to questionable compensation packages and a dismissive attitude toward those who questioned the company, Davis said.He believes the creation at GE of ""smaller, more focused entities that can build their own cultures"" may repair the problem.The conglomerate's 18-member board under former CEO Jeff Immelt lacked experience in many of the areas where the conglomerate was making a big push — such as software and emerging markets, Davis said. Many also lacked expertise in core GE segments such as power generation, aviation and health care, he added.Now Davis is of the view that ""an unusually large number of board members"" is among the key signs of weak governance, along with lack of diversity and lack of talent in technology, especially software.The $143 million in fees for auditor KPMG can lead to potential conflict of interest and bad behavior, Davis said. It's now clear to him that ""the audit cost alone indicates a company that is way too complex"" — and the company's recent, delayed financial restatement has not allayed that fear. The late filing is another sign of complexity, he added.Davis had a turnaround thesis on GE last year, but later concluded that new CEO John Flannery had ""failed to see the depths of the company's problems and he had too much to fix for any one person to handle.""Davis noted that Flannery has been in charge almost a year now and ""we haven't seen much."" But he also noted that turnarounds that initially looked like they would take two years ended up taking three to five years at other companies.Davis admits his earnings model badly missed the ""the fast degradation in power markets and lack of recovery in oil/gas.""And he had recommended the stock ""while not fully understanding the risk in the insurance business"" and underestimating its complexity.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:GE Dividend Looks Safer On This Good News; Stock Tops Key LevelIf General Electric Breaks Up, Should You Break Up With GE's Stock?From Boeing To GE, Companies Eye Trump's Decision On Iran Nuclear Deal

81,UTX,"General Electric (GE) will report first-quarter results Friday as it continues to slog through a restructuring of its vast portfolio of businesses that spans everything from jet engines to medical scanners.XAnalysts on average expect a 48% decline in Q1 EPS to 11 cents despite a 1% revenue increase to $27.88 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.The world's largest industrial conglomerate faces one of the worst slumps in its 126-year history while the global economy booms.After it posted years of weak earnings, new CEO John Flannery took the helm in August, vowing he will make ""2018 a reset year"" built on massive cost cuts, billions in asset sales, and a new strategic vision. Despite some progress on those fronts, problems have continued to mount.Notably, GE lowered its 2018 profit outlook and disclosed an SEC probe of its accounting practices. Investors responded by dumping its stock afresh, which now sits at its worst level since 2009.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseShares closed up 2.4% at 13.99 on the stock market today. Fellow Dow Jones industrial average industrial conglomerates United Technologies (UTX) and 3M (MMM), finished 0.8% and 0.3% lower, respectively.Here are five key areas to watch:Aviation is in the spotlight, after a jet engine made by GE's joint venture with Snecma blew apart in midair Tuesday, forcing a Southwest Airlines (LUV) flight to make an emergency landing and killing one passenger.Last week's accounting restatement also raised some flags. The aviation unit is the ""crown jewel"" of GE's vast business portfolio, according to investment research firm Morningstar.However, restated profits in aviation were flat in 2017 vs. 2016, JPMorgan analyst Steve Tusa said earlier this week. Cowen analyst Gautam Khanna chimed in that ""aviation profits were flattish"" despite a much more favorable backdrop in 2017 than it can expect in 2018.Higher oil prices will weigh on the unit, he said. Plus, deliveries of the advanced but loss-making LEAP jet engines are expected to ramp up.GE Power will also be in focus after Flannery's promise to ""reset, refocus, and renew"" the deeply troubled flagship unit. Power's earnings crumbled 45% in 2017. GE has warned that the gas-turbine market was ""far more challenging"" than it foresaw in 2017 and that the pain could persist into 2019.Management's 2018 outlook is unrealistic and will likely have to be lowered, analysts caution.Goldman Sachs' Joe Ritchie warned Monday that a cut to GE's $1.00-$1.07 EPS guidance for 2018 is ""almost a certainty"" after the restatements. He thinks it could happen during the Q1 earnings report.Cowen's Khanna is less certain that the compnay will cut its guidance this quarter, but warns it will ""capitulate"" sometime this year.Analysts on average expect full-year 2018 EPS of 96 cents, following a lowering of estimates in the past four weeks, according to Zacks Investment Research.The continued deterioration in GE Power is a big reason why analysts think the company will have to walk back its numbers.Cash is top of mind for Flannery — and investors in General Electric.For 2018, GE is targeting $6 billion to $7 billion in free cash flow. It needs $4.2 billion just to support its newly reduced dividend. Any cut to cash flow guidance will be another blow to investors who had long prized it as one of the best income stocks.Amid cash flow challenges, the company halved its annual dividend in November to 48 cents.""The dividend may be trimmed again,"" Khanna cautioned Thursday, reiterating a view shared earlier by both Cowen and JPMorgan. A slumping GE stock has raised the dividend yield to 3.5%.Contract assets grew $3.7 billion in 2017 to $28.86 billion. It's an area of concern, not only because those assets have swelled in recent years but also because its contract accounting is now drawing regulatory scrutiny.Contract assets reflect revenues that the company books on long-term equipment and service contracts before it gets the cash in hand.GE may address plans to convert its contract assets to cash in its call with analysts Friday, following the earnings release. In 2017, cash flows from contract assets were below GE's own expectations.Besides contract assets, management will also likely be pressed on plans to dispose of $20 billion in assets.So far, its deals have been relatively small fry, including a sale of its industrial solutions business for $2.6 billion and the sale of a health care technology unit for $1 billion. Proceeds from asset sales will help support the dividend.As GE mulls smaller asset sales, it has kept the option of a bigger breakup in play, with the core aviation, power and health units becoming separately traded assets.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:If General Electric Breaks Up, Should You Break Up With GE's Stock?GE's Factory-In-A-Box Will Help It Expand This Key Business As Power WiltsGE Engine In Spotlight As Southwest, NTSB Probe Fatal FlightIs There A Way To Make A Million Dollars By Trading ETFs?

But existing large-scale factories are not ideal for drug manufacturers looking to produce small batches of therapies, he added.Additionally, the KUBio factories can help drug makers to lower costs.Many advanced drug candidates for treating Ebola — the deadly West African outbreak —also use viral vector technology. The factory-in-a-box solution can address challenges tied to producing vaccines, which are critical to people around the world but generate low revenue for their manufacturers, the company says.GE looks to grow in the gene therapy business as it battles a severe downturn in its gas-turbine and power-plant business.  The power unit is likely to show a hit when first-quarter results come out Friday.Gene therapy is a risky but promising technique that may one day  allow doctors to treat disorders without conventional drugs or surgery, according to the National Institutes of Health.

"
109,UTX,"General Electric's (GE) attempts at an image makeover with a slew of cost-cutting measures and executive reshufflings may be signs that things are about to get worse instead of better at the industrial giant.XOn Monday, GE announced that Ed Garden, founding partner of Trian Fund Management, will join its board. Trian has pressured GE to cut its $2.4 billion in corporate costs and revive its slumping stock price. The move followed several C-suite changes at GE on Friday, including the departure of CFO Jeff Bornstein.Analysts at JPMorgan, however, slammed the leadership moves, saying they suggest ""core fundamental challenges are worse than consensus is currently discounting,"" while also reaffirming an underweight on GE stock.""Not only is the baseline of the now hotly debated 'reset' likely lower, but what we think investors are ignoring is the trend line on the businesses, some of which have secular issues (i.e. implications for multiple), a hole that is unlikely to be dug out of with simple cost cuts alone,"" JPMorgan's Stephen Tusa and his team wrote in a Monday note.Tusa was referring to expectations that new GE CEO John Flannery will offer an updated 2018 outlook next month. GE already has signaled that a current EPS goal of $2 for 2018 may be too high.Also, Vertical Research Partners analyst Jeff Sprague said Friday that the CFO change is ""especially troubling"" because Bornstein had been seen as Flannery's partner in his turnaround plan.Shares of GE dived 3.2% to 23.62 on the stock market today. Among industrial peers, 3M (MMM) edged up 0.1% to 216.64, just above a 214.67 buy point. United Technologies (UTX) rose 0.3% to 118.68 as it forms a flat base with a 124.89 entry point and an alternative entry of 120.29. 3M and United Technologies as Dow components, like GE.Honeywell (HON) dipped 0.1% to 143.54 after initially rising to a record 145.30 on reports that it's planning to spin off noncore assets into at least two public companies. Honeywell is in buy range from a 140.31 entry.IBD'S TAKE: Earnings season is about to kick off. Here's a list of Dow stocks near buy points to watch ahead of third-quarter results.On Friday, GE said Jamie Miller, who heads GE's transportation business, will assume the CFO role on Nov. 1. Bornstein exits at the end of the year, with two other GE vice chairs and longtime veterans.JPMorgan's Tusa questioned the ""rationale for a seemingly heavy focus on internal candidates"" in selecting a new CFO and added that the likelihood of a dividend cut ""moves materially higher.""Vertical Research Partners analyst Jeff Sprague also said Friday that a dividend cut is now more likely.""The dividend consumes all or most of GE's industrial FCF (free cash flow) for the foreseeable future,"" Sprague added. ""A dividend cut could crush the stock as retail investors flee, but maintaining it gives GE little or no excess cash to grow the company. ""And now that activist investor Trian is getting a board seat, RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray says its engagement in shaping GE policy will intensify.""We expect Trian to promote value-adding moves like transitioning closer to GAAP EPS reporting, further boosting structural cost-out, and rationalizing the portfolio,"" he said in a Monday note, adding that the move highlighted that Flannery ""clearly wanted to avoid a messy proxy fight with Trian's Nelson Peltz.""Trian's $2.5 billion bet on GE in October 2015 is now worth about $1.7 billion, with Trian trimming its GE holdings by more than 20% as the stock has underperformed over the past year, Dray noted.RELATED:These 5 Dow Stocks Are Near Buy Zones As Earnings Season BeginsHoneywell's Expected Spinoffs Fall Short Of Investor's PlanDow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And AnalysisGE Shakes Up Top Execs While More Perks Fall To Cost-Cutting Drive

110,UTX,"Large and megacap stocks mostly continued to hold firm amid another whirlwind day of quarterly results. Tesla (TSLA) led the downside among companies reporting as the innovative electric vehicle maker likely posted its biggest quarterly net loss on a per-share basis since it came public in June 2010.XTesla gapped down at the open and slid more than 7% to 297.85. Volume is running nearly four times the usual pace; the big cap trades on average 5.42 million shares each day.Meanwhile, all eyes are on Apple (AAPL) as it reports fiscal fourth-quarter results after the close.The stock is behaving well since clearing a new buy point in a decent cup with handle. The classic chart pattern shows a 160.87 buy point. Apple's cup with handle formed next to a flat base created from May to July. The buy point from that base was 156.75, and Apple, currently at 168.43, has lifted 7% above that correct entry. It is less than 5% from the 160.87 entry.The Dow Jones industrial average rallied 0.4%, despite a nearly 2% sell-off in Home Depot (HD). The stock is getting buying support, however, at the 50-day moving average. Home improvement chains fell on reports that President Trump and the GOP are mulling the idea of reducing the mortgage interest deduction from taxes.Eight of the 30 Dow Jones industrial average components rose 1 point or more, including industrial plays 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX) as well as consumer spending bellwethers such as McDonald's (MCD).At 3:45pm ET, the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 edged slightly up. The Russell 2000 rose nearly 0.3%.Going back to Tesla, the stock posted a critical sell signal when it fell 7% below a recent breakout past a 370.10 entry in a cup with handle of its own. That base began forming when Tesla peaked at 386.99 on June 23.While that base had a normal-sized decline of 22% from head to toe, one problem with the base was that it revealed numerous sharp declines, including gap downs, in heavy or increasing volume. That's a no-no; you'd prefer a stock to show quiet, smooth price action on a day to day and week to week basis.Those who bought at Tesla's breakout in the spring of 2013 near 50 still hold a very large profit cushion and can afford to hold patiently. The stock is 23% off its 52-week peak of 389.61, and that is not severe.However, two more reasons for newer shareholders to sell include the following:One, the stock is now on the verge of forming a deeper, longer base. It's going to take a while before Tesla will set up again. Keeping shares means that you lose the opportunity to invest in a stock that currently shows more horsepower.Two, Tesla failed to deliver on its promise to rapidly ramp up production and deliveries of its Model 3, its most affordable e-vehicle yet. Now, the company must deliberately slow down production in its highly successful Model S to meet already huge demand for the Model 3. Continued failure to manage institutional investors' expectations and beat them may result in heavier selling among fund managers.Tesla's third-quarter revenue rose 30% to $2.98 billion, which is a quarterly record. However, that gain also represents a deceleration in the top-line growth rate. Sales grew 27%, 22%, 33%, 145%, 88%, 135% and 120% vs. year-ago levels in the prior seven quarters.Elsewhere, Sony (SNE) jacked up more than 3% to 44.91 in heavy turnover, extending its breakout out of a three-month flat base with a 41.75 entry. The base also has elements of a double bottom. From that perspective, the buy point was 40.59, 10 cents above the middle peak within the shallow base.Despite the breakaway gap on Tuesday, one could try to buy as close as possible to that session's opening price of 43.21 because that price was within the proper buy range, up to 5% past the 41.75 flat-base entry.Sony, one of Japan's most famous manufacturers and innovator in the video game space, reported a huge increase in adjusted Q3 profit (90 cents a share vs. 4 cents a year ago) as revenue climbed 10% to $18.3 billion, the biggest year-over-year increase in at least four years.Sony has helped Japan's Nikkei 225 enjoy strong gains in 2017. The Japanese equities benchmark finished 0.5% to 22,539 overnight, extending its year-to-date gain to 17.9%.At 2579, the S&P 500 is up 15.2% since Jan. 1.Returning to Apple, watch to see if the company can not only post another quarter of respectable double-digit earnings growth but also give hints as to whether business can accelerate during the holiday quarter and beyond.Earnings had dropped 10% in the fiscal year ended in September 2016, on an 8% slump in revenue. However, Apple has been staging a classic turnaround in fundamentals lately.In the past three quarters, the iMac maker's earnings rose 2%, 11% and 18% vs. year-ago levels, following a three-quarter slump. And in Q4 (ended in September), earnings are seen increasing 12% to $1.87 a share, which would mark a third quarter in a row of mild double-digit gains. It's slated to report Q4 results on Nov. 2 after the market close.For fiscal year 2019, the Street sees earnings accelerating 24% to $11.16 a share.Another positive for Apple shareholders: a respectable annualized dividend yield of 1.5%, with plenty of potential for  further increases in that cash payout. Apple tends to raise its dividend in the spring. But William O'Neil + Co. calculates that the company has a long-term annual dividend growth rate of 24% in recent years.Apple, featured in Stock Market Today columns frequently as it formed a bottoming base in the last quarter of 2016, has risen more than 43% since breaking out of a first-stage cup with handle on Jan. 6-9 at 118.12.In other financial markets, traders bought U.S. government bonds, pushing yields a touch lower following news that the Bank of England raised interest rates for the first time in a decade. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond is at 2.35%. President Trump, meanwhile, formally announced he's picked Jerome Powell to replace Janet Yellen as the head of the Federal Reserve.RELATED:Finding Superb Market Outperformers: Inside IBD 50Still The Golden Rule Of SellingWhat Does A Great Cup With Handle Look Like, And Why Does It Make Money For Traders?How To Invest: Use A Stock Checklist, Boost Your Portfolio ReturnHow To Find Excellent Stocks With Investors.com: Start Here

112,UTX,"Boeing (BA) announced Thursday it would buy Aurora Flight Sciences as the company looks toward more autonomous applications for aircraft, but the acquisition may hint at details about a new commercial plane being considered.XThe aerospace giant is considering building a new midmarket plane that analysts have dubbed the ""797."" If Boeing goes ahead with it, the plane will help the company compete against Airbus' (EADSY) A321neo, which has allowed airlines to open new routes that aren't accessible with smaller planes and aren't profitable with larger ones.Earlier this year, Boeing said it was looking at a ""hybrid"" cross-section that would cut the amount of cargo space, and the Aurora acquisition would provide some technical know-how on unconventional designs.Aurora has worked on innovative aircraft designs and along with United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney unit, helped build a so-called double bubble fuselage for NASA.The design features smaller wings that lower fuel consumption, and the engines are placed at the back of the fuselage to reduce the amount of thrust needed.When asked if Boeing would consider a design like this, Chief Technical Officer Greg Hyslop told reporters in a conference call Thursday that the company always evaluates future airframe ideas.While he declined to comment on the midmarket plane, he added that one design Boeing is looking at is a blended-wing body, which lacks any division between the wings and body of the plane.Boeing shares closed up 1.2% at 258.89 on the stock market today, near the high end of its buy range, which maxes out at 258.92. U.S.-listed shares of Airbus slipped 0.6%, and United Tech edged up 0.5%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? IBD's Leaderboard is showing a 60% increase over the S&P 500 so far this year.Terms of the Aurora deal weren't disclosed, but Boeing said it wouldn't impact its financial guidance.The companies aren't expecting pushback from the Defense Department or other regulators and hope the deal will close by the end of the year.Aurora has been a longtime partner with Boeing and the companies worked together on rapid prototyping for military and commercial applications.Other innovations Aurora could bring include advances in sensing technology, artificial intelligence and other areas around autonomous flight to ""make an already safe airplane even safer,"" Hyslop said.Aurora built a robotic co-pilot that has flown a Boeing 737 flight simulator. Boeing is considering more artificial intelligence applications to help with a pilot shortage.""The combined strength and innovation of our teams will advance the development of autonomy for our commercial and military systems,"" Hyslop said in a press release. ""Together, these talented teams will open new markets with transformational technologies.""One of those new markets could be air taxis that zip customers around crowded cities. In April, Aurora flew an air taxi prototype with vertical takeoff and landing technology and plans to deliver 50 to Uber Elevate, the ride-sharing company's flying car enterprise, by 2020.Aurora also is currently building a hybrid-electric plane for the Defense Department along with Honeywell (HON) and Rolls-Royce.Aurora has built 30 autonomous vehicles since it was founded in 1989 and is working on improving perception, machine learning and flight-control systems for its autonomous technology.RELATED: Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsWhy The Orbital ATK Buyout Is So Important For Northrop Grumman

113,UTX,"General Electric (GE) announced several executive changes late Friday, another in a raft of measures that it's taking to cut costs, restructure the portfolio and streamline operations.XJamie Miller, CEO of GE Transportation, takes over as chief financial officer Nov. 1, replacing Jeffrey Bornstein, who is also a vice chair at the industrials giant.Bornstein leaves GE Dec. 31 after 28 years of service. Two other vice chairs and longtime GE veterans, John Rice and Beth Comstock, depart at the same time.Under new CEO John Flannery, GE is showing it's serious about trimming $2 billion in costs by the end of 2018. Late Thursday, news emerged that is whisking away corporate cars on the heels of grounding its corporate jet fleet — perks that senior executives have enjoyed for decades.Top bosses at GE were informed via email that their leases on company cars will only be good through the end of 2018, CNBC reported Thursday evening. The move affects roughly 700 execs, and a GE spokeswoman confirmed the report.In September, the Dow component eliminated the use of GE-owned business jets for company executives to get to meetings around the globe. They will take charter and commercial flights instead.GE plans to eventually sell those aircraft, revealing last month that it had spent $258,000 on personal jet travel for former CEO Jeff Immelt in 2016, and another $75,000 on travel for other top executives.Shares of GE dipped 0.6% to 24.39 on the stock market today and are down 24% year to date. GE earns an IBD RS Rating of 11, meaning it has underperformed 89% of stocks over the past 12 months. Among other diversified industrial giants, Honeywell (HON) and Roper Technologies (ROP) inched up 0.4% Friday, and United Technologies (UTX), Siemens (SIEGY) and 3M (MMM) also clawed out fractional gains.IBD'S TAKE: Market-leading stocks usually boast an RS Rating of 80 or higher. This IBD screen helps you identify top growth stocks with superior price performance relative to the S&P 500.Flannery has promised an ""intense focus"" on operations and a review of the industrial conglomerate's vast portfolio of businesses, as investors worry about cash flow and margins. GE sold its industrial solutions unit in September and finalized the sale of GE Water this month.Also this month, Jeffrey Immelt retired as chairman about three months ahead of schedule and left the board. Flannery, who took over as CEO from Immelt in August, has replaced him as chairman.The industrial giant is also undergoing a restructuring at its corporate headquarters and in some other areas that could result in job cuts, according to news reports.RELATED:GE Is Cutting This Decades-Old Executive Perk To Save MoneyDow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And AnalysisImmelt Exits GE Ahead Of Plan As New CEO Adds Chairman Role

116,UTX,"Boeing (BA) could give an update on a possible midmarket plane and offer more reaction to Bombardier's (BDRBF) C Series deal with Airbus (EADSY) after the U.S. aerospace giant reports quarterly results Wednesday.XAnalysts expect earnings to fall 24.5% to $2.65 per share but revenue is seen rising 0.7% to $24.06 billion after four straight declines. Earlier this month, Boeing said Q3 commercial jet deliveries rose 7.4% to 202, which included 145 narrow-body 737s and 35 widebody 787 Dreamliners.Shares rose 1.4% to 266.00 on the stock market today, hitting a new all-time high.Boeing will likely talk about a potential new plane that analysts have dubbed the ""797."" While the company has yet to confirm if it will pursue the new aircraft, there are some clues to how the airplane might shape up.  Boeing bought Aurora Flight Sciences during the quarter. The company worked on innovative aircraft designs and along with United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney unit, helped build a so-called double bubble fuselage for NASA.Meanwhile, Airbus' acquisition of a majority stake in Bombardier's C Series jet could force Boeing to make a quicker decision on a future program. ""The C Series has potential to expand into a next-generation plane,"" Jeff Windau, senior equity analyst at Edward Jones, said in a prior interview with IBD. ""So you could see C Series move up and Airbus try to push down and right now Boeing doesn't have that middle of the market option.""The Bombardier- Airbus deal comes after the U.S. Commerce Department recently recommended a 300% tariff be imposed on each Bombardier C Series jet delivered to the U.S. Boeing has accused the Canadian company of receiving $3 billion in government subsidies, giving it an unfair competitive advantage.While the ruling looked like a win for Boeing's commercial segment, its defense sales to key NATO allies could take a hit. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May spoke out against the tariff as 4,200 Bombardier jobs in Northern Ireland could be at risk over the decision.The U.K. has a Boeing P-8 maritime surveillance plane on order, along with a fleet of new Apache attack helicopters.Canadian officials also threatened to cancel a planned purchase of 18 Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets over the ruling.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Missile defense will also likely be a hot topic as tensions heat up with North Korea.The Defense Department reportedly asked Congress to shift $416 million into missile defense programs. The Pentagon  also wants to boost the number of ground-based interceptors in Fort Greely, Alaska, where Boeing's Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system is located, to 64 from 44 and add 20 missile silos.Boeing could address the status of its KC-46 tanker program for the Air Force. The company has booked more than $2 billion in charges as delays continue.At an Air Force Association breakfast last week, Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch, military deputy in Air Force acquisition, said there is more testing to be done but doesn't have a timeline yet on when that will be completed.RELATED: Hypersonic Weapons: The Biggest Warfighting Disrupter Since Stealth Is ComingDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

117,UTX,"Boeing's (BA) first-round victory in tariff dispute with Canada's Bombardier (BDRBF) could hit commercial jet sales in the U.K.XThe Commerce Department recommended late Tuesday that a 220% tariff be imposed on each Bombardier C Series jet delivered to the U.S. after Boeing accused the Canadian aerospace giant of receiving $3 billion in government subsidies, giving it an unfair competitive advantage.A second ruling is expected on Oct. 5 but the U.K. is already upset about the recommendation as 4,200 Bombardier jobs in Northern Ireland could be at risk over the decision.""What I would say in relation to Boeing is that of course we have a long-term partnership with Boeing in various aspects of government and this is not the sort of behavior we expect from a long-term partner and it undermines that partnership,"" Prime Minister Theresa May said at the Bank of England's 20-year independence anniversary event.May reportedly had personally asked for President Trump's help in ending the dispute.Earlier this week Defense Secretary Michael Fallon warned that, ""This is not the behavior we expect from Boeing and it could indeed jeopardize our future relationship with them.""The U.K. has a Boeing P-8 maritime surveillance plane on order, along with a fleet of new Apache attack helicopters.But Fallon told Reuters that Britain would not cancel those orders but would take a look at two other future contracts Boeing was likely to bid on.Boeing shares fell 0.4% to 254.27 on the stock market today. The stock broke out of a flat base on Sept. 15 with a 246.59 buy point. Bombardier's U.S. listed shares initially sold off but rallied 8.25% to after losing 8.8% on Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important. The chart action of these top stocks offers an answer.Canadian officials threatened to cancel a planned purchase of 18 Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet jets over the ruling.Bombardier also pointed out that the C Series supported 23,000 jobs in the U.S. and the jet's engine is made by United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney unit.RELATED: Boeing's Victory Over Bombardier Risks Losing Big Defense SalesDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsQatar Air Orders Boeing 747s On Quest To Become Largest Cargo Carrier

118,UTX,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow industrials rose slightly Tuesday morning after the major averages closed near session lows Monday.XThe top-rated Medical-Biomed/Biotech group fell again. Several leading biotech stocks tested key levels as Biogen (BIIB), Amgen (AMGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Celgene (CELG), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) are all on tap with earnings this week.S&P 500 futures rose 0.1% vs. fair value. Dow futures climbed 0.3%. Nasdaq 100 futures edged up a fraction.The Nasdaq composite led Monday's retreat, losing 0.6%, while the S&P 500 index fell 0.4% and Dow industrials 0.2%. The Medical-Biomed/Biotech group fell 1.1%, its ninth straight decline after hitting a 22-month high on Oct. 11. Even so, it's still rated No. 1 out of the 197 industries that IBD tracks.Biogen reported better-than-expected earnings Tuesday morning. Amgen and Vertex follow on Wednesday, while Celgene, Alexion and Gilead Sciences report Thursday.In addition to Biogen, a slew of big earnings report Tuesday, including McDonald's (MCD), United Technologies (UTX), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and General Motors (GM) before the open.Biogen earnings rose nearly 21% to $6.31 a share as sales climbed 4% to $3.08 billion. Analysts had expected EPS of $5.70 and revenue of $3.04 billion. Biogen is a leader in multiple sclerosis drugs and it has a new hit with Spinraza, the only spinal muscular atrophy drug on the market. But investors are also bullish on the prospects for aducanumab, which has indicated in early testing that it can reduce cognitive decline in early Alzheimer's patients.Biogen shares rose 1% before the market open on Tuesday. On Monday, the stock fell 2.8% to 328.55 in Monday's stock market trading, their third straight decline, and closed just above the 5% buy zone from a 312.50 entry initially cleared at the end of August.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Amgen, Vertex and Gilead Sciences fell below their 50-day moving averages on Monday. Amgen closed below an old 182.70 buy point for the first time since its Sept. 11 breakout. Amgen, Vertex and Gilead are in new flat bases.Vertex busted out in July on promising data on a new cystic fibrosis drug. Gilead Sciences is best known for its HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C drugs, but last week won FDA approval for its CAR-T drug to treat an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The drug, Yescarta, comes from Gilead's recent acquisition of Kite Pharma.Gilead earnings are expected to fall 24% to $2.08, as hepatitis C drug sales tumble. Amgen EPS is seen up 2% to $3.09. Vertex earnings are expected to go vertical, surging 131% to 37 cents.Celgene shares rose 0.9% on Monday, but that's after tumbling 10.8% on Friday. Celgene scrapped late-stage trials on a Crohn's disease treatment. Wall Street forecasts a 19% EPS gain to $1.88.Alexion retreated 2.75% on Monday, undercutting the low of its short flat base. Alexion dropped below its 50-day moving average on Friday.Alexion earnings are expected to rise 8% to $1.33.One popular way to avoid stock-specific risks in biotech is via ETFs.

119,UTX,"Boeing (BA) won the first round in its tariff dispute with Canada's Bombardier (BDRBF) but the decision could cost Boeing important military sales to key NATO allies.The Commerce Department recommended late Tuesday that a 220% tariff be imposed on each Bombardier's C Series jet delivered to the U.S. after Boeing accused the Canadian aerospace giant of receiving $3 billion in government subsidies, giving it an unfair competitive advantage.A second ruling is expected on Oct. 5 and could add to the total tariff, which is already higher than the 160% duty Boeing suggested.The subsidization of goods by foreign governments is something that the Trump Administration takes very seriously, and we will continue to evaluate and verify the accuracy of this preliminary determination,"" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in a statement.Boeing shares climbed 0.6% to 255.8 on the stock market today as the broader averages rallied. The stock broke out of a flat base on Sept. 15 with a 246.59 buy point. Bombardier shares, which trade over the counter in the U.S., fell 8.8%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.But this ""America First"" decision could hit sales of Boeing military hardware to the U.K. as 4,200 Bombardier jobs in Northern Ireland could be at risk over the decision.""This is not the behavior we expect from Boeing and it could indeed jeopardize our future relationship with them,"" British Defence Secretary Michael Fallon told reporters in Belfast, according to Reuters.British Prime Minister Theresa May said that she was ""bitterly disappointed"" by the ruling after she had personally asked for President Trump's help in the dispute, according to the report.The U.K. has a Boeing P-8 maritime surveillance plane on order, along with a fleet of new Apache attack helicopters.Canadian officials threatened to cancel a planned purchase of 18 Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet jets over the ruling.

120,UTX,"Apple (AAPL), one of the true tech forces in an outstanding 2017 for the Nasdaq composite, showed poor action Thursday, closing below the 50-day moving average.X The megacap tech's 1.8% drop to 171.11 came in above-average volume, the second straight heavy-volume decline.The Nasdaq, also hurt by some wild trading in the semiconductor sector, edged less than 0.1% lower but the Dow Jones industrial average, boosted chiefly by its industrial components such as United Technologies (UTX), 3M (MMM) and Caterpillar (CAT), rallied more than 0.5%.The S&P 500 added less than 0.1%. Deep declines in homebuilding, airline, chip equipment, RV, automaker and gold mining shares hurt the major U.S. indexes. The Dow transports sold off again, losing 1.6%. At 11,007, the sector index still holds a 3.7% gain since Jan. 1, but that now significantly trails a 7.3% year-to-date rise for the Nasdaq composite.At 2839, the S&P 500 boasts a 6.2% advance since Jan. 1 with four trading sessions left in January.The S&P SmallCap 600 led the day with a 0.4% lift. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq dropped from Wednesday's levels.Within the recreational vehicle industry group, Winnebago Industries (WGO) flashed a defense-type sell signal as shares dropped 4.35 points, or 8%, to 49.The leisure and transport stock play, a nice winner in 2017, slumped even further below the important 50-day moving average in volume that was 178% above the 50-day moving average.The 50-day moving average is an important tool for knowing when to sell and capture solid price gains in leading stocks. Drawn as a red line in IBD's daily charts, it traces the average closing price of a stock or an index over the past 50 trading sessions. Once a new trading day is completed, a new average close is computed and plotted on the chart; thus, the average is ""moving.""Healthy leading stocks hold above their 50-day moving averages. After a strong breakout, a mild pullback to or near the 50-day line (or the 10-week moving average on a weekly chart) for the first or second time offers a follow-on buy opportunity.Winnebago has rallied as much as 57% after breaking out of a long and deep cup with handle at 37.30 on Sept. 6 last year.Notice how Winnebago also gave an early sign of a potential change in character on Jan. 16 as the stock clipped its 50-day line in heavy volume. That was the first close below the mid-term support and resistance level since late August.Going back to Apple, watch to see how the largest company by market cap in the U.S. financial markets finishes for the week.For now, an 11.9% gain for the iPhone and digital services titan from an Oct. 27 breakout past a second-stage cup with handle at 160.97 has been whittled down to 6.2%.One of the key sell rules in IBD investing: Don't allow a 10% or more gain in a stock to turn into a complete round trip.Plus, the stock's relative strength line, painted in blue in all IBD and MarketSmith charts, has been diving over the past five sessions. That's a bad sign, because a falling RS line means a stock is underperforming the S&P 500.The action by Apple, certain chip plays such as Broadcom (AVGO) and other Apple component suppliers, also hints at institutional money rotating a little bit more out of tech and into cyclical and commodity-focused sectors.Broadcom, a humongous winner since the 2009 major market bottom, dropped nearly 4% to 247.25 in steep volume and undercut its long-term 200-day moving average. In doing so, the diversified semiconductor giant also did a round trip of gains following an Oct. 30 breakout past a 259.46 buy point in a nine-week flat base.Broadcom reportedly is a major chip component supplier to Apple.Those with outsize gains in Apple, however, have the luxury to be patient and check whether institutional investors see the recent sell-off as a brand new opportunity to buy shares and shore up the stock. As seen in a weekly chart, Apple is trading only 1% below the 10-week moving average, which moves similarly with the 50-day line on a daily chart.Apple began its impressive run back on Jan. 6, 2017, when it rallied out of a bottoming base pattern. Back then, it formed an excellent cup with handle that presented a proper buy point at 118.12.Since then, Apple's fundamentals have greatly improved, and the company has even posted mild double-digit growth (EPS up 11%, 18% and 24% in the past three quarters, revenue up 12% in fiscal Q4).However, as reported by IBD tech writers, some analysts are concerned about the sales figures of Apple's latest flagship, the iPhone X.For now, the fiscal Q1 EPS estimate has not changed as Wall Street consensus is for earnings to rise 13% to $3.80 a share.Elsewhere, chip equipment leader KLA Tencor (KLAC) dropped nearly 2% to 113.16 after being up as much as 5.9% intraday. The stock's uptrend is still intact, but continued negative reversals in heavy turnover would indicate that some institutions are heavily taking profits.On Dec. 18, KLA bolted past a 110.11 buy point in a base on base, but the ride has been volatile.As seen in IBD's stock research tables, which are ranked by performance among 33 distinct industry sectors, the Chips sector has fallen in the rankings after being in one of the top 3 spots for a long time in 2017. As of Jan. 24, Chips are now ranked No. 10.

But the fund still lies beneath its rising 50-day moving average. Shares are also still 52% below a 3,522 peak.Gold futures fell, sending the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) ETF down 0.8% to 127.93 in double normal turnover. Watch to see if the popular exchange-traded fund can climb back above a recent breakout point at 128.42.In crude oil markets, near-term WTI futures dipped nearly 0.6% to $65.24 a barrel.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary and analysis on financial markets, high growth stocks, and breakouts.)RELATED:Finding Great New IPOs: Who Are The Next Home Depot, Cisco, Yahoo And Google?The Renewed Case For A Bull Run In GoldInside The Big Picture: This Commodity Broke OutHow To Discover The Next Major Stock Market Top: Here Is The Easy WayKnow This Key Sell Signal For Growth StocksFinding The Best Growth Stocks: Follow A Simple Routine

121,UTX,"General Electric (GE) could be left out in the cold while other U.S. companies, including fellow industrial conglomerates, benefit from a tax windfall, according to an analyst.X The GOP tax package that President Trump signed into law Friday cuts the current corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. But Deutsche Bank says GE could end up a ""significant net loser"" because the plan also calls for a 15.5% repatriation rate on earnings held offshore as cash, and 8% if overseas profits are invested in nonliquid assets, such as plants and equipment. The repatriation tax would be mandatory.As a result, GE could end up owing up to $9 billion in new taxes, or an average of $1.1 billion for the next eight years, on $82 billion in foreign earnings reinvested abroad, according to Deutsche Bank analyst John Inch.""GE's substantial tax bill would come at a difficult time for the company given GE's ongoing cash squeeze from weak cash generation that recently forced the company to cut its dividend in half,"" Inch wrote Dec. 20.GE's quarterly dividend is now 12 cents a share, a 50% cut, allowing the company to save about $4 billion a year.Additionally, Inch noted, $4.5 billion of GE's overseas cash hoard, as of Sept. 30, was held in countries that may restrict or limit the return of funds.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point may have the wind at their backs.GE has long enjoyed an ultralow tax rate, the result of ""aggressive"" tax planning that leverages both GE's position as a multinational and GE Capital's ability to move funds around the world for tax advantages, the Deutsche Bank note added.This year, the firm forecasts GE Industrial's tax rate to be less than 5%. By comparison, GE's multi-industry peers on average pay rates from the mid- to high 20s.Companies had held off on paying income taxes on foreign earnings until those funds are returned, or repatriated, to the U.S. The 35% domestic rate has led several companies to stockpile profits abroad, leading to charges of tax avoidance.Several profitable U.S. companies paid an effective tax rate far less than 35% between 2008 and 2015, due to the tax loopholes and special breaks they enjoy, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.In fact, 18 companies, including GE, Priceline (PCLN) and PG&E (PCG), paid no federal income taxes at all over that eight-year period despite consistently churning out profits, it added.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksHere Are The Latest Stocks Joining The Bitcoin FrenzyTrump Tax Package Seen Boosting These Players In Info Tech

122,UTX,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) snubbed Boeing (BA) and picked its European rival Airbus (EADSY) for a massive midsize jet order in a deal announced Thursday.X The airline, which had been in talks with Boeing about buying around 100 of its 737 Max 10 jets, will instead buy 100 A321neos, worth $12.7 billion at list prices though airlines typically get steep discounts for major deals.Deliveries of the Airbus planes will begin in 2020, Delta said in a statement. The deal also includes a purchase of United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan engines.The Airbus order comes after a spat over narrow-body C Series passenger jets from Canada's Bombardier. Under pressure from Boeing, which claimed the C Series received unfair state aid, the U.S. levied a sky-high tariff on the plane, which Delta is buying. The carrier has since vowed not to pay the tariff.Boeing shares were up 0.7% to 293.88 on the stock market today. Airbus tumbled 4.1% as CEO Tom Enders could be ousted over corruption probes. Delta rose 3%, reclaiming a recent buy point as the carrier also raised unit revenue guidance. United Tech dipped 0.4%, still in buy range.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Losing the Delta deal could push Boeing to making a decision on whether to build a midmarket plane, which analysts have dubbed the 797, to compete against A321neo.The A321neo has taken significant market share from Boeing, as it has allowed airlines to open new routes that aren't accessible with smaller planes and aren't profitable with larger ones.Earlier this year, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg confirmed that the new plane could seat roughly 250 passengers and have a range of 5,000 nautical miles.Boeing has talked to United Airlines (UAL), Air Lease (AL) and other potential customers. At the Dubai Airshow last month, Boeing said it talked to state-run Saudi Arabian Airlines about a midmarket plane.RELATED: This Boeing Move Shows That It's Getting Serious About The '797' JetDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

126,UTX,"Honeywell (HON) set a conservative 2018 profit target Wednesday, but it was seen as part of a pattern of underpromising and overdelivering.X The industrial giant expects earnings of $7.55-$7.80 per share in 2018, with the midpoint 8 cents below the consensus view of $7.76, according to Zacks Investment Research. Management also see organic sales growth of 2%-4% in 2018.""Our take is that Honeywell typically sets a low bar for its outlook, building in some conservativeness and opportunity for beats during the course of the year,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray wrote in a Wednesday note. But one area of scrutiny, he added, would be ""aero's modest 1% to 3% organic sales growth target for 2018.""Honeywell also guided fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 EPS to the high end of its previous range, at $1.84 and $7.10 (excluding separation costs) respectively, matching consensus views.It also raised its outlook for Q4 sales growth to 9% from 5%-7%, better than the Zacks view for 5% growth, and full-year sales are now seen at $40.6 billion, up from a prior view of $40.2 billion-$40.4 billion, but still below consensus for $40.11 billion.Shares of Honeywell opened lower before popping 1.3% to 155.75 in early trade on the stock market today.

128,UTX,"The power division of General Electric (GE) will slash roughly 12,000 jobs globally as the industrial conglomerate looks to take out $3.5 billion in overall structural costs by 2018. One billion dollars is targeted to come from GE Power.X The core, but deeply troubled, GE unit has been hard hit by weak demand for gas turbines and coal-fire plants. Traditional power markets, including gas and coal, are challenged by ""overcapacity, lower utilization, fewer outages, an increase in steam plant retirements, and overall growth in renewables,"" GE said in a statement Thursday.Russell Stokes, CEO of GE Power, described the decision as a ""painful but necessary"" one that would help drive a turnaround in margins and cash flow for 2019 and beyond.But in the short term, Stokes expects market challenges to continue. ""Power will remain a work in progress in 2018,"" he said.Investors cheered news of the revamp, with shares of the Dow component gaining 0.3% to 17.71 on the stock market today.

GE plans to eventually pull back or exit from others including Baker Hughes (BHGE), the oilfield services business in which it holds a majority stake.Most of GE Power job cuts will be overseas.

132,UTX,"General Electric (GE) shares popped Friday as a government securities filing revealed that its leader loaded up on GE shares this week even as they hit nearly six-year lows.XGE Chairman and CEO John Flannery bought 60,000 GE shares at a stock price of $18.27 with his own money on Wednesday in a transaction worth roughly $1.1 million, CNBC reports.Investors reacted positively to the vote of confidence from the head of the troubled Boston-based industrial giant.Shares of GE rose 1.1% to 18.45 in morning trade on the stock market today.GE stock has fallen nearly 11% so far this week, undercutting its August 2015 ""flash crash"" low after Flannery on Monday revealed his turnaround strategy for this icon of American industry. The chief also slashed the profit outlook for 2018 and GE's beloved dividends.GE is down 42% year to date, making it the worst-performer on the Dow Jones industrial average. Dow peers 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX) are 29% and 8%, respectively, in the same period.IBD'S TAKE: Forget GE.

133,UTX,"Major stock indexes suffered modest losses Tuesday, but it was a constructive session as indexes closed near session highs.XThe Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.1% and the S&P 500 gave back 0.2%. The Dow's performance wasn't too bad considering that shares of General Electric (GE) lost 6% to 17.90. Shares are down close to 13% this week after the company on Monday outlined its turnaround plans and announced a 50% cut in the dividend to 12 cents a share.Weakness in GE was offset by strength in Dow components Coca-Cola (KO), United Technologies (UTX) and Home Depot (HD), which all ended with gains of more than 1%.Home Depot righted itself after a soft start, rising nearly 2% to 168.10 . It's been getting support at the 50-day moving average after a breakout from a base in early September. Profit, sales and same-store sales growth all topped expectations. Competitor Lowe's (LOW) reports next week.The Nasdaq composite and Russell 2000 small-cap index eased 0.3%. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in slightly higher than Monday.Apple (AAPL) lost 1.5% on reports that a growing number of iPhone X users have reported eye fatigue and headaches from using the new handset.Another notable mover Tuesday was iShares Nasdaq Biotech (IBB). It lost 1.6% to 305, breaking longer-term support at the 200-day moving average. At the other end of the extreme, Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) cleared a base with a 56 buy point, rising 1.3% to 56.88.Oil and gas groups lagged amid a 2% drop in benchmark crude oil. Prices were weak after the International Energy Agency cut its demand forecast for this year and next, citing warmer temperatures as well as rising production outside of OPEC. U.S. shale output, for example, has risen for 11 straight months.At the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude oil futures for December delivery settled at $55.70 a barrel, down nearly 2%.Other gainers included Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD). Shares of the restaurant chain soared 24% to 145.60 after private equity firm Roark Capital offered to buy the company for $2.3 billion, or 150 a share. CEO Sally Smith was dealt a setback in June when activist hedge Marcato Capital won a proxy fight that put three of its directors on Buffalo Wild Wings' board. Smith is stepping down as CEO at the end of the year.Group peer Wingstop (WING) added nearly 2% to 39.67. Volume has been heavy in the stock after a Nov. 3 breakout over a 36.01 buy point. The early-November surge was fueled by strong earnings that saw profit up 31% from  the year-ago quarter. Sales rose 19% to $26 million.Elsewhere, Cantel Medical (CMD) cleared a flat base with a 99.93 entry, but volume was light. Shares rose 1.5% to 100.61.

134,UTX,"General Electric (GE) CEO John Flannery isn't surprised by the plunge in GE stock over the past two days to its lowest point in nearly six years, but even GE bulls were surprised by the comeback strategy he unveiled Monday after more than 100 days at the helm — deeming it surprisingly bad, that is.XOn Tuesday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray yanked his outperform rating from General Electric. He said Flannery's turnaround plan fell short of a hoped-for sweeping reset and sees few reasons to believe the stock has bottomed at roughly 18.""There were very little new or bold ideas among the divestiture targets announced and no meaningful changes to the business model or quality of earnings,"" Dray wrote Tuesday. Instead, he said, Flannery's comments about missteps at the core GE Power segment and admission of systemic cash-flow shortfalls rattled the markets.Worse, GE executives said little about 2019 that inspired confidence in Dray about an eventual profit recovery. He slashed his price target on GE stock from 25 to 20, in light of ""deeper structural problems"" and a turnaround likely to be ""more protracted"" than previously thought.Meanwhile, Flannery told CNBC Tuesday he's unsurprised by GE stock's dive as disappointed investors bail, but insisted he can fix the broken industrial giant. Flannery on Monday vowed to slash both GE's vast portfolio of businesses and its beloved dividend to put GE back on the path to growth.IBD'S TAKE: Forget GE. These are some of the best income stocks for your watch list right now.But not all GE bulls are giving up. Melius Research's Scott Davis, who has a buy rating and $35 price target on GE stock, gave ""a B grade overall"" to that plan in a Monday note. Flannery's reset left him wanting more, and Davis suggested pushback from the board may help GE deliver on promises.Having an activist director was smart, Davis added, referring obliquely to Edward Garden of Nelson Peltz's Trian Partners. Garden joined the GE board just over a month ago.He believes things can get better for GE, if only because they can't get much worse.""Guidance was set appropriately low and seems very beatable,"" Davis said, adding that revenue upside offers ""incredible opportunity"" for investors.Shares of GE fell 5.9% to 17.90 on the stock market today after tumbling to 17.46 intraday, their lowest level since December 2011. GE crashed 7.2% on Monday.Among its industrial peers, Siemens (SIEGY) was fractionally lower, while Honeywell (HON), 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX) advanced.RELATED:Why General Electric's Radical Moves Are Making The Stock Fall HarderAs GE's Moment Of Truth Nears, Look For Answers To These 4 QuestionsDow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And Analysis

135,UTX,"A couple of top-performing defense and aerospace ETFs have strikingly similar charts, yet their portfolios are significantly different.X SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense (XAR) and iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense (ITA) are both forming flat bases and are near buy points. SPDR Aerospace's chart shows a potential buy point at 83.05, while iShares Aerospace & Defense has a buy point at 184.70. It edged above that level Thursday but fell below it Friday in the general market sell-off.Both ETFs share the industry titans such as Boeing (BA), United Technologies (UTX), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Raytheon (RTN). The two funds have about 35 stocks each, but the portfolios are structured differently.SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense is an equal-weighted index in which small caps such as aircraft components maker Triumph Group (TGI) and rocket builder Orbital ATK (OA) have as much weighting as Northrop and Boeing, with market capitalization of $53 billion and $160 billion, respectively.IBD's TAKE: Making money catching ETF uptrends requires knowledge about how to read charts. You can learn how at IBD University.By comparison, iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF uses the Dow Jones U.S. Select Aerospace and Defense Index, in which Boeing has 10.5% of the weighting and Triumph Group only about 1%. The eight smallest components account for less than 1% each.Regardless of structure, the two ETFs have performed in a remarkably similar manner. Both have five-year average annual gains of about 24%, three-year average gains of about 18% (through Oct. 31) and year-to-date gains of around 30%.Most of the major defense stocks have performed quite well in 2017, and are trading near all-time highs.Defense stocks usually perform well even in times of peace, because defense spending rarely drops. This year, operations in Syria and Iraq against ISIS are winding down, but North Korea's fast-moving missile program poses new security threats for the U.S. and its allies. U.S. forces remain in battle against the Taliban in Afghanistan.Lockheed builds the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, which can shoot down short- and medium-range ballistic missiles. Raytheon builds the Patriot missile defense system. President Trump is seeking an additional $4 billion for missile defense programs amid rising tensions with North Korea.Commercial aviation is another major factor in these ETFs, and that business continues to roll on rising orders for more-efficient jetliners, a trend reinforced in this month's Dubai air show.""The order strength, and positive headlines against more modest expectations, at the Dubai airshow provide additional evidence of the strength in the commercial (plane) cycle,"" Canaccord Genuity analysts Ken Herbert and Jamaine Aggrey wrote in a report. ""We continue to see incremental risk on the wide-body outlook, but improving traffic and profitability with Middle East airlines"" in particular are positives.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

137,UTX,"Boeing (BA) rival Airbus (EADSY) disclosed Tuesday that there were ""certain inaccuracies"" with its regulatory filings regarding U.S. arms exports.XThe European aerospace and defense giant said the discrepancies were over payments to third-party agents who brokered sales of U.S. equipment to non-U.S. customers.The surprise disclosure adds to growing international scrutiny into the company's sales practices. The U.K. Serious Fraud Office and France's Parquet National Financier are looking into reports of alleged corruption. Germany and Austria are also investigating Airbus.Airbus said it is in talks with the State Department and Justice Department and couldn't say yet if there would be a fine, but warned of potential penalties in the U.K. and France.For now it's ""business as usual"" with the U.S., which continues to grant Airbus export licenses, Chief Financial Officer Harald Wilhelm told reporters.Airbus' U.S.-listed shares shot up 4.1% to close at 25.67 on the stock market today, hitting a record high. Boeing dipped 0.5% to 257.98, remaining in buy range.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? IBD's Leaderboard is outperforming the S&P 500 so far this year.On the commercial side, Airbus said would miss its target of delivering 200 A320neo planes this year, as United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney unit is behind in its deliveries of jet engines.In July, Airbus said Pratt & Whitney has to ""work harder"" to fix delays and reliability problems with the Geared Turbofan. United Tech said last week that it has shipped 245 Geared Turbofan engines so far this year and backed its target of 350-400 deliveries for 2017. Management also said the company is speeding up production for the engines used in the A320neo.Airbus also said adjusted Q3 earnings fell to $811 million while sales rose 2% to $16.57 billion, both topping views.RELATED: Boeing Can't Shake Air Force Tanker Costs; Outlook Implies Weak Q4 Airbus said would miss its target of delivering 200 A320neo planes this yearDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

138,UTX,"The Dow Jones industrial average and, briefly, the S&P 500 index undercut their 50-day moving averages, while the Nasdaq composite pulled back from a record high. Fears that President Donald Trump will impose sweeping tariffs on Chinese tech and telecom products worried investors and slammed Boeing stock. Trump also blocked Broadcom (AVGO) from buying Qualcomm (QCOM), though chip stocks still outperformed. United Airlines raised forecasts and faced yet another public relations fiasco. Adobe Systems (ADBE) rallied on earnings and guidance. General Electric (GE) dove on dividend fears.Stocks ran into turbulence amid concerns that President Trump will soon levy stiff tariffs on Chinese goods over their trade and investment practices. Trump also nixed a possible Broadcom (AVGO) takeover of Qualcomm (QCOM). Boeing (BA), which sells a lot of planes to China, tumbled through its 50-day line. The Dow Jones industrial average, which reclaimed its 50-day line on Monday, fell back below that level, led by Boeing. The S&P 500 index undercut its 50-day line on Thursday, but moved back above that area on Friday. The Nasdaq composite hit a record high Tuesday intraday, but reversed to close lower that day and in the next two sessions.Broadcom (AVGO) withdrew its $117 billion bid for rival chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) after President Trump signed an executive order blocking the deal on national security grounds. Broadcom is shifting its headquarters to the U.S. from Singapore, but the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States cited concerns about its ties to China, including firms like Huawei. The interagency body also was worried that the U.S. would lose its leadership position in 5G wireless technology if Qualcomm was acquired by the notoriously low-R&D Broadcom. Analysts say Broadcom is likely to remain acquisitive, but will pursue smaller chip firms. A day after abandoning its pursuit of Qualcomm, Broadcom reported fiscal first-quarter sales and earnings that beat Wall Street's targets, but gave in-line revenue guidance for the current quarter amid a sharp decline in wireless chip sales.The digital media and marketing software firm earned an adjusted $1.55 a share, up 65% year over year, on sales of $2.08 billion, up 24%, in its fiscal first quarter ended March 2.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLumentum Holdings (LITE) will buy Oclaro (OCLR) for $1.8 billion in cash and stock, raising speculation of consolidation among fiber-optic component makers. Lumentum stock has outperformed its optical peers in 2018, owing to its push into a new market as a supplier of 3D sensors to Apple. That stock run-up gave it ammunition to purchase Oclaro. While much speculation centers on Finisar (FNSR) as a possible buyer, its stock has lagged. Analysts view Acacia Communications (ACIA), Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI), and NeoPhotonics (NPTN) as possible targets.United Airlines (UAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Hawaiian Airlines parent Hawaiian Holdings (HA) hiked their first-quarter unit revenue forecasts, against a backdrop of solid travel demand. At an airline conference, United defended its decision to keep adding flights, while American Airlines (AAL) said Wall-Street sell-offs to signs of more expansions, competition and in turn fare discounting were an ""overreaction.""

Meanwhile, online travel agency Ctrip.com (CTRP) also took a dive after reporting Wednesday, despite EPS falling less than expected and revenue rising 34% to $980 million.Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) beat earnings estimates, as did its full-year earnings-per-share outlook. While revenue and same-store sales missed, the retailer expects ""stronger product innovation from select key partners"" and ""less margin pressure than previously expected."" The results come as sports retailers face heavy competition and discounts. Dick's last month said it would stop selling assault-style rifles completely and ban gun sales to customers under 21 following a mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla. Hibbett Sports (HIBB) edged past earnings estimates with sales in line.

FireEye (FEYE) jumped on speculation that it could be a takeover target.Dollar General (DG) investors had a few dollars more in their pockets after the stock spiked Thursday on bullish guidance for 2018. The firm met expectations with EPS of $1.48, while same-store sales growth was above some estimates.Industrial supplies distributor HD Supply (HDS) punched through its 50-day line after reporting a Q4 beat and giving bullish guidance Tuesday. Earnings rose to 49 cents a share while revenue was $1.18 billion.Williams-Sonoma (WSM) beat fourth-quarter expectations on what the upscale home furnishings retailer was ""substantial acceleration in e-commerce and retail revenue growth."" The company also hiked its dividend and expanded its buyback program.Toys 'R' Us will liquidate all its U.S. stores amid stiff competition and high debt payments from a private-equity buyout.

But after losses Tuesday, most were pointed higher slightly higher Wednesday morning.Trump is looking to slap tariffs on $60 billion worth of Chinese imports, focusing on tech and telecom products, Reuters reported late Tuesday, while CNBC said the actions could include investment curbs and even visa restrictions. That followed a Politico report during the market session that Trump had rejected a $30 billion China tariff figure as too low. Trump plans to target tech and telecom products to punish China for forcing U.S. companies to give up intellectual property rights to operate in the country.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Boeing was slightly higher early Wednesday.The Dow Jones component expects China to buy thousands of planes in the coming decade. China's state-owned airlines could easily favor Airbus (EADSY) in the event of a trade war. Boeing also is somewhat exposed to the Trump tariffs on steel and aluminum.Apple lost 1% to 179.97, undercutting a 180.71 buy point. Apple makes most of its iPhones and other gadgets in China via Foxconn and other contractors. China also is a huge consumer market for Apple, though the iPhone has had some struggles amid fierce local competition. Apple, a Dow stock, rose 0.5% early Friday.Intel, another Dow Jones stock, closed up 0.5% to 51.78. But the stock initially shot up to 53.78 intraday on relief that the world's largest chipmaker was less likely to make a defensive offer for Broadcom (AVGO) after Trump blocked Broadcom's ambition to buy Qualcomm (QCOM) on national security grounds. Intel down more than 1% late Tuesday, edged higher Monday.Micron Technology has been on a huge run, and edged up 0.3% to 158.22 on Tuesday, paring intraday gains.

140,UTX,"The SEC probe into how General Electric (GE) records revenue for servicing industrial equipment raises significant risks for the troubled industrial giant, according to a Wall Street analyst.X GE disclosed during its Jan. 24 quarterly report that it is being investigated by Wall Street's government watchdog. Financial regulators are looking into both what led the company to take a worse-than-feared $6.2 billion charge to its insurance reserves, as well as whether its accounting and controls for long-term service agreements (LTSAs) may have been lacking in any way.The service agreements — a major part of what GE calls ""contract assets"" — are troubling to John Inch of Deutsche Bank. They have become bigger drivers of GE's slowing profits, even though they are drawn in large part from GE's severely challenged power business, he wrote in a Jan. 29 analyst note.""LTSAs potentially comprised 22% of GE's earnings in 2017 — a sizable step-up from 16% in 2016 despite the 2017 collapse of the Power business,"" he noted.That discrepancy highlights issues tied to the value of GE's contract assets. One is that GE often books revenue before it actually gets paid by customers. Another is that the ongoing downturn in the power market heightens the risk that GE may have to revise down the value of its contract assets, Inch said.""If GE were required to revise down the value of its contract assets (which are based on internal company assumptions), this would result in negative drag to the company's book value — coming at a time of rapidly rising GE Industrial debt,"" Inch added. Ultimately, a potential write-down could hurt Wall Street's consensus 2018 EPS guidance of $1 for GE, pushing its share price even lower, he said.Shares of GE slipped 2% to 15.95 stock market today, closing below 16 for the first time since Dec. 1, 2011. Dow industrial peers 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX) posted losses of 1.75% and 0.1%, respectively, while Siemens (SIEGY) was flat and Honeywell (HON) gave up 1.5%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.GE's contract assets have grown steadily in recent years to roughly $25 billion in 2016, and GE expects that figure to increase to roughly $30 billion in 2018.In recent notes, analysts besides Inch addressed the SEC inquiry into the Boston-based company's contract asset accounting and insurance processes.Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research suggested Jan. 24 that GE's accounting may have been too aggressive, saying more charges or write-downs are possible before GE files its annual 10-K report. Steve Tusa of JPMorgan said Jan. 26 that the probe lends support to concerns around potential shareholder lawsuits.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:How To Choose The Best Online Stock Brokers: Start HereBest Stocks To Buy And WatchHow To Invest In The Stock Market Using A Simple Routine

Business software, cloud computing, and video game hardware giant Microsoft (MSFT), a Dow Jones industrials stock, rose 0.5% to 96.99. The stock is up 13.3% since Jan. 1 and has rallied 70% following a late July 2016 breakout from a saucer-like base with a 56.87 buy point.The S&P 500 was virtually breakeven. The S&P SmallCap 600 erased mild early losses and gained 0.4%.Volume is now edging slightly higher vs. the same time Friday on the Nasdaq, indicating that institutional demand is not receding, even after the composite index surged 4.2% last week.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, ship transport, automaker, telecom, building-related products, data storage and oilfield services firms also rallied with gains of 1% or more. But shoe, auto parts, truck, construction machinery, movie, aerospace and wireless telecom service stocks fell 1% or more.Just three of the 30 components within the Dow industrial average climbed 1 point or more, including IBM (IBM) (still deep within a base) and Goldman Sachs (GS) (trying to clear a 273.89 entry in a new flat base). Fellow Dow Jones 30 member Intel (INTC) struggled, losing 0.84, or 1.6%, to 51.35. Volume was running 12% above average.Intel last week hopped out of a flawed cup base that formed in less than six weeks. Yet the chipmaking titan is having a positive 2018 so far, up more than 10%. The Santa Clara, Calif., tech bellwether has enjoyed healthy double-digit profit increases in five of the six past quarters, up 21%, 4%, 22%, 22%, 26% and 37% vs. year-ago levels.The Street expects Intel to grow first-quarter profit by 8% to 71 cents a share.Four components in the price-weighted Dow also sank 1 point or more, including Home Depot (HD), Caterpillar (CAT) and United Technologies (UTX).Leading companies, in terms of fundamentals, relative price strength and quality fund sponsorship, include Alibaba (BABA) (basing), Broadcom (AVGO) (also in a base), Booking Holdings (BKNG) (up 7% from a breakout point at 2,068.09 and thus extended) and Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) (slightly out of the 5% proper buy zone after clearing a flat base at 170.40).Ligand was showcased in IBD's Stock Spotlight column on March 6, two days before the stock broke out of its five-week flat base, one of the most important chart patterns that can help growth investors time their buys for maximum gains and minimum risk during a confirmed stock market uptrend.On Friday, the IBD Big Picture column noted that the rise by the Nasdaq composite to all-time highs ended the ""Uptrend under pressure"" phase that began on March 1.All four companies have a record of smashing the performance of the S&P 500 and other benchmarks. Only Broadcom, still in a quest to acquire fellow wireless chip technology giant Qualcomm (QCOM), is lagging the S&P 500 in year-to-date performance. Broadcom, however, gapped up more than 3% to 262.58 in fast turnover and is now up more than 1% year to date.Broadcom, the product of a mega-merger with Singapore's Avago Technologies, is up 554% since clearing a nearly 18-month base-on-base pattern with a 39.84 buy point in the week ended Sept. 20, 2013. The company has superior earnings growth, with profit rising 29%, 38%, 51%, 46%, 42% and 32% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters.Revenue picked up 119%, 125%, 134%, 18%, 18%, and 17% in the same time frame. The merger between Broadcom and Avago accounted largely for the triple-digit top-line gains in prior quarters.Analysts see earnings in the January-ended fiscal first quarter rising 39% to $5.03 a share on a 28% jump in sales to $5.32 billion.As noted in IBD's Earnings Calendar, Broadcom is slated to report Q1 results on Thursday.Like the one formed recently by Ligand, a good flat base must form over a minimum five weeks and correct no greater than 10% to 15% from head to toe. Such action indicates tight price action and a general unwillingness among large fund managers to dump their shares.Ligand has scored a ninth straight advance, rising more than 2% to 179.92 in volume running more than 100% above usual levels. Before the stock broke out, its relative strength line jumped into new high ground, a bullish sign.The relative strength line, painted in blue in all IBD charts and in MarketSmith, compares a stock's price performance with the S&P 500.On Feb. 21, the specialist in developing treatments for numerous difficult and chronic diseases posted a 77% leap in fourth-quarter profit to $1.31 a share as revenue rose 32% to $50.5 million.As noted in this IBD New America piece, Ligand earns royalties based on the therapies and technology platforms it sells to larger pharmaceutical and biotech firms. In February, management noted it currently has 165 platforms in development together with more than 95 business partners.Ligand joined IBD Leaderboard last week.Shares are up more than 30% since Jan. 1, while at 2786 the S&P 500 is up 4.2%. The Nasdaq composite is up nearly 10%.Alibaba, one of China's leading e-commerce firms, had a huge 2017 as shares rolled 96% higher that year, vs. a 19.4% lift by the S&P 500.The stock sprinted higher in January, then caved in step with the market. However, notice how the stock refused to sink below its long-term 200-day moving average (visible as the black line on a MarketSmith chart). After a strong run-up, it's not uncommon for leading stocks to not only sharply undercut the 50-day moving average but also test buying support at the 200-day line as well.The 200-day moving average traces a stock's average price close over the past 200 trading sessions, or roughly 10 months' of price action. You want to see the 200-day line rising. Plus, a leading stock will lead its 50- and 200-day moving averages higher.Alibaba has fallen a mild 18% in its current base, which so far has the makings of a cup base.The latest pullback is not a proper handle. Why? The midpoint test shows that the handle didn't form up high enough within the cup itself.The midpoint of the cup (the base's intraday high plus intraday low, divided by 2) is 187.54, while the midpoint of the handle is 185.30.In a good cup with handle, the midpoint of the handle is usually higher than the base's midpoint. A good cup with handle must also form within a minimum seven weeks.Alibaba has scored EPS gains of 39%, 30%, 37%, 60%, 63% and 25% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters. Such results help boost the stock's Earnings Per Share Rating to a 97 on a scale of 1 to 99 in IBD Stock Checkup, and the megacap member of IBD's Retail-Internet industry group shows an equally robust 98 Composite Rating.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see first-quarter earnings rising 49% to 94 cents a share.One concern is that fourth-quarter aftertax margin fell by 970 basis points to 32.5% vs. the year-ago period. That broke a two-quarter string of rising net margins.The Dow transportation average, a 17.3% gainer in 2017, fell nearly 0.6% before rebounding some and is now off 0.2%. At 10,712, it's up almost 1% since Jan. 1.In other financial markets, WTI crude oil futures fell 1.7% to $60.92 a barrel while gold, silver and copper futures backtracked 0.3% to 0.6%.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond edged lower to 2.88%, still up from 2.41% at the start of the year.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more analysis and commentary on growth stocks, breakouts, and financial markets.)RELATED:Inside IBD's Stock Spotlight: Can This Hot China Consumer Spending Play Break Out Again?Who Are The Global Stock Leaders On Wall Street?Intel, Broadcom, Qualcomm Buzz Has A Lot To Do With AppleThese 5 Top China Nets Have New Bases, Buy PointsHow To Score Big Profits With A Small Account?

143,UTX,"United Technologies (UTX) lifted full-year forecasts Tuesday after topping Q3 estimates, led by growth at its jet engine unit, which is making progress on resolving problems in its Geared Turbofan engine.Estimates: EPS to slip 4.5% to $1.68 while revenue grows 3.7% to $14.89 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: EPS dipped 2% to $1.73 as revenue grew 5% $15.06 billion. Organic sales rose 6%. Sales at the Otis elevator unit rose 4.6% to $3.16 billion. Climate, controls and security sales climbed 6.2% to $4.69 billion. Pratt & Whitney jet engine sales increased 10.6% to $3.87 billion. Aerospace systems sales were flat at $3.64 billion. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 11% at both Pratt & Whitney and aerospace systems.Orders for new equipment at Otis were down 4% on a constant-currency basis, while climate, controls and security saw a 2% increase in organic orders.Outlook: United Tech raised its full-year earnings estimate to $6.58-$6.63 from $6.45-$6.60. It sees sales of $59 billion-$59.5 billion, up from $58.5 billion-$59.5 billion. The Dow industrials component still sees 3%-4% organic growth.Stock: Shares fell 0.9% to 119.76 on the stock market today, falling back below a 120.05 buy point on a cup-with-handle base after hitting 123.28 intraday. Fellow Dow component General Electric (GE), which slashed its guidance last week, slipped 1.9% after diving 6% on Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.United Tech has been grappling with problems in its new Geared Turbofan engines, which have delayed Airbus (EADSY) A320neo deliveries.In July, Airbus said Pratt & Whitney has to ""work harder"" to fix delays and reliability problems. United Tech said Tuesday that it has shipped 245 Geared Turbofan engines so far this year and backed its target of 350-400 deliveries for 2017.Management also said the company is speeding up production for the engines used in the A320neo and Bombardier's C Series aircraft.Meanwhile, United Tech reached a deal last month to buy aerospace supplier Rockwell Collins (COL) for $30 billion, including debt.The combination of United Tech, whose Pratt & Whitney unit makes jet engines, and Rockwell, which makes cockpit and communications systems, is seen as one of the biggest aerospace deals ever, and may draw a challenge from Boeing (BA), which is looking to keep it market share in the lucrative maintenance and repair business.The United Tech-Rockwell deal comes as Boeing ramps up its parts sales and services business, which provides maintenance and technical support and was launched on July 1.""We believe this deal is partly in response to the increased pricing pressure from the leading aerospace OEMs (Airbus and Boeing) and the increased push by the leading OEMs, notably Boeing, into the commercial aftermarket, traditionally the source of most industry profits and cash flow,"" said Canaccord Genuity analyst Ken Herbert said in a note last month.But as United Tech gets bigger, other industrial heavyweights like GE and Siemens (SIEGY) are getting smaller. General Electric said last week it will streamline its business by $20 billion, with thousands of layoffs expected. Siemens may cut thousands of workers at its power-and-gas and process industries, Bloomberg reported last week.United Tech needs to break up some of its assets to ""unlock the conglomerate discount and bring this deal to its ultimate logic,"" according to Vertical Research Partners analyst Jeff Sprague.In a Setember note, Sprague wrote that a spin-off of United Tech's buildings units, which includes Carrier air conditioning and Otis elevators, ""could unlock upwards of $20/share in value"" and would be ""the logical conclusion"" to the Rockwell transaction.RELATED:GE Under Pressure To Cut Dividend After Slashing Cash Flow OutlookBoeing May Challenge United Tech's Buyout Of Rockwell CollinsHoneywell's Expected Spinoffs Fall Short Of Investor's PlanHoneywell To Spin Off 2 Units; Pfizer Mulls Consumer Sale; P&G-Peltz Proxy Fight Today

145,UTX,"As we move through May, the old Wall Street adage ""Sell in May and go away"" comes to mind, a reminder that stocks historically tend to underperform during the May-to-October period.But does that mean ETF investors should liquidate their holdings, take the summer (and a few extra months) off, and resume buying stocks in November?That's one investment strategy. But, as with most old sayings, it doesn't have to be taken literally. Even if the market's return tends to be bigger in the November-April period, investors sitting out the other six months miss out on intermediate rallies and on the power of reinvesting dividends and compounding returns.That's why Oliver Pursche, chief executive of Bruderman Brothers and Bruderman Asset Management, doesn't think the adage proves advantageous for most investors.""It is at best unreliable and inconsistent and amounts to market timing,"" he told IBD. ""When taking into account possible tax consequences, missed dividends and trading commission, the math doesn't bear out.""But Pursche, who oversees the New York-based firm's investment banking and wealth management divisions, thinks May is a good time for investors to reassess their portfolios.Click Here To See A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2017Bruderman Asset Management is a registered investment advisor (RIA) with more than $1 billion in assets under management.Here are Pursche's three best ETF investment ideas, in his own words:""Sell in May and walk away"" is not a strategy we feel is particularly smart or beneficial to investors. However, as we enter the summer months and the second half of the year, there is a need for investors to revisit their investment thesis and potentially reallocate their portfolios. After a solid double-digit run by the S&P 500 since Mr. Trump was elected president, a portfolio risk assessment is certainly due. Investors should expect a continuation of the current positive sentiment, even though the Trump administration is unlikely to pass any major legislation, in particular tax reform. Nonetheless, there are several key factors that are benefiting our economy and consequently, corporate earnings.The United States economy, as well as the world as a whole, is benefiting from a cyclical rebound in growth and consumer demand that is helping drive corporate earnings higher, and could help boost U.S. GDP growth by 4% or more in the second quarter. One phenomenon that has been interesting to observe in the current earnings cycle is the strength of earnings coming from outside the United States. Of the companies within the S&P 500 that have reported earnings so far, those companies that earn more than 50% of their revenues offshore have seen EPS growth of nearly 20%, while companies that derive all of their earnings domestically are experiencing low- to middle-single-digit EPS growth.One last note: Expect a correction at some point, but don't let that change your long-term investment strategy. The ETFs named above should perform well if the current environment persists through the end of the year and into 2018, as we expect it to.RELATED:This ETF Is Knocking The 'Socks' Off The Tech Sector

146,UTX,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) expects more international orders for its F-35 fighter aircraft and the company's missile-defense system, as global tensions spur demand for U.S. military hardware.But the defense giant's stock retreated to its buy point following Lockheed's first-quarter sales miss and weak earnings guidance.During Lockheed's conference call Tuesday, CEO Marillyn Hewson said that 50% of F-35 orders over the next five years will be from international customers as Lockheed sees interest from countries outside the current program of record.Partner countries on the F-35 include the U.K., Italy, the Netherlands, Japan, Turkey, Australia and Israel, among others. Last year, Lockheed said it was in talks with Spain, Belgium and Switzerland about selling them the F-35.Meanwhile, North Korea's recent missile tests are speeding up deployment of Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system to South Korea, and the company expects interest in THAAD from Middle Eastern customers.Raytheon's (RTN) Patriot air-defense system has also been in demand in the Mideast and Asia. After the company landed big orders from Saudi Arabia in 2015, South Korea and Japan now plan to upgrade their Patriot systems, and a contract topping $7 billion is expected soon from Poland. Lockheed makes the PAC-3 missile for the Patriot system.Lockheed has set a goal to expand its foreign sales to 30% of total revenue in the next few years, and the Trump administration has been supportive of sales to allies. A $5 billion sale of 19 Lockheed F-16 fighter jets to Bahrain was recently cleared, as U.S. allies in the region face intensifying friction with Iran.Hewson said Tuesday that Lockheed is continuing to look at opportunities to sell the F-16 abroad, especially to India, which could be a bigger buy than the Bahrain order. Shares of Lockheed fell 2.2% to 270.02 on the stock market today, trading just above and below a 270 buy point for much of the session, on mixed quarterly results and weak guidance.Northrop Grumman (NOC), which is a major F-35 subcontractor and reports Wednesday, lost 0.4% to 248.13, just below a 249.53 buy pointutx. United Technologies (UTX), which makes the F-35's engines and also reports Wednesday, rose 0.5%.Lockheed reported adjusted EPS of $3, with revenue up 6.7% to $11.1 billion. Analysts were expecting EPS of $2.79 on revenue of $11.23 billion. Aeronautics sales, which include the F-35, jumped 8% to $4.1 billion. Rotary and Mission Systems sales, which include Sikorsky, edged up 2% to $3.1 billion. Missile sales rose to $1.49 billion while Space division sales climbed 12% to $2.36 billion.The company now sees full-year EPS of $12.15 to $12.45, below the Wall Street consensus for $12.64 and down from an earlier outlook of $12.25-$12.55, and sees sales of $49.5 billion-$50.7 billion, with the midpoint slightly below consensus for $50.18 billion and up from an earlier outlook of $49.4 billion-$50.6 billion.In addition to foreign orders, Lockheed expects to reach a deal with the Pentagon for an 11th batch of F-35s, with a finalized contract expected in Q3.Lockheed started deliveries from the ninth F-35 production lot in Q1, after a $6.1 billion contract for 57 planes was signed in November. An $8.2 billion contract for the 10th batch, which covers 90 F-35s, was signed in February, though deliveries aren't expected until next year. The company is planning to transition to full-rate production in 2019.But as Lockheed looks to ramp up production, there are questions as to whether it will be able to meet its delivery goal of 66 jets this year. The Pentagon's Defense Contract Management Agency told Bloomberg that Lockheed will likely only deliver 57 F-35s this year, as it's failed to meet its contract requirements since 2014. But Lockheed insists that it will meet its target of 66.Lockheed is also working to push costs of the F-35A, the basic model ordered by the Air Force and most international partners, to under $80 million per plane in 2019 or 2020, down from $95 million currently. But Tanner said the lower cost won't negatively impact profit margins.But testing delays with the F-35 could add over $1 billion to the cost of the stealth fighter as well as postpone the Navy's timeline for declaring its version of the jet combat ready next year, according to a Government Accountability Office report out Monday. But the Pentagon offered lower estimates for cost growth and denied that there will be any impact on the Navy's or international partners' schedules to declare their variants combat ready.Lockheed is still bullish on its Sikorsky division, even though it didn't deliver a single commercial helicopter in Q1. Still, the company expects to finish the year delivering over 180 helicopters, in line with 2016 deliveries.In addition to Northrop, Boeing (BA) and General Dynamics (GD) will report Wednesday, and Raytheon is scheduled for Thursday.RELATED: Dow's Boeing Nears Buy Point Ahead Of Q1 Results, But Revenue To DropLockheed's F-35, F-22 May Soon Face Their Moment Of Truth

148,UTX,"Markets abhor uncertainty. And perhaps nothing breeds more uncertainty than a war that starts with a surprise attack like the Korean War in the early 1950s.To the investor, wars create volatility and opportunity.You do not have to be able to predict such events. But you do need to be flexible and know when to quickly raise cash to avoid huge losses in stocks. Then you must be able to buy with conviction when the market, via the follow-through bottoming signal, has given investors a green light to buy leading new stocks.IBD teaches such techniques via this column and the Big Picture. Market timing is essential to making great trades.On Sunday, June 25, 1950, the North Korean People's Army surprised South Korea and a small contingent of U.S. military personnel, pouring south across the 38th parallel. The next day, North Korean tanks were at the outskirts of the South Korean capital of Seoul.The day after that, President Harry Truman secured a United Nations resolution calling for military assistance to the South. Truman named Gen. Douglas MacArthur to head two U.S. divisions in what he called a ""police action."" For the next three years, the U.S. would fight a difficult and costly war to an eventual standstill that lasts to this day.Kim Jong Un, the grandson of Kim Il Sung, the supreme leader who launched North Korean forces against the South, is in charge today, still raising havoc in the region.The Monday morning after the attack in 1950, the Dow fell 4.7%. The next day, the market lost 0.8%, with volume reaching the heaviest since September 1939, when Nazi Germany invaded Poland. From a June 12 intraday high to a July 13 low, the Dow lost 14.8%. Yet the correction was contained; the Dow had just about recovered its loss by September, when U.S. forces launched the Inchon invasion and the liberation of Seoul.The Korean War had important consequences for the economy. Rather than build deficits, Truman preferred a pay-as-you-go strategy. Supported by Congress, he raised income, corporate and excise taxes to record levels in 1950 and 1951.At the war's outbreak, inflation skyrocketed as consumers hurried to buy, fearing shortages. Prices rose 11% from the war's onset until price controls were imposed Jan. 26, 1951. In its last year, war expenses made up 14.1% of GDP.Dwight D. Eisenhower was elected in November 1952 on a platform of ending the war. An armistice went into effect on July 27, 1953.The market's advance once the war was underway was mild and choppy. Still, some winners emerged. One winner was United Aircraft, later to become current Dow Jones industrial average member United Technologies (UTX), which owned the Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Engine Co. Pratt & Whitney built jet engines used in fighters and bombers. United broke out of a cup-with-handle base in 1949. By 1953, 87% of sales were to the government. It gained 256% in 169 weeks.Better bets surfaced at the end of the war when price controls and materials restrictions were lifted. Enter Outboard Marine, a maker of outboard motors. It expanded its offerings to include snowblowers, lawn mowers and chain saws, and its earnings and stock price exploded.Following a strong breakout in January 1954, Outboard gained 720% in 177 weeks, ascended into a climax run on a 3-for-1 stock split and gave a clear sell signal.

150,UTX,"Activist investor Third Point's proposal for Honeywell (HON) to spin off its aerospace division comes just as the industrial giant's new CEO, Darius Adamczyk, settles into the job, and the hedge fund's timing is ""intriguing,"" according to one analyst.Adamczyk became Honeywell's CEO and president this month, succeeding former CEO Dave Cote, who remains chairman. The change in management, RBC Capital said, could work in Third Point's favor.""New CEOs are often more willing to rethink an organization's portfolio,"" analyst Deane Dray said in a research note. ""But Dave Cote is still Chairman and we will have to see how much of a fight he will make now that his retirement process has been set in motion.""He also noted that the industrials sector is currently in an ""'urge to demerge' mode"" and that Honeywell could be the next illustration of a trend toward keeping it simple. He didn't name examples, but General Electric (GE) has largely shed its finance unit, and United Technologies (UTX) sold its Sikorsky unit to Lockheed Martin (LMT) in 2015.""There are also lingering memories of (Honeywell's) high-profile United Technologies pursuit that was eventually abandoned in early-2016, which would have meaningfully increased the aerospace exposure of the combined company,"" Dray noted.Honeywell shares rose 1% to 131.13 on the stock market today, after hitting 135 intraday. GE, which has said it would tie bonuses to profit and cost-cutting targets amid pressure from Trian Fund Management, slipped 0.3%. United Tech edged up 0.15%.Honeywell has said it would review Third Point's plan to spin off the aerospace business, a move the hedge fund said could increase shareholder value by more than $20 billion.Third Point, in its first-quarter investor letter on Thursday, said Honeywell's aerospace business ""is the chief cause of Honeywell's discounted valuation"" and was better off on its own. The fund argued that the aerospace segment had not kept up with rivals and was the primary reason behind weaker earnings at Honeywell.Honeywell, which makes airplane engines and other aircraft parts, cut its full-year sales forecast in January, citing weaker demand in corporate jets amid global trepidation about the economy and less traction in defense.However, the company, a supplier of Boeing (BA) and Airbus (EADSY), beat first-quarter earnings expectations last week. And Lockheed Martin said it expected more orders internationally for its F-35 jets, which use equipment provided by Honeywell.Third Point, which CNBC reported substantially added to its Honeywell stake, said that separating the aerospace segment would help turn Honeywell into ""an industrial growth company with a focus on automation and productivity.""Honeywell, in a statement Thursday, said ""we intend to take the time necessary to ensure a comprehensive, informed and objective review of the potential separation of the Aerospace business."" The company said that it will ""continue executing its 2017 plan.""""We have a strong portfolio of businesses with great positions in growing industries. Aerospace is no exception,"" the statement added.RELATED:Raytheon Sees 'Significant Demand Signals' As Syria Heats UpThe Brains For Lockheed's F-35 Just Got Smarter

151,UTX,"In a very busy week for news, stocks rallied solidly. Markets worldwide cheered the results of the first round of France's presidential election. Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Dow stock McDonald's (MCD) hit record highs on earnings, while Intel (INTC) and Starbucks (SBUX) tumbled, with hundreds of other companies reporting. President Trump's big tax-cut plan, which had lifted markets in anticipation, didn't move the needle when its outline was finally released.The major market averages jumped Monday and Tuesday after Emmanuel Macron led the first round of voting in the French presidential election, with polls suggesting he will easily defeat nationalist Marine Le Pen in the early May runoff. Stocks largely consolidated gains the rest of the week, though individual stocks and sectors were active amid a flurry of earnings. Internet, chips, restaurants and casinos were leaders, while Baidu (BIDU), Intel and Starbucks showed that even leading groups had losers. But the Nasdaq composite hit record highs during the week, climbing 2.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.9%, while the S&P 500 index was up 1.5%, just below all-time bests.The e-commerce giant said adjusted income rose 38% year over year to $1.48 a share, beating the consensus Q1 estimate of $1.12. Revenue rose 23% to $35.7 billion, topping views of $35.3 billion. That maintained a steady streak of double-digit revenue gains going back more than four years.Amazon Web Services, Amazon's cloud computing unit, continued to deliver huge, if gradually slowing, growth.Amazon shares rose to a record high Friday, clearing a new buy point, but closing well off intraday peaks.The earnings of Google-parent Alphabet rose 28% as revenue rose 22%, to $24.75 billion. Analysts expected the company to report earnings of $7.40 a share on sales of $24.22 billion. Revenue at Google's ""other"" non-advertising business — which includes its cloud computing unit, Pixel smartphones and the Play store — rose 49%, to $3.01 billion. Mobile advertising growth was a bright spot, although Google's rising traffic-acquisition costs are a concern. TAC refers to what Google pays partner websites to carry ads, or what it pays partners like Apple (AAPL) that generate search traffic. Alphabet shares gapped up 3.8% to a fresh record high Friday.McDonald's first-quarter results beat views, and the burger giant talked up its tech efforts, including expanding delivery, trying out mobile order and pay and its new digitized restaurant layout. Shares jumped to record highs. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) also beat and said it was testing GPS-tracking technology. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) beat as well, and analysts debated its progress following a food-borne illness scare. Starbucks matched profit expectations, but missed on sales amid worries about stalling growth. Starbucks shares undercut a recent buy point intraday Friday, but closed above that level.Software leader Microsoft (MSFT) delivered earnings per share above views for its fiscal third quarter, but sales came in a tad short. Its sales guidance for the June quarter also was below analyst estimates. Microsoft earned 73 cents a share excluding items, up 18% year over year, on adjusted revenue of $23.56 billion, up 6%, in the March quarter. Analysts expected 70 cents and $23.62 billion. For the current quarter, Microsoft guided to sales of $24.15 billion, up 7%, but Wall Street had been modeling for $24.51 billion.Intel earnings topped, but the chip giant's sales fell shy amid weakness in its data center market, sending shares gapping down 3.5% Friday. Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), Mellanox Technologies (MLNX), KLA-Tencor (KLAC) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) were chip plays that retreated. But Cavium (CAVM) and Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) rallied after the chipmakers topped Q1 earnings. Gear makers Teradyne (TER) and Ultra Clean (UCTT) boomed on results.Lockheed Martin (LMT) sees more international demand for its F-35 fighter and missile-defense systems as global tensions heat up and Raytheon (RTN) sees ""significant demand signals"" for its munitions on increasing military operations in Syria. Lockheed's Q1 sales fell short of expectations and it gave weak guidance. Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD) topped on EPS and sales. All four defense stocks were in buy range at some point in the week, but by Friday's close all were slightly below entry areas.Core Boeing (BA) earnings jumped 16% to $2.01, beating views, but revenue fell 7% as defense revenue fell 18%. Free cash flow soared to $1.63 billion from $527 million. The aerospace giant raised its full year EPS outlook, but the midpoint still fell below analyst views. Industrial conglomerate United Technologies (UTX) topped with slim EPS and sales gains, as Otis elevator revenue, aerospace system sales and Pratt & Whitney jet engine sales rose.Boeing shares rose toward a flat-base buy point. United Tech is at a 23-month high, at the edge of buying range.Western Digital (WDC) and Seagate Technology (STX), the two largest providers of disk drives, had differing earnings.

Western Digital's earnings beat on the top and bottom lines, and announced very bullish guidance, sending shares up 3.9% Friday.Wynn Resorts (WYNN) pulled ahead of forecasts with 99 cents EPS and $1.475 billion in sales, as Macau gaming activity continues to rebound. Las Vegas Sands (LVS) EPS rose 47% to 66 cents, topping, on 15% revenue growth, meeting views. MGM Resorts (MGM) topped handily on both the top and bottom lines, helped by the takeover of the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa and the MGM National Harbor opening. Wynn Resorts hit a two-year high, and MGM rose to its best since 2008, with shares in buy range. Sands advanced within a consolidation.Exxon Mobil (XOM) reported mixed first-quarter results but said it had no plans to adjust its capital expenditure guidance as the oil major has identified and captured capital efficiencies. Exxon warned that it still needed to be cautious on the rebalancing of the oil market. Chevron (CVX) swung to a profit in Q1 and revenue beat Wall Street estimates as overall production rose. Management said if oil remains around $50 a barrel then future spending would be near the low end of its capex forecast. U.S. oil prices are modestly below $50 a barrel as Baker Hughes announced the U.S. oil rigs in operation rose for a 15th straight week, foreshadowing further production gains.T-Mobile US (TMUS) topped Q1 earnings estimates and continued its streak of grabbing the most new subscribers among wireless operators. T-Mobile added 798,000 postpaid phone subscribers vs. 877,000 in the year-earlier period; that topped estimates of 725,000. T-Mobile shares rose to a new high, in buy range. AT&T (T) is expected to ramp up advertising for bundled wireless and pay TV offers after reporting in-line EPS and revenue that fell more than expected. AT&T lost 348,000 wireless postpaid subscribers, more than expected. Subscriber growth at DirecTV Now's streaming service helped AT&T offset surprising weakness at DirecTV's traditional pay TV business. But AT&T shares fell to 2017 low.Separately, cable giant Comcast (CMCSA) rose to a new high on strength in its movie business and broadband-customer gains.Recall costs and slowing U.S. sales hurt Ford (F) earnings, which fell but still beat Q1 views.

The results come amid concerns about slowing auto sales, rising inventories and falling used-car prices.Dow Jones industrial average equipment-maker Caterpillar (CAT) earned $1.28 a share in Q1, more than doubling estimates, and raised its 2017 revenue range by $2 billion to $39-$41 billion, vs. estimates of $38.3 billion. Caterpillar's good news comes despite lack of progress on President Trump's infrastructure program or border wall, two initiatives that have made Caterpillar a Trump stock. Ahead of earnings, Caterpillar finally broke a 51-month streak of falling retail sales, with a 1% gain that was driven by construction equipment sales in the Asia-Pacific region. Caterpillar shares soared into a buy zone.Biotechs and drugmakers reported en masse Thursday with AbbVie (ABBV), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) delivering across-the-board beats, pumping their stocks up that day.

The catalyst was an especially strong earnings report from Anthem (ANTM), though investors may have judged that TrumpCare remains doomed. Humana (HUM) previewed its earnings and raised guidance. Centene (CNC) topped estimates and CEO Michael Neidorff said he expects the Medicaid-heavy insurer to thrive on any reform that can be passed by Congress, noting that ""20 Republican senators come from states that expanded Medicaid.""PulteGroup (PHM) topped earnings estimates, but revenue fell short. Meanwhile, President Trump imposed a 20% tariff on Canadian softwood imports, which could raise construction costs by $1,200 per home. New-home sales rose in March to the second-fastest rate of the current business cycle. Pulte tumbled, but did not outright close below a prior buy point. D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar (LEN) fell below their 50-day lines as well.

154,UTX,"Industrial giant General Electric (GE) missed quarterly forecasts early Wednesday, but backed strong earnings guidance, while fellow Dow component United Technologies (UTX) beat views and guided earnings above consensus.X Investors initially cheered the GE news but then its chief financial officer told analysts on a conference call that U.S. regulators are investigating a recently announced insurance charge and its chief executive said the company intends to make further changes to its portfolio, but will continue to exist.""There will be a GE in the future, but it will look different than it does today,"" CEO John Flannery said on the call. His comments followed reports in mid January that GE is open to a big breakup.Estimates: Fourth-quarter earnings to tumble 39% to 28 cents a share, as revenue dips 1% to $32.69 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. Last week, GE said it would take a $6.2 billion Q4 charge on its legacy reinsurance business.Results: EPS of 27 cents, excluding the insurance loss, tax cuts and other ""industrial portfolio actions,"" on revenue of $31.4 billion. Total organic equipment orders fell 5%, and organic services orders also dropped 5%. Backlog grew by $13 billion vs. Q3 to $341 billion.While the overall top line was weak, the three segments GE has said it plans to focus on, power, aviation and healthcare topped some expectations. Power revenue fell 15% to $9.42 billion. Aviation revenue was flat at $7.22 billion. Healthcare revenue rose 6% to $5.40 billion.Meanwhile, oil and gas revenue jumped 69% to $5.76 billion, renewable energy revenue rose 15% to $2.88 billion, transportation revenue sank 20% to $993 million, and lighting revenue fell 7% to $546 million.Outlook: Full-year EPS is still seen at $1.00-$1.07, largely above the consensus for $1.00.Stock: Shares were down 2.3% at 16.50 on the stock market today, after rising as much as 2.8% earlier in the session and 5% in premarket trading.In recent months, the troubled Boston-based company has cut 2018 guidance, halved its dividend and vowed to slim down its complex structure and portfolio. Other clouds that have hung over GE include major challenges in its energy, power and finance units, the Trump tax cuts and cuts to its long-term debt rating.While GE has said it plans to shed $20 billion in assets and concentrate on its three core industrial businesses, it has also acknowledged a breakup into separate public companies may also be necessary.IBD'S TAKE: Investing for income alone can be risky.

155,UTX,"As General Electric (GE) gets ready to kick off a busy week of industrial earnings, the troubled conglomerate on Monday extended its recent slide following an analyst downgrade.X GE and fellow Dow industrial United Technologies (UTX) report results for the fourth quarter Wednesday, with Honeywell (HON) set to follow Friday. Discussion of 2018 outlook is also in the cards.On Monday, Bank of America Merrill Lynch downgraded GE shares to neutral from buy, warning investors that the industrial giant is likely to slash its 2018 outlook when it reports Q4 results.Our outlook ""reflects lower earnings estimates, zero equity value assigned to GE Capital, and lower value assigned to GE Digital initiatives, as we don't see the market paying up for this optionality,"" CNBC quoted BoAML analyst Andrew Obin as saying. ""The relative size of the charge vs. expectations and limited disclosure related to potential off-balance-sheet liabilities once again raise a question about the credibility of the current guidance and capital structure framework.""Here is what to watch when GE and its industrial peers report.Analysts see Q4 earnings tumbling 39% to 28 cents as revenue slips 1% to $32.69 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Shares fell 0.55% to 16.17 on the stock market today, hitting their lowest level since December 2011.GE booked a 13% weekly loss Friday, after announcing it would take a $6.2 billion after-tax charge against fourth-quarter earnings. The charge relates to a legacy insurance portfolio in its finance arm, raising worries that GE's industrial businesses may eventually have to shore up GE Capital with cash.As investors watch for signs of more potential liabilities in the finance unit, they also will tune into commentary around GE's troubled power business. GE Power saw profit plunge 51% in the last quarterly report, amid a severe downturn in the overall market for gas-power generation.GE's 2018 rally has proved to be short-lived, with the stock back at the very bottom of the 30 blue-chip stocks on the Dow Jones industrial average, booking a 7% loss this year so far. GE's status in the Dow industrials may be in doubt.GE CEO John Flannery said Jan. 16 he is open to a more radical breakup than he originally envisaged in November, and a major activist investor has reportedly pushed for such action. Many GE watchers think not even a big breakup will halt the slump in GE stock, while others believe it could prove transformative.While GE also said Jan. 16 that it expects full-year 2017 earnings to be at the low end of the $1.05-$1.10 range, analysts such as Morningstar's Barbara Noverini are watching whether ""industrial cash from operations may exceed the latest $7 billion forecast"" and whether its cash squeeze will worsen under the Trump tax cuts.The Boston-based company slashed its dividend and 2018 outlook in half in November. Yet its latest woes have analysts like BoAML's Obin worried about further cuts to earnings targets.As GE stock continues to fall, its dividend yield now stands at 3%.IBD'S TAKE: Investing for income alone can be risky if you chase stocks just because of their high dividend yields. Learn how to buy the best dividend stocks that combine yields with earnings growth and a solid share price trend.United Technologies should see flat Q4 EPS of $1.56 despite a 5% increase in revenue to $15.40 billion.Shares slid 0.5% to 135.21 Monday afternoon The stock has advanced 9% from a 123.38 cup-with-handle entry in seven weeks, and is up 5% year to date.Analysts will closely watch for updates on Geared Turbo Fan (GTF) production and deliveries, from its Pratt & Whitney division, and on United Tech's recently announced acquisition of Rockwell Collins (COL).Pratt's shift from legacy engines toward the GTF has pressured earnings, but the GTF could transform into a significant profit driver over the next decade. It also may give United Tech an edge in the next-generation midsize aircraft, or NMA, market.United Technologies competes against fellow Dow stock GE in jet engines.Besides jet engine makers, United Technologies units include the makers of Otis elevators and Carrier air conditioners. A spinoff of those units could unlock major value, analysts say.Carrier axed more than 200 workers in Indianapolis earlier this month, with those jobs are going to Mexico, where workers make about $3 an hour, Reuters reported.Honeywell should see Q4 EPS rise 6% to $1.84 as revenue grows 7% to $10.69 billion.Shares dipped 0.1% to 158.54, still within buying range from their recent breakout past a 156.80 flat-base entry.Honeywell in December guided Q4 and full-year 2017 EPS to the high end of its previous range, while offering a conservative 2018 outlook. Analysts said that the latter fit the company's pattern of underpromising and overdelivering on financial results.The outlook call showed progress in one of new CEO Darius Adamczyk's top priorities — organic revenue growth, according to Noverini. The company is targeting 2% to 4% organic revenue growth vs. five- and 10-year CAGRs of less than 2%.That will be an area of scrutiny when Honeywell reports, especially for its aero business.Honeywell plans to spin off its home and global distribution business, as well as its transportation system business, by the end of 2018. Investors will be watching whether those spins are tracking to plan.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:If General Electric Breaks Up, Should You Break Up With GE's Stock?This Top-Performing Dow Titan Is Reaping The Benefits of RestructuringHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

164,UTX,"The major indexes mainly treaded water late in Tuesday's relatively quiet session. The Dow Jones industrial average, however, is showing bullish action by maintaining strength at its 50-day moving average.The Dow Jones industrials, enjoying strong gains by the likes of industrial giants Caterpillar (CAT) and United Technologies (UTX), edged up around 0.1% during a day of narrow-range trading. That's in contrast with Monday, in which the 30-stock blue-chip index fell to an intraday low of 20,517, but bounced higher after a challenge of support at the key 50-day moving average.The Dow showed an earlier test of strength at this intermediate-term support line on March 27.Cat tried, but failed on Tuesday to climb back above its 50-day moving average. Leading stocks tend to travel above their 50-day lines in preparation for a potential breakout. The good news for Cat shareholders is that the stock is trading less than 6% below its 52-week high of 99.46.United Tech, meanwhile, has made limited upside progress since the stock rallied past a 109.52 cup-with-handle entry point in late November and early December.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite were practically flat. However, losing stocks were outpacing winning issues by a nearly 4-to-3 margin on the Nasdaq. On the NYSE, winners and losers were roughly evenly matched. The Russell 2000 lost 0.2%.Volume was running mildly lower vs. the same time Monday on both main exchanges.While the medical sector remains a laggard, here are four stocks to consider for your watchlist. PRA Health (PRAH) is ranked No. 32 on the IBD 50. The stock edged 0.2% lower to 64.62, but is showing gains after busting through stubborn resistance at 60.The Raleigh, N.C., clinical trials firm has grown earnings per share 108%, 74%, 34%, 34%, 23% and 20% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters. Due in part to a tough year-over-year comparison, Wall Street sees earnings up just 9%, to 60 cents a share, in Q1.PRA holds a good 94 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99 from IBD Stock Checkup.Celgene (CELG) has been trading quietly lately, but at 124.35 the top-performing biotech is still up nominally from a Feb. 28 breakout past a 122.49 cup-with-handle entry.Celgene is trading firmly above its 50-day moving average, which itself has been rising for more than six weeks. A 73 Relative Price Strength Rating is not superb, but it's a meaningful improvement from as low as 35 eight weeks ago. A 73 RS rating means that the large-cap biotech, which specializes in treatments for cancer and immunological disorders, is now outperforming 73% of all stocks in IBD's database over the past 12 months.Other notable leaders in IBD's biotech group are Incyte (INCY) and small-cap epilepsy and ADHD specialist Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN). Both are up sharply for the year so far. A fourth  member of the biotech group is Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), which rose 4% to 111.45 in heavy trading, four days after it zoomed up 20% in massive trading on positive clinical trial data regarding its two-pill treatment for cystic fibrosis.And Loveland, Colo.-based Heska (HSKA), a thinly traded expert in veterinary products, continues to soar after it cleared a 57.51 buy point in huge volume on Nov. 1.Keep in mind that Heska, up 2% to 104.37, trades just 102,000 shares a day. Elsewhere in the stock market today, InterActiveCorp (IAC) roared off its 50-day line, rising more than 2% to 75.73 in heavy volume.The search engine operator has found nice support at its 50-day for months, after the stock cleared a 60.40 buy point within a long bottoming-base pattern in October last year.On Feb. 2, InterActiveCorp staged a profit turnaround with fourth-quarter earnings rising 84% to $1.38 a share, crushing the consensus analyst estimate by nearly 47%, despite a 4% drop in sales. That halted a four-quarter streak of shrinking profits.Now, Wall Street has revised full-year EPS estimates higher, with 2017 earnings seen up 13% to $3.34 a share and 2018 earnings up 32% to $4.41.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Is It Time To Take Profits In These 5 Leading Techs?The Income Investor: Will These 3 Dividend Leaders Finish Big In 2017?Inside The IBD 50: These 7 Leaders Are Thriving, Even After Testing The 10-Week Moving Average

165,UTX,"February's stock market performance serves as a reminder that volatility can still take a bite out of market leaders like Apple (AAPL), Adobe Systems (ADBE), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL). After a stunning 2017 in which everything worked, the market entered January with aggressive buying, sending the major indexes to all-time highs.X But February started with a shocking reversal. The market experienced its first correction, defined as a 10% drop, in two years. The S&P 500's 10.2% decline was as swift as it was dramatic. It lasted just nine days, ending Feb. 8. But the damage was done.Despite bouncing back the last three weeks, the benchmark ended the month down 3.89%. It's first monthly loss since March 2017. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 4.3% in February, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. U.S. diversified stock mutual funds lost 3.61% according to Lipper Inc. Surprisingly, S&P 500 Index funds beat the index by 18 basis points, down 3.71%, according to Lipper.General domestic taxable bond funds average a loss of 0.8% in February and were down 0.75% year to date.""The past month has been a snapback of the previous month,"" said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide Funds. In January investor sentiment turned aggressive, especially in technology, buying went a little too far too fast, Hackett said. Then at the beginning of February it reversed, partly triggered by the specter of rising interest rates.""It was indiscriminate selling,"" said Hackett. ""Even the names you would think of as safe havens didn't work because people thought of the defensive stocks, like telecom and utilities, as bond proxies and sold them. The fact we had a correction is not the slightest bit unusual and actually a healthy thing. You get a pressure valve release, so things don't get overheated and people don't get too complacent.""David Joy, the chief market strategist for Ameriprise Financial, said he wasn't surprised the market recovered quickly, ""because there was no change in the fundamental outlook. We think the economy will be quite strong and that we're going to get growth close to 3% this year.""The February bounce back came because of two events from Washington, the spending bill and tax reform, which combined should increase gross domestic product over the next two years by 50 basis points, said Lawrence Kemp, the portfolio manager of the BlackRock Capital Appreciation Fund (MAFGX). The fund was up 6.75% year to date going into Friday vs. the S&P 500's return of 0.49%, according to Morningstar.""That's positive for additional money for the consumer to spend and for corporations to invest and to increase dividends and buy back stock,"" said Kemp. ""It's a very positive tailwind regarding U.S. fundamentals and for very strong earnings growth.""We're overweight in technology,"" said Kemp. ""Financials will benefit from a rising rate environment.""Among the fund's top 10 holdings are five technology stocks, Amazon, Microsoft (MSFT), Google parent Alphabet, Facebook, Booking Holdings (BKNG) (formerly Priceline Group) and China's Tencent Holdings (TCEHY).His top financial picks are Visa (V) and Bank of America (BAC). He also said he thinks the health care sector and consumer discretionary stocks will do well this year. He likes UnitedHealth (UNH) and Constellation Brands (STZ), a beer and wine company.Hackett and Joy agree that technology and financials are likely to do well. Other technology companies to look at are the ones repatriating income back to the U.S., such as Apple (AAPL), Oracle (ORCL) and Cisco Systems (CSCO).As for financials, they say look at the large money center banks, such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS).  They both also see potential in late-cycle winners like industrials. This would include Boeing (BA), United Technologies (UTX)) and 3M (MMM).The names that were down because of interest rates have not bounced back nearly as much. Hackett said real estate is down 9% year-to-date, telecom is down 8% utilities are down 7% and consumer staples are down 7%, Names that were defensive and that you would expect to perform well in a volatile period to perform have not and are not viewed as defensive but as interest rates sensitive, and are suffering because of that.""We're also constructive on the international markets,"" said Joy. ""We like equity market in most parts of the world, developed and emerging, as there is a global recovery. There are not too many countries where the economies are not expanding. You still get very accommodative central bank policies in Europe and Japan and cheaper valuations.""""Even with huge upside in the U.S., we think foreign markets are one of the best places to be at this point, with the dollar weakening, the rest of the world lags the U.S. by two or three years,"" said Hackett, who said optimal international equity exposure would be 40%.RELATED:See What Leading Stocks Are Driving This American Century Growth FundNew To Stock Investing?

166,UTX,"General Electric (GE), an icon of American industry and the last remaining component of the original Dow Jones industrial average, now presents investors with a dilemma. At the brink of a potential breakup of the 126-year-old conglomerate, does the widely followed GE stock offer a transformational investment opportunity — or a dead end?X After years of attempts to remake the sprawling company, GE watchers aren't sure. Some say a GE breakup could unleash robust returns, but others see nothing but more damage to its already diminished value.After outlining a major slim-down in November, new GE CEO John Flannery is now open to a breakup, he revealed Jan. 16, and a major activist investor has reportedly pushed for it. But even breakup proponents say there's no quick fix for GE's problems. Indeed, key roadblocks, legal and otherwise, could make sticking together a better bet than a breakup for holders of GE stock.""GE cannot whittle down to three separate entities"" in power, aviation and health care, said Deutsche Bank analyst John Inch. ""Trust me, if it could, it would.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe breakup question comes as investors look for some upside to the beleaguered GE share price, which is at the lowest since December 2011. The company's status as an income stock play, a key reason to hold GE stock, was severely damaged after it halved its quarterly dividend to 12 cents a share in November. (The falling stock price, though, raises GE's dividend yield.)IBD'S TAKE: Investing for income alone can be risky if you chase stocks just because of their high dividend yields. Learn how to buy the best dividend stocks that combine yields with earnings growth and a solid share price trend. News of a potential breakup follows a disastrous 2017 for GE stock, which tanked 45% while the Dow Jones industrial average soared 25% and fellow Dow industrials 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX) jumped a respective 32% and 16%. GE's low price could even threaten its status as a Dow component. Other industrial conglomerates like Siemens (SIEGY) and Honeywell (HON), which also have also taken steps to slim down recently, saw hefty 2017 gains too.But you can't blame GE for not trying. The company is vastly different from what it was a decade ago. It has shed its stake in NBC Universal and most of one-time profit driver GE Capital, as well as its iconic lighting and appliance businesses. Former CEO Jeff Immelt sought to refocus GE on its industrial core and rebrand it as a ""digital industrial"" company, touting its efforts in software and the cloud.But that failed to arrest the decline of GE stock. Immelt stepped down as CEO in June after a 16-year tenure, and General Electric's longtime chief financial officer left in October. Soon after taking over as CEO, Flannery laid out plans in November to unload another $20 billion in assets and focus on the company's aviation, health care and power segments, which together account for most of GE's industrial revenue and profits.Yet the plan pleased almost no one, neither analysts seeking a radical restructuring of its vast asset portfolio nor investors looking for a clear path back to growth. It also left lingering concerns over the flagship power segment, which sells gas turbines and other utility equipment, where plunging profits led to 12,000 GE job cuts in December. Analysts caution that the power market is in the early stages of an extended downturn.The sale of other, smaller businesses had been telegraphed by GE, so Flannery's November announcement produced little sense of a bold vision. Then came the Jan. 16 bombshell that GE was on the hook for $11 billion in charges from its long-term care insurance portfolio and new U.S. tax laws. Management acknowledged more drastic moves might be needed. GE stock ended last week with a 13% loss, marking its worst week since 2009.GE shares fell a fraction Monday ahead of the company's fourth-quarter earnings report on Wednesday. Some analysts expect GE to slash 2018 earnings guidance again.""We are looking aggressively at the best structure or structures for our portfolio to maximize the potential of our businesses,"" Flannery said on a conference call. A review ""could result in many, many different permutations, including separately traded assets really in any one of our units, if that's what made sense.""For now, GE says everything is on the table, include outright sales and spinoffs. Flannery also floated the idea of staged exits, akin to the merger of GE's oil and gas division into Baker Hughes last July to form Baker Hughes a GE Company (BHGE).Other equity analysts look on GE more favorably. The conglomerate is now an asset story, and GE's well-established aerospace and health care segments would make exceptional stand-alone businesses, Scott Davis of Melius Research told IBD. Those two units alone are worth more than the entire market cap of GE, he says, while accounting for less than 40% of GE's revenue.GE Aviation is ""one of the best aerospace assets out there,"" Davis wrote in a December sum-of-the-parts analysis. He sees significant long-term value in the Leap engine and says aviation should enjoy strong services demand in the next two to three years.Here's What Fidelity Stock-Picker Will Danoff Likes Now – And What He Says About GEAnd General Electric could easily spin off its health care assets to ""unlock value"" in GE stock, similar to Siemens' upcoming IPO of its Healthineers unit, he adds.While Davis calls GE's power business severely challenged due to the rise of renewable energy, he believes it is fixable, with room for positive surprises down the road.Besides, Davis notes, the shareholder bases for GE's core businesses are completely different. For example, power holds appeal as a dividend payer and aviation as a secular growth engine.More immediately, he says Flannery should focus on cutting costs. That includes everything from general corporate expenses to its global research centers and its Predix software platform for the industrial Internet of Things. Many of these he describes as ex-CEO Immelt's ""very expensive investments that have just not panned out.""Since GE's Jan. 16 investor update, Davis has even more conviction in a GE breakup scenario.""The recent news helps confirm the fact that GE is too complex in its current form,"" he said. ""The conglomerate structure incentivizes wasteful and duplicative spending, while stifling the true earnings power of the underlying businesses.""But GE may not be able to take bold action without a feat of financial wizardry. What remains of GE Capital is saddled with $97.5 billion in debt, and the company is on the hook for more than $31 billion in underfunded pension liabilities, Deutsche Bank's Inch said in a Jan. 17 note to clients. GE is unlikely to separate aviation, power and health care into three stand-alone companies, especially since its industrial businesses backstop GE Capital's debt, he argues.""A separation of GE could carry serious ramifications in the bond market on which GE continues to heavily rely"" to fund the pension plan and operations, including the risk of litigation from GE Capital bondholders, he wrote.GE bonds also risk a rapid debt downgrade if General Electric gets rid of cash-generating businesses, which it can ill afford as a company on the hook for billions in pension obligations, he said in an interview.Other risks to GE stock loom. Inch cited billions in potential liability tied to the long-term-care insurance business, an ""inexplicably low"" tax rate that is almost certain to rise over time, a ""completely ineffective board"" that failed its duty to provide oversight and the ""very large, looming threat"" of class-action lawsuits from shareholders who may now feel misled.Before November, ""the company was adamant everything was great, the dividend was safe and secure,"" said Inch. ""I don't see how a company so large sees its earnings and dividends collapse. Somebody in the government, the SEC specifically, should be looking at what happened to get us to this point.""A GE spokeswoman said the company ""continues to work constructively with (government) agents as issues like that come up."" GE has set up a new board committee focused on capital allocation as it explores ""all options"" for its structure and portfolio, and is working through the legal and IP ramifications as part of its rigorous review, she added.For others, the math doesn't support the case for a GE breakup. A sum-of-the-parts analysis by Cowen's Gautam Khanna found GE's breakup value was 11-15 a share, below the current GE stock price near 16, after factoring in the underfunded pension and other debt-like items.""This implies that investors are currently ascribing a 'conglomerate premium' to GE's portfolio,"" Khanna said. In other words, asset sales are unlikely to add value, and a full GE breakup could even destroy value.And that doesn't account for operational synergies among the businesses that would be lost in a breakup of General Electric, he adds.Morningstar equity analyst Barbara Noverini also points out that innovations in one GE unit can provide solutions for another. For example, a subsea drilling platform in the oil and gas segment may draw from three other units: turbines from the power segment, distribution networks from energy management and imaging technology created in the health care segment.GE's complicated portfolio makes restructuring likely to be a multiyear slog, depressing earnings growth in the near term, she says. And in the GE dividend cut, the second in a decade, she sees ""a stark reminder that even great portfolios can suffer under the weight of poor capital allocation.""CFRA analyst Jim Corridore, too, points to synergies among General Electric's core units as a reason why a complete GE breakup is unlikely. The ""core R&D"" needed to make a gas turbine or an aircraft engine is basically the same, he says. Additive manufacturing technologies, or 3D printing, also connect its diverse business.""When you build a conglomerate, you build it for a reason,"" he told IBD. ""To break (conglomerates) up just because shareholders don't like the direction of the stock, that's no way to run a business.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:2018 Stock Market Forecasts: Read The Predictions For Top Stocks And IndustriesHow Did This Biotech Stock Become A Dividend Leader?This Top-Performing Dow Titan Is Reaping The Benefits of RestructuringAI In Business: What The Future HoldsHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

A pair of gold funds have been testing their 50-day moving average — and a solid rebound off the line could set up a buy opportunity. But Thursday morning, they gapped down below the support line, so keep watching to see if they can rebound back above it.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) closed at its 50-day line Tuesday and Wednesday. The ETF gained 7% after recovering the support line in December to its Jan. 25 intraday high. The $35.4 billion fund, which tracks the price of gold bullion, marked its 13th year in November.Smaller peer iShares Gold Trust (IAU), with $11.3 billion in assets, is also testing the 50-day line as it traces a similar pattern. It advanced 7% during the same period from December to its late-January peak. IAU is slightly younger — it turned 13 in January.GLD is up 1.2% and IAU up 1.1% year-to-date as of Feb. 27, according to Morningstar Direct, trailing the S&P 500's 3% gain. Longer-term average annual returns for both funds have lagged the benchmark S&P index — not surprising, given that the current equity bull market is in its ninth year.Gold, which has held above the $1,300 level this year, has long been considered a safe-haven defensive play. So gold prices often go up when stocks go down and risks are perceived as being high. The precious metal is also sensitive to inflation and interest rates. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday spooked the stock market when his favorable view of the economy caused investors to believe the Fed will raise rates more than widely expected.Even so, gold can continue to rise, according to CFRA Research. That's because despite its price appreciation last year, gold's relative valuation is still cheaper than stocks, CFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell wrote in a recent note.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD Newsletters""In summary, as CFRA looks to the remainder of the year, we think interest rates will increase at a moderate pace, the dollar will remain weak, and inflation will be contained,"" she said. ""We see gold as a smart and defensive way to diversify a portfolio in the later innings of a bull market and ahead of what has historically been a volatile year as midterm elections approach. Geopolitical tensions with North Korea remain, and while gridlock in Washington has abated for now, we view immigration and infrastructure spending as topics that could quickly drive its return.""Wednesday's pick, iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM), slipped below its 50-day line as stocks sold off. Keep an eye on it to see if it can regain the line and make a strong move.RELATED:Stocks Sell Off As Dow's Apple, Boeing Reverse And Celgene DivesHow Gold In A Portfolio Could Provide Returns, Liquidity And Diversification6-Year Downtrend Is Broken: A Renewed Case For A New Bull Run In Gold Prices

169,UTX,"President Trump has visions of a massive Apple (AAPL) factory opening in the U.S. to churn out the latest iPhone. The idea is not completely far-fetched, but one thing seems clear: If it happens, most of the new jobs will go to robots.Even in lower-cost China, Foxconn, which assembles the iPhone there, reportedly replaced 60,000 workers with robots at one facility. That's more than half the facility's workforce. Foxconn says it is adding 10,000 ""Foxbots"" per year.China has seen its cost advantage wither away due to wage gains. It's investing more than $3 billion a year in robots — up from next to nothing before 2009 — to keep from losing its manufacturing base to lower-cost developing nations, Bernstein analysts Michael Parker and Alberto Moel wrote in a December report.Trump has vowed to rewrite or walk away from trade deals and cut corporate tax rates to level the playing field for U.S. companies. He told Congress on Feb. 28 that he'll ""bring back millions of jobs.""Although economists concur that North American Free Trade Agreement and China's admission to the World Trade Organization have taken a toll on U.S. manufacturing jobs, Trump's battle plan seems geared to fight the last war.If China must shrink its costs with a massive deployment of robots, U.S.-based manufacturers that pay much higher wages and benefits will face the same pressures.A 2015 study by Boston Consulting Group found that an automotive industry welder earned about $25 an hour, including benefits, while a robot could do the job for $8 an hour, including installation, maintenance and operating costs. The gap is expected to widen sharply as technology improves.""It is still possible to force the relocation of production"" by restricting trade via tariffs or applying political pressure, wrote Bernstein's Parker and Moel. ""However, if the point of the exercise is to restore well-paying, middle-class jobs in manufacturing in the process, the result is going to disappoint. Mandating a physical task be carried out in a high-cost labor market in 2017 is simply going to increase the chances the task is automated.""Trump relentlessly bashed air conditioning company Carrier during the campaign for its plan to close an Indiana factory and move the work to Mexico. He intervened in December, saving about 800 jobs — for now. But Carrier's parent, United Technologies (UTX), which is getting $7 million in tax incentives from Indiana to stay, said it would invest $16 million to automate the factory ""to drive the cost down.""Like Apple, United Technologies is a member of Dow Jones industrial average.United Technologies CEO Greg Hayes told CNBC that while moving to Mexico would have been cheaper, the company will ""make that plant competitive just because we'll make the capital investments there, but what that ultimately means is there will be fewer jobs.""Mondelez (MDLZ), the maker of Oreos, was another regular Trump campaign target for its decision to cut 600 jobs from a Chicago factory and move the work to Mexico. The company said it considered installing new production lines at its Chicago Nabisco plant but chose to do the work in Salinas, Mexico, because of a $46 million cost differential. Mondelez noted that even if the project had gone forward in Chicago, half the jobs would have been eliminated because of new labor-saving technology.IBD'S TAKE: Since taking office, President Trump has talked less about the sticks he'll use against U.S. trading partners and more about the carrots he'll offer to manufacture in the U.S. via tax reform. But, for now, Trump's economic agenda and his tax cuts for business are stuck in line behind the ObamaCare repeal effort.The food and beverage industry is expected to be among the bigger adopters of industrial robots in coming years, says Boston Consulting Group, with automakers and electronics firms continuing to lead the way. Metals and machinery, rubber and plastics, and pharmaceuticals and cosmetics are also seen ramping up robot use. A 2016 McKinsey & Co. study concluded that 59% of manufacturing activities could be automated.Foxconn said in January that it's mulling a $7 billion highly automated factory for making displays, including flat-panel TVs and monitors, in the U.S. in partnership with Apple. Transportation costs for ever-larger displays, which aren't shipped by plane like the iPhone, are a driving force behind the plan. Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou said March 1 that such plans are on hold as the company waits to see what bills are passed and what incentives are offered.Pegatron, another Apple contract manufacturer that does assembly for Dell and HP Inc. (HPQ) out of plants in California and Indiana, reportedly said after Trump's election that it could expand its U.S. capacity fourfold, relying on automation and with a minimal increase in labor. The tech industry began formulating its response last year in the event that Trump was elected and turned out to be serious about imposing 35% tariffs on imports from China.Trump hasn't threatened such hefty tariffs in recent weeks. The focus has shifted to House Republicans' plan to slash the corporate tax rate to 20% and make export revenues tax-free. The 20% rate would apply to the full value of imports, raising $1 trillion over a decade that would effectively pay for the corporate tax cut. Still, economists who back the idea say that the dollar would rise 25%, offsetting any trade advantage. Major importers like Wal-Mart (WMT) hate the idea and trade experts warn that the WTO would likely find the import tax to be illegal.Some companies haven't needed new tax deals or threats to open factories in the U.S., but automation is key to their strategies.Adidas is a prime example. The maker of athletic shoes, which has long done its labor-intensive manufacturing out of China, Indonesia and Vietnam, last year piloted what it's calling a Speedfactory in Germany, making shoes almost entirely by robots. This year, the second Adidas Speedfactory is slated to open in Atlanta, where it's expected to employ 160 people facilitating the production of a half-million shoes.The high-tech operation, Adidas says, won't just eliminate the drudgery in manufacturing (along with a lot of the workers). It also will enable the company ""to make product for the consumer, with the consumer, where the consumer lives in real time, unleashing unparalleled creativity and endless opportunities for customization.""Meanwhile, Nike (NKE), another Dow industrials component, and Under Armour (UAA) are both developing strategies for manufacturing in the U.S., close to their customers. It's a safe bet that robots will be doing most of the work.The implications for workers are clear, says Boston Consulting Group. ""As U.S. factories adopt advanced manufacturing technologies, demand will surge for higher-skilled, white-collar workers who can quickly adapt to new technologies and processes, and demand will lessen for blue-collar workers who are trained in specific skills.""Despite his vow to bring back millions of jobs, Trump isn't oblivious to the job threat posed by robots. In a postelection interview, the New York Times asked Trump whether he was worried that companies will keep their factories in the U.S. but automate their workers out of jobs.""They will, and we'll make the robots too,"" Trump said. He added: ""Right now we don't make the robots. We don't make anything. But we're going to. I mean, look, robotics is becoming very big and we're going to do that.""Trump is more right than wrong about the U.S. ceding an opportunity, writes Frank Tobe, publisher of the Robot Report. ""Two-thirds of the robotics industry and 100% of industrial robots are manufactured outside of the U.S. by non-U.S. companies.""China's leadership has fully embraced the adoption of robots as part of its ""Made in China 2025"" strategy. The plan reflects not only wage pressures but demographics, as its working-age population shrinks. Whether the U.S. will avoid committing to robots for fear of displacing workers is a real question with serious competitive implications.Academics and industry leaders made the case in ""A Roadmap for U.S. Robotics"" last fall that robots have been a plus for manufacturing jobs. ""Over the last 5-6 years we have seen introduction of 600,000 new jobs in manufacturing. During the same period, we have seen significant growth in adoption of robot systems in industry,"" they wrote.Yet their upbeat predictions come with some uncertainty. The auto industry has been the biggest adopter of robotics, but that's happened as sales rebounded from just 10.4 million in 2009 to a record high 17.5 million in 2016. But if demand has peaked, as industry players suspect, then increasing automation may not be quite so positive for employment in auto manufacturing in the future.RELATED:U.S. Manufacturing Gears Up As 'America First' Trump Takes OfficeThe Top 10 Jobs Robots Could Steal From Humans By 2025Forget The Doomsday Clock, There's Now A Robot Fear IndexThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade

170,UTX,"ARLINGTON, Va. — The Air Force looks to be ""completely transparent"" about its secretive new stealth bomber, at least on Capitol Hill, while the Pentagon stays tight lipped in public about Northrop Grumman's (NOC) B-21 Raider.Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch, military deputy in Air Force acquisition, said he met with members of Congress on Wednesday to discuss a preliminary design review on the B-21 as well as provide a schedule of key milestones and other events expected with the bomber, which will replace Cold War-era Boeing (BA) B-52s.But it was unclear from Bunch's comments at an Air Force Association breakfast Thursday if his Capitol Hill discussions included cost figures, the lack of which has drawn stern warnings in the past from Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz.He has taken issue with the B-21's cost-plus contract, which puts taxpayers on the hook for any overruns, and with the Air Force's refusal to provide a full cost estimate. So far, the service has only put development costs at $23.5 billion and the per-plane cost at $564 million in 2016 dollars. Analysts, however, estimate the total acquisition price tag could hit $80 billion.""Why would you not want to tell the American people how you are going to spend their dollars?"" McCain asked during a hearing last year. The Air Force countered by saying it doesn't want enemies inferring the plane's capabilities based on price figures.But the B-21 isn't so secret that the Air Force won't disclose the identities of top subcontractors, who can help build more political support among lawmakers seeking Pentagon spending for their states and districts. They include United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney, BAE Systems (BAESY) and Rockwell Collins (COL).Northrop shares were down 1.5% at 240.28 on the stock market today. United Tech slipped 0.65% to 112.34 dropping back below its buy point, and Rockwell Collins climbed 0.4%, remaining in buy range. Boeing dipped 0.3%, still above buying territory.But Bunch warned that the public shouldn't expect more information anytime soon.""I don't see us releasing any more details for a period of time,"" he said. ""We've been very open so far. We need to watch how we are communicating. Right now, we've released enough.""RELATED: Air Force To Seek Proposals For Low-Cost Attack Plane ExperimentBattle Stations!

172,UTX,"The Trump administration is set to unveil a budget proposal in the coming week that will offer additional details about defense spending, making Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC), United Technologies (UTX), General Dynamics (GD) and Dow Jones industrial average component Boeing (BA) stocks to watch.The budget plan, which could be released Thursday, follows a broad outline last month that called for a $54 billion hike in defense spending but didn't specify what programs would benefit. It also didn't say how dollars would be split between new weapons, which would help the Lockheed Martins of the world, and personnel costs like uniforms, medical care and housing.During his campaign, Trump called for adding 78 ships to the Navy, at least 100 aircraft to the Air Force, and tens of thousands of troops to the Army and Marines. He has also backed efforts to recapitalize the U.S. nuclear arsenal, as Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon (RTN) and other defense contractors turn their sights to nuclear missile contracts that could be worth more than $90 billion.Lockheed Martin — which makes the F-35 stealth fighter jet, Sikorsky helicopters, missiles, and the littoral combat ship — has been trying to clear a cup base with a 270 buy point. Shares ended Friday at 268.66.The Pentagon's top supplier has taken some flak recently. Trump has said he wants to introduce competition into the business of building fighter jets, saying costs for the F-35 were ""out of control"" and that he wanted Boeing to ""price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet."" But such a shift would require a new competition and wouldn't show up in the upcoming budget. Meanwhile, Lockheed has been cutting costs on the F-35, with the latest production contract factoring in unit cost reductions of 7%-8%.

173,UTX,"Northrop Grumman spun off its shipbuilding operations in 2011, but it is developing the B-21 bomber, which could be worth $80 billion, and makes the Global Hawk drone.Northrop is also a major subcontractor on the F-35, making the center fuselage, fire control radar, and the communications and navigation system, while also helping develop the mission system and mission planning software.Other contracts are up for grabs. Northrop, Boeing, Lockheed, and privately held General Atomics are the likely bidders for the Navy's aerial-refueling drone, the MQ-25A Stingray.Northrop stock is making its way through a cup-with-handle base with a 249.53 entry. Shares are at 243.59.Shares of United Technologies, which makes the F-35's engines as well as the engines for other military planes and helicopters, has been testing support at its 50-day line.The stock, which is also a Dow Jones industrial average component, cleared a 112.93 buy point early this month but dipped back below it. Shares are at 112.14.General Dynamics, which makes tanks and Navy ships, broke out of a flat base in January with a 180.19 buy point. The stock is slightly extended above buying territory, but could drift back into range, which has an upper end of 189.20. Shares are at 190.84.In addition to passenger jets, the aerospace giant makes the Super Hornet fighter and the troubled KC-46 aerial refueling tanker, among other military aircraft.The stock cleared a flat base in January and has been trending toward profit-taking sell territory, which starts at 192.20. It closed at 178.70 on Friday.Trump has also criticized the costs of Boeing's Air Force One replacement program, but CEO Dennis Muilenburg has developed a friendly relationship with the president.

174,UTX,"Stocks opened higher Friday, as investors monitored an increasingly tense health care bill standoff in Washington.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.1%, the S&P 500 added 0.2% and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.5%.GOP lawmakers delayed a scheduled Thursday night vote on their American Health Care Act, intended to revoke and replace ObamaCare. Lack of support for the bill led President Trump to urge the vote be pushed to Friday, and White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney informed congressional leaders that the president had finished negotiating. He said if Congress was unable to pass the bill Friday, the White House would move on to other issues.How markets will react remains uncertain. The Dow industrial average ended Thursday down 1.2% for the week and tacking toward the index's worst performance since the week just prior to the Nov. 8 presidential election.

177,UTX,"General Electric (GE) may have been nudged by a major shareholder to consider a breakup, which the industrial giant signaled Tuesday is an option while announcing a multibillion-dollar hit from a legacy long-term-care insurance business.X Activist investor Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management is pushing the 125-year old industrial giant to explore possible sales or spin-outs of its sprawling businesses — including those in the core health and power segments, The New York Post said late Tuesday citing unnamed sources.Trian's founding partner Ed Garden, who also serves on the GE board, reportedly has been meeting with GE chief John Flannery recently. Trian declined to comment to the Post.""We are looking aggressively at the best structure or structures for our portfolio to maximize the potential of our businesses,"" Flannery said Tuesday in a call with analysts. He added ""separately traded assets really in any one of our units"" was an option. As recently as November, GE had said it would keep its key power, aviation and health care businesses even as it looks to exit several others.Trian has seen its stake in the Dow stock drastically dwindle in value since first making a hefty $2.5 billion investment in 2015, which the Post suggested came at the behest of former CEO Jeff Immelt. Trian bought GE at $26 per share. GE shares dived 4.7% to 17.35 on the stock market today, surrendering the last of their 2018 gains. GE hit 17.26 intraday,  just above a six-year low of 17.25 from Dec. 28.Among GE's industrial conglomerate peers, Siemens (SIEGY) and Honeywell (HON), which are also slimming down portfolios, were up 3 cents and 0.3%, respectively.

179,UTX,"General Electric (GE) is leaning toward a breakup, with a decision expected as soon as this spring, sources told CNBC Tuesday.X The report followed an announcement from the industrial giant earlier in the day that it would take a $6.2 billion Q4 charge on its legacy reinsurance business as well as comments from CEO John Flannery that the charge and results from the past several years ""only further my belief that we need to continue to move with purpose to reshape GE.""""We are looking aggressively at the best structure or structures for our portfolio to maximize the potential of our businesses,"" he said on a conference call, according to Bloomberg. A review ""could result in many, many different permutations, including separately traded assets really in any one of our units, if that's what made sense.""GE has already announced plans to shed $20 billion in assets and narrow its scope to just three businesses: aviation, power systems and health care, which together account for majority of GE's industrial revenue and profits.But that plan was widely panned after its was unveiled in November and failed to halt the stock's free fall, which was worsened by GE's halving of its dividend to conserve capital.GE shares were down 3.3% at 18.14 on the stock market today, falling back below their 50-day moving average after a two-week rally. Siemens (SIEGY) and Honeywell (HON), which have also taken steps to slim down recently, were up 0.7% and down 0.7%, respectively. United Technologies (UTX), which is acquiring Rockwell Collins (COL), lost 1.9%.IBD'S TAKE: This Dow giant just hit a buy zone on its 2018 outlook.

It will contribute about $3 billion in the first quarter of 2018 and roughly $2 billion each following year through 2024. To fund that, GE Capital will suspend dividends to GE for the foreseeable future.GE said the review and reserve testing, conducted with the help of outside experts, were tied to long-term-care policies reinsured by GE Capital's runoff insurance business, North American Life & Health. The moves will help restore GE Capital ratios to appropriate levels, he added, noting that the unit plays a key role in helping finance GE's portfolio of industrial products.""At a time when we are moving forward as a company, a charge of this magnitude from a legacy insurance portfolio in runoff for more than a decade is deeply disappointing,"" Flannery, who assumed the role of chief executive in August, said.Deutsche Bank research analyst John Inch flagged GE insurance risks in a Jan. 5 note. He noted that GE spun off Genworth, a big player in traditional long-term-care insurance, in May 2004, but the company has struggled with negative claims tied to its long-term-care portfolio since at least 2014.""Perhaps surprising to many, GE retained substantial long-term-care insurance policies that are now expected to cost the company billions of dollars,"" he wrote.

180,UTX,"UBS raised profit estimates for Boeing (BA) and other aerospace/defense giants like Lockheed Martin (LMT), United Technologies (UTX) and Raytheon (RTN) Thursday after lawmakers slashed the corporate tax rate.X In a note, analyst Darryl Genovesi said that tax reform will lower Boeing's effective tax rate to 18% from 28% and boosted his 2018 EPS estimate to $13.50 from $11.20, noting that production-rate increases on the 737 and 787 will also help. UBS raised Boeing's price target to 325 from 253 but kept its neutral rating on the stock.Shares of Boeing, which is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results Jan. 31, closed up 2.45% at 328.12 on the stock market today and have marched more than 10% higher in five days of consecutive gains.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Here are other estimates on earnings and the tax rates upon which they're based:Shares of Lockheed finished essentially flat at 331.13, United Tech edged up 0.1% to 134.99, Raytheon dipped 0.1% to 193.35, and GD rose 0.4% to 205.51.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:These Numbers Show How Much China, Asia Mean To BoeingDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

181,UTX,"Honeywell (HON) lowered its latest five-year demand outlook for civilian helicopters Monday, citing ""slowing economic growth"" and ""volatility"" in the oil and gas markets.The industrial giant, which supplies the helicopter sector, now sees delivery of 3,900-4,400 civilian helicopters in the 2017-2021 time frame, down by 400 from its 2016-2020 outlook, which was also 400 units lower than its prior five-year guidance.Purchase plans for new helicopters in North America dipped 2% from the prior forecast, falling for the second year in a row, according to Honeywell's annual survey of 1,000 chief pilots and flight department managers.Purchase plans in Latin America fell 13% on weakness from Brazil and Venezuela. In the Middle East, purchase plans were down 8%.""The current global economic situation is causing fleet managers to evaluate new helicopter purchases closely, and that's why we're seeing a more cautious five-year demand projection compared with previous years,"" said Ben Driggs, Honeywell Aerospace's Americas president, in a release.Honeywell shares fell 0.1% to 126.08 on the stock market today. Textron (TXT), which owns helicopter maker Bell, closed unchanged. Lockheed Martin (LMT), which bought helicopter maker Sikorsky in 2015 from United Technologies (UTX), fell 4 cents to 267.72. European aerospace giant Airbus (EADSY) eased 0.4%.The decline in planned helicopter purchases come as offshore drilling remains under pressure despite rising oil prices. Helicopters are used to ferry workers to offshore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico and North Sea.OPEC and top nonproducers like Russia agreed to cut production, but oil majors have shelved expensive offshore projects in favor for shorter-cycle shale projects onshore.RELATED: Dow Stock Exxon Mobil Sees $25 Billion In Capex, Backs Dividend Hikes

182,UTX,"The biggest battle in corporate America right now, over House Speaker Paul Ryan's border-adjusted tax, pits Boeing (BA), General Electric (GE), United Technologies (UTX) and other big exporters against major importers like Wal-Mart (WMT), Nike (NKE) and Best Buy (BBY).So far, the importers appear to be winning and they may have an ace up their sleeve: Ryan, the biggest proponent of a 20% tax on imports, is on the other side of the debate. At the moment, his policy agenda and political sway are in serious jeopardy.RyanCare, gravely wounded by the slings and arrows of both moderate and conservative Republicans, may have been buried by three words from President Trump in a televised interview on Wednesday night: ""I know that.""When Tucker Carlson of Fox News brought up an analysis showing that ""counties that voted for you, middle-class and working-class counties, would do far less well under the bill than counties that voted for Hillary,"" Trump could only agree.Trump acknowledged that ""a lot of things are inconsistent"" with his campaign pledge to replace ObamaCare with something terrific. ""These are going to be negotiated,"" Trump said, declaring, ""We will take care of our people or I'm not signing it.""In other words, RyanCare likely will only exist long enough to clear the House — if it even clears the House. As of Friday morning, the conservative House Freedom Caucus was still signaling its opposition, more than enough to defeat House Speaker Paul Ryan's repeal and replace of ObamaCare. That may be why Medicaid-focused insurers Molina Healthcare (MOH) and Centene (CNC) were rallying on the stock market. Molina rose 1.4% and Centene 0.3% Friday afternoon, turning slightly positive for the week.The House is penciling in a vote for next Thursday. If it passes, it will be up to the Senate to dramatically change a bill that the Congressional Budget Office says would result in 24 million more uninsured Americans while delivering a $600 billion tax cut.The take-away is that the process for drawing up ObamaCare repeal and replace will basically have to start nearly back at square one in the Senate, with hearings likely, along with in-depth negotiations about the size and form of tax credits, Medicaid cuts and incentives to keep people from going uninsured until they get sick. The CBO will, of course, weigh in, and the process may take months, likely delaying a tax reform push until late 2017 or even 2018.IBD'S TAKE: For now, financial markets are happy with just the idea of President Trump's big tax cuts and infrastructure spending. With all that fiscal fuel in the slow lane, the Federal Reserve can take its sweet time raising interest rates.
"
183,UTX,"""The complexity of the problems clearly suggests that taxpayer relief will not come before 2018 at the earliest, and neither will any of the planned increases in spending,"" wrote Mizuho Chief U.S. Economist Steven Ricchiuto.The bigger problem for Republicans — though not necessarily for companies opposing Ryan's border tax — is that there is a high chance of failure. The Senate is likely to find that the changes desired by moderates, including much bigger insurance subsidies for low-income and older Americans and retention of the Medicaid expansion, quickly start to resemble ObamaCare, more and more, both in policy and in cost.Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., has suggested providing bigger subsidies for lower earners, then applying the House bill's smaller subsidies above 250% of the poverty level. Depending on how high those low-income subsidies get, that's either a recipe for huge disincentives to earn more than 250% of the poverty level and a much more expensive bill, or else insurance would continue to be too expensive for lower earners to afford. These are the same kinds of issues ObamaCare wrestled with, often not very effectively.If House conservatives are unhappy that RyanCare is too far to the left, it's hard to see how they will stomach whatever might emerge from the Senate, which may have to scrap much of the $600 billion tax cut.One school of thought is that failure to repeal and replace ObamaCare could torpedo the rest of Trump's agenda. That's possible, but the only certainty is that failure will torpedo Ryan's agenda. Having been burned by taking on the thankless challenge of largely stripping away the ObamaCare health insurance entitlement, Republicans would be far too dispirited and fearful about their 2018 prospects to risk a contentious fight over a tax on imports that is ripe for populist attacks.That would be bad news for tax reform, since the border tax would raise $1 trillion to help pay for lower tax rates. Yet it's still possible that Republicans, with their backs to the wall, would relax their sense of fiscal responsibility to deliver a big, deficit-increasing tax cut.While Senate budget reconciliation requiring only a simple majority can only be used to pass legislation that is no worse than budget neutral beyond the 10th year, the GOP could use President George W. Bush's strategy of letting tax cuts sunset after a decade. Or the GOP could decide to blow up the Senate filibuster and enact permanent tax cuts, rolling the dice that Democrats won't control both the White House and Congress for years to come.Neither of those options is a sure thing. Some Republicans may not be willing to shed their fiscal conscience and the political left would surely holler about disastrous implications for Social Security and Medicare.Without a border tax, ""Republicans in Congress will have to choose between either accepting a modest version of corporate tax cuts with the standard rate falling only to the mid-high 20s (from 35% now) or allowing the deficit to increase materially,"" wrote Evercore ISI senior political strategist Terry Haines. ""Our big call is that in the end game — not necessarily now — what will give on tax cuts is fiscal discipline, so we maintain an above-market probability that deep corporate tax rate cuts will be achieved with a base case that the new rate does indeed end up down at 20%.""Haines adds: ""Stay long companies with above-average tax rates.""RELATED:CBO Reveals RyanCare Trick To 'Save' $600 Billion If Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May CollapseTrump's Big Speech Leaves Investors With Hope, Not Much Else Social Security Benefit Cuts In 2017 May Curb Trump's Plans How To Replace ObamaCare And Save Social Security The Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade

185,UTX,"Stocks expanded their midday gains Wednesday after the Federal Reserve, as expected, hiked short-term interest rates by a quarter-point but hinted that it would continue to act prudently before engaging in further increases in the cost of money.Meanwhile, oil stocks got a much needed lift after getting slammed in recent days as crude oil futures rallied. West Texas Intermediate futures rose more than 2%, to $48.79 a barrel. Meanwhile, the metals, medical, heavy industrial and transport sectors also showed resilience.For instance, airline industry leader Southwest Air (LUV) is halting a seven-session losing streak and reversed off its lows, with a 2% gain, to 53.90, in fast turnover. Watch to see if the consumer- and business-spending play can climb back above its 50-day moving average. Shares are still up 8% year to date, better than the S&P 500's roughly 6% advance. Randgold Resources (GOLD) surged 3.3%, to 86.97, and is trying to retake its 50-day line. AngloGold Ashanti (AU) jumped 7.1%, to 10.54, but remains far depressed from its 52-week highs.Meanwhile, in the steel sector, Leaderboard name and industry top dog Nucor (NUE) rallied more than 3%, to 62.72, in low volume; watch to see if it can keep climbing and pierce through the top of its three-week handle with a 65.50 buy point.Nucor is seen growing Q1 profit by 230%, to 76 cents a share. Earnings have rebounded 28%, 43%, 144% and 63% vs. year-ago levels in the prior four quarters. A fifth sector, banking, is also regaining some lost ground; Bank of New York Mellon (BK) rose 0.6%, to 48.56, and is close to surpassing a 48.88 buy point within a nine-week cup-with-handle pattern.Small-cap issues are leading the stock market today with the Russell 2000 up 1.2%, vs. a 0.6% lift by the Nasdaq composite and 0.7% for the S&P 500.The Dow Jones industrials lagged, up 0.4%, but at least five of the 30 components rose at least 1 point or more, including Caterpillar (CAT), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and United Technologies (UTX).  J&J has cleared a 122.60 early buy point within its long saucer construction. The left-side high of 126.07 also offers an entry point at 10 cents above that price.J&J has now risen slightly more than 5% past the early buy point. Be sure not to chase breakout stocks more than 5% past the proper entry. The reason: often a stock will pull back and try to shake out weak holders as it test support at or near the proper entry. IBD founder Bill O'Neil's study of the greatest market winners found that rarely does a leading stock market winner fall more than 7%-8% below the proper buy point in a cup, double bottom, flat base or other bullish pattern before a stock charges to new highs.Notice how, on the weekly chart, in six straight prior up weeks, J&J rose in above-average turnover in five of those weeks. That bodes well for the diversified medical products giant as it indicates surging demand for shares by mutual funds, hedge funds, insurers, banks and the like. J&J's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is now a sprightly A-; the proprietary grade goes from E (heavy distribution) to A+ (heavy accumulation).J&J's 66 RS Rating on a scale of 1 to 99 relects the big cap's long basing action and is sharply improved from as low as 26 just eight weeks ago. Among small and mid-cap names, focus on those with RS ratings of 80 or higher before they break out.Even with the move by the Fed to increase the fed funds rate to a 0.75%-1% target range, observers applauded the U.S. central bank's decision to maintain a careful and gradual approach to ""normalizing"" the bond markets.""The weaker dollar itself is a reflection of the Fed's policy path,"" Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial, told IBD. ""Markets see the Fed keeping a lid on the dollar and providing a bid for U.S. exporters, commodities and emerging markets.""The U.S. dollar fell against both the euro and the Japanese yen.In the meantime, keep an eye out for the reaction by European equity markets on Wednesday's Dutch elections, which are being perceived as a test of Europeans' tolerance of immigrants, particularly from the Middle East. The Dutch elections could also have ramifications for the future of the eurozone. In June last year, Britons shocked the world by voting to leave the single-currency region.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Should You Sell These 7 Dow Industrials Components Now?How To Invest: Why The Base-On-Base Pattern Makes Money For InvestorsThe Top Market Sectors Today: See IBD's Smart Research Tables

The Sunnyvale, Calif., maker of fiber-optic networking gear reported late Thursday a 136% gain in fiscal third-quarter earnings and a 23% rise in revenue, with both marking a third straight quarter of acceleration, but they were also below analyst expectations.

191,UTX,"If your ETF tumbled in the market sell-off, consider it a good sign if it's bouncing off the 50-day moving average.X That's what iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense (ITA) is trying to do, after it came 10.6% off its Feb. 1 peak. Shares are near the 50-day line. If it bounces back above the line, it would give the ETF a follow-on entry. But bear in mind that the stock market is on shakier ground, and buying any stock or ETF is riskier right now.The fund's so-far bullish reaction mirrors that found in the charts of its major components. Boeing (BA) is near new highs after making a second pullback to the 10-week moving average, a cousin of the 50-day average plotted on weekly IBD Charts.The company — the largest iShares U.S. Aerospace holding, accounting for more than 12% of  its portfolio — is seeing strong demand for its commercial jets, despite stiff competition from Airbus (EADSY). Reports say Boeing will form a joint venture with Embraer (ERJ) on the Brazilian company's regional jets.United Technologies (UTX) (8% of the portfolio) briefly erased a 13% gain from its 123.38 buy point before it bounced back temporarily. Lockheed Martin (LMT) (nearly 8%), Raytheon (RTN) (6.5%) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) (about 6%) have risen from pullbacks to the 50-day line.While the commercial plane business is helping mainly Boeing and its suppliers, the defense side of the ETF is witnessing its own boom. The Pentagon's National Defense Strategy published last month shows a shift from anti-insurgency warfare to fighting traditional foes such as Russia and China.""With the heightened focus on near-peer adversaries, such as China and Russia, we believe support for increased defense spending, and more importantly some of the specific areas of focus, will remain high,"" analysts at Canaccord Genuity noted in a Jan. 22 report.In the Defense Department paper, nuclear forces, cyberspace warfare, missile defense and command and control systems were some of the areas where modernization is planned, and where major defense contractors could play significant roles.Aerovironment (AVAV), Kratos Defense & Security (KTOS) and Cubic (CUB) are smaller holdings of iShares U.S. Defense that Canaccord says have high percentages of their business in defense. The fund has 40 total holdings.Defense spending rarely goes out of fashion, and the fund has a good long-term track record.

193,UTX,"The Geared Turbofan jet engine from United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney unit may transform from a drag on earnings to a significant profit driver over the next decade, according to one analyst.X United Tech invested roughly $15 billion in its next-gen Geared Turbofan (GTF), which allows different engine components to operate at different speeds, improving fuel efficiency while producing less noise and exhaust. Hopes were high as Pratt & Whitney sought to dethrone General Electric's (GE) Leap engine.But manufacturing issues and delays dogged the GTF, testing the patience of shareholders as well as customers like Qatar Airways and Airbus (EADSY). Delta Air Lines (DAL) also has ordered the engines for its 100 A321neo aircraft, set for delivery in early 2020. In October, United Tech backed its target of 350-400 GTF deliveries for 2017 as it resolves production problems.In a note to clients Wednesday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Matthew McConnell wrote that initial ""engine teething issues"" seem to have been fixed, paving the path for a successful ramp-up in GTF production and deliveries.""We believe the long-term growth opportunity at Pratt & Whitney is underappreciated, not just as the GTF ramps up and engine kinks are fully derisked, but also given the rich aftermarket opportunity from its large installed base of V2500s, competitive take-aways on key upcoming business jet platforms, and Pratt's sole-source position on all three Air Force mega programs,"" McConnell said.The Connecticut-based United Tech, a Dow Jones industrial average components, competes with fellow Dow stock GE and Rolls-Royce in the aerospace and defense markets, supplying engines to massive Pentagon programs like Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35.McConnell expects 2018 to mark the final year of margin headwinds in Pratt that have weighed on United Tech shares. The business could generate double-digit operating profit growth over the next 10 years, driving free cash flow of $10 per share by 2020, he estimated.However, he cautioned it is ""too early to declare victory"" on the GTF ramp-up, from 138 in 2016 to 700-plus in 2018. United Tech fell short of its target for 200 GTF deliveries in 2016, he added, and more challenges could result in ""further penalties and potentially order cancellations,"" weighing on investor sentiment.Shares of United Tech closed up 0.3% at 130.45 on the stock market today, after rallying 1.5% Wednesday on the RBC note, which also upgraded the stock to outperform. The stock is out of proper buy range after breaking out from a 123.38 cup-with-handle entry. GE rose 2.1%, Airbus jumped 2.5%, while Delta ended flat.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? IBD's Leaderboard  is a curated list of potential stock market winners.In his Wednesday note, McConnell also described United Tech's Rockwell Collins (COL) acquisition as a key free cash flow driver.""Rockwell Collins has among the stronger underlying outlooks of its commercial aerospace peers, driven by significant new content wins on next-generation platforms that position it well for the next five years,"" he said, while noting that the ""pricey"" $30 billion buy will likely deliver a return on investment in roughly five years.But the deal reportedly raised concerns from Airbus that it would keep United Tech from fixing the problems that delayed aircraft deliveries.MORE YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Dow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And AnalysisCES 2018 News: The World's Largest Consumer Tech ShowQ4 Earnings Preview: Who Joins Facebook On List Of Stocks Expecting 50%-Plus Growth?

194,UTX,"Stocks opened to modest declines, but quickly improved into mixed trade Wednesday, as global markets recovered and U.S. stocks felt for direction.XThe Dow Jones industrial average opened down 0.4%, but quickly reversed into a fractional gain. The Nasdaq Composite pared its opening loss to 0.3%, as Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) both fell more than 1%.  The S&P 500 eased its initial decline to less than 0.1%.Market volatility — as measured by the Cboe Market Volatility Index, commonly called the VIX — spiked Monday and then again Tuesday before pulling back and ending sharply lower. Volatility is not necessarily a negative, it just means both gains and losses can evaporate quickly, making the market more unpredictable than usual. In the current setting, premarket gains tell an investor little about where the market may end the day.Leading benchmarks across Asia were mixed Wednesday, with Tokyo's Nikkei 225 rebounding 0.2% while China's markets continued to carve deep losses. Trade in Europe gained strength in the afternoon session, with London's FTSE 100 up 1.1%, the DAX in Frankfurt trading 1% higher and the CAC-40 in Paris rising 0.8%.Commodities generally showed moderate losses as the dollar rose vs. the euro and notched further declines against the yen. Bonds edged up, trimming the 10-year yield two basis points to 2.78%.The economic calendar for Wednesday is light, showing only the Energy Information Administration's weekly oil inventories report at 10:30 a.m. ET, and the Federal Reserve's December Consumer Credit data due at 3 p.m. ET.Speaking in Frankfurt, Germany, early Wednesday, Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan described the U.S. market's recent volatility as a healthy correction, and contended that the recent acceleration in wage growth would not necessarily lead to a faster pace in the Fed's rate hike scheme.New York Federal Reserve Bank President William Dudley was scheduled to speak at 8:30 a.m. ET, and Charles Evans of the Chicago Fed was scheduled for comments at 11:15 a.m.Two-thirds of the Dow Jones names moved higher in the first 15 minutes of trade. Walt Disney (DIS) took the index's strongest opening gain, up more than 1% after its fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue cleared analyst targets by a wide mark. Revenue from the entertainment giant's media networks was flat during the quarter, but revenue from theme parks and resorts surged 13%.The stock closed Wednesday about 7% below a 113.29 buy point in a nine-month, cup-with-handle base.Disney's early gain was rapidly overtaken as United Technologies (UTX), General Electric (GE) and Boeing (BA) all advanced more than 1%.Snap (SNAP) scored a 29% opening gain. The Snapchat parent reported a 13-cent loss per share vs. views for a 16-cent loss. It also clobbered analyst targets on its revenue line and added 11 million daily active users during the fourth quarter — three million more than consensus forecasts.Snap shares have slogged along deep in an 11-month consolidation. The stock ended Tuesday 25% off an August low, and  17% below its March 2017 IPO price.Wynn Resorts (WYNN) bolted 8% higher after the company announced founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Steve Wynn would step down and be replaced immediately by board director Matthew Maddox, both at the Wynn Resorts parent and at its high-profit Wynn Macau unit in China. Wynn Macau's shares had dropped 17% following news reports of sexual misconduct by CEO Wynn.

195,UTX,"General Electric (GE) CFO Jeffrey Bornstein said Wednesday that some industries ""will sit on their hands waiting"" and not invest unless lawmakers deliver promised changes to taxes and regulations and provide more clarity on health care policy.The warning comes as House Republicans' corporate tax revamp is running into opposition in Congress, as more GOP lawmakers balk at a proposed import tax that's seen as a key piece of the overhaul. President Trump has yet to unveil his own tax plan. And while Trump also wants to repeal and replace ObamaCare, some Republicans have turned squeamish about sweeping changes to the health law.At the Barclays Industrial Select conference in Miami, Bornstein said he is ""reasonably confident"" that the changes will get passed in 2017, but said investors could be ""very disappointed"" if they aren't.""If we don't get corporate tax reform across the goal line in 2017,  if we don't provide some visibility to where health care is going in 2017, and if we don't deliver on all the regulatory changes the administration has talked about in 2017, I think we could end up in a very difficult place,"" he said.On Tuesday, GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt — along with CEOs from Boeing (BA), United Technologies (UTX) and other industrial exporters, as well as drugmakers Celgene (CELG), Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE) — wrote a letter urging congressional support for the House's tax reform blueprint, which includes a border adjustment tax.A total of 16 companies signed the letter, but more than 100 companies (including Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Nike (NKE)) and dozens of trade groups have signed on to Americans for Affordable Products, a group created to oppose the import tax.GE shares fell 0.6% to 30.33 on the stock market today. Boeing shares were off 0.1%. United Tech rose 0.1%.Last month, as talk of repealing ObamaCare began ramping up, GE's Immelt also indicated that some customers could become more cautious.""If I took it by segment, the Affordable Care Act is getting the most attention in the media and by our customers,"" he said on a conference call after reporting mixed Q4 results. ""I think you could see some caution around the Affordable Care Act as you go forward. We haven't really seen that much. But that could happen.""Trump said at a rally in Florida over the weekend that a replacement plan for ObamaCare won't be coming for ""a couple of weeks."" He warned earlier that the process could last until next year.Meanwhile, markets are still waiting for the White House to detail its own tax proposals, as those from congressional Republicans take more flak.Last week, Trump told retail CEOs that a ""massive"" tax plan will come ""in the not-too-distant future."" That followed his remarks to airline CEOs in the prior week, when he vowed to announce something ""phenomenal in terms of tax"" in the coming weeks.RELATED: If Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May CollapseTrump Silent On Ex-Im Bank, Hints At 'Big' Boeing Super Hornet Order

Dish Network (DISH) was a big gainer in the Nasdaq 100, up about 5% on news it's joining the S&P 500.Health care names were in focus in the stock market today after the Republicans submitted a revamped version of the Affordable Care Act Monday. But gains and losses were relatively mild in the sector. Drugmakers and hospital stocks lagged. Managed care firms like Dow component UnitedHealth (UNH) outperformed. Drugmakers were weak after President Trump tweeted again about his intent to get drug prices lower.Declining stocks outnumbered advancers on both exchanges by less than 2-to-1.In merger news, Sterling Bancorp (STL) slumped 4% and was testing support at the 50-day moving average on news it's acquiring Astoria Financial (AF) for $2.2 billion. Shares of Astoria soared 11%, breaking out of a flat base.Meanwhile, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) announced plans to buy Nimble Storage (NMBL) for just over $1 billion, valuing Nimble at 12.50 a share. Shares of HPE were mostly unchanged on the news, while Nimble soared 45%.Inside the IBD 50, Arista Networks (ANET) held up well, rising 2%. It continues to trade tightly near highs after a bullish move higher in the week ended Feb. 17.In earnings news, China-based Momo (MOMO) soared 11% to 29.45 after the social networking platform reported another quarter of huge growth, with profit up 633% from the year-ago quarter and sales up 524% to $246.1 million. Momo on Feb. 8 cleared a 23.96 handle buy point but formed an alternative entry at a 27.93 buy point.New issue Camping World (CWH) is near the top of a buy range from a 34.29 buy point ahead of its earnings report after the close. Sales growth has been decelerating in recent quarters at the retailer. Sales are expected to decelerate again in the current quarter, rising just 3% to $676.7 million.

197,UTX,"Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average and other major indexes were modestly above fair value early Wednesday after President Trump urged tax cuts, ObamaCare repeal and $1 trillion in infrastructure spending in a major speech before Congress.The Dow industrials fell 0.1% in Tuesday stock market trading, ending a 12-day win streak, the longest since 1987, ahead of Trump's speech and as Federal Reserve policymakers signaled a March rate hike was likely. The S&P 500 index sank 0.3%, the Nasdaq composite 0.6% and the small-cap Russell 2000 1.5%.Futures for the Dow industrials. S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 rose about 0.2% vs. fair value.That's despite late selling in Salesforce.com (CRM), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Ambarella (AMBA), Ross Stores (ROST) and Veeva (VEEV). Palo Alto Networks dived on very weak guidance, while Salesforce, Amabarella, Veeva and Ross Stores also retreated on guidance.Meanwhile, Snap (SNAP) is gearing up to price its big IPO late Wednesday. The Snapchat parent is attracting heavy demand, raising speculation that the photo-sharing app could be valued at $25 billion.Trump reiterated major policy themes, not providing much detail for investors.""My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone,"" Trump said. But he didn't specifically mention, let alone endorse, a border-adjusted tax that is a key plant of a House GOP corporate tax reform plan. Trump also vowed ""massive tax relief for the middle class.""Six Dow components, including General Electric (GE), Boeing (BA) and United Technologies (UTX) have backed a border-adjustment tax. Retailers and apparel firms, including Dow stocks Wal-Mart (WMT) and Nike (NKE) are strongly opposed, while Dow automaker General Motors CEO Mary Barra said Tuesday that a border tax would be ""problematic.""Trump also said he would push for $1 trillion in infrastructure spending, via public and private sources. That seems to measure up to his Monday pledge for ""big"" infrastructure boosts, but he didn't spell out the timing of any such initiative. With tax reform and ObamaCare among the other big issues facing his administration and Congress, a report last week said infrastructure may be pushed back to 2018.Steel, concrete, construction and other infrastructure firms were big winners after Trump's election, but they've swung up and down in recent weeks as investors try to figure out what will actually occur, and when.In Asian trading Wednesday, Japan's Nikkei index rose 1.4% as the yen on bets that the Fed will raise rates.China's Shanghai composite advanced 0.3%. China's official manufacturing index rose 0.3 point in February to 51.6, a three-month high and signaling slightly faster growth. Readings over 50 suggest expansion.Futures pointed to modest gains at the open in the U.K., France and Germany.RELATED:

198,UTX,"Steel maker Nucor (NUE) is tentatively moving forward with plans for an automotive steel plant in Mexico as it awaits clarity on President Trump's promised tax cuts and threatened border taxes.""We still expect it to be in Mexico, but we'll watch that,"" Nucor CEO John Ferriola told analysts on Jan. 30 about the $270 million plant that his firm is scheduled to break ground on this summer with its joint-venture partner, Japanese steel maker JFE Holding. ""When and if something changes and we have some definitive direction that says that's not the place to put it, we do have options and we will work and will follow with one of those options.""Similarly, BMW and Toyota (TM) have said they'll follow through on plans for new factories in Mexico, and General Motors (GM) has said it won't alter its production plans despite getting heat from a Trump tweet over some of its Cruze hatchbacks being built south of the border. (Ford Motor (F) did cancel plans to build a Mexico plant, but that appears to reflect declining U.S. demand for small cars rather than Ford bending to Trump's will.)Chipmaker CTS Corp. (CTS) told analysts on Tuesday that it is on track to shift production from Elkhart, Ind., where about 230 workers are employed, to other ""best cost"" locations outside the U.S. by 2018.Other companies sticking to their plans include Caterpillar (CAT), which is shifting some jobs from Joliet, Ill., to Mexico, and Rexnord (RXN), which is closing an Indiana ball-bearings facility that employs 350 and shifting production to Mexico, according to a Wall Street Journal report.Trump, with the help of some tax incentives from Indiana, did manage to convince United Technologies (UTX) to keep open a Carrier air-conditioning plant slated for closure, saving about 800 of nearly 2,000 jobs that appeared to be headed to Mexico. But concerns over jeopardizing valuable defense contracts may have made United Tech especially open to a face-saving deal.The broader point is that Trump's plans to grow U.S. manufacturing employment look unlikely to gain traction while so much uncertainty remains about the tax carrots and sticks he wants to use to shift corporate incentives. The bully pulpit, by itself, can't accomplish much.IBD'S TAKE: The controversial GOP border-tax plan may be the only way President Trump can deliver a big corporate tax cut.It's not surprising that companies would move ahead with plans hatched prior to Trump's election. Yet there's risk that a drawn-out debate over tax reform, including a debate over the House proposal for a 20% border tax, could freeze future investment plans as companies wait for clarity.If questions grow over whether Trump can deliver on his promised corporate tax cut, the burst of economic enthusiasm now showing up in the Institute of Supply Management gauge of factory activity and other sentiment gauges could turn into a letdown.Even as the Dow Jones industrial average is holding above 20,000, the rise in gold prices to nearly a three-month high and the drop in the 10-year Treasury yield close to a two-month low are signs that big investors are hedging their bets over what Trump will be able to accomplish.RELATED:Why Tax Reform Could End In Tears For Trump And GOPTreasury Might Write Checks To Boeing Under GOP Tax Reform

199,UTX,"CEOs of Dow stocks General Electric (GE), Boeing (BA) and 14 other big U.S. exporters are warning that unless Republicans embrace a controversial tax on imports, a once-in-a-generation chance at tax reform will fail and American workers would be the losers.""Our tax code penalizes American workers who make products or provide services sold abroad, while favoring their international competitors,"" the CEOs wrote in a letter to leaders of both parties in Congress.Among other companies whose CEOs co-signed the letter were Caterpillar (CAT), Dow Chemical (DOW), Raytheon (RTN), United Technologies (UTX), Oracle (ORCL) and some of the biggest drug and biotech companies: Celgene (CELG), Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE).Caterpillar, Merck, Pfizer and United Technologies also are members of the Dow Jones industrial average, in addition to General Electric and Boeing.The letter puts some of the largest U.S. companies squarely behind House Speaker Paul Ryan and other House GOP leaders, who argue that leveling the international playing field by cutting the U.S. corporate tax rate to 20% (or lower) will be impossible without their plan for a 20% tax on imports, which would raise $1 trillion over a decade.Yet the biggest surprise about the letter may be just how few companies signed it, while more than 100 companies, including Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT), Nike (NKE) and the American subsidiary of Toyota (TM), and dozens of trade groups have signed onto the Americans for Affordable Products, created to oppose the House border tax proposal. (Wal-Mart and Nike are also Dow industrials stocks.)Retail stocks were under pressure from early December, as prospects for a border tax were on the rise, but they've made a modest recovery lately as prospects faded. On Tuesday, perhaps helped more by Wal-Mart's positive earnings report as well-received Macy's (M) earnings than weighed down by a revved-up lobbying campaign for the tax, retail shares were on rise. Wal-Mart rose 3% to close at 71.45 on the stock market today, while Target added 0.6%.IBD'S TAKE: Supporters of the border tax plan say that the dollar would rise by 20% vs. other currencies, meaning that it wouldn't harm either corporate profits or consumers. But it does pose a risk to U.S. investors holding shares of companies like Alibaba or international ETFs.Under the House proposal for a border-adjusted tax, U.S. companies would pay a 20% tax rate on the full value of imported goods, while export revenue would be tax-free. The border tax would raise more than $1 trillion over a decade to offset the cost of lowering the 35% statutory tax rate to 20%, the conservative Tax Foundation has said.Without the border tax, the ability of Congress to reduce the U.S. corporate tax rate will be limited to ""incremental tweaks (that) will not level the playing field for American workers or dramatically reinvigorate economic growth,"" the CEO letter said.It's not clear precisely why so few companies came out in favor of the border tax. Although the proposal seems to be running into a buzz saw among Republicans in the Senate, it's possible that the letter wasn't widely circulated. However, Caroline Freund, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, has predicted that ""many more big lobbies will be against the BAT (border-adjusted tax) than in favor."" That's because the tax favors labor-intensive industries that export more than they import, with aerospace being a rare example.There's one nagging question about why companies such as GE and Boeing that are so dependent upon exports would back the border tax. Most trade experts who have looked at the tax have big doubts that it would comply with World Trade Organization rules, so it could lead the U.S. into a trade war. Given that uncertainty and the possible consequences, it's hard to understand why companies so dependent upon trade would support the border tax, yet that may partly explain why the list of supporters is so small.RELATED:If Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May Collapse GOP Border-Tax Plan Would Sock U.S. Tourism — Including Trump Hotels

Seoul already has one of the 14,300-ton, 653-foot ships and a second is scheduled for deployment in 2020, according to Military.com.Meanwhile, Japan is mulling the F-35B for use on its helicopter carriers as it looks to defend its smaller islands against China's growing maritime presence, government sources told The Japan Times.The U.S. Marines approved the F-35B for combat in 2015, and a squadron is deployed in Japan.

South Korea has ordered 40 F-35As and earlier this month announced plans to buy 20 more, while Japan has ordered 42 F-35As.Interest in additional stealth fighters comes as North Korea has made rapid progress on its nuclear and missile programs.Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., said last month that it's possible for the F-35 to shoot down nuclear missiles from North Korea or Iran with its Raytheon (RTN) AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles just seconds after takeoff.Boeing's (BA) F-15 could also be used if it had the right sensors but the stealthy fifth-generation F-35 already has key sensors installed, Aviation Week noted in a report earlier this month.In particular, Northrop has developed the F-35's infrared AN/AAQ-37 sensors that serve as an aircraft and missile warning system and the jet's fire control radar. The company has been testing the sensors on ballistic missiles for several years, according to the report.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Boeing, Lockheed, Defense Giants Eye 2018 Deals That Could Reshape SectorDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsPentagon's No. 2 Has This Confusing 'Mindset' On Lockheed's F-35
"
203,UTX,"WASHINGTON — Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan wants the ""mindset"" that the Pentagon's costliest weapons program ever, Lockkheed Martin's (LMT) F-35, is churning out stealth fighters at full tilt — even though it's nowhere near that level.X His remarks contrast with the typically careful language from other program officials, who have been very deliberate about their choice of words to be as transparent as possible in describing each step in the controversial $400 billion program, which has been blasted for being over-budget and behind schedule.This year, Lockheed delivered 66 F-35s, and will start production and delivery of 90 jets in 2018, as low-rate production ramps up. Lockheed expects to hit-full rate production of 160 jets per year by 2023.But at a press briefing Thursday, Shanahan said Lockheed has reached full-rate production:""How do we really leverage up on the performance there? They've gone now from a development status to full-rate production. So since we've got this steady state of full-rate production how do you make that, you know, run like a sewing machine?""Lockheed shares closed down 0.2% at flat at 317.19 on the stock market today. Northrop Grumman (NOC), a top F-35 subcontractor, dipped 0.7%. United Technologies (UTX), which makes the F-35's engines, rose 0.2%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Lockheed has been gearing up for full-rate production at its factory in Fort Worth, Texas, and hiring more workers. But acquisition rules require full combat testing certification, or Initial Operational Test and Evaluation, before the F-35 can advance to the full-rate phase.Shanahan is no stranger to the specific terminology used by Pentagon's acquisition programs as he was Boeing's (BA) senior vice president for supply chain and operations until his appointment to the Pentagon's No. 2 spot in July.When pressed about his choice of words by reporters, Shanahan acknowledged he wasn't technically correct. But in his mind, the program is already at full-rate production and that if it waited until 2020 to ""start behaving differently, I think we've missed an opportunity.""""We should be thinking about the mindset and behaviors and how we are leveraging productivity of a full-rate environment,"" he added, saying he doesn't think Lockheed has a long way to go with its production ramp-up.The company said in a statement that Shanahan recently toured Fort Worth production line and is on track to meet increasing production rates as well as support Initial Operational Test and Evaluation next year.The Pentagon's F-35 joint program office said in a statement that the the program is ""moving at a full sprint,"" noting that ""over the next five years"" the F-35 will see the largest growth across its development, production and sustainment efforts.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Hypersonic Weapons: The Biggest Warfighting Disrupter Since Stealth Is ComingDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

204,UTX,"The International Trade Commission is expected to weigh in Friday on Boeing's (BA) trade dispute with Bombardier, as reports point to a likely win for the U.S. aerospace giant.X The ITC will decide on whether to approve the Commerce Department's recommendation to hit the Canadian company's C Series jet with a near-300% duty on sales to American carriers.Boeing has claimed Bombardier was able to sell the aircraft at ""absurdly low prices"" in the U.S. after receiving $3 billion in government subsidies. Bombardier has said Boeing's case has no merit and that its actual intent is to force Bombardier out of the 100-seat market as it looks to acquire a competing maker of small jets.Despite this, a Canadian government source told Reuters Thursday that Bombardier is likely to lose the case, saying ""It is not a multilateral or independent or unbiased tribunal. It's an American tribunal.""Shares of Boeing rallied 2.5% Thursday to close at 343.11. U.S.-listed shares of Airbus (EADSY), which has taken a majority stake in the C Series line, fell 3%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.The dispute began in April last year after Boeing complained about a Delta Air Lines (DAL) order for 75 C Series jets.Boeing has claimed Bombardier sold each 108-133-seat  CS100 for just $19.6 million, arguing they actually cost $33.2 million to make.In September, the Commerce Department proposed a tariff of 219.6% on the Canadian jets, then added an additional 79.8% tariff the following month.In response, Bombardier struck a deal with Boeing's rival Airbus, which saw the European firm take a 50.1% stake in the C Series line for no cash outlay. The aviation giant also plans to open an assembly line in Alabama to build C Series planes for the U.S. market. Bombardier says that will create more than 2,000 permanent U.S. jobs.The trade dispute has spilled over to Boeing's customers.In December, Delta Air Lines snubbed Boeing by placing a massive midsize jet order with Airbus. The airline had been in talks with Boeing about buying around 100 of its 737 Max 10 jets, but opted instead to buy 100 A321neos, worth $12.7 billion at list prices, though airlines typically get steep discounts for major deals.The ruling could also affect sales of Boeing military hardware in the U.K., as 4,200 Bombardier jobs in Northern Ireland could be at risk over the decision.""This is not the behavior we expect from Boeing and it could indeed jeopardize our future relationship with them,"" British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon said last year. The U.K. has a Boeing P-8 maritime surveillance plane on order, along with a fleet of new Apache attack helicopters.In addition, British Prime Minister Theresa May said that she was ""bitterly disappointed"" by the decision to impose tariffs after she had personally asked for President Trump's help in the dispute.Canadian officials also threatened to cancel a planned purchase of 18 Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet jets due to the decision, with officials claiming the C Series supported 23,000 jobs in the U.S. and that the jet's engine is made by United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney unit.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsAirline Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

205,UTX,"United Technologies (UTX) predicted Wednesday its Pratt & Whitney unit will ramp up deliveries of its latest jet engine this year, as production problems come under control.Delays with the new geared turbofan prompted Qatar Airways to cancel an order last year for Airbus (EADSY) A320neo jets.United Tech earlier had cut its 2016 forecast for turbofan deliveries to 150 from 200. On Wednesday, the company said it sees 2017 deliveries of 350-400, including about 50 spares.The industrial conglomerate also reported fourth-quarter earnings rose 13.9% to $1.56 a share, in line with Wall Street forecasts, as revenue rose 2.5% to $14.66 billion, missing views for $14.7 billion.Sales at Pratt & Whitney rose nearly 4% to $3.99 billion. Sales at its Otis elevator unit dipped 1% to $3.06 billion. Sales at the climate, control and security business rose 3% to $4.25 billion. Aerospace systems sales grew 4% to $3.6 billion.The company also backed its full-year 2017 EPS view of $6.30-$6.60, with the midpoint below consensus for $6.56, on revenue of $57.5 billion-$59 billion,  also light vs. Wall Street views for $58.86 billion.United Tech said it plans to buy back $3.5 billion in shares this year and is setting aside $1 billion-$2 billion for acquisitions.""Despite an uncertain global macro environment, our growing aerospace backlog and strategic investments in the commercial businesses position us well to generate higher organic growth in 2017,"" Chief Executive Officer Gregory Hayes said in a statement.Shares fell 0.6% to 110.95 on the stock market today, staying in buy range and finding support at their 50-day line after undercutting both key points intraday.In the latter part of last year, other industrials, like Dover (DOV), Honeywell (HON) and PPG Industries (PPG), gave dim forecasts about the months to come.Last week, General Electric (GE) reported fourth-quarter results that offered up more of the same: slow growth globally, volatility, an oversupplied oil & gas sector that has less need for GE's oil-related equipment. GE, however, said it remained more upbeat heading into this year.When asked about how potential regulatory changes under the new administration might affect its businesses, CEO Jeff Immelt said they ""could see some caution"" over the Affordable Care Act, which the GOP has been eager to dismantle, from customers who buy medical equipment from its health care division.GE shares were up 1.2% Wednesday.RELATED:Trump Claims Twitter Win On Indiana Jobs; Carrier Stresses State IncentivesTrump Touts Carrier Deal, Says Companies Leaving U.S. Face 'Consequences'United Technologies, Costco Upgraded; Shale Producers Mixed

206,UTX,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) expects a surge in F-35 deliveries this year but gave weak earnings guidance as the defense giant comes under intense pressure from the White House to cut costs on the massive program.The Pentagon's top contractor expects to deliver 66 of the stealth jets in 2017, up 43% from the 46 delivered last year, though that fell short of its goal for 53.But Lockheed sees 2017 EPS of $12.25-$12.55, below consensus views for $12.87, on revenue of $49.4 billion-$50.6 billion, with the midpoint above the Wall Street estimate of $49.59 billion.The $400 billion F-35 program is becoming an increasing critical part of Lockheed's business as production, and deliveries, ramp up. In 2015, the company delivered 45, up from 36 in 2014.Lockheed shares closed down 1.8% at 252.91 on the stock market today, halving earlier losses. United Technologies (UTX), which makes the F-35's engines, rose 1.15%, and Northrop Grumman (NOC), a major F-35 subcontractor, added 0.4%.IBD'S TAKE: President Donald Trump is seen as risky for the aerospace industry as Hillary Clinton was to drug manufacturers, according to a report from Citron Research.In Q4, Lockheed's aeronautics revenue, which includes F-35 sales, jumped 23% to $5.41 billion. That helped lift total Q4 sales 19% to $13.75 billion, better than views for $13.03 billion.Missiles and fire control revenue fell 10.8% to $1.76 billion. Rotary and mission systems revenue jumped 36.8% to $3.81 billion, helped by the Sikorsky acquisition. Space systems revenue climbed 16.7% to $2.78 billion.Adjusted EPS climbed 24% to $3.25, easily topping forecasts for $3.05.President Donald Trump has complained about the $400 billion F-35 program's costs and suggested it could face competition from Boeing's (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornet.But earlier this month Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson assured Trump that an upcoming contract for the next batch of F-35 fighters will create 1,800 jobs in Texas and thousands more across U.S. suppliers.Lockheed said it was near a deal for 90 additional F-35s that will ""significantly"" reduce the cost of the fighter.Hewson, along with other manufacturing company executives, met Monday with Trump, who vowed to slash income taxes and regulations and said companies that send operations aboard will get slapped with a border tax on items coming back to the U.S.Boeing also has come under fire from Trump over the costs of its new Air Force One program.

209,UTX,"General Electric (GE) is reportedly inching toward its first major portfolio shake-up under new CEO John Flannery — a potential sale of its industrial-solutions unit in a deal valued at $2.5 billion-$3 billion.XGE and fellow industrial conglomerate ABB (ABB) are likely to announce the pact next week, capping a multimonth search for a suitor that began in December, sources told Bloomberg. The sale's proceeds are expected to fund restructuring initiatives at GE.Both companies declined to confirm the report.GE's industrial-solutions business makes products such as uninterrupted power supply systems for backup power and voltage regulators. It is one of the smaller GE divisions and the move to jettison it is part of a broader reorganization of GE Energy Connections & Lighting, the company's least-profitable unit last year with margins of 2.1%, Bloomberg said. GE's iconic lighting unit is also up for grabs.Meanwhile, Swiss engineering firm ABB is one of the largest in the world and is trying to strengthen its portfolio, after recent restructuring.Shares of GE were up 0.5% at 24.87 on the stock market today, but hit resistance at their 50-day average, a key marker of institutional support, and carry an IBD RS Rating of just 12. ABB rose 0.45% to 24.74, continuing to form a flat base with a 25.93 buy point.IBD'S TAKE: Market-leading stocks usually boast an RS Rating of 80 or higher.

214,UTX,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) and the Pentagon confirmed a deal Friday for the 10th production batch of F-35 fighters, for $8.2 billion.The contract covers 90 aircraft: 76 of the F-35A variant with a unit cost is $94.6 million, a 7.3% reduction from the ninth batch; 12 of the F-35B short-takeoff-vertical-landing variant with a unit cost of $122.8 million, a 6.7% reduction; and two of the F-35C carrier-launched variant with a unit cost of $121.8 million, a 7.9% reduction.The Pentagon's joint program office said the total cost is $8.2 billion. A Lockheed spokesperson originally said the deal was worth $8.5 billion, then referred questions to the program office. The JPO, in a late Friday clarification to IBD, said that the $8.2 billion figure doesn't include jet engines covered under a separate deal with Pratt & Whitney, a United Technologies (UTX) unit.Lockheed Martin shares rose 1% to 254.46 in Friday stock market trading.  Lockheed is finding resistance at the 50-day line.Originally lots 9 and 10 were to be negotiated together, but the Defense Department finalized the deal for lot 9 in November for 57 jets at a cost of $6.1 billion, in what Lockheed called a ""unilateral contract action"" that wasn't mutually agreed upon.The Pentagon said Lot 10 represents a $728 million total reduction vs. Lot 9, if compared against a 90-jet order with unit price tags seen in Lot 9.Last week, Trump claimed that he helped cut $600 million off lot 10 after his meeting with Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson.""There was no movement and I was able to get $600 million approximately off those planes. So I think that was a great achievement.""However, it's not clear that Trump did really achieve anything, as the Pentagon had already mentioned the cost savings before Trump became involved, the Washington Post previously reported.On Dec. 19, Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, the Defense Department's F-35 program manager, said that the Pentagon plans to negotiate prices for the 10th lot of F-35s, with the cost for each variant seen coming down 6% to 7%, which comes to cost savings of between $550 million to $630 million.A Lockheed statement Friday said Trump's involvement ""accelerated the negotiations and sharpened our focus"" on reducing the price.Trump has been critical of the costs for the $400 billion F-35 program and suggested that it could face competition from the Boeing (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornet.Last week Defense Secretary James Mattis ordered a review of the F-35 program's costs.Boeing shares edged up 0.1%.RELATED: Lockheed Sees 2017 Jump In F-35s But Guides Profit Low Amid Cost Flap

And some on the Street may have been concerned about sales in the company's reliable power segment.Organic revenue and orders, two much-watched figures, fell 1% and 3%, respectively. Oil and gas revenue and transportation revenue — which respectively sank 22% and 23% in Q4 — have weighed on the industrial giant's results due weaker commodity demand.""It's largely a repeat of what we heard in the previous several quarters in 2016,"" Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau said.Earnings per share fell 12% to 46 cents, matching estimates. Revenue slipped 2% to $33.1 billion, missing forecasts for $33.63 billion. GE backed its 2017 organic growth target of 3%-5%.Aviation revenue rose 7%, as air carriers update their fleets with planes containing GE's engines. Renewable energy revenue jumped 29%. Healthcare revenue increased 3%. Power systems revenue rose 20%.""I think there's some concern more in that power business that sales were weaker than expected,"" Windau said. ""Some of those orders or shipments got pushed out into 2017.""GE this week said it secured more than $1.4 billion in orders from the Iraqi government to develop power plants.Shares fell 2.2% to 30.53 on the stock market today, dropping below their 200-day line and slipping further below a buy point of 31.59 after breaking out last month.General Electric in recent years has tried to focus more on its industrial roots — and become more of a tech company. GE's oil and gas unit will merge with oilfield services provider Baker Hughes (BHI) this year.Baker Hughes edged up 2 cents to 61.98. Rival Schlumberger (SLB), which also reported results Friday, fell 0.8%, and Halliburton (HAL) climbed 2% ahead of its report Monday.IBD'S TAKE: General Electric has attempted to turn more into a tech company, with a big, long-term focus on the so-called Industrial Internet. GE, like other industrials, had warned of a slow-growth environment due to the rout in commodity prices and a sluggish global economy. Several big industrial companies will follow GE's report next week.United Technologies (UTX) reports Q4 results early Wednesday: EPS up 14% to $1.56 with revenue essentially flat at $14.7 billion. Caterpillar (CAT) reports early Thursday: EPS down 11% to 66 cents as revenue slides 10.8% to $9.84 billion. Honeywell (HON) reports early next Friday: EPS up 10% to $1.74 with revenue up 1.7% to $10.15 billion.Some analysts say investors could be focused more on how GE and other industrials might do in the second half of this year and beyond, when oil and commodity prices may rebound more strongly and policies under the incoming Trump administration become more concrete.""These things, from an economic perspective, are taking time to work their way through the system,"" Windau said.RELATED:General Electric Stock Near Buy Zone Ahead Of Q4 Report

216,UTX,"Donald Trump won the Rust Belt and White House with help from his threats to slap tariffs on Chinese imports and goods shipped across the border from Mexico.Whether he'd make good on those threats became almost an afterthought as his promised tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation drove stocks higher after the election.But with the president-elect taking to the bully pulpit — like his Twitter posts threatening a ""border tax"" on Toyota (TM) and General Motors (GM) — the questions are bubbling to the surface, especially as his Jan. 20 inauguration nears.What kind of protectionist measures can he get away with, for good or bad?  Presidents have sweeping powers on trade, though Trump would need congressional approval for some actions.IBD'S TAKE: The House GOP tax reform that Trump is considering would likely help foreigners holding U.S. stocks and hit U.S. investors in foreign investments, such as Alibaba's ADRs or overseas ETFs.Trump's bully pulpit might never again be as effective as it is now, when no one knows what he will try to do to shrink America's trade deficit and revive factory employment.Here are six cards in Trump's hand that he could play.Trump has threatened to walk away from the controversial 1993 agreement that paved the way for zeroing out tariffs in the North America region. Mexico and Canada have said they are more than willing to come to the bargaining table.Legally, if not economically, exiting Nafta would be straightforward. The agreement includes an escape hatch after six months' notice, which Trump can deliver without an act of Congress. Further, the legislation approving Nafta allowed not only for a reversion to pre-1994 tariffs if the U.S. rips up the agreement, but gave the president authority to apply additional tit-for-tat duties to offset moves by Mexico (or Canada) that tilt the terms of trade.The threat of exiting Nafta could get Mexico and Canada to offer concessions, but not likely of the sweeping nature that Trump's tweets would seem to demand.Will Trump Play This Card? It's a safe bet that Trump will open up Nafta for talks. Actually scrapping the free-trade deal would be a much bigger deal.The Obama administration slapped a 35% tariff on Chinese tires in 2009, citing a surge in imports. It also imposed hefty tariffs on imports of cold-rolled flat steel after the U.S. International Trade Commission found that China was dumping steel in America at artificially low prices. The U.S. also slapped huge anti-dumping duties on Chinese solar-panel makers in 2014.The U.S. on Thursday formally accused China in a WTO complaint of illegally subsidizing its aluminum industry. It was the 16th WTO complaint vs. China during the Obama administration.Trump could take action to support individual industries by enforcing trade rules, not throwing out the rule book.  Such actions could benefit domestic competitors to affected Chinese goods, such as steel makers. The Trump administration will have several officials with steel industry ties. Industries that use the affected products  — such as automakers in the case of steel and aluminum — would pay higher prices that they would likely pass on to consumers.Will Trump Play This Card? Yes. Presidents Bush and Obama used anti-dumping duties and similar actions, especially vs. China. Trump will likely use this tool even more. Expect Trump to make more of such modest, specific actions than Obama.Trump vowed during the campaign that his Treasury Department would declare within his first 100 days that China is engaging in currency manipulation. If that happens, the Trump administration would, under U.S. law, impose even higher punitive duties than at present on Chinese products that are being dumped in the U.S.Trump has long accused China of artificially depressing the value of its currency to gain a trade advantage. Yet U.S. criteria for labeling a country a currency manipulator include ""persistent one-sided intervention in the foreign exchange market."" China has intervened heavily over the past year to curb its currency's slide and stop an exodus of capital from the country. The interventions cast doubt on whether the designation should apply.Will Trump Play This Card? Trump likely won't declare China a currency manipulator, if only because he can impose specific or sweeping protectionist steps without it.Even without a ""currency manipulator"" label, no U.S. law would constrain Trump from imposing his threatened 45% tariff on imports from China. ""A president who wants to restrict trade enjoys almost carte blanche authority,"" largely because Congress has ceded its constitutional authority over trade, wrote Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.The Trade Act of 1974 gives the president broad latitude to impose tariffs or other restrictions if the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative determines another country's trade practices are discriminatory or unreasonable. Several other laws give the president authority to impose unlimited trade restrictions by invoking an international economic emergency or national-security need.A sweeping tariff on Chinese imports would substantially raise the cost of computers, TVs and other electronics for U.S. consumers, including the Apple (AAPL) iPhone. Trump has said he wants Apple to build a massive U.S. plant.But China, which recently imposed a price-fixing fine on GM's local joint venture, has signaled it would retaliate. It could cancel Boeing (BA) jet orders, impede Apple iPhone sales as well as conduct new probes and investigations on U.S. multinational giants that get a large and growing share of revenue in China.On Monday, China President Xi Jinping told the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday: ""Protectionism is like locking yourself in a dark room, which would seem to escape wind and rain, but also block out the sunshine. No one is a winner in a trade war.""Will Trump Play This Card? A big, broad tariff or tax on Chinese or Mexican goods could be highly disruptive to American business and raise prices in an obvious way for consumers. So it's probably unlikely.Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on a growing list of companies whenever it has emerged that one of them appears to be building production capacity in Mexico, potentially at the expense of their U.S. workers.The one thing Trump can't do under U.S. law is target the imports of individual companies. Trump's threat, for example, to impose a border tax on Chevrolet Cruze hatchbacks shipped from Mexico would be discriminatory if it applied only to GM.Trump would have the power to impose a tariff on, say, all small cars imported from Mexico. But it's unlikely Mexico would agree to substantial tariffs as part of a renegotiation of Nafta, so such a move would likely require Trump to walk away from the deal.Yet why tax assembled vehicles and not parts? According to the Cars.com American-Made Index, just eight car models sold in the U.S. consist of at least 75% domestically sourced parts, down from about 30 in 2010.What is more, Trump hasn't only threatened tariffs on Mexican-made cars, but on United Technologies (UTX) Carrier air conditioners and Rexnord (RXN) ball bearings if they closed plants in Indiana. United Technologies' Carrier in November agreed to keep one of two plants open in exchange for some state tax breaks.Applying a tax only on imports of a company that shifts jobs overseas would require hard-to-pass legislation, would be difficult to administer and would provide an advantage to producers that already are based overseas.Increasingly, Trump's threats seem to imply that he wants a broad-based tax on manufactured goods made in Mexico that are shipped to the U.S. But there would be risks in targeting America's southern neighbor.Mexico's goods trade surplus with the U.S. equaled $58 billion in 2015, or close to 5% of GDP, while total goods shipped to the U.S. equaled close to one-fourth of GDP. A tax that made producing in Mexico for U.S. customers uneconomical could send that country into a depression. If the tax were high enough, it could shift production to the U.S., but either way, costs for U.S. customers would rise.And just as made-in-the-U.S.A. cars and trucks have many foreign parts, many Mexican-made products also have substantial components made by American workers.Will Trump Play This Card? Trump may be tempted to impose tariffs on some or all Mexican autos, but because he can't single out specific companies, such an action would be highly disruptive and unlikely to score easy political wins.Trump has one last card in his hand, and it's the one that pro-trade Republicans like House Speaker Paul Ryan want him to play. The chief idea is to get rid of one stick that discourages companies from producing their products in the U.S.: the tax code.The principal option is the House Republican plan that would finance a big cut in the corporate tax rate (from 35% to 20%) with a 20% tax applied to imports.The conservative Tax Foundation says that the provision would raise $1.1 trillion over 10 years.Trump's campaign plan called for a 15% corporate rate but didn't identify ways to pay for it.Strategists at Citigroup have said they thought it was likely that Trump will embrace the House plan.But Trump says that a border adjustment plan is ""too complicated,"" he told the Wall Street Journal in a Friday interview.Goldman Sachs had given it just a 1-in-3 chance because the retail industry is bracing for a bitter fight against what they've dubbed a ""consumer tax."" Retailers import vast amounts of apparel, electronics and other consumer goods.The potential attraction of the House plan to Trump is that it taxes imports but not exports, in a reversal of current policy that imposes corporate income taxes on exporters but not overseas producers with goods bound for the U.S. Proponents go so far as to suggest that this is a neat way for Trump to shift the tide of trade without provoking a trade war.The likely reality is fuzzier. If the U.S. starts running a lower trade deficit due to a border tax, the value of the dollar would rise relative to other currencies, negating the advantage gained. Under the House plan, Deutsche Bank figures that the dollar would appreciate by 15%, largely offsetting the tax changes.Not even supporters of the House tax plan are sure that it will comply with WTO rules.Ex-Treasury Secretary Larry Summers told CNBC, ""We'll set off a wave of reaction from the rest of the world that will see this as protectionist plan."" If the dollar spikes, it could cause debt crises in some emerging markets, Summers warns. If it doesn't, it could crush retailers and increase inequality, since those taxes would be passed on to consumers.Will Trump Play This Card? GOP lawmakers are likely to adopt this tax reform, and Trump could still back it. But with narrow majorities in Congress and stiff opposition from retailers, it's unclear if the measure would pass.RELATED:Trump Trade, Tax Talk Hits Dollar As Mexico Warns On Tariffs

217,UTX,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson said Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 has capabilities that are ""on a completely different level"" than Boeing's (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornet, which President-elect Donald Trump has suggested may compete against the more advanced stealth jet.In a ""Defense One"" sponsored event Tuesday, Richardson said the Super Hornet, which is considered a 4th-generation fighter, could be upgraded to a 4.5-generation fighter and noted that the Navy's carrier air wing will consist of 5th- and 4th-generation fighters ""in the foreseeable future.""""We need the F-35s,"" he said. ""That is our 5th-gen capability which we need, supplemented by healthy cadre of advanced Super Hornets.""Addressing Trump's complaints about the F-35's costs and his vow to lower them, Richardson added, ""We need that capability, and we need to get it at the very best price for the taxpayer.""Shares of Lockheed were down 0.2% to 254.12 at the close on the stock market today. Northrop Grumman (NOC), a major subcontractor on the F-35, was off 0.7% to 228.48, and United Technologies (UTX), whose Pratt & Whitney unit makes the engines, slipped 0.2% to 109.97. Boeing dipped 0.7% to 157.67.Amid expectations for a bigger shipbuilding budget, Richardson said the Navy would prioritize resources on ships that are being built now, such as destroyers, attack submarines and amphibious warfare ships.""The industrial base is ready to respond"" to the call for more ships, Richardson said.Shares of shipbuilder General Dynamics (GD) lost 1.1% to close at 175.97 while rival Huntington Ingalls (HII) fell 1% to 189.61.RELATED: Lockheed Notes F-35 Jobs From Production Hike As Trump Blasts CostsAir Force Lays Out Big, Early Decisions For Trump's Administration

219,UTX,"Major indexes traded mixed in late afternoon trading Thursday, but remained in good shape overall.XMeanwhile, Square (SQ) showed a solid breakout from a second-stage base with a 28.07 entry. The electronic payments facilitator rose more than 4% to 28.77 and is still in buy range.As noted in IBD's premium stock-picking service, Leaderboard, the stock is in buy range. Don't buy shares more than 5% past the proper entry, or in this case 29.47.At 3:45 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite was off nearly 0.5% but remains up for the week with a 1.1% weekly gain. Plus, the Nasdaq's intraday range is narrow, suggesting that large players in the market — from mutual funds and hedge funds to banks, insurers and pension managers — are reluctant to sell with vigor.The S&P 500 was off just 0.1% and is within arm's length of its recent new all-time high of 2498. The S&P SmallCap 600 was down nearly 0.2%.Only a handful of IBD's 197 industry groups are up 1% or more; they include the solar, automaker, water utility, hospital, leisure product and semiconductor equipment names. Applied Materials (AMAT) is leading the chip gear names with a 2% gain to 47.19 in slightly above-average turnover.Watch for a potential breakout by the tech giant past a 47.96 base entry. Aggressive traders could act if the stock breaches the 47.59 near-term high.There doesn't seem to be too much hoopla about the possibility of the S&P 500 breaking the 2500 barrier. In fact, as seen in IBD's Psychological Market Indicators section, bullishness among stock newsletter editors tracked by Investors Intelligence has actually fallen to 47.1%, the lowest since the aftermath of the Nov. 8 U.S. elections.Meanwhile, the put-call volume ratio recently notched a high of 1.18 on Aug. 17, meaning that among options traders, pessimism is still rampant. And that's good for equities. Why? Pessimistic investors have generally sold stocks and raised cash, thinking that equities are due to fall. But if they don't, these pessimists could potentially become new buyers of stocks.The Dow Jones industrial average rose nearly 0.2% as four of the 30 components, including United Technologies (UTX), 3M (MMM) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), rose 1 point or more.United Tech is trying to reclaim its key long-term support level, the 200-day moving average, which is near 116. Meanwhile, the 50-day moving average is now trending lower. The manufacturer of aircraft engines, elevators and security systems triggered a sell signal for short-term investors when shares pierced the 50-day moving average near 122 during a high-volume sell-off on July 25.On that day, United Tech reported a 2% jump in Q2 profit to $1.85 a share. Earnings growth has been stuck in the low- to mid-single digits for four straight quarters, unlike the bigger EPS increases seen among members of IBD Big Cap 20, IBD's screen for premier growth companies with a market value of $15 billion or more.Like Apple (AAPL) in earlier years, when Steve Jobs reassumed the CEO post, then spurred a series of game-changing consumer electronic devices and digital services, San Francisco-based Square has made a big hit with its easy-to-use hardware and software for small shops and individual sole proprietors (think plumbers, taxi drivers and the like) to enable fast, secure transactions at the point of sale.IBD's TAKE: Notice how, on a daily chart, Square is showing two bullish traits. First, the stock found buyers near the 50-day moving average (painted in red on an IBD daily chart), a common occurrence among stocks that get strong institutional support. Second, the relative strength line, drawn in blue in both IBD charts and in IBD's professional-grade stock screening and charting service MarketSmith, has rocketed into new high ground. This means that Square is sharply outperforming the S&P 500.Square lost money from 2012 to 2015, but last year it notched earnings of 4 cents a share. Wall Street now expects profit to catapult 500% higher this year to 24 cents a share and another 79% to 43 cents in 2018.Revenue jumped 35% to $1.71 billion in 2016, up from $203 million in 2012. The Street sees the top line sliding 45% to $942 million this year, but then rebounding 25% to $1.17 billion in 2018.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Square gets a commanding 98 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99, which means that the stock's fundamental, technical and fund sponsorship attributes place it in the top 2% of all companies in IBD's database.As noted in IBD Leaderboard, the current new base is second stage.Apple shares, meanwhile, continue to hold on to a thin gain following an Aug. 2 breakout from a second-stage flat base at 156.75. The stock was featured heavily in IBD's Stock Market Today column back in early January when the iPhone giant broke out of a first-stage bottoming base at 118.12. Shares have since climbed more than 39%.Apple is expected to post a third quarter in a row of double-digit EPS growth, up 13% to $1.88 a share in the September-ending fiscal fourth quarter.Apple's earnings rose 2% in the fiscal first quarter ended in December 2016, snapping a three-quarter streak of falling profits, then grew 11% and 18% in the next two quarters.In FY 2018, earnings are accelerating 21% to $10.91 a share, up from an 8% jump in the current fiscal year.Elsewhere, Oracle (ORCL) is hanging tight ahead of its fiscal first-quarter results due after the close. The stock, nearly flat at 52.74, holds a 12% cushion of gains after it gapped up powerfully on June 22 on improved Q4 results. That move sent shares past a 47.09 entry in a solid flat-base pattern.The database and cloud-based enterprise software giant is mimicking Apple's latest trend of slowly reaccelerating its growth. In the November-ended fiscal second quarter, Oracle's earnings slumped 3%, but then rebounded 8% and 10% in the past two quarters. Analysts see Q1 profit rising 9% to 60 cents a share on a 5% increase in revenue to $9.03 billion.In fiscal Q4, Oracle's net margin improved by 220 basis points to 34.5%.In other financial markets, WTI crude oil futures surged nearly 2% and reached as high as $50.50 a barrel intraday, while natural gas futures eclipsed the $3/million BTU level and hit its highest levels since May of last year. Futures got as high as $3.10.The sell-off in U.S. government bonds remained in place; the yield on the benchmark Treasury 10-year bond returned to the 2.20% level.The spread between the 3-month note (1.05% yield) and the 10-year bond remains healthy at 115 basis points.RELATED:When To Sell A Stock: Take Many Gains When The Profit Reaches This LevelHow To Invest: How To See If It's The Right Time To Buy StocksInvesting For Kids: How To Make A Million Dollars

220,UTX,"The major stock indexes ended mixed Thursday with selling focused in the Nasdaq composite, but losses were tame. Preliminary data showed volume on both exchanges coming in lower than Wednesday's levels.Friday's turnover is likely to jump as weekly and monthly stock and index options expire.XThe Nasdaq lost 0.5% even as chip-equipment stocks outperformed; the S&P 500 eased 0.1% and the Dow Jones industrial average held up well, rising 0.2%. The 30-component Dow industrials scored another record closing high, helped by strength in United Technologies (UTX), Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK).Consumer prices came in a bit hotter than expected in August, rising 0.4% vs. expectations for a 0.3% gain. The core rate, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 0.2%, in line with expectations. Wall Street will have more economic data to ponder on Friday with the release of August retail sales data, the Empire State manufacturing index and the latest reading on consumer confidence from the University of Michigan.Last week, the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index reached a six-month high of 53.4, its 12th straight optimistic reading.Oracle (ORCL) did well in Thursday's after-hours session after reporting earnings. Shares rose 2% to 53.81 after ending the regular session unchanged. Among the highlights, total cloud revenue jumped 51% to $1.5 billion.In the stock market today, Tesla (TSLA) continued to attract buyers after CEO Elon Musk said the unveiling of a semi-truck offering will be out in October. Tesla cleared a cup-with-handle base with a 370.10 buy point, rising 3% to 377.64 in average turnover.Other breakouts included Leaderboard name Square (SQ), which has been a solid performers since its IPO in November 2015 at 9. Shares rose 4% to 28.64. It's still in buy range from a 28.07 buy point. Square is a high-PE stock but deservedly so with annual earnings expected to surge 500% this year and 79% in 2018.IBD'S TAKE: Focusing on newer companies with an innovative product that's driving growth is a good way to achieve big profits in the stock market. To learn more about why ""new"" is so important, check out this lesson in IBD University.In the semiconductor space, Applied Materials (AMAT) was a top gainer in the IBD 50, rising 2% to 47.05. The chip-equipment firm is working on a later-stage base with a 47.69 buy point. Group peer Brooks Automation (BRKS) is also setting up in base with a 30.33 buy point. Shares rose 3% to 28.59. Same with Ultra Clean Holdings (UCTT) which is just below a 26.30 buy point. Shares jumped 5.5% to 25.95.RELATED:5 Oil Stocks Near Buy Zone As Crude Retakes $50: Investing Action PlanApple Kicks Off Augmented-Reality Era With New iPhonesHow To Buy Stocks And Sell Stocks With Success: Read Investor's Corner

221,UTX,"Stocks inched higher at Thursday's open, as unemployment and second-quarter productivity data were mixed, and as investors grappled with a heavy slate of early news.XThe Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite all notched opening gains of less than 0.1%.Concerns over North Korea continued to hang over markets early Thursday, but stocks gained some early lift from news that the Trump administration had straight-armed Republicans in Congress. Trump instead brokered a deal with Democrats that would defer the potential for a government shutdown only to December and immediately free up $7.85 billion in relief funds for those affected by Hurricane Harvey in Houston and the Gulf Coast region. Republicans had sought for a longer-term extension on the debt ceiling, and to separate the question of Hurricane Harvey from the debt ceiling question.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.European markets ran higher following the U.S. budget news, and after the European Central Bank announced it would hold its monetary policy steady for now.  The bank is expected to begin tapering its $2.38 trillion quantitative easing program sometime before the end of the year. A news conference with ECB President Mario Draghi was scheduled following the policy announcement.With Houston and the rest of the Gulf only beginning to recover after Hurricane Harvey, the Caribbean's Leeward Islands are reporting heavy impact from Hurricane Irma. Barbuda reported 95% of structures on the island damaged and 60% of its 1,400 residents homeless. Eight people were reported dead on St. Martin and almost 1 million residents of Puerto Rico are estimated to be without electricity. Haiti and the Dominican Republic are next in line. The National Hurricane Center projects the storm will ease from a Category 5 to Category 4 before its potential landfall in Florida, estimated for late Saturday.Among Dow stocks, Visa (V) and Home Depot (HD) shared an early lead, each up 1.5%. The gain put Home Depot less than 2% below a 160.96 buy point in a flat base.Visa rose on sympathy strength from Mastercard (MA), which surged 3% at the open after the company raised its full-year revenue growth guidance to ""the high end of low double digits."" The gain bumped shares to a new high above a flat base buy point of 125.40.RH (RH), formerly Restoration Hardware, blasted 46% higher at the open. The high-end home furnishings retailer reported an across-the-board, second-quarter beat and stronger-than-expected guidance late Wednesday, adding a second quarter to its recovery. The gain hoisted shares straight up the right side of a month-long consolidation, to within 11% of the stock's July 20 high.China's New Oriental Education & Technology (EDU) bolted 4% higher to lead the IBD 50 list in opening trade. Trade was heavy as the stock struggled to break recent resistance and move to new highs.IBD 50 peer Kemet (KEM) dropped 4% at the open, after announcing late Wednesday an 8.4 million share secondary offering. Kemet shares are extended and well above 10-week support following a strong breakout in May.Productivity surged 1.5% in the second quarter, according to the Labor Department, above the 1.3% jump expected by economists, vs. a 0.9% gain in the first quarter. Unit labor costs, meanwhile, rose a modest 0.2%, down sharply from the first quarter's 0.6% advance and below views for a 0.3% gain.First time unemployment claims jumped to 298,000 in the week ended Sept. 2, up from 236,00 in the prior week, with the impact of Hurricane Harvey along the Gulf Coast lifting results far above forecasts for a slight increase to 241,000. The four-week moving average angled up to 250,250, a broad step up from 236,750 a week earlier.RELATED:5 Stocks Near Buy Points As Market Rebounds: Investing Action Plan  These Four Top Tech Stocks Are A Warning Sign As Nasdaq Struggles With 50-Day LineIBD Investor Research Tools Getting Started With IBD

222,UTX,"Stocks took a home-team bounce Wednesday, largely unaffected by the Fed's Beige Book or deepening tensions between the U.S. and North Korea.XThe major indexes ended pretty much where they started the session, with the Nasdaq Composite, the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 all leveling off with 0.3% gains. Preliminary data showed NYSE and Nasdaq volume was weaker on Wednesday than during Tuesday's sell-off.The beaten down oil and gas drillers group once again nailed the day's best move among the 197 industries tracked by IBD. Helmerich & Payne (HP) was clearly influential, up more than 5% as it attempts to rebound from its deep, eight month dive. Another battered group, department stores, also had a good day: JCPenney (JCP) jumped 6%. Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) added 5% apiece.Among Dow Jones industrial names, Home Depot (HD) set out an early lead and held it through the session, ending 2.6% higher in above-average trade. That left shares less than 3% below a 160.96 buy point in a three-month flat base.Aircraft systems and components maker United Technologies (UTX) dropped 1.6%, the worst hit among Dow stocks. Cowen & Co., downgraded the stock to market perform from outperform Wednesday morning, following Fitch's announcement late Tuesday that it was placing the stock on rating watch negative, due to United's Rockwell Collins (COL) acquisition.Earnings reports delivered mixed results Wednesday. At the extremes, GIII Apparel Group (GIII) bounded 10% higher, putting it 69% above a May low and further up the right side of a 26-month correction. Dave & Buster's (PLAY) collapsed 10%,m surrendering hope of regaining support as shares dived 29% below their early June high. The restaurant company's outlook was weak.HealthEquity (HQY) sent mixed signals after its Q2 report, rising 7%, but only after trimming its initial advance so that shares ended back below both their 10- and 40-week lines.Truckmaker Navistar (NAV) was less conflicted, soaring on a solid fiscal third-quarter beat. The stock was already extended above a 31.47 buy point in an eight-month cup-with-handle base.On the IBD 50, Control4 (CTRL) jumped 3% in solid trade, taking a new closing high.China names bolstered the IBD 50, with New Oriental Education & Technology (EDU), Sina (SINA) and TAL Education (TAL) all ending up more than 2%.

224,UTX,"Boeing (BA) indicated Tuesday it may try to block United Technologies' (UTX) acquisition of Rockwell Collins (COL), as the jet maker looks to keep it market share in the lucrative maintenance and repair business.XBoeing has reportedly been critical of mergers in the past and — along European rival Airbus (EADSY) — privately lobbied against United Tech's efforts early last year to buy another aerospace supplier, Honeywell, according to the Wall Street Journal.""We intend to take a hard look at the proposed combination of United Technologies and Rockwell Collins,"" Boeing said according to Aviation Week. ""Until we receive more details, we are skeptical that it would be in the best interest of—or add value to—our customers and industry.""If Boeing determines the deal is ""inconsistent"" with its interests, ""we would intend to exercise our contractual rights and pursue the appropriate regulatory options to protect our interests,"" the company warned.The deal comes as Boeing looks to ramp up its parts sales and services business, which provides maintenance and technical support and was launched on July 1.""We believe this deal is partly in response to the increased pricing pressure from the leading aerospace OEMs (Airbus and Boeing) and the increased push by the leading OEMs, notably Boeing, into the commercial aftermarket, traditionally the source of most industry profits and cash flow,"" said Canaccord Genuity analyst Ken Herbert said in a note Tuesday.On Monday, United Tech announced it would buy aircraft supplier Rockwell for $140 a share, with $93.33 a share in cash and the rest in stock for a total deal of $23 billion. Including assumed debt, the deal's enterprise value is $30 billion.The combination of United Tech, whose Pratt & Whitney unit makes jet engines, and Rockwell, which makes cockpit and communications systems, is seen as one of the biggest aerospace deals ever. United Tech shares sank 4.8% to 112.28 on the stock market today. Rockwell shares were up 0.5% at 131.26, well below the bid price. Boeing slipped 1.2%, and Honeywell lost 0.8%.IBD'S TAKE: Ready to invest but don't know where to start? An easy to follow routine from IBD can help you grow and protect your money over the long term. Meanwhile, United Tech might not be done shaking up its business. The company needs to break up some of its assets to ""unlock the conglomerate discount and bring this deal to its ultimate logic,"" according to Vertical Research Partners analyst Jeff Sprague.In a note out Tuesday, Sprague wrote that a spin-off of United Tech's buildings units, which includes Carrier air conditioning and Otis elevators, ""could unlock upwards of $20/share in value"" and would be ""the logical conclusion"" to the Rockwell transaction.He pointed out that United Tech said in its press release that it will ""have an opportunity to explore a full range of strategic options,"" a sign the company might already be looking at the deal.M&A activity in the aerospace sector has heated up recently. Rockwell  had just closed its takeover of B/E Aerospace, while Honeywell (HON) has been under pressure to spin off its aerospace unit.RELATED: Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsBoeing Stays Mysterious As Details Set To Emerge On Airbus A321 KillerHoneywell Has This Retort For Activist Investor Pushing Aerospace Spinoff

225,UTX,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved past 20,000 this past week, so it should not be a surprise that many of the 30 blue chip stocks are market leaders. Several are extended, but there are six Dow stocks were in buy range to start this week: Apple (AAPL), Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT), Home Depot (HD), Intel (INTC) and United Technologies (UTX).With the market selling off Monday, several breakouts were tested, with three of these highlighted Dow stocks closing below buy points.Apple broke out of a cup-with-handle base on Jan. 9, clearing a buy point at 118.12.

If you buy above that point, a stock is vulnerable to a pullback.Apple reports earnings on Tuesday, the only one of these six Dow industrials to report this coming week.Analysts expect Apple to report a 2% revenue rise, ending three quarters of decline. But EPS should fall again, though only 2%. Investors are betting that Apple's upcoming 10th anniversary smartphone, unofficially known as the iPhone 8, will revive its fortunes later this year.IBD'S TAKE: The Dow and other major averages are at record highs while leading stocks are breaking out but the CBOE Volatility Index hit a fresh two-and-a-half-year low on Friday, nearly reaching its lowest point since early 2007.

Home Depot will report earnings on Feb. 21.Home closed up 0.1% to 138.47, barely above the entry point.Caterpillar cleared a flat base on Jan. 25, closing slightly above the 97.50 buy point as President Trump authorized a border wall, boosting construction-related firms.

Shares have not moved much since then.On Wednesday, United Tech reported earnings, with Q4 sales and its 2017 revenue forecast a little light amid Pratt & Whitney jet engine production woes.Shares fell 1% last week, closing at 109.70, just above the buy point and the rising 50-day line.United Tech dipped 0.5% to 109.16, below the buy point and the 50-day line.RELATED:Common Investing Mistakes: Chasing A Good Stock Too Far Up In Price

Barra is a member of Trump's strategic and policy forum, a group of CEOs that advises him on economic policy.IBD'S TAKE: Trump has attacked defense contractors for high contract costs.

229,UTX,"General Electric (GE) may have to sell more assets to maintain its current dividend as it battles weak cash flow, and GE investors should brace for more pain after a tough year so far, according to a JPMorgan Chase analyst.XThe industrial conglomerate's fundamentals are ""worse than we think,"" JPMorgan's Stephen Tusa wrote in a note to clients Thursday. Against that backdrop, he believes GE's prized dividends are safe ""for now"" — but likely not without some tough decisions.""GE is already below break-even when it comes to funding the dividend with ongoing free cash flow, with compounding risk if fundamentals come in worse than expectations,"" Tusa wrote. ""Our sense is that GE will sell assets to plug the near-term hole.""But a Morningstar analyst noted in July that Industrial free cash flow turned positive in GE's second quarter at over $700 million, rebounding from the first quarter's negative $2.2 billion.GE could raise $13 billion to $14 billion by selling assets in transportation as well as energy/lighting and renewables, and ""some smaller businesses within larger segments that most people have never heard of"" also could be dumped, Tusa said.He made note of difficult transportation trends into 2018, including weak locomotive demand in the freight markets, and of low cash margins in energy and renewables.But if GE's businesses suffer further in a tougher macro climate, the dividend would be highly vulnerable, ""meaning GE is not a safety stock,"" Tusa — described by Bloomberg as a consistent GE bear — wrote.GE didn't respond to a request for comment.GE's high dividend payouts — the stock currently has a 3.96% yield — have made it attractive to income investors. Many believe the dividend is safe, with the 125-year-old company merely suffering a short-term setback rather than more permanent distress.But others have recently questioned the safety and sustainability of GE's dividends. A Deutsche Bank analyst warned in May that GE's weak cash flow could mean a cut in dividends, prompting a forceful GE rebuttal.IBD'S TAKE: General Electric shares hit a post-financial crisis high in July 2016, but GE has been underperforming the S&P 500 index for the past five years, or even as far back as 2000. Here is how the Relative Strength Line can help you pick the best stocks to invest in.In his note, Tusa maintained an underweight rating on GE stock and a year-end price target of 22.GE shares crumbled 3.6% Thursday after the JPMorgan Chase report and extended losses Friday and Monday morning. GE pegged a fresh two-year intraday low of 23.58 Friday.GE stock is down about 25% year to date, by far the worst performer on the Dow Jones industrial average. The Dow itself is up more than 10% so far in 2017.GE's tumbling share price has flattered its dividend yield, but that's small comfort to investors who have held the stock on the way down.New CEO John Flannery is expected to present his vision for the future in November as well as a potential reset of GE's earnings-per-share targets. One analyst recently suggested that Flannery may shed the health care unit as he puts the company's vast-but-streamlined portfolio under review.Under former CEO Jeff Immelt, GE cut loose its financial and certain consumer units and returned to its industrial core, which include the power, aviation, energy and transportation segments. But those measures failed to revive investor confidence in the company's overall strategy, leading to Immelt's exit this year.Meanwhile, industrial peer 3M (MMM) rose 0.6%, finding resistance at its 50-day moving average within a flat-base consolidation. Honeywell (HON) added 0.4%, Siemens (SIEGY) slipped 0.9% and United Technologies (UTX) shed 0.4%.3M and United Technologies, which this week agreed to buy Rockwell Collins (COL) for $30 billion including debt, are Dow components like GE.RELATED:This 'Outlier' GE Unit May Ironically Be Ripe For Sale Under New CEODow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And AnalysisBest Stocks To Buy And Watch

235,UTX,"President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday directed his ire at another carmaker, threatening Toyota Motor (TM) with a border tax for planning to build a factory in Mexico.""Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S.,"" Trump tweeted. ""NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax.""Toyota already builds Corollas from a factory in Mississippi and had produced more than 500,000 units as of early 2015. While Japan's largest automaker is planning to build a Corolla plant in Mexico, it's slated for Apaseo el Grande, Guanajuato. The company has a factory in Baja, near the California border, building Tacoma pickups.Hours before Trump's tweet, Toyota President Akio Toyoda said he would take the president-elect's decisions into account when planning the automaker's Mexico operations, just after Ford Motor (F) scrapped plans to build a $1.6 billion new plant in the country.Toyota's American depositary receipts were down 0.5% in recent action.Trump's attacks on the auto industry are in keeping with his pledges to revive U.S. manufacturing that has steadily migrated to countries with cheaper labor for decades. He targeted General Motors (GM) earlier this week for building a version of its Cruze compact south of the border.Ford's move on Tuesday closely followed a decision by United Technologies' (UTX) Carrier air conditioning unit in November. Carrier was planning to move from Indiana to Mexico but reversed course on Trump's urging.Toyoda told reporters at a New Year's gathering that he'll handle the situation after understanding it better, when asked for a reaction to the news that Ford had canceled a plan to build a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico following criticism by Trump.

237,UTX,"Ford (F) canceled plans for a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico, hours after President-elect Donald Trump vowed to levy hefty import taxes on cars built outside the U.S., as he accused General Motors (GM) of sending Mexican-made Chevy Cruzes to U.S. car dealers tax free on Tuesday.Trump threatened Ford last year with higher taxes as it looked to move its Focus-model production to Mexico. On Tuesday, Ford said it will invest $700 million to expand a Michigan plant, where it will create 700 jobs and build its new autonomous and electric vehicles.Ford had announced the Mexico plans in April, saying it sought to improve profitability on its small cars, and drew criticism from then-candidate Trump at the time. But CEO Mark Fields refused to back down.On Tuesday, he said he's encouraged by Trump's pro-growth agenda, while noting that the decision to cancel the new Mexico plant was due primarily to weaker demand for small cars. The Focus will instead be made at an existing plant in Mexico.Fields told CNN that the move is a ""vote of confidence"" in Trump's pledge to create a pro-business climate in the U.S., but insisted that Ford ""didn't cut a deal"" with the president elect.Among U.S. automakers, GM has the bigger footprint in Mexico and relies less on U.S. production.In 2015, 63% of GM's North American output came from the U.S., vs. 80% for Ford and 64% for Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), according to IHS Automotive.GM's plans for the Cruze in Mexico were just part of $5 billion in investments that it planned to make in that country by 2018.General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017But a report last week from the Youngstown, Ohio, Vindicator said GM already announced that it would cut jobs at its assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio, and halt the import of Mexican built Cruzes to the U.S.GM said in an emailed statement that ""All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the U.S. are built in GM's assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S.""The company told CNBC that it sold 190,000 Cruzes in the U.S. in 2016, stressing that just 2.4% were made in Mexico, some 4,500 hatchbacks.The next-generation model Cruze will be made in Mexico, but for export markets, shifting production from South Korea.Ford shares rallied 3.8% to 12.59 on the stock market today, rebounding from the 50-day line. GM stock edged up 0.9%.Kansas City Southern (KSU) fell 4.8% on the Ford news to 80.80, its worst close since last February. Ford's Mexico plant was going to be set up next to one of KSU's U.S.-Mexico rail lines.This is just the latest time that Trump attacked businesses on Twitter.Earlier he blasted ""out of control costs"" with the Boeing (BA) Air Force One program and the Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35. IBD'S TAKE: What other high ticket defense programs could Trump attack next?He met with Boeing and Lockheed's CEOs after the tweets and claimed to have gotten better deal after talking with Boeing's Dennis Muilenberg.But Trump is already close with GM's CEO Mary Barra as Barra is a member of Trump's strategic and policy forum, a group of CEOs that advises him on economic policy.And Trump said he helped United Technologies (UTX) Carrier unit keep 1,000 jobs at an Indiana plant that were scheduled to move to Mexico.Boeing shares rose 0.8%.

The industrial conglomerate has largely shed its finance unit and stands to gain from an expected infrastructure spending package as well as any boost to GDP that it produces.IBM topped a 161.96 entry in late November and also has stayed in buy range but for a brief wobble in early December. Ahead of a meeting between President-elect Donald Trump and top tech leaders on Dec. 14, CEO Ginni Rometty said IBM plans to hire 25,000 people in the U.S. and invest $1 billion over the next four years.United Tech decisively moved above its 109.52 buy point in early December and has largely stayed there since. The diversified manufacturer's Carrier unit reversed plans to close an Indiana plant, helped by state incentives and expectations that Trump and the GOP Congress will lower corporate taxes.DuPont broke out at the end of November and edged just above buying territory, but then returned back to the zone.

245,UTX,"Small business owners' optimism soared in December to the highest level since 2004, the National Federation of Independent Business said Tuesday, as President-elect Trump unleashes ""animal spirits"" on Main Street, even as corporate titans such as General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) tread carefully with the president-elect.NFIB's small business optimism index shot up 7.4 points to 105.8, the best reading since December 2004. It was the biggest monthly gain in decades. A net 50% of smaller firms see business conditions improving vs. 12% in November and -7% in October.""We haven't seen numbers like this in a long time,"" said NFIB President and CEO Juanita Duggan. ""Small business is ready for a breakout, and that can only mean very good things for the U.S. economy.""Stock markets have taken off since Election Day — the Nasdaq hit a fresh high Tuesday — as investors bet that Trump's agenda for corporate tax reform and deregulation will boost the economy. Investor, business and consumer optimism suggests a revival of ""animal spirits,"" a term coined by famed economist John Maynard Keynes on how companies' confidence can fuel investment and spending.The share of small firms saying now is a good time to expand is triple what's normally seen in an expansion.IBD'S TAKE: Bank stocks are among the few sectors that should benefit from Trump's fiscal plans and Federal Reserve rate hike.But there are concerns on Wall Street about Trump's protectionist instincts and his zeal for praising or criticizing individual companies — and how they respond.Trump last week criticized General Motors for selling Mexico-made Chevy Cruze cars in the U.S., as well as plans by Toyota (TM) to set up a plant in Mexico with plans to export Corollas to America. Ford, which also has come under fire from Trump for its Mexico ventures, scrapped a $1.6 billion Mexico plant. Since his election, Trump has criticized the cost of contracts for new Air Force One jets by Boeing (BA) as well as the Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35 fighter jet.Alibaba (BABA) founder Jack Ma on Monday became the latest tech titan to visit Trump Tower, following a Trump tech summit with the heads of Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Tesla Motors (TSLA) and many others late last month.Trump has called on Apple to bring back iPhone production to the U.S., a move that would undoubtedly make the smartphone far more expensive. Apple on Monday requested to make ""finished products"" and use ""high tech manufacturing"" at a Mesa, Ariz., site. Apple already has permission to make various components at the plant.It's unclear how much Trump's high-profile tweets and other remarks have actually influenced corporate strategy, though the president-elect has been quick to take credit for any decisions that seem to show businesses following his lead.Ford will still make small cars for U.S. export in Mexico, but from an existing plant. And that switch may have to do with declining demand for smaller sedans, which are less profitable in any case.Regardless, Trump's protectionist, highly public management isn't an issue for small businesses. Smaller firms export and import far less than s&P 500 giants, and there's little risk that the incoming president will target a mom-and-pop operation in Topeka, Kansas. Also, corporate tax cuts could especially benefit smaller firms, who have less scope and expertise to adopt global tax avoidance strategies like Apple and other multinationals.November's NFIB survey also showed notable increases, with postelection responses particularly strong. December's results confirm that bounce, with newfound optimism continuing to rise.A net 31% expect sales to rise, up 20 points from November and 30 points from October. Now 29% of small firms are planning on more capital expenditures.Sixty-three percent of small businesses boosted capital spending, up 8 points from November.""Business owners are feeling better about taking risks and making investments,"" NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg said.However, hiring plans remain lackluster. Job creation increased by 0.01 worker per firm in December and job openings dropped two points, NFIB said. It cited tight labor markets and a lack of qualified staff.The National Association of Home Builders' Housing Market Index for December sprinted to its highest level since 2005, even with higher mortgage rates making housing less affordable for new buyers, creating a headwind for demand and prices.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index leapt to a 10-year high in December, even with Democrats turning gloomy. The January IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index will be released on Wednesday.RELATED:Alibaba Founder Ma Describes Trump Meeting As Very ProductiveTrump Praises Ford, Chrysler, But GM Bypasses U.S. In GMC MoveEconomic Optimism Hits 10-Year High On Trump, But Democrats Are Blue

246,UTX,"President-elect Donald Trump's suggestion late Thursday that cost overruns on Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 could result in orders for Boeing's (BA) older and less capable F/A-18 Super Hornet only makes sense for the Navy, according to a Drexel Hamilton analyst.Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016Earlier this month, Trump blasted the F-35 program for having ""out of control"" costs. On Monday, Pentagon officials said costs for successive production batches have been coming down and will continue to fall. On Wednesday, he met with Lockheed's CEO. But Trump's latest tweet keeps the heat on the defense contractor.""In our view, the F-35 could be shaping up to be the biggest target for defense savings through President-elect Donald Trump's term in office,"" Drexel Hamilton analyst Pete Skibitski wrote in a note Friday.The cost to develop and build the F-35 is about $400 billion, and the Pentagon is buying 2,443 F-35s for the Air Force (1,763), Navy (340) and Marine Corps (340), with U.S. allies buying hundreds more.The Super Hornet lacks short-takeoff and vertical-landing capabilities so is likely not a good fit for the Marine Corps, and the Air Force doesn't fly the plane now so it's unlikely to fit in there, Skibitski noted. But the Navy, which already has a large number of Super Hornets in its fleet, represents the biggest risk for Lockheed.Each Super Hornet costs roughly $50 million, which is about 40% cheaper than the F-35's projected $85 million unit cost by 2019.Skibitski estimates that if the Navy goes with the F/A-18, it would jeopardize $28.9 billion for Lockheed and the company would lose 6% a year in earnings before interest and taxes over the next decade.Lockheed shares fell 1.3% to 249.54 on the stock market today, moving back below their 50-day line. Boeing shares climbed 0.2%. Major F-35 subcontractor Northrop Grumman (NOC) was off 0.4%, while F-35 engine supplier United Technologies (UTX) edged up 0.2%.Skibitski also pointed out ""there is a clear technology difference"" between the F-35 and Super Hornet. The stealthy F-35 is a ""fifth generation"" fighter, while the Super Hornet doesn't have stealth technology and is considered a fourth generation fighter.And the Pentagon can't just award Boeing a fighter contact without holding a new competition.""The government would be violating the law to award a contract to Boeing without a competition unless they go through exceptions to the normal legal requirements for competition,"" Daniel Gordon, the Obama administration's administrator for federal procurement policy, told the Wall Street Journal. RELATED: Trump Seeks To Cancel Air Force One Order, Targets Boeing ProfitTrump Goes Nuclear, But This Time Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon Rise

247,UTX,"President-elect Donald Trump tweeted late Thursday that he has asked Boeing (BA) for a price on F/A-18 Super Hornets, citing the cost of Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35.Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016Shares of Lockheed were down 2% in late trading on the stock market today, after closing up 0.1% in the regular session. Boeing edged up 0.7% late. Northrop Grumman (NOC) and United Technologies (UTX), which are major F-35 subcontractors, lost about 1%.Earlier this month, Lockheed and Boeing were targets of Trump, who called the F-35's costs ""out of control"" and vowed to cancel Boeing's Air Force One replacement jets due to the cost.The CEOs of both companies met with Trump on Wednesday, and Boeing promised to keep the cost of the Air Force One program below $4 billion.On Monday, the F-35's program office told reporters that costs for the next batch of jets will be down ""significantly."" The Pentagon plans to negotiate prices for the 10th lot of F-35s, with the cost for each variant seen coming down 6%-7%, said Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, the Defense Department's F-35 program manager.The cost to develop and build the F-35 is about $400 billion, and the program is perennially under fire for cost overruns and delays. The Pentagon is buying more than 2,400 F-35s for the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps, and U.S. allies will buy hundreds more.With its stealth technology and advanced system integration and avionics, the F-35 is considered a ""fifth generation"" fighter, while the Super Hornet lacks stealth technology and is considered a fourth generation fighter.Boeing's export opportunities for the Super Hornet have been challenged as countries wait for the more advanced F-35. But last month Canada said it is buying 18 Super Hornets as a stopgap measure after backing away from a decision to buy the F-35 and, instead, restarting a fighter competition. Kuwait is also buying 32 Super Hornets, while Israel added to its F-35 purchase.

248,UTX,"ARLINGTON, Va. — President-elect Donald Trump has Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 in his cross hairs as an example of ""out of control"" costs at the Pentagon, but the Joint Strike Fighter's program office said Monday that costs for the next batch of jets will be down ""significantly.""Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, the Defense Department's F-35 program manager, said Trump's transition team hadn't been briefed by the program office before his tweet about the cost last week. The team has since called to ask more about it, but a meeting hasn't been ""fully scheduled yet.""""I have no doubt that given the controversy over the F-35 program over the years that there is a perception the program is out of control as the first F-35s cost twice as much as we thought they were going to. That's in the past,"" Bogdan told reporters at a briefing.If given the chance to speak to Trump, he would give ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" about the $400 billion stealth fighter program.Under last month's $6.1. billion contract with Lockheed for the ninth batch of 57 F-35s, the cost for the Air Force's A model fell 5.5% to $102.1 million vs. the eighth lot, and the Marines' B model fell 1.8% to $131.6 million.But the Navy's C model rose 2.5% to $132.2 million as two fewer jets were ordered in lot nine.The Pentagon plans to negotiate prices for the 10th lot of F-35s, with the cost for each variant seen coming down 6%-7%, Bogdan said.Meanwhile, updating the Autonomic Logistics Information System, the so called brains of the plane, has been ""harder than expected,"" he added.The software will be fielded in February, two months later than anticipated, and issues with insulation on coolant lines have caused production to slow down and won't be caught up until August 2017.Lockheed shares closed up 0.8% on the stock market today. Shares of United Technologies (UTX), whose Pratt and Whitney division makes the engines for the fighter, rose 2% on an analyst upgrade. Northrop Grumman (NOC), a key subcontractor on the F-35, edged up 0.8%.IBD'S TAKE: The F-35 wasn't the only program to come under fire from Trump. He first threatened to cancel Boeing's Air Force One program.Despite Monday's gains, shares of Lockheed, Northrop and Raytheon (RTN) have yet to recover from Trump's F-35 criticism last week, as analysts see high-profile weapons programs coming under more scrutiny.Earlier Monday at an Atlantic Council event, Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said she had met with the transition team and explained that ""it's not quite as easy as it seems to get these costs down,"" according to reports.RELATED:Navy Faces Carrier Jet Shortfall, Reportedly Looking At More Super HornetsIsrael Thinks Lockheed F-35s Are Still Awesome, Will Buy More

250,UTX,"General Electric (GE) shares wallowed near multiyear lows Tuesday as two Wall Street analysts soured on the industrial giant's worsening fundamentals, including its credit and earnings outlooks.XJPMorgan analyst Steve Tusa wondered how long credit-rating agencies can ""remain on the sidelines with their commentary, seemingly giving GE precious time to work their way out,"" given a host of problems.Problems dogging the 126-year-old industrial giant include ""material changes in fundamentals,"" little progress on asset sales, delays in revenue recognition restatements, a lack of ""clean numbers"" and an SEC investigation, according to Tusa. The analyst also pointed out that during the Great Recession, GE was AAA-rated and needed a bailout.""So we scratch our heads as to the repeated inertia"" from ratings watchdogs, which should start to get more attention, Tusa wrote in a note to clients Tuesday.He remains cautious on the stock, finding GE's fundamentals are ""worse than expected"" and calling out its ""currently unjustified rating."" The recent appointment of a Moody's board member to its own board should raise investors' eyebrows, in Tusa's view.Moody's cut GE's long-term debt rating in November, citing ""extreme deterioration"" in its energy business. The cut from A1 to A2 still kept the company's bonds in the investment grade category. Also in November, Fitch cut its rating to A+ from AA-, still in investment grade.Tusa, however, has an underweight rating on the stock with an 11 price target, down from 14 a month ago.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The current plan calls for the pace to rise to 52 a month next year, then 57 a month in 2019. That's up from a planned pace of 47 a month this year.

The stock is now forming a new base. Textron (TXT) broke out of a base Monday to the highest price since June 2008. The company's businesses include Bell Helicopter, Cessna aircraft and combat vehicles.Defense spending rarely drops, which is one reason iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense has been a good long-term performer. The ETF's only down year in the last 10 was 2008, while the financial crisis unfolded. The fund's five-year total return is more than 20% and the 10-year return is about 11%, according to the iShares website.Shorter term, there are hurdles. President Trump is seeking to boost military spending, although Congress made a much smaller proposal and both plans are well beyond current spending caps.Commercial aviation has been a growth industry of its own, largely because many airlines have been busy ordering new jets with higher fuel efficiency and other operating advantages.Although risks in that segment appear to be minimal, a Canaccord Genuity analyst saw greater potential in defense stocks.""We believe there is more upside in the defense sector in the next two years than in the commercial aerospace sector ..., which we believe will be a tailwind for defense stocks into 2018,"" analyst Ken Herbert wrote in a report last month. ""Note that defense investment outlays, as of June, were up (about) 4% on a rolling-12-month basis.

But revenue and returns fell short of expectations, and the Predix industrial software platform was dogged by problems this spring, according to Reuters.I have decided not to pursue a leadership position at Uber. I have immense respect for the company & founders — Travis, Garrett and Ryan.— Jeff Immelt (@JeffImmelt) August 27, 2017But those problems have now been fixed, the report added, and GE will focus on sales to existing customers in its energy, aviation and oil-and-gas businesses, while paring back sales efforts to new customers in other sectors.IBD'S TAKE: GE is a laggard among Dow stocks this year. But the Dow's top stock may be offering a new entry point.""Our resources will go to our fastest-selling markets,"" GE Digital Chief Executive Officer Bill Ruh told Reuters in an interview.Additionally, to help investors better understand Predix and avoid double-counting, GE has redefined digital revenue to shut out certain hardware sales and emphasize ""pure"" software sales.As a result, GE officials now anticipate $12 billion in digital revenue in 2020 vs. $15 billion earlier.The Predix platform — a cloud-based operating system for what GE calls the industrial internet — outfits turbines, jet engines wind farms and medical equipment with data-collecting sensors and then analyzes that data to analyze performance, cut costs or create new businesses for GE customers.GE estimates the market could be worth $225 billion market by 2020.Shares were unchanged at 24.49 in morning trade on the stock market today.

263,UTX,"New Year predictions last almost as long as New Year's resolutions. A year ago, the Federal Reserve was forecasting four rate hikes in 2016 and Hillary Clinton was the favorite to win the presidency.The unknowns for 2017 start with the tone set by Washington. Will investors see ""good Trump"" or ""bad Trump""? Will Republicans repeal and replace ObamaCare?On the economic front, will OPEC and allies carry out oil production cuts — and how fast will U.S. shale companies boost output? Tesla (TSLA) is supposed to begin deliveries of its Model 3, but the roads are getting crowded with electric vehicles. Apple (AAPL) hopes the iPhone 8 will wow consumers and revive sales. Snapchat is set to go public; will Uber and other big unicorns follow?This new year may be as unpredictable as any, but here are 10 key issues and challenges to watch that will affect your investments and the economy.Investor's Business Daily's Ed Carson, Jed Graham, Allison Gatlin, Elaine Low, Gillian Rich, Patrick Seitz, Brian Deagon and Bill Peters contributed to this article.Donald Trump promises an ambitious agenda: a 15% corporate tax rate; repealing ObamaCare, Dodd-Frank and other regulations; and a $1 trillion infrastructure program. The U.S. economy has been stuck in second gear for years, with businesses reluctant to invest. The prospect of a Trump administration already has revived ""animal spirits,"" and the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index and other business surveys show soaring confidence.But the populist president-elect has a zeal for conducting ad hoc industrial policy in public. He's used Twitter and TV to target United Technologies (UTX), Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) as well as drug prices.And his protectionist instincts could have serious consequences, given a president's broad authority on trade. Trump could adopt a few anti-dumping duties on China, expanding on actions by Presidents Bush and Obama. Or he could withdraw from Nafta or trigger a full-blown trade war with China that roils the global economy.So far investors are betting that Trump's pro-growth, low-tax agenda will carry the day. Stocks have rallied strongly since Election Day. But some sectors — banks, steel, mining — have fared better than others.Before the election, the Federal Reserve worried that slow growth had become a chronic condition for the U.S. economy. In 2017 the Fed will shift to the role of traffic cop, trying to keep the economy from blowing past its speed limit.If Trump's fiscal fuel sparks inflationary pressures, the Fed could raise rates by more than the three quarter-point hikes that the central bank is predicting. But a positive scenario could play out if Trump's policies boost productivity, essentially raising the speed limit so the economy can drive faster without an upsurge in inflation.The Fed will likely follow financial markets' lead. In recent years, the Fed has spoken loudly but carried a Wiffle bat. Policymakers' goal of four rate hikes in 2016 was whittled down to one quarter-point move at year-end, in large part due to concerns about global markets.The Fed in 2017 will include two new Trump appointments to fill vacancies. Trump's appointees may be especially open to the idea that his deregulation and corporate tax cuts can help revive productivity growth and increase labor-force participation. And by year-end Trump likely will nominate his choice for Fed chief; Janet Yellen's term ends in February 2018.RELATED:In 2017, Fed Will Play Traffic Cop As Trump Hits Fiscal AcceleratorRepublicans appear intent on kicking off 2017 with a vote to repeal ObamaCare but may delay actually replacing the system for years.The health exchanges have been struggling, with younger and healthier people declining to sign up, even with the individual mandate. Republicans can get rid of the law's sweeping tax and spending provisions. But with only 52 votes in the Senate, GOP leaders couldn't overturn coverage mandates without at least some Democratic support.Republicans could repeal ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion, perhaps via block grants that would give states much more flexibility over federal funds.Yet many health policy experts and industry players have warned that a repeal without replacement could blow up the individual insurance market operating under ObamaCare rules. Many health insurers such as UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET) are already pulling out of most exchanges, tired of suffering losses.They and their peers may throw in the towel entirely if the law is largely repealed without a long-term replacement. If wide swathes of the country lack an individual market insurer for 2018, what will the government do?RELATED:Trump, GOP Face Huge 'Now What?' ObamaCare MomentAfter a rough 2016 with drug prices under the campaign spotlight, a slew of potential FDA approvals and big trial data, particularly in the cancer arena, could catalyze biotech stocks.The FDA is slated to examine PARP inhibitors from Tesaro (TSRO) and Clovis Oncology (CLVS) to treat ovarian cancer. The duo will compete in a multibillion-dollar market with already-approved Lynparza from AstraZeneca (AZN). Celgene (CELG) has a multiple myeloma drug under FDA priority review. The FDA will also look at Ariad Pharmaceuticals' (ARIA) brigatinib, which fights non-small-cell lung cancer.Kite Pharma (KITE) is expected to seek approval for its refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma drug, an early CAR-T treatment. Seattle Genetics (SGEN) aims to change traditional Hodgkin lymphoma therapy when it unveils phase-three data.Meanwhile, Axovant Sciences (AXON) and Biogen (BIIB) each have data on Alzheimer's treatments due in 2017. Drugs that significantly slow cognitive decline would be huge blockbusters.Some biomed companies may make announcements about drugs or financials at the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in January.RELATED:Which Top 5 Biotech Stocks In 2016 Are Slated For Triple-Digit Gains?Seattle Genetics CEO Angles For Hodgkin's Lymphoma EurekaOil stocks have rallied since crude prices bottomed in early 2016, and the industry has reason for cautious optimism. After a two-year effort to drive out U.S. shale producers largely failed, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries — along with top non-OPEC producers — agreed to cut production by nearly 1.8 million barrels per day starting in January to prop up oil prices. But cartel members have a history of breaking production quotas.Russia already has said that it will only gradually lower production, and analysts expect Iraq to be the first OPEC member to cheat on its output target. Even if OPEC's plan fails, the International Energy Agency sees oil markets balancing in the second half of 2017, helped by rising demand.But will crude prices, which more than doubled from early 2016 lows, continue to climb? That may depend on how quickly U.S. shale production revives. U.S. crude output started to climb as the number of oil rigs in use rose sharply in recent weeks and months. Many shale players have cut their costs and can profit at lower oil price levels.Trump's pick for secretary of state, Exxon Mobil (XOM) CEO Rex Tillerson, is another bullish sign for U.S. oil companies headed into 2017, given Tillerson's experience with international energy trade deals.A lot rides on Apple's 11th-generation smartphone due out in the fall. Unofficially called the iPhone 8, the 10th anniversary model could sport a radical redesign, with a glass sandwich look, borderless OLED display, invisible home button and wireless charging.Bullish analysts believe the iPhone 8 could create a ""supercycle"" of upgrade activity after three generations of similar-looking iPhones. IPhone shipments fell 8% in Apple's fiscal 2016 ended Sept. 24 vs. a 4% decrease for the overall premium smartphone market.Many analysts see Apple returning to smartphone sales growth next year, thanks to the iPhone 8. Apple's fast-growing services business — which includes Apple Music, Apple Pay, iCloud and more — is another expected bright spot for 2017.Others are more pessimistic. Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz has predicted that ""Apple is about to embark on a decadelong malaise."" Apple's fortunes are over-reliant on the iPhone, and the company ""lacks the courage to lead the next generation of innovation (AI, cloud-based services, messaging),"" he said.Initial public offerings are expected to rebound in 2017 from a seven-year low. Among the first high-profile new stocks is likely to be Snapchat owner Snap, one of the widely watched tech ""unicorns"" valued above $1 billion. Snap's IPO, expected in the first quarter, could raise $4 billion and value the company at $25 billion.Snapchat is growing rapidly, but the parent company has struggled to turn a profit. And it faces competition from Facebook (FB), whose photo-sharing Instagram site is adopting Snapchat-like features.Other unicorns expected to go public in 2017 are music service provider Spotify, software maker AppDynamics and data analytics company Palantir. Uber, valued at $68 billion, is not expected to IPO in 2017. Neither is Airbnb.Renaissance Capital believes activity will pick up significantly in 2017, ""breaking the long IPO recession"" that started in August 2015.In 2016, 105 IPOs raised $18.8 billion. Both the number and dollar value fell 38% from 2015. The top-performing IPO of 2016 was optical components supplier Acacia Communications (ACIA), which is up 168.5% from its May IPO price of 23. But it has lost more than half its value since early September, ending the year at a five-month low.The overall stock market trend will be critical to IPO activity and success. If the postelection rally continues, more companies will go public and will likely fare well. But if the stock indexes move sideways or correct, unicorns will be rare.RELATED:IPO Outlook For 2017: Amid Mixed Predictions, Focus On The Chart ActionThe electric-car race will intensify when Tesla Motors introduces its long-awaited Model 3 in the second half of 2017. It will be Tesla's most affordable car, with a base-model cost of about $35,000, far less than the more-upscale Model S sedan and Model X crossover SUV.Tesla is on track to deliver about 80,000 vehicles in 2016 and aims to ramp up auto production to 500,000 deliveries a year by 2018.Tesla has a history of missing deadlines and cutting production targets, though CEO Elon Musk will strive to get at least some Model 3 vehicles out the door next year. Musk also will be busy integrating recently acquired SolarCity as well as completing Tesla's battery Gigafactory.Meanwhile, General Motors (GM), Ford (F), Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Toyota (TM) and Volkswagen (VLKAY) are selling or planning to introduce all-electric vehicles that target many of the same potential buyers as the Model 3. Like the Model 3, they will have self-driving features.Tesla also faces threats from tech giants such as Alphabet (GOOGL) and Apple. Alphabet has spun out its self-driving car efforts into its own unit, Waymo. But the Google parent has backed off plans to create vehicles with no steering wheel or pedals in favor of partnerships with existing carmakers.Apple, which has never acknowledged its Project Titan efforts, reportedly has shifted from making a self-driving electric car to developing operating systems for autonomous vehicles.Mobileye (MBLY) and Delphi (DLPH) will showcase their turnkey autonomous-driving technology at CES 2017 in early January.It's still unclear if electric cars are ready for mass adoption. They are more expensive than gas-powered vehicles — and federal tax credits will soon expire for new Tesla buyers. And charging takes far longer than filling up the tank.Fears of cord-cutting — pay-TV subscribers canceling their cable packages — continue to abound in the media space. But a recent PwC survey, which found that 76% of respondents were pay-TV subscribers in 2016 vs. 79% the year before, suggests that ""cord-cutting may continue at a much slower rate than predicted.""Still, subscriber losses at ESPN, owned by Walt Disney (DIS), raise concerns about the power of live sports programming to discourage viewers from dumping their all-inclusive cable packages.Hulu — owned by Disney, 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Comcast (CMCSA) unit NBCUniversal and Time Warner (TWX) — plans to roll out a live-streaming service in the new year that will include broadcast and cable networks. Google's YouTube is also said to be working on a streaming TV service that could go live in 2017.The two players would join a crop of over-the-top TV competitors including Sling TV (Dish Network (DISH)), PlayStation Vue (Sony (SNE)) and DirecTV Now (AT&T (T)).After a long slog through years of low rates, weak economic growth and post-crisis regulation, banks appear set for a better 2017. Trump's transition team has said the incoming president will ""dismantle"" Dodd-Frank. His tax-and-spending programs could boost demand but also lift inflation, triggering more Federal Reserve rate hikes. Wider yield spreads should expand banks' net interest margins.All this sent bank stocks soaring along with Treasury yields in late 2016, especially after the presidential election. Bank of America (BAC) is seen as the most U.S.-exposed of the big banks, meaning it is most likely to benefit from any rate hikes from the Fed and faster U.S. economic growth.Meanwhile, Citigroup (C) still has significant international operations that could be hurt if Trump sets U.S. trade deals ablaze.Dozens of smaller banks have hit multiyear highs. Bank investors are pricing in aggressive Fed and Trump moves in 2017 with bond yields continuing to climb. But if those actions do not occur, bank earnings and stocks may disappoint.RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market Review

Consumer inflation jumped to a two-year high in November while weekly jobless claims fell.The Philadelphia Federal Reserve manufacturing index popped to a two-year high of 21.5 vs. 7.6 in November. The New York Fed's Empire State manufacturing index rose by 7.5 points to 9, the strongest since April.Looking ahead, the Philly Fed's outlook gauge nearly doubled to 52.6 from 29.3, hitting the highest since January 2015. The Empire State's future gauge was the best in nearly five years.Higher corporate sentiment could spur more hiring and investment, the latter of which has been poor throughout the current economic expansion.Separately, Markit's flash December reading for U.S. manufacturing nudged higher to a 21-month high.However, many industrial companies are struggling. Nucor (NUE) warned on Q4 profit Thursday morning, initially hitting other steel makers such as U.S. Steel (X) and Steel Dynamics (STLD) on the stock market today.

Economists had expected 63. Readings over 50 signal confidence. Mortgage rates have soared to two-year highs following Trump's election on expectations for faster economic growth, higher inflation and more Federal Reserve hikes. But builders were cheered by the prospect that the real estate mogul will be in the White House.Shares of Toll Bros. (TOL), D.R. Horton (DHI) and LGI Homes (LGIH) initially rose but 0.6%, 2.1% and 3%, respectively.The consumer price index rose 0.2% in November, the Labor Department said. That's in line with views and follows October's 0.4% gain. It was the fourth straight monthly increase, with housing and gasoline fueling November's advance. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, climbed 0.2%.Year over year, consumer prices climbed 1.7%, the most in two years. Core inflation edged up to 2.2%.The Fed has a 2% inflation target, though it's favorite price gauge, the core PCE deflator, is still not at that level. Fed chief Janet Yellen and some policymakers have hinted at a willingness to let the economy run a little hot in the short run.But the Fed did raise rates on Wednesday and forecast three hikes in 2017.Jobless claims fell by 4,000 to a three-week-low 254,000 in the week ended Dec. 10, Labor said.

272,UTX,"President Trump said Wednesday he's disbanding two advisory groups of American business leaders, after CEOs quit this week as the president faced blowback for failing to sufficiently condemn white supremacists.Trump made the announcement on Twitter, less than an hour after one of the groups was said to be planning to inform the White House that it would disband.Rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council & Strategy & Policy Forum, I am ending both. Thank you all!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 16, 2017Trump's remarks were a reversal of what he said a day before, when he tweeted that he had plenty of CEOs who wanted to be on the panels to replace those who quit, and called the CEOs who left ""grandstanders.""Several more CEOs on the councils said after Trump's remarks that they had informed their respective panels that they would step down, suggesting that Trump scrapped the panels before they dissolved entirely.The strategy council, led by Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman, said that participation had become an unwelcome ""distraction.""BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told staff in a Wednesday memo that he had informed the strategy council he was stepping down within the past 24 hours.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, who earlier this year hailed Trump for reigniting ""animal spirits,"" said Wednesday afternoon that ""it is a leader's role...to bring people together, not tear them apart.""The strategy group is one of several the White House convened earlier this year to advise the president. Several CEOs from a manufacturing council quit this week, following blowback over Trump's remarks about racially charged violence in Virginia on Saturday.Pressure to leave the groups has grown following a press conference Trump held in New York Tuesday where he placed partial blame for the weekend violence on demonstrators protesting a gathering of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va. A woman was killed during the event after a man rammed a car into a crowd.While more than half a dozen CEOs have quit a manufacturing CEO group, others have said they wanted to stay on the panels in order to influence White House policy.The manufacturing council hasn't met since February. The CEOs of Under Armour (UAA), Intel (INTC) and Merck (MRK) quit earlier this week. And on Wednesday Inge Thulin, CEO of 3M (MMM), left, as did Campbell Soup (CPB) CEO Denise Morrison.""Following yesterday's remarks from the president, I cannot remain on the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative,"" Morrison said in a statement. ""I will continue to support all efforts to spur economic growth and advocate for the values that have always made America great.""Jeff Immelt of General Electric (GE), Alex Gorsky of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Gregory Hayes of United Technologies (UTX) stepped down from the manufacturing council minutes after Trump said he was scrapping that body. Immelt said he had informed the council Wednesday morning of his decision.RELATED:Big Business Dumps Trump: 4 Execs Quit Council; But This One Is Staying

273,UTX,"IBM (IBM) Chief Executive Ginni Rometty said Tuesday she plans to hire about 25,000 people in the U.S. and invest $1 billion over the next four years, laying out her vision for filling technology jobs in America on the eve of a meeting of industry leaders with President-elect Donald Trump.Rometty, who is on Trump's advisory panel of business leaders, will join Facebook's (FB) Sheryl Sandberg, Amazon.com's (AMZN) Jeff Bezos and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Larry Page and Eric Schmidt at a summit with Trump on Wednesday in New York that is said to focus on jobs.During the run-up to the election, Trump made employment issues a mainstay of his campaign, promising to scrap trade deals he viewed as draining jobs from the country and impose tariffs on imports if necessary. He has since claimed credit for preventing thousands of manufacturing jobs from moving overseas and used state incentives to strike a deal with Carrier, a unit of United Technologies (UTX), to pull back on its plans to move some operations to Mexico.Rometty is continuing what is emerging as a formula among technology companies. In conjunction with meetings with Trump in his Manhattan tower, they're pledging to create jobs and invest billions of dollars in the U.S., even if the plans had already been in the works since before he was elected.The advantage for companies is that it can deflect criticism from the new administration that the industry is shifting jobs offshore, while also giving Trump a way to take credit for job creation goals that may have little to do with his election.IBM said in March that it had more than 25,000 positions open globally and that it had started to cut some jobs in the U.S. as part of a ""workforce rebalancing"" in an effort to add staff with cloud and other specific skills.Over the past few years, IBM — like many large U.S.-based companies — has been criticized for eliminating thousands of jobs in the country and moving resources to places such as India. The company reported fewer employees at the end of 2013 than the beginning of the year for the first time in a decade, and reduced its total workforce by 12 t year. IBM said it hired more U.S. employees last year than it had in the five years prior.In an Op-Ed piece in USA Today, Rometty said many technology jobs don't require an advanced degree and she encouraged government investment in vocational education and training.""We are hiring because the nature of work is evolving,"" Rometty wrote. That's also why many of the jobs are hard to fill, she said.""What matters most is that these employees — with jobs such as cloud computing technicians and services delivery specialists — have relevant skills, often obtained through vocational training,"" she went on to say.IBM has been honing its vision for training for months and it's unrelated to the election or the meeting Wednesday, the company said.Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM has been working on hiring for and preparing its employees in skills required to adapt to the newer areas of its business, such as cloud computing, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. For example, about a third of its workforce will have learned by the end of this year design thinking, a problem-solving method favored by many tech startups.The dynamics of the global labor market have been changing, and there are large numbers of unfilled tech-related jobs in the U.S., Rometty said. The disconnect comes from the lack of people with the requisite skills, she said.""As industries from manufacturing to agriculture are reshaped by data science and cloud computing, jobs are being created that demand new skills – which in turn requires new approaches to education, training and recruiting,"" she wrote.In the Op-Ed, Rometty called for an update in early 2017 to the Perkins Career and Technical Education Act, which provides federal funding to vocational and technical programs. She also highlighted an education model — that IBM helped design — of a six-year public high school, which combines traditional coursework, community college classes and internships focused on preparing students for technical jobs. IBM will work with states to open at least 20 more of these schools in the next year, she wrote.""We will need new kinds of collaboration involving federal and state governments, public school systems, community colleges and private business, across multiple industries,"" she said.

274,UTX,"Small business owners are more upbeat, with optimism surging after Election Day, according to National Federation of Independent Business data released Tuesday.The NFIB's small business optimism index rose 3.5 points to 98.4, the highest since the cycle peak in December 2014. But that masks the sentiment shift after Donald Trump won the presidential election and Republicans retained control of Congress.""What a difference a day makes,"" said Juanita Duggan, NFIB President and CEO. ""Before Election Day small business owners' optimism was flat, and after Election Day it soared.""A net 15% of companies plan to add staff, up from 10%. But job creation plans shot up from a net 9% through Nov. 8 to 23% after Election Day. A net 20% of small business owners expect higher sales postelection, up from 4% in early November.Most notably, a net 38% expected business conditions to improve after Trump's victory vs. -6% through Nov. 8. That's the highest since November 2004.""If higher optimism can be sustained, I expect that in the coming months we'll see an increase in business activity, such as hiring and expanding,"" said NFIB chief economist William Dunkelberg.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index rose to a 10-year high in December, even with Democrat sentiment falling.Stock markets have rallied as investors see corporate tax reform, regulatory relief and perhaps ObamaCare repeal. Small businesses have even more to cheer.Unlike multinational giants, especially techs such as Apple (AAPL) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) that have vast intellectual property assets, small firms can't sidestep the taxman via complex, global tax-minimization schemes. So lower business tax rates will have a big impact on their after-tax profits.Also, Trump and a GOP Congress could eliminate or slash the estate tax, a huge issue for small business owners.Regulatory relief would have outsized benefits on smaller firms, which lack dedicated staff focused on compliance with complex and costly rules.""Small business owners are clearly encouraged by the election results, but now it's time for President-elect Trump and congressional leaders to deliver,"" said Duggan. ""Federal taxes, regulations, and ObamaCare are the three biggest impediments to running a small business in America.""Trump carries risks for business, but more for corporate titans than Main Street minnows. Small businesses have less to fear from Trump's protectionist instincts than S&P 500 companies that have big exports, imports and overseas operations. And Trump isn't likely to single out a small firm for public criticism.Trump in recent days has blasted Boeing (BA) over Air Force One presidential jet replacement costs and the ""out of control"" F-35 by Lockheed Martin (LMT). He's criticized and later reached a deal with United Technologies (UTX) over Carrier jobs in Indiana heading to Mexico.

The problem was tied to a knife-edge seal in the high-pressure compressor aft hub on the engine.United Technologies and its Dow Jones industrial average peer General Electric have both been dogged by issues with their next-generation jet engines.

279,UTX,"In a surprise decision, the International Trade Commission ruled in a 4-0 vote Friday that Bombardier's C Series jet did not harm Boeing (BA), which claimed it was sold below market prices with help from government subsidies.X The ITC's unanimous vote shuts down the Commerce Department's recommendation to hit the Canadian company's C Series jet with a near-300% duty on sales to American carriers.Boeing had claimed Bombardier was able to sell the aircraft at ""absurdly low prices"" in the U.S. after receiving $3 billion in government subsidies. Bombardier has said Boeing's case has no merit and that its actual intent is to force Bombardier out of the 100-seat market as it looks to acquire a competing maker of small jets.""Today's decision is a victory for innovation, competition, and the rule of law,"" Bombardier said in a statement. ""It is also a victory for U.S. airlines and the U.S. traveling public. The C Series is the most innovative and efficient new aircraft in a generation. Its development and production represent thousands of jobs in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.""And the firm reiterated its commitment to open up a U.S. assembly line in Alabama to build C Series planes in partnership with Boeing's archrival Airbus (EADSY).""With this matter behind us, we are moving full speed ahead with finalizing our partnership with Airbus,"" the statement added. ""Integration planning is going well and we look forward to delivering the C Series to the U.S. market so that U.S. airlines and the U.S. flying public can enjoy the many benefits of this remarkable aircraft.""The decision bucked expectations, with a Canadian government source telling Reuters Thursday it expected Bombardier to lose the case, saying ""It is not a multilateral or independent or unbiased tribunal. It's an American tribunal.""Shares of Boeing rose 11 cents 343.22 on the stock market today. U.S.-listed shares of Airbus, which has taken a majority stake in the C Series line, rose 3.3%. Bombardier's shares, which trade over the counter in the U.S., leapt 15.2% to 2.88.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Boeing continued to defend its position after the hearing, despite the overwhelming nature of the ruling.""We are disappointed that the International Trade Commission did not recognize the harm that Boeing has suffered from the billions of dollars in illegal government subsidies that the Department of Commerce found Bombardier received and used to dump aircraft in the U.S. small single-aisle airplane market,"" a Boeing spokeswoman said. ""Those violations have harmed the U.S. aerospace industry, and we are feeling the effects of those unfair business practices in the market every day.""The firm said it will be reviewing the the Commission's more detailed opinions in the coming days, and will continue to document any perceived harm to its business and its U.S. supply chain from what it defines as ""illegal subsidies.""""We will not stand by as Bombardier's illegal business practices continue to harm American workers and the aerospace industry they support,"" the spokeswoman added. ""Global trade only works if everyone adheres to the rules we have all agreed to. That's a belief we will continue to defend.""The dispute began in April last year after Boeing complained about a Delta Air Lines (DAL) order for 75 C Series jets.Boeing has claimed Bombardier sold each 108-133-seat  CS100 for just $19.6 million, arguing they actually cost $33.2 million to make.In September, the Commerce Department proposed a tariff of 219.6% on the Canadian jets, then added an additional 79.8% tariff the following month.In response, Bombardier struck a deal with Boeing's rival Airbus, which saw the European firm take a 50.1% stake in the C Series line for no cash outlay. The aviation giant also plans to open an assembly line in Alabama to build C Series planes for the U.S. market. Bombardier says that will create more than 2,000 permanent U.S. jobs.The trade dispute has spilled over to Boeing's customers.In December, Delta Air Lines snubbed Boeing by placing a massive midsize jet order with Airbus. The airline had been in talks with Boeing about buying around 100 of its 737 Max 10 jets, but opted instead to buy 100 A321neos, worth $12.7 billion at list prices, though airlines typically get steep discounts for major deals.The ruling could also affect sales of Boeing military hardware in the U.K., as 4,200 Bombardier jobs in Northern Ireland could be at risk over the decision.""This is not the behavior we expect from Boeing and it could indeed jeopardize our future relationship with them,"" British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon said last year. The U.K. has a Boeing P-8 maritime surveillance plane on order, along with a fleet of new Apache attack helicopters.In addition, British Prime Minister Theresa May said that she was ""bitterly disappointed"" by the decision to impose tariffs after she had personally asked for President Trump's help in the dispute.Canadian officials also threatened to cancel a planned purchase of 18 Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet jets due to the decision, with officials claiming the C Series supported 23,000 jobs in the U.S. and that the jet's engine is made by United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney unit.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsAirline Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

290,UTX,"THE TAKE-AWAY: What is the Dow Jones industrial average? It gauges the stock performance of 30 really big, household-name U.S. companies deemed to be representative of the U.S. economy.If you watch the news, perhaps you know that the Dow Jones industrial average, or the Dow, is a thing that rises, falls, swoons, surges, plunges, rallies or tanks. When it tanks, it's very bad and very important. It drives men in decorated sport coats, the vibe of which is somewhere between executive and airline captain, to bury their heads in their hands and leave paper all over the floor.You'd be forgiven for not knowing the finer points of what the Dow Jones industrial average actually is. The Dow Jones industrial average is an index that gauges the stock performance of 30 large, well-known companies. A stock index is a compilation of any number of stocks — with different prices, moving in different directions — represented by a single number.You already know many of the stocks that are part of the Dow. Apple (AAPL), Nike (NKE) and McDonald's (MCD) are part of the Dow. General Electric (GE), the last original member, will be replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) on June 26, 2018.Created in 1896 to bring more transparency to the stock market, the Dow intends to offer a big-picture view of how the economic, business and political climate might affect big companies seen as bellwethers for the U.S. economy.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Dow is not a physical place, like a trading floor, where people go to buy or sell stocks. When you see pictures of traders pointing, yelling or despairing, they're probably on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.The ""Dow"" in ""Dow Jones"" is also completely different Dow from the Dow in the chemical giant DowDuPont. However, DowDuPont (DOW) is a Dow Jones Industrial Average stock.A committee made up of three representatives from S&P Dow Jones Indices and two from the Wall Street Journal meets twice a year to consider if any changes are needed to the Dow index.There are no explicit numerical requirements that companies must meet for their stocks to become part of the index. But there are broader, qualitative benchmarks for Dow companies, according to Jamie Farmer, managing director at S&P Dow Jones Indices.A company needs to have a strong reputation, have a history of weathering economic storms, and its shares need to be widely owned by investors, he said. Companies on the Dow also need to get a lot of their sales from the U.S. — at least a plurality, Farmer said. The companies also generally have to trade on the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq.""Dow"" is for Charles Dow. ""Jones"" is for Edward Jones. The two were journalists who founded Dow Jones & Co. in 1882, along with another reporter, Charles Bergstresser. In 1889, they created the Wall Street Journal. On May 26, 1896, the Dow Jones industrial average began measuring stocks — at first, only 12.""Its initial purpose was really just kind of an editorial function,"" Farmer said. ""They wanted a way to describe what was going on in the stock market on a daily basis.""That wasn't always easy in the U.S. stock market's early days.As Charles Geisst's book ""Wall Street: A History"" describes, prices for transactions on the New York Stock and Exchange Board, founded in 1817, weren't always public, let alone available to the area's newspapers.Regulations were also flimsy. Markets were easily manipulated. The 1800s were marked by cycles of wild speculation, panic and bank implosions that swallowed the economy — a process that played out multiple times over the century. Predatory tactics abounded.The daily publication of the Dow Jones industrial average numbers helped investors follow stock market movements more clearly, easing some investor fears, Geisst writes.And just what is the Dow Jones industrial average's justification for being ""industrial"" and an ""average""? That's a little more complicated.When the Dow Jones industrial average first launched, the 12 companies that it tracked were companies in the industrial sector: American Tobacco, Tennessee Coal & Iron, U.S. Leather, U.S. Rubber. General Electric was on there too, initially, before it was removed from the index and later restored in 1907, before ultimately getting removed again in 2018.Many of those companies were broken up, absorbed by others, or morphed into different businesses over time.In the beginning, the Dow was a pure ""average"" of the stocks in it. The prices of those 12 stocks were added up, divided by 12, and then you got the singular price for the whole thing.Today, that's not the case. The Dow uses a mechanism called a ""divisor"" to help calculate that singular, representative price of the index's stocks. The divisor is there to smooth out the bumps in price that come from things like stock splits or the addition or removal of stocks from the index. The Dow is also price weighted, meaning higher-priced stocks have a bigger influence on the index than lower-priced ones.Over the decades, the Dow has become less ""industrial,"" per se, though it includes big names like GE, 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX). But the index has evolved to include large tech and financial-services players, which are more representative of the economy today.In the prior tweak, DowDuPont replaced DuPont in Sept. 1, 2017, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, after it merged with Dow Chemical.Before that, Apple replaced AT&T (T) on March 19, 2015. And on Sept. 23, 2013, Goldman Sachs (GS) replaced Bank of America (BAC); Visa (V) replaced Hewlett-Packard, which split up; and Nike (NKE) replaced Alcoa, which also split up.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:What Is The Stock Market And How Does It Work?

292,UTX,"Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and other top Pentagon contractors will benefit from a huge bump in military spending under the $1.3 trillion fiscal 2018 budget that President Trump signed Friday, just hours after threatening to veto it.Lawmakers have earmarked $654.6 billion for the Pentagon, an increase of $61.1 billion from the 2017 budget, as global tensions increase in North Korea, Russia, China and the Middle East.The House passed the legislation late Wednesday, and the Senate passed it in the early morning hours on Friday. But Trump tweeted later today that the budget didn't fully fund a border wall and lacked a resolution for the DACA program, which he moved to end last year. He signed it anyway, citing national security priorities.Missile defense will get $11.5 billion, an increase of $3.3 billion from the fiscal 2017 budget and more than the $9.5 billion the Missile Defense Agency requested. The figure includes the $2 billion appropriated in December as part of a special supplemental budget deal.The MDA will get $393 million to speed up Boeing's modernization of the kill vehicle in 20 Ground-Based Midcourse Defense System interceptors in Fort Greely, Alaska.Under the proposed budget, Congress approved 24 new Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets, 10 more than the Navy requested.There are also funds for three more Boeing KC-46 tankers, on top of the 15 the Air Force requested. The over-budget and behind schedule tanker has come under fire the past year. Boeing has booked $2.9 billion before taxes, or $1.9 billion after taxes, in charges for cost overruns associated with the tanker, which is based on a 767 airframe.The Army will get $577 million for 17 Boeing AH-64E Apache helicopters, and the Navy will get $501 million for three more Boeing P-8 maritime surveillance aircraft.Boeing shares closed up 0.4% on the stock market today, paring intraday gains sharply after sinking 5.2% Thursday as concerns about a trade war with China hurt prospects for the company's commercial aircraft business.Congress approved $2.9 billion for 20 more F-35s, bringing the total for this fiscal year to 90 planes.The Navy will get eight more of the carrier variant of the fifth-generation jet and the Marines will get four more short take off/vertical landing F-35s as well as two carrier versions. The Air Force didn't get its entire wish list, but will get 56 F-35s in total, just four shy of its 60 request.Northrop is a major subcontractor on the F-35, and United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney unit makes the engine.The proposed budget now includes $165 million for more Lockheed Terminal High Altitude Area Defense interceptors along with $178 million for Raytheon (RTN) SM -3 interceptors and $137 million for another test of Raytheon's SM-3 Block IIA missile. Both interceptors are for use in Lockheed's Aegis Ashore system.The bill also included 12 more Lockheed C-130J Super Hercules planes for the Air National Guard and the Army National Guard got $108 million for eight Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters.Lockheed rose 2.8%, Northrop gained 2.1%, while United Tech fell 1.4%.Along with the increase in F-35s, Congress approved $84 million for six more Northrop MQ-8 Fire Scout unmanned helicopters.The Navy will get $23.8 billion for shipbuilding, up by $2.6 billion from 2017.

293,UTX,"Dow Jones industrial average component General Electric (GE) reports results Friday for the last quarter presided over by CEO Jeff Immelt. Peer Honeywell (HON) reports the same day.XLong seen as a bellwether for the U.S. economy, GE has seen that image come under a cloud as GE stock languishes near 2015 levels while stocks of peers such as Honeywell, 3M (MMM) and United Technologies[ticker symb=UTX] flirt with all-time highs.GE is the second-worst performer on the Dow so far in 2017, while 3M and United Technologies are enjoying double-digit gains.Investors will be closely watching top-line results, where growth has been elusive for both GE and Honeywell in recent quarters. They also will be hoping GE's report puts it on the path of becoming a turnaround under John Flannery, who becomes the industrial titan's first new CEO in 16 years on Aug. 1.Industrials is the only S&P 500 sector that has seen estimates for second-quarter earnings growth tick up since the start of the quarter in April. Still, it is expected to report tepid 3.1% earnings growth vs. 8.1% for the S&P 500 overall as of July 14, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Analysts at CFRA describe the outlook for the industrial conglomerates subindustry as neutral.""We think industrial activity metrics indicate the industrial economy continues to experience modest expansion and that the global economy is likely to continue to be relatively tepid in 2017,"" CFRA equity analyst Jim Corridore wrote recently.Here is what to watch when GE and Honeywell report. GE's Dow peers United Technologies and 3M are on the dock July 25.Estimates: Earnings per share to decline 51% to 25 cents as revenue drops 13% to $29.12 billion, according to consensus analyst estimates from Zacks Investment Research. The revenue drop reflects divestitures in part.Stock: Shares were down 0.2% at 26.77 on the stock market today, after rebounding 2.4% last week from a 21-month intraday low on July 10.What to watch: Analysts pay attention to organic revenue, which filters out divestitures and some other noise, along with industrial orders. Both of those metrics have been weak in recent quarters.Cash flow will be in focus after spooking investors in the last report. Does GE's big buyback program make sense given weak cash flow?Investors will want to hear about GE's oil and gas segment following that segment's July 7 merger with oil service giant Baker Hughes and Immelt's recent downbeat comments. Are GE's jet engine and other aviation assets performing well, following positive rumblings during the Paris air show? GE's jet engine comments also will be noteworthy for United Technologies, with its big Pratt & Whitney jet engine division.Does GE's 2018 earnings goal of $2 a share still look like a stretch? GE could choose to lower its guidance to clear the decks for new CEO Flannery.Is General Electric on track to reach a $1 billion cost-cutting goal?Estimates: Honeywell is expected to post a 6.6% gain in EPS to $1.77 as sales dip 1.6% to $9.83 billion.Stock: Honeywell stock was down 0.15% Tuesday, dipping below buy range after rising 1.3% last week and setting a record high Friday.What to watch: The performance of its aerospace unit, which an activist investor has pushed to be spun off, given Honeywell recent cautions about corporate and defense demand for jets.RELATED: Fastenal Growth Accelerates, But Industrial Distributors Dive Once AgainNetflix, Microsoft, GE, Lockheed To Amp Up Earnings: Investing Action PlanBig Hits And Misses Of The Current Earnings Season

295,UTX,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) raised its full-year guidance Tuesday as increased F-35 sales helped lift second-quarter earnings and revenue well above estimates.XThe defense giant now sees full-year earnings per share of $12.30-$12.60, up from a prior view of $12.15-$12.45 but with the new midpoint still below the $12.54 consensus. Revenue is now seen at $49.8 billion-$51 billion, up from a prior view of $49.5 billion-$50.7 billion and with the new midpoint above the $50.56 billion consensus.For Q2, EPS slipped 2.7% to $3.23 but beat Wall Street views for $3.09, while revenue rose 9.6% to $12.69 billion, above estimates for $12.47 billion.Rotary and mission systems sales, which include the Sikorsky helicopter unit, rose 3.2% to $3.41 billion. Space systems sales rose 8.7% to $2.41 billion. Missiles and fire control sales dipped 2.6% to $1.64 billion. Aeronautics sales grew 19% to $5.23 billion, with the bulk of that gain from higher net sales of about $525 million for the F-35.Lockheed is ramping up production of the F-35 as orders grow. Deliveries from the ninth production batch started in Q1 and continued into Q2. A contract for the 10th production batch was signed earlier this year, with deliveries expected to start next year.On July 7, Lockheed was awarded a $5.6 billion deal to continue work on the 11th batch, while the Pentagon works on a final contract expected by the end of the year.But higher costs continue to haunt the program. Acquisition costs will increase by $27.5 billion, to $406.5 billion, according to a Pentagon report submitted to Congress earlier this month, as the Air Force cuts the number of F-35A models procured yearly to 60 from 80, reducing efficiencies gained from larger buys.But the F-35 joint program office has said prices negotiated with Lockheed and engine maker United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney unit ""continue to be below SAR estimates.""Shares fell 0.6% to 286.68 on the stock market today.

But the Pentagon refuted that figure.Trump has been the biggest critic of the F-35 and vowed to get a better deal from Lockheed and look at more Boeing (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornets for the Navy instead to cut costs.Boeing shares climbed 0.8% to 203.96, further extended out of buy range and hitting a new record high intraday.United Technologies rose 0.4% to 123.06, also hitting an all-time high intraday.RELATED: Amid New Russia Threat, Lockheed's F-35, F-22 May Face Biggest Test Yet

301,UTX,"After taking heat for years over its ballooning acquisition price tag, Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 is reportedly under scrutiny now for the cost to operate and maintain the new stealth fighters.XThe cost to procure 2,443 F-35s for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy is about $400 billion. Meanwhile, the cost to operate the fleet over the course of its decades-long service life is estimated at $1.2 trillion.But the Pentagon's chief weapons tester has warned that figure is ""likely to increase significantly"" because the F-35's parts are more unreliable than expected and repairing the jets are taking longer than planned, according to Bloomberg.In a May presentation, the Pentagon's director of operational testing told officials that reliability metrics on ""critical failures have worsened over the last year."" And reliability metrics have fallen again since the May 8 presentation for the Air Force's F-35A and Marine Corps' F-35B variants. But metrics rose for the Navy's F-35C version, according to the report.The availability of spare parts is ""is getting worse, affecting fly rates"" in the more than 200 F-35s based across the U.S. Additionally, 20% of F-35s needing parts have to wait as suppliers struggle to keep up with replacing damaged parts while concurrently boosting production to accommodate the ramp-up of deliveries of new F-35s, according to the presentation.Spare part issues have weighed on fleetwide availability of F-35, which is at just 52% — well below the current goal of 60% and the 80% needed for combat testing expected to start next year.But F-35 Joint Program Office spokesman Joe DellaVedova told Bloomberg that the program is seeing a ""positive effect"" from improved spare-part forecasting and repair times.Lockheed shares rose 0.8% to 280.09 on the stock market today, bouncing higher from a test of their 50-day average but still in buy range. Northrop Grumman (NOC), a top subcontractor on the F-35, climbed 0.9% to 257.52, also still in buy range. United Technologies (UTX), whose Pratt & Whitney unit makes the F-35's engines, advanced 0.7% to 122.46, rising further above its buy zone.The F-35 program has already been struggling against availability issues. All F-35s were grounded earlier this month at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona because some pilots suffered oxygen deprivation issuesAnd last week, all Marine F-35s were grounded at Yuma Air Station in Arizona over software issues with its critical Autonomic Logistics Information System, which is needed for everything from mission planning to maintenance.RELATED: Amid New Russia Threat, Lockheed's F-35, F-22 May Face Biggest Test Yet

302,UTX,"The Air Force has filed a report on restarting production of Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-22 Raptor, and backers of the stealthy air-superiority fighter got shot down.The Obama administration canceled the program in 2009 amid spiraling costs, and the Air Force has maintained for years that restarting the program would be too expensive. It reiterated that stance Wednesday.The Air Force said buying 194 additional F-22s would cost about $50 billion, which includes $9.9 billion for non-recurring start-up expenses and $40.4 billion for aircraft procurement. The price tag for each F-22 to be $206 million-$216 million.""The startup costs are significant and very expensive,"" Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson told reporters, according to the Washington Examiner. ""The chief has assigned a fighter roadmap. Our plan is to put any resources we have into that roadmap and not into restarting a line from an older aircraft.""Amid concerns that U.S. aircraft might lose their ability to dominate the airspace as Russian and Chinese rivals make advances, Congress asked the Air Force last year to produce a report on resurrecting the F-22.Lockheed shares edged up 10 cents to 282.99 on the stock market today, just within buy range of a 270 entry.The F-22 program produced 187 operational planes, less than half the 381 that the Air Force requested.The $200 million-plus unit cost for a new F-22 compares with the $140 million per-plane cost when production ended. Meanwhile, Lockheed is working to push costs of the F-35A, the basic model ordered by the Air Force and most international partners, to under $80 million per plane in 2019 or 2020, down from $95 million under the latest contract.A 2011 RAND study put the cost of building 75 more F-22s at $13.7 billion-$17.4 billion in 2008 dollars, depending on a variety of factors. Earlier this year, United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney division said it could start building the F119 engines for the F-22 by December 2020.Instead of restarting the F-22, the Air Force has said it wants to focus investments on its three priorities: Lockheed F-35 fighters, Northrop Grumman (NOC) B-21 bombers and Boeing (BA) KC-46 tankers.RELATED: Amid New Russia Threat, Lockheed's F-35, F-22 May Face Biggest Test Yet

304,UTX,"X After months of secrecy, Boeing (BA) will provide an update at the Paris Air Show Tuesday on a completely new midmarket plane that's meant to counter Airbus' (EADSY) A321neo.Earlier this year, reports said the new plane, which has been dubbed the 797 by some analysts, would have two aisles, carry 200-275 passengers up to 5,000 nautical miles, and be available by 2024-25.But Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg told Bloomberg TV Monday that the plane is ""potentially twin-aisle,"" but the company is still looking at ""all options.""He did confirm, however, that the new plane would seat roughly 250 passengers and have a range of 5,000 nautical miles.Still, Boeing has indicated it is in no hurry to finalize details, despite suffering market-share losses in recent years to the A321neo, which has allowed airlines to open new routes that aren't accessible with smaller planes and aren't profitable with larger ones.Kevin McAllister, head of Boeing Commercial planes, told reporters Sunday that there is a gap in the middle of the market, but that the company's focus is on putting together a business plan and taking its time ""to do it right.""Boeing shares climbed 1.3% to 199.08 on the stock market today, hitting a new all-time high of 199.47 intraday. U.S.-listed shares of Airbus were up 1.5%, also at record levels.The interest in the midrange market has soared in recent years as carriers shy away from widebody jets. Boeing's new 737 Max 10, which was officially unveiled Monday, is seen as a stopgap to keep the A321neo at bay until the 797 is ready.Boeing has spent three years talking to United Airlines (UAL), Air Lease (AL) and other potential customers about the 797 as it looks to take back market share from the A321neo.But Airbus is getting ready for Boeing's new plane. The European company is reportedly working on a bigger variant of the A321 that would have new wings and a longer cabin and seat more than 240 passengers, vs. the 180-240 capacity for the A321. It would also fly farther than the A321's maximum range of 4,000 nautical miles.Meanwhile, engine makers are already battling it out for a spot in the 797.General Electric (GE) Aviation President David Joyce told Bloomberg Monday that GE wouldn't build engines for the 797 if rivals United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce were allowed to as well.Joyce said the company still has ""scars"" from being one of many engine suppliers on the Airbus (EADSY) A330 plane.""What happens is, all three of us spend a lot of money to design a brand-new engine and then all of a sudden you're splitting the market,"" Joyce said. ""You look at the returns on that and, unless you find a bunch more applications for that engine immediately, you end up in a world where it just doesn't work.""GE shares fell 0.7% to 28.80.

306,UTX,"The 30-year General Electric (GE) veteran poised to take over as the industrial conglomerate's chief executive promised Monday to review every part of a vastly simplified but sprawling portfolio — and the division he currently heads could be next on the GE chopping block, in one analyst's view.John Flannery, president and CEO of GE Healthcare, told analysts on a conference call that he expects to put each component business under the scanner as he prioritizes capital allocation decisions in his new role. An analyst on the call said that could ironically spell trouble for GE's health care unit, which the company itself describes as a core business.""As GE pares down, it's the one business that looks like an outlier,"" Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets told IBD. ""It has big market share and visibility, but at the end of the day, it's not big infrastructure, it's not big heavy iron like locomotives or engines. It has different demand drivers and the fact that (Flannery) ran them does not exclude potential divestiture.""The division, which includes diagnostic imaging and life sciences, also does not have recurring, high-margin service revenue — as aircraft engines do, for example — and health care faces regulatory pressures, Dray pointed out.In his view, Flannery's prior experience leading GE's business development team, which seeks out M&A deals, would make him ""readily adept at maximizing value and structuring potential exits"" — as Flannery did through the 2015 acquisition of Alstom's power and grid business.Shares of GE jumped 3.6% to close at 28.94 on the stock market today, retaking their 10-week moving average for the first time since late April. The stock got a further lift as GE management said it expects this quarter's results to show an improvement over the previous and year-ago quarters as it reaffirmed its 2017 outlook.Among other industrial conglomerates, United Technologies (UTX) dipped 0.6% to 119.88 to re-enter buy range, Honeywell (HON) eased 0.4% to 133.26 but remains near a 135.20 buy point, while U.S.-listed shares of German rival Siemens (SIEGY) dropped 2%.A divestment of GE's health unit would follow outgoing CEO Jeff Immelt's efforts to shed the company's financial and media units and bring it back to its industrial core, which include the power, aviation, energy and transportation segments.But other analysts don't see much more unloading of business units and instead expect a heightened focus on long-term strategy execution.""In a conglomerate like GE, some parts of the portfolio will always be up for review, but I don't expect large-scale shedding (of business units), to be honest,"" said Morningstar equity analyst Barbara Noverini. ""The company has the building blocks in place to generate healthier earnings than in the past.""Despite Immelt's efforts at streamlining GE, the Dow stock has been under pressure lately, sliding roughly 11% year to date through Friday vs. 9% gains for both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average. Activist investor Nelson Peltz of Trian Partners reportedly pushed for Immelt's departure earlier this year. In an email Monday, Trian said it had no comment on the leadership change.Research firm CFRA kept its buy rating on GE stock after the announcement. ""We think GE remains on the right track with its strategy and expect share performance to improve in the coming year,"" said CFRA analyst Jim Corridore.RELATED:5 Red Flags From This GE Warning That Sent The Stock To 15-Month LowsWhy General Electric May Miss This Key Earnings Goal Next Year

307,UTX,"General Electric (GE) on Wednesday announced more business and executive changes, spurring talk of a potential ""brain drain"" similar to what was seen at the industrial conglomerate after its last CEO switch 16 years ago.GE will roll its legacy power and energy connections businesses into one unit called GE Power. The current head of the power business, Steve Bolze, is leaving. He has been with GE for 24 years and led the takeover of Alstom's power and grid unit — the biggest industrial acquisition in GE's history.Russell Stokes, a 20-year GE veteran and the current head of the electrical connections unit, replaces him starting July 3.Bolze's departure has echoes of the exodus of senior managers after Jeff Immelt was named CEO in 2000, said analyst Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets, noting that Bolze is believed to have been on the list of potential candidates to succeed Immelt.The 2000 transition resulted in the ""immediate bitter"" departure of the losing CEO contenders, such as Bob Nardelli, then-CEO of GE Power Systems, and Jim McNerney, then-head of GE Aircraft Engines, Dray said in a statement. (Nardelli went on to helm Home Depot (HD) and then Chrysler, while McNerney took over at 3M (MMM) and later Boeing (BA).)""That said, it is possible that the brain drain this time will be limited,"" Dray continued. ""We note that the other leading candidate for the role, CFO Jeff Bornstein, was appointed vice chair of GE on Monday, supposedly in lieu of the CEO position.""Shares of GE, a Dow Jones industrial average component, edged up 0.8% to 28.69 on the stock market today, closing just below its 50-day line. GE stock surged on Monday, when Immelt's retirement was announced, its largest gain of the year so far. But the stock is mired 13% below its July 2016 high.Among other industrial conglomerates, United Technologies (UTX) fell 3 cents to 120.03, just in range from a 114.54 buy point. Honeywell (HON) dipped 0.1% to 134.24, just below a 135.10 buy point.U.S.-listed shares of German rival Siemens (SIEGY) rose 0.1%.IBD'S TAKE: GE shares are having a strong June so far after three down months, but this is why GE is not a buy yet.Despite Immelt's upcoming retirement, incoming CEO John Flannery is expected to build on the strategy of infusing core units like aviation, power systems, transportation and energy with technology, which began under Immelt and has been generally praised.Still, GE's transformation into a digital-industrial company during Immelt's leadership has done little for the stock, which sits at around 28 — roughly where it was more than two years ago.GE stock has posted an annual average 5.2% gain in the past two years through Tuesday, roughly half that of the S&P 500 over the same period.RELATED:Stocks Flatten Ahead Of Fed, But Dow Etches New HighGE Signals New CEO Will Continue Software Push Started By Immelt
"
308,UTX,"General Electric (GE) is staying the course on its digitally driven strategy started under outgoing CEO Jeff Immelt, as the Dow component on Tuesday unveiled a suite of Big Data tools and software that can transform how companies manage and service their machinery.At an event in Berlin, the industrial heavyweight unveiled digital products that allow utility companies, wind farms and oil drillers to analyze machine data in real time, identify leakages, enhance forecasts, increase productivity and even create new business opportunities.GE said the new offerings could help customers predict potential problems rather than merely react to them, thereby reducing costs and eliminating idle time.GE on Monday announced its first new leader in 16 years after nearly a decade of shedding its finance and media businesses and infusing core units like aviation, power systems, transportation and energy with technology.Underpinning these efforts is the company's Predix cloud-based software platform, a key initiative of Immelt that outfits industrial machinery with sensors that collect and monitor data, which can then be analyzed both on job sites and through remote servers. GE estimates the so-called industrial internet will be a $225 billion market by 2020, fueling massive gains in productivity and innovation.GE Vice Chair Beth Comstock told reporters in Germany that the company won't retreat from its software push under John Flannery, who will take over as CEO on Aug. 1.""I don't know how you don't go digital as an industrial company,"" she said, according to Bloomberg. ""John Flannery knows this firsthand. He's very aware of what's happening in other businesses. He's not in isolation.""In addition to GE's traditional industrial rivals, tech giants like Oracle (ORCL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) are eying the industrial internet as well, though GE is partnering with them too.Shares of GE closed down 1.7% at 28.45 on the stock market today, dropping back below their 50-day line and reversing an early gain. The stock surged 3.5% in massive volume Monday on news of the leadership change. Despite significant changes to GE's strategy in recent years, its stock has been stagnant for roughly two years.Among other industrial conglomerates, United Technologies (UTX) edged up 0.15% Tuesday and still in buy range, Honeywell (HON) inched up 0.85% to 134.39, closer to a 135.20 buy point, and U.S.-listed shares of German rival Siemens (SIEGY) added 0.5%.RELATED:This 'Outlier' GE Unit May Ironically Be Ripe For Sale Under New CEOWill Microsoft Cloud GE's Industrial Internet Hopes?

309,UTX,"General Electric's (GE) chief executive suggested clouds hang over the company's earnings outlook for next year, saying volatility in energy commodities poses a significant challenge to core GE businesses such as oil and gas, power and transportation.""Pricing is still tough"" in the resources market, CEO Jeff Immelt said Wednesday at the Electrical Products Group Conference in Florida.An EPS goal of $2 for 2018 is at the high end of expectations ""assuming the markets don't get better,"" he added.Tough equipment pricing and political volatility are additional headwinds for GE, weighing on the outlook for its industrial and health care segments, Immelt warned.His comments sent shares of GE down 1.6% to 27.83 erasing early gains on the stock market today. The stock had rebounded for the prior four sessions. On May 18, shares intraday matched their lowest level since October 2015.GE's relative strength line, which tracks the stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is even worse. That RS line is at its lowest point since the early 1980s.Immelt is under pressure from an activist investor to improve performance at the industrial bellwether. Nelson Peltz of Trian Partners had reportedly pushed for Immelt's departure earlier this year, insisting the company could earn $2.33 a share next year if it met cost and sales goals. But after some discussions with Trian, GE said in March it would tailor this year's bonus program to the company's ability to meet profit targets and a new cost-cutting goal.Against that backdrop, the chief executive was eager on Wednesday to spotlight recent efforts to narrow the company's scope — actions that he pitched as stoking organic growth and cash flow.""We've made more big portfolio changes over the last three years than at any time in the company's history,"" Immelt said. ""The focus now is to wheel into execution.""The company's recent deals for Baker Hughes (BHI) and French energy company Alstom are part of what Immelt described as a ""much simpler, much deeper portfolio"" focused on businesses with big moats.The company also has disposed off several smaller or underperforming businesses. Those changes put it on track to deliver 3%-5% organic growth, a 100 basis-points margin expansion and 80% to 90% free cash flow conversion, Immelt said.Still, GE stock is one of the worst performers on the Dow Jones industrial average so far this year, down 12% year to date. Only Verizon Communications (VZ) has fared worse, down 16%.By comparison, GE rivals such as Siemens (SIEGY), Honeywell International (HON) and United Technologies (UTX) each flourish double-digit gains year to date, with their stocks trading at or near 52-week highs.RELATED:5 Red Flags From This GE Warning That Sent The Stock To 15-Month LowsThese 2 Industrial Bellwethers Topped Earnings, 1 Hit A Buy PointDow's General Electric Spikes On Report CEO Jeffrey Immelt On 'Hot Seat' With Key InvestorDow Stock GE May Have Headed Off Activist Investor Fight With This Move

310,UTX,"Honeywell (HON) touted its aerospace business as being ""in a great position in a growing industry,"" amid pressure from an activist investor who argues it would perform better as a spinoff.In a presentation at the Electrical Products Group conference in Florida Tuesday, Honeywell said increasing global flight hours, new aircraft ramping up and improving worldwide defense budgets offer ""further runway"" for margin expansion.Honeywell's aerospace investments totaled $2.5 billion in 2016 and are expected to climb in 2017. Over 15% of Honeywell sales are channeled into aerospace research and development — two times as much as its closest rivals, the company said.However, Third Point's Dan Loeb has said the aerospace unit has been a laggard relative to industry peers and that a spinoff would boost stock valuations and increase shareholder value by more than $20 billion.Honeywell had already been conducting a strategic review of its portfolio and said Tuesday it is ""modeling various scenarios,"" with its assessment to wrap up by this fall.Honeywell stock rose 1 cent to 131.85 in afternoon trade on the stock market today, still in buy range after clearing a 127.62 entry last month. Among other big industrials with aerospace businesses, General Electric (GE) climbed 0.35%, United Technologies (UTX) edged up 0.3%, and Rockwell Collins (COL) lost 0.1%.New leadership at Honeywell may work in Third Point's favor, according to RBC Capital Markets, which said in a note last month that ""new CEOs are often more willing to rethink an organization's portfolio."" Darius Adamczyk took over as Honeywell's CEO and president in April.Honeywell, which makes airplane engines and other aircraft parts, cut its full-year sales forecast in January, citing weaker demand in corporate jets amid global trepidation about the economy and less traction in defense.However, the supplier to Boeing (BA) and Airbus (EADSY) beat first-quarter earnings expectations last month. But the aerospace segment's revenue slipped 4% to $3.55 billion, while overall sales were flat at $9.49 billion.RELATED:A Honeywell Aerospace Spinoff Could Hinge On ThisActivist Investor Third Point Urges Honeywell To Spin Off Aerospace UnitDow Stock GE May Have Headed Off Activist Investor Fight With This Move

United Technologies, whose Pratt & Whitney unit makes the plane's engines, dropped 1.6%, re-entering the high end of its buy zone. Northrop, a major F-35 subcontractor, dipped 0.1% to 247.18 but still near a 249.53 entry.As tensions heat up in the region, Germany could be the next NATO ally to buy the F-35 outside current NATO partner countries like the U.K., the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey and Italy.According to a Reuters report Wednesday, the German air force requested classified data on the F-35 as it looks to start replacing its older fourth-generation jets between 2025 and 2035.

312,UTX,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 flew close to the Russia border last month as a show of force, but Pentagon officials said Monday they aren't concerned about adversaries obtaining any intelligence about it during the stealth fighter's public display.Several of the Air Force's F-35A variants were deployed to RAF Lakenheath in the U.K. in April and were later sent to Estonia, which borders Russia, and Bulgaria, which is across the Black Sea from Russian forces in Crimea, as part of the European Reassurance Initiative, a program for placing U.S. forces in the region that began after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea.When asked about security issues related to flying the F-35 so close to Russia, Pleus said that while pilots are always nervous about adversaries gleaning information from the plane, the Pentagon has ""procedures available"" to prevent that from happening.""We have in place through a partner of networks proper procedures for us to make sure we can fly the airplane when we want to, in places that we want to, and that people cannot collect information off of the F-35,"" Brig. Gen. Scott L. Pleus, director at the F-35 Integration Office, told a group of reporters Monday.He wouldn't go into the types of procedures, saying they were classified. The last of the F-35s returned to the U.S. on May 9, and officials from Hill Air Force Base are scheduled to give more details Wednesday about its first deployment to Europe.Lockheed shares closed 0.4% higher at 272.36 on the stock market today. United Technologies (UTX), whose Pratt & Whitney unit makes the plane's engines, edged up 0.1%.

313,UTX,"General Electric (GE) shares hit a 15-month low after receiving a downgrade to sell from hold from Deutsche Bank, which cited a range of issues for the industrial giant, including cash flow pressure to a potential leadership change.""Overall, we believe GE to be overvalued given weak earnings quality and the wide gap between noncash and cash earnings,"" wrote Deutsche Bank analyst John Inch, who cut his price target on the company to 24 from 28.The core industrial business appears to be struggling, added Inch, who estimates that excluding GE Capital dividends and proceeds from divestitures, ""GE does not appear to be generating sufficient cash flow to sustain its operations.""""We believe GE's cash challenges are ultimately grounded in GE's profile as a manufacturer of 'big iron' capital goods that require high levels of investment and spending to develop and manufacture,"" he wrote.Inch also said GE's ""weak cash flow has become worse in recent quarters,"" noting that it could threaten shareholder returns.""While GE is going to realize cash inflow from business sales (ie, Water, Industrial Solutions) and ongoing PPE (property, plant and equipment) divestitures, the company appears to be operating relatively 'close to the line' in terms of sufficient cash generation to continue to fund such a robust dividend and share repurchase program,"" he warned.Deutsche Bank doesn't see leadership changing anytime soon — and if CEO Jeffrey Immelt does get the boot, Inch warned that ""the next CEO could opt to significantly reset earnings targets lower: possibly closer to actual cash generation.""""In turn, we expect the market could be negatively surprised by this prospective reset,"" he postulated.Immelt is under scrutiny by Trian Partners' Nelson Peltz. The activist investor has reportedly been displeased with the GE head's performance.Deutsche Bank said GE's $31 billion in underfunded pension obligations seems high and ""could be considered a long term cash call on the company,"" adding that the company will contribute $1.8 billion to its pension plan in each of the next two years.GE's ""inexplicably low"" tax rate could actually be a risk, Inch said. If the White House and Congress can manage to revamp the tax code, GE is unlikely to benefit, given that its tax rate is already below what its peers are paying. And if the tax code were simplified and loopholes closed, that could lift GE's taxes.GE shares fell as low as 27.85, closing down 2.1% at 28.27 on the stock market today.

""If the delays do stretch and cause incremental delays in the program (which we view as a low probability), we wanted to highlight the importance of the 737 to the industry and specifically our universe. Note that the 737 tends to be a high margin program for many suppliers and is a source of significant free cash flow for Boeing and many suppliers, such as Ducommun (DCO), Spirit AeroSystems (SPR) and Hexcel (HXL).  So while we view the risk of significant delays here as limited, it is risk to watch, and the initial delays can turn out to be more serious than anticipated.""RELATED:Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

321,UTX,"XLate-session declines whittled Wednesday's moderate gains to a weak finish.Earnings disappointments were the leading culprit, gnawing away at the week's early momentum and grinding the Dow Jones industrial average's early 0.4% gain to a 0.1% decline. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq also shredded their gains, the Nasdaq ending flat and the S&P 500 down less than 0.1%.All the indexes remained firmly positive for the week.Compared to busy sessions Monday and Tuesday, Wednesday's action was comparatively quiet, with preliminary data showing trade slightly higher on the NYSE and slightly lower on the Nasdaq.At either end of the Dow industrials, United Technologies (UTX) rose nearly 2% and Procter & Gamble (PG) dropped 2%, both on quarterly results. United Tech remained in a buy range, 3% above a flat base buy point of 114.54. More than half of the Dow's stocks traded higher, with Verizon (VZ), Home Depot (HD) and Travelers (TRV) also posting gains of around 1%.Edwards Lifesciences (EW) easily led the S&P 500, pulsing more than 10% higher after reporting that strength in U.S. heart-valve replacements helped power a 32% first-quart earnings gain and a 27% rise in sales. Both numbers clobbered analyst expectations. The move hoisted shares back above the 40-week moving average as Edwards works on the right side of a six-month consolidation.Gains were more modest on the Nasdaq, led by a 3% advance by Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH). The gain put shares narrowly above a 52.60 buy point in two-month long a flat base.The low end of the Nasdaq was a different story, with Seagate Technologies (STX) gouging out a 16% loss.

322,UTX,"Dow Jones industrial average component Boeing (BA) has racked up more than $2 billion in extra costs on the KC-46 tanker for the Air Force, but the aerospace giant has learned key lessons from the military program's headaches and integrated them into its commercial aircraft business.The tanker, which is based on a modified 767 airframe, is now in production but ran into delays for development of its refueling boom, wing-mounted air refueling pods, and wiring. CEO Dennis Muilenburg said the company has used those lessons to help deliver the 737 Max ahead of schedule and under budget as well as get the 787-10 into flight testing a month early.""For the first time, we're building a military product, highly modified, in our commercial product line, and we see huge cost advantages to bringing that capability in line in our production models,"" Muilenburg said during the company's conference call. ""But around the edges of that, things like systems installation, wiring installation, the details that go into concurrently designing and building and how to do that most efficiently.""Lessons from the KC-46, which saw $120 million in extra costs in Q1, come as Boeing considers building a brand-new midrange plane dubbed the 797. Boeing has been under pressure to develop a new twin-aisle jet to grab market share back from Airbus and its A321neo jet.As a stopgap measure before the midrange jet launches, Boeing plans to extend its largest 737 Max to limit further losses to Airbus. The so-called 737 Max 10 could be unveiled at the Paris Air Show in June, sources told Reuters.Muilenburg didn't say Boeing's experience with the KC-46 would feed directly into the 797 and 737 Max 10 and declined to offer any details about them, such as the price tag, despite reports of carriers wanting a new plane at around $70 million-$75 million. But he did say Boeing is having productive conversations about the business case for each option.""Our primary focus is engaging with customers and understanding their future needs,"" Muilenburg said.Boeing shares were down 1% to 181.71 on the stock market today, pulling back further from a 185.81 buy point, as Q1 revenue missed forecasts. Rival Airbus (EADSY) dipped 0.6% despite securing a $6 billion deal for 20 A350-900 widebody jets from China Southern Airlines.Boeing's core EPS jumped 16% to $2.01, beating analyst views for $1.95. Revenue fell 7% to $21 billion, under views for $21.35 billion. Commercial revenue dipped 1% to $14.3 billion, as commercial aircraft deliveries fell to 169 from 176 a year ago. Defense revenue declined 18% to $6.5 billion.Total company backlog was $480 billion, up from $473 billion at the start of the quarter. Free cash flow soared to $1.63 billion from $527 million a year ago.Boeing raised its full-year adjusted EPS guidance to $9.20-$9.40, with the midpoint still below Wall Street views for $9.35, from an earlier outlook of $9.10-$9.30, due to a lower-than-expected tax rate.Muilenburg reiterated the company's stance on supporting tax reform and simplifying the tax code hours after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed that President Trump's tax cut, with a 15% corporate tax rate, will be ""the biggest in history.""Muilenburg, who seems to have the president's ear on key issues, said Boeing has seen regulation improvements from the streamlining of defense contracting to improvements in the time it takes to get approval for foreign sales.On the defense side, Boeing has been pushing to build an upgraded F/A-18 Super Hornet to stay relevant in the defense air frame space as sales of its F-15 wind down and is in the race against Lockheed Martin (LMT) for the Air Force's T-X trainer contract.On Tuesday, Lockheed reported mixed Q1 results, and the F-35 maker lowered its full-year earnings outlook but slightly raised its revenue view. Raytheon (RTN) is scheduled to report Thursday.Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD), which both topped earnings estimates Wednesday, were little changed and up 0.9%, respectively. United Technologies (UTX), whose Pratt & Whitney unit makes jet engines, climbed 1.2% on strong Q1 results.Lockheed shares edged up 0.1% to 270.33 after falling 2.2% to 270.02 on Tuesday.

Volume was mildly higher on the NYSE vs. the same time Tuesday and slightly lower on the Nasdaq. The 30-component Dow Jones industrial average, at 20,974, is now up 6.1% year to date. That trails the Nasdaq's 12% gain, but is ahead of the Russell 2000, which rallied 0.6% late Wednesday but trails with a 4.5% gain since Jan. 1.In the 30-stock Dow, at least three names gained 1 point or more, including Travelers (TRV) and United Technologies (UTX). The latter, up more than 8% past a 109.52 cup-with-handle breakout point, reported thin gains in Q1 earnings and revenue.Go to a weekly chart of United Tech, and you'll see that the stock can also be seen as still forming an aircraft carrier-sized saucer base stretching to its February 2015 peak of 124.45.From that perspective, one could argue that another handle formed on this extremely long base with an additional buy point of 114.54, 10 cents above the March 1 intraday high.United Tech CEO Gregory Hayes noted that all four main businesses saw top-line growth, driven by 3 percentage points of organic growth and 1 point of net acquisition growth, offset by a 1% drop related to currency flows. Otis brand elevator and related equipment orders rose 11% excluding China.Amid the selling carnage seen in U.S. Steel (X) shares following its poor quarterly revenue, the steel sector actually does not look so bad when viewed through the prism of U.S. Steel's more highly rated rivals, Nucor (NUE) and Steel Dynamics (STLD).Both of these stocks rebounded sharply off intraday lows and kept their heads above the 50-day moving average. This is key, as IBD research of the best stock market winners over the past century shows that a true market leader trades above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages ahead of a possible breakout from a well-formed historical chart pattern, including the cup-with-handle, the double-bottom and the flat base.Nucor, up 2% to 62.15, is less than 9% below a recent high of 68 and is building a new base. The RS Rating of 71 is below the ideal minimum of 80 on a scale of 1 to 99, but it's moved up from 51 just two weeks ago.Last week, Nucor posted a 304% leap in first-quarter earnings to $1.13 a share, its biggest year-over-year increase in more than four years, as revenue accelerated 30% higher to $4.82 billion. Nucor's after-tax margin soared to 7.5% vs. 2.4% in the year-ago quarter.Steel Dynamics on April 19 posted a fifth quarter in a row of excellent profit growth, with EPS rising 215% to 82 cents on a 36% gain on the top line to $2.37 billion. That was the highest quarterly sales since the fourth quarter of 2014. Steel Dynamics is fashioning a new base that shows many jagged edges — one of the telltale signs of investing in commodity-linked companies. In many cases, the right time to buy such a stock is not at the primary breakout but possibly during the first pullback following the breakout.Elsewhere in the market, keep an eye on top names in the gaming industry. IBD's Leisure-Gaming group has trampolined up to 24th from 80th six weeks ago, as seen in IBD's daily ranking of 197 industry groups based on six-month relative price performance.Watch for Las Vegas Sands' (LVS) first-quarter results after the market close on Wednesday. The Street sees earnings rising 38% to 62 cents a share, which would be the best bottom-line result since a 78% jump in the third quarter of 2013.The stock, up 1.5% on Wednesday in strong turnover, is fashioning the right side of a potential new saucer base with a 63.38 high. For now, the base shows a 63.48 entry.Sands' arch rival Wynn Resorts (WYNN) saw a 3.5% drop in Q1 revenue from its Macau-related business. That was offset by a 6% rise in revenue from its Las Vegas casino hotels.Wynn shows a better RS Rating than Sands at 85 vs. 64, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup.

327,UTX,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) became the latest company to come under attack by President-elect Donald Trump, who criticized the defense giant's F-35 stealth fighter program for having ""out of control"" costs.It came a week after he vowed to cancel Boeing's (BA) Air Force One replacement planes, citing the cost.The cost to develop and build the F-35 is about $400 billion, and the program is perennially under fire for cost overruns and delays. The Pentagon is buying more than 2,400 F-35s for the Air Fore, Navy and Marine Corps, and U.S. allies will buy hundreds more.In a tweet Monday, Trump was hammered to program for escalating expenses.The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2016In an appearance on Fox News Sunday, Trump reiterated his attack on Boeing and said the F-35's cost is ""out of control.""""We welcome the opportunity to address any questions the president-elect has about the program,"" said Jeff Babione, Lockheed's F-35 general manager, on Monday.He added that the company has reduced the price by more than 70% and predicted it will reach $85 million per plane by 2019-2020. In addition to the acquisition cost, Lockheed is also working on reducing the F-35's operating and sustainment costs, he said.Shares of Lockheed fell 2.4% to 253.23 on the stock market today, but rebounding from a low of 245.50 and closing above their 50-day average. Northrop Grumman (NOC), which is a major subcontractor on the F-35, retreated 2.7%, closing near session highs but just below its 50-day line.

""Presumably he won't comment on all defense contracts but will focus on high profile programs. However, given his power as president, this can have an impact on specific programs.""But even if Trump restricts himself to a ""bombastic Twitter shoutout,"" a tougher stance could still affect defense stocks, Cowen added.Among other defense giants, Raytheon (RTN) was down 1.7% Monday, closing above its 50-day. General Dynamics (GD) fell 0.9%.Trump has already taken on Ford (F) and United Tech's Carrier unit for moving production to Mexico. And on Wednesday, he is due to meet executives from Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA), among other tech leaders, in New York.The tech industry largely supported Hillary Clinton in the election, and Trump has attacked the sector for relying on overseas production.RELATED:Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon Get TrumpedApple, Google Set For Trump Tech Summit

329,UTX,"U.S. arms sales overseas could crush records in fiscal year 2017 after the State Department cleared helicopter, missile and other military sales to allies in the Middle East. But President-elect Trump's anti-Muslim rhetoric could weigh on future sales to the region.On Thursday the State Department approved a possible sale of 37 Boeing (BA) Apache helicopters to the United Arab Emirates along with engines and other spare parts for an estimated $3.5 billion, according to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency.An estimated $3.51 billion order for 48 Boeing Chinook helicopters, related equipment, training, and support was approved for Saudi Arabia.Other major deals approved included an $108 million deal for TOW anti-tank missiles to Morocco and United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney F117 engines and logistic support to Qatar.The approvals totaled $7.9 billion, bringing the Defense Security Cooperation Agency's total notifications to $41.8 billion in less than three months into fiscal year 2017, easily beating the $33.6 billion the agency reported last year. Earlier this year the White House approved sales of Boeing's F-15s and F/A-18 Super Hornets and Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-16s to allies in the region.With the fighter and helicopter sales, the figures are on track top a record $46.6 billion in sales set in 2015, but the recent approvals don't mean the sales are done deals yet.Boeing shares rose 0.7% to 156.49 in the stock market today, the highest since February 2015. United Tech climbed 1.25% to 109.79, moving back above a 109.52 buy point. Lockheed shares rose 0.1% to 259.53 after sinking 2.7% on Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: Boeing's defense unit is getting boost from international orders. As well as the F-15s and F/A-18 Super Hornets approved for the Middle East, last month Canada said it would buy more Super Hornets to replace its aging fighters and Boeing is still in hunt for fighter sales to India. While a Trump presidency is largely seen as good news for defense stocks, his calls compile a registry of Muslim immigrants and other diplomatic issues could affect sales to the Middle East.David Melcher, chief executive of the Aerospace Industries Association said at an industry lunch Tuesday that there were ""concerns"" with sales to allies in the Middle East as the potential for foreign sales are always tied to a relationship with the U.S. and that ""military sales will follow diplomatic overtures.""Lower oil prices could also put pressure on weapons orders from the Middle East.RELATED: Trump Seeks To Cancel Air Force One Order, Targets Boeing ProfitLockheed, Northrop, Raytheon Get TrumpedDespite Closer Russia Ties, Turkey Orders More F-35s; China Debuts J-20

330,UTX,"President-elect Donald Trump told NBC Wednesday that he would negotiate lower prices for Air Force One replacement planes with Boeing (BA) or else cancel the program.""That's what I'm here for,"" he said on the Today show. ""I'm going to negotiate prices. The planes are too expensive. We're going to get the prices down. And if we don't get the prices down, we're not going to order them. We're going to stay with what we have.""During the interview, Trump said he had spoken to Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg on Tuesday about the costs of the new presidential planes after tweeting in the morning that he should cancel the order, saying ""costs are out of control, more than $4 billion.""Boeing said it's currently under an initial contract for $170 million to determine the capabilities for the Air Force One replacement planes. The Air Force said Tuesday it budgeted $2.7 billion for the two 747s but expects ""this number to change"" as the program matures.The Government Accountability Office has put the eventual cost at $3.2 billion between fiscal years 2010 and 2020, the AP said, and an Air Force official told NBC News that the price tag is expected to top $4 billion when the planes are delivered.Boeing shares rose 1.25% to 154.14 in the stock market today, hitting their highest level since April 2015 after closing fractionally higher on Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: While Trump's tweet initially hit Boeing shares on Tuesday, his agenda while in office could kick off a lasting stock market rally.Getting directly involved in specific deals is unusual for a president but Trump has made headlines for inserting himself in public companies' affairs.He apparently convinced Ford (F) to keep a small SUV production line in Kentucky open and used a combination of threats and state tax incentives to get United Technologies' (UTX) Carrier unit to keep a plant open in Indiana.Ford shares climbed 4% to 13.06, moving above their 200-day line and hitting their best level since late July. United Tech shares were up 2% to 109.63, closing just above a 109.52 buy point.RELATED: Trump Sold Boeing, Apple, All Other Stocks In JuneDrug Stocks Topple On Donald Trump's Pledge To Bring Down Drug PricesTrump Targets Drug Prices, Apple, Seeks '5 Minutes' With Offshoring FirmsBoeing Sees Tax Incentive Remaining Despite WTO Ruling

332,UTX,"The stock market took off thanks to President-elect Donald Trump's agenda of corporate tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation, but the latest headlines signal a likelihood of turbulence ahead as investors examine what JPMorgan analysts call ""radical changes.""CNN on late Wednesday reported that top players in the incoming administration have been kicking around the idea of imposing an across-the-board 5% tariff on imports. Alternatively, team Trump has been weighing support for a House Republican corporate tax change that would indirectly apply a 20% tax on imports, even though it might not pass muster with the World Trade Organization.Trump aides Thursday responded to the CNN report, stressing that no decisions have been made.""The CNN story got a little bit too far out over its skis,"" Trump transition spokesman Jason Miller told reporters. ""The incoming administration is obviously discussing numerous trade deals and tax reform packages with members of our own team as well as members of Congress. But it's too early to go into specific speculation on issues of tariffs or border adjustability.""The report followed the announcement that economist Peter Navarro, who has defended Trump's campaign threat to slap a 45% punitive tariff on Chinese imports, will head a soon-to-be-established White House National Trade Council.On Thursday, shares of major retailers were taking it on the chin. Wal-Mart (WMT) was off 2.3% on the stock market today. Macy's (M) slid 3.6%, Target (TGT) 4.4%, Gap (GPS) 5.4% and Dollar Tree (DLTR) 5.65%. E-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN) fell 0.55%. (Retailers also fell on reports of weak holiday sales and traffic).One of the big questions since the election is how Trump will merge his populist campaign themes with a traditional Republican agenda of tax cuts and deregulation. A boost to infrastructure spending and use of the bully pulpit to keep companies like Ford (F) and Carrier, a unit of United Technologies (UTX), from shutting down U.S. production are two clear ways that Trump aims to stay faithful to his working-class supporters who put him over the top in the Rust Belt. Demanding that Mexico and Canada open up North American Free Trade Agreement for renegotiation is another likely tack. Yet the latest reports offer the clearest indication that Trump may go further than investors have been expecting.It's easy to see why investors are excited about the prospect of a big corporate tax cut. Trump's campaign plan to cut the corporate rate to 15% from the 35% statutory rate could boost S&P 500 earnings by $180 billion, or 16%, figures Jonathan Glionna, head of U.S. equity strategy research at Barclays.IBD'S TAKE: Stocks that stand to benefit from both corporate tax cuts and an infrastructure boost have been among the big winners of the Trump rally. Two of those stocks, Freeport McMoRan and Martin Marietta Materials, are near a buy point. Check out Leaderboard, where IBD's market writers help you find buying opportunities in these and other stocks as they emerge, as well as sell signals to lock in profits.But some companies and sectors could stand to benefit much more than others. Domestic-focused industries like retail and homebuilders, many of which derive 100% of income from the U.S., could see an earnings boost of 30% or more, Glionna wrote, and could get a further boost from a consumer tax cut. Dollar General (DG), for example, could see its 37% effective tax rate (including state taxes) fall to 17% under the Trump plan.Among industry groups, only telecom would get a bigger lift than retail, with AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ) seeing a 29% boost in earnings.Yet, retailers could, all of a sudden, become big losers if Trump adopts the House Republican plan. While cutting the statutory corporate tax rate to 20% from 35%, the House plan would no longer allow businesses to deduct the cost of imports from taxes. That means retailers such as Dollar General, Wal-Mart, Amazon, Costco (COST) and Starbucks (SBUX) would have to pay a tax equal to 20% of the cost of the clothing, televisions, toys and coffee they import.Because retail profit margins are generally in the low single digits, one concern is that retailers that sell a lot of imported goods might have to pass much of those taxes on to customers to maintain their profitability.""Clearly a 20% tax on the wide range of consumer goods that are imported into the United States would put increased economic pressure on families who can least afford it,"" the National Retail Federation said after the House unveiled its ""Better Way"" tax plan in June.Actually, the economic impact of the House plan is far from clear. While imports could be 20% more expensive and exports 12% cheaper, the dollar could appreciate by 15% or more, largely offsetting the tax changes, Deutsche Bank wrote in an analysis this week.Trump and the GOP could be in for a big battle if they build corporate tax reform around this border-adjustment plan. Yet, reform may not be much easier if they choose another path. The conservative Tax Foundation estimates that this border adjustment of corporate taxes would raise $1.1 trillion over 10 years, a huge sum that helps offset the cost of lowering the corporate tax rate to 20% in the House plan. Unless the GOP can get eight Senate Democrats on board, which is doubtful, a tax package passed via reconciliation will have to be deficit-neutral beyond 10 years, so offsets are needed to make the U.S. tax code more competitive.On top of that, there are real worries that other countries will punish American companies if the Trump administration applies tariffs or Congress adopts what looks like a border tax.It's probably safe to say that the stock market rally has downplayed some of these nagging problems in implementing the Trump agenda and that the ride may get bumpy because the range of possible outcomes is wide.As JPMorgan analysts wrote this week, ""While a lot of the early corporate tax reform enthusiasm was predicated on a cursory examination of the headline rate cuts, markets are now examining the radical changes being proposed to the intricacies of the code. (Last) Thursday and Friday saw notable weakness in apparel/retail-linked stocks and a big factor behind the selling was concern around the border adjustment concept that sits at the heart of the GOP corporate tax reform plan.""RELATED:Here's How Much Trump Tax Cuts Could Boost The Stock Market Tax Reform May Pit GOP Vs.

333,UTX,"President-elect Donald Trump vowed to cancel Boeing's (BA) Air Force One deal Tuesday, saying its profits shouldn't be too high, after targeting plans by Ford Motor (F) and United Technologies (UTX) to use factories in Mexico. Boeing later reportedly expressed a willingness to negotiate. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016Shortly after that tweet, Trump told reporters in the Trump Tower lobby, ""The plane is totally out of control ... We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money.""David Melcher, CEO of the Aerospace Industries Association trade group, tried to play down Trump's threat, telling reporters ""what is tweeted today is not necessarily going to be the policy of tomorrow,"" but said today's tweet needs to be addressed by the transition team.He added that his advice to AIA members is to not tweet back.The White House said the figures that Trump cited don't match the arrangement between Boeing and the Pentagon. The Air Force has previously designated $1.65 billion for two new planes. Boeing also responded that it is currently under an initial contract for $170 million to determine the capabilities for Air Force One replacement planes.""We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best plane for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer,"" Boeing said.But the Government Accountability Office put the eventual cost at $3.2 billion between fiscal years 2010 and 2020, the AP said, and an Air Force official told NBC News that the price tag is expected to top $4 billion when the planes are delivered.Boeing has reached out to Trump transition officials saying that the cost of the new Air Force One plans could be lowered if the government reduces its stringent requirements, Bloomberg reported late Tuesday, citing sources.Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James told Politico that Air Force One is a ""flying White House.""Lee added, ""There's (electronic) countermeasures built in, communications, very high level communications, security of all types. After all, this is carrying the president of the United States. It has to go long distances, it has to survive under difficult circumstances, much more difficulty than a normal civilian airliner.""Boeing shares closed up less than 0.1% at 152.24 on the stock market today after sinking as low as 150.02. On Monday, Boeing hit a 19-month high of 153.75 intraday. U.S.-listed shares of European rival Airbus (EADSY) retreated 1% Tuesday.""While we appreciate the enthusiasm we've seen expressed on social media for Airbus products and their value proposition, it would be inappropriate for us to comment or speculate on the future plans and policies of the next administration,"" and Airbus spokesman said.IBD'S TAKE: Boeing's defense unit is getting boost from international orders. In September the White House approved sales of its F-15s and F/A-18 Super Hornets to allies in the Middle East and last month Canada said it would buy more Super Hornets to replace its aging fighters.Trump has already used the Twitter (TWTR) bully pulpit aggressively before taking office.He apparently convinced Ford to keep a small SUV production line going at a Kentucky plant. Last week, he used a combination of threats and state tax incentives to get United Technologies' Carrier unit to keep open one Indiana plant, saving close to 1,000 jobs.Boeing is one of the companies most vulnerable to any global backlash to Trump micromanagement and protectionist measures.China has already threatened to shift orders from Boeing to Airbus if Trump enacts anti-China measures. And Trump may go after Boeing and other big defense contractors. The Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35 fighter is far over budget, while a recent report said the Pentagon is hiding some $125 billion in bureaucratic waste.Lockheed shares fell 0.35% to 266, hovering just below a 267.03 buy point.RELATED: Trump Sold Boeing, Apple, All Other Stocks In JuneBoeing Sees Tax Incentive Remaining Despite WTO RulingTrump Touts Carrier Deal, Says Companies Leaving U.S. Face 'Consequences'Tax Reform May Pit GOP Vs.

334,UTX,"The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index surged to a 10-year high in December, as confidence in the outlook got a jolt from the presidential election and the subsequent stock-market rally.Economic Optimism rose 3.4 points to 54.8, the highest since November 2006, remaining above the neutral 50 level for the third straight month.While confidence in the economy had been on the upswing before the election, the surprise victory of Donald Trump, part of a clean sweep for Republicans, had a huge effect on Americans' economic expectations. The effect was far more positive than negative, but economic sentiment tends to be partisan, and that's never been more clear than in this month's poll.Optimism about the six-month economic outlook rocketed to 86.6 among Republicans from 50.9 just before the election, hitting the highest level since the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index was launched in 2001. Independents' view of the six-month outlook jumped 12.7 points to 58.5, highest since January 2004. But sentiment among Democrats plunged 32.1 points to 28.2, lowest since October 2008, just before Barack Obama was elected.Economic data have been trending positive, with the jobless rate sinking to 4.6% in November as the economy added 178,000 jobs. But no economic news has gotten as much attention as Trump's intervention last week that caused Carrier, a unit of United Technologies (UTX), to cancel plans to move an Indiana factory to Mexico.On Tuesday, Trump tweeted that he wants a Boeing (BA) order for new Air Force One planes canceled. Boeing shares fell 1.5% intraday, but closed up 8 cents at 152.24 on the stock market today.Before those events, Ford Motor (F) said it was calling off plans to shift production of the Lincoln MKC to Mexico from Louisville, Ky.IBD'S TAKE: Optimism is running high over Donald Trump's agenda of lower taxes and more infrastructure spending, yet there are three big factors that could limit what he can accomplish: 1) High deficits and strict budget rules; 2) A tight job market; and 3) A possibility of rising trade tensions that could backfire on U.S. employers.The Economic Optimism Index is a composite of three major subindexes that track views of near-term economic prospects, the outlook for personal finances over the coming six months and views of how well government economic policies are working.All three major subindexes rose this month.The six-month optimism gauge climbed 4.1 points to 56.3, a big recovery after sinking as low as 36.7 in July.The personal financial outlook index rose a modest 0.9 point to 59.8, but remained the highest of the three subindexes.The measure of confidence in federal economic policies got the biggest lift from the election, jumping 5.2 points to 48.3, highest since August 2007.Overall, economic optimism jumped 3.6 points to 55.6 among self-described investors, the highest since January 2007. Trump's agenda of cutting personal and corporate taxes, along with a burst of infrastructure spending, have helped fuel a stock market rally since Nov. 9. That rally, which has aided infrastructure-related firms over big-cap techs such as Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB), is both a reflection of and fuel for positive investor sentiment. Among non-investors, optimism rose 3.5 points to 54.1.Beyond the divergence in optimism along political lines, there were also clear differences along racial and geographic lines.Optimism fell 7.2 points to 51.2 among urban dwellers, while jumping 5.1 points to 54.9 among suburbanites and surging 11.7 points to 58.4 among rural dwellers.Optimism jumped 7.5 points to 56.3 among whites, while falling 8.8 points to 50.1 among blacks and Hispanics.The IBD/TIPP Poll of 902 Americans was conducted from Nov. 28-Dec. 4 via live interviews of people with landlines and cellphones. It has a margin of error of +/- 3.3 percentage points.RELATED:IBD/TIPP Poll: Economic Optimism IndexTrump Tweets: Japan's SoftBank To Invest $50 Billion In U.S.Trump Touts Carrier Deal, Says Companies Leaving U.S. Face 'Consequences'Tax Reform May Pit GOP Vs.

"
335,UTX,"In the tweet heard round the world, Donald Trump threatened to slap a 35% tariff on companies that shift jobs overseas, then ship their goods back to the U.S.Since his election, the focus has been on the carrots Trump will offer to grow and protect America's manufacturing base: corporate tax cuts and possibly a side order of state tax incentives. That's the menu that will keep open a Carrier plant in Indiana slated for closure by United Technologies (UTX).But now Trump is signaling a more combative approach, talking loudly about the big stick he will use to punish companies that turn their backs on U.S. workers.""The U.S. is going to substantially reduce taxes and regulations on businesses, but any business that leaves our country for another, fires its employees, builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the U.S. without retribution or consequence is WRONG! There will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35% for these companies,"" Trump wrote in a series of tweets on Sunday morning.Trump had threatened Carrier air-conditioner units and Ford Motor (F) autos with such a tariff during the campaign, but applauded both companies after the election for keeping jobs in the U.S.There's little doubt that Trump's unprecedented use of the Twitter (TWTR) bully pulpit will strike fear in the hearts of industrial firms thinking about offshoring production to save on labor costs. The real question is what the consequences of his heavy-handed approach may be for U.S. companies and the American economy. Economists, politicians and trade analysts unloaded a barrage of criticism, suggesting that Trump's effort to kneecap offshoring could injure the U.S. economy.Yet several things are working in Trump's favor, and that may be why the major stock indexes took Trump's tweets in stride and continued to push higher on Monday, with the Dow industrial average hitting a new all-time high. For one, the carrots Trump is offering are a big deal, which is why President Obama could never have intervened to keep factories from leaving the U.S. if he had been so inclined.Reducing the 35% statutory federal corporate tax rate to 15%, as Trump hopes to do, is a gift that manufacturers thinking of offshoring production hadn't been counting on. The other positive is that the long, shallow recovery after a deep recession means that momentum for outsourcing is probably waning.On the other hand, shares of Rexnord (RXN), which Trump criticized for its plans to move ball-bearing production from Indiana to Mexico and put 300 people out of work, slipped 1.1% on the stock market today, their third straight decline on high volume.There are legitimate concerns about how Trump will seek to make good on his threats. The hope, presumably, is that Trump won't be forced to use his bazooka because companies will see more downside than upside in waging a public battle against the White House.Trade analysts have argued that Trump has no legal authority to impose a 35% tariff of individual companies, so it's certainly possible that a company could sue the White House and win. But that doesn't mean any company will want to be in such a position.University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers tweeted that Trump's tariffs could put U.S. businesses at a competitive disadvantage: ""Notice that U.S. firms that build overseas plants face tariffs. Foreign firms that build overseas plants do not. This is bananas.""While corporate tax reform would work in the other direction, continued appreciation of the dollar vs. foreign currencies would, as economists generally expect, further disadvantage U.S. producers.IBD'S TAKE: As markets assess how Trump's trade policies will work out, U.S. industrial companies that get most of their revenue at home are among the biggest post-election winners, including Nucor, Steel Dynamics and Martin Marietta. Check out IBD Leaderboard to track which stocks are leading the market.The other threat for U.S. multinationals is that other countries will hold Trump's trade policies against them. Already, China has warned that it could shift its Boeing (BA) business to Airbus and impede sales of the Apple (AAPL) iPhone if Trump carries out his campaign threat of a 45% tariff on Chinese imports. Trump, though tweeting over the weekend that China has devalued its currency, so far hasn't repeated that threat as president-elect. If he does, count on markets to react.There are two other big wild cards related to trade relations. The New York Times reported last month that some countries, including Mexico and Canada, are considering the possibility of imposing tariffs on the U.S. if a Trump administration backs out of the Paris climate agreement signed by President Obama.Finally, the House GOP tax reform plan, which Trump has not yet commented on, would put a 20% tax on the value of imports while making exports out of the U.S. tax-free. Such an approach would face a challenge before the World Trade Organization and would likely increase global trade tensions.RELATED:Trump Touts Carrier Deal, Says Companies Leaving U.S. Face 'Consequences'Tax Reform May Pit GOP Vs.

The small cap Russell 2000 led with a 0.4% gain and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average was flat. Volume in the stock market today fell sharply across the board.Winners and losers were mixed, with the postelection uptrend looking tired. In the IBD 50, banks and financials were mostly down. Technology stocks, which were hammered Thursday, had some rebounds but others scored some additional losses. Among stocks attracting heavy volume, Ulta Beauty (ULTA) dropped about 1%.After Thursday's close, the company delivered a three-sided beat. Results topped views on earnings, revenue and guidance.One possible reason for the stock-price drop might have nothing to do with Ulta or its earnings. The Retail-Specialty group is a laggard, rating No. 148 among 197 industry groups. For a stock to advance, a tailwind from its group is a critical component. Lone-wolf winners exist but are rare.Blue chips were mostly up, but the gains were generally small. The day's biggest pop on the Dow belonged to United Technologies (UTX), up 1% in slow trade.

337,UTX,"As president-elect, Donald Trump is pro-business and a champion of corporate tax cuts — not to mention, anti-free trade and a big-company bully.That's a disorienting mix for chief executive officers trying to suss out whether Trump in the White House will be a blessing or bad luck. Planning ahead is no easy task when the next commander in chief is a guy with a hair-trigger Twitter finger who touts policies that could both help and hurt U.S. companies. Many said in interviews that they're cautiously optimistic — and a tad nervous.""I've got a great deal of confidence with the new administration coming in,"" Manny Chirico, CEO of apparel giant PVH Corp., said on Bloomberg Television, adding in the next breath, ""You have to be concerned about some of the talk and the rhetoric on trade.""The challenge is anticipating what Trump will do once in office. Will he crack down on immigration, dealing a blow to labor markets for restaurants, retail and construction? Hike tariffs on foreign-made goods and exit trade deals, which would be a hit to companies from Apple (AAPL) to Nike (NKE)? Push to slash tax rates and ease regulations, things business tends to like?""I don't think anyone has any idea what to expect,"" said David Yermack, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business. ""Companies have to make educated guesses about what may happen when, but there's a huge amount of uncertainty.""Prepping for Trump's four years has added a new plank to public-relations strategy and the assessment of reputational risk. At PR firm Weber Shandwick, Liz Cohen, an executive vice president for financial communications, said she's advising clients to perform vulnerability analyses just as they would for outspoken activist investors.""Clearly, in this environment, it's important companies take a look at what parts of the business could be criticized,"" Cohen said.Such is the power of the Trump Twitter feed, with its 17.3 million followers. He's been using it to harass companies just as he did Hillary Clinton and his GOP primary rivals. A CEO can be thrust into the news cycle with no warning.""That's a little bit unnerving,"" said Southwest Airlines' (LUV) Gary Kelly. ""There is some volatility there. We just don't know where the bully pulpit is going to come from.""Lockheed Martin (LMT) was a recent target, slammed in a tweet for what the president-elect said were out-of-control costs for the F-35 fighter jet. The immediate fallout was painful, with the tweet sending the stock down 2.5% and erasing almost $2 billion in market value.In fact, Trump's gripe with Lockheed caused drops in other defense contractors, which had been rallying in anticipation his administration would boost defense spending, considering he said when he was campaigning that he wanted to beef up the number of U.S. troops, ships and warplanes.Whatever the industry, ""a lot of guys are thinking, 'Oh man, I don't want him tweeting about me and my company,""' said Ken Lowe, chief executive of Scripps Networks Interactive (SNI), which owns lifestyle-oriented websites and cable-television channels. And there's no telling who Trump will assail next.""A lot of us also think, 'That's one day. What's he on to tomorrow?'"" said Lowe.General Electric's (GE) Jeffrey Immelt said many chief executives would gladly accept fleeting bad publicity in exchange for the tax reform and job creation the next president may bring. Immelt said he's not worried about getting in the man's cross hairs — and that he keeps a sharp eye on @realDonaldTrump.""Sure,"" he said with a laugh during an exchange last week with reporters in New York. ""Who doesn't?""Bosses should totally get what Trump's doing when he calls a company on the carpet, because it's what so many of them do within their own operations. He's acting just like a CEO, Lowe said, by publicly asking, ""Why are you spending so much money?""In the corporate world, ""it's been an effective strategy,"" said Davia Temin, founder of the crisis-management company Temin & Co. ""It will be a fascinating experience to see how things that have worked inside global organizations translate to the political arena.""For all that, the victim of a Twitter pounce must be careful, she said.""Never start a press war with someone who can outgun you,"" Temin said. ""A CEO could choose to have a battle of the titans and fight back. That is a strategy, but not one I'd recommend.""Boeing (BA), another recent mark, certainly didn't take that road. In fact, according to people familiar with the matter, Boeing executives reached out to transition-team members to tell them the Air Force One price tag Trump had complained about could be lowered — if the government reduced the requirements. The company said CEO Dennis Muilenburg had spoken with Trump and was committed to keeping the project as affordable as possible.That's the kind of outcome, squishy as it is, that Trump can trumpet as a victory. There was a similar result after he hammered United Technologies (UTX) during the campaign for its plan to move some U.S. jobs to Mexico in its Carrier unit. Postelection, Carrier made a deal to keep an Indiana factory open with more than 1,000 employees in exchange for tax incentives provided by the state — whose governor is Vice President-elect Mike Pence — while still sending jobs to Mexico.Some executives profess not to be sweating it all.""We're not big enough to be on that radar screen,"" said Wendy's (WEN) CEO Todd Penegor. Maybe, but Trump has gone small too, even badgering a local union representative in Indiana.Asked if presidential unpredictability will make it harder to run a business, Lululemon Athletica (LULU) CEO Lauren Potdevin said only time will tell. The company generates about 70% of its revenue in the U.S. But as Potdevin took pains to point out, it's based in Vancouver, British Columbia, in a country not ruled from the White House.""Being a Canadian brand is awesome,"" he said. ""Everyone loves Canada.""
"
338,UTX,"Donald Trump on Thursday touted his deal with United Technologies (UTX) unit Carrier to keep more than 1,000 jobs in Indiana from leaving for Mexico, thanks to new tax incentives.President-elect Trump as well as Vice President-elect and current Indiana Gov. Mike Pence spoke at an Indianapolis plant that will now stay open. Trump said he had told United Technologies' CEO that the jobs couldn't leave the state and that he and Carrier came to an agreement.""Companies are not going to leave the United States anymore without consequences,"" Trump said Thursday. ""Leaving the country is going to be very, very difficult.""Under the deal, 1,100 jobs there will be saved out of 1,400 originally set to be cut. Another Carrier plant in Indiana will still close, affecting 700 workers. The air conditioner and heating products maker will get $7 million in state tax breaks over 10 years. In return, Carrier will invest $16 million on its Indiana operations.Carrier's decision to move jobs to Mexico earlier this year caused an uproar, especially when a worker's smartphone video of the announcement went viral.Trump had said during the presidential campaign that he he would bring Carrier to heel. On Thanksgiving he said on Twitter (TWTR) that he was ""making progress"" with Carrier. Trump and Carrier confirmed a deal had been reached late Tuesday.Carrier reportedly had been offered state incentives previously. Parent company United Technologies may have decided that accepting the latest offer was a good way to win goodwill with the incoming administration and the general public. United Tech has major defense and other contracts with the federal government.United Technologies shares fell 0.2% to 107.48 on the stock market today. On Wednesday, shares rose to 110 intraday, briefly topping a 109.52 buy point, but closed down 1%.Offering tax breaks and other incentives to attract or keep companies is a time-honored tradition by state and local governments. Trump's move will likely endear him to core supporters, who see someone acting decisively to save manufacturing jobs and using his Twitter bully pulpit to help out the little guy.But economists and fiscal conservatives say specific tax breaks are not a good subsititute for business-friendly policies. If businesses make decisions not based on what's best for growth and profits but satisfy political leaders, that's an environment that would lead to weaker hiring and economic growth overall. Others note that tax breaks encourages corporations to threaten to pull up stakes to win subsidies.Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who also had criticized Carrier's plans during his campaign for the Democratic nomination, said the company took Trump ""hostage and won.""United Technologies took @realDonaldTrump hostage and won. That should make all workers across the country nervous. https://t.co/lULg3y3SGX— Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) December 1, 2016Trump did say that America's high U.S. corporate tax rate discourages companies from operating here. Trump has proposed cutting the federal rate to 15% and encouraging a repatriation of some $2 trillion in corporate profits kept offshore, giving companies more of a reason to invest and operate at home.Soon after Trump's election win, he tweeted that he had convinced Ford Motor (F) not to close a Kentucky plant. Ford later clarified that it had decided not to shift a small SUV from that plant to Mexico, but there were never any plans to shut down the facility itself.Trump had harshly criticized Ford's decision to move small car production to Mexico and threatened punitive tariffs. Keeping an SUV line in the U.S. once again may have been a relatively low cost way to appease the incoming president.Will Apple (AAPL) be next? Trump had said he would bring Apple iPhone production back to the U.S. or impose big tariffs on China-made iPhones. Apple contractor Foxconn reportedly has looked into shifting some work to the U.S. That would raise costs on Apple and consumers, though adding some small amount of assembly work might not have a huge impact.RELATED:Trump Claims Twitter Win On Indiana Jobs; Carrier Stresses State IncentivesTrump Makes 'Progress' On Indiana Carrier Plant, Using Twitter Bully Pulpit

342,UTX,"President-elect Donald Trump reached a deal  late Tuesday with United Technologies (UTX) unit Carrier to keep nearly 1,000 jobs at an Indiana plant that had been scheduled to shift the work to Mexico.But it appears that Trump, who had made threats during the campaign, used a combination of carrots and sticks in his team's negotiations with United Tech.Carrier said late Wednesday that state incentives were an ""important consideration"":""Today's announcement is possible because the incoming Trump-Pence administration has emphasized to us its commitment to support the business community and create an improved, more competitive U.S. business climate. The incentives offered by the state were an important consideration.""The quasi-public Indiana Economic Development Corporation reportedly is offering modest tax breaks to Carrier. Tax breaks are an old staple for states and cities to attract and retain businesses and jobs, though critics say they often are not economically or fiscally sound.However, John Mutz, an ex-Indiana lieutenant governor who's on the IEDC, told Politico that Carrier had rejected a similar offer before. Mutz think that parent United Technologies is worried about losing big federal contracts. United Technologies' Pratt & Whitney jet engine unit has several defense-related pacts, for instance.Carrier tweeted late Tuesday that it would keep nearly 1,000 of the 1,400 jobs scheduled to be cut at itsIndianapolis plant.

348,UTX,"After riding a wave of working-class support to the White House, Donald Trump is hanging ten in Indiana today, celebrating the neat trick he pulled off in getting Carrier, a unit of United Technologies (UTX), to keep nearly 1,000 jobs that were headed for Mexico.But the big question is what Trump and the GOP will do for an encore. In particular, how will they pull off corporate tax reform that's in tune with their populist moment?The path for tax reform put forward by House Speaker Paul Ryan and fellow House Republicans would appear — at least at first blush — to offer a clear answer: taxing imports but not exports, in a reversal of current policy that imposes corporate income taxes on exporters but not overseas producers with goods bound for the U.S.Proponents go so far as to suggest that this is a neat way for Trump to shift the tide of trade without provoking a trade war by slapping punitive tariffs on goods from China and Mexico.While the economic impact of the proposal is much more complicated, the immediate fate of the House GOP tax reform may rest on what Trump's working-class supporters find more alarming: anti-competitive U.S. tax policy or higher prices at Wal-Mart (WMT).The National Retail Federation has begun sounding the alarm about the House GOP plan released in June, when a clean sweep in the election for Republicans seemed like a distant long shot.Here's why retailers are girding for a fight: While cutting the statutory corporate tax rate to 20% from 35%, the House plan would no longer allow businesses to deduct the cost of imports from taxes. That means retailers such as Wal-Mart, Amazon (AMZN), Costco (COST), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Starbucks (SBUX) would have to pay a tax equal to 20% of the cost of the clothing, televisions, toys and coffee they import.Because retail profit margins are generally in the low single digits, retailers that sell a lot of imported goods would have to pass those taxes onto customers to maintain their profitability.IBD'S TAKE: Donald Trump made a lot of promises during the campaign. Here's what President Trump could accomplish in his first 100 days.It's not clear whether Trump is on board with the House plan. His own plan called for cutting the corporate tax rate to 15%, low enough that corporations wouldn't go out of their way to avoid U.S. taxes.Yet, it's important to understand the House proposal to grasp the direction and limits of the tax reform effort on which the GOP is about to embark.Here are six key points:The U.S. corporate tax system is a mess and definitely needs fixing. The clearest evidence is that U.S. companies such as Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are holding more than $2 trillion in profits overseas to avoid taxation in the U.S.The House wants to tax profits where goods and intellectual property are sold, rather than where profits are earned, which is a much fuzzier concept that's vulnerable to gaming. For example, companies have an incentive to overstate costs incurred by domestic operations to reduce their U.S. tax bills, shifting more profits to overseas subsidiaries, where they'll be taxed at a lower rate.For years, Republicans have talked about shifting the U.S. to such a territorial system, where the U.S. no longer taxes foreign earnings, but Democrats have warned that such a move could increase the incentive for offshoring. Ryan & fellow Republicans would avoid such an outcome by changing the tax code to keep companies from deducting the value of imports from their new, lower 20% income tax rate.There's another big reason, beside protecting U.S. producers, that the House GOP relied on this indirect tax on imports: the budget. The conservative Tax Foundation estimates that this border adjustment of corporate taxes would raise $1.1 trillion over 10 years, a huge sum that helps offset the cost of lowering the corporate tax rate. Unless the GOP can get eight Senate Democrats on board, which is doubtful, a tax package passed via reconciliation will have to be deficit-neutral beyond 10 years, so offsets are needed to make the U.S. tax code more competitive.Although it seems logical that hiking taxes on imports and reducing taxes on exports could shift the balance of trade, economists say that won't happen, at least not on a sustained basis. If the U.S. starts running a lower trade deficit due to tax policy, the value of the dollar would rise relative to other currencies, negating any advantage gained. Further, assuming currencies adjust as the change is phased in, the impact on retailers and their customers would be far less than feared.Still, economists generally favor a reform that taxes consumption where goods are sold and expect a payoff from less tax evasion. But there's a big question about whether the House GOP tax reform would comply with World Trade Organization rules. University of Maryland professor Peter Morici, who served as chief economist at the U.S. International Trade Commission, tells IBD that the House plan seems to violate WTO rules requiring nondiscrimination in the tax treatment of imports relative to domestic goods. While the outcome can't be known until a trade case is litigated, other analysts have also raised questions. Morici thinks Republicans would be wise to adopt a value-added tax instead, while junking the corporate income tax, but no one in the GOP is willing to go there.RELATED:Trump's Latest Twitter Win: Carrier To Keep Nearly 1,000 Jobs At Indiana PlantAs Trumpnomics Cheers Wall Street, Economists Fret
"
349,UTX,"Donald Trump's economic policies, uncertain as they are, have sent the stock market to new highs, but are the days of slow growth really over?While economists are boosting their GDP forecasts for 2017, they are by no means expecting a boom. And some are worried that the gains from tax cuts and more infrastructure spending may be relatively short-lived.Economists are hardly of one mind, and their views should be taken with an even bigger grain of salt than usual given that Trump and Republicans in Congress have yet to show their cards. Still, investors should understand the high degree of difficulty of the maneuver the incoming administration is about to undertake.Consider that the Ronald Reagan boom fueled by tax cuts and defense spending started when interest rates and unemployment had nowhere to go but down, whereas Federal Reserve economists now think the U.S. is close to full employment and the 10-year Treasury yield sank to a historic low of 1.34% in July. In other words, rates have nowhere to go but up and the jobless rate may not be able to fall much without increasing inflation pressure.The spike in interest rates since Trump's election — the 10-year Treasury yield was at 2.33% on Monday despite pulling back from last week's 16-month high — will cut total home sales (new and existing) by 5% from October's nine-year high over the next several months, wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.That can't be good news for big homebuilders like D.R. Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN) and Pulte Group (PHM), and the sector has been a laggard during the postelection stock market rally. Still, Shepherdson says, the economic impact of slower housing market activity will be modest for three reasons. The sector makes up a much smaller share of GDP than it did before the mortgage crisis. Further, retailers of building materials and appliances , such as Lowe's (LOW) and Home Depot (HD), will only feel the effect of the housing slowdown on a lagged basis, perhaps not until the spring of 2018.But the big reason that the economy won't sweat higher rates next year is the coming fiscal boost courtesy of Trump and the GOP Congress. While Shepherdson thinks tax cuts are more likely to pass than an infrastructure spending package, he notes that the Tax Policy Center's measure of Trump's corporate and individual income-tax cuts comes to $198 billion in fiscal 2017.""Even if half of that money is saved, the boost to GDP growth would be some 0.5 percentage point, more than offsetting the housing hit,"" Shepherdson wrote.Shepherdson said he's upped his GDP growth forecast to 3.25% in 2017. Yet, the election forecast also led to his ""sharply weaker forecast for the second half of 2018,"" because he expects the fiscal boost to lead to higher inflation.IBD'S TAKE: As markets reassess prospects for faster growth, stocks like Freeport-McMoRan, Nucor and Martin Marietta are consolidating postelection gains. Read The Big Picture every day to find out whether the rally has further to run. And check out IBD Leaderboard to look for insight on stock standouts.The big uncertainty is whether the tax cuts encourage a substantial increase in labor-force participation, as Trump's advisors expect. In that case, faster growth won't fuel an overshoot in inflation that leads the Federal Reserve to step up its pace of rate hikes.""We can't know what will happen to the labor market in the face of substantial fiscal stimulus,"" Shepherdson admits, but he's worried that companies will continue to have trouble finding workers who have the skills they need.Another possibility is that the GOP could create more slack in the labor market by changing work-reducing incentives, including the ObamaCare employer mandate to offer coverage to workers clocking 30 hours per week and the Obama administration overtime rule that a federal judge just put on hold.Shepherdson is hardly alone in worrying that a GOP burst of tax-cut and spending fuel is coming at a less-than-ideal time. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen, in a Nov. 17 appearance before Congress, interpreted the bond-market reaction to Trump's election as factoring in the potential ""inflationary consequences"" from enacting a stimulus when the economy was ""relatively close to maximum employment.""Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research, figures that the Trump tax cuts and infrastructure spending worth $650 billion over two years could add up to 0.9 percentage point to annual GDP growth, though the same package could have had twice as much bang for the buck if enacted during a recession.A third big difference between the task facing Trump and the one that faced Reagan is that publicly held federal debt has more than doubled as a share of GDP. That raises the risk that Trump and the GOP Congress will fire their fiscal bullets, leading the economy to overheat, resulting in ""a deeper recession"" because there's less fiscal space to help revive growth several years down the line.It's unclear whether concerns about the budget will limit Trump's coming infrastructure spending package, which has led investors to snap up shares of copper producer Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) and steel maker Nucor (NUE).Not everyone is so concerned about the timing of the coming fiscal expansion. In fact, the 35-nation Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development on Monday urged policymakers to seize ""a unique window of opportunity to make more active use of fiscal levers to boost growth and reduce inequality without compromising debt levels.""The group sees U.S. growth picking up to 2.3% in 2017 and 3% in 2018.Beyond the issue of timing, economists have big concerns over what steps Trump will take regarding immigration and trade. Moody's Analytics figures that deportations and a less-welcoming environment for unauthorized immigrants under Trump could reduce the labor force by 2.16 million workers. Since GDP growth equals the increase in hours worked plus productivity growth, that would be a negative.Trade is an even bigger wild card. The possibilities range from Trump using his bully pulpit to get Ford (F) and United Technologies (UTX) unit Carrier to keep work in the U.S. to a growth-killing trade war.The forecast from Jefferies & Co. economists Ward McCarthy and Thomas Simons may be about as good as it gets for Republicans trying to protect or expand their majorities in the 2018 elections: GDP growth of around 3% in 2018, with a jobless rate of 4% and the personal consumption expenditures inflation at a manageable 2.5%.""Donald Trump's domestic fiscal policy proposals are pro-growth and will promote a stronger consumer sector (and) improved labor-market conditions for semiskilled and unskilled workers,"" they wrote. ""Reduced regulation will also free resources for more productive uses.""RELATED:What's Really Doable In Trump's First 100 Days?Trump Makes 'Progress' On Indiana Carrier Plant, Using Twitter Bully Pulpit

350,UTX,"Turkey will order another batch of Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35s, according to its defense minister, while China publicly unveiled its J-20 stealth fighter, which may have benefited from a Chinese hack of U.S. defense programs.Turkey will buy 24 more of the advanced F-35 stealth fighters, the country's defense chief, Fikri Isik, said in an interview with broadcaster A Haber on Tuesday. The first batch of F-35As will be delivered to Ankara in 2018, with the second order to be delivered between 2012 and 2022.While Turkey's moves to improve its relations with Russia have worried Western officials, the NATO ally has had plans order 100 F-35s and has approved funding for 30 so far. The deal also comes despite the attempted coup in Turkey earlier this year.Turkey is one of the eight international partners on the F-35, and Turkish Aerospace Industries will build some of the fuselages. United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney unit will also build some of the F-35's engines in the country.Lockheed shares dipped 0.6% to 244.98 on the stock market today. United Tech edged down 0.2% to 102.01.IBD'S TAKE: Foreign sales have become increasingly important for defense contractors to help keep production lines open, despite an improving Pentagon budget outlook. China's Chengdu J-20 stealth fighter, which analysts and U.S. officials have pointed out looks similar to Lockheed's F-22 Raptor and the F-35, made its public debut in the skies at Airshow China, in the southern city of Zhuhai.Reports say the plane likely won't be deployed until 2018, but its public unveiling comes as the U.S. Marine Corps readies the F-35 for deployment to Japan in January.In 2013, the Pentagon advisors reportedly concluded that Chinese hackers had compromised designs for top U.S. weapons programs, including the F-35, missile-defense systems, and the Navy's new littoral combat ship.RELATED: Lockheed Soars On Outlook, Payout; Next F-35 Contract Seen SplitLockheed Could Get Japan's Missile-Defense Order SoonerLockheed's F-16 Is Likely A Forerunner For India's Next Fighter Order

351,UTX,"The Defense Department has finalized a $6.1 billion contract with Lockheed Martin (LMT) for the ninth batch of F-35 stealth fighters, according to a Pentagon statement Wednesday.But Lockheed called it a ""unilateral contract action"" that wasn't mutually agreed upon, saying it was ""disappointed"" with the government's decision.The Pentagon previously had insisted the ninth and 10th batches be negotiated together under one $14 billion pact. Lockheed had already gone ahead and started producing the aircraft to stay on schedule, paying out of pocket for months while contracts were negotiated.But the Wall Street Journal reported last month that the Pentagon may award a contract for just lot 9, as talks over pricing dragged on well past expectations.The price tag for the ninth batch, which includes 57 planes, represents a 3.7% weighted average reduction from the eighth low-rate initial production contract signed in December 2014 and a 58% cut since the first such contract, DOD said Wednesday.The $6 billion doesn't include the engines. A separate contract for those was agreed upon with United Technologies (UTX) in April.The first lot 9 fighters will start delivery in Q1 of 2017. So far, 196 F-35s, including test aircraft, have been delivered.Earlier Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that the Pentagon said it will need up to $500 million more to finish the $55 billion development phase of the F-35.The program's simultaneous development and production strategy has come under heavy criticism. Michael Gilmore, the Defense Department's director of operational testing, has recommended the ""program be restructured now"" to ""deliver its long-planned and sorely needed"" full war-fighting capability, the Bloomberg report said.In August, Gilmore said in a memo that the F-35 is on ""a path toward failing to deliver"" as he said the program ""is running out of time and money.""The Air Force declared the jet was combat-ready on Aug. 2 and the Marines did the same last year. But the fighter won't have its full war-fighting complement — including the ability to fire its 25-millimeter Gatling gun — until a software upgrade next year.Lockheed shares edged up 0.1% to 245.25 in the stock market today. Shares of Northrop Grumman (NOC), a subcontractor on the plane, rose 0.1% to 228.66.IBD'S TAKE: Northrop is in buy range after the defense contractor raised its full-year earnings and sales guidance on strong third-quarter results. RELATED: Despite Closer Russia Ties, Turkey Orders More F-35s; China Debuts J-20Lockheed Soars On Outlook, Payout; Next F-35 Contract Seen Split

352,UTX,"The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing survey index out Tuesday showed a steady, slow pulse for the factory sector, ticking up to 51.9 in October from 51.5 the prior month, slightly ahead of expectations.Yet the U.S. factory sector remains stuck in first gear, and that's not likely to change as automakers tap the brakes and interest rates edge higher.Meanwhile, the construction sector has stalled outright, dragged down by weak public-sector outlays. Total construction spending in September fell 0.4% from August and 0.2% from a year ago. That's the first year-over-year decline since 2011.Private construction spending fell 0.2% from August as a 1.0% drop in nonresidential spending offset a 0.5% rise in residential spending. In the past year, nonresidential spending has led the way, rising 4.1% vs. 0.9% for residential. Still, growth in private spending has been swamped by a 7.8% drop in public construction spending from a year ago.The ISM survey showed a pickup in production to 54.6 from 52.8, but there was less visibility into future production as the new orders index slipped 3 points to 52.1 and the gauge of order backlogs fell to 45.5 from 49.5. Readings above 50 signal expansion, while those south of 50 suggest contraction.On a positive note, the employment index rose to 52.9 from 49.7.While the overall ISM was only modestly above the 50 neutral level, a sixth rise in seven months is somewhat encouraging after weak overseas growth and a retrenchment in the oil patch led to a manufacturing contraction in the second half of 2015 and early this year.Even as health care and housing costs push up services inflation, plodding growth in the industrial side of the economy gives the Federal Reserve more leeway to leave interest rates low for longer, because factory slack limits pricing power. The Federal Reserve began a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday.Ford Motor (F) said last week that it would idle some plants or run fewer shifts to avoid a backup in inventories if U.S. auto sales slow in 2017, as it expects. This week, it was cutting one of three shifts at its F-150 pickup truck plant in Kansas City, Mo.Ford said late Monday that it won't release October U.S. sales later this week due to a Monday fire, knocking out power for data systems at its Dearborn, Mich., plant. Ford is expected to report that its sales in October fell 10.9% from a year ago, according to Edmunds' auto-information service.Still, overall U.S. sales are expected to match the highest level of the year, coming in at a 17.8 million-unit annual rate, though that would be another year-over-year decline.General Motors (GM) reported sales slipped 1.7% from a year earlier, but that was much better than the 6.3% drop expected by Edmunds.IBD'S TAKE: While the Federal Reserve is virtually certain to hike interest rates in December, the strengthening dollar may lead policymakers to spring another kind of surprise to avoid a repeat of what happened after the hike in December 2015.Several industrial companies have lowered their earnings guidance in recent weeks. Steel maker Nucor (NUE) said on Oct. 20 that profitability will ""decrease notably"" in the fourth quarter, not entirely due to regular seasonality. Nucor said its end markets are a mixed bag, with automotive remaining strong, but energy, heavy equipment and agricultural markets are still weak.The ISM survey showed that 10 of 18 manufacturing industries reported growth. Among survey respondents, positive comments came from the chemical sector, computer and electronics, fabricated metals, plastics and rubber — along with food, beverage and tobacco. Negative comments came from primary metals, where it was noted that production was down 20%, and transportation equipment.General Electric (GE) said on Oct. 21 that its comparable industrial orders fell 6% during the third quarter, though its digital and software orders rose 11%.United Technologies (UTX), Caterpillar (CAT) and 3M (MMM) all offered earnings outlooks below analyst estimates when they reported last week.One positive in the third-quarter GDP report released on Friday was a 10% rise in exports, the biggest since the fourth quarter of 2013. But that trend is unlikely to continue after the surge in the dollar vs. other currencies in October.RELATED:GM, Fiat Chrysler U.S. Sales Fall Less Then Feared; Ford DelayedNucor, Steel Dynamics Profit From Fewer ImportsGM, Caterpillar Fall Below Buy Points As Industrial Giants Guide Low

353,UTX,"Boeing (BA) said Wednesday there's a ""realistic possibility"" it will launch a new midsize plane and a longer version of its 737 Max, as the aerospace giant seeks to counter gains from Airbus' (EADSY) A321neo.Management said on a conference call that a new mid-market plane could be delivered in the 2024-2025 timeframe, while a stretched 737 Max could be ready by the end of the decade.Boeing has been mulling a new midsize plane or a longer 737 to fill the gap created by 757 production stopped, but hasn't said before it would do both. The latest comments come as the company has had to lay off employees due in part to Airbus gaining market share, as the A321neo has helped airlines open up new routes.Boeing also said the production rate on the current-generation 777 likely won't go down by more than 1-2 planes a month, adding that it would take ""offsetting actions"" to limit the impact on margins of any further rate cuts.Sales of the 777 have been slowing as customers prefer to wait for the upcoming next-generation 777X, but the company is trying to maintain a certain level of current-generation 777 production to ensure a smooth transition to the 777X on its assembly lines.Boeing shares jumped 4.7% to close at 145.54 on the stock market today, clearing a 139.55 buy point from a flat base and hitting the highest level of the year. Aerospace supplier TransDigm (TDG) rose 1.1% to 271.08, topping a 269.31 entry point.
"
354,UTX,"IBD's TAKE: Foreign commercial sales are key to keeping the 777 line in production, but the aerospace giant is also chasing foreign military sales as looks to score a major fighter jet deal with India. Boeing's core Q3 EPS rose 11.5% to $2.81, excluding a 70-cent per-share tax benefit, above views for $2.60. Revenue fell 8% to $23.9 billion but topped forecasts for $23.64 billion. Revenue from its commercial airplanes division fell 4% to $16.97 billion on lower planned delivery volume. Boeing preannounced a 5.5% decline in commercial deliveries. Defense revenue fell 10% to $7.5 billion on fewer C-17 deliveries and lower F-15 volume.During the quarter, the Air Force signed two contracts with Boeing for a total value of $2.8 billion to make 19 KC-46 tankers. Boeing had taken a charge on the tanker in the last two quarters amid repeated delays and cost overruns.Boeing now plans to deliver 745 to 750 commercial airplanes this year, up from its prior outlook of 740 to 745 planes. It also raised its full-year EPS outlook to $6.80-$7 from an earlier outlook of $6.10-$6.30, but that just adds the 70-cent per-share tax benefit. Analysts see $6.34.Boeing's European rival Airbus reported a 21% drop in quarterly earnings Wednesday, falling short of analyst views due to supplier issues with its A350. Airbus's U.S.-traded shares climbed 3.4% to 15.02.But the company said problems with engines that it uses from United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney are ""largely over."" United Tech shares dipped 0.4% to 101.01.""For the remaining months of the year we remain totally focused on deliveries to achieve our earnings and cash guidance,"" CEO Tom Enders said in a release.Airbus said it would deliver over 208 planes by the end of the year, and deliveries of the A350 will nearly double.At its helicopter unit, Airbus saw a slowdown in commercial sales.In a positive day for defense contractors, Northrop Grumman (NOC) broke out of a flat base, gapping above the 224.22 buy point. The company raised its full-year earnings and sales guidance Wednesday after reporting third-quarter results above analyst expectations.Other big gainers in the group included Flir Systems (FLIR), which shot up 10%, and TransDigm Group (TDG), which broke out past the 269.41 buy point of a flat base. Earnings reports were the catalysts for Boeing and Flir Systems. Weapons electronics company L3 Communications (LLL) rose only 0.5% but volume was heavy.RELATED: Lockheed Martin Soars On Outlook; Next F-35 Contract Seen SplitBoeing To 'Wait And See' If Qatar Order Can Prevent 777 Output CutBoeing's Cash Flow Called Strong, But A320 Line Seen As Major Threat 
"
355,UTX,"Boeing's (BA) Q3 earnings are seen rising, but the aerospace giant could take a hit from slumping 777 sales and problems with its military tanker.Analysts expect earnings to rise 3.2% to $2.60 per share but revenue is seen falling 8.6% to $23.64 billion.Boeing preannounced a 5.5% decline in commercial deliveries as deliveries of its 737 fell to 120 from 126, 787 deliveries fell to 36 from 37 a year ago, and 777 deliveries were flat at 22. But defense deliveries rose 4.2% during the quarter.Analysts will be looking to see if Boeing cuts production of its current-generation 777 line. The company has already announced that it is cutting production of the widebody jet to 7 per month in 2017, down from 8.3 per month currently. But that pace is threatened by slowing sales as carriers instead look to the next-generation 777X model.Earlier this month, Qatar Airways ordered 10 777s as part of a larger deal that could total 100 airplanes, mostly 737s and 787s. But executives said it's still too early to tell if the  777s that the Mideast carrier ordered will be enough to keep production levels for the widebody jet steady.Jefferies analyst Howard Rubel said in an note dated Oct. 6 that Boeing could get 777 orders from carriers like Swiss Air, Saudi Arabia's Saudia and Chinese airlines.Boeing might also provide an update on the sale of commercial jets to Iran. Last month, Boeing received a license from the Treasury Department to sell planes to the Islamic republic for the first time since its 1979 revolution. In June, Boeing and Iran reached a tentative deal for more than 100 commercial planes.Despite new orders, Boeing has cut nearly 4,000 jobs in its commercial division so far this year as it loses market share to European rival Airbus (EADSY). More cuts could be on the table as Boeing gave 180 employees advanced layoff notice last week.To counter Airbus' dominance with its A321neo in the space, Boeing is considering lengthening its current 737 Max 9, the largest plane in the 737 family with 180 seats, or redesigning it with larger engines, according to reports last month.IBD'S TAKE: Foreign commercial sales are key to keeping the 777 line in production, but the aerospace giant is also chasing foreign military sales as looks to score a major fighter jet deal with India. On the defense side, Boeing could address its KC-46 Air Force tanker program, which has been beset with delays and extra costs. The company took a $393 million after-tax charge on the plane in Q2, due to higher costs to work on technical issues that put the plane behind schedule.Boeing also reported a charge on the tanker in Q1 and has racked up $1.5 billion in cost overruns on additional engineering and development work. Still, the tanker cleared a key milestone in August, allowing low-rate initial production to begin.Last month, the White House approved sales of up to 72 Boeing F-15s for Qatar, 32 Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets for Kuwait, and 19 Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-16s to Bahrain after a massive aid package for Israel was approved.Airbus is slated to report quarterly results Wednesday. Engine maker Pratt & Whitney's parent company, United Technologies (UTX), will report results Tuesday as will defense giant Lockheed.Boeing shares rose 1.3% to close at 137.45 on the stock market today. Airbus climbed 0.9% to 14.85. And United Technologies advanced 0.9% as well, finishing at 99.52.RELATED: Rockwell Collins Will Buy B/E Aerospace As Boeing, Airbus Squeeze Suppliers

360,UTX,"It was a huge week for earnings. Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) were A-list headliners, but a slew of industrials, medicals, restaurants and more also reported. Tesla Motors (TSLA) reported a surprise profit, while Qualcomm (QCOM) will buy NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).The Nasdaq fell 1.3% for the week, with Amazon's miss and Apple's modest beat failing to impress. The tech-heavy index dropped below its 50-day line after retaking that level last week. The S&P 500 sank 0.7%, while the Dow rose 0.1%.

Amazon shares fell 5.2% Friday, closing below its 50-day line for the first time in months.Q3 earnings per share minus items rose 23% to $9.06 while total revenue climbed 20% to $22.45 billion vs. consensus estimates of $8.60 and $22.05 billion. Google-parent Alphabet signaled higher investments in its  cloud computing business and higher Q4 marketing costs tied to the September launch of Pixel-branded smartphones and a smart home speaker that competes with Amazon's Echo. Google's Q3 net revenue — despite higher traffic acquisition costs (TAC) costs of $4.18 billion — was $18.27 billion, topping views.Alphabet shares nearly hit a record high Friday morning, but closed the day fractionally higher and the week fractionally lower, but still in buy range.Tesla Motors earned 71 cents a share excluding items, soundly beating the consensus estimate of a 54-cent loss. Revenue climbed 45% to $2.3 billion, up 45% and topping estimates of $1.977 billion. Elon Musk had pushed Tesla to boost deliveries and turn a profit in Q3, but some analysts are skeptical that the effort is sustainable. Tesla maintained its guidance of 50,000 vehicle deliveries for the second half of 2016, with a Q4 plan of just over 25,000.Tesla and SolarCity (SCTY) late Friday were expected to unveil an integrated product offering of solar panels, battery storage and charger.

Santa Clara, Calif.-based Gigamon said Q3 EPS minus items rose 64% to 36 cents, while revenue jumped 47% to $83.5 million. Analysts had projected 31 cents and $79.6 million. In the current quarter, Gigamon forecast EPS of 37 cents and revenue of $92 million at its midpoint of guidance vs. consensus estimates of 33 cent profit and 29% revenue growth to $86 million. Analysts say AT&T (T) may be a new customer, joining T-Mobile US (TMUS).Gigamon shot up 16.1% Friday, hitting a record high intraday. Shares had fallen 5.2% Thursday to below its 50-day line.Lumentum (LITE) said Q1 EPS rose 69% to 44 cents and revenue climbed 19% to $252.3 million, topping expectations but current quarter revenue guidance was light amid a telecom component shortage from an unnamed supplier. EPS guidance of 51 cents at the midpoint was above consensus estimates of 49 cents. Lumentum fell 3.7% after its late Thursday report, but that followed a 4.3% fall Thursday as Acacia Communications (ACIA) crashed 16% that day and for the week. Chinese telecom gear giant ZTE, a key Acacia customer, reported weak revenue.Qualcomm announced a deal to buy NXP Semiconductors for $39 billion, creating the No. 2 chipmaker by revenue after Intel (INTC). Including debt, the deal is worth $47 billion.

Shares, which had been near an 18-month high, fell nearly 13% on Wednesday, tumbling below its 50-day line.Biogen (BIIB) posted $2.96 billion in sales and $5.19 EPS ex items, topping views and prodding shares up nearly 4%. Thursday, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) rose 5%, Celgene (CELG) 7% and Alexion (ALXN) 9% after beating on earnings. Amgen (AMGN) late Thursday beat, but shares tumbled nearly 10% Friday amid concerns about key drug Enbrel going forward.

361,UTX,"Lockheed Martin's (LMT) third-quarter results topped Wall Street views and the company raised its full-year outlook, while the next two production batches of the F-35 could be split into separate contracts.Estimates: Q3 EPS up 3.6% to $2.87; revenue virtually flat at $11.45 billion.Results: Adjusted EPS of $3.61 on revenue of $11.55 billion. Revenue at the aeronautics unit climbed 6.8% to $4.19 billion on higher F-35 sales, and mission systems revenue jumped 55% on the $9 billion acquisition of Sikorsky from United Technologies (UTX) last year.Outlook: Full-year sales of $46.5 billion, vs. consensus for $46.36 billion, up from its July outlook of $45 billion-$46.2 billion and sees full year EPS of $12.10, above consensus of $11.77, up from its prior outlook of $11.15-$11.45. Lockheed sees 2017 sales up 7% vs. 2016, better than consensus of 2.8%.F-35: Lockheed's upbeat outlook rests on getting contracts for the next two batches of F-35 production, known as lots 9 and 10, and has been paying out of pocket for months while contracts are negotiated with the Pentagon to keep up the production schedule.To help cut costs, the Pentagon has been adamant that lots 9 and 10 should be negotiated together under one $14 billion contract that includes 140 jets.

"
363,UTX,"Manufacturer Dover (DOV) on Monday cut its full-year sales and profit forecasts, due in part to weakness in some oil and gas markets, and a global economy that it expects to remain sluggish, adding to similar warnings from industrials like Honeywell (HON) and PPG Industries (PPG).Dover — which makes equipment that helps oil and gas producers, as well as refrigeration equipment — slashed its full-year earnings per share forecast to $3.00-$3.05 from an earlier outlook for $3.35-$3.45. Dover also now sees full-year revenue down 4% to 5%, compared to earlier guidance for a 3%-5% decline.Analysts see EPS of $3.34 on a 1.3% revenue decline.""The primary factors driving this revision are generally weaker capital spending across several industrial end-markets, continued weakness in longer cycle oil & gas exposed markets, and continued headwinds in our retail refrigeration business related to production inefficiencies,"" the company said in a statement.Shares sank 7.7% to close at 66.69 in the stock market today, breaching support at their 50-day line and nearly blowing through the bottom of a cup base after climbing closer to a breakout last week. Among other diversified manufacturers, General Electric (GE) fell 0.8% and United Technologies (UTX) lost 0.6%.Dover also said it would complete its acquisition of Wayne Fueling Systems in the first quarter of 2017, later than initially expected, due to U.K. regulators' concerns over competition. In June, the company said that acquisition would likely close in the back half of 2016.Dover's downbeat forecast comes after Honeywell late Thursday trimmed its own full-year guidance, saying a weaker oil industry, along with struggles in emerging markets, have hurt aircraft demand.IBD'S TAKE: Even as energy markets remain a concern, IBD's Oil & Gas U.S. Exploration and Production group has surged to the second best among 197 groups tracked.

368,UTX,"Airbus's (EADSY) August deliveries helped push the European aerospace giant toward its lofty target for the year.Airbus said it delivered 61 planes last month, for a total of 400 planes so far this year. The company had set a target of delivering 650 aircraft this year but supply delays have been weighing on deliveries and it now is on track to deliver 645 this year.Delivers of the upgraded A320neo have been delayed due to issues with engines from United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney division. Airbus said it delivered 16 A320neo jets so far this year with three jets using alternative engines from CFM, a General Electric (GE) and Safran joint venture.In June, Qatar Airways canceled its first delivery of Airbus A320neo jets due to delays and looked at Boeing (BA) narrow-body planes as a replacement.Last month was the best August for the plane maker, whose previous August delivery record was 47 planes in 2013.Airbus' U.S. listed shares jumped 2.7% to 15.265 on the stock market today, moving back toward the 200-day line.GE shares fell 1.3% to 30.89, hitting a 2-month low, as General Electric agreed to buy two 3-D printer makers for $1.4 billion.

Both Boeing and Airbus are expected to record a drop in orders year-over-year after a lackluster Farnborough Airshow in July, as weak economic factors and massive backlogs drag down aircraft orders.Airbus also announced orders worth up to $6.5 billion in list prices from three Vietnamese airlines on Tuesday.Vietnam Airlines will buy 10 more A350s, Jetstar Pacific will buy 10 A320s and Vietjet signed a firm order for 20 A321s. In May Boeing signed an order for 100 737 Max planes with VietJet, the largest order ever for the Vietnamese budget airline.IBD'S TAKE: While commercial sales overall are lagging this year, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon could get more defense orders from Vietnam as the U.S. fully lifts its arms embargo against the country 41 years after the close of the Vietnam War. Related: Airbus' A380 Demand Wanes As Qantas Doesn't Want Rest Of Order
"
369,UTX,"Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 wowed crowds at the Farnborough Airshow in the U.K. last month, streaking across the sky, hovering in midair and even flying backward. Weeks later, the Air Force declared its version of the F-35 combat ready. Despite ongoing concerns about its development, the stealth fighter continues to reach key milestones, and production will hit full speed in a few years.Meanwhile, Northrop Grumman (NOC), which is a major subcontractor on the F-35, has locked down the other key piece of the Pentagon's combat aircraft upgrade cycle, winning the B-21 contract last year to build replacements for Cold War-era Boeing (BA) B-52s.With the $400 billion F-35 and $80 billion B-21 contracts in hand, Lockheed and Northrop would appear to have established air superiority. But there are hundreds of billions of Pentagon aerospace dollars still up for grabs, and demand overseas for high-tech missiles is on the rise, meaning Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon (RTN) and Boeing can make more money and boost their shares as the new weapons stay in service for decades.""The general view at the moment is that investors prefer the longer horizon of a defense portfolio,"" said Howard Rubel, Jefferies managing director in equity research. ""If you look at the viability of Northrop or Raytheon today, there is enough turmoil that defense will continue to grow at a faster rate than the overall economy.""And Lockheed's expected organic growth of 4% through 2018 tops the 2.8% pace for the overall defense sector, Goldman Sachs said Wednesday, citing the F-35 program's size. Growth at Northrop, Raytheon and Flir Systems (FLIR), however, could outpace Lockheed's, Goldman added.Lockheed shares fell 1.65% Friday and are up 12.6% so far this year. Northrop dipped 0.7% but has seen a 12% climb in 2016. Raytheon has run 13% higher, while Boeing has lost 8.5%.IBD'S TAKE: Lockheed shares have eased below buy range, Northrop is 5.5% below an entry point, while Raytheon is above buying territory. While Boeing has been a drag on the Aerospace/Defense group, the pure-play defense stocks have helped lift the industry group to No. 66 out of the 197 IBD tracks, and they also have been boosting their dividends.Boeing, however, is entering a transition period in its defense unit, which lost the B-21 bid with partner Lockheed. As production of its F-15 Eagle and F/A-18 Super Hornet eventually winds down, Boeing -- whose 100-year history includes icons like the B-17 Flying Fortress and the P-51 Mustang -- faces the prospect of no longer making fighters or bombers.In July, Boeing's top defense executive said that the aerospace giant would shift its focus from new fighter jets to maintenance services on existing aircraft, new helicopters, satellites, space programs, and selling more military versions of its passenger jets. But Boeing said that decision wasn't based on one contract loss.""No one competition is going to drive that. It's a matter of managing the investment portfolio that we have with the opportunity and campaigns that we want to go after and win,"" Steve Nordlund, Boeing's vice president for strategy for defense, space and security, said in an interview.Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon and other defense contractors are turning their sights to U.S. nuclear missile contracts that could be worth more than $90 billion.Late last month, the Air Force released requests for proposals for a Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) intercontinental ballistic missile to replace Boeing's aging Minuteman system, and a Long-Range Standoff (LRSO) nuclear cruise missile to replace Boeing AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles.The GBSD's estimated cost is $62 billion over 30 years (though an independent Pentagon cost assessment found that estimate is too low). The LRSO's cost has been estimated at $20 billion-$30 billion. Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop and Lockheed are expected to bid on the two contracts, and initial contracts are expected to be awarded next year.Boeing officials were bullish in a recent interview with IBD that they would win the award for the GBSD, based on past work in the field.""We are confident the Air Force can rely on us, given our proven commitment,"" said Rich Choppa, director of global sales and marketing at Boeing's defense unit. ""We are just as committed to developing a new system as we were back in 1958 when we developed the Minuteman system that stood the test of time.""Other potential prime contractors for the Minuteman upgrade include Lockheed and Northrop. Some 37 other contractors are bidding on subcontractor work.The issue of ""helicopter money"" isn't limited to central banks. But unlike the European Central Bank or the Bank of Japan, the Pentagon isn't contemplating a massive dump of cash from hovering helicopters. Instead, the Pentagon is preparing a massive dump of cash onto makers of helicopters.While less sexy than fighter jets and supersonic missiles, the U.S. military's fleet of helicopters is also due for an upgrade. The Army is looking to replace its Black Hawk helicopters as heavy use in Afghanistan and Iraq have worn them out faster than expected. Textron's (TXT) Bell division is competing against a Boeing-Sikorsky team.The Army is also looking at replacements for its Boeing AH-64 Apache and CH-47 Chinook as well as its Bell OH-58 Kiowa. Providing helicopters to take the places of all four aircraft will be worth an estimated $100 billion. The Pentagon is expected to seek official proposals in 2019, followed by a contract award in 2020.""We feel very strong about our military helicopter position in the market place and the capabilities we would provide customers,"" Boeing's Nordlund said.Lockheed has spent heavily in helicopters, acquiring Sikorsky from United Technologies (UTX) last year for $9 billion and is looking to recoup its investment.Lockheed, Boeing, Raytheon and Northrop are all competing for another major Pentagon contract: the Air Force's $8 billion-$10 billion T-X trainer jet, which will be used to train F-22 and F-35 pilots and has potential for massive overseas sales to international customers like the U.K., Italy and others who are buying the F-35.Raytheon is on an industry team that includes Finmeccanica and CAE. Lockheed has partnered with Korea Aerospace Industries. Boeing and Saab are bidding together, and Northrop is leading a coalition that includes BAE Systems and L-3 Communications (LLL). The competition is expected to be fierce, and a contract award is expected late next year.On Lockheed's Q2 conference call, CEO Marillyn Hewson called its upgraded T-50A, which completed its first test flight in South Korea in June, ""a very good offering. It's an excellent solution. It's low risk.""Boeing has kept its design under wraps, only releasing concept art of the nose of a jet, though more details are expected next month. Pictures of a Northrop prototype in Mojave, Calif., leaked out earlier this week and appeared to share some similarities with the Air Force's current trainer jet, the T-38, which is also made by Northrop.Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop and privately held General Atomics are the likely bidders for the Navy's aerial-refueling drone, the MQ-25A Stingray.The program has been scaled back from its original inception, which envisioned a drone that would perform strike and surveillance missions.The Navy is still working on the requirements for the tanker drone, but stealth won't be on that list, Vice Adm. Mike Shoemaker told reporters earlier this month. The service plans to issue a formal request for proposals in the second half of next year and award a contract in 2018.Derrick Maple, unmanned systems analyst at IHS Markit, estimates that development, production and support costs could reach $6 billion.As missiles become more advanced, foreign governments are increasingly looking to them to boost defenses amid deepening global tensions.Last year, Raytheon booked a $2 billion order from Saudi Arabia for its Patriot missile and air defense system. South Korea and Japan are also paying Raytheon to upgrade their Patriot systems as the missile threat from North Korea looms. And by year's end, the Polish government is expected to finalize a Patriot deal that is estimated at $5.5 billion amid rising friction with Russia.Raytheon is also working with Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems on revamping the Iron Dome defense system for its bid for the U.S. Army's Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 as protection against missiles and drones, among other threats.Raytheon isn't alone in the missile-defense market. Lockheed's THAAD system will be stationed in South Korea by late 2017. Lockheed and partner MBDA, a European defense giant, are bidding on a $4.5 billion German missile-defense deal that could be wrapped up later this year.And while U.S. involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan has greatly diminished over the last decade, the war against ISIS is boosting demand for munitions. Berenberg analysts said earlier this year that they expect sales of Lockheed's Hellfire missiles and the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles to climb 7%-8% this year on ""restocking activities in the U.S. and export demand.""Geopolitical strains should continue spurring more spending. In addition to the Islamic State in the Middle East, Beijing's territorial claims in the South China Sea, and Russia flexing its muscles in Eastern Europe, disputes with China in the East China Sea are leading Japan to develop a land-to-sea missile system of its own. Top U.S. defense contractors may get involved.""The thing with these top-tier contractors, they have a lot of capabilities they can apply to various product areas that they want to invest in,"" Jefferies analyst Rubel said.RELATED:Lockheed F-35 'On A Path Toward Failing To Deliver' Full CapabilityNavy To Modernize Boeing Super Hornets To Fly With Lockheed F-35Boeing May Extend F/A-18 Work On Kuwait, Navy OrdersAir Force Touts Combat-Ready F-35 As 'Deterrent To Adversaries' 
"
370,UTX,"WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35A is now ready to deploy to Syria or any other global hot spot, and the Air Force sees the stealth fighter as a symbol of U.S. strength.
"
371,UTX,"On Tuesday, the Air Force approved its version of the fighter for combat, after the first 12 F-35As met mission requirements, such as combat air support, suppression of enemy air defenses, and other operations in a contested environment. The Air Force eventually plans to procure 1,763 F-35As.
"
372,UTX,"For now, the service's F-35A squadron will fly out of Hill Air Force Base in Utah. But if commanders in the field request it, the F-35A will deploy overseas, Gen. Hawk Carlisle, commander of Air Combat Command, told reporters at the Pentagon. He added that the F-35 will likely see action sooner than the F-22 did. Lockheed's F-22 was declared ready for combat in 2005 but didn't engage in combat until 2014 when it struck ISIS targets in Syria. Earlier opportunities to deploy the F-22 were seen as too provocative, but Carlisle said sending the F-35 to the Middle East or Europe today would ""reassure friends and is a deterrent to adversaries.""Lockheed shares closed up 0.85% on the stock market today. Northrop Grumman (NOC), a major subcontractor on the F-35 program, gained 0.9%. United Technologies (UTX), which makes the engines for the fighter, dipped 0.6%.IBD'S TAKE: Several defense firms are in buy range after strong earnings results. See how Lockheed's shares stack up against others in the group on Stock Checkup.  In July 2015, the F-35B variant was declared combat-ready by the Marines and is set for deployment to Japan in 2017. The Navy's version, the F-35C, is expected to be combat-ready between 2018 and 2019.Although the F-35A has now reached initial operational capability (IOC), it must wait until next year to have full war-fighting capabilities as part of its 3F software upgrade, which will enable the F-35 to fire its 25 mm Gatling gun, among other things.And the fighter won't reach full operational capability until the 2021-2022 time frame, when two fighter wings of about 72 aircraft each will be ready for deployment with the latest software and updates to the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS), considered the ""brains"" of the aircraft.Meanwhile, its close-air-support features are still only at a basic level, and pilots who weigh less than 136 pounds are still restricted from flying the F-35 due to issues with the ejection seat that could snap a lightweight pilot's neck. The Pentagon has said it is working with Lockheed to get a fix and lift the restriction.Despite the work that still needs to be done, the plane is ready enough. Last week, Air Force officials said that the 34th Fighter Squadron, stationed at Hill Air Force Base, had reached all the milestones required for the F-35A's IOC. The fighters tested missiles in air-to-air configurations and one even hit a drone.The Air Force's IOC declaration marks another milestone for the behind-schedule and over-budget program, which has come under intense criticism in recent years.In addition to its $400 billion procurement and $1 trillion operating and maintenance price tags, doubts how the fighter matches up against other planes have come up.For example, the military blog War Is Boring reported last year that an older F-16 outmaneuvered the F-35 in an air-combat test, setting off a firestorm of criticism.But the Pentagon has since said the F-35 wasn't equipped with its full array of avionics, helmet mounted display, or compete stealth coatings. It also tried to downplay dogfighting, saying that's not the F-35's main mission.Another fifth-generation stealth fighter, the F-22, was designated primarily as an air superiority fighter. But it was canceled less than halfway into its production run as costs soared, leaving the Air Force with only 187 operational planes.On Tuesday, Carlisle alluded to those differences in the two fighter jets.""The F-35 is the best air-to air-airplane in the world except for the F-22, and the F-22 is the best air-to-ground airplane in the world except for the F-35,"" he said. ""When you look at the primary mission of the F-35, its ability to do the air-to-ground role across missions is the best capability airplane out there today. But it's not the F-22 in respect to maneuverability.""Related:What It's Really Like To Fly The F-35: A Marine Pilot Speaks

373,UTX,"This earnings season, companies like Starbucks (SBUX) and McDonald's (MCD) have been more candid about mounting global dread, going beyond euphemisms like ""challenging environment,"" as other giants like Apple (AAPL) and General Electric (GE) grapple with China's slowing economy and the Brexit vote.The remarks offer brief insights into management's thinking about an array of issues that have cropped up in earnings conference calls more recently, including the U.S. presidential election, the failed coup in Turkey and its fallout, mass shootings at home, and ISIS-inspired attacks worldwide.The CEOs of McDonald's and Starbucks -- whose sales depend on people going to their restaurants without worrying about their paychecks or safety -- both weighed in on the unease, according to Seeking Alpha transcripts.""I think we have a situation where you have a very uncertain election,"" Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said. ""You have domestic civil unrest with regard to race. And I think the issues around terror have created a level of anxiety. And so, we're no longer looking at just an economic downturn.""Schultz said conditions were ""quite unusual."" But he also said that the needs which the ubiquitous coffee chain appeals to -- ""the sense of community, the longing for human connection, a safe place, an affordable luxury"" -- would benefit the company overall.While cheaper grocery prices may encourage more people to eat at home, McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook said, ""there's just a broader level of uncertainty in consumers' minds at the moment, both trying to gauge their financial security going forward, you know, whether through elections or through global events, people are slightly mindful of an unsettled world.""The company benefits from ""people moving around, going to the malls, driving around, going on vacations,"" he continued. ""And if people are reining in their (spending) across broader categories, that will have a little bit of a flow-through to us as well.""That sentiment also lines up with a recent note from KeyBanc Capital Markets, which upgraded Papa John's (PZZA), saying that civil unrest and a heated political environment may keep people at home -- and keep them ordering pizza -- instead of going out.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Papa John's and rival Domino's Pizza cleared buy points recently despite the overall restaurant sector facing a slowdown amid wage pressure and tougher price competition.The Brexit vote also has come up a lot during earnings calls, but its impact is not yet clear, while other global events and the outcome of the U.S. presidential vote are adding another layer of complexity, according to comments gleaned from Seeking Alpha transcripts.Michael DeWalt, a vice president at Caterpillar (CAT), said the U.K. vote to leave the European Union, the upheaval in Turkey and ""all the negative rhetoric around the U.S. elections"" added to the risks the construction firm was facing.Big banks generally turned out solid second-quarter results, but Goldman Sachs (GS) and Citigroup (C) commented on the ""unique"" course of the U.S. campaigns, which have turned banks into the favorite punching bags of both Democrats and Republicans.Goldman CFO Harvey Schwartz said he felt ""this cycle will have unique aspects to it vs. other presidential cycles,"" but that he didn't foresee any short-term damage.But Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat said world tensions could further stall any Federal Reserve interest rate increases. ""While the U.K. has a new leader,"" he said, ""the U.S. is still in the midst of a unique presidential campaign, and such geopolitical and economic uncertainty doesn't create a clear picture for potential interest rate increases.""McDonald's said Brexit had not significantly affected U.K. demand and that the vote was unlikely to harm commodity prices there in the near term. But the company shaved a few cents off its profit-per-share forecast in part because the vote caused the pound to plummet. Starbucks said Brexit had piled on to already existing worries in Europe.And General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt said, ""Brexit is just another point of volatility. It wasn't the outcome we hoped for, but we were plenty ready for that as just another point of volatility.""It's difficult to gauge the state of China's economy through executives' commentary, which came in mixed.Apple CEO Tim Cook remained optimistic. Apple's fiscal Q3 results topped expectations, and iPhone sales were better than expected amid concerns the market was saturated.But while he said that ""switchers and first-time smartphone buyers"" made up most of the company's quarterly iPhone sales in Greater China, he conceded that the region's economy has cooled.""This is reflected in consumer confidence and retail spending, and the Chinese yuan has depreciated by 7% relative to the U.S. dollar since August of last year,"" he said. ""Hong Kong's tourism and retail businesses also continue to be significantly impacted by the stronger Hong Kong dollar relative to other Asian currencies.""United Technologies (UTX), a conglomerate that owns the elevator and escalator-maker Otis, offered a glimpse into China's real estate market. Transactions, management said, had picked up some steam, but the gains hadn't translated into more money from elevator sales.""In China, while the number of property transactions and home prices -- particularly in the tier 1 cities -- show growth year-to-date, the elevator new equipment market is down, and price pressure has increased,"" CFO Akhil Johri said on the company's earnings call.Meanwhile, GE said China was ""getting better."" Starbucks touted its own performance in the region, while McDonald's said comps in China rose.Those gains, McDonald's said, came ""despite a challenging environment.""

374,UTX,"Results were mixed for four big-cap Dow stocks reporting early Tuesday: United Technologies (UTX), 3M (MMM), Caterpillar (CAT) and DuPont (DD). The slump in commodity prices, especially oil and gas, dragged on results.But shares of United Tech and Caterpillar ended the day in buy territory. The diversified maker of aircraft engines under its Pratt & Whitney business, Otis brand elevators, heating and security systems and other products reported 5.2% higher adjusted second-quarter earnings at $1.82 a share, crushing views for $1.68. Revenue fell 8.9% to $14.9 billion, topping estimates of $14.7 billion.United Technologies said it's on track to meet its growth goals out to 2020 and raised its third-quarter earnings outlook to $6.45-$6.60 a share, up from $6.30-$6.60. The midpoint is still a few cents below analyst consensus of $6.55.Shares rallied 3.1% to close at 107.89, above a 107.17 buy point in a flat base, in the stock market today.The nation's largest mining and equipment maker's second-quarter earnings fell 14% to $1.09 a share and revenue slid 16% to $10.34 billion as the company deals with slack orders amid sluggishness in the mining sector after a downturn last year. Wall Street expected 96 cents earnings and $10.12 billion revenue.Caterpillar Chief Executive Doug Olberman said in a written statement that, ""we're having success managing through the downturn in industries like mining and oil and gas, and in sluggish economic conditions in much of the developing world."" Caterpillar plans more job cuts and lowered its 2016 earnings forecast to $3.55 from $3.70 a share earlier, and its sales outlook to $40 billion-$40.5 billion, down from $40 billion-$42 billion previously.Shares jumped 5.2% to 82.75, topping an 80.99 buy point.The maker of tapes, adhesives, medical supplies and other products reported a 3% rise in earnings to $2.08 a share on a fractional decline in revenue to $7.662 billion. Analysts expected $2.07 earnings a share and $7.707 billion revenue. Sales at its health care division rose 4.9%, while consumer goods were up 2.7% and its safety and graphics products climbed 2.3%. Those were offset by a 1.4% drop in industrial output and a 9.1% plunge in its electronics and energy units.It was the sixth straight quarter of lower revenue for 3M and its full-year sales forecast of 0%-1% growth is below consensus. However, its stock has risen about 35% from a 2016 low of 134.65 on Jan. 20 on prospects of renewed growth.Shares of 3M slipped 1.1% to 177.66.IBD'S TAKE: DuPont formed a more than five month long cup-with-handle base and broke out early Tuesday, climbing above a 69.50 buy point. For other, higher rated diversified manufacturers, go to DuPont's IBD Stock Checkup here.The maker of products for the agricultural, food, building, communications and other industries is in the midst of merging with Dow Chemical (DOW), a pairing that would create a diversified manufacturer with roughly $73 billion annual sales. DuPont Chief Executive Ed Breen said in the earnings report that ""We are preparing to hit the ground running,"" if the merger receives regulatory approval, which could happen by the end of the year, he said.DuPont's second-quarter earnings climbed 5% to $1.24 a share, easily topping forecasts for $1.10. Revenue fell 18% to $7.061 billion, topping projections of $7.008 billion.DuPont stock rose 0.4% to 69.16, just under a 69.50 buy point of a long cup-with-handle base, often a prelude to a breakout. Dow Chemical edged up 0.5% to 53.54.
"
375,UTX,"Stocks erased early gains to turn lower Tuesday morning as Dow component McDonald's (MCD) reported weak domestic sales, with investors looking ahead to Apple (AAPL) earnings due out after the close.The Nasdaq fell 0.2%, the S&P 500 0.3% and the Dow 0.5%. Volume was tracking higher than at the same time Monday on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq exchanges in the stock market today.Crude oil prices fell about 1% to $42.73 a barrel, continuing a recent slide. Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) were testing support at their 50-day moving averages.McDonald's reported U.S. same-store growth below forecasts. The stock gapped down and was trading down 4.5% to 121.68. McDonald's had recently cleared a 124.18 buy point in a double-bottom base, but is now back below that entry area. The stock is also below its 50-day line.Fellow Dow stock Apple fell 0.5% to 96.88 intraday, back below its 50-day moving average. Apple has been a laggard. EPS is expected to fall 25% when it reports after the close today.IBD'S TAKE: Apple was once a dynamic market leader. Now, it underperforms. See the tale of the tape at IBD's Stock Checkup.Among six Dow components that reported early Tuesday, Caterpillar (CAT) rose nearly 2% after posting earnings of $1.09 a share compared to $1.27 a year earlier, but better than the consensus estimate of 96 cents.3M (MMM) beat and raised guidance and was down nearly 2%. United Technologies (UTX) rose 2% after reporting its results. DuPont (DD) gained less than 1% after its report as it broke out of a cup-with-handle base. And Verizon (VZ) fell nearly 2% on its own report.
"
376,UTX,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) raised its full-year outlook after reporting second-quarter results above analyst estimates, but management warned it can't sustain its current level of spending on the F-35 unless the company gets another production contract from the Pentagon soon.The defense contractor has been in talks with the Defense Department for another two batches of stealth fighters. But it already started producing some of the F-35s covered in the pending contract with its own cash flow and $625 million from the Pentagon meant to offset some costs until the final contract was approved.""If we don't get funding … we won't be able to continue that level of cash outflow,"" CFO Bruce Tanner said during the company's Q2 conference call. ""The Pentagon clearly knows that situation and I'm optimistic we are going to get cash soon.""Lockheed shares ended 1% higher on the stock market today, after rising as much as 2.8% earlier to hit a fresh record high, then reversing lower.IBD'S TAKE: Lockheed shares finished just above buy range, after breaking out late last month. For more tips on buying and selling stocks, click here.While funding remains an issue at home, the attempted coup in Turkey isn't expected to weigh on F-35 sales or production.""We have a long, long history with Turkey,"" Tanner said. ""We've worked with them since early days of the F-16s and built some F-16s there. We are also doing parts of the F-35 in Turkey.""Turkey is expected to buy 100 F-35s.Lockheed's Q2 earnings, excluding an income tax benefit, jumped nearly 10% to $3.28 per share, beating views by 35 cents. Sales climbed 10.8% to $12.91 billion, above views for $12.55 billion.Looking ahead, Lockheed raised its 2016 EPS outlook for the second time this year to $12.15-$12.45, up from an earlier forecast of $11.50-$11.80. It now sees sales of $50 billion-$51.5 billion, up from $49.6 billion-$51.1 billion. Analysts project EPS of $11.84 and revenue of $50.46 billion.Sales at Lockheed's aeronautics unit rose 6% to $4.36 billion on increased volume on aircraft production and sustainment activities for the F-35 program. Lockheed delivered 14 F-35s in Q2 vs. 11 a year ago.The company plans to deliver 43 F-35s this year and is expanding operations at its Fort Worth, Texas, plant so it can produce 200 jets per year by the end of 2019.Lockheed's missiles and fire control segment sales rose 2% to $1.68 billion. Sales at the space systems unit fell 3% to $2.22 billion on lower volumes of government satellite programs.The ramp-up in F-35 production is good news for other defense contractors. United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney division builds the engines, and Northrop Grumman (NOC) is a major subcontractor.United Technologies reports earnings July 26, and Northrop's are due on July 27.United Technologies shares edged up 0.1%, and Northrop added 0.3%Tuesday.
"
377,UTX,"Lockheed Martin's (LMT) second-quarter revenue is seen rising as F-35 production ramps up, while prospects for foreign sales may get a boost from the stealth fighter's successful demonstration at the Farnborough Airshow.Analysts expect the defense giant's EPS to dip 0.3% to $2.93, but see revenue climbing 8% to $12.56 billion, when it announces Q2 results Tuesday.Lockheed plans to deliver 43 F-35s this year but is expanding operations at its Fort Worth, Texas, plant so it can produce 200 jets per year by the end of 2019. The F-35 and other planes are vital to Lockheed as its aeronautics division, the largest single unit, accounts for roughly 34% of the company's total sales.Earlier this month, Lockheed said it was near an agreement with the Pentagon on a contract covering additional production batches for 160 more F-35s.IBD'S TAKE: Defense stocks have been in buy range recently and showing strength amid recent market volatility.The F-35's fortunes will also factor into other defense contractors' results. United Technologies (UTX) whose Pratt & Whitney division got a $1.5 billion contract in April for 99 more F-35 engines, reports July 26. Northrop Grumman (NOC), another major subcontractor on the F-35, reports July 27.Meanwhile, the F-35's cost is also coming down. Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson told CNBC last week that the price is now 57% lower vs. the first aircraft delivered to the Air Force in 2011 and will be fall to $85 million per plane in 2019 from $100 million now. The Pentagon has also said it will extend by two years an F-35 cost-cutting program that so far has trimmed the price tag by $1 million per plane.Reducing the cost could help ease sticker shock on Capitol Hill and increase its appeal overseas. The F-35 finally made its major international debut flying at Farnborough last week, with impressive displays of its short-takeoff, vertical-landing and hovering capabilities seen providing political cover to governments that want to buy the over-budget and behind-schedule fighter.Lockheed has been pushing to expand its foreign sales to account for 25%-30% of total sales in coming years. But the U.S. is on track to approve $40 billion in foreign military sales in fiscal 2016, down from $46.6 billion in fiscal 2015, Navy Vice Adm. Joe Rixey told Reuters at Farnborough.Still, demand from Asia is growing, and orders from the Middle East should help coming in despite an oil prices pressuring government coffers there.Earlier this month, the Pentagon announced that Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system will be stationed in South Korea by late 2017. And Japan is considering Lockheed and Boeing (BA) for a fighter jet order worth up to $40 billion.Saudi Arabia's Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman met with Lockheed and other defense executives last month during his trip to Washington, as the kingdom buys missile-defense systems and bombs amid conflicts in Yemen and Syria.
"
378,UTX,"Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 could be deployed to Europe and the Pacific without notice as a show of force, according to a top Air Force official.In similar displays, Lockheed F-22s were sent to Lakenheath, England, for a surprise training mission to show adversaries that the U.S. has ""the rapid ability to move airplanes,"" Gen. Herbert Carlisle, head of Air Combat Command, said after a congressional hearing Wednesday, according to Bloomberg.""As soon as I get them operational, I'd like to do that with the F-35s as well, to demonstrate that I can move those airplanes anywhere I need to as rapidly as I can to support combatant commanders' needs -- whether it's in a peacetime training environment, messaging to potential adversaries, or if we ever had to, in the face of conflict,"" he said.Lockheed shares ended virtually flat in the stock market today. Northrop Grumman (NOC), a major subcontractor on the F-35, dipped 0.3%.IBD'S TAKE: Despite Thursday's moves, defense stocks have been in buy range recently and showing strength amid recent market volatility.Meanwhile, the Air Force's version of the F-35 is on track to be declared combat ready this year.There are no technical issues that would delay the F-35A from receiving its initial operational capability status in the current scheduled time frame of August to December, Carlisle said, reiterating prior remarks from the Air Force.There have been some major issues with the plane's development over the years, leaving it behind schedule and over budget.A problem with a United Technologies (UTX) Pratt & Whitney engine forced the fleet to be temporarily grounded in 2014, but the Pentagon said it has since resolved those issues. The plane has also seen problems with its Autonomic Logistics Information System and software issues.The Marine variant of the fighter, the F-35B, was declared combat-ready last July and will be sent to Iwakuni, Japan, in early 2017, but the Marines said the jet is capable of deploying the F-35 to the Middle East for combat, if necessary.The Navy's version, the F-35C, is expected to be combat-ready between 2018 and 2019. It will conduct a third round of shipboard tests aboard the aircraft carrier USS George Washington in August, according to a report from Defense News.""They're going to open up the full envelope of the airplane to land and take off from the carrier, which means things like heavyweight, asymmetric stores, heavy cross winds, high seas,"" Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, F-35 program manager, said. ""Plus we'll do a lot of reliability, maintainability and maintenance administrations to make sure we get that right.""
"
379,UTX,"United Technologies (UTX) stock has finally formed its first pattern of 2016, and it's been working through a flat base for going on two months.The question is: Can United Technologies move into a buy range where other large diversified manufacturers such as 3M (MMM), Honeywell (HON) and General Electric (GE) are currently positioned?United Technologies makes aircraft engines via its Pratt & Whitney unit, as well as Otis brand elevators, heating and security systems and other aerospace components and systems. Its stock took a drubbing early in the year but it's risen 25% since hitting a 2016 low at 83.39 on Jan. 20.It's following similar patterns by 3M, maker of various medical supplies and office supplies, and Honeywell, which makes automotive and aerospace systems. They both sank early this year in sync with the sharp early-2016 market pullback and then recovered. Shares of both recently climbed into record territory.General Electric, largest of the quartet with roughly $119 billion annual sales, hasn't slipped this year but continued its slow, steady climb as it transforms into what it calls a digital industrial company, rolling out its Predix Industrial internet operating system and industrial manufacturing software. Its stock, though, is still well below its all-time high.Mining equipment giant Caterpillar (CAT), with $43.8 billion annual sales, has moved into buy territory as well. Like United Technologies, Caterpillar is forming a first-stage flat base, and it has an 80.99 buy point. Its stock has risen on hopes that the long commodities price slump is nearing an end amid higher prices for crude oil and some metals.While 3M, Honeywell and GE are in buy range, United Technologies is working its way through that flat base. Shares were on track for a fifth straight higher close on Tuesday amid new contacts and announcements at the Farnborough Air Show in England. Just before the show, on July 8, Pratt & Whitney received a contract valued at $1.5 billion from the Department of Defense to manufacture F135 engines for all three variations of the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter jet.IBD'S TAKE: United Technologies and a number of other big-name industrial stocks are in buy range, but many don't have high composite ratings from IBD. For a listing on the highest-rated stocks, try IBD's MarketSmith.However, on Monday Qatar Airways at the show said it was looking at buying 30 Boeing (BA) 737s in place of Europe's Airbus Group's (EADSY) A320neos. The carrier canceled delivery of one A320neo saying it found glitches in the Pratt & Whitney engines. Qatar Airways has been in talks with the CFM joint venture between GE and France's Safran S.A. to provide an alternative engine but no deal had been reached as of early Tuesday.United Technologies shares were up 0.5% at 104.50 in Tuesday afternoon trading on the stock market today. It was trading in the upper half of the first stage flat base, with a 107.17 buy point.GE rose 0.2%, Honeywell 0.4% and 3M 0.7% Tuesday.

380,UTX,"It was a huge week for earnings. Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) all beat forecasts, while McDonald's (MCD) and Ford Motor (F) indicated some weakness in U.S. demand. Tech M&A stepped up, including a Verizon (VZ) deal to buy Yahoo's (YHOO) core assets. The U.S. economy is growing a lot slower than expected, and oil prices are nearing $40 a barrel.The Nasdaq composite rose 1.2% to its best levels since early December, fueled by strong earnings from Apple, Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon.

EPS jumped 94% to 97 cents, shattering consensus for 82 cents. It was the fourth straight quarter of accelerating earnings growth. Facebook stock rose 2.4% to 123.94, hitting a record high and still within range of a 121.18 buy point.Twitter (TWTR) reported Q2 EPS that topped views. But revenue fell short, and Q3 revenue guidance also missed estimates. Twitter stock fell 9.4% but closed the week above its 50-day line.Bouncing back from a Q1 miss, Alphabet reported Q2 EPS and revenue that blew past expectations. The Google parent's earnings minus items rose 20% to $8.42 a share. Total revenue climbed 21% to $21.5 billion. Despite Google's size, it's still delivering growth, says Mark Mahaney, analyst at RBC Capital. ""This is now the 18th straight quarter of 20%-ish year-over-year revenue growth, and did we mention acceleration?"" he said in a report.Alphabet stock rose 4.2% to 791.34, closing just above a 791.05 entry point after rising as high as 803.94.Ford Motor sent a signal that the long auto industry bull market is over, as U.S. auto sales stall, and higher incentives hit profit margins. The No. 2 U.S. automaker's Q2 earnings per share and revenue rose, but EPS growth was weakest in five quarters, sales growth was the slimmest in three quarters, and Ford cited ""downside risk to global growth."" Offering further evidence of slowing, auto parts maker Lear (LEA) missed on sales and warned on 2016 revenue, while Gentherm (THRM) earnings missed.

Policymakers said ""near-term economic risks ... have diminished,"" suggesting a baby step to raising rates, and some analysts said it opened the door, slightly, to a September rate increase. But after the Fed meeting and weak GDP data, investors pushed back their expectations for the next hike beyond the next 12 months.The U.S. economy rose at a 1.2% annual rate in Q2, less than half of what Wall Street expected, after Q1's downwardly revised 0.8% pace. Consumer spending was very strong, climbing 4.2%.But residential investment fell, even as separate reports show new- and existing-home sales hitting multiyear highs. Business investment contracted for a third straight quarter. With oil prices falling back toward $40 a barrel, corporate spending may remain weak going forward.U.S. crude oil futures tumbled 5.9% to $41.60 a barrel, hitting three-month lows as the crude tumbled 13.9% for July. U.S. crude and gasoline supplies rose again, according to the Energy Information Administration, which also reported higher U.S. production. The number of U.S. oil rigs in operation rose for a fifth straight week, suggesting further production gains. But a glut of gasoline and refined products, suggesting less refinery demand for crude ahead. Meanwhile, Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and ConocoPhillips (COP) reported weaker-than-expected results.Mobileye (MBLY) reported Q2 EPS jumped 70% to 17 cents, while revenue grew 51% to $83.5 million. Both topped views. The maker of driver-assistance systems said that its relationship with Tesla Motors (TSLA) is ending. That news sent Mobileye down 8% on Tuesday, but the stock pared losses for the week to 3.4%. Tesla rose 5.6%.Boeing (BA) reported its first quarterly loss in years due to various charges, but it wasn't as deep as feared. Free cash flow was better than expected on big jet deliveries. Northrop Grumman (NOC) reported modest earnings and sales growth that topped views, but weaker tech services revenue hurt margins. Raytheon (RTN) beat views and raised profit guidance. General Dynamics (GD) topped on earnings and raised EPS guidance, but Q2 revenue missed.McDonald's earned $1.45 a share, beating analysts' expectations for $1.38. Total revenue fell 3.6% vs. a year earlier to $6.265 billion. Analysts had expected $6.27 billion. Global same-store sales, excluding currency effects, rose 3.1% vs. estimates for about 3.6%. U.S. same-store sales rose just 1.8%. Management said they were ""not immune"" to consumer unease -- be it over finances, the election or, in general, ""an unsettled world"" -- that may have hurt other restaurants during the quarter.Shares fell 8.3% to 117.60 for the week, tumbling through their 50-day and 200-day moving averages -- and a 124.18 buy point.Stifel Nicolaus downgraded a large number of restaurant stocks, while Jefferies predicted a U.S. recession would hit the sector. Top-rated Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), which reports earnings in the coming week, fell 6% on Wednesday. But the steakhouse chain found support at its 50-day line and closed the week down 2.3%.United Technologies (UTX), maker of Pratt & Whitney brand aircraft engines, Otis elevators and other products, reported second-quarter earnings per share and revenue that beat estimates and raised its Q3 EPS estimate. Its stock hit a one-year high at 108.49, above a 107.07 buy point. Caterpillar's (CAT) Q2 EPS and revenue both fell as the mining and construction equipment giant deals with an energy and mining downturn. Its stock hit a roughly one-year high at 84.29, rising above an 80.89 entry point. Chemicals giant DuPont (DD), which is merging with Dow Chemical (DOW), crushed earnings estimates but was light on revenue. Shares rose to 69.87, the highest point since mid-December, triggering its 69.50 buy point.

Citrix was already planning to spin off Go To Meeting.Verizon Communications acquired struggling the core assets of Yahoo for nearly $6 billion, including $1.1 billion in stock compensation costs. ""Despite the massive execution challenges ahead, the Yahoo acquisition demonstrates that Verizon recognizes its own limitations as a consumer brand,"" said research firm The Diffusion Group. Verizon reported Q2 revenue that missed views and in-line EPS, and added fewer wireless postpaid phone subscribers than expected.T-Mobile US (TMUS) in Q2 added 646,000 postpaid phone subscribers, topping Sprint (S) at 173,000 and Verizon's 86,000. AT&T (T) lost 160,000 postpaid phone subscribers. T-Mobile's earnings fell 40% but still beat expectations. Revenue rose nearly 13% to $9.2 billion. ""TMUS revenue growth continues to significantly outpace peers,"" said Matthew Niknam, a Deutsche Bank analyst, in a report.Under Armour (UA) met top-line and bottom-line expectations when it reported per-share earnings of a penny, down 75% from the prior-year Q2, and 28% revenue growth to $1 billion. The Nike (NKE) rival announced several assertive plans, including its takeover of the FAO Schwarz space in Manhattan, as well as a partnership with Kohl's (KSS). But shares tumbled 7.9% for the week.Amgen (AMGN) beat and raised, but its stock slipped as its growth continued to be driven by price increases rather than volume. Celgene (CELG), meanwhile, jumped as only a third of its growth was price-driven, making up for a hit earlier in the week when its drug Revlimid failed a lymphoma trial. AbbVie (ABBV), Merck (MRK) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) also rose on solid reports. AstraZeneca (AZN) was the biggest winner stock-wise when it jumped 9% Thursday on rumors that Swiss pharma Novartis (NVS) was thinking of acquiring it. The biggest loser was Gilead Sciences (GILD), which trimmed its guidance as its hepatitis C franchise continued to decline.Meanwhile, top-rated medical device companies Edwards Lifesciences (EW) and orthopedics giant Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) each hit new highs after beating estimates and raising guidance. Big Cap 20 stalwart Boston Scientific (BSX) hit a 10-year high after it reported its strongest quarter of sales growth in nearly a decade.

Apple (AAPL), Panera Bread (PNRA) and U.S. Steel (X) are a few names due to report in a busy after-hours session.McDonald's dropped 3% at the open after its second-quarter earnings bested analyst estimates, but revenue just missed and same-store-sales were far short of consensus views. McDonald's is in the 12th week of a cup base -- which eventually could lead to a breakout of the stock -- started after shares notched a record high in May.Texas Instruments (TXN) bolted 7% after a strong second-quarter beat.Las Vegas Sands (LVS) rose 4% at the open.  The casino owner reported its first year-over-year revenue gain for Sands China in two years, buoying speculation that the Chinese gambling hub of Macau may be showing signs of revival and overshadowing otherwise weak second-quarter results.Israel-based Mobileye (MBLY) opened down 10% and is currently off 8.5%. The maker of camera-based autopilot technologies for cars rose briefly in premarket trading after reporting strong second-quarter results. But Mobileye Chief Technology Officer Amnon Shashua said during the company's quarterly conference call with analysts that Mobileye's relationship with Tesla Motors (TSLA) would not go further than the EyeQ3 processor currently used in Tesla models.

384,UTX,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) rose to record highs Thursday, triggering buy points as Raytheon (RTN) continues to stay in buy range.Defense contractors were touted as Brexit plays, as global markets sold off, but the group has mounted an offensive even as ""risk-on"" trading resumes, at least somewhat.Lockheed shares rose 1.7% to 248.27 in the stock market today eclipsing its buy point of 245.47 and setting a new all-time high. Analysts were initially worried that the U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union could hit orders of Lockheed's F-35. The U.K. is one of the international partners on the F-35 and the new fighter jet will make its international debut at the air show in Farnborough in July. Several NATO allies also plan to buy the stealth fighter.Japan is mulling a fighter jet order worth up to $40 billion, with Lockheed Martin and Boeing (BA) among those invited to take part.Northrop shares climbed 2.3% to 222.28, moving above its buy point of 218.94 to a new highRaytheon (RTN) rose 0.5% to 135.95, still in range after retaking a 130.09 buy point.General Dynamics (GD), Boeing and United Technologies (UTX) also continued to rise Thursday though their shares are significantly off recent highs.General Dynamics stock is up 2.7%, retaking its 200-day moving average but still well off its August 2015 peak. U.K. operations account for less than 5% of total revenue.Boeing shares are up 2.3%. Boeing is trading below its 50-day and 200-day lines. Boeing has a defense arm but relies mostly on commercial passenger jets.United Technologies stock climbed 2.1%, back above its 50-day line after finding support above its 200-day line earlier this week. United Tech generates ""20% of its revenue from European operations"" according to a Citigroup note last week and has had the greatest exposure to ""Brexit"" worries in the defense sector.

385,UTX,"Shares of General Electric (GE) and other big U.S. industrials fell  Friday amid concerns about the strong dollar and the possible effect on trade from Britain's vote to leave the European Union.General Electric stock fell 4.3% to 29.82 in the stock market today, undercutting the 50-day moving average. Aircraft engine, elevators and heating and cooling systems maker United Technologies (UTX) slid 3.4% to 98.89.Aerospace and defense giant Boeing (BA) dropped 5.3%, and automotive and aerospace supplier Honeywell (HON) lost 3.7%. 3M (MMM), a leading provider of tapes, adhesives, medical items and office supplies among other products, was off 2.9%.Automakers were also slammed amid the market turmoil. General Motors (GM) slid 4.9, Ford Motor (F) was down 6.6%, Toyota Motor (TM) reversed 5.45% and Volkswagen (VLKAY) skidded 6.85% to 28.71.Both the euro and the pound plunged vs. the dollar, with the latter falling to a 30-year low after hitting a six-month high earlier Thursday, and the euro suffering its worst decline on record. Prior to the Brexit referendum, U.S. manufacturers were already grappling with the effects of a strong dollar, which makes their goods more expensive overseas. Many economists are predicting a U.K. recession, with Europe barely growing in the near term. General Electric early Thursday had for the first time provided details of its strategy to transform into a digital industrial company, and its plan to make its Predix industrial operating system the platform of choice for manufacturers around the globe.Chief Digital Officer Bill Ruh said at an investor event in Silicon Valley that he sees the company's digital business, including software and its Predix OS, generating about $7 billion in revenue this year and $15 billion by 2020. That's up from an earlier estimate of $10 billion.GE announced Thursday that Cerberus Capital is bidding for its French consumer finance business, GE Money Bank. Analysts said that bid could put GE in position to free itself of the designation of being a Systematically Important Financial Institution, or SIFI, which imposes stringent regulations.The confusion in global markets after Britain's vote to exit the EU could put that deal in less favorable light for Cerberus. GE's stock has been forming a first-stage flat base for about two months, and that base was still intact Friday, although its share price slid toward the bottom of that range Friday.

386,UTX,"Stock indexes opened modestly higher Tuesday, fending off pressure from pullbacks in gold and oil prices.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.1% while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 added 0.2%.Stocks in motion included United Technologies (UTX), United Continental (UAL), Lennar (LEN), CarMax (KMX) and Barclays (BCS).While the United Kingdom's vote on Thursday determining its membership in the European Union is dominating the week's news, the central news item for investors on Tuesday and Wednesday is likely to be Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen's testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday. She is scheduled to begin her testimony at 10 a.m. ET.The economic calendar is otherwise quiet on the stock market today, except for comments scheduled from Federal Reserve Board Governor Jerome Powell in New York at 2:30 p.m. ET.More than half of the Dow's stocks moved higher ahead of the open. United Technologies led with a premarket gain of nearly 2%. The index's losses narrowed to less than 0.5%.Homebuilder Lennar muscled up more than 2% after its second-quarter earnings, and revenue topped consensus expectations by comfortable margins. Smaller peer KB Home (KBH) is scheduled to report earnings after today's close. Lennar's chart could be read as a long cup base with a 56.14 buy point. But a 32% climb between February and April set the stage for a shorter, shallow base, which offers possible buy points at 48.02 and 49.06.CarMax tumbled 3.5% at the open on a first-quarter report that stopped just shy of consensus projections.United Continental popped 5%. Management revised the airline's second-quarter passenger revenue guidance lower and announced a restructuring aimed at generating $3.1 billion in revenue and efficiency gains by 2018.American Science & Engineering (ASEI) spiked 14% on news that OSI Systems (OSIS) would acquire the maker of X-ray inspection systems in a deal valued at about $269 million. OSI shares opened 6% higher. Both stocks are thinly traded.European banks were once again busy before the open, with Barclays up about 3%, and Credit Suisse (CS), Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and Deutsche Bank (DB) were up 1% to 2%.Oil prices slipped nearly 2%, putting West Texas Intermediate just below $49 a barrel. Gold was more than off 1% to below $1,277 an ounce. The dollar rose vs. the yen and was effectively steady against the euro. Bonds held all but flat.Overseas markets were quietly mixed. In Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 posted the strongest move, up 1.3%. Benchmarks in London, France and Germany were moderately higher entering afternoon trade.

387,UTX,"Lockheed Martin (LMT), Raytheon (RTN) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) were among the few stocks holding up as markets fell Friday on the U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union.Lockheed shares closed down just 0.1% at 239.70 in the stock market today. The stock is nearing a buy point of 245.47. But orders of Lockheed's F-35 fighter jet could take a hit over ""affordability"" issues, according to Citi analyst Jason Gursky, writing in a note Friday cited by Barron's.The U.K. is a major international partner on the F-35, and several NATO allies also plan to buy the stealth fighter.Raytheon shares rose 0.9%. Northrop Grumman shares dipped only 0.9%. But General Dynamics (GD) stock fell 2.6% to 136.14. General Dynamics has U.K. operations, but they  account for less than 5% of total revenue.Boeing (BA), which has defense operations but largely relies on commercial passenger jets, fell 5.3% on worries over air travel demand. (Boeing's European archrival Airbus (EADSY) lost 10.7%).Citi wrote that United Technologies (UTX) has the ""most material Brexit exposure"" in the companies in the defense group, as it generates ""20% of its revenue from European operations.""United Technologies shares tumbled 3.4% to 98.89. United Tech is a supplier for the Eurofighter Typhoon, Lockheed's F-35 and Northrop's Global Hawk drone, which is seeing international demand.
"
388,UTX,"General Electric's (GE) fuel-efficient LEAP aircraft engine program is unlikely to break even until 2019, Cowen & Co. said in a research note Tuesday, citing massive discounts wrested by airlines and GE's battle with United Technologies (UTX) to build engines for Boeing (BA) and Airbus (EADSY) depressing prices.Airlines ""routinely pay 70% below list prices"" for single-aisle airplane engines, Cowen found, meaning LEAP engines probably sell for around $3.7 million apiece on average, as opposed to their $13 million list price. The LEAP engines are made by CFM, a joint venture run by GE and French engine maker Safran.Meanwhile, rival engine-maker United Technologies has kept adjusted list prices for its single-aisle aircraft engine, the GTF, lower than the LEAP, Cowen found. United Technologies has been eager to reclaim its place in single-aisle aircraft markets after CFM became the main engine provider for Boeing's 737, Cowen said.""New airplane programs are developed infrequently, so winning now is important to UTX, as opportunities may not present again for 10+ years,"" Cowen analyst Gautam Khanna wrote in the note.General Electric shares closed up less than 0.1% on the stock market today. Boeing finished essentially flat, and U.S.-listed shares of Airbus rose 0.2%. United Technologies added 0.1%.Cowen, in the research note, initiated coverage of GE with a market perform rating and a 29 price target.General Electric offloaded financial assets over last year and has tried to become more of an industrial tech firm. But Cowen said the company's EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) compound annual growth rate could lag Wall Street's 5% consensus for 2018 due to growing pains in its aviation and power segments.As General Electric and United Technologies rush to lock down engine orders, Boeing and Airbus have been been battling to sell more fuel-efficient planes to airlines.In the meantime, airlines have held on to older and cheaper planes, anticipating three more years of cheap oil before the fuel-efficient planes come online, Bloomberg reported.But Airbus has suffered engine problems and long delays to deliveries, prompting Qatar Airways last week to drop its first order for the Airbus A320neo amid problems with a United Technologies Pratt & Whitney engine. The carrier said it could abandon more orders and threatened to opt for rival jets from Boeing or an A320neo powered by the LEAP engine.GE currently has a high market share of engines for single-aisle jets, Cowen said.Khanna wrote that GE's market share ""will be a positive"" once aftermarket gains kick in during 2024 or later.

389,UTX,"U.K. stocks like BP (BP) and AstraZeneca (AZN) were hit hard by the U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union, and there was trouble across the pond too as U.S. air carriers like Delta Air Lines (DAL) and banks like Citigroup (C) were among top stock losers of ""Brexit.""Lloyds Banking Group's (LYG) U.S.-listed shares plunged 23% in the stock market today. Those of Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) fell 27.5%, and Barclays (BCS) sank 20.5%. HSBC (HSBC) lost 9%.Other big banks outside the U.K. were hit as well. JPMorgan (JPM) was down 7%, Bank of America (BAC) lost 7.4%, Citigroup was off 9.4%, Morgan Stanley (MS) fell 10.15%, and Goldman Sachs (GS) retreated 7.1%.Airlines fell over worries that an economic slowdown in the U.K. and EU would dampen demand for travel. United Airlines (UAL) shares plunged 9.1%, Delta was down 8.2%, and American Airlines (AAL) tumbled 10.8%.BP shares pared losses and were only down 4.8% in the afternoon, with the oil giant formerly known as British Petroleum saying it would keep its headquarters in the U.K.""However, we do not currently expect it to have a significant impact on BP's business or investments in the U.K. and Continental Europe, nor on the location of our headquarters or our staff,"" BP said, according to Reuters.Oil tumbled on the news amid worries of a global economic slowdown that could cut demand. U.S. crude was down 5% to $47.69.Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) tumbled 6.4%. Exxon Mobil (XOM) slumped 2.6%, and Chevron (CVX) gave up 2.4%.Among other U.K. stocks, pharmaceutical firms AstraZeneca and  GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) lost 4.9% and 4.1%, respectively.

390,UTX,"Shares of Boeing (BA) rival Airbus (EADSY) tumbled after Qatar Airways said it scrapped its first order for one of Airbus' A320neo planes and could cancel more following months of software and engine-related problems with the jet.That's bad news for United Technologies (UTX), who owns Pratt & Whitney, which produces many of the engines for the single-aisle, fuel-efficient planes. But it could represent an opportunity for Boeing and General Electric (GE) and French engine-maker Safran, who run a joint venture that also produces an engine for jet.Qatar Airways said it would think about purchasing A320neos with the engine from the joint venture and could also go with Boeing's 737 Max, according to the Wall Street Journal.U.S.-listed shares of Airbus closed down 1.8% in the stock market today. Boeing rose 0.4%. United Technologies dipped 0.4%, and GE also lost 0.4%.Qatar Airways' decision to abandon the order follows months during which the carrier publicly aired its dissatisfaction with the A320neo delays.“It is making a huge impact on my bottom line,” Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker said, according to the Journal. “We are quite frankly screaming.”In April, Al Baker was more subdued, but not by much.""We have talked to Airbus, they know very well that we're a very unhappy, very unhappy customer,"" he said, according to Reuters.Near the end of last year, Qatar Airways, who was set to be the first to receive the planes, decided not to take the first A320neo order until Pratt & Whitney removed some operational restrictions on the engines. German carrier Lufthansa, who was next in line to receive the first jet, also didn't get it when promised. Other problems with the engines have followed.Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Airlines (UAL) are among the possible suitors who could fund and then eventually buy Panama-based carrier Avianca, the Journal also reported.If a merger agreement takes hold, it would continue the worldwide trend in recent years of airline consolidation. Such consolidation has helped filter out competition and temper capacity growth in an industry that has been plagued by bankruptcies over the decades and often accused by Wall Street of undisciplined expansion.Alaska Air Group (ALK) in April said it would buy Virgin America (VA). That combination could help box rival JetBlue (JBLU) out of the West Coast but present challenges given Virgin's struggles to compete on profitability and lower fares.Delta shares were down 1.9%, with United also down 1.9%. American Airlines (AAL) gapped down 3.4%.

391,UTX,"Critics have said trying to develop and build Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 simultaneously is a major flaw in the program, but top officials said giving the plane to operators is ""probably the best thing"" for furthering development.Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, top Pentagon weapons tester Michael Gilmore and others have questioned the F-35's ""concurrency."" The Government Accountability Office also said in multiple reports that high levels of concurrency were a major driver of increased costs and schedule delays.But Lt. Gen. Chris Bogdan, the F-35 program’s executive officer, told reporters late Tuesday that getting the F-35 to initial operating capability (IOC) with the Marines last year, without full war-fighting capabilities, has helped the joint program office learn more about pilot and maintenance crews' requirements and other issues with the plane.""Despite the limited capability the airplane has today, getting it in the hands of the warfighter and having them use it is probably the best thing we can do to further development,"" he said.The Air Force will weigh a similar trade-off as its version of the F-35 nears IOC. Top Pentagon procurement officer Frank Kendall said that milestone could still come between August and December.Bogdan has been a proponent of getting the plane ready for IOC by Aug. 1. But issues with the aircraft’s Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) will drive the schedule, he said.Right now, four of the five updates will be ready in August or September, but integrating engine information into ALIS won't happen until October or November.""We presented that information to the Air Force and will let the Air Force decide what they choose to do,"" Bogdan said. ""It's entirely possible to deliver all of the deployable capabilities without the engine capability, but that's a decision the Air Force will have to make.""Sean Stackley, the Navy's acquisition chief, noted the F-35 program office can tailor ALIS updates to address specific needs from the field.""This is a case of a complex system that is maturing much quicker now that the operators have their hands on it and can point us to some things that are highest priority to them,"" he said.Lockheed shares dipped less than 0.1% on the stock market today. Northrop Grumman (NOC) and United Technologies (UTX), which are major subcontractors, fell 0.2% and rose 0.4%, respectively.

392,UTX,"With a major order from Delta Air Lines (DAL), Canada's Bombardier is ready to disrupt the Boeing (BA)-Airbus (EADSY) duopoly, according to a report Tuesday from Moody's.Earlier this year, Bombardier scored an order for 75 narrow-body CS100 jets from Delta, with an option for 50 more. It was the largest-ever order for Bombardier's commercial aircraft business, and Delta is expected to become the biggest C Series customer, Moody's said.Delta likely chose the Bombardier jets over Boeing and Airbus models, as Bombardier ""has the earliest availability for planes of this type, given the huge backlogs of Boeing and Airbus,"" and the Canadian company offered a steep pricing discount.Bombardier also ""likely has the most technically proficient model in this class of aircraft,"" focused on the 100-150 seat market. The plane features a new geared turbofan engine from United Technologies’ (UTX) Pratt & Whitney division that Moody's says offers a cost advantage over its peers.Airbus ended 2015 with a backlog of 6,787 aircraft with a total value of $996.3 billion at list prices, beating Boeing for the second straight year. Boeing’s year-end backlog was 5,795 commercial jets, but it didn’t give a list-price value.Boeing shares closed down less than 0.1% in the stock market today. Airbus jumped 2.7%. Delta added 1.6% and United Tech rose 1%.Meanwhile, Boeing faces a growing threat from its main rival. While its market share has topped Airbus' 60% to 40% for the past 10 years, Airbus has been winning more narrow-body orders and will catch Boeing in total deliveries by 2018, Moody's said.

Airbus has seen slow deliveries of its new A320neo and A350 aircraft.Boeing shares climbed 2% to 134.72 in the stock market today, moving aback above its 200-day moving average. Airbus shares closed up 2.1% to 15.76.The A320neos -- which adds an acronym at the end of its name to denote a ""new engine option"" -- have been plagued with problems on those very motors from Pratt & Whitney, a division of United Technologies (UTX). Meanwhile, the A350s have issues with their cabin equipment. Airbus has only delivered six A320neos and six A350s so far this year.United Tech shares rose 2.1%.April orders were up for Airbus, helping push the European aerospace giant to 117 orders between January and April.

395,UTX,"United Technologies (UTX) and A.O. Smith (AOS) said they're seeing signs of economic improvement in China, which could lead to higher orders later this year.Aerospace, elevator and security systems maker United Technologies said early Wednesday that first-quarter earnings per share minus one-time items fell 10% to $1.42 compared with Q1 2015, beating estimates by 3 cents. Revenue slid 8.1% to $13.36 billion, better than the expected $13.18 billion.CEO Gregory Hayes told analysts on a conference call that he expects rising activity in China in the second half of the year. That could boost orders for Otis Elevator and the company's climate controls and security products businesses. The company said it also sees signs that the equipment market is bottoming in China as units orders rise.New equipment orders for Otis rose 1% in the quarter at constant currency, and grew 6% excluding China. Equipment orders at UTC Climate, Controls & Security shrank by 8%, mainly due to a difficult comp in the refrigeration business.At its Pratt & Whitney aerospace unit, commercial aftermarket sales jumped 19%. The company said it sees aftermarket sales of aircraft parts rising as plane retirements slow and airlines fly planes longer.United Technologies shares rose 1% in the stock market today. The diversified manufacturer reiterated guidance. Its stock has been consolidating for about 10 months and as of Wednesday had risen 27% from the 83.39 low point of the trough on Jan. 20.A.O. Smith, a water heater maker, reported a 28% jump to $73.5 million, or 83 cents EPS in Q1. Revenue dipped 2.5% to $636.90 million. Wall Street expected 76 cents EPS and $645.6 million revenue. ""China growth remained strong with sales up 17% in local currency in Q1 during the first quarter, thanks to increased sales of water heating, water treatment and air purifier products,"" Chairman and CEO Ajita Rajendra said in a written statement.A.O.

As Russia and China posture aggressively, global tensions are ratcheting up. That could mean heady times are in store for defense stocks.ITA is trading 2% below a buy point of 125.95, off an extended saucer base.Its 37 stock holdings include Boeing (BA), United Technologies (UTX) and Lockheed Martin (LMT). They're generally manufacturers of commercial and military aircraft, as well as other defense equipment.The ETF has $690.9 million in assets and a 0.43% expense ratio.Trading volume is decent, at roughly 64,000 shares a day.ITA's Relative Strength line is rapidly climbing, which makes it a good candidate for a stock watch list. The RS line measures how a stock is performing vs. the S&P 500 index.In another technically bullish sign, this ETF has been riding an air cushion above its 50-day moving average since late February. By comparison, SPY has chopped around that key line of strength this month.ITA saw $41.2 million in net outflow over the first four months of 2016, but sentiment could be turning around. The weekly chart shows heavy buying on the right side of the flat base, which means institutional interest is stepping up.The last time ITA broke out of a base, in October 2014, it ran up roughly 10% in a matter of four months.Not every breakout from a basing pattern is successful, but buying on breakouts helps increase the odds of a successful advance.First Trust ISE Cloud Computing (SKYY) broke out of a flat base in November but sank hard soon thereafter. However, after a July 2013 breakout, this exchange traded fund ran up nearly 30% over the following eight months.It's now within 1% of another potential breakout from a first-stage cup-with-handle base, with a 30.05 buy point. Look for the ETF to move up through the handle’s high on heavier-than-normal volume.SKYY also boasts decent volume, at approximately 83,000 shares a day. The ETF holds $517.4 million in assets and has a 0.60% expense ratio.Its 34-stock portfolio includes IBD Leaderboard stocks Facebook (FB) and Amazon.The technical picture holds some cautionary signs. Volume is weak on the right side of the consolidation. Potential buyers need to consider SKYY's Accumulation/Distribution Rating of D. That rating indicates heavy institutional selling in recent weeks.The RS Rating of 61 is underwhelming too.ITA has produced a 16.6% annual average gain over the past three years.SKYY gained an annual average 10.1% in that period, and SPY rose 9.2%.

400,UTX,"General Electric (GE) said Friday that first-quarter industrial revenue dipped as the collapse in oil prices weighed, but its digital unit saw sharp growth amid the conglomerate's tech transition.GE earned 21 cents per share, up from 20 cents a year ago and better than forecasts by 2 cents. Revenue declined 5% to $27.85 billion, but that topped estimates for $27.62 billion. Adjusted industrial revenue dipped 1% to $23.58 billion.GE shares fell 0.7% in the stock market today, finding support at their 50-day line. The stock climbed above a first stage cup-with-handle base with a 30.69 buy point on March 17. It's struggled to remain in buy range in the past month.""GE had a good performance in a slow growth environment,"" CEO Jeff Immelt told analysts on a conference call. ""We're in the midst of a challenging oil and gas market. However, we're seeing sustained strength in aviation and power markets, and health care is rebounding.""Revenue from its oil and gas segment dropped 18% to $3.31 billion, and its transportation business plunged 25% to $981 million. But power revenue climbed 13% to $5.2 billion, aviation jumped 10% to $6.26 billion, and health care rose 3% to $4.18 billion.Among its faster-growing segments, renewable-energy revenue surged 62% to $1.67 billion, energy connections spiked 34% to $2.26 billion, and digital leapt 29% to $1.2 billion.""That's still a small part of their $27 billion-plus quarterly revenue,"" Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau said of the digital segment. ""But it's a real fast growing area for them.""GE is reorganizing into what it calls a digital industrial company, focusing more on selling technology services and software. In Q1, GE opened its Predix digital platform for general availability, and more than 7,500 developers have registered for it.On Thursday, GE Digital and Oracle (ORCL) announced a strategic partnership to build what they called a ""first of its kind"" platform for companies to digitally connect industrial assets.Meanwhile, GE's order backlog climbed 18% to $316.1 billion in Q1. That includes $28.8 billion worth of orders from Alstom, the French industrial giant whose power business GE bought in November for $10.6 billion, its largest industrial purchase ever.GE reaffirmed that it expects 2%-4% organic revenue growth in 2016, with sales expected to accelerate in the back half of the year. It also confirmed earlier EPS guidance of $1.45-$1.55 for the year, in line with analyst views.Windau isn't worried about the Q1 drop in industrial revenue growth, saying that has been seen broadly in the industrial sector as oil and gas has been a headwind for a couple of quarters with lingering currency effects as well.""It's a positive that they stuck by their guidance,"" he added. ""That's baking in a pretty decent improvement in the back half of the year.""Along with its digital shift, GE continues to shed other businesses. In January, GE agreed to sell its home appliances business to China's Haier Group for $5.4 billion. Immelt said Friday that GE has inked deals to sell $166 billion of its $200 billion GE Capital businesses and is ahead of schedule on divesting that business.As GE repositions, other diversified manufacturers considered big moves too. Earlier this year, Honeywell (HON) revealed that it had tried to buy United Technologies (UTX) for more than $90 billion. But Honeywell ended its pursuit in March due to United Tech's unwillingness to engage in talks.On Friday, Honeywell also reported quarterly results.

401,UTX,"Markets abhor uncertainty. And perhaps nothing breeds more uncertainty than a war that starts with a surprise attack like the Korean War in the early 1950s.To the investor, wars create volatility and opportunity. You do not have to be able to predict such events from happening. But you do need to be flexible and know when to quickly raise cash to avoid huge losses in stocks. Then you must be able to buy with conviction when the market, via the follow-through bottoming signal, has given investors a green light to buy leading new stocks.IBD teaches such techniques via this column and the Big Picture. Market timing is essential to making great trades.On June 25, 1950, the North Korean People's Army surprised South Korea and a small contingent of U.S. military personnel, pouring south across the 38th parallel. The next day, North Korean tanks were at the outskirts of the South Korean capital of Seoul.The day after that, President Harry S. Truman secured a United Nations resolution calling for military assistance to the South. Truman named Gen. Douglas MacArthur to head two U.S. divisions in what he called a ""police action."" For the next three years, the U.S. would fight a difficult and costly war to an eventual standstill that lasts to this day. Kim Jong-un, the grandson of Kim Il-song, the supreme leader who launched North Korean forces against the South, is in charge today, still raising havoc in the region.The Monday morning after the attack, the Dow fell 4.7%. The next day, the market lost 0.8%, with volume reaching the heaviest since September 1939, when Hitler invaded Poland. From a June 12 intraday high to a July 13 low, the Dow lost 14.8%. Yet the correction was contained; the Dow had just about recovered its loss by September, when U.S. forces launched the Inchon invasion and the liberation of Seoul.The Korean War had important consequences for the economy. Rather than build deficits, Truman preferred a pay-as-you-go strategy. Supported by Congress, he raised income, corporate and excise taxes to record levels in 1950 and 1951.At the war's outbreak, inflation skyrocketed as consumers hurried to buy, fearing shortages. Prices rose 11% from the war's onset until price controls were imposed Jan. 26, 1951. In its last year, war expenses made up 14.1% of GDP.Dwight D. Eisenhower  was elected in November 1952 on a platform of ending the war. An armistice went into effect July 27, 1953.The advance once the war was underway was mild and choppy. Still, some winners emerged. One winner was United Aircraft Corp., later United Technologies (UTX), which owned the Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Engine Co., maker of jet engines used in fighters and bombers. It broke out of a cup-with-handle base in 1949. By 1953, 87% of sales were to the government. It gained 256% in 169 weeks.Better bets surfaced at the end of the war when price controls and materials restrictions were lifted. Enter Outboard Marine, a maker of outboard motors. It expanded its offerings to include snow blowers, lawn mowers and chain saws and saw earnings and stock price explode.Following a strong breakout in January 1954, Outboard gained 720% in 177 weeks, ascended into a climax run on a 3-for-1 stock split and gave a clear sell signal.

403,UTX,"China's latest headline economic figures show that growth is stabilizing and even accelerating, giving a boost to U.S. multinationals and global activity overall. But China's reliance on debt-fueled stimulus may not be sustainable, analysts warn.China grew 6.7% during the first quarter vs. a year earlier, the smallest gain in seven years, Beijing reported Friday local time. But that matched estimates and was only a slight deceleration from Q4's 6.8% expansion.  Also, other economic reports, including retail sales and industrial production, found growth accelerating in March.But even setting aside the usual doubts about whether Chinese economic statistics can be trusted, some analysts worry that China's economy is being propped up by increasing financial leverage and escalating real estate prices.""It could take a few years before that is exposed -- as we know from our own economy in the last slowdown,"" according to Gil Luria, managing director and analyst at Wedbush Securities.The U.S. exposure to China is somewhat limited, comprising barely 1% of U.S. GDP. But stronger Chinese growth could be a boon to U.S. corporate giants, from Apple (AAPL) to United Technologies (UTX) to Starbucks (SBUX).Meanwhile, U.S. and other global stock markets have rallied strongly from early February lows.Crude prices have moved back above $40 a barrel, along with big gains in iron ore and steel prices. That's bolstered commodities-sensitive industries.""The indirect price effect is the most important channel through which Chinese growth affects the U.S.,"" according to William Adams, senior international economist at PNC Financial Services.But questions remain about China, Adams said. In Q1, the three major sectors of the economy -- agriculture, industrial and services -- decelerated from Q4 more than the aggregate growth rate.Retail sales grew 10.5% in March, picking up from 10.2% in February, but China includes government purchases in that number, making it somewhat unclear if actual consumer spending is accelerating.Meanwhile, government measures bolstered China's flagging real estate sector, which had been hampered by a glut of development.Investment in fixed assets such as factories and buildings grew 10.7% in Q1, better than expected. Cement production climbed 24% last month compared to a year earlier. Crude steel production gained 2.9% in March compared to the 5.7% decline during January and February.But private firms' investment rose just 5.7% vs. 23.3% for state-owned businesses. China's state-owned enterprises tend to be less efficient than the country's dynamic private sector.Social financing, which includes bank and nonbank lending, soared to a record high in the first quarter, raising concerns that China has been throwing money at the problem.Still, after a bumpy start to the year, China's policymakers have engineered a soft landing, steadied the yuan and slowed capital outflows.""Chinese fiscal stimulus has cushioned the first quarter slowdown and has reduced the downside risks to near-term global growth,"" Adams said.The world's No. 2 economy is in a well-publicized and long-term transition from an industrial, export-based economy to one led by services and domestic demand. The Chinese consumer's share of GDP rose two points year over year to 56.9%, but that remains far below U.S. numbers.Reform plans to rationalize laggard SOEs have been mooted; Beijing is wary of reforms that would cut millions of jobs. Next year, a lot of provincial officials are up for potential promotions or demotions, according to Sung Wohn Sohn, an economics professor at California State University, Channel Islands. They don't want to risk weak economic figures or widespread labor unrest.Accelerating growth in China and improved global financial markets, even in the short term, should give the Federal Reserve hawks a little more impetus to tighten U.S. monetary policy.""They're more likely to raise interest rates now,"" Sohn said.

404,UTX,"Headlines haven't been kind to Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35. ""America's Most Expensive Fighter Jet is Also Its Worst,"" Maxim wrote. ""Report: The F-35’s Pilot Eject System Could KILL You And Definitely Will Maim You,"" according to the Daily Caller. ""The Pentagon's Official F-35 Bug List is Terrifying,"" said ExtremeTech.Government reports of the $400 billion program have also been scathing. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain is a major critic, and Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has said he'd consider dropping the program if he gets elected.But a Marine pilot who has been flying the F-35 for nearly four years feels differently, even if some bugs still need to be worked out.""I love the airplane, and it's great to be flying something that's newer,"" Maj. Brendan Walsh told IBD.He previously flew F/A-18C Hornets, which debuted in the 1980s, but he's now flying a so-called fifth-generation fighter with stealth technology.""Even in today's battlefield and even with what some people call immaturities on the F-35, I would hands down rather be in an F-35 than an F-18 in just about any situation,"" Walsh said.The Marine Corps declared the F-35B variant combat ready in July, and Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 121, the ""Green Knights,"" became the first squadron to become operational with an F-35.Since then, the Marines have been preparing for the F-35's first deployment to Iwakuni, Japan, next year.A short, expeditionary runway comprised of metal sheets was used at a Marine Corps base in Twentynine Palms, Calif., to practice short take-offs and vertical landings (STOVL).""The STOVL is awesome,"" said Walsh, who is the operations officer for the Green Knights. ""We can deploy fifth-generation platforms in decentralized areas that make it hard for the enemy to target.""The F-35 has come a long way since Walsh started flying it four years ago. For example, it now takes Walsh eight minutes to hit the runway for take-off, comparable to the F/A-18, and down from two hours when he first started flying the new jet.He is also impressed with the F-35's stealth, among other features, and is confident that even more advanced capabilities will come later.""The radar has performed well, the surveillance systems and electronic surveillance systems have performed very well, even in this configuration of the airplane, and they are only going to get better,"" Walsh said.But while Walsh prefers the F-35 over his old jet, a dogfight in the new aircraft could be problematic.Last year, the military blog War Is Boring reported that an older General Dynamics (GD) F-16 outmaneuvered the F-35 in an air-combat test, setting off a firestorm of criticism.But the Pentagon has since said the F-35 wasn’t equipped with its full array of avionics, helmet mounted display or compete stealth coatings. It also is trying to downplay dogfighting, saying that's not the F-35's main mission.Another fifth-generation stealth fighter, Lockheed's F-22 Raptor, was designated primarily as an air superiority fighter. But it was canceled less than halfway into its production run as costs soared, leaving the Air Force with only 187 operational planes.The F-35, which will have three versions for the Air Force, Navy and Marines, is seen as a multirole fighter, with production expected to hit 2,443 for the U.S. services and more than 900 for international customers.Meanwhile, China has been developing the J-31 fighter, which is believed to be made from stolen F-35 plans, and a new long-range air-to-air missile. Russia also has been expanding its radar and weapons capabilities.But given its advanced features, Walsh doesn't see the F-35 doing much turning and burning against other fighters. “If you’re in a dogfight in this airplane, you did something wrong, because you should have killed everyone way before you got there.""Still, he said, there have been “better performances recently” in dogfighting match-ups, based on what he's heard from operational testers, and those tests are still ongoing.Other issues continue to hang over the F-35 program. Last month, at a House Appropriations Committee hearing, Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Robert Neller said that he has “concerns about where the software was"" and wanted Lockheed to hurry up with fixes.The Pentagon's chief weapons tester has pointed out glitches in the Autonomic Logistics Information System, which helps manage diagnostics, maintenance and supply-chain issues.Walsh's squadron tested the troublesome system, considered the ""brains"" of the F-35, in December, and it set up the complex server in a remote area in Twentynine Palms.""I have full confidence that we can deploy the server and go somewhere if we have to,"" Walsh said. ""I had no issues with it from a pilot's point of view, getting into the system and signing for the aircraft and screening it as appropriate for flight.""An evaluation of the ejection system also found that it's possible lightweight pilots could break their necks while ejecting. A fix is in the works, and Deputy Defense Secretary Bob Work recently said he is confident ejection issues with lightweight pilots will be resolved. Also, until a software upgrade next year, the F-35 can't fire its 25 mm cannon.But the evaluation of one warfighter who would fly the F-35 into combat is clear: ""I feel way more survivable and way more lethal in the majority of mission sets in this airplane than with anything the Marine Corps has in the air right now,"" Walsh said.

Here's what you need to know:The iPhone maker, which reports after the close on Tuesday, is expected to log a 14% per-share profit decline to $2 on a 10% revenue fall to $51.97 billion. Just how much iPhone sales will tumble from last year is on investors' minds ahead of the earnings report, with consensus at sales of 50 million units vs. the prior year's Q2 sales of 61.17 million iPhone units.Apple shares dipped 0.6% Monday but remain slightly above their 50-day line after losing support at the 200-day level on April 15.The first defense contractor to report, Lockheed Martin is expected to post a 5.5% decline in per-share earnings and a 12% revenue rise to $11.34 billion. Investors and analysts will closely inspect the performance of Sikorsky, a 2015 acquisition from United Technologies (UTX).Lockheed shares are attempting to break out after building a three-month-wide flat base with a 228.01 entry point. The stock edged down fractionally Monday to 226.30.The tobacco giant's earnings are seen growing 16% to 50 cents a share as revenue is expected to rise 42% to $2.93 billion, the latter of which would mark the third consecutive quarter of more-than-40% sales growth.Reynolds American, a major dividend stock, closed the day up 1.2% to 48.41 but has yet to retake its 50-day line after slicing below that key support level in mid-April.Wall Street sees the social network's profit rising 43% to a dime a share.

408,UTX,"When commercial and military aircraft parts wear down, Heico (HEI) is often the go-to supplier for replacements -- and lately more of those parts have been showing their age.It's for a good reason, though. They're getting used more, thanks in part to lower oil prices.""With lower oil prices, airlines are continuing to fly the older aircraft more; they’ve slowed down their rate of retirement substantially,"" Kenneth Herbert, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, told IBD. ""Older planes are much less fuel-efficient than new ones, but with oil at $40 a barrel rather than $100 a barrel, the higher cost of operating older aircraft is not nearly as bad.""That's just one of the reasons Heico is doing barrel rolls right now. Heico is drawing revenue from a number of sources, and sales are expected to accelerate from single-digit growth last year to double-digits this year.Part of that will come from an acquisition of a parts supplier to military helicopters, but in Heico's first fiscal quarter, which ended Jan. 31, the higher growth rate had already started showing up. Revenue grew 14% over the prior year to $306.2 million. Adjusted earnings rose 20% to 49 cents a share.The company raised its 2016 forecast on revenue and now expects growth of 14% to 15% vs. 8% to 10% previously, equating to $1.35 billion-$1.38 billion. It also raised its forecast for net income growth to 10% to 13% from 8% to 10%. Analysts expect total revenue to climb 15% this year to $1.37 billion, while per-share earnings are seen rising 16% to $2.28 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.Heico has the benefit of drawing business from both the commercial and military side of aerospace. So if there is a reduction in military spending, its commercial side can pick up some of the slack. But that's not the case right now.""The U.S. defense budget is rising again,"" Victor Mendelson, Heico’s co-president, told IBD, adding that foreign military budgets in the Middle East and among some other U.S. allies such as South Korea and Japan are also rising. ""NATO countries are involved in Syria and other hot spots. If these places heat up, there is a need for things we make.""In fact, both sides of the equation are humming, Mendelson says.""Air traffic is up,"" Mendelson said. ""It means that there are more planes flying, and there is greater flight frequency. The more the aircraft is utilized, the more parts Heico delivers. It’s wear and tear.""Heico manufactures and distributes a wide range of aircraft replacement parts, including combustion chambers for engines, fuel shut-off valves, back-up power supplies for emergency exit lighting, power converters on GPS satellites and even underwater-locator beacons, or ""pingers,"" for cockpit voice and data recorders, commonly known as black boxes.""Everything we do is a highly specialized niche,"" Mendelson said.Heico's military group is the smaller of its two main business units, with the flight support group the biggest. Revenue in the smaller division grew 17% to $104.2 million, reflecting acquisitions since last year, as well as 4% organic growth.First-quarter sales in the flight support group, which includes commercial aviation, rose 12% to $204.6 million, even on softer organic sales in its repair and overhaul services product line, as well as a slowdown in South America.Mendelson's co-president is his brother, Eric. Their father, Laurans Mendelson, is chairman and chief executive. The three took over the company in 1990, when it had just $26.5 million in sales, and then began an aggressive acquisition strategy to expand the firm’s product line. The South Florida-based company took in nearly $1.2 billion last year.""We knew nothing about aerospace, manufacturing or engineering. We knew about business,"" said Victor Mendelson. ""We thought we had a good idea -- to expand the parts business.""Heico is a bit like a generic-drug maker. It provides low-cost copies of original products, which are regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration.""Our replacement parts demand is driven by aircraft use and the airlines’ need to save money,"" said Mendelson. ""Our replacement parts are sold for 20% to 30%, less than OEM (original equipment manufacturer) parts. We essentially copy the parts on the original plane.""Heico competes with smaller parts makers, as well as with the likes of General Electric (GE) and United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney division. Heico supplies parts for just about every airline in the world, including United Continental (UAL), American Airlines (AAL), Lufthansa, British Airways and JetBlue Airways (JBLU).Heico’s $255 million acquisition of Robertson Fuel Systems in January now provides it with crash-worthy auxiliary fuel systems for military helicopters such as Lockheed Martin's (LMT) Black Hawk and Boeing's (BA) Apache and Chinook. Management increased its outlook for its electronic technologies group -- where its military work is handled -- to reflect the Robertson acquisition.Though U.S. military spending is on the rise, proposed spending on some heavy helicopters will likely be pushed back another year. Still, Heico increased its revenue estimate in its electronic technologies group for the current year to growth of 27% to 30% to include gains from Robertson.""Because Robertson’s equipment has been made standard on more helicopters, that offsets the negative effect of fewer helicopters being produced,"" Victor Mendelson said.Robertson was Heico’s largest acquisition in a long string of buyouts, starting in 1990 when the company, under its new leaders, began to branch out from its original focus on aircraft engine parts.It’s made 60 purchases since then, eight of them last year alone. One was the purchase of 80% of privately held Aerospace & Commercial Technologies, which provides products and services to maintain the F-16 fighter fleet.About half of Heico’s revenue growth comes from acquisitions, and the rest from organic growth.""We’re working on a number of possibilities now,"" Mendelson said of potential candidates.

410,UTX,"Lockheed Martin’s (LMT) first-quarter revenue is seen rising, but international sales could take a hit on lower oil prices, and its new Sikorsky helicopter division may underperform.On Tuesday, the maker of the F-35 and F-16 fighter jets kicks off a busy week for defense contractors, with Northrop Grumman (NOC), General Dynamics (GD) and Raytheon (RTN) also on tap. Boeing (BA), which has substantial defense operations, reports Wednesday.Analysts see Lockheed reporting a 5.5% drop in EPS to $2.59, following a 5% drop in Q4. Revenue is seen rising 12.4% to $11.36 billion, helped by recent acquisitions.All eyes will be on the Sikorsky unit that Lockheed bought from United Technologies (UTX) last year. In a February SEC filing, Lockheed said that the business ""may underperform relative to our expectations” and that demand for helicopters and other products from the unit could be “adversely affected by global economic conditions, including oil and gas trends that are outside of its control.”At Lockheed's annual media day in March, CEO Marillyn Hewson said that the company is taking a more cautious tone on international sales to the Middle East and others dependent on oil prices. In the Q4 earnings conference call, Hewson said that plunging oil prices haven’t affected weapon sales to the Middle East and that countries heavily dependent on oil exports are cutting back in other areas.Lockheed may also give an update on the progress of getting a deal with the Pentagon on lots nine and ten for the F-35.On Friday, a Lockheed spokesperson told the Washington Post that the company would lay off ""less than 200"" workers in its IT division. The cuts come after the company said in November that it would lay off 500 employees as it divests the unit as part of its deal with Leidos (LDOS) to focus on its aircraft and weapons units.Lockheed shares rose fractionally on the stock market Friday, up 0.3% to 226.81. The stock has been moving sideways for the past two weeks, less than 1% below a 228.01 buy point in a consolidation going back to late November.Northrop Grumman results are on tap for Wednesday. The Global Hawk maker’s EPS is seen climbing 3.3% to $2.49, but revenue is expected to dip 0.5% to $5.93 billion. Congress is pushing the Pentagon to buy even more of Northrop’s B-21 bombers. Northrop Grumman shares broke to a new high in weak volume late last month but remain in buy range.General Dynamics will also announce results Wednesday. Analysts see EPS edged up 0.9% to $1.26 and revenue down 1.2% to $7.69 billion. General Dynamics stock rose fractionally Friday but has been trading below its 200-day line since early December.Raytheon rounds out the week on Thursday.  Analysts expect the maker of the Tomahawk cruise missile to report a 23% drop in EPS to $1.38 but revenue is seen climbing 3.2% to $5.46 billion. Shares are trading about 3% below their Dec. 17 peak of 129.99.
"
411,UTX,"When General Electric (GE) reports first-quarter earnings Friday before the market opens it will be as a radically different company than it was a year earlier.The industrial giant has been shedding its GE Capital financial businesses aggressively, and in January it agreed to sell its home appliances business to China's Haier Group for $5.4 billion as it dives deeper into technology, selling more software and services.Analyst consensus is for GE to report 19 cents earnings per share minus one-time items, a penny lower than the 20 cents it posted the same quarter in the previous year. It's only missed quarterly EPS estimates once in the prior two years. Analysts project revenue will fall 5.4% to $27.76 billion amid weakness in the energy and railroad industries and global economic uncertainty.Since announcing a few years ago that it planned to sell the bulk of its GE Capital businesses, GE has signed agreements for about $166 billion of the $200 billion in investments it plans to unload and now seeks to have its ""too big to fail"" label removed from its finance unit by federal regulators.Last week, GE announced that it had completed the sale of GE Capital Bank's U.S. online deposit platform, including all $16 billion of GE Capital Bank's U.S. deposits, to Goldman Sachs (GS) for an undisclosed sum.""With this sale, we are now in a position to fully exit the U.S. banking system by extinguishing our final U.S. bank charter and terminating our FDIC insurance, which we are targeting to complete by the end of this week,"" GE Capital Chairman and CEO Keith Sherin said in a statement last Monday.Meanwhile, GE in February launched a global partners network for its Predix operating system software, which is key for GE's ""Industrial Internet"" efforts. The network includes dozens of high-profile companies, such as Accenture (ACN), Deloitte Digital, Infosys (INFY) and No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC).GE's stock rose above a first-stage cup with handle base with a 30.69 buy point on March 17, and has remained in buy range. Shares closed up 0.3% in the stock market today.Among other industrial conglomerates, Honeywell (HON) also reports Friday, and United Technologies (UTX) is due to report April 27.
"
412,UTX,"3D Systems (DDD) received a much-needed vote of confidence from an analyst report Thursday, sending shares of it and Stratasys (SSYS) rising on hopes the top two 3D printer makers are poised for a rebound.Shares of both companies were hammered in 2015 as 3D Systems and Stratasys posted quarter after quarter of disappointing earnings and sales. In November, 3D systems announced that Avi Reichental had resigned as CEO and president after 12 years of leading the 3D printer pioneer. The company ran with an interim CEO until April 4, when 3D Systems announced it had recruited Vyomesh Joshi as CEO. Joshi had been executive vice president of the imaging and printing business of HP Inc. (HPQ) -- formerly Hewlett-Packard before its split. HP plans to enter the 3D printer market this year.Optimism about Joshi's hiring anchored the positive report from Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Wamsi Mohan on Thursday. Mohan upgraded 3D Systems stock to buy from underperform and raised his price target to 26 from 11.3D Systems stock rose 10% Thursday to 18.28, hitting its highest price since June. The stock had touched a more than five-year low of 6 in January.Stratasys rose 5.9% to 29.35 and hit its highest point since October. In February, it touched a more than six-year low of 14.48.Smaller 3D priner makers Voxeljet (VJET) and ExOne (XONE) rose 8.6% and 7.6%, respectively, with ExOne achieving a nearly one-year high, and Voxeljet missing a five-month high by a penny.Merrill Lynch did not distribute the research report to the media, but according to a summary of the report from 24/7 Wall Street, Mohan wrote: “Our buy rating on 3D Systems is predicated on the strong likelihood that the new CEO will turn around the business through a new direction and strategy based on his experience as an executive of HP’s established printing business.”Mohan expects Joshi can boost earnings by improving operational efficiency and refocusing investments, “even while end-market demand remains subdued.”3D Systems and Stratasys struggled last year. 3D Systems reported 2% revenue growth in 2015, to $666 million. At Stratasys, revenue fell 7% to $696 million. Revenue for both companies, year over year, declined in each of the last two quarters of the year, ending a long string of double-digit gains for the pair.Terry Wohlers, president of Wohlers Associates, which provides technical, market and strategic analysis on the 3D printer market, says Joshi earned a strong reputation from his work at HP.“People have a high regard for his leadership,” Wohlers told IBD. “He can take 3D Systems to the next level.""Despite a challenging year, revenue from 3D printers, supplies and services overall rose 26% in 2015, to $5.16 billion, according to Wohlers Report 2016, the latest edition of an annual publication dedicated to 3D printing. This year, Wohlers forecasts the market will grow 29% to $6.7 billion, and that it will rise 31% to $8.8 billion next year.Still, Merrill Lynch aside, most analysts continue to take a cautious tone on 3D Systems and Stratasys, even after both reported better-than-expected Q4 earnings. Observers in general are not convinced of a full-scale rebound, even as 3D printing technology is increasingly embraced by corporations, governments and universities. And it's not just observers who are wary. Executive of both 3D Systems and Stratasys have used a cautious tone when talking about 2016.Wohlers is not among the cautious crew, at least when looking down the road a bit.“If you view the industry through the lens of investors and share price, you will have a distorted view of what’s happening in the 3D printer market,” he said. The long-term future of the technology, he says, is strong.“Some of the biggest corporations and brands in the world are making significant investments in 3D printing,"" Wohlers said. ""We see a tremendous amount of activity that is advancing the industry.”The 3D-printer believers include Nike (NKE) and General Electric (GE). Nike has said 3D printing has revolutionized the way it designs and manufactures footwear. GE has made big investments in 3D printing, which it calls additive manufacturing. GE used 3D printers to develop complex fuel nozzles for its next-generation jet engine, known as Leading Edge Aviation Propulsion, in a partnership with France-based Snecma.Lockheed Martin (LMT), Airbus (EADSY), NASA and United Technologies (UTX) are also becoming bigger users of 3D technology.While the boom in 3D printing is good news for Stratasys and 3D Systems, it has also attracted more competitors. In 2015, 62 manufacturers sold 3D industrial machines, up from 49 in 2014, says Wohlers.HP's entry is expected to ripple through the industry. UBS analyst Steven Milunovich, in a March 31 research note, partly pointed to HP when he rated Stratasys as a sell, with a price target of 19.“The stocks of Stratasys and 3D Systems have jumped on a sequential Q4 revenue increase and outlook for slightly up revenue in 2016. However, we are becoming more concerned about HP's entry later this year,” which could have a negative impact on the two industry leaders, he wrote.Troy Jensen, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, said in a research report on April 11 that he recently met with HP executives.“We believe HP is in the late stages of alpha trials and is planning a controlled launch within the next few months with a limited number of partners,” he wrote.HP has said its printers will be faster, more efficient and cost less than products currently on the market.Many 3D printer companies are based in Europe. Besides Germany's Voxeljet, they include EOS Manufacturing Solutions, a fellow German firm and one of the largest 3D printer companies, with a wide range of 3D printers.

413,UTX,"ARLINGTON, Va. -- Lockheed Martin (LMT) said Tuesday it was ""optimistic"" about closing a deal for nearly 160 F-35s and is upbeat on cost reductions.Jeff Babione, the defense contractor's F-35 program general manager, said he expects talks for production lots 9 and 10 to be completed by the end of the month.""We are happy with how they are going,"" he said, though a decision on the production lots had been delayed due to the ""scale and complexity"" of the orders.The lots being negotiated are for 157 F-35 fighters, more than double the 71 airplanes under lots 6 and 7.Meanwhile, the Pentagon already has reached a deal with United Technologies (UTX) for 167 Pratt & Whitney engines in the upcoming F-35 lots.The F-35 is under fire for being over budget and behind schedule. Right now, the jet costs about $100 million each to make, but Lockheed thinks it can lower cost to $85 million in 2019.Babione touted the use of robots to help drive down costs. Engineers are using a robot to apply a coating on the fuselage, saving $6,000 per jet for a lifetime savings of $27 million. And robots are attaching nut plates with an estimated savings of $15,000 per plane or $46 million for the life of the program.But the biggest savings would come from a 450-jet bulk order, or block buy, which Babione estimates would provide $2 billion in savings, in addition to those seen from robots and other efficiencies.Lockheed had hoped for a block buy starting in 2018, but the Defense Department’s new budget request doesn’t include early funding or seek authorization for one. The Pentagon's chief weapons tester has said a block buy could mean large batches of faulty planes could enter service that will need several expensive fixes, resulting in no net cost savings.But partner countries and foreign military-sale customers could still start a block buy in 2018, without the U.S., if they let Lockheed know by June or July, Babione said.The price could fall even further, as Pratt & Whitney also is building the engines for Northrop Grumman’s (NOC) B-21 bomber.Lockheed shares closed up 0.5% in the stock market today. Northrop shares ended flat. United Tech shares climbed 1.25%.Amid the F-35 production, Lockheed is looking past its next-generation fighter and toward hypersonic propulsion.CEO Marillyn Hewson said the company is making progress with its hypersonic systems and could develop, build and fly a demonstrator aircraft the size of an F-22 for under $1 billion.""We’re now producing a controllable, low-drag, aerodynamic configuration capable of stable operation from take-off, to sub-sonic, trans-sonic, super-sonic, and hypersonic to Mach 6,"" she said.

It was the sixth-highest quarterly amount since FactSet began tracking the data at the start of 2005.As the top spender, Apple repurchased $6 billion worth of shares in Q4. Apple was also the leader in Q3 stock buybacks, at a whopping $15.3 billion in repurchases.The information technology group led all industry sectors in the S&P 500, with $33.2 billion spent on buybacks in Q4. Four of the top 10 companies were in the information technology sector, as FactSet defines it: Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL) and Visa (V).Information Technology and Consumer Discretionary sectors led buyback spending in Q4. https://t.co/tTsQkCDffj pic.twitter.com/Zn2aeo46yL— FactSet (@FactSet) March 18, 2016Following Apple for second place was United Technologies (UTX) at $5.1 billion, then Microsoft at $3.6 billion and Oracle at $3.25 billion.

Microsoft was close behind at $2.86 billion, followed by General Electric (GE) at $2.3 billion. General Electric came in sixth place in stock buybacks, at more than $3 billion.Share repurchase programs are a popular way of returning capital to shareholders, tending to boost a stock and per-share earnings, while dividends put cash in the hands of shareholders.In 2015, there were 70 activist campaigns in which a dissident objective was to return cash via dividends and/or buybacks, up 37% from 2014, Factset said in its report. This represented the highest total since FactSet began tracking the data in 2005. Of the 70 campaigns, activists were successful in 31, which was a record high.

417,UTX,"United Technologies provided more reasons the industrial conglomerate isn't interested in merging with Honeywell (HON), which detailed its $90.7 billion offer Friday.United Tech CEO Gregory Hayes said the company concluded that antitrust regulators either would block the merger or would drag it out so long as to “destroy shareholder value far beyond any synergies.”A merger also would hurt the company's operations, customer relationships and talent retention, he added.And the proposal “grossly undervalues (United Technologies) and overstates potential synergies,” he said in a statement.“Effectively, Honeywell’s proposal is a leveraged buyout of UTC using UTC’s own strong balance sheet,” Hayes added.Earlier Friday, Honeywell disclosed the terms of its bid. Had the offer been accepted, United Technologies shareholders would have received $42.63 a share in cash and 0.614 share of Honeywell, according to the presentation.Honeywell valued the deal at around $108 a share, or $90.7 billion, in the cash-and-stock offer, using Feb. 18 prices.Honeywell has described the potential deal as a ""significant synergy opportunity"" with ""significant value creation potential.""On Monday, United Technologies said it never explored a Honeywell merger because of ""regulatory obstacles, customer concerns and valuation issues.""The proposed deal also has drawn the criticism of Airbus (EADSY), whose CEO, Tom Enders, described the merger as not being in the aircraft manufacturer's interests. Honeywell and United Technologies are two of Airbus's biggest suppliers.Honeywell shares closed 1.1% lower on the stock market today. United Technologies stock fell 0.4%.

But United Technologies  is concerned about antitrust objections, with the Wall Street Journal later reporting that United Tech had rebuffed Honeywell on those grounds.Such a deal would create a combined company with $94 billion in sales.A  merger of the two companies that provide so much airplane material likely would face opposition from Boeing (BA) and Airbus (EADSY).

GE is alleging that Pratt's technology concepts are so broad that it shouldn't be allowed to patent them. The Fairfield, Conn.-based GE also is challenging a patent owned by Rolls-Royce (RR).The disputed patents have been issued from 2011 on and relate to the construction of gas turbine engines. General Electric alleges that Pratt's technology is little changed from the kind used in developing engines with NASA during the 1970s.As the market for global air travel is expected to expand, engine makers such as GE and United Tech are angling to boost their market share. GE filed the petitions with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, which a 2011 federal statute created. The PTAB is generally perceived to be friendlier to patent challengers than federal district courts are.GE shares fell 1.4% to 26.24 on the stock market today.

424,UTX,"The industrial sector continues to feel the pain, as evidenced by United Technologies (UTX), which reported sales declines in all four of its units during the fourth quarter as a strong dollar hurt its results.Excluding items, the Hartford, Conn.-based company earned $1.53 a share in Q4, down 8% from a year earlier. Including costs, United Technologies posted a per-share loss of 30 cents. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters forecast EPS of $1.52.

427,UTX,"New orders for big-ticket items fell sharply by 5.1% in December, the Commerce Department said, much more than the 0.2% monthly gain economists expected and worse than the most negative estimates, as low oil prices, a strong dollar and weak overseas growth kept hurting U.S. factories.Excluding transportation items, orders fell 1.2%, also worse than expected.Core capital goods, which exclude aircraft and defense equipment, fell 4.3% from November and slumped 7.7% compared to December 2014. The yearly decline was the biggest since February 2013 for the business investment proxy.Inventories rose 0.5%, lifting the inventory-to-shipments ratio to 1.69, matching cycle highs. The need for destocking at all business levels is expected to act as a headwind for the sector, likely reducing future output and dampening employment.Along with core capital goods shipments, the inventory data are a bad sign for fourth-quarter GDP. Commerce will release Q4 GDP figures on Friday morning.The grim durable goods report chimes with similarly negative regional reports from the New York Fed, Philly Fed and Dallas Fed, which have warned of trouble in America's manufacturing sector. The culprits have been strong gains in the dollar's value, which makes U.S. goods more expensive overseas, plus a contracting energy sector.The struggling industrial sector has impacted Caterpillar (CAT), which cut its sales outlook as it reported lower Q4 earnings today.

435,UTX,"The stock action in Amazon.com mirrored the movement of the Nasdaq composite as the general market struggled to strike a clear direction in late-afternoon trading Thursday.The Nasdaq composite edged lower in declining trade amid a seesawing session in which the premier index was up as much as 0.9% in the early going. It's trying to stop a two-day slide in which it dropped more than 2.5% on Tuesday and Wednesday.The S&P 500 nursed a tiny decline, off 0.3%, while the Dow Jones industrials was practically flat amid rising turnover on the NYSE in the stock market today. However, in the Dow, industrial names continued to rebound. Caterpillar (CAT), United Technologies (UTX) and General Electric (GE) were each up 2% or more, with Caterpillar seeing volume running more than 70% above normal levels.Amazon (AMZN), down fractionally, continues to struggle since its Jan. 28 fourth-quarter results. The 122% leap in profit marked a third straight quarter of handsome profits, but it still missed inflated Wall Street views. The 22% jump in sales actually marked a slight deceleration in growth from 23% gains in Q3. Still, the 22% gain beats the six-quarter average revenue increase of 19.2%.The stock's tumble since Jan. 29 has pressed Amazon to a critical test of its 200-day moving average, a key level of long-term support. On Wednesday, Amazon touched that 200-day line for the first time since the stock began its strong run with a breakaway gap on Jan. 30, 2015, busting out past a 341.36 entry point within a long bottoming base. Yet, as a weekly stock chart shows, the e-commerce and video streaming giant's long-term uptrend remains intact.Amazon has fallen as much as 25% from its all-time high of 696.44. A typical cup with handle or double bottom among great stocks tends to show a decline in the 20% to 30% range. So, a 30% drop from Amazon's peak would theoretically send the stock down to as far as 487.51.Wall Street is highly bullish about Amazon's future growth; EPS is expected to soar 283% to 4.79 a share this year and 80% to $8.60 in 2017. In 2008, the start of the Great Recession, Amazon earned $1.49 a share. The stock's D in SMR Rating (as seen in IBD Stock Checkup) is the product of poor return on equity. Yet Amazon has been given special consideration by equity analysts due to its over-achievements in innovation and infrastructure spending. The long-term debt-to-equity ratio was 62% in 2015, suggesting it's managing its debt well.Pacific Crest analyst Brent Bracelin reportedly predicts that infrastructure-as-a-service revenue will triple in the next few years.Elsewhere, large oil firms continue to struggle in 2016. While ExxonMobil (XOM) is working on a second straight gain, up more than 1%, rival ConocoPhillips (COP) sank more than 8% in nearly four times typical volume. The global oil and gas explorer lost 90 cents a share in Q4, sharply missing views, and announced a huge cut in its quarterly dividend, from 74 cents a share to 25 cents. Revenue slumped 43% to $6.77 billion. The stock is nearly 50% below its 52-week peak.

436,UTX,"Honeywell (HON) forecast strong earnings and revenue next year, driven in part by its acquisitions and coming in spite of some uncertainty in its end markets.The industrial conglomerate expects to earn $6.45-$6.70 a share in 2016, with the midpoint above consensus views of $6.52. Honeywell also sees revenue rising 4%-6% to $39.9 billion-$40.9 billion, above estimates of $39.5 billion.Shares closed up 5.7% on the stock market today.Among other diversified manufacturers, General Electric (GE) gained 2.2%, and United Technologies (UTX) added 2%.In a statement , Honeywell Chairman and CEO Dave Cote said the company expects 1% to 2% of core organic growth as well as segment margin expansion of 80 to 110 basis points.Honeywell sees growth in its fluorine products and transportation systems, but it will remain cautious as to sales planning in uncertain markets.Cote called it ""a credible and attainable plan"" to achieve the announced guidance. Recent acquisitions, such as the $119.5 million purchase of Sigma-Aldrich's research chemical business, also are expected to contribute to the company's forecasted growth next year.Follow Ciaran McEvoy on Twitter @IBD_CMcEvoy and on Facebook.

438,UTX,"As the Air Force readies 60-year-old B-52 bombers to prosecute the war against the Islamic State, a separate air war is looming over Congress amid opposition to the Pentagon's acquisition strategy for the B-21 bomber, which is supposed to replace the aging aircraft.Six years after an earlier attempt to update the bomber fleet was canceled due to high costs, the Defense Department awarded Northrop Grumman (NOC) the B-21 contract in October. Work was held up by a protest from the losing Boeing (BA)-Lockheed Martin (LMT) team, but the Government Accountability Office rejected it last month.Now the B-21, which could cost $50 billion-$80 billion, is taking flak from lawmakers over the Pentagon's use of a contract that leaves taxpayers on the hook for any cost overruns for the initial phase.“I remain seriously concerned about the acquisition strategy for the B-21 Long Range Strike Bomber, especially the use of a cost-plus contract for the development of this aircraft,” said Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, at a hearing earlier this month.When asked if he would use the defense authorization bill to block the contract, a McCain spokeswoman said the senator would ""consider his legislative options.""Cost-plus contracts have been used for programs -- like Lockheed's F-22 and F-35 as well as Northrop's B-2 -- that are now known for sky-high price tags. Production on the F-22 and B-2 ended early, due in part to ballooning costs.Despite McCain's concerns, the Air Force is moving ahead with its latest stealth weapon. Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch, military deputy in Air Force acquisition, said last week that the service decided to use a cost-plus contract for development because of risks associated with building a completely new airframe.The options for the first five production lots, which include 21 aircraft, are fixed price, meaning the contractor absorbs additional costs.But Andrew Hunter, director of the Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said there are also risks with using fixed-price contracts.General Dynamics’ (GD) F-111 attack aircraft, Boeing's C-17 transport aircraft, and Lockheed's C-5 transport plane were all fixed-price contracts that went well over budget, he said. The government then has no choice but to help out the industrial base or risk a ripple of bankruptcies from various suppliers, he added, drawing a comparison to the auto bailout.""Almost without an expectation, the government has had to pay extra,"" Hunter said of planes bought at fixed prices. ""The government has the decision to cancel the program and get nothing, or pay more to actually get the airplane.""Critics of the cost-plus contract point to Boeing's KC-46 refueling tanker, which is under a fixed-price contract. The aerospace giant has assumed over $800 million in after-tax charges on the plane due to higher-than-estimated engineering and manufacturing costs.But the Air Force's Bunch cautioned against comparing the B-21 with the tanker, pointing out that the KC-46 is a derivative of a commercial plane, Boeing's 767, and has potential for foreign sales. The B-21 has no commercial version and no prospects at this time for international sales to allies, he said.And while the B-21 will use mature technology, there are still risks from integrating the technology into a new plane, Bunch added.McCain also has issues with the Air Force not disclosing the full price of the bomber, though it puts the development cost at $23.5 billion and the per-plane cost at $564 million in 2016 dollars.""Why would you not want to tell the American people how you are going to spend their dollars?"" he asked March 8.The Air Force countered by saying it doesn't want enemies inferring the plane's capabilities based on price.But the B-21 isn't so secret that the Air Force can't disclose the identities of top subcontractors, who can help build more political support among lawmakers seeking Pentagon spending for their states and districts.They include United Technologies’ (UTX) Pratt & Whitney, BAE Systems and Rockwell Collins (COL).Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., a member of the Senate’s Appropriations Committee, said last week that he was pleased that the engines would be built at a factory in his home state, and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, echoed his sentiments.McCain's House counterpart, Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, told reporters earlier this month that he would like to see more mature technology on big-ticket programs, lowering the risk and need for cost-plus contracts. But he didn't voice a stance on the B-21 contract.Air Force Secretary Deborah James said the service will continue to “communicate” with Congress about the contract, as the B-21 “is a capability we need for the country.” The Air Force estimates an initial operational capability in the mid-2020s.While the B-2 is a stealth plane, it still lights up radars on Capitol Hill and in the Pentagon, as it looms over the latest bomber contract. Considered a poster child for Pentagon overspending, only 21 B-2s were built at a cost of more than $2 billion each.But James said she's learned from the B-2's failures, and the Air Force is taking a different approach with the B-21 this time.“The B-2 remained in the shadows for too long,"" she said. ""Too many details remained classified too long.""

439,UTX,"ARLINGTON, Va. -- United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney was selected as the engine maker for Northrop Grumman's (NOC) B-21 bomber, the Air Force announced Monday, and the service is OK with Pratt also building the engine for the F-35 fighter.At a Pentagon briefing Monday, Air Force Secretary Deborah James said Pratt is the new bomber's engine maker, beating out General Electric's (GE) aviation division.James said that there wouldn't be any issue with the company handling engines for both the B-21 and F-35 and that she was ""comfortable with our choices and our strategy.""Northrop won the B-21 contract, which could be worth $50 billion-$80 billion, for the B-21 back in October, beating out a Boeing (BA)-Lockheed Martin (LMT) team. But until Monday, the Air Force hadn't disclosed details about the other contractors.BAE Systems, Orbital ATK (OA), Rockwell Collins (COL), Spirit AeroSystems (SPR) and GKN Aerospace were selected as subcontractors for the airframe and mission systems.United Tech shares closed flat in the stock market today. GE lost 0.6%. Northrop shares fell 2.3%. Rockwell dipped 0.7%, Spirit closed down 2.7% and Orbital ATK fell 2.6%.Boeing shares closed up 1.5% to 122.90. Lockheed shares fell 1.3% to 215.84.James said there was a ""balancing act"" in sharing information with the public but also protecting information against cyber and other threats. The information about the subcontractors was released only after the companies had protection plans in place.""With the B-21 we are leaning forward and trying to be more transparent,"" she said.Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch, military deputy in Air Force acquisition, said the service would continue to be transparent with Congress about the program after Sen. John McCain threatened to block the bomber as long as it was was procured using a cost-plus contract.Bunch wouldn't give contract value or incentive amounts but said he would disclose more information about the bomber as it becomes available.
"
440,UTX,"Donald Trump used his prime-time Super Tuesday victory stage to vow that Apple (AAPL) would make iPhones in the U.S., ""not in China,"" if he is elected.He browbeat United Technologies (UTX)-unit Carrier and Mondelez (MDLZ)-unit Nabisco for moving hundreds of U.S. jobs to Mexico and Ford (F) for planning to double its production south of the border (though it continues to boost U.S. capacity too).Suffice it to say that multinationals don't relish the prospect of a president who stands ready to use the bully pulpit to sully their brands any time they move or expand production offshore, but GOP primary voters seem to like the idea.Trump's threats — to slap tariffs on Ford and United Tech's Carrier when they ship their products back into the U.S. and impose large tariffs on all imports from China for unfairly devaluing its currency -- have dominated the debate. None of the candidates is talking up the case for free trade -- the traditional stance of the GOP and most economists. The only thing that matters in this election is making the rules of trade more favorable to the U.S.In that context, President Obama's Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal — the biggest since Nafta — is too hot to touch and unlikely to get a vote before Election Day. Both Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz voted in favor of Trade Promotion Authority, allowing Obama to finalize terms of the deal with the assurance of an up-or-down vote in Congress without amendments. But Cruz has said he can't support the TPP in its current form and Rubio would rather talk about almost anything else.At the Detroit debate on Thursday, Rubio tried to turn Trump's populism against him: ""He can start tonight by announcing that all the Donald Trump clothing will no longer be made in China and in Mexico but will be made here in the United States.""Trump's uncomfortable response showed the limits of bad publicity, when business decisions are guided primarily by economics: ""They devalue their currencies, and they make it impossible for clothing makers in this country to do clothing in this country.""Trump hit back at Rubio for his support of the TPP, which he called ""a disaster for our country"" because of currency devaluation.Trump isn't likely to have any more success in getting Apple to make its iPhones in the U.S. than President Obama did, when he discussed it with Steve Jobs in 2011, due to the logistical and economic advantages of keeping the assembly in China.What about slapping tariffs on Ford and Carrier when they ship products back to the U.S. from Mexico? Could that be a game-changer?Only if Trump is prepared to risk tanking the American economy by canceling Nafta, says Scott Lincicome, international trade attorney and adjunct Cato Institute scholar. The trade agreement doesn't permit such tariffs, he notes.Declaring China a currency manipulator to slap big tariffs on imports of Chinese products also looks far-fetched. First, Congress, which has rejected more-modest measures of this sort, would need to go along. If it did, such a tariff would almost surely run afoul of World Trade Organization rules, Lincicome says. Yet, if Trump were somehow successful, nothing good would likely come of it.""All you would see is trade diversion,"" Lincicome said, with imports shifting to other low-cost producers like Vietnam.If Chinese imports did face a big tariff -- Trump has tossed around 45% -- then prices would soar for low-income customers in the U.S.What's remarkable about the state of the GOP debate is that it's happening even as China's central bank has been intervening in currency markets, deploying hundreds of billions of dollars to keep its currency from falling in value relative to the dollar. But the effort may fail. China is at risk of depleting its foreign reserves and economists are worried that the country will have no choice but to devalue by 10% or more to stave off a damaging outflow of capital.U.S. exports fell in January to their lowest level since June 2011. Imports have fallen less, but also are at 2011 levels, as the weak global economy is a drag on trade.Despite the powerful economic evidence that trade is a net benefit to the U.S. and that much of the loss of manufacturing jobs is related to productivity gains, even solidly pro-trade folks will acknowledge that the complaints aren't much ado about nothing.Of 5 million lost manufacturing jobs since 2000, Lincicome figures about 20% were trade-related, meaning the jobs were lost to other countries. In some industries such as apparel, where the number of factory jobs has plummeted by 80% in recent decades, the marketplace is clearly stacked against the U.S.But a good portion of job losses stem from high corporate taxes in the U.S. and more-stringent regulation, he says. That's where all the GOP candidates are in agreement to a large extent.Each of the candidates would cut the corporate tax rate, with Rubio slicing the current 35% rate to 25% and Trump slashing it to 15%.At Thursday's debate, Cruz touted his proposed 16% business-tax plan, saying that the tax would apply to imports but exports would be ""entirely tax-free.""""What that will do . . . is bring millions of manufacturing jobs back to this country, bring the steel industry back to this country, create an environment where when we compete on a fair and level playing field,"" Cruz said.

The service sector accounts for the vast majority of job growth, especially with manufacturing employment flat or falling for much of the past year.Meanwhile, factory orders rose 1.6% in January, the Commerce Department said. That's less than expected but still the most in seven months, driven by demand in commercial aircraft. Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, viewed as a gauge for business investment, rose 3.4%. Inventories fell for the seventh consecutive month.December's decline of 2.9% was left unrevised.Manufacturers such as General Electric (GE) and United Technologies (UTX) have suffered from a strong dollar and weak overseas demand.A struggling energy sector weighed on staff reductions last month, as Challenger reported 61,599 layoffs, down 18% from January's number.

443,UTX,"WASHINGTON, D.C.- The Air Force's  Chief of Staff is ""pretty confident"" that the Air Force's variant of Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 will meet its target date for combat readiness, but trouble with the engine's integration remains a major issue.At a House Appropriations Committee hearing Wednesday,  Gen. Mark Welsh said that while he sees the F-35A variant meeting its target initial operational capability (IOC) timeframe of Aug.1 to the end of the year, the plane still has some problems.The biggest issue right now is getting the engine data incorporated into the plane's Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) as the parts come from two different contractors. ALIS, which helps manage diagnostics, maintenance and supply-chain issues, is managed by Lockheed while the engine is built by United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney.Welsh said he expects to have the data integrated in July, giving the service a month to see how it works in operations before the IOC window opens.Lockheed shares fell 0.4%  to 217.20 in the stock market today. United Technologies shares edged up 0.5% to 95.53.Also Lockheed is working ""24/7"" on fixing problems with the fighter's software including radar stability issues, Welsh said.Last month, Lt. Gen. Chris Bogdan, the F-35 program’s executive officer, said that issues with how the software in the F-35’s sensors works with the main computer are a concern and if they aren't improved by the end of May, the Air Force might have to push back the IOC target date.Welsh said that Lockheed developed a change to fix the problem in the labs last month and will put it in the platform this month.The Air Force isn't the only service to have continued issues with the problematic F-35.At a House Appropriations Committee hearing Tuesday, Gen. Robert Neller, Marine Corps Commandant,  said that he has “concerns about where the software was” and wants Lockheed to “go faster.”  But Neller is still confident in the aircraft, saying it will get better as development continues and that his pilots are “very positive and very excited” about the plane.Still the Air Force has been hitting necessary milestones with the F-35 before IOC.  The service said that the F-35A dropped bombs for the first time in training last week at Hill Air Force Base in Utah.As for the Air Force's new B-21 bomber, Welsh didn't have any updates as to when more information about the engine maker and other subcontractors would be announced. Last week Secretary of the Air Force Deborah James said that more details would be announced in the coming weeks.Northrop Grumman (NOC) won bomber deal in October over a Boeing (BA)-Lockheed team, but few details have been released about the secretive program.Northrop shares fell 0.3% to 193.32. Boeing shares were down 0.3% to 119.65.

444,UTX,"Honeywell (HON) has scrapped its $90.7 billion bid for United Technologies (UTX), which said Friday that the offer undervalued United Tech, wouldn't pass muster with antitrust regulators and would ultimately harm the company.The decision to abandon the offer also follows trepidation over the deal expressed by Airbus (EADSY) and Boeing (BA), both of which are customers of the companies.Airbus' CEO said a merger between United Technologies and Honeywell was unlikely to ""be in the interests of Airbus,"" while Boeing said ""healthy competition in our supply chain is vitally important,"" according to the Wall Street Journal.Honeywell said it ""strongly disagrees"" with United Technologies' assessment of the offer and argued that the companies had been trying to get together for some time. The two companies, Honeywell CEO Dave Cote said, had been ""talking about a combination for more than 15 years.""""United Technologies felt the same way as we do when they approached us in May, 2011 and in April, 2015,"" Honeywell said in a statement.The company added: ""In our approach to their chairman and their CEO on February 19, 2016, we had hoped to continue amicable and quiet discussions of a combination. In fact, we were told by them during the meeting that such a combination would be fabulous, they would take it very seriously, and they would get back to us with questions within a week in anticipation of their upcoming board meeting.""However,"" Honeywell said, ""continuing to try to negotiate with an unwilling partner is inconsistent with our disciplined acquisition process.""Either way, Honeywell's acquisitive urges appeared to be intact.The company on Tuesday said it had bought RSI Video Technologies and Movilizer, which add video-verification security and cloud platforms that help manage workflow, to Honeywell's portfolio.The abandoned large bid for United Technologies and the two much smaller purchases come a day before Honeywell's investor day, when the company said it will present ""a terrific growth story for standalone Honeywell.""In a statement, United Tech said Honeywell's decision Tuesday is the ""appropriate outcome given the strong regulatory obstacles, negative customer reaction and the potential for a protracted review process that would have destroyed shareholder value.""United Tech shares closed down 1.6%. Honeywell climbed 4.5%. Boeing rose 1.5%, and Airbus added 3.1%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

An updated 3F version of the software will give the F-35 full war-fighting capabilities next year, including the ability to fire the plane's 25-millimeter Gatling gun.As of May 2015, 97.5% of the required F-35 software is currently flying and 99.9% of the required software has been coded, according to Lockheed's website. But about 10,000 lines of code still need to be written.The Marines F-35B variant was declared combat-ready in July and is set for deployment to Japan in early 2017.Neller is still confident in the aircraft, saying it will get better as development continues and that his pilots are ""very positive and very excited"" about the plane.But last month, a top Air Force official said the service might have to delay declaring its F-35A variant combat-ready unless issues with the software were worked out. The Air Force has an Aug. 1 target date set for the F-35A’s initial operating capability.But the Air Force's fighter reached a milestone toward combat readiness recently.

Honeywell sells about $331 million worth of brakes, wheels and air conditioning systems each year to Airbus.Airbus and its rival, Boeing (BA), have pushed suppliers to bring down costs.

"
526,UTX,"And so - let the confessions begin - or not......Yesterday - Citron Research - a firm that publishes negative research and actively makes bets against companies - made some very high-profile allegations against Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) using phrases like - ""web of deception"", ""Fraud"", calling it the ENRON of the pharmaceutical industry.....Now for those of us who actually remember the ENRON scandal - that was not good.... and or those of you who do not - let me outline it....
"
527,UTX,"At the height of its 'season' Enron was an energy, commodity and pulp and paper services company based in Houston, TX. Ticker symbol on the NYSE was ENE and it was one of the most actively traded stocks at the time.....Everyone wanted to be 'in' ENRON.....there was always a big crowd, big trades, lots of action.....Just the name caused your blood to pump and your brow to sweat.........and it was right outside of my booth... ..so the energy and excitement was never far away...... It was a company that claimed to have $100 bil. in revenues in 2000 and for 6 consecutive years was named one of ""America's Most Innovative Companies"" by Fortune magazine..... and then in December 2001 - they filed for bankruptcy and it all went POOF!
"
528,UTX,"Rumors had been building for weeks, questions raised, stories written....but remember - there was NO Internet, no Facebook, no Twitter.....so the news moved a bit slower....but it moved just the same....and then it was revealed...that all of that money and supposed financial condition......was nothing but a fraud.......I will never forget the action on the floor of the NYSE at the time - the stock crashed, dozens of brokers, vying for position, the roar of the market at work....the energy, the excitement, the tension, it was a broker's dream......it was the very definition of the functionality of the exchange....it was the very core, the heart and soul of capitalism........ and so today when something or someone is ENRON-like - it is accusing them of fraudulent and corruptive behavior....It is essentially a death knell......
"
529,UTX,"At about 10:13 am yesterday - the headline hit Twitter - Citron Research was calling 'VRX the pharmaceutical ENRON ' and the rest is history.....The stock crashed - Now the stock fell 30% in 30 mins......only to rally and then fall another 18% by 1:30.....Then Bill Ackman (large shareholder) comes out and announces that he was buying 2 mil more shares....and the company defends itself saying that the report is 'erroneous full of false and misleading statements'......""We categorically deny the allegations"".....Oh boy.....Now it's gonna get interesting..... The stock closed last night at $118.61 (down 28% on the day) and this morning in the pre-market , the stock is trading at $117...this is a story that is far from over.....so sit down and pay attention.....One day there will be a book written about this....
"
530,UTX,"So - that was all the excitement yesterday - pharma and healthcare - and that managed to cast a pall over the broader market...... The decline added to the market's losses from Tuesday and came on top of crude oil price weakness and investors focusing on the latest wave of companies reporting quarterly financial results. The lower close reflected ongoing concerns about corporate earnings and the outlook for the global economy. Now yes BA, and UTX did help to push industrial names higher but the broader market suffered under the negative tone created by the action in VRX and a buildup in oil reserves.......
"
531,UTX,"A DOE (Dept. of Energy) report showed an 8.0 mil barrel inventory build in crude oil, which is the highest weekly inventory build since April 3rd and dramatically higher than what was expected - this caused oil prices to fall $1.09 closing at $45.20. We are still holding within the range ($43/$50), but are now worried if the intermediate-term is looking more and more challenging as supplies continue to build. This morning - oil is trading up a bit - so the churn remains.
"
532,UTX,"As we have noted this is the one to keep your eyes on...a breach below $43 a barrel will bring more selling in the market despite all of the chatter that the Fed governors might say.
"
533,UTX,"Weak earnings continue to pressure stocks....and because earnings expectations have been lowered, when a company beats its expectations it doesn't necessary mean we're expanding - it just means that they beat lowered estimates - just like when you buy or sell a stock in pico seconds - it does NOT mean you did a good job...it just means you did it fast....
"
534,UTX,"So now 3rd quarter earnings for the S&P are coming in slightly better than expected....analysts are now calling for a 4.8% decline in profits - better than the original 7% decline they had prepared us for - this because 70% have beaten the estimate while only 40% are beating the top line.....(disconnect) .....Now 9 of the 10 sectors in the S&P 500 moved lower yesterday. Energy stocks fell the most on the back of weaker oil, industrials the only sector to rise thanks to BA and UTX......

Will they increase their current 1 tril Euro QE program? My guess is - not yet......FTSE flat, CAC 40 + 0.14%, DAX + 0.37%, EUROSTOXX + 0.33%, SPAIN +0.36% and ITALY flat.
"
537,UTX,"US futures are up 7 pts at 2015...I suspect that with oil a bit higher and the dollar flat - as long as we get better earnings the market will hold steady here....Resistance still holds at 2035.....with short term support right here at 2015.....if that does not hold - then look for 1980 to be the next real support level.

Gen. Jay Silveria in a Reuters report.The test will determine if the next-generation stealth fighter can be deployed to different locations for repair and maintenance.""What we’re trying to do is exercise the deployment concepts and to learn from maintenance and learn from (operations),"" Silveria told Reuters.So far, the jet has passed recent tests of sharing data with older jets, along with other F-35s.The Marine Corps declared its version of the F-35 combat ready in July and has plans to deploy it to Japan in 2017. The Air Force plans to declare ""initial operational capability"" between August and December.The F-35 contract was awarded to Lockheed in 2001, and the first planes were expected to be operational by 2010.

610,UTX,"Apple (AAPL) failed to live up to the lofty expectations of some investors in the June quarter, despite posting sales and earnings that beat Wall Street's targets.Unit sales of the iPhone disappointed, and Apple Watch sales appeared to be light.Apple (AAPL) stock fell 4.2% to 125.22 Wednesday. Apple late Tuesday reported its fiscal third-quarter results.Apple earned $1.85 a share, up 44.5% year over year and 4 cents ahead of Wall Street's target. Sales rose 32.5% to $49.61 billion, just above the $49.43 billion forecast by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Apple's Q3 revenue growth was its biggest increase in over three years.What follows are five key takeaways from Apple's mixed Q3 earnings report.1. iPhone unit sales disappointIn the quarter ended June 27, Apple sold 47.53 million iPhones, an increase of 35% year over year. But on average, analysts were expecting Apple to sell 49 million to 50 million.IPhone revenue, however, rose 59% to $31.37 billion, as customers bought more higher-end models such as the iPhone 6 Plus and handsets with more flash storage. Those models carry a higher profit margin.The average selling price for an iPhone was $660 in Q3, an increase of $99 year over year, despite a significant negative foreign exchange impact, Apple CFO Luca Maestri said.The iPhone business accounted for 63% of Apple's total Q3 revenue.On a conference call with analysts, Apple CEO Tim Cook boasted that the iPhone unit sales growth last quarter was almost three times the rate of growth of the smartphone market overall. Cook also said the iPhone saw its highest rate of switchers from Google (GOOGL) Android-based smartphones that the company has ever measured.Yet the company reduced its sales channel inventory for iPhones by about 600,000 units last quarter. On the call, Cook was asked why the company reduced iPhone inventory if the product is selling so well. He said cutting iPhone supply was a prudent business decision.""We always run with just the amount of inventory that we think we need,"" he said. ""Obviously the revenue could have been much higher if we would have expanded the channel.""Apple says the outlook for iPhone sales is bright because only 27% of iPhone users have upgraded to iPhone 6 series handsets. That figure was 20% in April.""We view that as a very bullish sign on the future, that there's a lot of headroom left for upgraders,"" Cook said.In a research report Wednesday, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi wondered whether Apple's Q3 results were ""a case of over-zealous expectations or the beginning of an inevitable slowdown.""Apple's Q3 results and guidance did not point to meaningful upside revisions ahead, Sacconaghi said. ""Moreover, investors also noted that Apple's conference call appeared less ebullient and a bit more defensive in tone than recent calls, that the company's (gross margin) beat was lower than recent quarters, and Apple did not hint at or signal any new imminent product or service introductions.""Apple also is going to face difficult comparisons with last fall's monster launch of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus starting this quarter, Mizuho Securities analyst Abhey Lamba said in a note Tuesday.""Apple's guidance seems to be supportive of our view that iPhone shipments could decelerate meaningfully in (the second half of the calendar year) with December potentially being the first quarter of year-over-year declines in iPhone shipments, which could make it tough for the stock to work,"" Lamba said.Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley says the lower-than-anticipated iPhone unit sales in Q3 and its cautious September quarter guidance are related to Apple lowering inventories ahead of the launch of the next model, the iPhone 6S.2. Apple Watch sales lightApple did not break out Apple Watch sales, but analysts dissecting the company's ""other products"" category determined that the smartwatch underwhelmed in its first full quarter.Wall Street analysts on average estimate that Apple sold 2 million to 2.5 million watches during Q3, vs. expectations for 4 million. On the high end, Deutsche Bank analyst Sherri Scribner thinks Apple sold 2.7 million Apple Watches last quarter. On the low end, UBS analyst Steven Milunovich believes Apple sold less than 2 million watches.Apple's ""other products"" category saw sales jump 49% in Q3 to $2.64 billion. Apple Watch accounted for well over 100% of the growth in the category, offsetting sliding sales of iPods and other products, Maestri said.Apple Watch sales have exceeded company expectations, despite being supply constrained, Cook said. He noted that the Apple Watch lacked a retail store presence until mid-June, which limited sales.Cook said Apple Watch sell-through was higher than the comparable launch periods of the original iPhone and the original iPad. And this was despite the fact that the Watch was only at 680 points-of-sale by quarter's end.He disputed reports that Apple Watch sales waned after the initial launch.""On the Watch, our June sales were higher than April or May,"" Cook said. ""I realize that's very different than what is being written, but the June sales were the highest. And so the Watch had more of a back-ended kind of a skewing.""Bernstein's Sacconaghi cut his forecast for Apple Watch sales in the current fiscal Q4 to 2.5 million units from 4.5 million. Apple might have to introduce a second-generation Apple Watch to drive meaningful sales during the holiday sales quarter, he said.The Apple Watch is available in 19 countries and will expand to three more countries this month. The smartwatch launched on April 24 in nine countries, including the U.S.Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Brian White said Apple Watch sales will be helped by expanded retail distribution going forward.""Apple Watch is only available at 680 points-of-sale vs. approximately 220,000 for the iPhone and 120,000 for the iPad,"" White said in a report Wednesday. ""Looking into fiscal Q4, we expect a significant ramp in the point-of-sale locations for Apple Watch.""Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster says the Apple Watch will be helped by the release this fall of the second-generation Watch operating system.That will allow for native apps on the device, which will improve the user experience.3. China a huge driver for AppleApple's growth in China remained robust, with sales more than doubling and comprising nearly 27% of total revenue in Q3.""Our results from Greater China were outstanding with revenue growth of 112% and iPhone unit growth of 87%,"" Cook said. Apple also saw healthy sales of Macs and from the App Store in China, he said.Apple's revenue in China reached $13.23 billion in Q3.Apple isn't seeing a slowdown in China despite the stock market turmoil in that country.Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri on Wednesday lowered his rating on Apple stock to market perform from outperform and cut his price target to 130 from 140. One of the big reasons for his downgrade is because ""evidence of a widespread demand reset from China is mounting.""In his report, he cited declining auto sales in China and earnings reports from United Technologies (UTX), Fairchild Semiconductor (FCS) and Linear Technology (LLTC), among other companies.4. Services gaining steamApple's services category, which includes iTunes, AppleCare, App Store and Apple Pay, became the company's third largest business in the June quarter. It had been the fourth largest, but passed the shrinking iPad business.Services sales rose 12% to $5.03 billion. Within services, the App Store's revenue rose 24%, Cook said.The services category includes Apple's streaming music service, Apple Music, which launched in June with three-month free trials.5. Mac sales up, iPads downApple's Mac computer sales rose 9% to 4.8 million units, in line with estimates.Mac sales have consistently outperformed the overall PC industry in recent years. In the calendar second quarter, Apple was the only major PC vendor to show growth in an overall down market, market research firm IDC said. Mac shipments rose 16.1%, while the overall PC industry saw shipments fall 11.8% worldwide, IDC said.But tablet sales continued to fall in Q3. Apple iPad sales fell 18% to 10.93 million units in the June quarter. IPad sales have fallen for six straight quarters.IPad sales could get a boost from enterprise sales through Apple's partnership with IBM (IBM) and a rumored larger-screen iPad Pro, Cantor Fitzgerald's White said.

611,UTX,"Lockheed Martin's (LMT) second-quarter results are seen falling when it announces Tuesday, but shares have been on the rise recently as the defense contractor's newest fighter jet nears combat readiness.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Lockheed's Q2 earnings to fall 3.3% to $2.67 per share and revenue is seen down 2.6% to $11.01 billion.Investors and analysts are waiting for Lockheed's F-35 next-generation fighter jet to finally be cleared for combat. The plane is well over budget and behind schedule. Lockheed won the contract in 2001 and expected to have it ready by 2010.The Marine Corps must carry out an operational readiness inspection on the F-35B version before declaring it combat ready. How well the plane does in testing and after becoming combat approved could affect its chances for a massive bulk procurement that could impact Lockheed's earnings down the road.The Pentagon is planning to ask Congress for a ""block buy"" order for up to 500 planes that could top $40 billion vs. current orders for small batches. Defense chiefs are looking for a three-year order starting in fiscal 2018.The block buy is key to addressing the program's cost, which lawmakers are looking to slash. The Defense Department plans to spend $400 billion for 2,443 of the new planes to replace aging F-16s, A-10s, Boeing (BA) F/A-18s and AV-8Bs.But the total number is now in doubt. Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Joseph Dunford, who has been tapped as the next Joint Chiefs chairman, told the Senate Armed Services Committee recently that the F-35 buying plan is under review.Meanwhile, Lockheed looks to build on its position as the top defense contractor. The company is reportedly the front-runner to buy the Sikorsky helicopter business from United Technologies (UTX).Lockheed also has been expanding its reach beyond aircraft and is building up its cybersecurity business. Washington has placed a focus on fighting cyberwarfare, and earlier this year the Pentagon opened an office in Silicon Valley. Cybersecurity accounts for 10% of Lockheed's revenue.Other defense contractors are eyeing the fast-growing sector too. Raytheon (RTN) bought Websense, a security firm, in April for $1.9 billion.Raytheon is expected to announce Q2 results Thursday. Analysts forecast a 2% increase in EPS to $1.62. Revenue is seen falling 3.9% to $5.48 billion.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

The S&P 500 inched down 0.1%. The Nasdaq struggled to hold a fractional gain.Small-cap stocks were showing some resilience, with the Russell 2000 up 0.4%.Volume was mixed, but not by much, sliding 10% on the Nasdaq and rising 1% on the NYSE, compared to action at the same time Monday.A morning of hectic stock action looked toward a busy after-hours session headlined by Apple's (AAPL) highly anticipated fiscal Q3 report.In the oil patch, Chevron (CVX) and ExxonMobil (XOM) notched the Dow's best gains, each up about 1% after two days of declines. Baker Hughes (BHI) rose almost 2% after reporting mixed Q2 results. The oilfield equipment and services heavyweight said it expected unfavorable conditions to continue across all segments for the remainder of the year. Halliburton (HAL) in November agreed to buy Baker Hughes for $34.6 billion.Qualcomm (QCOM) led the Nasdaq 100, up 2.6% after announcing Monday night that it would conduct a strategic review with an eye toward divesting portions of the company. The decision followed pressure applied by hedge fund Jana Partners, which in April announced a more than $2 billion position in Qualcomm. Qualcomm shares have been in a gradual downtrend for the past 12 months.Tesla Motors (TSLA) posted the worst loss among Nasdaq 100 stocks, dropping 3.5% after a downgrade, to sell, by UBS.A long list of companies were in motion after rolling out quarterly results. Citizens Financial Group (CFG) pared losses to less than 4%. Harley Davidson (HOG) surged 4%. Lockheed Martin (LMT) dipped a fraction. Verizon (VZ) dived 3%.United Technologies swooned 7% as a wave of analyst downgrades quickly followed its mixed Q2 results. The diversified aerospace giant reported earnings above analyst consensus views, but revenue fell 5%, more than expected, and management trimmed its full year profit outlook based on weakness in Europe and China. United, which is reportedly selling its Sikorsky helicopter unit to Lockheed for $9 billion, has been in a downtrend since February.On the IBD 50 list, CyberArk Software (CYBR) jumped 4%. The software developer is 24% below a June high, consolidating below its 10-week moving average after tumbling out of a breakout attempt.At the bottom of the list, NewLink Genetics (NLNK) dropped 4.7%. The Ames, Iowa-based biotech is well up the right side of a 38% deep correction.

613,UTX,"The long-range bomber contract may not force Boeing (BA) to buy Northrop Grumman (NOC), despite widespread expectations that it will trigger industry consolidation, according to a report from Citigroup analysts released Tuesday.Boeing, which has teamed up with Lockheed Martin (LMT), and Northrop are competing for a contract estimated to be worth $70 billion to $90 billion. A decision is expected this summer.The new bomber will be the only contract of note for a sophisticated military aircraft in the next 10 years, and analysts speculate that the loser could be forced out of the defense airframe business.Under some scenarios, if Boeing loses, it might buy Northrop to hold onto a piece of the military airframe market. If Northrop loses the bid, it would be an easy takeover target as it lacks any big programs.But not so fast, says Citi analyst Jason Gursky in a note.A Northrop buyout ""runs counter to BA's telegraphed cash deployment priorities for the next few years,"" he wrote, adding that Boeing instead has its eyes on other assets like United Technologies' (UTX) Sikorsky helicopter unit.Boeing has been vocal about its plans to return its free cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.Gursky also said the Pentagon is against consolidation in the industry so that it can maintain competition among contractors.While no one yet knows the outcome of the classified program, Citi said Lockheed's involvement with Boeing on the project could be in Northrop's favor, because the Department of Defense might not give Lockheed, which is already making the F-35, a piece of another major project.But preventing consolidation isn't a top focus for the Pentagon.If macro issues like consolidation weren't laid out in the original contract terms, they won't be part of the award consideration, Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia said in an earlier interview with IBD.Northrop's CEO also said consolidation would be unlikely.""I would be careful about making prognostications that the (bomber decision) alone has a reshaping impact on the industry,"" Wes Bush said in the company's Q1 conference call last week.Boeing and Northrop shares were flat in the stock market today.Related: Boeing Boeing Gone?

JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is advising in the strategic review, which UTC expects to finish by year-end.Sikorsky has $7.5 billion in annual sales as opposed to UTC's $65 billion sales overall. The unit, which relies on defense for two-thirds of its business, has lower margins than other UTC businesses.Hayes said a Sikorsky sale also is possible.Analysts have previously speculated thatTextron (TXT), which owns Bell Helicopter as well as Cessna Aircraft, is a possible buyer. So is aerospace giant Boeing (BA). Some have speculated that Boeing could exit combat aircraft if it doesn't win a major bomber contract.United Technologies also makes elevators (Otis), air conditioners and heating systems (Carrier) and jet engines (Pratt & Whitney).

While as much as 60% of Apple's revenue and 80% of its fiscal Q3 operating income growth came from China amid strong iPhone sales, Goldman Sachs economist David Kostin identified other stocks with the highest overall revenue exposure to China, in a research report published on Monday.Apple's iPhone sales in China might have topped the U.S. in fiscal Q3, but the companies with the most revenue exposure include Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (BRCM), Micron Technology (MU) and Avago Technologies (AVGO). Some of those stocks have sold off on Apple's weaker-than-expected iPhone sales in its fiscal Q3 ended June 27.Skyworks and Avago had been among the best-performing stocks in 2014 and early 2015, but they've fallen in the past couple of months.""Information technology stocks are the most exposed to China, with 10% of revenues generated in the region,"" said Kostin in the report. ""Sales to China account for less than 2% of revenues from the industrials and consumer sectors.""Industrial companies, however, have been harder hit by weak China economic data than consumer sectors, he wrote.Many companies have lowered guidance amid China's stock market turmoil, though the impact on its overall economy is still being debated by economists.""S&P 500 firms explicitly attribute just 2% of their revenues to China and 8% to the broader Asia-Pacific region,"" Kostin said. ""Analysts have slashed EPS estimates of U.S. firms with high sales exposure to China by 15% year-to-date vs. 8% for the overall S&P 500.""Bank of America/Merrill Lynch also weighed in on Monday, noting that ""China-exposed"" stocks have seen a lower proportion of June-quarter earnings beats and have given weaker guidance.

671,UTX,"Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 could be deemed ready for combat in the coming weeks, a major milestone for the $400 billion program after a series of development issues, as the Pentagon readies its largest order yet of the stealth fighter.The Marine Corps will carry out a final operational readiness inspection (ORI) in mid-July before declaring the first squadron of 10 F-35B fighter jets ready for initial combat use, said spokesman Maj. Paul Greenberg. The tests take about a week.""If the ORI is completed in July, and we are confident that the aircraft are ready for worldwide deployment, then we'll declare IOC (initial operational capability) in July,"" said Lt. Gen. Jon Davis, deputy commandant for Marine Corps aviation, in a statement to IBD.""If that doesn't happen until August, then it will be August. Bottom line is that we won't rush this; we are doing this the right way.""Once declared ready, the F-35's first deployment is slated for Iwakuni, Japan, in 2017. IOC for the Air Force's F-35 variant is expected in 2016, and the Navy's version is seen combat-ready between 2018 and 2019.The Pentagon plans to buy 2,443 F-35s to replace aging F-16s, A-10s, Boeing (BA) F/A-18s and AV-8Bs, though Marine Commandant Gen. Joseph Dunford, who has been tapped as the next Joint Chiefs chairman, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the F-35 buying plan is under review.International orders are expected to push the total number produced to over 3,100.The F-35 has come a long way — longer than expected — since Lockheed won the contract in October 2001. At that time, the first planes were expected to be available for military operations by 2010.The path to combat readiness has been turbulent, marked by delays, glitches and cost overruns. More recently, an issue with a United Technologies (UTX) Pratt & Whitney engine caused a fire last summer. The Pentagon has said the problem has been resolved.Last year, the Government Accountability Office found that the Autonomic Logistics Information System, which helps manage diagnostics, maintenance and supply-chain issues, failed to meet basic requirements like identifying faults and failures. And a 2013 Defense Department inspector general report found hundreds of flaws in the way the F-35 was being produced.But defense officials remain confident in the F-35's progress and plan to ask Congress for a ""block buy"" order for up to 500 planes that could top $40 billion vs. piecemeal orders like last year's $4.7 billion contract for 43 planes. The Pentagon is looking for a three-year order starting in fiscal 2018.The block buy ""will really be a mark that this aircraft has made it after going through its teething stages,"" said Andrew Hunter, director of the Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""The discussion over if the F-35 should have been done becomes more of a historical discussion and less of a policy discussion.""The massive bulk procurement is key to addressing the program's cost, which lawmakers are looking to slash by more than 10% with a block buy, according to Hunter.Under the most recent order, each plane without the engine costs $95 million to $116 million, depending on the variant. But a block buy could drive down costs to $80 million per plane, including the engine, according to Mark Bobbi, a military aircraft analyst at IHS.Lower costs as well as a strong performance by the Marine Corps' F-35B after being combat-approved could also help sway countries still on the fence about buying the F-35, Bobbi added. And additional foreign orders would further trim costs.So far, the F-35 seems to be hitting its marks ahead of IOC. In late June, the first live-bomb drops in a non-test environment were successful, with 14 pilots delivering 30 high explosives over a restricted area in southeastern California.""The weapons employment went extremely well and validated the simulated procedures pilots have been training to and gave us confidence in the jet's ability to perform with real weaponry as advertised,"" said Maj. Brendan Walsh, a pilot and operations officer, in a statement to IBD.In May, the plane also successfully completed 100 short takeoffs and 100 vertical landings aboard the USS Wasp, along with successful tests in both day and night conditions, according to Joe DellaVedova, a spokesman for the F-35 Joint Program Office.But as the F-35 nears combat readiness, skeptics of the program have doubted its ability to perform in actual combat.According to a report in the military blog War Is Boring, an older F-16, developed by Lockheed and General Dynamics (GD), outmaneuvered the F-35 in an air combat test in January. Analysts have also questioned the F-35's effectiveness at longer ranges.But the program office has said the test plane that was matched against the F-16 wasn't equipped with updates on F-35s currently in production, such as the latest software. It also noted the F-35 is designed to hit targets from long distances rather than engage in dogfights.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

Mechanical issues, along with costs, have dampened sales forecasts for the jet.In late June, a United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney engine caught fire during a takeoff at a Florida air base and the fleet was grounded July 3. Lockheed has resumed flights and said a fix is near.The company is reportedly close to a 43-plane, $4 billion deal with the U.S. Defense Department that should bring the cost of the eighth batch of planes down 2%-4%.Also, Pratt & Whitney said that the next two rounds of engines for the jet, the seventh and eighth batches, are expected to be 7%-8% cheaper than the prior one, on top of a 50% savings from earlier batches.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter at @IBD_GRich.

719,UTX,"Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-22 Raptor saw combat for the first time in Monday night's airstrikes against the Islamic State in Syria, a few years after the program was cut amid doubts about the pricey stealth jet's necessity. The F-22's advanced capabilities had been unnecessary in other attacks against insurgent groups, but they were needed to bypass Syria's air defense systems.…

721,UTX,"The first live-bomb drops for Lockheed Martin 's (LMT) F-35 Joint Strike Fighter in a nontest environment were successful as the Marine Corps gets ready to declare the jet combat ready.Fourteen pilots dropped 30 weapons last week over a restricted area in southeastern California, and all of the high-explosive weapons went off.""The weapons employment went extremely well and validated the simulated procedures pilots have been training to and gave us confidence in the jet's ability to perform with real weaponry as advertised. These were the first ordnance expenditures by a fleet squadron in a nontest environment,"" said Major Brendan Walsh, a pilot and operations officer, in an emailed statement to IBD.Lockheed shares rose 1.1% to 187.93 in the stock market today.The live-bomb drops come as the Marines are expected to declare the fighter operational in the coming weeks.In May, the F-35B version completed 100 short takeoffs and 100 vertical landings aboard the USS Wasp, said Joe DellaVedova, public affairs director for the F-35 Joint Program Office, in an earlier interview with IBD. The plane also successfully performed tests in both day and night conditions.The Marines will carry out a final operational readiness inspection (ORI) in mid-July before declaring the first squadron of 10 F-35B fighter jets ready for initial combat use, according to Maj. Paul Greenberg, a Marine public affairs officer. The tests take about a week.""If the ORI is completed in July, and we are confident that the aircraft are ready for worldwide deployment, then we'll declare IOC (initial operational capability, the point when an item first becomes usable) in July,"" said Lt. Gen. Jon Davis, Deputy Commandant for U.S. Marine Corps Aviation, in an emailed statement to IBD. ""If that doesn't happen until August, then it will be August. Bottom line is that we won't rush this; we are doing this the right way.""There have been some issues with the plane's development over the years. A problem with the United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney engine caused the plane to catch on fire last summer. The Pentagon has said that the problem has been resolved.The updated 3F version of the F-35's software will fix problems with the earlier software and give the plane full war-fighting capabilities in 2017, according to DellaVedova.However, issues with the plane may remain. According to a report in the military blog War Is Boring, an older General Dynamics (GD) F-16 outmaneuvered the expensive F-35 in an air combat test in January.But the Joint Program Office said that the report was misleading, that the F-35's technology is designed to work best at long range and not necessarily in dogfighting situations, and that the test plane wasn't equipped with updates on planes currently in production, such as the latest software that would allow the aircraft to use its next-generation sensors.Once declared ready, the plane's first deployment is slated for Iwakuni, Japan, in 2017, according to Greenberg.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

784,UTX,"Boeing (BA) was outpacing rival Airbus (EADSY) in new orders on Tuesday, day two of the Paris Air Show, the world's largest commercial aircraft expo.But European aerospace giant Airbus continued to announce new orders, bagging an estimated $16.4 billion as of early Tuesday vs. $29.6 billion for Boeing, according to Bloomberg.Korean Air inked a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to buy up to 50 A321neo aircraft, Airbus' new plane, which it offers with a choice of engines — either the new LEAP-X from CFM International, a 50-50 joint venture between General Electric's (GE) Aviation unit and Snecma of France, or one from United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney.Combined with airframe improvements, the A321neo delivers fuel savings of up to 15%, Airbus said.The carrier placed a firm order worth $3.7 billion at list price for 30 Airbus A321neo planes, its first purchase of single-aisle jets from Airbus, and took options on 20 more planes.Peach Aviation, a Japanese discount carrier, signed a contract with Airbus for three A320 narrow-body, wide-cabin jetliners, Peach's first direct order from Airbus. Osaka-based Peach serves domestic and international routes across Asia and operates 14 leased A320s.Among other orders, Taiwan's EVA Air signed an MOU with Airbus to purchase four more A330-300 wide-body twin engine jetliners. As with its existing fleet of 29 A330s, the new aircraft will be powered by CF6-80 engines from General Electric (GE) .Airbus also debuted a prototype helicopter, the X6, at the show, initiating a two-year development period for its next-generation heavy-lift rotorcraft. Airbus said that it will tailor the X6 for the commercial market, initially targeting oil and gas companies as well as search-and-rescue operations and VIP transportation.""It will set new standards in the industry not only for design but for its production strategy as well, as we will rely on the industrial capacities of our core countries, including the upcoming pillar in Poland,"" Airbus Helicopters CEO Guillaume Faury said in a press statement.On Monday, Airbus confirmed its earlier forecast for commercial jet sales to grow about 4% over the next 20 years to 32,585 planes, worth $4.9 trillion. It was a more conservative outlook than Boeing's view for the global commercial fleet of airplanes to double from 21,600 in 2014 to 43,560 by 2034.Airbus shares were down less than 1% in Tuesday afternoon trading in the stock market today. The aerospace giant's revenue has shrunk at an increasing pace over the past year in the face of a blitz of new product wins by Boeing. Airbus revenue over the past four quarters shrank 3%, 7%, 5% and a whopping 25% last quarter compared with the same quarter a year earlier.Boeing shares were roughly unchanged Tuesday afternoon.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar.
"
785,UTX,"United Technologies' (UTX) stock gapped down Monday after the aerospace giant said it would sell or spin off its Sikorsky Aircraft helicopter business and issued weaker full-year guidance.The company said it would likely determine whether to sell or spin off Sikorsky by the end of Q3. United Technologies said the move would better enable it ""to focus on providing high-technology systems and services to the aerospace and building industries."" A company that later became United Technologies bought Sikorsky in 1929.United's decision Monday follows Sikorsky's announcement this month that it would slash 1,400 jobs from its staff of more than 15,000. Sikorsky, best known as the manufacturer of Black Hawk helicopters, has faced a potentially tighter defense budget. Sinking oil prices have also brought cutbacks in the oil industry, constraining demand for helicopter transportation to oil facilities.In March, United Technologies said it was evaluating its options for Sikorsky ""to determine the best way to enhance its long-term success and create improved long-term value for UTC's customers and shareholders.""On Monday, United Technologies CEO Gregory Hayes in a statement said: ""Our strategic review has confirmed that exiting the helicopter business is the best path forward for United Technologies. Sikorsky is the world's premier helicopter company and through a series of strategic wins is well positioned for long-term growth. However, separation of Sikorsky from the portfolio will allow both United Technologies and Sikorsky to better focus on their core businesses.""United also makes aircraft engines, elevators, and flight and heating systems.The company also said Monday it sees 2015 earnings per share of $6.35 to $6.55, excluding Sikorsky, with revenue coming in at $58 billion to $59 billion.When including Sikorsky's results in its full-year projections, United Technologies forecast EPS of $6.55 to $6.85, down from an earlier outlook of $6.85 to $7.05.The company's news release did not offer sales projections that included Sikorsky's results.Analysts expect full-year EPS of $7 and sales of $65.1 billion.Shares dropped 2.3% to 114.88 in the stock market today, piercing their 50-day moving average and stopping just shy of reaching their 200-day line. The stock has consolidated over the past four months, spending much of that time below the 50-day line but finding support near the 200-day line.Prospective buyers of Sikorsky include Airbus (EADSY), Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT). Shares inched down for all three.

798,UTX,"Airbus (EADSY) edged out Boeing (BA) Thursday in the commercial orders race at the Paris Air Show, which saw stronger-than-expected demand for new passenger jets.The European aerospace giant received orders for a total of 421 aircraft, worth $57 billion at list prices. Boeing received orders and commitments for 331 planes valued at $50.2 billion. Buyers typically get undisclosed discounts for large orders.The combined tally of 752 eclipsed forecasts for a weak year as record backlogs and saturated growth markets were expected to weigh on demand. Before the show, Cowen analyst Cai von Rumohr predicted that Boeing and Airbus would have less than the average of 387 orders combined.Boeing shares closed up 1.4% on the stock market today. Airbus dipped 0.7%. Aerospace supplier United Technologies (UTX), which owns engine maker Pratt & Whitney, rose 0.7%. Honeywell (HON) gained 1.3%, and General Electric (GE) edged up 0.4%.This year's tally also topped last year's total of 687 at the Farnborough Airshow, which alternates with the Paris show each year. But Airbus' total was down from last year, when it received orders and commitments for 486 aircraft. Boeing's orders were up this year, as it had deals for just 201 planes at Farnborough.The 2015 number was also down from the 2013 Paris Air Show, which saw orders for 908 aircraft between the two aerospace giants. Blockbuster deals two years ago were led by new planes, including Airbus' A320neo and Boeing's 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner. Those planes have more fuel-efficient engines that were in demand at a time of high oil prices.But while the orders from the past week came in higher than expected, the Paris Air Show failed to impress some analysts.""There weren't any huge surprises there,"" said Robert Mann, president of aviation consultancy R.W. Mann & Co. ""I don't think anyone took home a trophy — unless in the Little League sense where everyone gets a trophy.""The Paris show's orders point to capacity increases in Asia, with China and Indonesia leading the way, he added. Garuda Indonesia, the country's flagship carrier, was among the big buyers at Paris, making deals to buy 30 Dreamliners and 30 737 Max jets from Boeing and 30 A350s from Airbus.Capacity should grow slightly in Eastern Europe, but Mann said most of the orders from the region will be for replacement planes.Major deals in prior shows came from Middle Eastern carriers, which kept a low profile this year as tensions with European and U.S. carriers heat up over capacity increases and competitive practices.Qatar Airway's A380 was featured at the show, but the airline didn't announce any big deals, like the 50-plane order it announced with Boeing at the 2014 Farnborough Airshow.No new planes from the two aircraft giants debuted at the show this year, though there was plenty of buzz over Boeing's acknowledgment that it's looking at a new mid-size plane and is already talking to potential customers about its requirements.Boeing was on track to finish the Paris show with the most orders, helped by a deal from aircraft lessor AerCap (AER) for 100 737 Max jets.But Wizz Air, a low-cost European carrier, made a provisional agreement at the last minute for 110 A321neos, worth $12.5 billion, putting Airbus in the lead. Airbus had forecast only 200 total orders and commitments at Paris.Both Boeing and Airbus must now manage bulging backlogs and plans to ramp up production rates. The companies have a combined backlog of 12,000 planes. Airbus is boosting output of its popular A320 airliner by nearly 20% to 50 per month in 2017. Boeing is lifting production of its 737 to 52 planes per month in 2018 vs. 42 currently.Supply chain issues may curb production growth. Last year, Air Lease (AL) COO John Plueger called the increase in Boeing and Airbus production a ""major concern"" and that suppliers are operating at ""absolute capacity."" GE has opened seven new engine parts plants in seven years to help keep up.Orders are expected to keep rolling in over the long term. Boeing sees demand for over 38,000 airplanes in the next two decades, with single-aisle planes the most sought after. Airbus sees demand for 32,600 new planes in the next 20 years.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

835,UTX,"Stocks lost their grip on most of the day's gains Thursday as the indexes headed into the final hour of trade. The Nasdaq was up 0.3%, after being up 1.5% at midday. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average held pops of 0.7% and 0.9%, respectively. Volume in the stock market today was running much slower than the previous session.Among widely held issues, AT&T (T) thrust about 2% higher in volume 55% above average. While the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are down about 10% and 8% respectively so far this year, AT&T has held steady with a 1% gain.AT&T's dividend might be part of the reason. In an ugly market, dividend stocks start looking good to some investors. AT&T has increased its dividend for 32 consecutive years. The current annualized yield is 5.6%.The stock price, though, has been rangebound for more than two years. AT&T stock has found repeated resistance at the 36-37 area and support at the 31-32 level. The stock is trading just under 35.In the IBD 50, a list of stocks with the best ratings via fundamentals and technicals, Carter's (CRI) gained 1% in volume a third faster than normal. The marketer of clothes for babies and children is working on a stage-two base. However, the stock needs to do more work on the right side. Carter's is 17% off its high.A stage-two base means the stock is forming its second consolidation since starting an advance. Breakouts from the first two consolidations are more likely to work than those from a later stage.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, coal and oil stocks grabbed the biggest gains. Funeral Services and book stocks took the hardest hits.Follow Paul Whitfield on Twitter @IBD_PWhitfield.

855,UTX,"Dividend stocks are known for providing steady income despite often-lackluster stock price performance.But Lockheed Martin (LMT) has broken the mold the past couple of years to give investors the best of both worlds. The stock, up 5.4% so far this year, rallied 30% last year, far outpacing the S&P 500's 3% and 11% gain this year and in 2014 respectively.It's now just out of buy range at 5% above a 193.04 flat-base entry initially cleared Dec. 19.The Bethesda, Md.-based defense contractor has been in the news with the upcoming launch of its much-anticipated F-35 fighter jet, which has come under fire for its high cost and spate of glitches.On Thursday, the Marine Corps Commandant expressed a high level of confidence that the F-35 will be ready for combat this year. The high-tech jet is expected to be ready for the Marine Corps in July, but requires 54 modifications to be completed before then.Last month Lockheed cut the price of the ninth batch of the F-35 by $1 million per plane, thanks to cost-saving manufacturing improvements and technology investments. Costs for its eighth batch have come down $260,000 per plane.In other news, on Friday the Pentagon said the U.S. Navy awarded Lockheed and United Technologies' (UTX) Sikorsky Helicopter joint venture a $2 billion contract to service the Navy's H-60 helicopter fleet through Jan. 31, 2020.Lockheed in January reported Q4 earnings of $2.82 a share, up 38% from last year but 3 cents below views. Revenue rose 8% to $12.5 billion, topping forecasts for $11.88 billion. It delivered 14 F-35 jets during the quarter.Annual profit rose 14% last year. Analysts expect a 2% dip this year and a 12% rise in 2016.Lockheed currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.50 a share, or $6 on an annualized basis, for a 3% yield.

"
857,UTX,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) has worked out some mechanical issues on the F-35 and racked up more orders, but there are still problems with the stealth jet that could weigh on quarterly earnings.The defense giant reports Tuesday, kicking off a busy week for aerospace companies and Pentagon contractors. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect a nearly 40% jump in Lockheed's fourth-quarter EPS to $2.85 per share. Sales are seen rising 3% to $11.9 billion.During the last quarter, the $400 billion F-35 program got a boost when the Pentagon ordered an eighth batch of fighter jets for $4 billion. The contract also includes additional cost savings. In October, the U.K. announced an agreement in principle to order four more F-35s, bringing the total order up to 14. Israel also has plans to buy more F-35s.United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney division said it would supply a seventh batch of F125 engines for the F-35, also with some cost savings.And more orders could come as production costs fall. Operational costs should also fall 15%, Rear Adm. Randy Mahr, the Pentagon's F-35 deputy program manager, told Reuters last year.But developmental problems persist. After an engine fire that temporarily grounded the F-35 fleet last summer, other issues continue to plague the program.Due to delays in software development, the F-35B model won't be able to fire its 25mm cannon by the Marine Corps' July target to declare the jet ready for combat use.Software issues don't stop with the gun. Michael Gilmore, the Pentagon's director of combat testing, told Congress recently there were ""serious deficiencies with hardware and software used to develop data files"" in the plane's computers. The files help identify enemy radar and ""are essential.""But the plane remains in demand around the world. And while the Pentagon and militaries abroad have scaled back budgets, the rise of the Islamic State, unrest in Syria and an aggressive Russia could mean more spending on high-tech weaponry like the F-35.General Dynamics (GD) is slated to announce Q4 results Wednesday. The defense contractor is seen posting a 21% rise in EPS to $2.13 but revenue is seen declining 0.8% to $8.04 billion.Northrup Grumman (NOC) is scheduled to announce results Thursday. The maker of the B-2 Spirit strategic bomber and the Global Hawk drone is expected to report a 6.1% increase in EPS to $2.25 but a 2.7% drop in revenue to $5.99 billion.Last week Northrop CEO Wes Bush said that he was happy with the government's approval of some drone exports but is still concerned that U.S. companies are losing market share over the ban on exporting large drones.Raytheon (RTN) is also slated to announce results Thursday. Analysts expect it to report a 23.3% jump in earnings per share and sales are seen rising 3.4% to $6.07 billion.The Aerospace/Defense group is ranked No. 59 out of the 197 industry groups IBD tracks, up from 104 eight weeks ago.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

885,UTX,"On Feb. 24, 1972, the Andraus Building in Sao Paulo caught fire.Some of the people trapped inside threw themselves out of the windows to escape the flames.Others rushed to the roof, where a swarm of Sikorsky helicopters plucked over 300 people from the burning building.Sixteen people died in the blaze, but the death toll could've been much higher.""I always believed that the helicopter would be an outstanding vehicle for the greatest variety of life-saving missions, and now, near the close of my life, I have the satisfaction of knowing that this proved to be true,"" Igor Sikorsky, the father of the helicopter, said in his last known letter, dictated Oct. 25, 1972, eight months after the chopper rescue and the day before he died.He could take pleasure in knowing he was a trailblazer in aviation, building large multiengine aircraft, transoceanic flying boats and — crucially — helicopters, after dreaming of a flying machine as a kid.Sikorsky was born in 1889 in Kiev, a city in present-day Ukraine that was part of Imperial Russia.He grew up in a household that valued learning, as his father was a psychology professor and his mother was a medical school graduate.""I was always interested in flying — I dreamed about it even when I was a small boy,"" Sikorsky said, according to documents found by the Sikorsky Archives in Stratford, Conn. ""However, at that time flying was considered completely impossible. The very expression of 'He was building a flying machine' was considered equivalent to saying that the man was crazy.""Doing What's WrightSikorsky began his studies at the Naval Academy in St. Petersburg.But after hearing about the Wright brothers' stunning, powered plane flight of 1903 in Kitty Hawk, N.C., Sikorsky was hooked on aviation. He made a beeline to Paris, studied aeronautics and took his knowledge back to Russia.Since childhood, Sikorsky had been fascinated with da Vinci's idea of a flying screwlike machine. Now he turned it into realitySikorsky built his first helicopter in 1909, but it couldn't lift itself.His model the next year achieved lift, but couldn't withstand the weight of a pilot.""He was ahead of his time; the technology just wasn't there,"" said Vinny Devine, who joined Sikorsky Archives after 26 years of managing publications and writing tech copy at Sikorsky Aircraft Corp., which is also in Stratford.So Sikorsky shelved his helicopter idea and turned his focus to fixed-wing aircraft. He proved good at it, building the world's first four-engine plane by 1913.""I will admit that a great deal of the design of these early aircraft were based on pure guesswork,"" Sikorsky said.During the Russian Revolution of 1917, with many of the people in his monarchist family and associates being executed by the Bolsheviks, Sikorsky fled to England, then France.By 1919 he was in America, with aeronautical plans renewed.""In America I found the confirmation of my hopes and came to understand the reason for the success of this country,"" he said. ""Nothing can equal free work of free men. This is the foundation upon which the indisputable success of the United States has been built.""The sky was truly the limit for Sikorsky. And he wasted hardly any time aiming high.He formed Sikorsky Aero Engineering Corp. in 1923 on Long Island. Three years later it built the S-35, a two-engine transport plane that was revamped with three engines for the first nonstop flight to Paris. This came amid an effort to win the Orteig Prize, which would go to whomever made the first trans-Atlantic flight.But the S-35 was overloaded and crashed and burned during takeoff. One of the mechanics, a Sikorsky friend, was on the plane and died.The tragedy didn't deter Sikorsky. He immediately went back to building a replacement jet, but Charles Lindbergh beat him to Paris and to the prize when his single-engine Spirit of St. Louis landed in Paris on May 21, 1927.With aviation in its infancy during those days of the early 20th century, injury and death threatened pilots and crew each time they took flight. Sikorsky, who also piloted his planes, handled the danger through his faith in God, even writing two books on religion: ""The Message of the Lord's Prayer"" and ""The Invisible Encounter.""He said: ""In improving the situation, science and human intellect are capable of performing miraculous work, provided only that they are guided and directed by the intellect of the higher order — spiritual wisdom. Without such guidance, science and intellect are absolutely blind and completely unreliable.""Losing out to Lindbergh for the Orteig Prize wasn't going to deter Sikorsky, whose planes were on the rise. He had already built the S-29-A twin-engine plane in 1924.Then in 1928 he completed the S-38, which could also land on water and was used by Pan Am in Central and South America.Still, his company struggled financially. ""He was an inventor and genius and wasn't great on the financial side of things,"" Devine said. ""Business wasn't his strong suit.""Playing To His StrengthsIn 1925, the company name changed to Sikorsky Manufacturing Co. and transferred administrative duties to Massachusetts businessman Arnold Dickinson, who invested $100,000. This let Sikorsky focus on building planes rather than running the business.Four years later, the firm became part of United Aircraft & Transport, now called United Technologies (UTX), and moved to Connecticut.United Tech has since soared, reaching today's market cap of $108 billion and annual sales of $65 billion while seeing its stock triple since 2009. The conglomerate also owns Pratt & Whitney, which designs jet engines, and Otis Elevator.While Sikorsky became a U.S. citizen, he remembered his Russian roots. He was loyal to fellow immigrants who helped found Sikorsky Aero Engineering, and when United Tech implemented budget cuts, he made sure his employees were spared, according to Devine.Aviation was improving rapidly in the 1930s, flying farther with more passengers, and finally, in 1939, Sikorsky returned to his dream of building a helicopter.""The helicopter approaches closer than any other (vehicle) to fulfillment of mankind's ancient dream of the flying horse and the magic carpet,"" he said.Sikorsky changed the design of the VS-300 helicopter each day. The first tethered flight came in September 1939, with the first try without a lifeline eight months later. Finally, in May 1941, he hit on a configuration that worked well enough to produce. No one had ever flown a helicopter, and Sikorsky was his own test pilot.His perseverance was crucial in getting the helicopter off the ground, said Devine: ""He had an inventive mind, and if something didn't work he would think of another worth trying. Eventually he would get to something that worked.""All the while, Sikorsky noted that he wasn't alone in achieving his dream: ""The whole art of aeronautics, all of man's accumulated experience in mechanical flight, has contributed to the development of direct-lift operation.""In 1943, the R-4 rolled out of the United Aircraft & Transport factory in Stratford, Conn., and became the first helicopter for the military. By April 1944, it was in the thick of World War II, hovering into a combat rescue mission in Burma.Sikorsky continued to improve his designs, creating an amphibious helicopter that could take off and land in the water and a helicopter that could carry a jeep.He kept an engineering notebook by his bedside and was on the job 24 hours a day. Even after he retired in 1957, he went to the office until the day he died, Devine says.Sikorsky lived until age 83, and his legacy lives on at United Tech. The company kept the Sikorsky name for the helicopter unit after buying his company. ""Sikorsky is unique in that our founder's innovative spirit, persistence and humility continue to inspire everyone who works at the company today, more than 90 years since its founding,"" said Mark Miller, vice president of research and engineering at Sikorsky Aircraft. ""He created a mindset that continues to drive the company today — rethink, challenge and overcome what the world considers impossible.""Today, the U.S. military accounts for half of Sikorsky helicopter sales. Civilian medical and search and rescue teams also use the old Russian's helicopters to save lives around the world.

886,UTX,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) is expected to see orders for its F-35 stealth fighter rise in the proposed fiscal 2016 Pentagon budget, which also requests money to develop a follow-on fighter jet.The official budget request won't be released until Monday, but Politico reported the Defense Department will ask for $585 billion, $35 million above the limit set by sequestration, requiring Congress to lift its spending limits.The budget would include a $10.6 billion request for 57 F-35 fighter jets, up from the 38 F-35s approved for fiscal 2015.Lockheed shares rose 1.5% to 193.33 in the stock market today. On Tuesday, the defense giant report Q4 earnings that missed views, though the F-35 program helped revenue top estimates.The F-35 hasn't entered combat service — that is supposed to happen later this year — but defense officials are reportedly starting to plan for new planes.Pentagon acquisition chief Frank Kendall says the 2016 request will include funds to begin development of separate jets for the Air Force and Navy with a more high-tech engine, according to the Wall Street Journal.Lockheed along with Boeing (BA) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) are the likely contenders for the airframe contract, with General Electric (GE) and United Tech's (UTX) Pratt & Whitney seen vying for the engine work. Pratt & Whitney currently makes the engines for the F-35.Development of a next-generation fighter jet would come amid cost overruns, schedule delays and technical glitches for the F-35. Meanwhile, China allegedly has used stolen F-35 plans to help create its own stealth fighter, the J-31.The Defense Department will also seek $1.2 billion for the development of a new long-range bomber — another contract that's expected to be hotly contested — as well as $821 million procurement of MQ-9 Reaper drones, according to Politico.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

899,UTX,"Pumped up by a strengthening U.S. and collapsing crude oil prices and weaker economies overseas, the dollar is flexing its muscles, resulting in weaker earnings and guidance for companies with international exposure.
"
900,UTX,"Procter & Gamble (PG) said Tuesday its outlook for the entire year will be clouded by foreign exchange, which the company expects to reduce annual sales by 5% and net earnings by 12%.The Cincinnati-based consumer goods giant gets two-thirds of its revenue from outside America. When the dollar is strong, U.S. exports are more expensive and overseas sales translate into fewer greenbacks. P&G shares fell 3.4% Tuesday.Pfizer (PFE) in part blamed the stronger dollar for its sullen 2015 forecast. The largest U.S. drugmaker expects full-year adjusted earnings of $2 to $2.10, or 5% less than analysts thought. It sees sales of about $45.5 billion, slightly less than Wall Street views. Its shares fell 0.6% Tuesday, less than the general market.Other drug companies also are absorbing forex hits. Basel-based Novartis (NVS) is wrestling with a strong dollar and a Swiss franc that shot up this month after its currency cap was lifted.Buoyed by increasing consumer confidence and lower gasoline prices, the U.S. economy has been outperforming the rest of the world as Europe copes with deflation, Japan and Brazil endure recessions, China grows at a slower clip and Russia's petro-economy faces cheap oil and Western sanctions over Ukraine.As a result, the dollar rose 5% vs. major trading partners in Q4, the biggest gain since Q4 2008, when the global financial crisis spurred a brief stampede into dollar-denominated assets. As of Jan. 23, that dollar index in 2015 was a whopping 10% higher than Q4's average, turbocharged by central bank easings around the world.The ruble has lost half its value against the dollar in the past year. The yen lost about 15%, the euro 18.5% and the British pound 11.7%. The Chinese yuan, loosely pegged to the dollar, flattened last year after gaining strength slowly in recent years.Some analysts see cause for optimism, especially given oil prices' dramatic fall.""There is a question of (cheaper) energy being a windfall ... for consumers worldwide and with a weakening eurozone currency, does that bode well for S&P (500) profits?"" said Robert Keiser, vice president at S&P Capital IQ. ""In theory, yes. In theory, the global macroeconomic outlook is improving.""But in reality, his theory hasn't caught up yet to many U.S. companies reliant on overseas sales.The dollar will be ""a substantial headwind for us in 2015,"" DuPont (DD) CFO Nick Fanandakis said in a Tuesday conference call. He figures that forex will take 60 cents, or 12.7%, off his profit estimate to about $4.10 per share this year. Analysts expected $4.46. Shares fell 1.3%.Like Pfizer and Novartis, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) expects foreign exchange rates to cut 2015 revenue by $800 million and EPS by 12-14 cents. Bristol guided full-year sales to $14 billion to $15 billion and EPS to $1.55 to $1.70. Shares fell 0.8% Tuesday.It's hard to measure the dollar's impact on the overall S&P 500 — whose large-cap companies tend to have heavy overseas exposure — because the handling and accounting of foreign revenue vary from firm to firm.It's easier to analyze the effect of collapsing oil prices on corporate America: Q4 S&P 500 earnings are on track to rise 3.3%, but would be up nearly 7% excluding the energy sector, said Gregory Harrison, a senior analyst at Thomson Reuters.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect it to post EPS of $1.27. That's down from $1.39 the prior year and would mark United Technologies' first earnings decline since the fourth quarter of 2012.Revenue is seen rising 2% to $14.7 billion.In a note, analysts at Trefis said that restructuring costs will ""more than offset moderate sales growth. However, we figure margin-expansion gains driven by these restructuring activities will benefit United Technologies over the long term.""Those restructuring costs are tied to efforts intended to reduce long-term operating expenses such as headcount reductions and plant consolidations.United Technologies' sales growth likely will be driven by higher demand for aircraft engines and other components from Boeing (BA) and Airbus, which should lead to a rise in shipments of UTC's aircraft components.Meanwhile, United Technologies' military segment has been hurt by a reduction in U.S. military spending due to the gradual pullout from the war in Afghanistan as well as fiscal constraints.""We figure the weakness in United Technologies' military markets will temper its growth from commercial aviation in the first quarter,"" Trefis noted.For the full year, analysts expect the company's sales to grow 4% and earnings to rise 10%.Last year United Technologies logged a 9% gain in revenue, thanks partly to a full year of sales from its B.F. Goodrich unit, which United Technologies acquired in 2012.Earnings in 2013 rose to $6.83 a share from $6.21 a year earlier.""The company's organic sales also picked up steadily through 2013 on higher demand from commercial aviation, partially offset by lower military spending in the U.S.,"" Trefis said.During the 2013 fourth quarter, United Technologies reported a 52% EPS gain to $1.58, topping views by a nickel.

Overall sales were flat — actually ending a five-quarter decline.But China sales rose 30% vs. a year earlier. CEO Doug Oberhelman credits increased dealer deliveries and the favorable impact of dealer inventory changes.Economic growth in China of around 7.5% this year ""should support improvements in the machine industry and increase commodity demand.""Yum! Brands (YUM), parent of the KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut restaurant chains, says that its China-division sales grew 17% year over year, with restaurant margins increasingly almost 7% and operating profit up 80%. Yum adds that it expects to open at least 700 restaurants in China this year.The company is seeing improvement from a year earlier, when a chicken health scare scared jittery diners and investors. CEO David Novak cited KFC in China as ""the most significant driver"" of Yum's strong bounce back in the first quarter.Global casino giant Las Vegas Sands (LVS) topped Q1 forecasts Thursday, with strong growth in earnings and revenue driven in part by Sands Macau, its majority-owned unit in China's gaming mecca. Sands Macau revenue climbed 35%, and net income rose 66%.

1012,UTX,"At present, the U.S. equity market is jittery over the possible outcome of the U.S-China trade war. The turmoil had begun when the world’s largest economy imposed import tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium. Now, with many other goods/items included in the tariff bracket, affected foreign nations like Mexico, Canada, China and European Union are considering undertaking similar retaliatory measures.The import tariff imposition, though aims at protecting the interest of U.S. domestic industries, have side effects. For instance, the tariff on import of steel and aluminium has resulted in many industries facing higher raw material costs and shrinking corporate margins. However, the move has been beneficial for the U.S. steel makers. Likewise, though any restriction on China’s investment in the U.S. telecom sector will benefit the U.S. telecom equipment manufacturers, it will hurt those that rely on Chinese imports.Amid all the trade tensions, we believe that the U.S. economy still holds strong growth potential and some of its policy changes in the recent past have been wholeheartedly welcomed by the market. The most impressive was the implementation of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act in December 2017. This measure has helped in improving liquidity of the corporates, enabling them to make additional investment in growth projects.On a broader aspect, accelerating growth of the global economy — from 3.2% in 2016 to 3.8% in 2017 and 3.9% projected for 2018 by the International Monetary Fund — will help in propelling the economy. This premier institution expects the economy to advance 2.9% in 2018, reflecting hike of 0.2% from its earlier forecasts.Currently, the equity market offers many investment-friendly options. However, choosing the right sector and companies might be a daunting task.At this juncture, our classifications of the country’s stocks under 16 broad sectors and ranking of each of these can be of help. Each sector’s rank is calculated on the basis of the average of Zacks Rank of all the companies within it. The Zacks Sector Rank of 1 is placed at the top, with the first eight sectors placed in the top half and the other eight in the bottom half. Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than two. (To learn more visit: About Zacks Sector Rank)Investors interested in gaining exposure in the U.S. equity universe can focus on stocks that belong to the top-ranked Zacks Conglomerates sector.Top-Ranked Conglomerates SectorConglomerates currently occupy the first position in the Zacks sectors list. It is at the top position of the Zacks Sector heatmap for the second consecutive week. A brief on the sector’s past performance and growth projections is provided below.In the past five years, the sector has yielded 17.3% return.Prospects are bright in the years ahead, with these multi-sector companies collectively anticipated to record year-over-year earnings growth of 1.4% in 2018 on revenue expansion of 4.6%. Earnings and sales growth are forecasted higher than 9.3% fall and 2% gain recorded in 2017. Also, the sector’s earnings are projected to grow 8.7% in 2019 while the same will likely expand 6.7% in the next three to five years.The growing need for technologically-advanced equipments in every stage of manufacturing across multiple industries will keep demand strong for many of the multi-sector companies. Also, strengthening industrial production of the country — evident from 2.8% year-over-year growth registered in January 2018 to 3.5% growth in May 2018 — and an improving housing market help in building favorable operating conditions. Furthermore, year-over-year growth of 7% in shipments and 9.9% in orders of U.S.-manufactured durable goods for the five-months ended May 2018 boost prospects of the conglomerates.4 Suitable Investment Picks in the SectorUsing Zacks Stock Screener, we have zeroed in on four lucrative investment options from the Conglomerates sector that stand tall despite all the near-term uncertainties.Hitachi Ltd.

1013,UTX,"United Technologies Corporation’s (UTX  -  Free Report) operating segment — Climate, Controls & Security — recently entered into a definitive agreement with The Middleby Corporation (MIDD  -  Free Report). Per the deal, this segment will sell Taylor Company to Middleby — a manufacturer of commercial foodservice equipment. This $1 billion deal is expected to close early in the third quarter of 2018.Our TakeUnited Technologies serves various end-markets such as aerospace, defense and commercial construction. This business mix and diversification allows the company to generate profit even during tough economic times by delivering consistent earnings and dividend growth. Also, the company’s continuous investment in innovative products, through higher engineering expenditures, secures orders that might drive the top line in future.In the past six months, shares of United Technologies have gained 7.2% against the industry’s decline of 6.2%.  Moreover, the company’s strong aftermarket services business remains relatively stable compared to new product delivery. This, in turn, helps United Technologies to offset the impact of downturns in the new products market. For instance, in first-quarter 2018, its aftermarket business witnessed robust sales across the segments with commercial and military up 18% and 13%, respectively.Meanwhile, the company also revamped its aerospace unit, including an overhaul of its organizational structure. Per United Technologies, its streamlined organizational set-up might enable the company to better serve its customers.However, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company relies on suppliers, including third-party contract manufacturing and commodity markets, to secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems. Therefore, any disruption in deliveries from suppliers, capacity constraints, production disruptions, price changes, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities may adversely impact United Technologies’ ability to meet delivery schedules and increase operating costs.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) and Danaher Corporation (DHR  -  Free Report). Both these companies carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Honeywell surpassed estimates in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 1.5%.Danaher exceeded estimates in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 4.1%.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.     Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1014,UTX,"The Middleby Corporation (MIDD  -  Free Report) has been trying to strengthen its business on the back of numerous acquisitions, but the ongoing brand consolidation and restructuring moves have been depressing the company’s revenues and profitability.Acquisition Story  Middleby recently announced that it has inked a definitive agreement to acquire Taylor Company from UTC Climate, Controls & Security — a business division of United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report). The company noted that this $1-billion buyout deal will aid in strengthening its position in the global commercial foodservice industry, going forward.Taylor Company provides state-of-the-art ice cream and soft-serve dispensing equipment, frozen drink machines, beverage solutions and automated double-sided grills in the market. The company generated roughly $315 million revenues and $65 million adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation in 2017.Middleby stated that the Taylor buyout will strengthen its presence among foodservice and chain restaurant customers, moving ahead. This transaction is anticipated to bring out roughly $16 million cash tax benefits annually and be accretive to the company’s earnings per share within the first 12 months of the deal’s closure. Moreover, Middleby targets to secure $15-million synergies from the acquisition.The company will finance this all-cash deal with its existing revolving credit facility and expects to close it by early third quarter. The agreement is currently subject to regulatory approvals.Middleby is currently following an acquisition-based growth strategy. In the first quarter, acquisition-related benefits drove the company's sales by $63.9 million. The acquisitions of Sveba Dahlen, QualServ, L2F and Globe (all closed in 2017) are expected to drive revenues of the company's Commercial Foodservice Equipment Group. Also, the Burford, CVP Systems, and Scanico buyouts (all closed in 2017) will likely bolster revenues of its Food Processing Equipment Group. Notably, buyouts made this year, like Josper S.A and Firex Srl, will likely drive the company's top-line results in the quarters ahead.Existing ConcernsOver the past month, Middleby’s shares have lost 18%, underperforming 2.7% growth recorded by the industry. Eliminating the impact of Accounting Standards Codification 606, favorable foreign exchange and acquisitions, revenues of this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company fell 7.2% year over year in the first quarter. Sluggish market conditions in the U.K. might continue to dent sales of the company’s AGA Rangemaster business, going forward. Moreover, consolidation of premium brands (like Lynx and LaCornue) and ongoing restructuring moves might dampen revenues in the upcoming quarters. In addition, the company believes delay in few large projects will dent its Food Processing Equipment segment’s top line, in the near term. Reduced sales volume in the near-term quarters might continue to weigh over the company’s margins in the quarters ahead.Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s earnings in 2018 moved 6.6% south to $6.06 for 2018 and $6.61 in 2019. Moreover, per our estimates, the company’s earnings are expected to edge down 1.6% year over year in 2018.Stocks to ConsiderTwo better-ranked stocks in the industry are listed below:Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc.

(RAVN  -  Free Report).In the last six months, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has yielded a return of 13.8% against the industry’s decline of 11%.Existing ScenarioRaven’s Aerostar segment continues to witness growth across many of its platforms, including stratospheric balloons, radar systems, and aerostats. For instance, in first-quarter fiscal 2019, sales at the segment recorded an increase of 13.5% year over year driven by growth across core product lines. Over the past few quarters, the pipeline of high-quality business opportunities for the division has improved significantly.Moreover, the company has been successful in building the market for its stratospheric technology. Also, its considerable advancements in balloon duration consistently supported the progress on Google's Project Loon and NASA's mission. Currently, Raven’s pipeline is much stronger and a positive leading indicator for meaningful new sales in fiscal 2019. Also, it remains optimistic about surpassing prior-year quarter’s sales and adjusted operating income in fiscal 2019.Furthermore, Raven’s commitment toward introduction of new products is encouarging. This, in turn, enables the company to gain traction, particularly through original equipment manufacturer (OEM) channel. Also, over the past few quarters, the company has successfully developed its next-generation rate control technology.This apart, the company’s investment in additional manufacturing capacity, and research and technology development activities is likely to augment core product lines.

1017,UTX,"The Middleby Corporation (MIDD  -  Free Report) yesterday announced that it has successfully completed $1-billion buyout of Taylor Company from UTC Climate, Controls & Security — the business division of United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report). The buyout, originally announced on May 18, will fortify Middleby’s position in the global commercial foodservice industry.Taylor provides state-of-the-art ice cream and soft-serve dispensing equipment, frozen drink machines, beverage solutions and automated double-sided grills. It generated roughly $315 million revenues and $65 million adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation in 2017. Details of BuyoutMiddleby financed the all-cash deal with its existing revolving credit facility. It anticipates that Taylor’s addition to its portfolio is likely to strengthen its existing product offerings — including automated cooking solutions — as well as enhance its overall technological expertise.Furthermore, Middleby anticipates this buyout to yield annual cash tax benefit of $16 million (the net present value of which is $150 million) as well as prove accretive to earnings per share within the first 12 months from the completion of the deal. Moreover, the company targets securing synergies of at least $15 million from the acquisition.The acquired assets will be integrated with Middleby’s Commercial Foodservice Equipment Group. This segment accounted for roughly 61.5% of the company’s total revenues in first-quarter 2018. Types of equipment in this segment, primarily cooking equipment for restaurants and institutional kitchens, are sold under brands like Combi, Lang, MPC, PrefectFry, CookTek, Southbend and Wells. Snapshot of Middleby’s Inorganic InitiativesWe believe that the above-mentioned transaction is consistent with Middleby’s policy of acquiring meaningful businesses to gain access to new customers, regions and product lines.Prior to this buyout, the company acquired Washington-based Hinds-Bock Corporation in February 2018. This acquisition has been strengthening its existing businesses in food processing and industrial baking markets. In March 2018, the company added Italy-based Ve.Ma.C. to its portfolio, thereby enhancing its product offerings in the food processing market. In April 2018, it acquired Firex Srl, JoeTap and Josper S.A. While Firex Srl and JoeTap are anticipated to boost the company’s commercial foodservice business, Josper S.A. buyout is likely to add value to residential and commercial foodservice businesses.In the first quarter of 2018, Middleby’s acquired assets generated revenues of approximately $63.9 million. Zacks Rank & Key PicksDespite efforts on improving its business portfolio via meaningful acquisitions, ongoing brand consolidation and restructuring moves have been depressing Middleby’s revenues and profitability. These aspects, as well as adversaries from the delay in large projects in the Food Processing Equipment segment, might be concerning.

GAAP earnings from continuing operations for the reported quarter were $397 million or 50 cents per share compared with $1,013 million or $1.25 per share in the year-earlier quarter. Excluding restructuring and other non-recurring items, adjusted earnings for the reported quarter were $1.60 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.56. The company reported adjusted earnings of $6.65 for the year ended Dec 31, 2017.

Quarterly sales exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15,400 million. The top-line increase was primarily attributable to organic growth of 5% — the highest since 2014. Growth in revenues across all segments of the company helped drive total revenues. An increase in demand for the company’s products by the commercial aviation industry and an increase in spending by the U.S. defense industry have helped augment revenues for the company. The strong aftermarket business, which sells spare parts and offers related services to keep the primary products running, has also benefited results.For 2017, the company reported total revenues of $59,837 million compared with $57,244 million in the previous year.Segmental DetailsNet sales of Otis were $3,250 million compared with $3,063 million in the prior-year quarter showing an organic growth of 3% for the quarter.Aggregate quarterly revenues from UTC Climate, Controls & Security came in at $4,520 million compared with $4,249 million in the year-ago quarter, with an organic growth of 3%.Pratt & Whitney revenues were $4,461 million, up from $3,992 million in the year-ago quarter, with an organic growth of 11%.UTC Aerospace Systems sales came in at $3,803 million, up from $3,598 million in the year-earlier quarter, showing an organic growth of 5% for the quarter.Costs and MarginsOperating profit for the reported quarter was $1,952 million compared with $1,639 million in the year-ago period despite rise in operating expenses owing to significant top-line growth.  Operating income for Otis decreased 8.9% year over year to $470 million with margin contraction of 230 basis points making operating margin 14.5%.

Adjusted earnings are currently anticipated to lie within the $6.85-$7.10 per share range. Additionally, the company has given revenue guidance for 2018 between $62.5-$64 billion (estimating organic growth of 4-6% year over year).United Technologies’ acquisition of Rockwell Collins, an Iowa-based avionics firm has helped create this bullish outlook. The acquisition, slated to be completed by the third quarter of 2018, will provide a huge competitive advantage for the company and increase its bargaining power. The resultant operating synergies and lower operating costs will help it create complementary products that will help it serve evolving global customer needs.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision lower for the current quarter. While looking back an additional 30 days, we can see even more upward momentum. There have been only two moves up in the last two months.United Technologies Corporation Price and Consensus  United Technologies Corporation Price and Consensus | United Technologies Corporation Quote VGM ScoresAt this time, UTX has an average Growth Score of C, however its momentum is doing a bit better with a B.

1026,UTX,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 4.7% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is UTX due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.United Technologies Lifts '18 View on Solid Q1 EarningsUnited Technologies reported robust first-quarter 2018 results, driven by significant organic growth and diligent operational execution. The company reported adjusted earnings of $1.77 per share, which trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.51 and rose 19.6% year over year.Net sales in the reported quarter came in at $15,242 million, up 10.3% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. Quarterly sales exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14,537 million. The top-line increase was driven by organic growth of 6% — the highest first-quarter growth since 2011.Buoyed by the impressive performance, the company raised its earnings and sales guidance for 2018.The company’s top line was driven by growth in all the segments. An increase in demand for the company’s products by the commercial aviation industry and an increase in spending by the U.S. defense industry have augmented revenues for the company. The strong aftermarket business, which sells spare parts and offers related services to keep the primary products running, drove results.Segmental DetailsNet sales of Otis were $3,037 million, up 8.3% compared with $2,804 million in the prior-year quarter and showing an organic growth of 1% for the quarter.Aggregate quarterly revenues from UTC Climate, Controls & Security came in at $4,376 million, up 12.4% compared with $3,892 million in the year-ago quarter, with an organic growth of 7%.Pratt & Whitney revenues were $4,329 million, up 15.2% from $3,758 million in the year-ago quarter, with an organic growth of 9%.UTC Aerospace Systems sales came in at $3,817 million, up 5.7% from $3,611 million in the year-earlier quarter, showing an organic growth of 6% for the quarter.Operating Profits & MarginsOperating profit was $1,982 million compared with $2,144 million in the year-ago quarter, owing to steep rise in operating expenses despite significant top-line growth. However, when adjusted for non-recurring and non-operational expenses, consolidated segment operating profit for the quarter actually rose 11.6% to $2,027 million.Operating income for Otis inched up 0.7% year over year to $450 million as operating margin contracted 110 basis points (bps) to 14.8%. Operating income of UTC Climate, Controls & Security plunged 36.4% year over year to $592 million with steep margin contraction of 1040 bps to 13.5%.Operating profit of Pratt & Whitney increased 16% year over year to $413 million with margins staying constant year over year at 9.5%.

Backed by these positives, the company raised its full-year 2018 earnings and sales guidance. The company now expects adjusted earnings between $6.95 and $7.15, up from the previous range of $6.85-$7.10. Additionally, the company raised revenue guidance for 2018 from earlier range of $62.5-$64 billion to a band of $63-$64.5 billion.United Technologies’ acquisition of Rockwell Collins, an Iowa-based avionics firm has contributed to the bullish outlook. The acquisition, slated to be completed by the third quarter of 2018, will provide a huge competitive advantage for the company and increase its bargaining power. The resultant operating synergies and lower operating costs will help it create complementary products that will help it serve evolving global customer needs.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to four lower.United Technologies Corporation Price and Consensus United Technologies Corporation Price and Consensus | United Technologies Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, UTX has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum is doing a lot better with a B.

1028,UTX,"Around 87 S&P 500 companies have reported first-quarter 2018 results as of Apr 20, reflecting a continuation of the strong momentum seen in the preceding earnings season. Total earnings for these companies are up 25% year over year on 10.7% higher revenues, with 82.8% beating earnings estimates and 67.8% surpassing top-line expectations. Based on the hitherto observed pattern, the first quarter of 2018 is anticipated to register robust growth in earnings and revenues.Per our latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to rise 18.3% on 7.7% revenue growth. This represents better growth projections compared with the previous quarter — courtesy of a corporate tax overhaul and relatively healthy job data. Experts believe that earnings growth is likely to improve steadily in 2018 and beyond.Notably, earnings growth is expected to be in double-digits on a year-over-year basis for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors. Only two sectors (Autos & Conglomerates) are expected to show earnings declines in the to-be-reported quarter.For the Conglomerates sector, earnings are expected to decline 9.4% year over year while sales are anticipated to rise 2.6% (as on Apr 18). Meanwhile, ongoing Ongoing tariff issues, which are likely to impact major U.S. industrials, are weighing on the companies margins in the sector.Let’s take a sneak peek at two major Conglomerate stocks scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings tomorrow and see how things are shaping up for the upcoming results. 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report results before the opening bell. The company is likely to report higher industrial segment profit in the quarter backed by strong automotive and aerospace solutions, industrial adhesives and tapes abrasives as well as its automotive aftermarket businesses. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues from 3M’s Industrial segment is pegged at $2,866 million, higher than $2,718 million in the previous quarter. However, of late, the company is facing steep pension expenses and remains susceptible to commodity price risks. Additionally, it remains concerned about adverse currency translations, which may be a drag on its profitability. (Read more: What's in the Offing for 3M Company in Q1 Earnings?) For the first quarter, the company’s earnings are expected to improve 15.7% year over year on 5.1% higher revenues. 3M has an Earnings ESP of +0.40% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which makes an earnings surprise prediction difficult. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat estimates.

In the impending quarter, the company’s earnings are expected to rise 2% year over year on 5.2% higher revenues. However, United Technologies’ financial performance depends on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries. Also, it strongly relies on suppliers, including third-party contract manufacturing and commodity markets, to secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems, and that that exposes the company to market price volatility and availability risks. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its UTC Aerospace Systems segment’s revenues is pegged at $3,642 million, significantly down from $3,803 million in the prior quarter. Further, Pratt & Whitney segment’s revenues are likely to come in at $4,280 million compared with $4,461 million in the previous quarter.Our proven model does not show that United Technologies is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is -0.75%, with the former pegged at $1.50 and the latter at $1.51. Moreover, United Technologies has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

1030,UTX,"Pratt & Whitney, one of the operating segments of United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), announced that JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) will power another 45 Airbus A320neo family aircrafts with its Geared Turbofan (GTF) engines.This follows a previous order of 40 GTF-powered A320neo family aircraft. This indicates that JetBlue has committed to 85 GTF-powered aircraft, which includes both A320neo and A321neo models. Pratt & Whitney will deliver engine maintenance through a 15-year EngineWise service agreement.JetBlue believes the engines will optimize aircraft performance and efficiency, while reducing cost and minimizing carbon footprint. Since early 2016, the GTF engine has consistently exhibited its ability to lower fuel burn by 16%, shrink nitrogen oxide emissions by 50% to the regulatory standard and diminish noise footprint by 75%.Industry observers widely expected the Pratt & Whitney engine business to be the profit driver for its parent firm, United Technologies. However, till date, the engines have failed to live up to expectations as the business continues to dent overall earnings. Nevertheless, United Technologies outperformed the industry with a gain of 7.6% in the last six months, against a decline of 11.3% for the latter. In February, problems emerged with the Pratt & Whitney engines on its best-selling A320neo planes, which led to multiple instances of in-flight engine shutdown. Following this, Airbus stopped all deliveries of its Pratt & Whitney-powered A320neo aircraft. In response to this, European regulators and the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) issued formal warnings of the risk of shutdown due to Pratt & Whitney’s engines.Later, Pratt & Whitney stated that it resolved the issue which affected the GTF engines. The problem is the latest in a string of setbacks for Pratt & Whitney’s GTF engines. The engine has been plagued by durability issues and delivery delays since a long time.However, JetBlue’s recent order reaffirmed its faith in Pratt & Whitney’s troubled jet engines. Conquering the engine issues continues to be critical for the company, which is leaning heavily on the GTF engines to fight General Electric in the market to power narrow-body planes. Interestingly, United Technologies invested a whopping $10 billion to develop the quieter and more fuel-efficient engine.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderUnited Technologies has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the same space include Federal Signal Corporation (FSS  -  Free Report) and Leucadia National Corporation , both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Federal Signal has trumped estimates in each of the trailing four quarters and generated an average beat of 16.5%.Leucadia National has beaten estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, the average earnings surprise being 6.6%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?

1031,UTX,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business segment recently won a contract for offering Block 4.1 common capabilities pre-modernization efforts to support the preliminary design review of F-35 Lightning II jets. The deal will cater to the U.S. Air Force and the nation’s overseas partners.Details of the DealValued at $211.3 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland. Work related to this deal will be carried out in Fort Worth, TX.Fiscal 2018 research, development, test and evaluation (Air Force); and international partnership funds will be utilized to partially finance the task. The project is expected to be completed by July 2019.F-35 AttributesLockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is a single-seat, single-engine 5th Generation fighter aircraft that comes with an advanced stealth feature combined with enhanced fighter speed and agility, fully fused sensor information, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment. In fact, three variants of F-35 are set to replace five fighter jets for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps as well as a variety of fighter jets for at least 10 other countries.With Lockheed Martin being the primary partner, the F-35 program has been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors. While, Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) rendered its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology to this program, BAE Systems’ (BAESY  -  Free Report) short takeoff and vertical landing experience as well as air systems sustainment supported the jet’s combat capabilities. Moreover, Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report), provided F-35s with the F135 propulsion system, which is the world's most powerful fighter engine.Recent DevelopmentsThe F-35 program is Lockheed Martin’s largest program, which generated 25% of its total net sales and 64% of Aeronautics division’s net sales in 2017. Evidently, the company’s top line grew 12% in the fourth quarter at its Aeronautics segment, primarily driven by the F-35 program.Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin seems to be enjoying a steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon each year and 2018 is no exception. Last month, the company won a modification contract worth $1.5 billion for the purchase of long lead material and parts related to low rate initial production (LRIP) of F-35 Lightning II air systems. Considering these contract wins, we expect the Aeronautics unit to reflect similar solid performance in the first quarter of 2018 as well.Moreover, production of F-35 is expected to continue for many years, given the U.S. government’s current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy; commitments from the company’s eight international partners and three international customers as well as expressions of interest from other countries.Additionally, Trump recently proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisions for a spending plan of $21.7 billion on Aircraft. In particular, the These developments reflect solid growth prospects for Lockheed Martin’s F-35 program, which in turn are likely to boost the company’s profit margin. Budget proposal hints at an increase in Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program and has allotted $10.7 billion for procurement of 77 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters.Price Movement             In the past year, Lockheed Martin has gained about 27.9% compared with the broader industry’s rally of 47.2%.The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically and internationally.Zacks Rank                                                          Lockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1032,UTX,"General Electric Company’s (GE  -  Free Report) Power segment recently upgraded the Iraqi Ministry of Electricity’s Najibiya Power Plant by installing Advanced Gas Path (AGP) gas turbine upgrade solution.The solution is designed to increase the duration between the maintenance inspections of the gas turbines, which will reduce the downtime of the turbines. The solution aims to cater the country’s growing energy requirements by improving availability as well as performance of the plant. This will be achieved by enabling each gas turbine to feed power into the national grid for longer periods. This will lower annual operational and maintenance costs.GE Power’s solution will enable the plant to leverage the existing power generation infrastructure optimally.Apart from delivering the AGP solution, GE Power is also supplying parts, repairs and services to the Najibiya Power Plant. This is in addition to round-the-clock on-site monitoring services for the gas turbines in the facility, which prevent faults and unplanned downtime.GE Power is the biggest segment of the conglomerate in terms of corporate revenues. However, the unit has been a drag on earnings in the last few quarters, as global demand increasingly favours renewable energy sources. Also, overcapacity, lower utilization and fewer outages are other factors that are hurting demand. In 2017, John Flannery, GE’s CEO, assured investors that energy, aviation and healthcare will continue to be the focal points of GE’s operations.It has been nearly five months since Flannery outlined his plan to divest more than $20 billion of assets.Earlier this week, GE inked an agreement to sell a trio of its health-care information technology businesses to private equity firm Veritas Capital for $1.05 billion. The deal marks one of the first notable portfolio-related moves since Flannery announced the plan to exit at least $20 billion of businesses. However, he has indicated at the possibility of the company’s disintegration into separately-traded businesses.The overhaul, coupled with cost cuts and cultural changes, encompass Flannery’s attempts to pull GE out of one of the deepest slumps in its 126-year history. The company’s shares have lost 45.7% in the past six months alone, much wider than the industry’s decline of 12.6%.GE is not the only industrial giant which is contemplating breaking its conglomerate structure. Per recent reports, United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) is considering such a move too. German player Siemens AG (SIEGY  -  Free Report) recently offloaded a part of its Healthineers medical imaging business through an IPO worth $5.2 billion.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderGeneral Electric carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the same space is Leucadia National Corporation , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1033,UTX,"General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) advanced a step closer to streamline operations and sharpen its focus on smart diagnostics and connected devices, as it inked an agreement to sell a trio of its health-care information technology businesses to private equity firm Veritas Capital for $1.05 billion in cash.The transaction includes GE’s Enterprise Financial Management, Ambulatory Care Management and Workforce Management software assets. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of 2018.The healthcare division — GE’s third-largest with sales of $19 billion in 2017 — is a solid cash-generator and includes high-growth markets such as life sciences. But some stakeholders and analysts are of the opinion that the segment doesn’t align well with the company’s primary business of making industrial equipment.This divestiture seems logical, as the conglomerate has struggled to gain a dominant foothold in a crammed market for health-care workforce management and billing software, of late.It has been nearly five months since GE's CEO, John Flannery, outlined his plan to divest more than $20 billion of assets. The plan included GE's iconic lighting unit and its industrial-solutions operations, which the company agreed to sell to ABB Ltd. (ABB  -  Free Report) in September 2017. The company is still scouring for options for its locomotives division, which generates about $4 billion in revenues. However, the universe of buyers for this unit seems limited.Flannery assured investors last year that healthcare will continue to be a focus for GE, along with energy and aviation. However, of late, he has indicated at the possibility of the company’s disintegration into separately traded businesses.The deal marks one of the first notable portfolio-related moves since Flannery announced the plan to exit at least $20 billion of businesses.

1034,UTX,"China is avenging President Donald Trump’s tariffs worth $60 billion on steel, aluminum and other products by imposing import duties on as many as 128 U.S. items including agricultural products, pork and fruits. Undoubtedly, the tariffs imposed by China’s Ministry of Finance, effective Monday, heightened fears of an ensuing trade war.Trump’s tariffs, which were cheered by domestic steel and aluminum producers, were opposed by producers of finished products. Automakers, apparel and shoe manufacturers, which belong to this ilk, will be severely affected by the newly imposed import duties. And if this was not enough, China’s retaliatory tariffs on imports worth $3 billion will only make matters more difficult for a number of U.S. companies, whose revenues depend on bulk exports to China.Naturally, the only option left for these exporters is to cut down on production, which will definitely hurt their revenues unless if these looks for avenues to channelize their exports to other countries. However, it is too early to predict how U.S. exporters will survive the tariff war and think of alternate export routes.Trump Instigates Tariff WarIn late February, Trump raised fears of a trade war when he announced his plans of 25% and 10% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, respectively. In March, the import duties were finally put into motion.The move, which Trump believes will help in rebuilding the domestic steel and aluminum industry that has been treated unfairly by other countries for decades, was cheered by U.S. steelmakers. It saw shares of major steel manufacturers like AK Steel Holding Corp (AKS  -  Free Report) U.S. Steel Corp X, Nucor Corporation NUE and Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report) surging immediately. Also, shares of aluminum producers Century Aluminum Company (CENX  -  Free Report) and Alcoa Corp. (AA  -  Free Report) increased.Manufacturing Blue Chips SufferHowever, the decision drew flak from other quarters that utilize a significant amount of imported steel. Shares of major automakers like General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) and Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report), heavy equipment makers such as Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) and airline manufacturer The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) witnessed a sharp decline. Specifically, shares of General Motors have declined 2.9% in the last months, while Boeing and United Technologies have decreased 4.9% and 3.2%, respectively.Following this, in March, Trump announced plans of slapping tariffs on about $60 billion worth of China imports following an investigation by his administration into the theft of intellectual property from U.S. companies operating in that country. The decision was once again vehemently opposed by retailers and apparel and shoemakers, who rely heavily on imports or have manufacturing units in China.Quite obviously, Trump’s target is China, as a number of U.S. trade partners like Canada, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina have been exempted from the tariffs. Given this scenario, China’s backlash was only a matter of time.China Tariffs to Affect U.S. ExportersChina finally raised import duties on 128 U.S. goods that include pork, aluminum scrap and other agricultural produces on Monday, thus escalating fears of a trade war. China increased tariffs by 25% on eight products that include pork and aluminum scrap, while a 15% import duty has been set for 120 products including apples and almonds. The affected U.S. goods, which include products like pork, wine, fresh fruits, steel pipes, modified ethanol and ginseng, had an import value of $3 billion in 2017.Naturally, this is going to have a negative impact on the bulk exporters of U.S. livestock and agricultural produce. U.S. farmers exported nearly $20 billion of goods to China in 2017. According to the U.S. Meat Export Federation, in 2017, China purchased about $1.1 billion of pork from the United States, making China the third-largest market for U.S. pork. It goes without saying that meat products companies like Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report), Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) and Sanderson Farms, Inc. (SAFM  -  Free Report), which exports huge quantities to China, will feel the pinch because of the new tariffs. Hormel Foods has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Moreover, per the Renewable Fuels Association, China was the third-largest importer of ethanol from the United States in 2016, accounting for almost 20% its total exports. The recent tariffs now put an additional 15% duty along with the existing 30% duty on denatured ethanol imports from the United States. This will only worsen the situation for U.S. exporters.  Also the U.S. apple industry, which exports around 2.5 million cartons of apples to China, is likely to face a major blow with the imposition of tariffs.Interestingly, the dragon has breathed fire on goods that are primarily produced in the U.S. heartlands primarily comprising mid and mid-west states, which had mainly voted for Trump in 2016.  This certainly will not make Trump loyals too happy.In ConclusionAlthough, it is too early to gauge the impact of China’s retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports, it will certainly leave the huge cohort of exporters, which have so long been earning a chunk of their revenues from that country, feeling uneasy. Moreover,  Trump’s voters might be dissatisfied and complaining. The tariffs definitely have escalated fears of a trade war and exports needs to look for new options to survive this onslaught. Let’s see how they to channelize their exports to countries that have been exempted from tariffs.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this year, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

1035,UTX,"Tensions between Washington and Beijing are easing, with signs of negotiations between China and the United States relating to trade. The nations are looking to come to an agreement to prevent long lasting damage to the global economy.President Donald Trump’s proposal to impose tariffs on around $60 billion worth of Chinese imports of IT, telecom and consumer products did not go down well with traders. China retaliated with prospective tariffs on $3 billion worth of U.S. imports. As a result, global stock markets declined sharply last week, owing to fears of an all-out trade war hampering market recovery (read: Trump Tariffs: ETF Winners & Losers).However, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox news that he is hopeful of the United States reaching a deal with China to work on the huge trade deficit. As a result, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 2.8% in a broad-based rally to close at 24,203. Moreover, Standard & Poor's 500 increased 2.7% and the technology heavy Nasdaq gained 3.3%.What the Markets Think?Following the latest developments in the space, investors are now betting on the proposed tariffs as mere negotiation tactics. A war can never be won, because of the everlasting damage it does to both parties. Wall Street thinks denying cheaper goods to consumers will do more harm than good and that free trade will be better for all (read: ETFs to be Impacted by Trump's Tariff Exemptions).""There's too much at stake,"" per a USA Today article citing Joe Quinlan, chief market strategist at U.S. Trust. ""Policy markers understand that the best and fastest way to harm their constituents is to start a trade war and deny voters low-cost goods produced from around the world while tanking global financial markets,"" Quinlan added.“This declaration of tariffs on the president’s part was his typical opening salvo into a negotiation process,” per a TIME article citing Randy Frederick of Charles Schwab. “He’s done these things in the past, and now it looks like the markets are telling us, ‘Yep, that’s what’s happening,'” he added.The numbers also support this move as being a mere negotiation tactic. The United States imported $506 billion worth of goods from China in 2017 and Trump proposed tariffs on merely $60 billion worth of goods. Per a Capital Economics analysis, even if the tariffs are imposed, targeting $60 billion worth of imports will have a negligible impact on the Chinese economy as it contributed to merely 0.25% of China’s GDP in 2017.Let us now discuss a few ETFs likely to benefit from reduced tensions between the two countries.Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK  -  Free Report)The tech sector is heavily dependent on China in terms of their revenue percentage. For instance, per an ejinsight article, Apple earned around 20% of its total revenue from China in the last fiscal quarter. XLK is a relatively cheaper bet on the technology sector. This fund has AUM of $20.2 billion and charges a fee of 13 basis points a year. Apple Inc (AAPL  -  Free Report), Microsoft Corp (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report) are the top three holdings of the fund, with 14.1%, 11.3% and 6.5% allocation, respectively. The fund has returned 28.1% in a year and 4.7% year to date.iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA  -  Free Report)Per Office of the United States Trade Representative, the aerospace sector exported $15 billion worth of goods to China in 2016. This fund seeks to provide exposure to the Aerospace and Defense industry. It has AUM of $5.8 billion and charges a fee of 44 basis points a year. Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), United Technologies Corp (UTX  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT  -  Free Report) are the top three holdings of the fund, with 10.4%, 7.5% and 7.4% allocation, respectively. ITA has returned 37.1% in a year and 6.5% year to date.First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index Fund (CARZ  -  Free Report)Per Office of the United States Trade Representative, the auto sector exported $11 billion worth of goods to China in 2016.

1036,UTX,"Shares of General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) slumped more than 1.5% in morning trading Thursday, adding to the conglomerate’s recent losses amid a tariff scare that has seen investors ditch major U.S. industrials and importers.GE is now down more than 50% over the past year, and as mounting debt issues continue to create headwinds, this once-iconic American brand seems to be on the brink of losing its place in the global economic conversation.But has the selloff extended too far? Could now be a great opportunity to buy GE at a major discount? Let’s take a closer look.Recent ChallengesOn top of sluggish activity in its core businesses and an intimidating debt pile, General Electric faces regulatory challenges. The company recently adopted new accounting standards that restated its earnings for fiscal 2016 and 2017—a move that came on the back of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into GE’s accounting for lengthy service contracts.The once-dominant industrial behemoth also faces potential legal action over allegations that two of its financial units violated U.S. law related to subprime mortgages. General Electric is now looking to shed as much as $20 billion worth of assets to trim some of the fat from its existing structure.Furthermore, President Trump’s recent tariffs on imported steel and aluminum could lead to a rapid rise in prices that would force GE to re-value its backlog, while an all-out trade war against a major economy like China could see companies like GE face retaliation.What’s more, a recent analyst note from JPMorgan questioned whether General Electric’s earnings guidance is realistic. The firm argued that GE’s guidance for full-year earnings of $1.00 per share is “not credible” and fundamentally “disconnected” from its free cash flow guidance of $0.75 based on the effect of asset sales.Current ValuationDespite all these challenges, value investors might be interested in GE following its significant slump. After all, if the company avoids a catastrophic situation like bankruptcy, the stock could very well rebound from its current lows.But even still, traditional valuation models do not show that GE is trading at any sort of discount right now. When considering companies in GE’s peer group, including other massive conglomerates like Honeywell (HON  -  Free Report) and United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report), its Forward P/E trend is hardly attractive: Considering how drastically GE has been sold off within the past year, it might surprise investors to learn that the stock is still trading at a slight premium to its larger peer group. In addition to this unattractive P/E, General Electric’s PEG ratio of 2.6 is not great, and its current cash flow of $1.69 per share is less than the industry average of $2.05.Overall, GE is holding a mediocre “C” grade for Value in our Style Scores system.Estimate Revision TrendsGeneral Electric is also currently sporting a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). But the Zacks Rank does not necessarily consider the aforementioned valuation metrics. Instead, the proven strategy focuses on earnings estimates and estimates revisions to determine which stocks have an improving outlook and which stocks are trending in the wrong direction.Here’s a look at the revision trend for GE: As we can see, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has come down significantly on the back of universal downward agreement among revising analysts.Some might assume that the worst of the damage is already done for GE, but analyst estimates actually tend to come down gradually over time. As GE continues to struggle, analysts could become increasingly bearish, adding even more volatility to the stock.Want more market analysis from this author?

1037,UTX,"Kidde, a division of United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), has acknowledged that its 425,000 sensor smoke alarms have manufacturing defects and the risk of failing to alarm the owners in case of a fire.The defective products include PI2010 and PI9010 models. Sold at stores from Sep 10, 2016 to Oct 13, 2017, these products have been called back by the company, keeping in mind consumer safety. While some units were also sold on ShopKidde.com and other websites in January 2018 for $20 to $40 per piece, 40,000 units were sold in Canada.  Per the company, a yellow cap left on during the manufacturing process can cover one of the two smoke sensors and compromise the smoke alarm's ability to detect smoke. Customers are advised to remove the alarm and check whether a yellow cap is visible through the opening on the side. They are advised not to take the alarm apart or attempt to remove the yellow cap themselves but to immediately contact the company and request for a replacement.Kidde has also worked closely with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and other relevant authorities to voluntarily initiate a recall and ensure that defective smoke alarms are replaced with new models as early as possible.In the last three months, the company’s shares have outperformed the industry. While United Technologies has lost 0.2%, the industry declined 5.2%. However, the recent product recall could impair the credibility of the company and hurt its shares in the long term.Meanwhile, the company continues to invest in innovative products by increasing engineering expenditures, delivering value to its customers and securing orders that should drive top-line growth in future.  Furthermore, United Technologies’ aftermarket services business seems to be relatively stable compared with new product delivery. This, in turn, helps it to offset the downturns in the new products market. Also, the company generates solid free cash flow through a disciplined capital deployment strategy.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksUnited Technologies has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1038,UTX,"Pratt & Whitney, one of the operating segments of diversified conglomerate United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), according to a Reuters article, has come to the rescue of Indigo Airlines — the biggest carrier in India by market share — by offering spare engines for its grounded jets. The strategic initiative is likely to provide some respite to the beleaguered airlines firm that was forced to cancel about 35-45 flights a day due to technical snag of the engines.The problem stemmed from a series of in-flight engine failures related to the Airbus A320neo aircrafts that use Pratt & Whitney PW1100G engines. The issue was with a knife-edge seal in the high-pressure compressor aft hub on the engine, causing vibrations and three in-service shutdowns. This forced the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) — the regulatory body of India in the field of civil aviation, primarily dealing with safety issues — to ground 11 aircraft fitted with such engines, eight of which belonged to Indigo.Pratt & Whitney has faced recurring problems with these engines that led to repeated grounding of jets in India. In last July, Indigo was forced to take seven aircrafts out of action due to engine failures, while DGCA grounded three more jets in February 2018. Although Pratt & Whitney replaced the original seal in an effort to reduce the planned service interval due to higher degradation, the problem failed to subside.In order to address the current grounding of flights, Pratt & Whitney has reportedly decided to deliver two spare engines today and the remaining within the next 40 days. It is yet to be seen if the company can come up with a permanent solution to fix the issues with these engines of Airbus narrow-body planes.Industry observers widely expected Pratt & Whitney engine business to be the profit driver for its parent firm, United Technologies. However, the engines have failed to live up to the expectations and the business seems to be a drag on overall earnings. Nevertheless, United Technologies has outperformed the industry with an average loss of 0.1% in the last three months compared with a decline of 5.8% for the latter.Despite the current setbacks, the PW1100 engines have proven its mettle in the industry. It has been able to meet the strict quality standards relating to burn, noise and emissions. The engine has the ability to reduce engine fuel consumption by 15% and regulate noise footprint by 50%.Pratt & Whitney is among the world’s leading suppliers of aircraft engines to the commercial, military, business jet and general aviation markets. Its Global Services provide maintenance, repair and overhaul services, including the sale of spare parts and fleet management services for large commercial engines.United Technologies has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the industry are 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report), Federal Signal Corporation (FSS  -  Free Report) and Crane Co. (CR  -  Free Report), each carrying Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.3M has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 10.2%.

1039,UTX,"Pratt & Whitney, a subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), has acknowledged technical glitches with respect to its newly modified turbofan jet engine. The discovery of these problems has caused the delivery of latest Airbus aircraft to come to a standstill. Taking the event into account, Europe’s air safety regulator issued an emergency warning to the company about inflight shutdown of such engines as these could lead to fatal consequences.Pratt & Whitney reported that the issue affects 43 engines on A320neo aircraft and believes it to have occurred from an engineering change made to knife-edge seal in the high-pressure compressor near the rear of aircraft’s engine.           United Technologies shares fell 3% last week following the news but has since recovered. The stock has outperformed the industry in the last three months, with an average return of 7.3% against a loss of 3.7% for the latter.The incident hurt the company’s reputation as some investors were reluctant to park their money with it. Moreover, it hindered the growing demand for Airbus jet engines internationally as the deliveries were not made to the clients on time. Further, investors seem to be worried as to how the company would fix the relevant technical issues, come up with remedial measures and checks to avoid repetition of such incidents. Moving forward, Pratt & Whitney ensured Europe’s air safety regulator of its sheer determination to find and present a solution for the highlighted issue at the earliest. An early fix to these problems, as suggested by Pratt & Whitney, will likely help the company to mitigate risks related to its future revenue-generating potential and bottom-line growth.United Technologies has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the industry include Federal Signal Corporation (FSS  -  Free Report) and Raven Industries, Inc. (RAVN  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report), carrying Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

1040,UTX,"The earnings season is well past the halfway mark with about 294 S&P 500 companies having reported results till Feb 7, 2018. Various analysis and comparisons are being done by industry peers to gauge the underlying metrics and relative performance. Let us perform a similar analysis of two leading players in the Conglomerates sector to pick the best investment option based on the fourth-quarter earnings scorecard.Fourth-Quarter EarningsUnited Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) reported healthy results driven by significant organic growth and diligent execution of operational plans. GAAP earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were $397 million or 50 cents per share compared with $1,013 million or $1.25 per share in the year-earlier quarter. Excluding restructuring and other non-recurring items, adjusted earnings for the reported quarter were $1.60 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.56.Net sales came in at $15,680 million compared with $14,659 million in the year-ago quarter. Quarterly sales exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15,400 million. The top-line increase was primarily attributable to organic growth of 5% — the highest since 2014. Growth in revenues across all segments of the company helped drive total revenues. An increase in demand for the company’s products by the commercial aviation industry and an increase in spending by the U.S. defense industry have helped augment revenues for the company. The strong aftermarket business, which sells spare parts and offers related services to keep the primary products running, has also benefited results. United Technologies carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) reported solid results with healthy year-over-year increase in revenues and adjusted earnings. GAAP loss for the quarter was $2,411 million or loss of $3.18 a share as against net income of $1,034 million or $1.34 per share in the year-ago quarter. The significant decline in GAAP earnings was primarily attributable to a provisional charge of $3.8 billion to reflect the estimated impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings for the quarter were $1.85 per share compared with $1.74 in the year-earlier quarter. Adjusted earnings for the reported quarter beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.Fourth-quarter revenues jumped 8.6% year over year to $10,843 million and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10,689 million. The top-line improvement was largely due to organic growth of 6%, driven by strength in Aerospace aftermarket, UOP, Advanced Materials and Intelligrated.GuidanceUnited Technologies is poised to grow on the back of continued investments, strategic cost-reduction efforts and a favorable global macroeconomic environment. Backed by these positives, the company has given bullish full-year 2018 earnings guidance. Adjusted earnings are anticipated to lie within the $6.85-$7.10 per share range. Additionally, the company has given revenue guidance for 2018 between $62.5 billion and $64 billion (estimating organic growth of 4-6% year over year).Concurrent with the earnings release, Honeywell revised full-year 2018 earnings guidance to better reflect the favorable impact from the tax reform. The company currently anticipates earnings within the range of $7.75-$8.00 per share for 2018, up from earlier expectations of $7.55−$7.80, representing year-over-year growth of 9-13%, up from 6-10% expected earlier. However, revenue guidance is affirmed at $41.8-$42.5 billion.Price PerformanceFrom earnings release to date, United Technologies has outperformed the industry with an average loss of 2.8% compared with 5.6% decline for the latter. Honeywell, on the other hand, has underperformed the industry with an average loss of 8.4% compared with 7.2% decline for the latter.Estimate RevisionsLast month, United Technologies’ current-quarter estimates increased to $1.50 per share from $1.47 while that for the current year increased from $6.86 to $7.01.Honeywell’s current-quarter estimates improved to $1.88 during the last month from $1.81, while current-year estimates increased to $7.95 per share from $7.75.To Sum UpBased on the current scenario, although there is not much to choose from as the stocks seem to match on most counts, United Technologies seems to have trumped Honeywell only on the basis of price performance and stands out as a better investment proposition.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

1041,UTX,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business segment recently clinched a contract in relation to F-35 jets. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by December 2018.Details of the DealValued at $14.4 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland. Per the terms of the deal, the company will offer emerging capabilities and analysis systems engineering to include programmatic and logistics tasks. These efforts will analyze the F-35 air system's ability to meet future operational requirements, investigate cost and weight reduction program options, and conduct modeling and simulation activities.The contract also include provisions for additional assessments such as analyzing changes to design life, operational readiness, reliability, and air system design and configuration.  Fiscal 2018 research, development, test and evaluation (Navy) funds will be utilized to complete the task at Fort Worth, TX.F-35 AttributesLockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is a single-seat, single-engine 5th Generation fighter aircraft, which comes with an advanced stealth feature combined with enhanced fighter speed and agility, fully-fused sensor information, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment. Currently, three variants of F-35 are set to replace five fighter jets for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps as well as a variety of fighter jets for at least 10 other countries.With Lockheed Martin being the primary partner, the F-35 program has been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors. While, Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) rendered its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology to this program, BAE Systems’ (BAESY  -  Free Report) short takeoff and vertical landing experience, and air systems sustainment supported the jet’s combat capabilities. Also, Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report), provided F-35s with the F135 propulsion system — the world's most powerful fighter engine.Recent DevelopmentsThe F-35 program is Lockheed Martin’s largest program, which generated 24% of its total net sales in first-quarter 2018. As of May 14, 2018, the company delivered more than 290 F-35 jets to the United States and its allies.However, critics earlier condemned this program as the costliest military program for the U.S. government. It was only after President Trump’s intervention, in February 2017, that Lockheed Martin ultimately announced its decision to cut down F-35’s cost significantly.Now, the company’s current cost-saving initiative to lower sustainment costs for F-35 project is expected to result in cost savings of $1 billion over a five-year period. In sync with this, per a recent report by Lockheed Martin, it targets to reduce the cost of an F-35A to $80 million by 2020, with production enhancements.Also, additional improvements implemented in these planes like the software upgrades, which were a part of this latest contract, will allow the company to further reduce the cost of this program. Moreover, with the U.S. government’s current inventory objective of 2,456 F-35 aircraft alongside its reduced price we may expect to witness a continued ramp up in the production of these jets in coming days. No doubt, Lockheed Martin enjoys a solid growth prospect for F-35 program, which in turn, will surely boost its profit margin.Price MovementIn a year’s time, shares of Lockheed Martin have rallied about 15.5% compared with the industry’s increase of 41.7%. The underperformance was most probably caused by the intense competition that the company faces domestically as well as internationally. Zacks Rank Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1042,UTX,"3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) recently announced the sale of substantial part of its Communication Markets Division to Corning Incorporated. Notably, Corning is a premier manufacturer of glass, ceramics and related materials for industrial and scientific applications. The transaction worth $870 million is likely to generate a full-year 2018 earnings benefit of 40-45 cents per share to 3M.The Communication Markets Division incorporates the company’s optical and copper passive connectivity solutions such as xDSL, FTTx and structured cabling solutions. The sale of the remaining telecommunications system integration services business, which remains pending, is likely to be completed later in 2018 for about $30 million.Existing Business ScenarioBeing one of the most recognized and trusted brand globally, 3M remains focused on inventing new products with its scientists and innovators. This, in turn, gives the company a worldwide competitive advantage over its peers. Also, 3M is investing heavily to bolster its competitive edge in the future. Meanwhile, the company’s portfolio restructuring efforts by divesting assets that no longer fit in its strategy are commendable. It continues to invest in other lucrative markets as well. In a year’s time, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 2.2%, outperforming the industry’s decline of 14.4%. 3M has also initiated some prudent steps to strengthen and focus on its core portfolio of businesses. Since 2012, the company has streamlined its businesses to a large extent, thereby improving customer relevance, productivity and speed through a leaner operating structure. At the same time, it has maintained a steady investment in R&D to develop innovative products.Portfolio management, investment in innovation and business transformation are the three key levers on which the company intends to focus moving forward. Moreover, 3M’s global footprint, diversified product portfolio and ability to penetrate in different markets have been its forte.However, 3M’s growth objectives are largely dependent on timing and market acceptances of its new product offerings, including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new offerings and bring those to market at acceptable price points.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), Federal Signal Corporation (FSS  -  Free Report) and Raven Industries, Inc. (RAVN  -  Free Report). Each of the stocks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1043,UTX,"Tuesday, July 25th, 2017Following the sell-off that came after Google parent company Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) bottom-line miss after the bell yesterday — based on a gigantic one-time payout of a settlement with the EU for $2.7 billion — Q2 earnings season does not pump the breaks; it keeps going, with several Dow components having reported before the bell today. As far as Alphabet is concerned, investors will be looking for signs that anti-trust cases like the one that resulted in the GOOGL settlement with the EU was a simple anomaly or a sign of things to come for the search giant.McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) kept its impressive streak of positive earnings surprises alive with an 11-cent beat to $1.73 per share, on quarterly sales of nearly $6.05 billion, higher than the $6 billion expected. Strong global comps bolstered the quick-service giant, up 6.6% year after year (+4% in the previous quarter), and pre-market trading of MCD shares is up 3% at this hour. We look for a possible change to its current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating in the coming days.Farm and mining equipment major Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) posted $1.49 per share this morning on $11.3 billion in revenues, surpassing the $1.26 per share and $10.95 billion estimated. This marks at least the fifth straight positive earnings surprise for the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company, which also raised 2017 guidance for both sales and earnings. CAT stock is up 5% in today’s pre-market.Chemicals giant DuPont  also kept a nice string of earnings beats alive this morning, putting up $1.38 per share, ahead of the $1.29 in the Zacks consensus estimate. Revenues grew 5% year over year to $7.42 billion, higher than the $7.26 billion expected. The Zacks Rank #3 company looks toward its merger with Dow Chemical  next month, with spinoffs to follow in the moths ahead.Minnesota-based 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) missed estimates on both top and bottom lines this morning, falling short on the bottom line by a penny to $2.58 per share on quarterly sales of $7.81 billion, beneath the Zacks consensus estimate of $7.88 billion. That said, the conglomerate raised the bottom end of its 2017 earnings guidance, though shares are selling off a bit in toad’s pre-market.Finally, United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report) topped earnings estimates by 8 cents to $1.85 per share on $15.28 billion in revenues for Q2, ahead of the $15.18 billion expected. The company has also raised the lower end of its guidance this morning, and we see shares of UTX trading up 1.5% in today’s early market.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

1044,UTX,"Diversified electronics manufacturer Amphenol Corporation (APH  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 26. In the last reported quarter, adjusted earnings comfortably exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents. Amphenol surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 5.6%. Let's see how things are shaping up for the upcoming results.Key Factors in the QuarterAmphenol’s top-line growth is expected to benefit from improved end-market demand, new product rollouts and market share gains. Demand continues to be strong in automotive industrial, mobile networks and military markets. The diversification in end markets with a consistent focus on technology innovation and customer support through all phases of the economic cycle is likely to help the company achieve solid top-line growth.Amphenol remains encouraged by its expanding presence in the fast-growing commercial aerospace market and is well positioned to capitalize on the proliferation of electronics content on next-generation planes. These advanced electronic systems require new higher technology interconnect solutions to enhance fuel efficiency and improve passenger experience, all of which create excellent opportunities for Amphenol.In order to fuel further growth, Amphenol aims to make acquisitions on a global basis in the high-growth segments that have complementary capabilities from a product, customer and/or geographic standpoint. Amphenol also expects to leverage on the solid growth potential of the acquired companies to drive robust performance. A balanced organic and inorganic growth model, a lean and flexible cost structure, and an agile and entrepreneurial management team augur well for the company. For the to-be-reported quarter, Amphenol expects adjusted earnings of 70–72 cents per share on revenues of $1.580–$1.620 billion. We expect the company to record year-over-year growth of 10.3% and 3.6% in earnings and revenues, respectively, in the second quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Amphenol is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

1045,UTX,"Lockheed Martin Corp.'s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business division has won a modification contract to identify and execute cost savings projects in order to reduce the cost of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter air system.Contract DetailsValued at $60million, the contract has been awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.The work is scheduled to be completed by July 2020 and will use fiscal 2017 aircraft procurement (Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps) funds. While majority of the work related to this contract will be carried out in Fort Worth, TX, the rest will be performed in multiple locations across the United States and the United Kingdom.F-35 AttributesLockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is a single-seat and single-engine 5th Generation fighter aircraft, which comes with an advanced stealth feature combined with enhanced fighter speed and agility, fully fused sensor information, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment. Currently, three variants of F-35 are set to replace five fighter jets for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps as well as a variety of fighter jets for at least 10 other countries.Notably, the F-35 program has been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors with Lockheed Martin being the primary partner. Evidently, Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) contributed its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology to this program, BAE Systems plc’s (BAESY  -  Free Report) short takeoff and vertical landing experience as well as air systems sustainment supported the jet’s combat capabilities. In addition, Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), provided F-35s with the F135 propulsion system, which is the world's most powerful fighter engine.Our ViewWe remind investors that despite offering superior air security and stability, the F-35 program has been facing some engine-related technical issues for the last few years. Additionally, it has been repeatedly criticized by President Trump on being an overtly expensive project. In this context, Lockheed Martin finally inked a deal worth $8.5 billion with Pentagon this February with the intent of delivering 90 F-35s of the 10th Lot at a historically low rate either forced by Trump’s intervention or to keep management’s earlier promise to cut down cost by 6–7%.Going forward, Lockheed Martin's management is likely to adopt a cost-saving initiative to lower sustainment costs for F-35 by 10%, over the next couple of years. This, in turn, is anticipated to result in cost savings of $1 billion over a five-year period.In fact, we believe the recent contract win will enable the company to take a step toward achieving its goal and allow it to provide more of these combat aircraft at an efficiently reduced rate.Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin is enjoying steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon since reduction of its F-35 price. In July, Lockheed Martin won a modification contract, worth $5.6 billion, to offer low-rate initial production of the 11th lot of F-35 Lightening II Joint Strike Fighter.Furthermore, with the U.S. government expecting to spend approximately $400 billion in the upcoming decades for the development and purchase of 2,443 F-35 jets, Lockheed Martin is trying its best to effectively reduce the price of this program. Also, the government is likely to place larger orders, thus boosting the company’s profits in the near term.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1048,UTX,"United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, before the opening bell. The company is likely to report higher revenues in the impending quarterly results, owing to overall favorable macroeconomic environment and strong demand.United Technologies has a decent earnings surprise history, having trumped estimates in the trailing four quarters for an average beat of 4.1%. In the last reported quarter, the company pulled off a positive surprise of 2.6%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderRevenues of the company are largely affected by spending in the U.S. military and commercial aviation industries. An increase in demand for the company’s products in these industries is expected to favorably impact its financial performance, which will be reflected in the upcoming results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter of 2018 revenues is pegged at $14,537 million, higher than reported revenues of $13,815 million in the prior-year quarter. Revenues across Otis, Pratt & Whitney and Aerospace Systems segments are expected to increase year over year to $2,875 million, $4,280 million and $3,642 million from $2,804 million, $3,758 million and $3,611 million, respectively. UTC Climate, Controls & Security revenues are expected to come in at $4,087 million, up from $3,892 million in the year-ago quarter.In September 2017, United Technologies announced its plans to acquire Rockwell Collins, an Iowa-based avionics firm. Post the acquisition, United Technologies is expected to emerge as one of the world’s largest aircraft equipment manufacturers. The acquisition, slated to be completed by the third quarter of 2018, will provide a huge competitive advantage to the company and increase its bargaining power. The resultant operating synergies and lower operating costs will help it create complementary products that will help it serve evolving global customer needs.The merger is expected to be a huge boost to the company’s revenues and adjusted earnings per share after the first year of combined operations with synergies worth more than $500 million. Although the transaction will not have any direct impact on earnings in the quarter, it is likely to attract similar profitable deals for the company that will augment overall revenues in the quarter.Separately, the strong aftermarket business that sells spare parts and offers related services to keep the primary products running is likely to record a healthy growth momentum with uptick in the economy. Furthermore, continued focus on four key priorities to fuel its growth momentum, namely flawless execution, innovation for growth, structural cost reduction and disciplined capital allocation is likely to translate to improved performance in the quarter.United Technologies Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise United Technologies Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | United Technologies Corporation QuoteHowever, the company registered significant margin contraction in fourth-quarter 2017, as rise in operating expenses overshadowed top-line growth. If the operating expenses continue to reflect upward momentum, margins for the quarter under review will be pressurized.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that United Technologies is likely to beat estimates in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

1049,UTX,"General Electric Company’s (GE  -  Free Report) shares jumped 6% at a point in pre-market trading, as investors cheered the company’s strong earnings and revenues beats. The company started 2018 on a robust note as it reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 16 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 11 cents.The company’s bottom line benefited from strong performance in Aviation and Healthcare businesses. Also, robust cost controls drove profits.GAAP earnings from continuing operations for the reported quarter came in at 6 cents a share compared with 5 cents in the year-ago quarter.RevenuesTotal consolidated revenues for the reported quarter rose 7% year over year to $28,660 million and trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $27,884 million. While the Industrial segment revenues improved 9% year over year to $27,395 million, GE Capital revenues declined 19% to $2,173 million. Organic revenues for the Industrial segment fell 4% for the quarter to $23,817 million.Total orders for the quarter for the Industrial segment increased 10% year over year to $27.4 billion, with significant order improvements from the Renewable Energy segment (up 15%), Aviation unit (up 13%) and Transportation (up 46%). These were partially offset by persistent decline in Power (down 29%). General Electric Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  General Electric Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | General Electric Company Quote Revenues by SegmentsRevenues from Lighting inched down 1% to $456 million with lower revenues from the legacy lighting businesses, while Oil & Gas revenues were up 74% year over year to $5,385 million due to improved revenue contribution from Baker Hughes. Revenues from the Aviation segment rose 7% to $7,112 million, while Transportation revenues declined 11% year over year to $872 million on lower locomotive volume.Power segment revenues were down 9% year over year to $7,222 million with lower demand for turbines, while revenues from the Healthcare segment improved 9% to $4,702 million owing to solid volumes. Revenues from the Renewable Energy segment declined 7% year over year to $1,646 million, thanks to lower Onshore Wind equipment sales. GE Capital segment generated a loss of $1,768 million.Margins, Balance Sheet and Cash FlowDriven by stringent cost-cutting and simplification initiatives, GE recorded higher margins in the reported quarter. The company reduced Industrial structural costs by $805 million in the quarter and is on track to exceed its cost reduction target of $2 billion in 2018.Adjusted Industrial segment operating profit increased 15% year over year to $2,745 million, while margins expanded 60 basis points (bps) year over year. Improvement in profits in Aviation (up 26%), Transportation (up 37%), Renewable Energy (up 10%) and Healthcare (up 11%) was partially offset by a decline in Power (down 38%) and Oil & Gas (down 30%).GE Power is the largest business segment of the company in terms of corporate revenues. However, the business has been a drag on earnings in the last few quarters as global demand waned with increasing popularity of renewable energy sources, overcapacity, lower utilization and fewer outages. Industry experts opine that the acquisition of Alstom’s assets for $10 billion in 2015 further compounded the problems for General Electric, as it increased operating costs and contracted margins.Cash used in operating industrial activities for the quarter (excluding deal taxes and pension plan) totaled $1,681 million, up 39% year over year. Cash and marketable securities at year-end 2017 aggregated $69.3 billion compared with $82.7 billion in the year-ago period.OutlookGE reiterated its guidance for 2018. The company continues to project operating earnings in the range of $1.00–$1.07, with momentum in Aviation and Healthcare and persistent challenges in the Power segment. The company expects a gradual improvement in earnings with structural changes, simplification and cost-cutting initiatives.The steady outlook was a source of comfort to investors who have been suffering one of the deepest slumps in GE’s 126-year history. GE also reassured that it’s progressing on its plan to divest more than $20 billion of assets. The company’s CEO John Flannery is now considering all options — including a break up as he seeks to turn around the beleaguered maker of jet engines and power equipment.GE is not the only industrial giant which is contemplating a disintegration of its conglomerate structure. Per recent reports, United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) is considering a similar move. Recently, German player Siemens AG (SIEGY  -  Free Report) offloaded a part of its Healthineers medical imaging business through an IPO worth $5.2 billion.Stock to ConsiderGeneral Electric carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the same space is Federal Signal Corporation (FSS  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1050,UTX,"United Technologies Corporation’s (UTX  -  Free Report) operating segment, Pratt & Whitney announced that it has been awarded a $2-billion contract for the 11th lot of F135 propulsion systems, which will support all three variants of the F-35 Lightning II aircraft.The latest contract intends to reduce the propulsion system price, supporting the program affordability initiatives. Notably, this 11th low rate initial production (LRIP) contract will deal with 135 engines, apart from covering areas like program management, production support, engineering support, spare modules as well as spare parts.Also, the contract is likely to reduce the unit recurring flyaway (URF) price for the 110 LRIP Lot 11 conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) and carrier variant (CV) propulsion systems by 0.34% from the earlier negotiated LRIP Lot 10 URF. Furthermore, the URF price for the 25 LRIP Lot 11 short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) propulsion systems is expected to be reduced by 3.39% compared with the earlier negotiated LRIP Lot 10 URF.Our TakeUnited Technologies has a strong aftermarket business. In fact, its aftermarket services business is relatively stable compared to new product delivery. This, in turn, helps offset the negative impact of downturns in the new products market. For instance, in first-quarter 2018, the company’s aftermarket business witnessed increased sales across the segments with commercial and military up 18% and 13%, respectively.Moreover, the company’s business mix and diversification allow it to remain profitable even during tough economic times, delivering persistent earnings and dividend growth. In the past six months, shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have gained 3.9% against the industry’s decline of 7.3%. Furthermore, the company’s strong cash flow and disciplined capital deployment strategy enable it to invest in acquisitions and business development. In addition, its continuous investment in innovative products through higher engineering expenditure delivers value to its customers and secures orders that will drive top line growth in future.This apart, the acquisition of Rockwell Collins will offer United Technologies a bigger clout in the industry and increase its bargaining power as it would emerge as one of the largest aircraft equipment manufacturers in the world.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the same space include Honeywell International Inc.

1051,UTX,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business segment recently secured a delivery order in relation to F-35 jets. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by June 2019.Details of the DealValued at $46.6 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD. Per the terms of the deal, the company will provide non-recurring engineering, the development of design documentation, and the creation of modification instructions.These efforts will support service life extension and enable the developmental test F-35 aircraft to maintain currency with delivered technology.  Notably, the project includes 38% of the work for the U.S. Navy, 38% for the Marine Corps and 24% for non-U.S. DoD participants. Fiscal 2018 research, development, test and evaluation (Navy and Marine Corps); and non-U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) participant funds will be utilized to complete the task at Fort Worth, TX.F-35 AttributesLockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is a single-seat, single-engine 5th Generation fighter aircraft, which comes with an advanced stealth feature combined with enhanced fighter speed and agility, fully-fused sensor information, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment. Currently, three variants of F-35 are set to replace five fighter jets for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps as well as a variety of fighter jets for at least 10 other countries.With Lockheed Martin being the primary partner, the F-35 program has been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors. Notably, Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) rendered its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology to this program, BAE Systems’ (BAESY  -  Free Report) short takeoff and vertical landing experience, and air systems sustainment supported the jet’s combat capabilities. Also, Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report), provided F-35s with the F135 propulsion system — the world's most powerful fighter engine.Recent DevelopmentsThe F-35 program is Lockheed Martin’s largest program, which generated 24% of its total net sales in first quarter of 2018. As of May 14, 2018, the company delivered more than 290 F-35 jets to the United States and its allies.However, critics have condemned this program as the costliest military program for the U.S. government. It was only after President Trump’s intervention, in February 2017, that Lockheed Martin ultimately announced its decision to cut down F-35’s cost significantly.Now, the company’s current cost-saving initiative to lower sustainment costs for F-35 project is expected to result in cost savings of $1 billion over a five-year period. In sync with this, per a recent report by Lockheed Martin, it targets to reduce the cost of an F-35A to $80 million by 2020, with production enhancements.Also, additional improvements implemented in these planes like the software upgrades, which were a part of this latest contract, will allow the company to further reduce the cost of this program. Moreover, with the U.S. government’s current inventory objective of 2,456 F-35 aircraft alongside its reduced price we may expect to witness a continued ramp up in the production of these jets, in coming days. No doubt, Lockheed Martin enjoys a solid growth prospect for F-35 program, which in turn, will surely boost its profit margin.Price MovementIn a year’s time, shares of Lockheed Martin have rallied about 14.2% compared with the broader industry’s increase of 39.7%. The underperformance was most probably caused by intense competition that the company faces domestically as well as internationally.Zacks Rank Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1053,UTX,"The earnings season is in full swing with about 183 S&P 500 companies reporting this week. About 97 S&P 500 companies have already released their results till Jul 21, reconfirming broad-based expectations of better-than expected earnings. Total earnings for these 97 companies (accounting for 28.1% of the index’s total market capitalization) are up 8.4% year over year on 5.1% higher revenues, with 78.4% beating earnings estimates and 72.2% surpassing top-line expectations. Based on the hitherto observed pattern, the second quarter is anticipated to register high single-digit percentage earnings growth on a year-over-year basis.Per the latest Earnings Preview, overall second-quarter earnings for all the S&P 500 companies are expected to be up 8.6% on 4.7% growth in revenues. Although it represents a slightly tempered growth projection compared with the double-digit growth rate of the first quarter, the dollar amount of the total earnings is likely to be on par or even better than the all-time high achieved in fourth-quarter 2016. The relative improvement in the quarterly performance is largely due to a turnaround in the economy, better job market scenario and rising oil prices. Experts widely believe that earnings growth is likely to be in double digits in 2018 and beyond.For the second quarter as a whole, about five of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to witness an earnings decline, with Autos, Conglomerates and Utilities being the biggest drag.The Conglomerates sector appears to be a major decliner. For the sector, earnings are expected to decline 19.2% year over year while sales are touted to fall 6.1% due to a likely disappointing performance by some of the leading players in the industry.Let’s have a sneak peek at three major Conglomerates scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 earnings tomorrow to see how things are shaping up for the upcoming results.3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report results before the opening bell. 3M expects to deliver sustainable increase in earnings and free cash flow, driven by benefits from long-term strategy of investment in high-growth programs.

1054,UTX,"Benchmarks closed in the red on Thursday after President Trump said that new tariffs will be imposed on aluminum and steel imports by the U.S. next week. After this development, all the three key indexes started this month with heavy losses following concerns over a possible trade war and aggravated worries over higher inflation.The market’s fear gauge rose to its highest level since early February, moving above 20. A reading above 20 is considered alarming and indicates that the broader market is in turmoil. All the three indexes continued to decline for three consecutive trading days with the Dow down 0.4% for the year. However, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are still up 0.4% and 4%, respectively, for 2018.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 1.7%, or 428.21 points, to close at 24,608.98. The S&P 500 fell 1.4% to close at 2,677.67. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,180.56, losing 1.3%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 11.7% to close at 22.17. A total of 9 billion shares were traded on Thursday, higher than the last 20-session average of 8.4 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.47-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.42-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Markets Stumbles for Three Straight DaysOn Thursday, President Trump said the U.S. will announce new tariffs of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports next week. He added that this move will come as the U.S. will be “going to build our steel industry back and our aluminum industry back.” Following this announcement, fears of a possible retaliation from countries like China and Canada and the European Union heightened. Additionally, worries over inflation arose following this development as such tariffs might lead to an increase in prices of imports. This in turn may raise the overall price level. Investors switched from equities to bonds on Thursday, following which bond prices increased. Rise in bond prices weighed on the yield of 10-year Treasury note, which fell from 2.870% Wednesday to 2.802% on Thursday, its worst fall in six months.The Dow lost more than 420 points on Thursday. For the S&P 500 index, 10 of the 11 sectors finished in the red with industrials and financials emerging as the biggest drag on the S&P 500. The Industrial Select Sector SPDR (XLI) decreased 2%, becoming the worst performer among the S&P 500 sectors. Consumers of steel and aluminum registered sharp declines following Trump’s announcement of new tariffs. Dow components, United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) fell 3.3%, 3.5% and 1.8%, respectively.Additionally, the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) declined 1.8% and was the second biggest loser among the key S&P 500 sectors.

1058,UTX,"Industrial goods manufacturer General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) reported relatively modest fourth-quarter 2017 results on the back of some key initiatives. GAAP loss from continuing operations for the reported quarter were $9,863 million or loss of $1.15 a share compared with net earnings of $3,659 million or 39 cents a share in the year-ago quarter. The significant year-over-year decline in GAAP earnings was primarily attributable to charges related to legacy insurance businesses to the tune of $1.49 per share. Excluding these charges, industrial and other verticals operating earnings were 27 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 28 cents.For full year 2017, the company reported industrial and other verticals operating earnings (excluding fourth-quarter charges) of $1.05 per share compared with $1.49 in 2016.RevenuesTotal consolidated revenue for the reported quarter decreased 5% year over year to $31,402 million and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $32,873 million. While the Industrial segment revenue improved 3% year over year to $32,214 million, GE Capital revenues declined 42% to $1,545 million. Organic revenues for the Industrial segment decreased 6% for the quarter to $28,712 million. For full year 2017, the company reported revenues of $122,092 million compared with $123,693 million in 2016.Total orders for the quarter for the Industrial segment increased 3% year over year to $35 billion, with significant order improvements from the Oil & Gas segment (up 73%) and Transportation (up 56%), partially offset by decline in Power (down 25%). Total backlog of equipment and services at quarter-end was $341.3 billion, up 6% year over year.General Electric Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  General Electric Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | General Electric Company QuoteRevenue by SegmentRevenues from Lighting decreased 7% to $546 million with lower revenues from the legacy lighting businesses, while Oil & Gas revenues were up 69% year over year to $5,756 million due to improved revenue contribution from Baker Hughes. Revenues from the Aviation segment remained flat at $7,222 million. Transportation revenues declined 20% year over year to $993 million on lower equipment volume.Power segment revenue was down 15% year over year to $9,421 million with lower demand for turbines, while revenues from the Healthcare segment improved 6% to $5,402 million due to solid volume and cost productivity. Revenues from the Renewable Energy segment were up 15% year over year to $2,875 million largely due to higher services revenue. Revenues from the GE Capital segment decreased 42% year over year to $1,545 million.Margins, Balance Sheet and Cash FlowDespite stringent cost-cutting and simplification initiatives, General Electric recorded lower margins in the reported quarter due to headwinds in the Power and Transportation segments. Industrial segment operating profit decreased 39% year over year to $3,542 million, with a decline in profits in Power (down 88%) and Transportation (down 40%), partially offset by a significant rise in profits in Renewable Energy (up 25%) and Healthcare (up 13%).GE Power is the largest business segment of the company in terms of corporate revenues. However, the business has been a drag on earnings in the last few quarters as global demand waned with increasing popularity of renewable energy sources, overcapacity, lower utilization and fewer outages. Industry experts opine that the acquisition of Alstom’s assets for $10 billion in 2015 further compounded the problems for General Electric, as it increased the employee count by approximately 65,000 with the addition of several field offices and manufacturing sites across the world. This led to higher operating costs and contracted margins.General Electric recorded total segment loss of $3,028 million compared with profit of $6,057 million in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin for the Industrial segment declined to 11.2% from 16.8% in the prior-year period.  Cash generated from operating industrial activities for the quarter (excluding deal taxes and pension plan) totaled $7,757 million, down 6% year over year. Cash and marketable securities at year-end 2017 aggregated $82 billion compared with $92.4 billion in the year-ago period.OutlookGeneral Electric offered its guidance for 2018. The company currently anticipates operating earnings to be within $1.00–$1.07, with growth momentum in Aviation and Healthcare and continued challenges in the Power segment. The company expects a gradual improvement in earnings with structural changes, simplification and cost-cutting initiatives.General Electric currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

1061,UTX,"United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) provides high-end technology products and services to the building systems and aerospace industries worldwide. It has a diversified business mix and wide geographical presence to mitigate operating risk. The business mix and diversification allows the company to remain profitable even during tough economic times, delivering consistent earnings and dividend growth.The company is susceptible to high operating risks following the Brexit referendum, as it has a huge operating exposure in the U.K. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and macroeconomic turbulences also affect the stability of the company’s cash flows. This limits the visibility regarding the company’s future performance. With the extent of competition increasing over time, investors have been eagerly awaiting the company’s latest earnings report.UTX has some outstanding earnings track record, and has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 3.5% in the last four trailing quarters.

1062,UTX,"The earnings season is off to a brisk start with about 81 S&P 500 companies reporting this week. About 53 S&P 500 members have already released their results till Jan 19. Total earnings for these companies are up 11.7% year over year on 7.5% higher revenues, with 81.1% beating earnings estimates and 75.5% surpassing top-line expectations. Based on the hitherto observed pattern, the fourth quarter is anticipated to register modest double-digit percentage earnings growth on a year-over-year basis. Per the latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for all the S&P 500 are expected to be up 10.3% on 7.1% growth in revenues. This represents an improved growth projection from the previous quarter driven by a corporate tax overhaul and relatively healthy job data, which in turn boosted corporate earnings, stoked investments and trickled down to employees in some instances. Experts widely believe that earnings growth is likely to improve steadily in 2018 and beyond.The Conglomerates sector appears to be a drag on the overall earnings. For the sector, earnings are expected to decline 16.6% year over year while sales are touted to rise 2.9% due to a likely disappointing performance by one of the leading players in the industry.Let’s take a sneak peek at two major Conglomerate stocks scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings tomorrow to see how things are shaping up for the upcoming results.General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report results before the opening bell. The company is likely to report lower industrial segment profit in the quarter owing to higher operating costs and $6.2 billion charges from the legacy insurance business. This has severely impaired CEO John Flannery’s plans to script a turnaround in the company, with 2018 being termed as a “reset year”. Flannery had earlier disclosed his plans to focus on just three core segments — power, aviation and health-care equipment — and gradually exit all other businesses to plug the downtrend. The company is now seriously contemplating to spin off its operations to maximize shareholder returns. (Read more: Will Lower Industrial Segment Profit Hurt GE's Q4 Earnings?)In the fourth quarter, the company’s earnings are expected to fall 39% year over year on 4.3% lower revenues. For the impending quarter, the company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, and Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), making an earnings surprise prediction uncertain. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for a likely earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.General Electric Company Price and EPS Surprise  General Electric Company Price and EPS Surprise | General Electric Company QuoteUnited Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report results before the opening bell as well. The company is likely to report higher revenues in the impending quarter owing to a favorable macroeconomic environment. Revenues are largely affected by spending in the U.S. military and commercial aviation industries. An increase in demand for the company’s products in these industries is likely to favorably impact its financial performance in the quarter. The strong aftermarket business that sells spare parts and offers related services to keep the primary products running is also likely to record a healthy growth momentum with uptick in the economy. Furthermore, continued focus on four key priorities to fuel its growth momentum, namely flawless execution, innovation for growth, structural cost reduction and disciplined capital allocation is likely to translate to improved performance in the quarter. We remain inconclusive on earnings beat prediction this quarter as it has an ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #2.

He said, “Whether or not it happens, you'll be knowing pretty soon.” Trump and Kin Jong Un are scheduled to meet in Singapore on June 12.

1064,UTX,"On Monday, shares of Orbital ATK  are soaring, up over 20% in morning trading after it was announced that defense giant Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) would be buying the company for $7.8 billion in cash while assuming $1.4 billion in debt. NOC stock is up about 1.5% in morning trading as well.Orbital shareholders are set to receive $134.50 per share, which represents a 22% premium to its Friday close of $110.04. Orbital has made a name for itself designing and manufacturing space, defense, and aviation-related systems, in particular rocket motors that power missiles and target launch vehicles that are used during missile defense systems tests.“The acquisition of Orbital ATK is an exciting strategic step as we continue to invest for profitable growth,” said Wes Bush, Northrop’s chief executive, in a statement. “Through our combination, customers will benefit from expanded capabilities, accelerated innovation and greater competition in critical global security domains.”Northrop has one of the largest footprints in the defense industry today, and is one of the Pentagon’s leading suppliers. Along with rival Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), the company is working with the Air Force on the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent program, designing a new intercontinental ballistic missile system. And, Northrop won a highly-coveted contract to develop the B-21 stealth bomber.With Orbital, Northrop’s presence could grow even bigger. Along with its missile designs, Orbital holds a contract with NASA to resupply the International Space Station with its Antares rocket. According to The LA Times, the company has also developed a rocket called the Pegasus that can be attached to its Stargazer L-1011 airplane, as well as the still-in-development Next Generation Launcher (NGL), which Orbital hopes to get certified by the U.S. Air Force.The Northrop-Orbital acquisition, which is subject to regulatory approval, is expected to close in the first half of 2018. And after the deal closes, Orbital will operate as its own business segment within Northrop, at least at first, said Mr. Bush.As a whole, the defense industry has undergone some major changes recently, and this deal comes soon after another huge acquisition: United Technologies’ (UTX  -  Free Report) $30 billion purchase of Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report). However, defense stocks are responding positively, with the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA  -  Free Report) having risen over 21% so far this year.New Report: An Investor’s Guide to CybersecurityCyberattacks have become more frequent and destructive than ever.

1065,UTX,"Markets closed mostly lower on Thursday after Core CPI data came in above expectations, increasing the overall rate of inflation to just below the Fed’s target rate. This raised speculations regarding a possible rate hike in the near future and weighed on the markets. Meanwhile, Dow gained for the third successive session and registered its 38th record close on Thursday. The S&P 500 declined after the retail shares tanked. In a series of latest threat, North Korea threatened to raze both Japan and the United States with nuclear weapons after the U.N. issued fresh sanctions against the country.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 22,203.48, gaining 0.2%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) decreased 0.1% to close at 2,495.62. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,454.28, declining 0.1%. A total of 6 billion shares were traded on Thursday, higher than the last 20-session average of 5.8 billion shares. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1.09-to-1 ratio.  On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by a 1.20-to-1 ratio.  The CBOE VIX increased 1.3% to close at 92.09.Dow Hits Another Record, Broader Markets End LowerThe Dow gained 45.30 points on Thursday to register its 38th record close for 2017. Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report) contributed to most of the gains for the blue-chip index, rising 1.4% and 2.6% respectively. Shares of Boeing gained after the company announced plans to expand production of its 787 Dreamliner jets to 14 units in a month by 2019. Boeing possesses a Zacks Rank#2 (Buy), whereas United Technologies possesses a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 dropped almost 3 points to end lower after the consumer discretionary shares tanked. Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, five ended in the red, with consumer discretionary shares leading the decliners. The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLY) was down 0.54%. Such losses were incurred due to a slump in the shares of retail stocks. Shares of Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report) and Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) declined 4.8% and 2.2% respectively, weighing heavily on the S&P 500.An Uptick in Inflation Raises Expectations of a Rate Hike by FedThe Core CPI surged 0.4% for the month of August as compared to the consensus estimate of 0.3% increase for the same period. High rents and surging gas prices increased the cost of living in the United States in August. Gasoline prices surged last month as an aftermath of Hurricane Harvey and the economists do not expect the prices to go down anytime soon.Moreover, the shelter index –– an index for measuring the cost of shelter –– swelled 0.5% in August, posting its biggest monthly increase since 2005. Economists commented that such an increase was the result of surging housing costs in the United States. Moreover, the core index rose 0.2% for the same period, logging its highest increase in six months.Such high increase in the cost of living bolstered the rate of inflation to 1.9%, up from 1.7%. This resulted in speculations regarding a possible rate hike by the Fed as the figures for inflation came in just below the desired 2%. Such speculations caused broad based losses for the market.Meanwhile, the cost of medical care decreased in August. The cost of medical care gained a paltry 1.8% in the last 12 months, also marking its smallest gain since 1965. Economists believe such a low rate of growth can be owed to declining payouts to doctors. Moreover, the uncertainty about the future of Obamacare also contributed toward the retarding growth rate of medical care costs.Fresh Threats Surface from North KoreaIn the latest rhetoric, North Korea issued fresh threats to both Japan and the United States on Thursday in the wake of new sanctions by the UN on the Asian country. In a clear-cut statement, North Korea vowed to raze both Japan and United States with nuclear weapons. Geopolitical tensions between Pyongyang and Washington have escalated in the past after the Asian country tested a series of its nuclear missiles, one of them flying over Japan’s Hokkaido.Trump Agrees With the Democrats Once AgainOn Wednesday night, top leaders from the Democratic Party stated that they had reached an agreement with President Trump to protect the children of illegal immigrant in the United States.

1066,UTX,"Geopolitical risks have been rising as North Korea refuses to stop its threats. Moreover, with countries expanding their weapons system, defense stocks have been rallying lately.Is North Korea Driving Defense ETFs?On Sep 3, North Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test of a hydrogen bomb, which can be mounted on an intercontinental ballistic missile. Kim Jong-Un’s actions have created quite a stir in the United States and a number of Asian economies (read: Safe Haven Currency ETFs Gain, Dollar Loses Amid Geopolitical Uncertainty).Per a Bloomberg article, the state-run Korean Central News Agency citing a statement by the Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee said on Thursday, “Japan is no longer needed to exist near us.” The statement further added, “The four islands of the archipelago should be sunken into the sea by the nuclear bomb of Juche”.Han Tae Song, North Korea's ambassador to the UN, told a UN conference, ""The forthcoming measures by DPRK (the Democratic Republic of Korea) will make the US suffer the greatest pain it has ever experienced in its history.""These threats come as UN passed new sanctions on North Korea. The sanctions are aimed at starving North Korea of oil to run its nuclear program by reducing oil imports by the country. Although the United States aimed at total oil embargo on North Korea, sanctions were watered down in order to secure China and Russia’s support, as they held veto power on the decision.North Korea has received repeated warnings from the United States, that if it does not stop its nuclear tests, it will have to face significant military response. As a result, major nations have started focusing on their defense systems in order to prepare for any mishap.Strong FundamentalsThe earnings performance for the sector has been impressive in the second quarter and is expected to continue in the third quarter as well.

1067,UTX,"United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) division, Pratt & Whitney and its business partner Embraer, received Type Certification from three regulatory agencies — the Agência Nacional de Aviação Civil in Brazil, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the European Aviation Safety — for their new E190-E2 aircraft.The aircraft is exclusively powered by the Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbofan (GTF) engine and is scheduled to enter into service with Widerøe Airlines, a Nordic airline company, from April 2018. Given the level of complexity involved in the E2 program, receiving statutory clearances is a testament to the companies’ dedication, hard work and teamwork. With this, together they have achieved a significant milestone in the aerospace industry.   Pratt & Whitney is one of the world’s leading suppliers of aircraft engines for the commercial, military, business jet and general aviation markets. It provides high-end technology products and services to the aerospace industries worldwide. United Technologies’ revenue-generating potential and profitability are likely to improve with this latest development.  In addition, the company expects that the strategic moves will further ensure a successful entry and production ramp-up of its GFT engines to thwart intense competition from peers. Moreover, United Technologies also has a strong aftermarket business. The company not only manufactures and sells primary products such as aircraft engines and helicopters but also sells spare parts and offers related services to keep those primary products running. The company’s aftermarket services business is relatively stable compared to new product delivery and it helps offset the negative impact of downturns in the new products market.Moreover, United Technologies has restructured its aerospace unit. These included an overhaul of its organizational structure in the aerospace business along with some key changes in the leadership positions within it. United Technologies anticipates that the streamlined organizational set-up would enable it to better serve its employees, customers and suppliers.

1068,UTX,"President Donald Trump’s proposal of imposing tariff on imported steel and aluminum saw domestic steel stocks rally on Thursday. Although certain quarters feel that this might spark a trade war and disbalance the global economy, eventually affecting profits of exporters, the proposal has been cheered by U.S. steel and aluminum manufacturers.Domestic steelmakers see this move as Trump’s initiative to revive the steel and aluminum industry that has been declining over the last few decades. Tariff on imported steel and aluminum also makes manufacturers hopeful of more employment in the sector. So it obviously makes good sense now to add stocks from the sector to your portfolio.Domestic Steel Stocks Rally on Trump’s Announcement Trump announced on Mar 1 that he would impose hefty tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. An executive order on the proposed tariff of 25% on imported steel and 10% aluminum would be signed in the coming days. The President believes that such a move will help in rebuilding the U.S. steel and aluminum industry that has been treated unfairly by other countries for decades. The announcement may have sparked a debate on a possible trade war but it gave the share price of U.S. steelmakers a shot in the arm.Close on the heels of the announcement, shares of major steel manufacturers rallied. On Mar 1, shares of AK Steel Holding Corp (AKS  -  Free Report) rose 9.5% and U.S. Steel Corp (X  -  Free Report) jumped 5.8%. Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) and Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report) jumped 3.3% and 4.0%, respectively. Shares of aluminum producer Century Aluminum Company (CENX  -  Free Report) climbed 7.5%, while Alcoa Corp. (AA  -  Free Report) increased 1%.While the decision was well received by domestic steel manufacturers and lawmakers, it drew flak from other quarters that fear damage to the U.S. economy. The big fear among investors is that other countries might now take similar retaliatory steps, which will hurt the global economy and trade, eventually affecting profits of U.S. exporters.As a result, shares of manufacturers that utilize a significant amount of imported steel declined. Shares of major automakers, which were already suffering due to lower vehicle sales in February, declined further on the announcement. Shares of General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) fell 3.97%, while Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. (FCAU  -  Free Report) plunged 3% and 2.8%, respectively.Moreover, shares of heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) declined 2.9%. United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA) and 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) dropped 3.3%, 3.5% and 1.8%, respectively.Trump Keeps Key Campaign PromiseThe United States has been suffering from manufacturing employment decline for decades now. Before getting elected, Trump campaigned heavily on his America First trade policy. The proposed imposition of a respective 25% and 10% tariff on imported steel and aluminum is a big step in this direction.However, Trump hasn’t taken enough measures to implement that policy since taking office. His tariff announcement could mean that he is finally keeping is election campaign promise of reviving the steel and aluminum industry in the Rust Belt, that helped him win the 2016 election.Many of the workers form states in this area, who had voted for Barrack Obama, surprised the country by swinging toward Trump. However, Trump’s support in this area has been waning since then, and this announcement comes as a move to keep his promise and of course win back support before the 2020 election.Will Import Tariff Really Create Steel Jobs?Trump’s announcement comes with the objective of protecting the domestic steel and aluminum industry by increasing production, which will eventually help in creating more jobs. Trump has constantly been stressing on the need to save these industries, which he feels were not treated fairly by other countries. U.S. steelmakers lost three fourth of their jobs between 1962 and 2005.However, a study by American Economic Associations shows that this has been primarily because of improved production technology. Most steelmakers over the last few decades have increased the level of automation on their production lines, which has increased the output per worker to five times, consequently taking a toll on workforce. Hence analysts believe that despite this announcement, the impact on employment may be far less than what one hopes.Our ChoicesTrump’s America First policy has made domestic steelmakers optimistic about the future of the industry. Such a move hints at increasing domestic steel and aluminum production, which is expected to result in higher employment. Moreover, Trump’s announcement saw shares of domestic steel and aluminum makers rally immediately.Adding domestic steel stocks to your portfolio looks like a smart option at this point. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.United States Steel Corporation is an integrated steel producer with major production operations in the United States and Central Europe. United States Steel Corporation has expected earnings growth of more than 100% for the current year.

1069,UTX,"General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 20, before the opening bell. The company’s Aviation segment is likely to report lower profit in the quarter, thanks to challenging market conditions.Modest Q4 PerformanceIn fourth-quarter 2017, GE Aviation revenues were flat year over year at $7,222 million, as Equipment revenues (which declined 6% on fewer legacy engine shipments) offset higher LEAP engine shipments. Services revenues improved 6% on higher commercial spares and military.Orders rose 11% to $8 billion, driven by Equipment and Services. Equipment orders rose 2% year over year, while service orders grew 17% (driven by higher commercial spares business).Operating profit of $1,786 million was up 2% primarily driven by favorable volume and mix, cost productivity and value gap, partially offset by margin pressure from higher LEAP shipments. Operating margin expanded 40 basis points (bps) to 24.7%.Accounting for 23% of total revenues in fourth-quarter 2017, Aviation forms an integral part of GE as CEO John Flannery intends to focus on three core segments — Power, Aviation and Healthcare. He aims to gradually exit all other businesses to plug the downtrend in its shares.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Aviation revenues in fourth-quarter 2017 was pegged at $7,091 million compared with $6,804 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Operating profit for the segment was expected at $1,352 million, down from $1,684 million in the prior-year quarter. The downside was caused by pressure from higher LEAP shipments.Overall Q1 ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for theIndustrial segment profit in the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at $2,660 million, reflecting a decline of 26.6% from the year-ago quarter’s figure of $3,622 million. Total revenues for the industrial segment are likely to decline to $26,425 million sequentially, from $32,214 million in fourth-quarter 2017.The company is likely to report lower industrial segment profit in the quarter, thanks to higher operating costs. GE’s fourth-quarter earnings are likely to be hit by high overall expenses with the Zacks Consensus Estimate being pegged at 11 cents. (Read more: Weak Power & Transportation Margins to Hurt GE's Q1 Earnings)Moving ForwardFlannery has termed 2018 as a ‘reset year’ and is contemplating to spin off its operations to maximize shareholder returns. In addition, GE aims to reduce overhead costs by $2 billion in 2018, majority of which is likely to come from the power segment that sells electrical generation equipment. The company intends to sell assets worth $20 billion to improve liquidity.Amid such drastic portfolio restructuring initiatives, management decided to continue with its inclination for the Aviation segment, which is one of the three core segments.Other stocks from the industry that are likely to report their first-quarter 2018 earnings include 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report), Honeywell International Inc.

1071,UTX,"Diversified conglomerate, United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jan 24. The company is likely to report higher revenues in the impending quarter owing to a favorable macroeconomic environment.Whether this can translate to bottom line growth of the company remains to be seen.Top-Line GrowthRevenues of the company are largely affected by spending in the U.S. military and commercial aviation industries. An increase in demand for the company’s products in these industries is likely to favorably impact its financial performance in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of fourth quarter of 2017 for United Technologies is $15,400 million, significantly higher than reported revenues of $14,659 million in the prior-year quarter. Revenues across Otis, Pratt & Whitney and Aerospace Systems segments are expected to increase year over year to $3,112 million, $4,157 million and $3,858 million, respectively from $3,063 million, $3,992 million and $3,598 million.  In September 2017, United Technologies announced its plans to acquire Rockwell Collins, an Iowa-based avionics firm. Post the acquisition, United Technologies is expected to emerge as one of the world’s largest aircraft equipment manufacturers. The acquisition, slated to be completed by the third quarter of 2018, will provide a huge competitive advantage to the company and increase its bargaining power. The resultant operating synergies and lower operating costs will help it create complementary products that will help it serve evolving global customer needs.The merger is expected to be a huge boost to the company’s revenues and adjusted earnings per share after the first full year of combined operations with synergies to the tune of more than $500 million. Although the transaction will not have any direct impact on the earnings in the quarter, it is likely to attract similar lucrative deals for the company that in turn could augment overall revenues in the quarter.Other Key FactorsThe strong aftermarket business that sells spare parts and offers related services to keep the primary products running is also likely to record a healthy growth momentum with uptick in the economy. Furthermore, continued focus on four key priorities to fuel its growth momentum, namely flawless execution, innovation for growth, structural cost reduction and disciplined capital allocation is likely to translate to improved performance in the quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that United Technologies is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components.

1073,UTX,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business segment has secured a modification contract to upgrade F-35 Lightning II aircraft. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by June 2021.Valued at $20 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland. Per the deal, the company will deliver additional radar upgrades for the Block 3F software integrated in the F-35 jets.Notably, the project includes 58% of the work for the U.S. Air Force and 42% for Marine Corps. Fiscal 2016 aircraft procurement (Air Force and Marine Corps) will be utilized to complete the task at Fort Worth, TX.F-35 AttributesLockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is a single-seat, single-engine 5th Generation fighter aircraft, which comes with an advanced stealth feature combined with enhanced fighter speed and agility, fully-fused sensor information, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment. Currently, three variants of F-35 are set to replace five fighter jets for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps as well as a variety of fighter jets for at least 10 other countries.With Lockheed Martin being the primary partner, the F-35 program has been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors. Notably, Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) rendered its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology to this program, BAE Systems’ (BAESY  -  Free Report) short takeoff and vertical landing experience, and air systems sustainment supported the jet’s combat capabilities. Also, Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report), provided F-35s with the F135 propulsion system — the world's most powerful fighter engine.Recent DevelopmentsThe F-35 program is Lockheed Martin’s largest program, which generated 24% of its total net sales in first quarter of 2018. As of May 14, 2018, the company delivered more than 290 F-35 jets to the United States and its allies.However, critics have condemned this program as the costliest military program for the U.S. government. It was only after President Trump’s intervention, in February 2017, that Lockheed Martin ultimately announced its decision to cut down F-35’s cost significantly.Now, the company’s current cost-saving initiative to lower sustainment costs for F-35 project is expected to result in cost savings of $1 billion over a five-year period. In sync with this, per a recent report by Lockheed Martin, it targets to reduce the cost of an F-35A to $80 million by 2020, with production enhancements.Also, additional improvements implemented in these planes like the software upgrades, which were a part of this latest contract, will allow the company to further reduce the cost of this program. Moreover, with the U.S. government’s current inventory objective of 2,456 F-35 aircraft coupled with its reduced price we may expect to witness a continued ramp up in the production of these jets, in coming days. No doubt, Lockheed Martin enjoys a solid growth prospect for F-35 program, which in turn, will surely boost its profit margin.Price MovementIn a year’s time, shares of Lockheed Martin have rallied about 13.2% compared with the broader industry’s increase of 38.4%. The underperformance was most probably caused by the intense competition that the company faces domestically as well as internationally. Zacks Rank Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1075,UTX,"We should have known something big was coming when General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) slashed its dividend in half last November, and now, it looks like the industrial and infrastructure giant is mulling a restructuring move that would break up the company.The speculation began when GE announced that it will be taking an after-tax GAAP charge of $6.2 billion to its fourth quarter earnings—at the new 21% tax rate, the charge will be $7.5 billion—a significant hit that is linked to weakness in the company’s North American Life & Health insurance portfolio.This is a shining example of the difficulties GE and other long-term care insurers and re-insurers have faced over the years. Because of the rise in healthcare costs, and the simple fact that people are living longer, many insurers are struggling to “make good on policies dating back to the 1990s,” notes Reuters.GE also said that over the next seven years, it’s financing segment GE Capital would make $15 billion statutory reserve payment contributions to the long-term care insurance assets. But in order to fund this, the company will be suspending GE Capital’s dividend for the “foreseeable future.”In a conference call with analysts, CEO John Flannery said that “We are looking aggressively at the best structure or structures for our portfolio to maximize the potential of our businesses,” and a review “could result in many, many different permutations, including separately traded assets really in any one of our units, if that’s what made sense.”“Needless to say, at a time when we are moving forward as a company, I am deeply disappointed at the magnitude of the charge,” Flannery said on the call. “It’s especially frustrating to have this type of development when we’ve been making progress on many of our key objectives.”Not only is Flannery seemingly implying that a breakup for GE is on the horizon, but sources told CNBC’s David Faber that a split is “likely,” and could come as soon as this spring.Shares of GE closed the day down almost 3% to $18.21 per share.A Fading IconWhen Flannery took over from previous CEO Jeffrey Immelt last August, he had big plans for GE. He made a promise to consider all options for the company, and emphasized a business strategy that would concentrate on jet engines, health-care machines, and power-generation equipment.Fast forward to November, and you could see those plans beginning to come into focus, though some cost cutting and other major business decisions had to happen first. Besides its dividend cut, GE is planning over $2 billion in cuts this year, along with $20 billion in divestments over the next year or two.This could include the potential sale of oil and gas company Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report); GE just bought a majority stake in BHGE last year, and the consolidation of each respective company’s oil and gas businesses is going smoothly. GE previously sold its real estate portfolio, its water business, its unit that makes electrical equipment for utilities, its dishwasher and appliance business, and sold its media properties NBC and Universal Studios to Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report).Additionally, the company said that there will be “ongoing actions” to shrink GE Capital’s business over the next two years, continuing a plan set in motion back in 2015 to sell the majority of its finance division’s operations.Too Little Too Late?While its insurance arm has certainly been struggling, it’s just another problem in a long list of problems for GE.The company was the worst performer on the Dow in 2017, with shares losing almost 40% in value. Margins have been on the decline since 2014, and the company’s free cash flow has grown less and less consistent, especially after it decided to sell its very lucrative lending business.Chart via: ZacksSince its founding in 1892, GE grew into a business icon, creating a portfolio along the way that spanned everything from energy and infrastructure to finance and media. The company was once looked to as a reliable symbol of American success, and during the ‘80s and ‘90s, its management practices gained a huge following under then-CEO Jack Welch.Under Jeffrey Immelt, GE began to shrink, with a goal of focusing on businesses it could win in and getting rid of the ones that were distractions. But compared to other multinational rivals like Honeywell (HON  -  Free Report) and United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report), GE’s continued underperformance became even more glaring.What’s next for the company? If a breakup is on the docket, GE and its management must make sure that each of its core businesses are performing at the levels where they need to be, and that may be a tough thing to accomplish.But even if GE decides to split up, what’s the guarantee that the move will help the company bounce back? Flannery’s narrowed vision certainly has potential, and a fresh leader at the head of the table is never a bad thing for an older institution like GE. However, with a weakening brand name and strong growth competitors, a breakup may not be the easiest fix for GE after all.GE reports its fourth-quarter earnings on January 24.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1076,UTX,"United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) recently moved a step closer to completing the acquisition of Iowa-based avionics firm, Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report). The strategic transaction, expected to close by the third quarter of 2018, will likely create an industry behemoth with an unrivalled competitive advantage.Shareholder ApprovalYesterday, Rockwell Collins announced that more than 96% of the total votes casted for seeking the approval for the transaction, representing above 72% shareholders, voted in favor of the merger. Both the companies are presently awaiting other regulatory approvals and the fulfillment of other mandatory closing conditions.The MergerIn September last year, United Technologies inked a definitive agreement to acquire Rockwell Collins for $140 per share in a combination of cash and stock. Under the terms of the agreement, each Rockwell Collins shareholder is entitled to receive $93.33 per share in cash and the balance amount or $46.67 in United Technologies’ shares. This equates to a purchase price of $30 billion, including Rockwell Collins' net debt. United Technologies funded the transaction through secondary debt offering and available cash while maintaining solid investment grade credit ratings.Post completion, Rockwell Collins and United Technologies’ UTC Aerospace Systems division will be integrated to create a new business unit called Collins Aerospace Systems.Probable BenefitsThe acquisition is expected to offer United Technologies a bigger clout in the industry and increase its bargaining power as it would emerge as one of the largest aircraft equipment manufacturers. The combined company would be better suited to meet the evolving global customer needs.With complementary products, the combination is likely to yield operating synergies through lower operating costs and more opportunities to cross sell the products. United Technologies expects the merger to be accretive to adjusted earnings per share after the first full year of combined operations with synergies to the tune of more than $500 million.United Technologies has outperformed the industry in the last three months with an average return of 13.6% compared with a gain of 1.8% for the latter.Moving ForwardWith a bigger product portfolio, the company is likely to become an even more critical supplier of components to big aircraft manufacturers like The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Airbus SE (EADSY  -  Free Report). The consolidation of two industry heavyweights could further set off a wave of similar such deals across the defense industry.The acquisition is expected to boost United Technologies’ aerospace segment that has been struggling of late with severe delays in for supply orders in the Pratt & Whitney division.

1077,UTX,"Rockwell Collins Inc. (COL  -  Free Report) has been awarded a contract worth $22 million by the Defense Logistics Agency (“DLA”) to provide support for the Robins Air Force Base maintenance depot.This performance-based logistics (PBL) contract will be run for three years with Rockwell Collins and the company will be responsible for providing total supply chain management for replacing parts on the AN/ARC-171, AN/ARC-190 and AN/ARR-85 airborne communication product.Benefits to Air ForceThe PBL agreement is expected to bring enhanced alertness to the Air Force. This will be brought about by ensuring greater visibility to demand at the depot maintenance line. The contract will also result in reduced inventory and lower infrastructural costs. Further, value added logistics, engineering support as well as obsolescence management will be part of the company’s contract.What is Favoring Rockwell Collins?Widespread geo-political and socio-economic tensions have bolstered growth of the aerospace and defense industry for decades now. In recent times, escalating international terrorist attacks and emergence of civil wars have added impetus to the space. Impressively, stocks in the Zacks Aerospace sector have rallied 35% in the last 12 months, outperforming the S&P 500’s 23.8% gain.With a majority of macroeconomic factors favoring the sector, such outperformance can be expected to continue in the coming days.

1079,UTX,"On Dec 27, we issued an updated research report on industrial goods manufacturer, United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report).United Technologies serves various end markets such as aerospace, defense and commercial construction, which move according to their own cycles. This business mix and diversification allows the company to remain profitable even during tough economic times, delivering consistent earnings and dividend growth. United Technologies also has a strong aftermarket business. The company not only manufactures and sells primary products such as elevators, aircraft engines and helicopters but also sells spare parts and offers related services to keep the primary products running. The company’s aftermarket services business is relatively stable compared to new product delivery, and it helps offset the negative impact of downturns in the new products market.In order to fuel its growth momentum, the company remains focused on four key priorities — flawless execution, innovation for growth, structural cost reduction and disciplined capital allocation. United Technologies has also revamped its aerospace unit. These include an overhaul of its organizational structure in the aerospace business along with some key changes in the leadership positions within it. United Technologies anticipates that the streamlined organizational set-up would enable it to better serve its customers. In addition, the company expects that the strategic moves will further ensure a successful entry and production ramp-up of its Geared Turbofan engines to thwart intense competition from peers like General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report), Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) and Rolls Royce.With a diligent execution of operational plans, the company has outperformed the industry with an average year-to-date return of 16.4% against a decline of 4.5% for the latter. Moreover, the acquisition of Rockwell Collins is likely to create an industry behemoth with an unrivalled competitive advantage. The transaction is expected to offer United Technologies a bigger clout in the industry and increase its bargaining power as it would emerge as one of the largest aircraft equipment manufacturers in the world. The combined company would be better suited to meet the evolving global customer needs. With complementary products, the combination is likely to yield operating synergies through lower operating costs and more opportunities to cross sell the products. United Technologies expects the merger to be accretive to adjusted earnings per share after the first full year of combined operations with synergies to the tune of more than $500 million.Incorporating its improved expectations for organic sales growth in the near future, United Technologies raised its earlier guidance for 2017. Adjusted earnings are currently anticipated to lie within the $6.58-$6.63 per share range compared with the previously estimated range of $6.45-$6.60. Additionally, the company raised its revenue guidance for 2017 from $58.5-$59.5 billion to $59-$59.5 billion (estimating an organic growth of 3-4% year over year). Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment and continued investments in the aerospace segment, the company expects to generate significant cash from operations to reward shareholders with a risk-adjusted return through share repurchases and dividends.However, with more than 8,000 employees, United Technologies has a considerable presence in the U.K. Consequently, the company is susceptible to high operating risks following the Brexit referendum. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates also affect the company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause instability in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. Furthermore, United Technologies relies on suppliers, including third-party contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems. This exposes the company to market price volatility and availability risks. A disruption in deliveries from suppliers, capacity constraints, production disruptions, price changes, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities is likely to have an adverse effect on its ability to meet delivery schedules and thereby increase operating costs. These headwinds look all the more potent with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. A better-ranked stock in the industry is 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report), which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.3M has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 10.2%.

1080,UTX,"The U.S. aerospace and defense industry grabbed investors’ attention this week on the back of two significant developments. On Sep 5, defense stocks surged following North Korea’s ‘successful’ hydrogen bomb test — largest nuclear device test since 2006.The U.S. administration strongly condemned the act, wherein the U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis warned North Korea of dire consequences if the nation goes on encouraging such violent operations. This in turn boosted defense stocks on anticipation of escalated military actions from the United States.The finalization of the merger between United Technologies and Rockwell Collins however, dragged down defense stocks. The aerospace giant Boeing raised strong objections against the merger citing the deal’s potential to hinder competition in the aerospace supply chain market. This may have raised skepticism surrounding the deal.Meanwhile, keeping up with the trend, defense stocks continued to receive generous flow of funds from the Pentagon.Coming to the performance of the major indices of the Aerospace sector, in the last five trading sessions, the stocks ended up in the red zone. Notably, the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense (Industry) Index dropped 2.6%, while the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense Index dipped 2.3% during this period.Among last week’s highlights, defense primes Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. (HII  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Orbital ATK, Inc.  secured notable contracts from the Department of Defense (DoD). Moreover, Rockwell Collins Inc. (COL  -  Free Report) and United Technologies Corp. (UTX  -  Free Report) finalized their merger deal.(Read Defense Stock Roundup for Sep 1, 2017 here)A Look Back at Last Week’s Key Stories1.

The index rebounded on Wednesday after President Donald Trump concluded an agreement with Congress on the debt ceiling issue. However, losses for key components dragged the index lower on Thursday. Last Week’s PerformanceThe index gained 0.2% last Friday after market watchers played down chances of a possible rate hike by the Fed following desultory nonfarm payrolls data for August. A total of 156,000 jobs were added to the U.S. economy in August, significantly lower than the consensus estimate of 180,000 job additions.

Such losses were incurred after investors rotated out of relatively riskier assets due to escalating tensions between Pyongyang and Washington. The likelihood of the fallout of another hurricane named Irma over the coast of Florida sent home insurers lower.The index gained 0.3% on Wednesday after President Trump reached an agreement with key members of Congress to extend the debt ceiling deadline. This was done to aid the relief funding for victims of Hurricane Harvey. However, another category 5 Hurricane Irma gained momentum and is slated for land fall on the coast of Florida this weekend.

1082,UTX,"General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 20, before the opening bell. The company’s Healthcare segment is likely to report higher revenues and strong margins, owing to improved market dynamics and growth in medical diagnostics market.Impressive Q4 PerformanceIn fourth-quarter 2017, GE Healthcare’s revenues had jumped 6% year over year to $5,402 million, with orders improving 6% to $5.1 billion, driven by Healthcare Systems and Life Sciences businesses. Stable U.S. and European markets as well as strong growth in emerging markets boosted revenues. Renewables onshore contributed to growth despite significant price pressure in the industry.Orders for the segment increased 8% in the developed markets and 12% in emerging markets driven by strength in China. On a product basis, healthcare system orders were bolstered by higher demand for ultrasound and imaging products along with decent performance in mammography and CT. Order for life sciences products were driven by bioprocess and core imaging.Operating profit was up 13% to $1,159 million, driven by volume and productivity gains. However, the same was partially offset by price and program investments. Operating margin expanded 130 basis points (bps) to 21.5%.Accounting for 18.6% of total revenues in fourth-quarter 2017, Healthcare forms an integral part of GE as CEO John Flannery intends to focus on three core segments — Power, Aviation and Healthcare. He aims to gradually exit all other businesses to plug the downtrend in the company’s shares.In fact, earlier this month, GE inked an agreement to sell a trio of its health-care information technology businesses to private equity firm Veritas Capital for $1.05 billion in cash. The transaction includes GE’s Enterprise Financial Management, Ambulatory Care Management and Workforce Management software assets. This divestiture seems appropriate as the conglomerate has struggled to gain a dominant foothold in a crammed market for health-care workforce management and billing software, of late.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Healthcare revenues in first-quarter 2018 is currently pegged at $4,439 million, up from $4,291 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Operating profit for the segment is estimated at $686 million, up from $643 million reported in the prior year.Overall Q1 ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Industrial segment profit in the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at $2,660 million, reflecting a decline of 26.6% from the year-ago quarter’s figure of $3,622 million. Total revenues for the industrial segment are likely to be down sequentially to $26,425 million from $32,214 million in fourth-quarter 2017.The industrial goods manufacturer is likely to report lower industrial segment profit in the quarter owing to higher operating costs. GE’s first-quarter 2018 earnings are likely to be hit by high overall expenses with the Zacks Consensus Estimate pegged at 11 cents. (Read more: Weak Power & Transportation Margins to Hurt GE's Q1 Earnings)Moving ForwardFlannery has termed 2018 as a ‘reset year’ and is contemplating to spin off its operations to maximize shareholder returns. In addition, GE aims to reduce overhead costs by $2 billion in 2018, majority of which is likely to come from the power segment that sells electrical generation equipment. The company intends to sell assets worth $20 billion to improve liquidity.Amid such drastic portfolio restructuring initiatives, management decided to continue with its inclination for the Healthcare segment, which is one of the three core segments.Other stocks from the industry that are likely to report first-quarter 2018 earnings include 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report), Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) and United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report).Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this year, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

1083,UTX,"United Technologies Corporation’s (UTX  -  Free Report) operating segment, Pratt & Whitney, recently announced its decision to include five repair suppliers in its global network of providers that maintain the Geared Turbofan (GTF) engine. This, in turn, will support the PW1100G-JM engine.Notably, the new suppliers to join other GTF maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) providers across the globe include Turbine Controls, StandardAero, TWIN MRO, ACMT and Lewis & Saunders. These suppliers will join as the first third-party suppliers in the network of GTF engine repair providers. Currently, the GTF MRO network consists of Pratt & Whitney, MTU Aero Engines, Lufthansa Technik, Japanese Aero Engines Corporation and Delta TechOps.Earlier this week, Pratt & Whitney also announced that JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) has decided to power another 45 Airbus A320neo family aircrafts with its GTF engines. The decision follows a previous order of 40 GTF-powered A320neo family aircraft.Existing Business ScenarioExcessive reliance on suppliers, including third-party contract manufacturing and commodity markets, to secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems exposes United Technologies to market price volatility and availability risks. A disruption in deliveries from suppliers, capacity constraints, production disruptions, price changes, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities is likely to have an adverse impact on its ability to meet delivery schedules and thereby increase operating costs.Nevertheless, in the past six months, the company managed to outperform the industry. Shares of United Technologies have gained 3.1% against the industry’s decline of 12.5%.Moreover, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s financial performance depends on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries. While rise in interest rates may reduce residential construction in the United States, commodity inflation is expected to increase the price of raw materials thereby affecting the company’s margins. Also, market conditions in Carrier’s North American residential business appear challenging.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space include Federal Signal Corporation (FSS  -  Free Report) and Danaher Corporation (DHR  -  Free Report). While Federal Signal sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Danaher carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1084,UTX,"General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) inked a supply agreement with GreenTech Energy Company (a GE-authorized channel partners) to deliver 21 Jenbacher gas engines to be delivered by the end of 2018. This is one of GE’s biggest contracts for Jenbacher engines in the Russian market.The order includes 10 J320 units, 10 J420 units and a J316 unit — with a total capacity of 26 megawatts. Combined heat and power (CHP) units with single capacity ranging from 1 MW to 1.5 MW on the base of the engines will boost cleaner power generation, particularly around food and beverage, glass, agriculture and chemical processes industries.CHP can increase the efficiency of GE’s Jenbacher solutions to 90% or more, which is more than 40% greater than what can be achieved with thermal energy alone. These systems optimize the facilities of commercial and industrial businesses, municipalities and other energy-intensive institutions. These CHP solutions are space effective as well.GE Power is the biggest segment of the conglomerate in terms of corporate revenues. However, the unit has been a drag on earnings in the last few quarters, as global demand increasingly favours renewable energy sources. Also, overcapacity, lower utilization and fewer outages are other factors that are hurting demand. Nevertheless, In 2017, Flannery assured investors that energy, aviation and healthcare will continue to be the focal points of GE’s operations.It has been nearly five months since Flannery outlined his plan to divest more than $20 billion of assets.Earlier this month, GE inked an agreement to sell a trio of its health-care information technology businesses to private equity firm Veritas Capital for $1.05 billion. The deal marks one of the first notable portfolio-related moves since Flannery announced the plan to exit at least $20 billion of businesses. However, he has indicated at the possibility of the company’s disintegration into separately-traded businesses.The overhaul, coupled with cost cuts and cultural changes, encompass Flannery’s attempts to pull GE out of one of the deepest slumps in its 126-year history. The company’s shares have lost 42.9% in the past six months alone, wider than the industry’s decline of 11.6%.GE is not the only industrial giant which is contemplating a break up of its conglomerate structure. Per recent reports, United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) is considering a similar move. Recently, German player Siemens AG (SIEGY  -  Free Report) offloaded a part of its Healthineers medical imaging business through an IPO worth $5.2 billion.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderGeneral Electric carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the same space is Federal Signal Corporation (FSS  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1085,UTX,"On a whole, 2017 proved to be good year with the equity markets scripting some of their best performance. The benchmark S&P 500 index is up 20% year to date and is on the course to record its best performance in four years while Nasdaq has surged nearly 30%. Buoyed by a healthy economic growth and tax overhaul euphoria, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up an impressive 25% year to date and is close to hitting the historic figure of 25,000.However, not everything is perfect among the elite list of 30 stocks that comprise the Dow and the worst performing constituent among all the members happens to be the lone surviving component of the venerable blue-chip index that debuted in 1896. Industrial goods manufacturer General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) has tanked 45% year to date — the worst performance by a Dow constituent by a huge margin while its peers like 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) and United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) boast a return of 31.5% and 16.1%, respectively. (Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018? Be among the first to see our Top Ten Stocks for 2018 portfolio here.)What Ails GE?With about $27 billion revenues in 2016, GE Power was the largest business segment of the company in terms of corporate revenues. However, the business has been a drag on earnings in the last few quarters as global demand waned with increasing popularity of renewable energy sources, overcapacity, lower utilization and fewer outages. Industry experts opine that the acquisition of Alstom’s assets for $10 billion in 2015 further compounded the problems for GE, as it increased the employee count by approximately 65,000 with the addition of several field offices and manufacturing sites across the world. It seemed as if GE erred in its judgment about market demand and gambled on an industry that was on a decline.This led to higher operating costs and contracted margins. The Industrial segment’s operating profit decreased 7% year over year in third-quarter 2017 to $3,501 million, with a decline in profits in Power (down 51%), Oil & Gas (down 35%) and Transportation (down 11%). GE also missed on third-quarter earnings while cash from operating industrial activities (excluding deal taxes and pension plan) declined 40% year over year to $1,740 million.The Knee-Jerk ReactionsIn order to boost its sagging shares, CEO John Flannery has decided to focus on just three core segments — power, aviation and health-care equipment and gradually exit all other businesses. At the same time, the company halved its quarterly dividend to 12 cents per share — the first dividend cut since 2009 at the peak of the recession. For 2018, the dividend allocation will be $4.2 billion, down from more than 100% of free cash flow to 60-70% while the dividend yield will be trimmed from 4.7% to 2.3%. A healthy dividend yield was one of the strongest enticements for GE investors and the dramatic plunge in share prices are testament to the fact that shareholders have been very critical of the turnaround plan.For 2017, the company has also lowered its adjusted earnings guidance to $1.04-$1.12 per share from $1.60-$1.70. For 2018, GE expects adjusted earnings to be further down to $1.00-$1.07 per share and free cash flow at significantly reduced levels of $6 billion to $7 billion.The company intends to lay off 12,000 employees across the globe in its GE Power business, as part of its corporate objective to lower operating costs and improve profitability. The drastic step seems to be the call of the hour as the beleaguered company aims to restructure its power business in tune with the evolving market conditions. In addition, GE aims to reduce overhead costs by $2 billion in 2018, majority of which is likely to come from the beleaguered power segment that sells electrical generation equipment. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) firm further intends to sell assets worth $20 billion to improve its liquidity.

Critics, however, have widely raised concerns about the efficacy of such steps. Although the dividend cut was expected, the proposed exits from other businesses surprised the investor community, who argued how a much smaller and more focused GE could actually be beneficial with lower revenue-generating opportunities. Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets observed, “The company’s turnaround will now be more protracted than previously anticipated.”The drastic fall in share prices has mostly strengthened this opinion. Although some optimists would like to view this scenario as glass being half full rather being half empty, investors should rather remain cautious and weigh in their options for future.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1086,UTX,"Shares of industrial goods manufacturer United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) scaled a new 52-week high of $126.44 during Friday’s trading session, before closing a tad lower at $126.17 for a healthy year-to-date return of 16.5%. Barring minor hiccups, United Technologies’ share price has steadily been on an uptrend since mid-September.Despite its strong price appreciation, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has the potential to continue its upward trend with long-term earnings growth expectation of 8.4%.Growth DriversUnited Technologies serves various end markets such as aerospace, defense and commercial construction, that move according to their own cycles. This business mix and diversification allow the company to remain profitable even during tough economic times.In addition, United Technologies has a strong aftermarket business. The company not only manufactures and sells primary products such as elevators, aircraft engines and helicopters but also sells spare parts and offers related services to keep those primary products running.The company’s aftermarket services business is relatively stable compared to new product delivery. It further helps offset the negative impact of downturns in the new products market. With a diligent execution of operational plans, the company has outperformed the industry with an average year-to-date return of 15.1% against a decline of 4% for the latter.United Technologies has also revamped its aerospace unit. This included an overhaul of its organizational structure in the aerospace business along with some key changes in the leadership positions within it. United Technologies anticipates that the streamlined organizational setup would enable it to better serve its customers. In addition, the company expects that the strategic moves will further ensure a successful entry and production ramp-up of its Geared Turbofan engines to thwart intense competition from other players in the market.Incorporating its improved expectations for organic sales growth in the near future, management has raised its guidance for 2017. Adjusted earnings are currently anticipated to lie within the $6.58-$6.63 per share range compared with the previously estimated range of $6.45-$6.60.  Additionally, the company raised its revenue guidance for 2017 from the previous projection of $58.5-$59.5 billion to $59-$59.5 billion (estimating an organic growth of 3-4% year over year). Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment and continued investments in the aerospace segment, the company expects to generate significant cash from operations to reward the shareholders with a risk-adjusted return through share repurchases and dividends. This represents improving business conditions and strong operating fundamentals of the company.All these measures for a healthy near-term growth probably raised investor confidence and drove the shares to a 52-week high.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the industry are Danaher Corp. (DHR  -  Free Report), 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) and Leucadia National Corp. , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1087,UTX,"Northrop Grumman Corporation’s (NOC  -  Free Report) pending acquisition of Orbital ATK  finally got the approval from the latter’s shareholders on 29th Nov. Earlier, in September, the two defense majors inked a take-over deal worth $9.2 billion, by which Northrop Grumman agreed to buy  Orbital ATK by the first half of 2018.Notably, shareholders of Orbital ATK holding over 99% of common stock present at the meeting or represented by proxy, voted in favor of this merger agreement. This, in turn, represents 79% of the total number of outstanding shares of Orbital ATK’s common stock as of Oct 10, 2017.Benefits of the AcquisitionNorthrop Grumman continues to enjoy strong presence in Air Force, Space & Cyber Security programs. The company’s product innovation and focus on strengthening its ISR wing is anticipated to help maintain a stable earnings stream, amid rapidly changing requirements of the defense landscape.With the Orbital ATK buyout, Northrop Grumman is expected to benefit from the former's rocket motors, missiles and electro-optical countermeasure product lines. According to Wes Bush — chairman, chief executive officer and president of Northrop Grumman — the merger will offer increased competition, greater innovation and a broader set of capabilities that would aid its customers in solving their toughest challenges.Furthermore, Orbital ATK’s knowledge and expertise in satellites, spacecraft components and commercial space launch system will expand Northrop Grumman’s product offering, thereby providing tough competition to the existing defense companies.Per Orbital ATK’s 2016 financials, the company's contracts with the NASA and the U.S. Army is expected to boost Northrop Grumman’s product portfolio and rake in more than $4.4 billion, in the form of annual revenues.Earlier while announcing the deal Northrop Grumman had said that post merger this new business unit will be accretive to its earnings per share and free cash flow per share, in the second half of 2018.Also, the merger will be accretive to Northrop Grumman’s earnings per share and free cash flow in the first year of acquisition and lead to annual cost savings of nearly $150 million by 2020.Incidentally, President Trump has requested to increase fiscal 2018 defense spending by 10% from the present level. Considering this, we expect the combined company to hold a larger portion of the U.S. Defense order through its diverse product portfolio.Another Mega Deal in the SpaceExpansion through acquisition is not new in the defense industry. In September, United Technologies Corp. (UTX  -  Free Report) finalized the deal to acquire Rockwell Collins Inc. (COL  -  Free Report) for $30 billion. The deal is projected to be concluded by the third quarter of 2018, depending on consents from Rockwell Collins’ shareowners and other customary closing conditions including the receipt of required regulatory approvals.Price MovementFollowing Northrop Grumman’s announcement of Orbital ATK acquisition, shares of the former company have rallied 11.1% compared with the industry’s gain of 5.5%. This outperformance reflects that news of this acquisition has received positive response from the market.Zacks RankNorthrop Grumman carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1088,UTX,"Pratt & Whitney, one of the operating segments of diversified conglomerate United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), recently announced that its PurePower Geared Turbofan engines will be used by Vietnam Airlines, the flag carrier of Vietnam. The engines will power 20 Airbus A321neo aircraft of the airline that are widely known for their superior performance.The PurePower engine family has proven its mettle in the industry. It has a state-of-the-art gear system, which separates the engine fan from compressor and turbine, thereby facilitating an optimum operating speed for each of the modules. While the fan rotates slower, the low-pressure compressor and turbine operate at a high speed, increasing engine efficiency and delivering significantly lower fuel consumption, lesser noise and lower emissions along with reduced maintenance costs.Pratt & Whitney had earlier secured the joint Type Certification from the Federal Aviation Administration and the European Aviation Safety Agency for its PurePower Geared Turbofan engine in Airbus A321neo aircraft. Such coveted accreditations and continued product improvements have enabled United Technologies to outperform the industry with an average year-to-date return of 7.8% as against a decline of 3.5% for the latter.The PurePower Geared Turbofan engine has been able to meet the strict quality standards relating to burn, noise and emissions to receive the accreditation. The PurePower GTF engine has the ability to reduce engine fuel consumption by 16%, regulating emissions and noise footprint by 50% and 75%, respectively. The engine is reportedly being used by 80 different customers across the globe.The technologically superior products create a competitive advantage for Pratt & Whitney and ensure a steady stream of revenues. The company is among the world’s leading suppliers of aircraft engines to the commercial, military, business jet and general aviation markets. Its Global Services provide maintenance, repair and overhaul services, including the sale of spare parts and fleet management services for large commercial engines.United Technologies presently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1089,UTX,"The Dow suffered a loss of more than 200 points on Tuesday to register its worst one-day drop since Aug 17, ending its four day winning streak. Such losses were incurred after investors rotated out of relatively riskier assets due to escalating tensions between Pyongyang and Washington. Likelihood of the fallout of another hurricane named Irma over the coast of Florida sent home insurers lower.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 21,987.56, declining 234.25 points or 1.1%. United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report) was the Dow’s biggest decliner after its shares tanked 5.7% following a deal with Rockwell Collins to purchase the latter for $30 billion. The S&P 500 Index (INX) dipped 0.8% to close at 2,457.85, ending a six day winning streak and recording its worst daily drop since Aug 17. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,375.57, decreasing 0.9%. Trade volumes remained lower on Tuesday due to Labor Day holiday.A total of 6.7 billion shares were traded on Tuesday, higher than the last 20-session average of 5.8 billion shares.  Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 2.34-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by a 2.14-to-1 ratio. The CBOE Volatility index (VIX) increased 21% to 12.23.Geopolitical Tensions Send Shivers Down the MarketsThe CBOE Volatility index (VIX), widely regarded as the fear guage in the market, briefly jumped more than 38% to 14 on Tuesday. This was because of the escalating geopolitical tensions between North Korea and the United States. Over the weekend, North Korea tested its most powerful nuclear bomb, raising geopolitical instability in the Korean Peninsula and between Pyongyang and Washington.The latest missile test resulted in North Korea earning flak from leaders in the U.S. The U.S. Secretary of Defense, Jim Mattis warned Pyongyang that it would have to face  “a massive military response” in case of it attacked the U.S. or any of its allies such as South Korea and Japan. “We have many military options and the President wanted to be briefed on each one of them,”  said Mattis on Sunday afternoon.Moreover, South Korea’s defense ministry announced that North Korea was preparing to launch another intercontinental ballistic missile. Major General Jang Kyung-soo, the acting deputy minister for national defense policy, South Korea, said there are indications that North Korea will launch another ICBM, which they would test around Sep 9, their Foundation Day. Such statements hurt investor sentiments.Investors Rotate Out of Financials into BondsThe S&P 500 suffered its worst daily drop since Aug 17 following a nosedive in shares o financials. Eight of the S&P 500’s 11 main sectors closed lower, with financials leading the decliners. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) lost 2.10%, suffering its worst decline since May. Such a decline was the result of investors moving out of stocks that would have benefitted from tax deregulations to safer havens such as bonds. Market watchers are increasingly losing faith on Trump Administration’s ability to push through the much awaited tax reforms. Moreover, the recent rhetoric between Pyongyang and Washington also led investors to rotate out of riskier assets.The rotation from financial shares into bonds led to the yield on 10-year Treasury notes falling to 2.07%, its lowest level since Nov 9, 2016. Shares of financial companies nosedived on Tuesday. Also weighing on treasury bonds were comments fromFederal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard. According to Brainard, the Fed should slow down the momentum of interest rate hikes in the face of relatively lower inflation rates which have not hit the target of 2% over the past five years. “In that case, it would be prudent to raise the federal funds rate more gradually,” she commented.Shares of JP Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), HSBC Holdings (HSBC  -  Free Report), Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) declined 2.4%, 3.2%, 1.7%, 1.7%, 2.1% and 3.6%.

1090,UTX,"The aerospace and defense sector has been on a rally since last year. This has primarily been due to President Donald Trump’s push to boost defense spending in the United States. Further, a steep reduction in corporate taxes late last year will prove to be instrumental in bolstering growth for the sector in 2018.Also, Trump’s fiscal 2019 budget plan beefs up spending on defense and military research by as much as $470 billion over the next two years. Under such circumstances, the space is poised to breach boundaries in 2018 as the momentum that the segment picked up in last one year will continue.Defense Rally to Continue The space has seen splendid growth over the last one year. This is evident from the rise that the three broader ETFs tracking the sector has experienced in a year. The iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF ITA, the SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF XAR and PowerShares Aerospace & Defense PPA have all surged 34.9%, 31.3% and 31.9%, respectively. Notably, all these ETFs have surpassed the S&P 500’s (.INX) performance in the same period where the broader index climbed 17.4%.Coming to the top players in the industry, we find a similar trend of growth with each of the stocks individually surpassing the S&P 500’s performance in a year’s time. Shares of Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), Orbital ATK, Inc. , General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report) and United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) have gained 43.2%, 45%, 43.6%, 19.6%, 34.9%, 46% and 20.4%, respectively. Both the companies possess a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Trump’s Defense Budget ProposalThere’s no denying the fact that Trump’s presidency has come as a boon for the U.S. defense space, which was grappling with the budget sequestration act implemented by the prior government. While the fiscal 2018 (FY18) defense budget reflecting a noble 10% hike from the FY16 level was a major forerunner for this sector’s growth at the beginning of 2017, the FY18 defense policy bill worth $700 billion that extensively surpassed Trump's budget request took stocks to new heights in the second half of the year.On Feb 12, the Pentagon unveiled its fiscal 2019 budget proposal outlined by the President, in a bid to rebuild the U.S. military into a more agile and lethal force globally. Notably, the budget proposal aims at spending $716 billion on national security.Of the total, $686.1 billion has been reserved as funding for the Pentagon, reflecting 5% real growth over the initial FY18 President’s budget and 10% real growth over the current Continuing Resolution (CR). The budget includes $617.1 billion as base budget, highlighting a 17.8% increase from the 2018 current CR level, and $69 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations.Moreover, in the wake of North Korea’s ballistic missile threats, the budget proposal includes an investment plan of $6 billion for varied missile programs. The budget requests for increased investment worth $10.5 billion on facilities, reflecting a 7% rise over the fiscal 2018 base budget request. The funds will be used for fortifying military infrastructure to increase force lethality and minimize the cost of maintaining unneeded capacity.More Mergers & Acquisitions in PipelineIn the second half of 2017, we have seen a wave of mergers between big aerospace and defense companies in a bid to fend off competition, restructure business models as well as expand core operations and product lines. United Technologies has agreed to take over Rockwell Collins for $30 billion, while Northrop Grumman is set to buy Orbital ATK for $9.2 billion.While the deal will make United Technologies one of the world's largest aircraft equipment manufacturers, Northrop Grumman’s product line will benefit from Orbital's rocket motors, missiles and electro-optical countermeasure equipment. Slated to wrap up in 2018, synergies from these mega deals are sure to benefit the sector.Trump’s zeal to fortify the U.S. military has only strengthened the defense sector’s fortunes. The space rallied throughout last year, breaking boundaries in the second half of 2017 in particular. Most importantly, a reduction in corporate taxes to 21% has opened up more avenues for investments. Such developments have paved way for a plethora of acquisitions in the defense and aerospace segment in 2018.On Feb 12, the day Trump presented his second annual federal budget proposal, General Dynamics announced plans to purchase CSRA Inc  in a bid to venture and gradually expand the government sector business.Commenting on the deal, General Dynamics’ executive vice president of Information Systems & Technology Daniel Johnson stated that the company has an expanding budget and the analysts within the company believe that the services sector would spring back to pre-2011 conditions when the space was in its prime. This has encouraged the company to invest more on such ventures.Moreover, major defense contractors can expect a slew of contracts from the Pentagon. On the first day of 2018, Raytheon won a deal worth $333.4 million and Boeing secured a $193.6-million contract. With more such contracts anticipated, we expect major defense stocks to maintain the rally in 2018.U.S. Leads Global Defense ExportsEmerging nations like Japan and India as well as European countries are raising their defense budgets on account of the widespread geo-political uncertainties. As the United States is the largest supplier of defense equipment, it is without doubt a golden era for Aerospace & Defense stocks.According to the latest report from Aerospace Industries Association, United States led the global exports in the aerospace and defense segment in 2017. The country accounted for 34% of the total industry export. Further, U.S. Department of Commerce, the defense segment generated an astounding $143 billion from exports alone.Also, per the report from Aerospace Industries Association, China maintained the top spot as the largest importer of defense products from the U.S., accounting for a total of $16.3 billion worth of goods. Further, France and United Kingdom came in as the second and third, purchasing goods worth $12.9 billion and $10 billion, respectively.To ConcludeThe U.S. defense sector started off 2018 on solid note and is poised to witness stupendous growth in the days to come with a massive defense budget, steep reduction in corporate taxes and a plethora of merger deals and acquisitions lined up for 2018. Its recognition as the largest exporter of defense products in the world is another feather in its cap.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

1092,UTX,"We’ve already got a busy day of Q3 earnings reports to sift through, and market participants should take heart that, by and large, most major companies reporting before the opening bell have outperformed expectations — in some cases by a wide margin. After today’s market close, we expect another wave of Q3 reports from companies such as AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report). But let’s dig in with the breakfast portion of earnings results:Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) is up 7% in pre-market trading following its blowout results in Q3 earnings and revenues. Its bottom line of $1.77 per share amounts to a 45% positive earnings surprise over the $1.22 in the Zacks consensus, and miles ahead of the 85 cents per share in CAT’s fiscal Q3 2016. Sales reached $11.4 billion, far surpassing the $10.6 billion expected and $9.2 billion a year ago. Construction growth in China and on-shore oil & gas businesses in North America drove quarterly growth most notably.Remarkably, CAT’s 45% earnings surprise is roughly in-line with the heavy machinery manufacturer’s trailing four quarters of earnings beats, bolstered by a Q1 2017 surprise of more than 100%. Caterpillar has also upped full-year guidance to around $6.25 per share; $5.26 was the previous Zacks consensus estimate. CAT also carries a Zacks Style Score of A.General Motors (GM  -  Free Report) also outperformed expectations this morning: its $1.32 per share easily outperformed the $1.07 expected — though results are still down more than 20% year over year — on quarterly sales of $33.62 billion — well beyond the $31.6 billion we had been looking for. GM looks to bring two electric cars to market in the next year and a half. It also has posted a positive earnings surprise for at least the past five straight quarters, with a trailing 4-quarter average of 14.7%. Shares of GM are up 3% at this point in today’s pre-market.Defense and aerospace major United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report) topped expectations on earnings, revenues and guidance. This is the third straight earnings beat for the parent company of Pratt & Whitney, Otis Elevators, and many other companies: $1.73 per share beat the Zacks consensus by 5 cents, whereas the top-line actual of $15.1 billion outperformed the $14.9 billion we had been looking for. Full-year guidance was also raised from $6.45 - 6.60 per share to $6.58 - 6.63.Industrial supply giant 3M (MMM  -  Free Report) also beat top and bottom-line estimates prior to Tuesday’s open, with earnings of $2.33 per share and revenues of $8.17 billion surprising the $2.21 per share and $7.91 billion expected.

1093,UTX,"Tuesday, October 24, 2017We’ve already got a busy day of Q3 earnings reports to sift through, and market participants should take heart that, by and large, most major companies reporting before the opening bell have outperformed expectations — in some cases by a wide margin. After today’s market close, we expect another wave of Q3 reports from companies such as AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report). But let’s dig in with the breakfast portion of earnings results:Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) is up 7% in pre-market trading following its blowout results in Q3 earnings and revenues. Its bottom line of $1.77 per share amounts to a 45% positive earnings surprise over the $1.22 in the Zacks consensus, and miles ahead of the 85 cents per share in CAT’s fiscal Q3 2016. Sales reached $11.4 billion, far surpassing the $10.6 billion expected and $9.2 billion a year ago. Construction growth in China and on-shore oil & gas businesses in North America drove quarterly growth most notably.Remarkably, CAT’s 45% earnings surprise is roughly in-line with the heavy machinery manufacturer’s trailing four quarters of earnings beats, bolstered by a Q1 2017 surprise of more than 100%. Caterpillar has also upped full-year guidance to around $6.25 per share; $5.26 was the previous Zacks consensus estimate. CAT also carries a Zacks Style Score of A.General Motors (GM  -  Free Report) also outperformed expectations this morning: its $1.32 per share easily outperformed the $1.07 expected — though results are still down more than 20% year over year — on quarterly sales of $33.62 billion — well beyond the $31.6 billion we had been looking for. GM looks to bring two electric cars to market in the next year and a half. It also has posted a positive earnings surprise for at least the past five straight quarters, with a trailing 4-quarter average of 14.7%. Shares of GM are up 3% at this point in today’s pre-market.Defense and aerospace major United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report) topped expectations on earnings, revenues and guidance. This is the third straight earnings beat for the parent company of Pratt & Whitney, Otis Elevators, and many other companies: $1.73 per share beat the Zacks consensus by 5 cents, whereas the top-line actual of $15.1 billion outperformed the $14.9 billion we had been looking for. Full-year guidance was also raised from $6.45 - 6.60 per share to $6.58 - 6.63.Industrial supply giant 3M (MMM  -  Free Report) also beat top and bottom-line estimates prior to Tuesday’s open, with earnings of $2.33 per share and revenues of $8.17 billion surprising the $2.21 per share and $7.91 billion expected. Full-year guidance was also ratcheted up notably, from the previous Zacks consensus estimate of $8.95 per share to $9.00 - 9.15 as of its Q3 report. Shares of 3M are up 1.6% thus far in today’s pre-market.McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) posted a mixed Q3 earnings report this morning, beating earnings estimates by a penny to $1.76 per share on $5.76 billion, which was a bit shy of the $5.80 billion expected. The Zacks ESP called this one-cent beat exactly, even as the negative impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma hit same-store sales in Texas and Florida from Q3 2016. In fact, U.S. comps were up 4.1% in the quarter, and International was up 6%.

1096,UTX,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business division recently secured a delivery contract in relation to F-35 fighter jet. Work related to this deal is expected to be completed by February 2019.Details of the DealValued at $158.3 million, the deal was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland. Per the terms of the agreement, the company will offer program management, nonrecurring engineering, recurring engineering, site support and touch labor services to aid the modification and retrofit activities of the delivered air systems of the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter aircraft.The contract will cater to the Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy, non-Department of Defense (DoD) participant, and foreign military sales (“FMS”) customers.  The deal includes 48% of the work for the Air Force; 31% for the Marine Corps, 6% for the Navy, 11% for the non-DoD participants and 4% for international partners.Fiscal 2016 aircraft procurement, fiscal 2017 aircraft procurement, fiscal 2018 aircraft procurement, non-DoD participant and FMS funds will be utilized to complete the task at Fort Worth, TX.F-35 AttributesLockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is a single-seat, single-engine 5th Generation fighter aircraft, which comes with an advanced stealth feature combined with enhanced fighter speed and agility, fully fused sensor information, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment. Three variants of F-35 are set to replace five fighter jets for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps as well as a variety of fighter jets for at least 10 other countries.With Lockheed Martin being the primary partner, the F-35 program has been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors. Notably, Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) rendered its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology to this program, BAE Systems’ (BAESY  -  Free Report) short takeoff and vertical landing experience, and air systems sustainment supported the jet’s combat capabilities. Moreover, Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report), provides F-35s with the F135 propulsion system, which is the world's most powerful fighter engine.Recent DevelopmentsThe F-35 program is Lockheed Martin’s largest program, which generated 25% of its total net sales, as well as 64% of Aeronautics division’s net sales in 2017. Interestingly, this program has been repeatedly criticized by President Trump for being an overtly expensive project, in the recent past.To resolve this issue, the company inked an $8.5-billion deal with Pentagon in February 2017. Per the agreement, the company will deliver 90 F-35s of the 10th Lot at a historically low rate owing to Trump's intervention or to maintain management's earlier projection of cutting down cost by 6-7%. Over the next few years, the company is likely to adopt a cost-saving initiative to lower sustainment costs for F-35 by 10%. This, in turn, will result in cost savings of $1 billion over a five-year period. In fact, we believe the latest contract win will enable the company to take a step toward in achieving its goal and allow it to provide more of these combat aircraft at an efficiently reduced rate.Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin is enjoying steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon since reduction of its F-35 price. In July 2017, Lockheed Martin won a modification contract, worth $5.6 billion, to offer low-rate initial production of the 11th lot of F-35, while in August 2017 it won a contract worth $427million for procuring ancillary military equipment and pilot flight equipment for LRIP of the 11th Lot of F-35 jets.Production of F-35 is expected to continue for many years given the U.S. Government’s current inventory objective of 2,456  aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy; commitments from the company’s eight international partners and three international customers; as well as expressions of interest from other countries. Therefore, Lockheed Martin has solid growth prospect for F-35 program, which in turn will surely boost its profit margin.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1097,UTX,"The Dow traversed a difficult week, declining over three consecutive trading sessions. Investors remained concerned over the prospects of a trade war following President Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Trump’s decision to dismiss Secretary of State Rex Tillerson added to investors’ jitters. Ultimately, investors looking to pick up blue chip stocks on the dip helped the index finish in the green on Thursday.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow increased 1.8% on last Friday, moving past the 25,000 mark for the first time since Feb 28. Upbeat jobs data and lower wage growth subdued inflationary concerns and curbed rate hike fears. The U.S. economy added 313,000 jobs in February, exceeding the consensus estimate of 208,000 job additions. However, average hourly wages rose only 0.1% in February, lower than January’s 0.3% increase.The index gained 3.3% last week. President Trump signed his tariff plan into law per which fresh levies of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports will be imposed. However, the plan excludes countries like Canada and Mexico, offering Trump a chance to renegotiate terms of the NAFTA with the two countries. Also, the United States wants to discuss national security issues with both these countries.The Dow This WeekThe index declined 0.6% on Monday. Investors remained concerned about the prospects of a trade war following Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum. Fears of this nature dragged industrials lower during the session, a decline which weighed on the broader markets.Three Dow components from this sector, United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) declined 1.9%, 0.6% and 2.9%, respectively.The index lost 0.6% on Tuesday after the Trump administration dismissed U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Additionally, Trump ordered Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) to abandon the planned takeover of QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report), following which shares of Qualcomm declined and weighed on the broader markets.Meanwhile, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 0.2% in February, in line with the consensus estimate. This figure was lower than January’s increase of 0.5%. This development significantly reduced rate hike fears.The index decreased 1% on Wednesday, ending in the red for the third consecutive trading day following concerns over a possible trade war between the U.S. and China. Any hostile move from China will jeopardize Boeing’s performance, which is why its shares fell 2.5%, weighing on the Dow, which registered a one-day decline of around 250 points. Shares of 3M declined 1.4%.The index rebounded on Thursday, increasing 0.5%. Special counsel Robert Mueller reportedly subpoenaed Trump Organization for Trump’s business-related documents. This factor along with trade war fears weighed on investor sentiment.However, the Dow managed to post a one-day rise of around 116 points, after investors indulged in bargain hunting, seeking out blue-chip stocks on the dip. Dow component UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH  -  Free Report) increased 1.8% and was the biggest contributor to the blue-chip index’s gains on the day.Components Moving the Index Apple Inc.

1098,UTX,"With the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq indices all in the red through morning trading on Tuesday, it’s clearly not been a hot start to September, which is historically the stock market’s worst month of the year.As investors returned from the Labor Day holiday this week, several major stories appeared to ratchet up fear and hesitation. For one, investors appear less-than-impressed with United Technologies’ (UTX  -  Free Report) $23 billion deal to acquire Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report). Shares of UTX, a component of the Dow, were down more than 4.7% through morning trading hours.On top this, broader concerns about a handful of domestic and international political issues continue to loom over investors’ heads.The threat of a nuclear conflict with North Korea has reached new highs over the past few weeks, and as result, President Trump looks ready to initiate a trade war with China. Here at home, the debt ceiling drama is far from resolved, and Hurricane Irma could be poised to add to the devastation in the Gulf region.“It’s probably a safe bet that volatility will pick up in September,” wrote Hinsdale Associates investments director William Lynch.September is widely accepted as the worst month for stock market performance. Since 1950, the Dow has averaged a 1.1% decline during the month, while the S&P 500 has averaged a 0.7% drop in September. The Nasdaq was first established in 1971 and has dropped an average of 1% during September since its founding.There are many theories as to why September is such a difficult month for stocks, although we do lack one universally agreed upon reason.Some think it’s fair to blame the dip on the unofficial end of summer. The summer months normally mark the lightest trading volumes in the calendar year—a fact that most people assume is related to investors taking vacation time.Also, many major mutual funds end their fiscal years in September. Many mutual fund managers will shed their losing positions as their fiscal years conclude, which could also contribute to a weaker month overall.This year, these traditional factors will be in play yet again, but it could be a caution-inducing combination of other external elements that results in new volatility.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

1099,UTX,"Rockwell Collins Inc. (COL  -  Free Report) announced that it has finally reached a definitive agreement with United Technologies Corp. (UTX  -  Free Report). Per the deal, the former will be acquired by the latter for a total transaction value of $30 billion. The deal is projected to wrap up by the third quarter of 2018, depending on consents from Rockwell Collins’ shareowners and other customary closing conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals.United Technologies had submitted an offer to acquire Rockwell Collins on Aug 4.Purchase ConsiderationPer the terms of the deal, United Technologies will acquire Rockwell Collins for $140 per share, in cash as well as its common stock. Each shareowner of the Rockwell Collins will get $93.33 per share in cash and $46.67 in shares of its common stock, depending on a 7.5% collar as of Aug 22, 2017 closing share price of $115.69.United Technologies expects to fund the cash part of the transaction through debt issuances and cash in hand. The company is also dedicated to take necessary steps to maintain strong investment grade credit ratings.The total transaction value of $30 billion reflects the total equity value of $23 billion and the balance includes Rockwell Collins’ net debt. This purchase consideration is higher than the $20 billion value estimated last week when both the companies were engaged in talks before signing the deal. (Read more: Rockwell Collins Nears $20B Deal with United Technologies)Post Acquisition ScenarioUnited Technologies expects the acquisition to be accretive to its adjusted earnings per share after the first full year, following the deal’s closure. The takeover is estimated to generate more than $500 million of run-rate pre-tax cost synergies by the fourth year.On completion, Rockwell Collins and United Technologies’ Aerospace Systems will be integrated to form a new business unit named Collins Aerospace Systems.Benefits of the AcquisitionWith the acquisition, Rockwell Collins’ commercial and military aircraft avionics business will merge with United Technologies’ wide portfolio that includes aircraft engines, structures, cockpit and cabin controls, ventilation systems and other electronic and mechanical devices used in aviation. In fact, the deal will create one of the world’s largest aircraft-equipment manufacturers.On completion of the deal, United Technologies will burgeon to a $93 billion group as a more critical supplier of components to aircraft companies such as The Boeing co. (BA  -  Free Report) and Airbus Group SE (EADSY  -  Free Report). Thus with the acquisition, a new aircraft bellwether will emerge, claiming a significant position in the aerospace-defense space.Post acquisition, United Technologies is expected to have global sales of around $67-$68 billion, based on anticipated results.Our ViewThe takeover will create a new giant in the space for aircraft parts makers. It is expected to emerge as the world’s fourth largest aerospace firm by revenue after Boeing, Airbus and Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report). The move is intended to counter aircraft stalwarts like Boeing and Airbus, which are aiming to capture major portion of the profits earned by their suppliers. Both the aerospace biggies are putting pressure on suppliers to lower the prices and are moving into the high-margin aftermarket arena for parts and services. To this end, in July, Boeing had threatened Rockwell Collins with the warning that it will build up its own avionics business.Notably, United Technologies will gain a strong negotiating status with the consolidation of Rockwell Collins as it will be able to manufacture as many as components required on each aircraft.Price PerformanceRockwell Collins has outperformed the broader industry in the last 12 months. The company’s shares have soared 53.5% compared with the industry’s gain of 26.1% in the same period.The outperformance may have been driven by the fact that Rockwell Collins continues to be the foremost global supplier of communications and avionics equipment for both commercial and military customers.Zacks RankRockwell Collins currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1101,UTX,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics segment recently secured a modification contract for F-35 jet to support the Israel defense force. Work related to this deal is expected to be over by December 2021.Details of the DealValued at $148 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed Martin will procure Israel-unique weapons certification, modification kits, and electronic warfare analysis in support of the F-35 Lightning II Israel system design and development. This will offer 3F+ fleet to the government of Israel under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program.Majority of the work will be carried out in Orlando, FL; El Segundo, CA; Fort Worth, TX and Nashua, NH.  FMS funds will be utilized to finance the task.A Brief Note on F-35Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is a 5th Generation, single-seat, single-engine fighter jet. It offers a combination of advanced stealth as well as fighter speed and agility, fully fused sensor information, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment.With Lockheed Martin being the primary partner, the F-35 program has been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors like Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report), BAE Systems plc (BAESY  -  Free Report) and Pratt & Whitney — an unit of United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report).Our ViewThanks to its diverse state-of-the art defense equipment, Lockheed Martin remains the largest U.S. defense contractor. Notably, the F-35 program continues to be a primary growth driver for the company.  Evidently, Lockheed Martin witnessed 12% top-line growth in the fourth quarter for its Aeronautics segment, primarily driven by the F-35 program. The company delivered 66 F-35 aircraft that represents an annual growth of 44% in 2017. Management expects this momentum to continue and the company to deliver approximately 90 jets in 2018, reflecting year-over-year growth of 35%. Over the next few years, Lockheed Martin expects to achieve full-rate production for F-35.In terms of delivery, till date the company has dispatched more than 265 F-35 jets to the United States and international customers. Production of the F-35 aircraft is expected to continue for many years given the U.S. government's current inventory target of 2,443 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy.Apart from its strong demand scenario in the domestic market, the F-35 program enjoys a solid forte in the international front as well.  Evidently, Norway received its first three conventional, take-off and landing F-35As, during the fourth quarter of 2017. Moreover in 2017, seven of Lockheed Martin’s 11 international customers accepted the F-35 deliveries. This shows the notable demand F-35 enjoys in the international market as well.According to a report by Reuters, Germany’s 85 Tornado jets will go out of service by 2030. In relation to this the country has identified F-35 along with Boeing’s F-15 and F/A-18E/F jets as their next best alternatives. If chosen as the ultimate jet for the country, it goes without saying that F-35 program will witness a major surge in its growth.Currently, the company expects to generate revenues in the range of $50.0-$51.5 billion in 2018. We believe winning such orders, like the latest one, will entitle Lockheed Martin to achieve these targets.Price MovementShares of Lockheed Martin have moved up 38.1% over a year, underperforming the 57.2% rally of the industry it belongs to. This could be because the earlier budget cuts have put pressure on the company’s top-line growth. Zacks Rank Lockheed Martin sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1103,UTX,"The defense industry has experienced quite the boom since President Donald Trump took office. Back in February, he initially unveiled plans to significantly increase federal spending related to national security, seeking $54 billion to spend on a variety of defense-related systems and stoking a rally in defense stocks.Then there’s the multi-billion-dollar arms deal reached in May with Saudi Arabia. The transaction was a way to both improve a decades-long alliance with the world’s largest oil exporter, as well as potentially lead to additional sales to other countries in the region. Defense giants like Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report)—whose technology was part of the agreement—Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), and Raytheon (RTN  -  Free Report) will all likely benefit.And recently, the industry has undergone a small wave of consolidation. United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report) announced a major $30 billion deal to acquire Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report), creating one of the world’s largest aircraft-equipment manufactures. Not long after, Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) said it would be buying Orbital ATK  in order to expand and increase its defense footprint; Orbital notably holds a contract with NASA to resupply the International Space Station with its Antares rocket.As defense stocks and funds like the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA  -  Free Report) continue to gain this year, let’s take a look at three top picks for your portfolio.Engility Holdings Inc. (EGL  -  Free Report)Headquartered in Chantilly, Virginia, Engility Holdings provides government services in engineering, professional support, and mission support to customers in the U.S. Department of Defense, federal civilian agencies, and allied foreign governments. Its innovate solutions range from offering views of battlespaces to airborne platforms to providing advanced communications to support first responders, among many other services.Engility is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the past seven quarters, boasting an average earnings surprise of 23.5%. Looking ahead, Engility expects year-over-year earnings growth of nearly 40% for the current year, with three positive revisions in the last 60 days. Sales, however, are expected to dip about 5% in the same time frame, but should bounce back by next fiscal year.Shares of EGL have had a quiet 2017 so far, but the company sits in a strong industry; Aerospace-Defense is in the top 23% of all industries ranked by Zacks, and has returned well over 38% year-to-date. Engility reports its next quarterly earnings in early November.Northrop Grumman Corp.Northrop Grumman provides innovative solutions in systems integration, defense electronics, and information technology for the U.S. and international militaries, government and commercial customers, as a prime contractor, principal subcontractor, team member, or preferred supplier. Northrop is headquartered in Falls Church, Virginia.Sitting at a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, Northrop has started off strong in 2017. Both its earnings and revenue figures for the second quarter surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, and it looks like the rest of the year will continue to see improved growth. Northrop expects year-over-year earnings growth of about 14% for the current year, and sales growth of about 3.18% for the same time frame; nine analysts have revised their earnings estimate upward in the last 60 days compared to none lower.Northrop also has a history of beating expectations, soaring past consensus estimates over the past four consecutive quarters. The defense contractor has an average earnings surprise of almost 12.6%. Like Engility, the company resides in the Aerospace-Defense industry. Northrop is set to report its next quarterly earnings on October 25 before the bell.Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc.

1104,UTX,"Over the past few years, consolidation has become an important trend in nearly every major global industry. There’s no one reason why—although changing consumer trends, globalization, and emerging technologies are our primary culprits—but all around the world, we’ve seen countless household names join forces and shrink the competition pool.2017 has certainly extended this trend. In fact, according to the IMAA, the total global value of M&A deals is expected to once again eclipse the $4.0 trillion mark—on the back of a near-record 40,000 transaction year.Investors will also note that this year’s deals have included some of Wall Street’s most powerful brands and have had industry-rattling consequences. To celebrate this, we’ve compiled our list of the most important M&As of 2017!In no particular order, check them out now:1.       United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report)) Buys Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report)We’ll start with the newest deal on the list, as the details of this acquisition weren’t made official until early last month. Per the merger agreement, United Technologies will acquire Rockwell Collins for $140 per share in cash and stock.Upon completion, Rockwell Collins’ aircraft avionics business will merge with United Technologies’ wide portfolio—which includes aircraft engines, structures, cockpit and cabin controls, ventilation systems, and other devices—to create a brand new aircraft behemoth.Post-acquisition, United Technologies is expected to have global sales of around $67-$68 billion, and the deal is expected to generate $500 million of run-rate pre-tax cost synergies by the fourth year. Because of Rockwell’s status as a supplier to Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), the acquisition is also expected to give United Technologies greater negotiating power in the industry. 2.       Intel (INTC  -  Free Report)) Acquires MobileyeAs the public grows more and more obsessed with the impending rollout of self-driving cars, Intel’s acquisition of Mobileye has certainly emerged as one of the year’s most meaningful buyouts.The semiconductor giant scooped up the Israeli autonomous vehicle tech firm in a deal worth a staggering $15.3 billion, making it the biggest purchase of a company focused solely on the self-driving market to-date.The acquisition underscored the massive amount of cash that’s being spent on autonomous driving right now. Intel’s own automated driving group has now joined forces with Mobileye’s renowned computer vision technology, immediately cementing Intel’s status as a leader on the chip side of the business. 3.       JAB Holdings Purchases Panera BreadIn a move that has had major ramifications for the retail restaurant industry, German conglomerate JAB Holdings purchased fast-casual chain Panera Bread for $315 per share earlier this year. With the deal, JAB added Panera’s bakery cafes to its portfolio of breakfast-oriented brands, which includes Krispy Kreme, Einstein Bros. Bagels, and Keurig Green Mountain.The buyout was another major deal in a series of several purchases involving notable restaurant chains. Also this year, Darden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report) snapped up Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, and Burger King owner Restaurant Brands International (QSR  -  Free Report) bought out Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen.In its most recent quarter before the buyout was announced, Panera reported that company-owned comparable store sales increased 5.3%. It had been an up-and-down few years for Panera’s stock, but JAB appeared to snag the brand at an opportune time. 4.       Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report)) Scoops Up Kite Pharma Without a doubt, Gilead’s acquisition of Kite Pharma will go down as one of 2017’s most important biotech deals. Industry behemoth Gilead will pay $180.00 per share in cash for Kite, valuing the buyout at nearly $12 billion.How could a relatively small biotech research firm be worth that much money? Well, it comes down to Kite’s pipeline, which includes a CAR-T therapy that is expected to be approved by the FDA in November.CAR-T is a newly emerging method of treating cancer that includes making genetic changes to a patient’s immune T-cells and reinjecting them into the body to attack cancer cells. Many industry analysts believe that CAR-T will revolutionize the cancer treatment market, and Gilead’s deal with Kite was one of the first major investments in CAR-T by a large biotech company. 5.       Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report)) Buys Whole FoodsLast but not least, we have the monumental Amazon-Whole Foods deal. This one was obviously going to make the list, as it is has been perhaps the biggest headline on Wall Street all year and has major consequences for several industries.The deal was valued at $13.7 billion, or $42 per Whole Foods share. This was a somewhat surprising move by Amazon—and not because the company is shy about spending money. No, what shocked investors was the fact that Amazon was willing to spend nearly $14 billion on what many considered to be a gamble with a brick-and-mortar retailer.We’ve already seen Amazon slash prices on several popular products throughout Whole Foods stores, and we expect to see the e-commerce king parlay its new real estate into an advantage for delivering goods. Whether Amazon paid the right price for Whole Foods is up for debate, but this is a future-minded move that will take years to fully develop. Want more stock market analysis from this author?

1105,UTX,"Benchmarks closed mostly in the red on Monday with both the Dow and S&P 500 declining, while the Nasdaq increased over the day. Ever since President Trump imposed fresh levies on steel and aluminum imports investors have been concerned over prospects of a trade war. Fears of this nature dragged industrials lower during the session, a decline which weighed on the broader markets. However, tech-heavy index Nasdaq managed to end at new highs for second straight day following an investor friendly jobs report on Friday.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 0.6%, or 156.64 points, to close at 25,178.61. The S&P 500 fell 0.1% to close at 2,783.02. However, the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,588.33, gaining 0.4%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 7% to close at 15.67. A total of 6.52 billion shares were traded on Monday, lower than the last 20-session average of 7.2 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.22-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.Trump’s Tariff Law to Initiate Trade War?On Mar 8, President Trump signed his tariff plan into law, which will come into effect from Mar 23. Per this law, fresh levies have been imposed on steel and aluminum imported from other countries. However, the plan excludes countries like Canada and Mexico, offering Trump a chance to renegotiate terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the two countries.However, Trump’s protectionist stance raised concerns over a possible retaliation by other countries with similar kind of moves. This in turn had a negative impact on the Industrial Select Sector SPDR (XLI) which declined 1.2%, becoming the biggest loser among the S&P 500 sectors. Three Dow components from this sector, United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) declined 1.9%, 0.6% and 2.9%, respectively.Nasdaq Hits All-Time High For Second Straight DayThe tech-based index hit an all-time high for the second consecutive trading day. Shares of Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) rose 3.6% after a statement from the White House stated that the “proposed takeover” of QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) by Broadcom “is prohibited.” President Trump signed an Executive Order late on Monday, which ordered both the companies to ""immediately and permanently abandon the proposed takeover.""Broadcom was the second best performing stock among the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK). The sector rose 0.3% with two of its key holdings, Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) increasing 1% and 0.4%, respectively.

In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9 cents. Over the trailing four quarters, 3M reported an average positive earnings surprise of 1.3%, beating estimates thrice and matching them once. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.        Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that 3M has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP:3M has an Earnings ESP of +1.16%, as the Most Accurate estimate of $2.62 is pegged above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.59.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.3M Company: Price and EPS Surprise3M Company Price and EPS Surprise 3M Company Price and EPS Surprise | 3M Company QuoteZacks Rank: 3M carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.What’s Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?In the last three months, 3M’s shares yielded a return of 9.38%, outperforming the industry tally of a gain of 0.29%.3M expects to deliver sustainable increase in earnings and free cash flow, driven by benefits from long-term strategy of investment in high-growth programs.

These investments are expected to support its organic growth and deliver premium margins.Portfolio management and business transformation are also key catalysts on which the company intends to focus going ahead.Earning for the quarter are likely to increase 24.31% year over year on higher revenues. 3M's global footprint, diversified product portfolio and the ability to penetrate in different markets have been its forte. During the five-year period from 2016–2020, 3M expects 8–11% growth in earnings per share driven by an organic sales growth of 2–5%.The company expects about 20% return on invested capital during this tenure with a free cash flow conversion rate of 100%. Furthermore, 3M is standardizing its business processes through a new, global ERP system. The company expects these efforts to result in $500 to $700 million in annual operational savings by 2020, and an additional $500 million reduction in working capital. Such focused attempts to maintain growth momentum is commendable.Other Key StocksHere are some stocks within the sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:AptarGroup, Inc. (ATR  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +1.03%, and a Zacks Rank #2.Avery Dennison Corporation (AVY  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +1.68%, and a Zacks Rank #2.United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +2.26%, and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?                                                                                                                                                        Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.

1108,UTX,"Confirming industry grapevines, diversified industrial conglomerate United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) recently inked a definitive agreement to acquire Iowa-based avionics firm, Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report). The strategic transaction is likely to create an industry behemoth with an unrivaled competitive advantage, being one of the largest aircraft equipment manufacturers in the world in its individual capacity.The MergerUnited Technologies acquired Rockwell Collins for $140 per share in a combination of cash and stock. Under the terms of the agreement, each Rockwell Collins shareholder is entitled to receive $93.33 per share in cash and the balance amount or $46.67 in United Technologies’ shares. This equates to a purchase price of $30 billion, including Rockwell Collins' net debt.The company expects to fund the transaction through secondary debt offering and available cash while maintaining solid investment grade credit ratings. The transaction is likely to close by the third quarter of 2018, subject to mandatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.United Technologies has outperformed the industry with an average year-to-date return of 7.6% as against a decline of 1.9% for the latter.Likely BenefitsThe acquisition is expected to offer United Technologies a bigger clout in the industry and increase its bargaining power as it would emerge as one of the largest aircraft equipment manufacturers. The combined company would be better suited to meet the evolving global customer needs. With complementary products, the combination is likely to yield operating synergies through lower operating costs and more opportunities to cross sell the products. United Technologies expects the merger to be accretive to adjusted earnings per share after the first full year of combined operations with synergies to the tune of more than $500 million.Post completion, Rockwell Collins and United Technologies’ UTC Aerospace Systems division will be integrated to create a new business unit called Collins Aerospace Systems. On a pro forma basis, Rockwell Collins is expected to record sales in excess of $8 billion while United Technologies is likely to generate global sales of approximately $67 billion to $68 billion.  Moving ForwardWith an improvised product portfolio, the company is likely to become an even more critical supplier of components to big aircraft manufacturers like The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Airbus SE (EADSY  -  Free Report). The consolidation of two industry heavyweights could further set off a wave of similar such deals across the defense industry.The acquisition is expected to boost United Technologies’ aerospace segment that has been struggling of late with severe delays in for supply orders in the Pratt & Whitney division.

1109,UTX,"Wall Street witnessed a decent rally of the defense stocks at the onset of this week owing to North Korea’s missile launch that flew over Japan's Hokkaido island before crashing in to the sea.

1112,UTX,"Rockwell Collins Inc. (COL  -  Free Report) is set to close a deal, per which it is expected to be acquired by United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), for more than $20 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal. United Technologies had submitted an offer to acquire the the company on Aug 4.Details of the AcquisitionRockwell Collins, which has a market capitalization of $19.3 billion, on being successfully acquired, would expand United Technologies’ aerospace group. This, in turn, will offer an opportunity to separate the group from the company’s other industrial units. However, this deal has not yet been confirmed as both companies are in talks and currently nearing the closure of the deal.If the transaction is finalized, Rockwell Collins’ commercial and military aircraft avionics business will merge with United Technologies' wide portfolio, which includes aircraft engines, structures, cockpit and cabin controls, ventilation systems and other electronic and mechanical devices used in aviation.Per the Journal, United Technologies and Rockwell Collins are considering an acquisition deal worth almost $140 per share.Benefits of the MergerThe buyout will help United Technologies to become a $93-billion group and a more critical supplier of components to aircraft companies such as The Boeing co. (BA  -  Free Report) and Airbus Group SE (EADSY  -  Free Report).In fact, the above discussed deal will create one of the world’s largest aircraft-equipment manufacturers. Moreover, it is expected to clear the way for Rockwell Collins to capitalize on connected aircraft, which can broadcast sophisticated data regarding onboard systems, routes and weather, facilitating airlines to develop operations and maintenance.Our ViewIn April, Rockwell Collins acquired B/E Aerospace, a maker of aircraft seats, lavatories and galleys, which broadened its product lines. With this buyout, the company currently has almost 30,000 employees, and projects its annual revenue to be more than $8 billion, based on 2016 results.Markedly, this acquisition combined Rockwell Collins’ capabilities in flight deck avionics, cabin electronics, mission communications, simulation and training, and information management systems with B/E Aerospace's array of cabin interior products. Also, Rockwell Collins expanded its avionics business on the back of this deal, in a bid to provide aircraft data networking services, known as FOMAX, for all new Airbus A320 aircraft starting in 2018.Considering this, if United Technologies eventually acquires Rockwell Collins, a new defense bellwether will emerge, boasting a significant share of the aerospace-defense industry.Price PerformanceRockwell Collins has outperformed the broader industry in a year's time. The company’s shares have soared 55.3% compared with the industry’s gain of 26.3% during the same period.Being the foremost global supplier of communications and avionics equipment for both commercial and military customers resulted in higher volume of sales for Rockwell Collins.

1113,UTX,"Shares of General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) dipped more than 1% on Wednesday, extending the struggling conglomerate’s nearly 25% slump over the past two months. At these levels, many investors might sense an opportunity to buy on the dip as the historic company looks to turn things around. However, a number of lingering problems—including President Trump’s proposed tariffs—could continue to cause issues for GE.Recent ChallengesOn top of sluggish activity in its core businesses and mounting debt issues, General Electric faces regulatory headwinds. The company recently adopted new accounting standards that restated its earnings for fiscal 2016 and 2017—a move that came on the back of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into GE’s accounting for lengthy service contracts.The once-dominant industrial behemoth also faces potential legal action over allegations that two of its financial units violated U.S. law related to subprime mortgages. General Electric is now looking to shed as much as $20 billion worth of assets to trim some of the fat from its existing structure.Meanwhile, the Trump Administration’s latest trade rhetoric could add even more problems to GE’s growing list. If Trump’s proposed 25% tariff on imported steel and 10% levy on non-U.S. aluminum becomes a reality, it could lead to a rapid rise in prices that would force GE to re-value its roughly $134 billion backlog across its power, renewable energy, and oil & gas businesses.Current ValuationGeneral Electric’s struggles are hardly new, and the stock has now lost more than 50% over the past year. But even with this monumental slump, GE does not present great value for investors looking to buy on the dip.Our system lumps seven other companies into GE’s peer group, including other massive conglomerates like Honeywell (HON  -  Free Report) and United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report).  Here’s a look at how the company’s Forward P/E stacks up against that group:Considering how drastically GE has been sold off within the past year, it might surprise investors to learn that the stock is still trading at a slight premium to its larger peer group. In addition to this unattractive P/E, General Electric’s PEG ratio of 2.8 is not great, and its current cash flow of $1.69 per share is less than the industry average of $2.05.Overall, GE is holding a “D” grade for Value in our Style Scores system.Estimate Revision TrendsGeneral Electric is also currently sporting a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). But the Zacks Rank does not necessarily consider the aforementioned valuation metrics. Instead, the proven strategy focuses on earnings estimates and estimates revisions to determine which stocks have an improving outlook and which stocks are trending in the wrong direction.Here’s a look at the revision trend for GE:As we can see, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has come down significantly on the back of universal downward agreement among revising analysts.Some might assume that the worst of the damage is already done for GE, but analyst estimates actually tend to come down gradually over time. As GE continues to struggle, analysts could become increasingly bearish, adding even more volatility to the stock.Want more market analysis from this author?

1114,UTX,"Industrial goods manufacturer General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jan 24. The company’s Aviation segment is likely to report lower profit in the quarter owing to challenging market conditions.Whether this would hurt the bottom line of the company remains to be seen.Solid 3Q PerformanceIn third-quarter 2017, GE Aviation recorded revenues of $6,816 million, up 8% year over year driven by strong growth in global passengers and air freight volume. Orders in the quarter improved 12% to $6.9 billion led by equipment orders (up 8%). The military equipment orders were up 10% year over year. Service orders grew 13% with commercial services up 11% on spare parts growth of 21%. Military services were up 56% driven by orders for advanced combat engine and advanced helicopter programs.Operating profit of $1,680 million was up 12% primarily driven by volume, structural cost productivity and value gap, partially offset by margin pressure from higher LEAP shipments. Operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 24.6%.Accounting for 20.4% of total revenues in third-quarter 2017, Aviation forms an integral part of GE as CEO John Flannery intends to focus on just three core segments — Power, Aviation and Healthcare. He aims to gradually exit all other businesses to plug the downtrend in its shares. Incidentally, GE was the worst performer of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2017, tanking 44.8% in the year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Aviation revenues in fourth-quarter 2017 is currently pegged at $7,203 million compared with $7,187 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Operating profit for the segment is expected to be $1,592 million, down from $1,749 million in the prior year as margins are expected to be under pressure from higher LEAP shipments.Overall 4Q ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Industrial segment profit in the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at $4,954 million compared with year-ago profit of approximately $5,842 million. Almost all the sub-segments within the Industrial segment are likely to record leaner profits on a year-over-year basis except Healthcare. Total Industrial segment’s revenues are likely to be marginally up to $31,570 million from $31,236 million in the year-earlier quarter, although total corporate revenues are expected to be down to $32,693 million from $33,088 million.The company is likely to report lower industrial segment profit in the quarter owing to higher operating costs and $6.2 billion charges from the legacy insurance business. GE’s fourth-quarter earnings are likely to be hit by high overall expenses with the Zacks Consensus Estimate being pegged at 28 cents. (Read more: Will Lower Industrial Segment Profit Hurt GE's Q4 Earnings?)Moving ForwardFlannery has termed 2018 as a “reset year” and is seriously contemplating to spin off its operations to maximize shareholder returns. In addition, GE aims to reduce overhead costs by $2 billion in 2018, majority of which is likely to come from the power segment that sells electrical generation equipment. The company further intends to sell assets worth $20 billion to improve its liquidity. Also, the company halved its quarterly dividend to 12 cents per share — the first dividend cut since 2009 at the peak of the recession.Amid such drastic portfolio restructuring initiatives, management has decided to continue its thrust for the Aviation segment, which remains one of the three core segments for the company.Other stocks from the industry that are likely to report their fourth-quarter earnings soon include 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report), Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) and United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report).The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

On an organic basis, orders increased 4% in the domestic market, 8% in Europe and 11% in emerging markets driven by 20% growth in China.

Order for life sciences products were up 14%, driven by bioprocess (up 17%) and core imaging (up 9%).Operating profit was up 14% to $820 million, driven by volume and productivity gains partially offset by price and program investments. Operating margin expanded 140 basis points to 17.4%.Accounting for 14.1% of total revenues in third-quarter 2017, Healthcare forms an integral part of GE as CEO John Flannery intends to focus on three core segments — Power, Aviation and Healthcare.  He aims to gradually exit all other businesses to plug the downtrend in the company’s shares. Incidentally, GE was the worst performer of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2017, tanking 44.8% in the year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Healthcare revenues in fourth-quarter 2017 is currently pegged at $5,247 million compared with $5,101 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Operating profit for the segment is expected to be $1,103 million, up from $1,030 million in the prior year.Overall 4Q ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Industrial segment profit in the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at $4,954 million compared with year-ago profit of approximately $5,842 million. Almost all the sub-segments within the Industrial segment are likely to record leaner profits on a year-over-year basis except Healthcare. Total Industrial segment’s revenues are likely to be marginally up to $31,570 million from $31,236 million in the year-earlier quarter, although total corporate revenues are expected to be down to $32,693 million from $33,088 million.The company is likely to report lower industrial segment profit in the quarter owing to higher operating costs and $6.2 billion charges from the legacy insurance business. GE’s fourth-quarter earnings are likely to be hit by high overall expenses with the Zacks Consensus Estimate being pegged at 28 cents. (Read more: Will Lower Industrial Segment Profit Hurt GE's Q4 Earnings?)Moving ForwardFlannery has termed 2018 as a “reset year” and is seriously contemplating to spin off its operations to maximize shareholder returns. In addition, GE aims to reduce overhead costs by $2 billion in 2018, majority of which is likely to come from the power segment that sells electrical generation equipment. The company further intends to sell assets worth $20 billion to improve its liquidity. Also, the company halved its quarterly dividend to 12 cents per share — the first dividend cut since 2009 at the peak of the recession.Amid such drastic portfolio restructuring initiatives, management has decided to continue its thrust for the Healthcare segment, which remains one of the three core segments for the company.Other stocks from the industry that are likely to report their fourth-quarter earnings soon include 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report), Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) and United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report).  The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1116,UTX,"Pratt & Whitney, an operating segment of United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), recently delivered the first of 63 A321neo aircraft, powered by its PurePower Geared Turbofan engines to Vietjet airlines.With this delivery, Vietjet — Vietnam's largest airline — becomes the first Southeast Asian airline to own a A321neo aircraft. The Airbus A321neo is a narrow bodied, short to medium range, commercial airline that comes with more fuel efficient engines. Neo, short for “new engine option” also promises to lower operating costs and nitrogen oxide emissions.The PurePower engine family has proven its mettle in the industry. It has a state-of-the-art gear system, which separates the engine fan from compressor and turbine, thereby facilitating an optimum operating speed for each of the modules. While the fan rotates slower, the low-pressure compressor and turbine operate at a high speed, increasing engine efficiency and delivering significantly lower fuel consumption, lesser noise and lower emissions along with reduced maintenance costs.The PurePower Geared Turbofan engine has been able to meet the strict quality standards relating to burn, noise and emissions to receive the accreditation. The PurePower GTF engine has the ability to reduce engine fuel consumption by 16%, regulating emissions and noise footprint by 50% and 75%, respectively. The engine is reportedly being used by 80 different customers across the globe.Pratt & Whitney is a leading manufacturer and supplier of aircraft in commercial and military airspace. The two companies have shared a good business relationship since February 2016 following a contract to power VietJet's 63 new aircraft with Pratt & Whitney’s GTF engines. The airline plans to order more A321neo aircraft in the near future.Such continued collaborations and after-market services give Pratt & Whitney a competitive advantage over its peers. It has enabled United Technologies, the parent firm, to outperform the industry in the last three months with an average return of 10.4% against a decline of  2% for the latter.United Technologies currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the industry include Raven Industries, Inc. (RAVN  -  Free Report), Bunzl PLC  and 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1117,UTX,"As 2018 fast approaches, we can’t help but look back on the past 12 months, a year that was a whirlwind politically, socially, culturally, and economically.While the U.S. dealt with everything from natural disasters and gun violence to protests about racial inequality and the sexual harassment reckoning, the stock market reached extraordinary highs.The market hit 62 daily all-time highs in 2017, notes CNBC, and the S&P 500 has returned almost 20% so far. And, the top performing sector, technology, which is up around 38% year-to-date, surpassed the worst-performing sectors (energy and telecom) by over 43 percentage points.Even with this overall positive economic sentiment, which has gotten a big boost from the new tax bill, merger and acquisition activity in 2017 has been relatively quiet; deals were down 35% year-to-date through mid-November.The deals that were announced this year, though, were major, and revolved around some of the biggest consumer and technology names. Here are 15 of the best mergers and acquisitions of 2017.1. Amazon Buys Whole FoodsEarlier this summer, e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) announced that it would be buying high-end organic grocery chain Whole Foods for $13.7 billion; the deal officially closed at the end of August. While the acquisition has been off to a rocky start, it gives Amazon hundreds of physical stores and provides the company a strong entryway into the competitive grocery and food industry.2. Intel Acquires MobileyeIntel INTC said in August that it had completed its tender offer for the outstanding shares of Mobileye, a company that develops sensors and cameras for Advanced Driver Assisted Systems (ADAS); the Israel-based company is also known for its computer vision and machine learning technology. The $15.3 billion deal gives Intel a huge advantage in the growing self-driving car industry, a market they estimate will grow to $70 billion annually by 2030.3. United Technologies Buys Rockwell CollinsIn a major industry deal, United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report) agreed to buy Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report) for roughly $23 billion. This is one of the biggest moves in aviation history, and gives rise to an aerospace giant that will focus on the manufacturing of aircraft parts like touchscreen cockpit displays and jet engines, among many other things. United plans to combine its aerospace business with Rockwell Collins, creating a new unit named Collins Aerospace Systems.4. Disney To Buy Some of 21st Century Fox’s AssetsJust a few weeks ago, Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) and 21st Century Fox FOXA announced a historic $52.4 billion deal that would see Mickey Mouse’s parent scoop up a good chunk of the media conglomerate’s assets, including the film studio 20th Century Fox, the company’s TV production arm 20th Century Fox Television, Fox-owned cable networks (including FX and National Geographic), and FOXA’s stakes in international networks like Star TV and Sky; Disney will also gain majority control of streaming service Hulu. The deal, however, will likely face intense regulatory scrutiny.5. JAB Holdings Acquires PaneraFor $7.5 billion, European investment firm JAB reached a deal to buy bakery-café chain Panera Bread earlier this year, creating a formidable food-focused portfolio that includes Keurig Green Mountain, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Peet’s Coffee & Tea, and Caribou Coffee Company. Additionally, Panera is a restaurant that has managed to post steady comparable sales growth and rising revenue at a time when many chains are hurting.6. Michael Kors Acquires Jimmy Choo“Affordable” luxury retailer Michael Kors KORS agreed to buy footwear brand Jimmy Choo, a popular name in the fashion world known for its towering stilettos, for about $1.2 billion in July. The purchase had been a long-rumored one, and Kors plans on using its own massive global infrastructure to expand Jimmy Choo’s footprint. This likely won’t be Kors’ last acquisition either, as the company is now focused on forming a new, “luxury group.”7. Coach Buys Kate SpadeCoach, now Tapestry Inc. TPR, shook up the fashion industry back in May when the company announced that it would be purchasing its smaller rival, Kate Spade, for $2.4 billion. The deal is both an effort to reach younger consumers—it recently signed a deal with millennial and Instagram icon Selena Gomez—and to rebrand itself as a broader “lifestyle assortment company.”8. CVS Buys AetnaAfter weeks of rumors and speculation, drugstore chain CVS CVS announced that it would acquire insurance provider Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) for $69 billion. The two companies said this blockbuster deal would rein in health care costs and transform CVS’s 9,700 pharmacy storefronts into community medical hubs for primary care and basic procedures. It’s expected to close in the second half of 2018, and is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.9. Gilead Acquires Kite PharmaIn October, Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) shelled out $11.9 billion for Kite Pharma, marking its biggest acquisition ever. The deal gives the biopharmaceutical company access to a promising cancer therapy, and hopefully makes it less reliant on antiviral treatments like its Hepatitis C drug Sovaldi. In particular, the cancer therapy is a CAR-T drug, which many in the industry believe will transform the cancer treatment market.10. Cisco Acquires BroadSoftIn a move that will grow its software footprint, Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report) paid nearly $2 billion for BroadSoft , a company that sells cloud-based call control software, a product that is often re-labeled and sold by traditional telephone companies to their customers. This acquisition is what IT vendors dub “the future of work,” as it uses technology meant to make it easier for workgroups to communicate with each other.11. Apple Buys ShazamRecently, iPhone maker Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) confirmed that it has acquired Shazam for $400 million, a company that lets users identify songs, movies, TV shows, and commercials from short audio clips. The tech giant will be able to use Shazam to boost Apple Music. It also hopes to integrate Shazam more deeply into iOS, and utilize the app’s augmented reality technology to improve its ARKit efforts.12. Arby’s Roark Buys Buffalo Wild WingsJust last month, Arby’s owner Roark Capital Group announced that it would be acquiring chicken wing chain Buffalo Wild Wings BWLD for $2.4 billion. Arby’s has successfully executed a turnaround strategy by specifically emphasizing its unique fast-food menu selection; the firm hopes to apply this similar formula to Buffalo Wild Wings. Arby’s will also assume the debt of BWLD.13. Meredith Corp. Buys Time Inc.The Meredith Corporation MDP closed a $2.8 billion deal in November to buy Time TIME that would create a publishing giant. The Des Moines–based Meredith publishes the magazines Better Homes and Gardens, Family Circle, and Shape, among others, while Time owns Time, People, Sports Illustrated, Fortune, Entertainment Weekly, and many other print and digital media properties, and has been in business since 1922.14. Discovery Acquires Scripps Networks InteractiveIn November, Discovery’s (DISCA  -  Free Report) $14.6 billion acquisition of Scripps Networks Interactive  received overwhelming shareholder support. The merger would unite two cable programming giants; Discovery owns the Discovery Channel, Investigation Discovery, OWN and TLC, while Scripp’s portfolio includes the Food Network, HGTV and Travel Channel.15. Google Buys Part of HTC Smartphone TeamThis fall, Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google division confirmed that it plans to acquire part of HTC’s mobile division team for $1.1 billion as it grows its smartphone hardware business. Google has become very serious about its hardware development with the debut of its Pixel line of smartphones, and scooping up a chunk of HTC’s team means that the tech giant can better directly challenge Android partners like Samsung, LG, and Huawei.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

1119,UTX,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) business segment, Aeronautics has won a modification contract to procure 53,164 level-of-effort hours to support air system software integration. The company will also secure 53,122 level-of-effort hours to support flight test operations for the F-35 aircraft platform.Contract DetailsValued at $23 million, this contract has been awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD. The services will be used by the Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and non-U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) participants.Notably, the contract covers 40% of the purchases for the Air Force, 20% for the U.S. Navy, 20% for the Marine Corps and non-U.S. DoD participants each.Majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Fort Worth, TX, while the rest will be executed in Palmdale, CA and Patuxent River, MD. The deal is expected to be complete by February 2018.Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance (Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps) and non-U.S. DoD participant funds to complete the work.A Brief Note on F-35Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is a 5th Generation, single-seat, single-engine fighter jet. It offers a combination of advanced stealth as well as fighter speed and agility, fully fused sensor information, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment.With Lockheed Martin being the primary partner of the F-35 program, it has also been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors like Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report), BAE Systems plc (BAESY  -  Free Report) and Pratt & Whitney — an unit of United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report).Our ViewWe remind investors that despite offering superior air security and stability, the F-35 program has been facing some engine-related technical issues for the last few years. Additionally, it has been repeatedly criticized by President Trump for being an overtly expensive project, in the recent past.Therefore, Lockheed Martin inked an $8.5-billion deal with Pentagon in February 2017. Per the agreement, the company will deliver 90 F-35s of the 10th Lot at a historically low rate to maintain management's earlier projection of cutting down cost by 6-7%.Over the next few years, the company is likely to adopt a cost-saving initiative to lower sustainment costs for F-35 by 10%, This, in turn, will result in cost savings of $1 billion over a five-year period.In fact, we believe that the recent contract win will also enable the company to take a step toward achieving this goal and allow it to provide more of these combat aircraft at an efficiently reduced rate.Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin is enjoying steady flow of notable contracts from the Pentagon since reduction of its F-35 price. In July 2017, the company secured a modification contract worth $5.6 billion to offer low-rate initial production (LRIP) of the 11th lot of F-35. Again, in August 2017 it won a contract worth $258 million to offer LRIP of the 10th lot of F-35.Furthermore, with the U.S. government expecting to spend approximately $400 billion in the upcoming decades for the development and purchase of 2,443 F-35 jets, Lockheed Martin is trying its best to effectively reduce the price of this program. Therefore, the government is likely to place larger orders for this program, which in trun will boost the company’s profits, in days ahead.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock was up about 16.8% in a year compared with the broader industry’s gain of 34.8%. This underperformance could have been caused by the intense competition owing to its broad portfolio of products and services domestically as well as internationally.Zacks RankLockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1121,UTX,"Carrier Corporation, a unit of United Technologies Corp. (UTX  -  Free Report), has finally resolved to lay off employees at its Indianapolis factory. This decision coincides with President Donald Trump’s six-month anniversary in office and with “Made in America” week.  Thursday will be the last working day for about 300 Carrier employees as per a statement made on Jul 19. Carrier plans to relocate manufacturing of fan coils to Mexico. However, the news of headcount reduction failed to evoke negative investor response as shares traded higher to close at $123.08 yesterday.Over the last three months, shares of United Technologies, which carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), have returned 7.04% compared with the Zacks categorized Diversified Operations industry’s 0.79% gain.

Trump had then brokered a deal with Carrier to prevent the shutdown. In exchange, he had offered $7 million in conditional state tax incentives and training grants. Shortly thereafter, Carrier came with an announcement to move its fan coil operation to Mexico, resulting a total of 600 layoffs at the Indianapolis plant.Carrier has however decided to keep some factory jobs in Indianapolis as part of its commitment to employ about 1,100 at the gas-furnace plant. It has also decided to reimburse the exiting workers with job retraining programs, a one-time payment, severance pay and six months of medical insurance.United Technologies anticipates that the relocation will help it to become more cost effective and better serve its customers.

1123,UTX,"According to various media reports, diversified industrial conglomerate United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) is reportedly giving final touches to a purported move to acquire Iowa-based avionics firm, Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report). The strategic transaction is likely to create an industry behemoth with an unrivalled competitive advantage, being one of the largest aircraft equipment manufacturers in the world in its individual capacity.The Proposed MergerAlthough both the company spokespersons refused to comment on the developments, persons familiar with the deal revealed that negotiations are in the final stages and an official announcement could be made as early as this weekend. United Technologies is apparently working on the modalities of the purchase price in the vicinity of $140 for each share of Rockwell Collins that equates to a deal value of about $20 billion.The news boosted investor confidence as shares of both the companies were significantly up during the trading hours yesterday. While shares of United Technologies rose 2.9% to close at $118.70, Rockwell Collins stock climbed 2.2% to $130.74. Incidentally, United Technologies has outperformed the industry with an average year-to-date return of 8.3% as against a decline of 3.1% for the latter.Likely FalloutsThe acquisition is expected to offer United Technologies a bigger clout in the industry and increase its bargaining power as it would emerge as one of the largest aircraft equipment manufacturers in the industry. The combination is likely to yield operating synergies through lower operating costs and more opportunities to cross sell the products. With an improvised product portfolio, the company is likely to become an even more critical supplier of components to big aircraft manufacturers like The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Airbus SE (EADSY  -  Free Report).In addition, the transaction will strengthen the aviation segment of United Technologies, which includes Pratt & Whitney and Hamilton Sundstrand. This, in turn, could assist the company to spin off its aviation businesses at a later date to focus more on the sector dynamics.The consolidation of two industry heavyweights could further set off a wave of similar such deals across the defense industry. The proposed acquisition of Rockwell Collins by United Technologies is the third such transaction among aircraft manufacturers in less than a year. Rockwell Collins itself acquired B/E Aerospace this spring for $8.6 billion to gain a strategic footprint in cabin interior systems such as seats, galleys and lavatories. This was preceded by the acquisition of French aerospace equipment maker Zodiac by French aero-engine maker Safran earlier this year.Moving ForwardThe acquisition is expected to boost United Technologies’ aerospace segment that has been struggling of late with severe delays in for supply orders in the Pratt & Whitney division. We remain bullish on the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock post this transaction.

1124,UTX,"On Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that United Technologies Corp. (UTX  -  Free Report) is nearing a deal to scoop up Rockwell Collins Inc. (COL  -  Free Report) for over $20 billion.If completed, the deal would create one of the world’s largest aircraft-equipment manufacturers.The Journal reported that United and Rockwell are considering an acquisition deal worth no more than $140 per share, representing a 9.4% premium over COL’s Monday closing price of $127.99 per share and placing a $20.8 billion market value on Rockwell.Shares of United Tech, which is known for selling jet engines, landing gear, and wheels, are gaining about 2% in afternoon trading, while Rockwell stock is up about 1.7%. Rockwell is a leading supplier of aviation electronics like cockpit displays and communications systems.Bloomberg reported on a possible deal earlier this month, pointing out that a deal would allow aircraft manufacturers “greater heft” as companies like Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Airbus “squeeze suppliers for price reductions amid a planned production increase of narrow-body jetliners.”Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1125,UTX,"Companies with ties to defense spending have gained amid the nearly constant wave of missile testing from North Korea, escalating United Nation sanctions placed on the regime, and President Donald Trump’s unrelenting war of words against Pyongyang.President Trump spoke for the first time at the United Nations General Assembly yesterday, where he addressed a range of issues, including North Korea, the Iran nuclear deal, and terrorism. In his speech, Trump once again threatened Kim Jong Un’s regime with force if Pyongyang does not back down from its nuclear aspirations and cease its tests.“No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea,” President Trump said in his speech. “The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea… It is time for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future.”On top of the possibility of some type of military action in the Korean peninsula, a recent wave of mergers between big aerospace and defense companies has helped lift the industry.United Technologies Corp (UTX  -  Free Report) recently struck a $30 billion agreement to buy Rockwell Collins Inc (COL  -  Free Report), and earlier this week, Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) announced its plan to buy Orbital ATK  for $7.8 billion (also read: Northrop Grumman to Buy Orbital ATK in Major $7.8 Billion Defense Deal).Now let’s take a look at some defense stocks and their fundamentals to see if investors might want to consider them during these tumultuous geopolitical times. 1.       Engility Holdings, Inc.

1126,UTX,"Donald Trump’s pledges to meet North Korean premier Kim Jong-Un’s nuclear threats with “fire and fury” is probably one the root causes for the recent defense stock rally. But there are plenty of other factors that are fueling the sector. Let’s talk about those briefly (read: 3 Top Ranked Aerospace and Defense ETFs For Your Portfolio).Mergers and Acquisitions The aerospace and defense sector is thriving with mergers and acquisitions. Most recently, defense contractor Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) announced an agreement to buy Orbital ATK Inc. for more than $7.8 billion.As per Bloomberg, the merger would widen Northrop’s portfolio of aerospace and defense electronics and boost its expertise in composites and rocket propulsion. Also, Bloomberg cited that the deal will place the entity in a better position to compete with Boeing to replace the U.S. ground-based nuclear defense system.In early September, United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report) agreed to a $30 billion deal to buy the avionics and interiors maker Rockwell Collins. “This acquisition adds tremendous capabilities to [their] aerospace businesses and strengthens complementary offerings of technologically advanced aerospace systems,” as per United Technologies (read: ETFs to Profit if UTX-Rockwell Deal Sees the Light of Day).Trump's Afghanistan StrategyIn late August, President Donald Trump commented that as many as 4,000 more U.S. troops will be employed to handle Afghanistan’s terror issue and that he will launch a political arrangement with the Taliban. Trump mentioned that the war will crush al Qaeda and prevent Taliban from taking over Afghanistan.The President also said that a quick removal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan may once again attract terrorists to fill that gap. Since more wars mean more weapons, defense stocks rose broadly following Trump’s remarks (read: Trump's Afghanistan Rhetoric Helps/Hurts These ETFs).Strong Sector Fundamentals The aerospace sector, though making up only 2%% of the S&P 500 Index, registered 5.2% earnings growth in 2016 and is expected to log 6.1% growth in 2017, 9.9% in 2018 and 13.1% in 2019, as per the Earnings Trends issued on Sep 14, 2017.Coming to revenue growth, the sector is expected to log growth of 3.2% in 2016, 2.2% in 2017, 3.8% in 2018 and 5.0% in 2019. On top of it, plenty of commercial orders are another plus point for the sector. For example, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently agreed to sell 16 of its airplanes to Malaysia Airlines. Investors should also note that the Zacks Sector Rank is in the top 19% while the Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 16%.Passage of a $700 billion Defense Bill by Senate The Senate passed a $700 billion national security measure on Monday by an 89-8 vote. This National Defense Authorization Act would allow $60 billion of war spending, surpassing President Donald Trump’s budget proposal. The measure would approve 94 F-35 jets manufactured by Lockheed Martin (LMT). This indicates 24 more jets that were requested by the president and seven more agreed by the House.ETFs to BuyAerospace and defense ETFs like iShares US Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA  -  Free Report), PowerShares Aerospace & Defense Portfolio (PPA  -  Free Report) and SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (XAR  -  Free Report) are well positioned to capitalize on the above-mentioned factors.

1127,UTX,"Orbital ATK, Inc.  announced that the company has been awarded a $123-million order for the Precision Guidance Kit (PGK) by the U.S. Army. This order is a part of under-production contract Option 2, per which the company will keep supplying the Guidance Kits to the warfighter. In July 2016, the company signed a $69-million deal for the supply of the same.About Precision Guidance KitOrbital ATK’s innovative designs have enhanced the Precision Guidance Kit. It is a combination of guidance and fuze function for conventional 155mm artillery projectiles. The end result is an affordable, GPS-guided device that provides the warfighter necessary precision and reduces collateral damage while engaging high-value targets.Why Orbital ATK?Orbital ATK is one of the trusted contractors for the U.S. Department of Defense. Its current research and development (R&D) work is not only churning new products but has further expanded its defense and commercial market penetration. The company’s estimated R&D expenses in 2017 are expected to be $135 million. Orbital ATK is involved in more than 100 major development and production programs which assure a continuous source of revenues and inflow of new contracts.Owing to all the above mentioned factors, the company receives regular orders from different verticals of the U.S. Defense. As of Jul 2, 2017 Orbital ATK’s total backlog rose almost 4% year on year to nearly $15.4 billion, whereas its firm backlog increased approximately 10% to $9.5 billion.Acquisition by Northrop GrummanNorthrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) confirmed that it has negotiated a deal with Orbital ATK, to acquire the latter for $9.2 billion, subject to all regulatory approvals. Of the total amount, the former will pay approximately $7.8 billion in cash and the assumption of $1.4 billion in net debt. This acquisition is expected to give Northrop a strategic advantage over its archrival, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report).On completion of the deal, Northrop Grumman wants to setup Orbital ATK as a new and fourth business unit. With the acquisition of Orbital ATK, Northrop Grumman will benefit from the former's rocket motors, missiles and electro-optical countermeasure product lines. (Read More: Northrop Grumman Announces Orbital ATK Buyout for $9.2B)Expansion through acquisition is not new in the defense industry. Earlier this month, United Technologies Corp (UTX  -  Free Report) finalized the deal to acquire Rockwell Collins Inc for $30 billion. With rise in terrorism across the globe and the mounting tension between North Korea and United States, major defense companies are preparing themselves for extensive orders that are expected to pour in from Pentagon due to the recent defense policy bill. Recently, the U.S. Senate passed fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $696.5 billion, which was proposed in July 2017.Price MovementShares of Orbital ATK have returned 31.3%, compared with the industry’s gain of 14.3% in the last six months.The company’s performance is expected to be driven by diverse product offerings and rising backlog.Zacks RankOrbital ATK currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1130,UTX,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business division secured a modification contract worth $37.7 million in relation to F-35 fighter jet. Work related to this deal will be carried out in Fort Worth, TX and Samlesbury, UK.Per the terms, the company will exercise an option to conduct software conversions for structure and systems datasets. These conversions will be done to support the production of the 10th lot of Lockheed Martin’s F-35 joint strike fighter.The contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command Patuxent River, MD. Fiscal 2016 aircraft procurement (Navy and Marine Corps); fiscal 2017 (Air Force and Navy); and non-Department of Defense (DoD) participants funds will be utilized to complete the task by June 2020.A Brief Note on F-35Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is a 5th Generation, single-seat, single-engine fighter jet. It offers a combination of advanced stealth as well as fighter speed and agility, fully fused sensor information, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment.With Lockheed Martin being the primary partner, the F-35 program has been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors like Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report), BAE Systems plc (BAESY  -  Free Report) and Pratt & Whitney — an unit of United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report).Our ViewWe remind investors that despite offering superior air security and stability, the F-35 program has been facing some engine-related technical issues for the last few years. Additionally, it has been repeatedly criticized by President Trump for being an overtly expensive project.In this regard, Lockheed Martin inked an $8.5-billion deal with Pentagon in February 2017. Per the agreement, the company will deliver 90 F-35s of the 10th Lot at a historically low rate owing to Trump's intervention or to maintain management's earlier projection of cutting down cost by 6-7%.The company is likely to adopt a cost-saving initiative to lower sustainment costs for F-35 by 10%, over the next few years. This, in turn, will result in cost savings of $1 billion over a five-year period. In fact, we believe the recent contract win will enable the company to take a step toward achieving its goal and allow it to provide more of these combat aircraft at an efficiently reduced rate.Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin is enjoying steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon since reduction of its F-35 price. In July 2017, Lockheed Martin won a modification contract, worth $5.6 billion, to offer low-rate initial production of the 11th lot of F-35, while in August 2017 it won a contract worth $258 million, to offer LRIP of the 10th lot of F-35.Furthermore, with the U.S. government expecting to spend approximately $400 billion in the upcoming decades for the development and purchase of 2,443 F-35 jets, Lockheed Martin is trying its best to effectively reduce the price of this program. Also, the government is likely to place larger orders, thus boosting the company’s profits in the near term.Price MovementShares of Lockheed Martin have moved up 19.1% over a year, underperforming the 30.3% rally of the industry it belongs to. This could be because the earlier budget cuts have put pressure on the top line while the present defense budget is more in favor of the sector.  Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1131,UTX,"Pratt & Whitney, one of the operating segments of diversified conglomerate — United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) — recently announced that its PurePower Geared Turbofan engines will be used by Air China and Shenzhen Airlines. The engines will power 60 Airbus A320neo aircraft of the airline, widely known for their superior performance.The PurePower engine family has proven its mettle in the industry. It has a state-of-the-art gear system, which separates the engine fan from compressor and turbine, thereby facilitating an optimum operating speed for each of the modules. While the fan rotates slower, the low-pressure compressor and turbine operate at a high speed, increasing engine efficiency and delivering significantly lower fuel consumption, lesser noise and lower emissions along with reduced maintenance costs.Pratt & Whitney had earlier secured the joint Type Certification from the Federal Aviation Administration and the European Aviation Safety Agency for its PurePower Geared Turbofan engine in Airbus A321neo aircraft. Such coveted accreditations and continued product improvements have enabled United Technologies to outperform the industry with an average year-to-date return of 7.2% as against a decline of 6.6% for the latter.The PurePower Geared Turbofan engine has been able to meet the strict quality standards relating to burn, noise and emissions to receive the accreditation. The PurePower GTF engine has the ability to reduce engine fuel consumption by 16%, regulating emissions and noise footprint by 50% and 75%, respectively. The engine is reportedly being used by 80 different customers across the globe.The technologically superior products create a competitive advantage for Pratt & Whitney and ensure a steady stream of revenues. The company is among the world’s leading suppliers of aircraft engines to the commercial, military, business jet and general aviation markets. Its Global Services provide maintenance, repair and overhaul services, including the sale of spare parts and fleet management for large commercial engines.United Technologies presently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the industry are Danaher Corporation (DHR  -  Free Report), Federal Signal Corporation (FSS  -  Free Report) and Leucadia National Corporation , each carrying Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1132,UTX,"Industrial goods manufacturer General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 21. In the last reported quarter, the company’s operating earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents. Over the trailing four quarters, General Electric reported an average positive earnings surprise of 9.4%, beating estimates thrice and matching them once. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key Factors in the QuarterWith a reshuffle in its top management, General Electric is aiming to focus on its core industrial operations after completing the GE Capital exit plan. John Flannery, the current President and CEO of GE Healthcare would take the helm as the CEO from Aug 01, 2017, and Chairman and CEO effective Jan 01, 2018, replacing Jeff Immelt. Flannery has led complex financial and industrial businesses of General Electric across the world and is likely to capitalize on his rich experience to fuel its growth engine. Although the change in top management is yet to be materialized, it is likely to create a buzz in the market and attract favorable deals for the company, thereby improving its long-term growth.   At the same time, the company is selectively acquiring assets to boost its Industrial Internet vision and improve the top line. General Electric is also focusing on the commercialization of the Predix software through periodic updates and new capabilities to augment its revenues. Predix is designed to add intelligence to the Internet of Things applications. It helps companies to connect their machines, data and people and run industrial-scale analytics. The combination of machine connectivity with a data lifecycle management platform powered by engineering simulation helps diverse firms design their products for the Industrial Internet in the best way possible. Consequently, it is likely to generate incremental revenues for the company.Further, the merger of General Electric’s Oil & Gas business with Baker Hughes Incorporated is likely to improve segment sales with a complementary portfolio of operating assets and integrated offerings. While General Electric possess unique capabilities in fullstream oil and gas manufacturing and technology solutions spanning across subsea & drilling, rotating equipment, imaging and sensing, Baker Hughes has proven expertise in drilling & evaluation and completion & production services. However, Baker Hughes has a significantly lower operating margin than General Electric, which can act as a big deterrent to its plans to improve overall operating earnings.  Despite prudent steps to limit its financial exposure by divesting GE Capital assets, General Electric is still susceptible to various market risks. The company’s objectives of simplification and productivity improvement pose operational execution risks as well. For a company as large as General Electric, the additional revenues needed for growth are quite large, posing a challenge to developing businesses on such a vast scale.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that General Electric is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00% as both are currently pegged at 25 cents.

1133,UTX,"Danaher Corp. (DHR  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 earnings results before the opening bell on Jul 20.The company hasn't missed estimates in the trailing sixteen quarters, which is an impressive feat.  Last quarter, it posted a positive earnings surprise of 1.2%. The stock boasts an average positive surprise of 5.7% over the past four quarters.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderIn the past few quarters, Danaher has faced stunted revenue growth in its dental segment, mainly attributable to weakness in higher-margin traditional consumables business. We believe the weakness will continue to mar the second-quarter results as well. Moreover, unfavourable product mix and incremental costs associated with various new product developments, particularly in the dental segment, are expected to hurt the margin performance for the soon-to-be-reported quarter.This apart, sluggishness in some of Danaher’s key end markets, including Latin America and some European regions, are likely to impact growth. A significant portion of its revenues is derived from regions outside the U.S., which makes it vulnerable to currency fluctuations. Over the past few quarters, Danaher has been suffering from strengthening of both the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen versus other currencies.Also, the company has been witnessing relatively smaller organic growth over the past few quarters. We believe Danaher's Life Science portfolio lacks a significant upstream product offering, which has been restricting growth. A decelerating organic growth is likely to affect the company’s overall top-line performance for the second quarter.Despite these negatives, Danaher’s acquired businesses, namely Pall and Cepheid, are expected to act as key growth drivers for the quarter to be reported. Also, the company’s robust operating culture, DBS, is likely to act as a catalyst. Historically, DBS has contributed to meaningful core revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share improvement and cash flow generation. Furthermore, positive industry trends like new regulations from the Chinese Food and Drug Administration are expected to act as tailwinds, fueling top-line increase for the second quarter. Also, market traction of the recently launched products, including SMARTmatic handpiece campaign, KaVo OP 3D Pro panoramic X-Ray imaging system and CM130 coring monitoring system, are expected to stoke growth.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Danaher will beat earnings estimates in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  Earnings ESP for the company is currently 0.00%.

1134,UTX,"Leading business service provider Cintas Corporation (CTAS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results after the closing bell on Jul 20. In the last reported quarter, adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Cintas is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it possesses the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:  Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate of $1.09 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.08, is +0.93%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Cintas Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Cintas Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Cintas Corporation QuoteZacks Rank: Cintas currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. This combined with a positive ESP increases the predictive power of ESP and makes an earnings prediction likely.  Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or #5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Key Factors in the QuarterWith continued focus on core businesses, Cintas recorded industry leading revenue growth over the past few quarters. New business wins, deeper penetration of existing customers with more products and services and customer retention remains key strengths of the company. In addition, Cintas also identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand its portfolio. This focused approach for steady top-line growth is commendable.Cintas has completed the acquisition of rival, G&K Services Inc. With annual revenues of approximately $1.0 billion, G&K Services has over 170,000 customers in the U.S. and Canada. The successful integration of G&K Services is likely to expand Cintas’ customer profile and augment its revenues. The combined company is likely to cater to over one billion business customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity.Customer service is also likely to improve with increased route density. The synergies from the combined operations are expected to yield $130 million to $140 million in cost savings and the transaction is anticipated to be accretive to Cintas’ earnings in the full year of its operation. Although the transaction is not likely to have any direct impact on the impending quarterly results, it is likely to attract favorable contracts from existing as well as new customers and improve the top line.Cintas has a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity to meet its working capital requirements. Over the years, the company has consistently returned significant cash to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Its investment strategy takes a holistic view of the rapidly evolving market and deploys a dynamic capital allocation approach to focus on the relative value of the various sectors within the broader industry.In order to enhance shareholder value, Cintas has modified its share repurchase program. Under the new share repurchase program, the company doubled its share authorization tally to enable the repurchase of an additional $500 million worth of stock over a period of time. The additional shares over its existing $500 million share repurchase authorization could be repurchased through a slew of open market transactions. All these factors bode well for the financial stability and expansion plans of the company.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:United Technologies Inc.

1136,UTX,"Leading provider of technology services, United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) serves various end-markets such as aerospace, defense and commercial construction, that move according to their own cycles.Headquartered in Farmington, CT, the company’s business mix and diversification allows the it to remain profitable even during tough economic times, delivering consistent earnings and dividend growth. The company has an experienced management team and is likely to capitalize on the continued global economic recovery and deliver sustainable earnings growth in future. In order to fuel its growth momentum, the company further remains focused on four key priorities: flawless execution, innovation for growth, structural cost reduction and disciplined capital allocation. United Technologies is also seeking potential acquisition opportunities to achieve aggressive revenue targets and augment its market position.The company intends to expand its foothold in the aerospace industry with the acquisition of Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report). Per undisclosed sources, the company has submitted an offer to acquire the aircraft component manufacturer. Rockwell Collins has a market capitalization of $19.3 billion. This acquisition will enable United Technologies bulk up its aerospace group, separating it from its other industrial units. This deal has not yet been confirmed, as both the companies are currently in talks. On Mar 6, 2017, UTC Climate, Controls & Security (“CCS”) completed its planned acquisition of EcoEnergy, Wipro Limited’s (WIT  -  Free Report) energy services business division based in Bengaluru, India. EcoEnergy is a leading energy management solutions company. The completion of the CCS acquisition along with the Otis buyout closed last year, contributed to the company’s growth in the second quarter. The company expects to invest around $1−$2 billion in mergers and acquisitions this year. We expect these acquisitions to bode well for the company. These strategic acquisitions are expected to help the company stay ahead of its peers such as Federal Signal Corporation (FSS  -  Free Report).The company reported better-than-expected results in second-quarter 2017. Quarterly adjusted earnings from continuing operations came in at $1.85 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.77. The bottom line also came in 1.6% higher than the year-ago tally. The upside was driven by solid organic sales and acquisition-based growth. Net sales in the reported quarter came in at $15.28 billion, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.18 billion. In addition, the top line came in 2.7% higher than the prior-year figure.  United Technologies is also poised to grow on the back of innovation investments, robust backlog and strategic cost-reduction efforts. Backed by these positives, the company raised the lower end of its full-year 2017 earnings guidance. Adjusted earnings are currently anticipated to lie within the $6.45–$6.60 per share range versus the previously estimated range of $6.30−$6.60. However, the financial performance of the company depends on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries. It is also heavily dependent on the U.S. government’s budgetary allocation for defense. A reduction in capital spending for the commercial aviation or defense industries is likely to have a significant effect on demand for its products, which could in turn have an adverse impact on its financial performance. United Technologies designs, manufactures and services products that incorporate advanced technologies. The introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and high R&D expenses, and the degree or timing of benefits may not be correctly anticipated. At present, United Technologies seems to be facing challenges on most fronts and it would be prudent for investors to remain on the sidelines for some time.With over 8,000 employees, United Technologies has a considerable presence in the U.K. Consequently, the company is susceptible to high operating risks following the Brexit referendum. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates also affect the company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause instability in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. These undermine its long-term growth to some extent.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1139,UTX,"The earnings season is in full swing with about 180 S&P 500 companies reporting this week. About 87 S&P 500 companies have already released their results till Oct 20. Total earnings for these companies (accounting for 24.7% of the index’s total market capitalization) are up 9.4% year over year on 7.3% higher revenues, with 71.3% beating earnings estimates and 70.1% surpassing top-line expectations. Based on the hitherto observed pattern, the third quarter is anticipated to register modest single-digit percentage earnings growth on a year-over-year basis.  Per the latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for all the S&P 500 companies are expected to be up 2.6% on 5% growth in revenues. It represents a slightly tempered growth projection compared with the double-digit growth rate of the previous quarter, largely due to drag from the insurance industry that was hit hard by devastating hurricanes Harvey and Irma. However, experts widely believe that earnings growth is likely to improve steadily in 2018 and beyond.The Industrial Products sector appears modest. For the sector, earnings are expected to improve 2.6% year over year while sales are touted to rise 5% due to thrust on the manufacturing industries.Let’s have a sneak peek at two major Industrial Products stocks scheduled to report earnings tomorrow to see how things are shaping up for the upcoming results.3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) believes stronger automotive and aerospace solutions, industrial adhesives and tapes abrasives, as well as its automotive aftermarket businesses will bolster its Industrial segment’s revenues in the quarters ahead. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from 3M’s Industrial segment is currently pegged at $2,656 million for third-quarter 2017, higher than $2,582 million reported in the year-ago quarter.New contract wins are anticipated to augment sales of the company’s food safety, drug delivery systems and medical consumables businesses in the third quarter. This will likely reinforce the Health Care segment’s revenues. On the other hand, increased penetration in original equipment manufacturing platform and higher consumer electronics sales are expected to support Electronics and Energy segment’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Additionally, increased consumer health care, home care and home improvement sales are anticipated to propel revenues of the company’s Consumer segment in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimates for revenues from Safety and Graphics, Health Care, Electronics and Energy and Consumer segments are currently pegged at $1,481 million, $1,413 million, $1,302 million and $1,225 million, respectively for the third quarter, higher than the corresponding tallies of $1,448 million, $1,361 million, $1,293 million and $1,209 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.For the impending quarter, the company has an Earnings ESP of -0.17% as the Most Accurate estimate of $2.19 per share is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.20 per share. 3M currently has Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), making an earnings prediction uncertain. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 for a likely earnings beat.

(Read: Will Industrial Sales Drive 3M Company's Q3 Earnings?)The financial performance of United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) depends largely on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries. The company is also heavily dependent on the U.S. government’s budgetary allocation for defense. A reduction in capital spending for the commercial aviation or defense industries is likely to have a significant effect on the demand for its products.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UTC Climate Control and Security segment revenues is currently pegged at $4,566 million, significantly down from $4,712 million in the second quarter. Revenues from Otis and Pratt & Whitney are also expected to be sequentially low with respective estimates of $3,075 million and $3,661 million compared with reported revenues of $3,131 million and $4,070 million in the prior quarter.UTC Aerospace Systems’ revenues are likely to be $3,619 million compared with $3,640 million in the previous quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that United Technologies is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components.

1140,UTX,"Diversified conglomerate United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 24. The company is likely to report lower revenues in the quarter due to a challenging macroeconomic environment.This, in turn, is likely to result in lower earnings for the quarter.Top-Line WoesThe financial performance of United Technologies depends largely on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries. The company is also heavily dependent on the U.S. government’s budgetary allocation for defense. A reduction in capital spending for the commercial aviation or defense industries is likely to have a significant effect on the demand for its products.United Technologies Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  United Technologies Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | United Technologies Corporation QuoteUnited Technologies relies on suppliers, including third-party contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems. This exposes the company to market price volatility and availability risks. A disruption in deliveries from suppliers, capacity constraints, production disruptions, price changes, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities is likely to have an adverse effect on its ability to meet delivery schedules and thereby increase operating costs. These headwinds look all the more potent with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UTC Climate Control and Security segment revenues is currently pegged at $4,566 million, significantly down from $4,712 million reported in the second quarter. Revenues from Otis and Pratt & Whitney are also expected to be sequentially low with respective estimates of $3,075 million and $3,661 million compared with reported revenues of $3,131 million and $4,070 million in the prior quarter.UTC Aerospace Systems’ revenues are likely to be $3,619 million compared with $3,640 million in the previous quarter.Other Key FactorsDuring the quarter, United Technologies inked a definitive agreement to acquire Iowa-based avionics firm, Rockwell Collins, Inc. The acquisition is expected to offer United Technologies a bigger clout in the industry and increase its bargaining power as it would emerge as one of the largest aircraft equipment manufacturers. The combined company would be better suited to meet the evolving global customer needs. With complementary products, the combination is likely to yield operating synergies through lower operating costs and more opportunities to cross sell the products. United Technologies expects the merger to be accretive to adjusted earnings per share after the first full year of combined operations with synergies to the tune of more than $500 million.However, our proven model does not conclusively show that United Technologies is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -0.24% with the former currently pegged at $1.68 and the latter at $1.69.

1141,UTX,"Lockheed Martin Corp.'s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business division has won a modification contract to support the first of class flying trials for F-35B aircraft and release military permit to fly the same from Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carrier. Notably, these jets will be used by the U.K. government.Contract DetailsValued at $11.6 million, the contract has been awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.The work is scheduled to be completed by March 2018 and will use international partner funds. While majority of the work related to this contract will be carried out in Fort Worth, TX, the rest will be performed in multiple locations across the United States.F-35 AttributesLockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is a single-seat and single-engine 5th Generation fighter aircraft. It comes with an advanced stealth feature combined with enhanced fighter speed and agility, fully fused sensor information, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment.Markedly, the F-35B short takeoff/vertical landing (STOVL) variant is the world’s first supersonic STOVL stealth aircraft. It is designed to operate from a range of air-capable ships near front-line combat zones. Also, it can take off and land conventionally from longer runways on major bases.Also, the F-35 program has been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors with Lockheed Martin being the primary partner. While, Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) contributed its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology to this program, BAE Systems plc’s (BAESY  -  Free Report) short takeoff and vertical landing experience as along with air systems sustainment supported the jet’s combat capabilities. Also, Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), provided F-35s with the F135 propulsion system, which is the world's most powerful fighter engine.Our ViewWe remind investors that despite offering superior air security and stability, the F-35 program has been facing some engine-related technical issues for the last few years. Additionally, it has been repeatedly criticized by President Trump on being an overtly expensive project.Finally, Lockheed Martin inked a deal worth $8.5 billion with Pentagon this February with the intent of delivering 90 F-35s of the 10th Lot at a historically low rate either forced by Trump’s intervention or to keep management’s earlier promise to cut down cost by 6–7%.Going forward, Lockheed Martin's management is likely to adopt a cost-saving initiative to lower sustainment costs for F-35 by 10%, over the next couple of years. This, in turn, is anticipated to result in cost savings of $1 billion over a five-year period.Moreover, we believe that the recent contract win will enable the company to take a step toward achieving its goal and allow it to provide more of these combat aircraft at an efficiently reduced rate.Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin seems to enjoy steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon since reduction of its F-35 price. In July, it won a modification contract, worth $5.6 billion, to offer low-rate initial production of the 11th lot of F-35 Lightening II Joint Strike Fighter.In the upcoming decades, with the U.S. government expecting to spend approximately $400 billion for the development and purchase of 2,443 F-35 jets, Lockheed Martin is trying its best to effectively reduce the price of this program. Also, the government is likely to place larger orders and boost the company’s profits in the near term.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

1142,UTX,"The U.S. aerospace and defense industry has been on a growth trajectory since the beginning of the year, courtesy of  a number of favorable factors both domestic as well as international. Also, Trump’s latest moves and policies have been helping the stocks to recover from the losses incurred due to the budget sequestration imposed by the previous administration.Coming to the third quarter’s performance, the industry ended the period on a positive note racking up a market-thumping return. Evidently, the Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry gained 16.8% in the September quarter, higher than the S&P 500’s return of 3.8%.To understand what led the defense stocks to outperform the broader market, we have briefly mentioned below the factors that boosted the industry in the past three months.  Budget UpsideOf late, geo-political tensions and terrorist activities are on the rise globally. These incidents have been driving the demand of defense products, in turn providing a substantial impetus to the stocks. Also, the recent U.S. budgetary amendments have been driving the stocks.To this end, the recently approved defense bill policy worth $700 billion is worth mentioning. In particular, on Jul 14, 2017, the U.S. House passed the FY18 defense policy bill worth $696.5 billion that surpassed Trump’s March budget request worth $610 billion.Finally, in late September, the Senate approved a $700 billion National Defense Authorization Act, which included a funding provision of $640 billion for national defense spending and $60 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations. It goes without saying that the funding significantly boosted the growth prospects of defense stocks.Trump’s Take on International IssuesThe global market, during the third quarter, witnessed continued cross-border tension between North Korea and the United States as the former conducted repeated missile tests targeting the United States and its allies.ratioThese rapid altercations boded well for the U.S. defense bellwethers as rising geopolitical tensions always prompt the government to strengthen its arsenals. The hostile activities of North Korea and the U.S. administrations‘ repeated warnings to the nation, in response, provided a strong impetus to a number of defense majors, which scale new all-time highs in Q3.Moreover, in late August, while discussing his Afghanistan strategy, Trump announced plans to not to withdraw forces from the nation but “fight to win,” integrating diplomacy with military power. Following this announcement, defense stocks moved north in anticipation of escalated military actions. We believe Trump’s foreign policy will also provide further impetus to these stocks.Prudent DealsRecent merger deals between major aerospace and defense companies have also been acting as major catalysts for the industry.In September, United Technologies Corp. (UTX  -  Free Report) agreed to buy Rockwell Collins Inc. for $30 billion. Once completed, the deal will create one of the world’s largest aircraft-equipment manufacturers.With the acquisition, Rockwell Collins’ commercial and military aircraft avionics business will merge with United Technologies’ wide portfolio that includes aircraft engines, structures, cockpit and cabin controls, ventilation systems and other electronic and mechanical devices used in aviation.On the other hand, later in the same month, Northrop Grumman inked a deal to buy Orbital ATK  for $9.2 billion. With the acquisition, Northrop Grumman will benefit from Orbital ATK's rocket motors, missiles and electro-optical countermeasure product lines.5 Stocks Worth Adding to Your PortfolioWith the industry outperforming the broader market in the September quarter and promising to yield higher returns, we have shortlisted five defense stocks that have rallied more than 10% during the third quarter and have outperformed the S&P 500’s gain.The Boeing Co.

1144,UTX,"The Dow enjoyed a strong week of gains, riding on stellar earnings results. The index declined on Monday due to a spike in bond yields, which dimmed the attraction of such safe haven stocks as telecom and utilities. But the index closed in the green on each successive day, closing Thursday at a record level. The Fed’s decision to refrain from raising rates at the end of its two-day policy meeting also lifted investor sentiment.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow lost 0.2% last Friday after General Electric Company GE posted a decline in second-quarter earnings and revenues. Furthermore, decline in oil prices adversely affected energy shares, which in turn weighed on the broader markets. As per Petro-Logistics, OPEC is expected to increase crude production by 145,000 barrels per day (bpd) this month. Such expectations of an increase in production level amid oversupply concerns dragged oil prices lower.The index declined 0.3% over last week. Dismal performance by IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) and Goldman Sachs GS weighed on the Dow. Again, the Amazon-Sears deal adversely affected Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), which in turn weighed on the Dow. Other benchmarks ended the week with gains.The Dow This WeekThe Dow declined 0.3% on Monday, largely due to the fact that bond yields increased, leading investors to exit in utilities and telecom stocks. Also, shares of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) fell 1.5%, dragging down the blue-chip index. This was largely due to the fact that Merck and Co. (MRK  -  Free Report) together with its South Korean partner Samsung Bioepis Co Ltd has started selling Renflexis, a less expensive alternative version of Johnson & Johnson's rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade in the United States.The index gained 0.5% on Tuesday following stellar earning results from McDonald's Corp. MCD and Caterpillar Inc. CAT. Oil prices rose following Saudi’s decision to curb oil exports to the US. There were broad gains for technology stocks as the tech rally continued.The index increased 0.5% on Wednesday, boosted by strong earnings results and the Fed’s decision not to raise rates at the end of its two-day meeting. Splendid second quarter earnings from The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) helped close the Dow at a record high.The Dow outperformed the two other benchmarks to close at a record high on Thursday, riding on a rally in shares of Boeing Company and Verizon Communications Inc.

GAAP earnings for the reported quarter were $1,583 million or $2.58 per share compared with $1,291 million or $2.08 per share in the year-earlier quarter. However, the reported earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.   Net sales during the quarter were $7,810 million, up from $7,662 million in the year-ago quarter, but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,879 million. Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rated 3M raised its earlier guidance for 2017.

1150,UTX,"Defense prime Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business division has clinched a contract regarding F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by December 2020.Details of the DealValued at $427.1 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.  Per the terms of the agreement, Lockheed Martin will procure ancillary military equipment and pilot flight equipment for low rate initial production (LRIP) of the 11th Lot of F-35 jets. The services will be offered to the Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy, non-Department of Defense (DoD) participants and foreign military sales (FMS) customers.Majority of the work will be carried out in Inglewood, CA and White Plains, NY and the rest in St. Petersburg and Orlando, Fl and Fort Worth, TX. The order includes 36% of the work for the Air Force, 20% for the Marine Corps, 12% for the Navy, 19% for non-DoD participants and 13% for FMS customers.Fiscal 2015 aircraft procurement (Air Force and Navy), fiscal 2016 aircraft procurement (Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy), fiscal 2017 aircraft procurement (Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy), non-DoD participants and FMS funds will be utilized to complete the work.F-35 AttributesLockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is a single-seat, single-engine 5th Generation fighter aircraft. It comes with an advanced stealth feature combined with enhanced fighter speed and agility, fully fused sensor information, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment.Currently, three variants of F-35 are set to replace five fighter jets for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps as well as a variety of fighter jets for at least 10 other countries.With Lockheed Martin being the primary partner, the F-35 program has been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors.Notably, Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) contributed its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology to this program. Moreover, BAE Systems plc’s (BAESY  -  Free Report) short takeoff and vertical landing experience, and air systems sustainment supported the jet’s combat capabilities. Also, Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), provided F-35s with the F135 propulsion system, which is the world's most powerful fighter engine.Our ViewWe remind investors that despite offering superior air security and stability, the F-35 program has been facing some engine-related technical issues for the last few years. Additionally, it has been repeatedly criticized by President Trump for being an overtly expensive project.In this context, Lockheed Martin finally inked an $8.5 billion deal with Pentagon this February. Per the agreement, the company will deliver 90 F-35s of the 10th Lot at a historically low rate either forced by Trump’s intervention or to maintain management’s earlier projection of cutting down cost by 6-7%.Going forward, the company is likely to adopt a cost-saving initiative to lower sustainment costs for F-35 by 10%, over the next few years. This, in turn, will result in cost savings of $1 billion over a five-year period. In fact, we believe the recent contract win will enable Lockheed Martin to take a step toward achieving its goal, so that it could provide more of these combat aircraft at an efficiently reduced rate.Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin is enjoying steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon since it has reduced its price. Earlier this month, the company won a modification contract, worth 5.6 billion, to offer LRIP of the 11th lot of F-35 Lightening II Joint Strike Fighter. Again, it won a modification contract, worth $258 million, to offer LRIP of the 10th lot of F-35 Lightening II Joint Strike Fighter.Interestingly, with the U.S. government expecting to spend approximately $400 billion in the upcoming decades to develop and purchase 2,443 F-35 jets, Lockheed Martin is trying its best to effectively reduce the price of this program. Additionally, the government might place larger orders. This, in turn, will boost the company’s profits in the near term.Price MovementShares of Lockheed Martin have rallied 18.8% in the last one year, underperforming the 33.3% rally of the industry it belongs to. This could be because the earlier budget cuts have put pressure on the top line while the present defense budget is more in favor of the sector.Zacks RankLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1152,UTX,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) business unit, Sikorsky Aircraft, recently secured a modification contract for supplying consumable spare parts used in various weapon systems. The original deal was a five-year base contract with one five-year option period for numerous aircraft platform spare supply parts.About the DealValued at $49 million, this contract has been awarded by the Defense Logistics Agency Aviation, Richmond, VI. Sikorsky will offer the spare parts for the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and foreign military sales.The contract will utilize fiscal 2018 defense working capital funds to finance the work, which will be executed in Connecticut. It is scheduled to be completed by Jun 30, 2020.Factors in Favor of Lockheed MartinBeing Pentagon’s prime contractor, Lockheed Martin offers a diverse portfolio of global aerospace, defense, security and advanced technologies. The company’s Global Supply Chain Services (“GSCS”) offer hardware replacements for both structural and consumable parts along with a certified vendor program.For over 10 years, GSCS has been providing aircraft tires to all Navy and Marine Corps aviation activities worldwide. Within this period, the company’s performance included a 100% fill rate and on-time global delivery of 98.4%, resulting in a 400% reduction in retail inventories for Navy and Marine Corps activities within the United States.Under various programs, GSCS also provides crucial support to the three U.S. Air Force depots by maintaining a constant supply of miscellaneous, small consumable parts in more than 295,000 parts bins with 90,000 unique line items at a bin fill rate of over 99.78%. In terms of international business as well, GSCS offers support services to 55 international and commercial customers, with over 40 years of experience.Our ViewIn November 2015, Lockheed Martin had purchased Sikorsky Aircraft from United Technologies Corp. (UTX  -  Free Report). The deal boosted Lockheed Martin’s military helicopter business and strengthened its position as the world’s largest defense contractor. Also, this acquisition added Sikorsky’s world-known aircraft, Black Hawk and a handful of combat and commercial choppers to Lockheed Martin's helicopter product line.Going ahead, management expects to witness improved cash flows from the Sikorsky business unit in 2018 indicating possibilities of this business’ expansion in the near term. We believe generous fund flows from Pentagon, in the form of contracts, like the latest one, can certainly help the company achieve its desired business expansion, going ahead.Price PerformanceShares of Lockheed Martin have rallied 17.4% over a year, underperforming the industry’s 34.5% gain. This underperformance can be attributable to the earlier budget cuts that might have put pressure on the top line as well as intense competition from some of the largest defense primes like The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report).  Zacks RankLockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
