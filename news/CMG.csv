He later added that ""any brand that deals with a nearly 700-basis-point increase in food cost year over year can expect to see franchisees start to pull back a little bit.""As with other fast-food chains, Wingstop is trying to simply its digital ordering platform and has been expanding delivery service.The company closed out last year with 23% of its orders coming from digital, among the biggest share for a publicly-traded company that isn't selling pizza, Cowen analyst Andrew Charles said in a research note last week. He also said that the company will likely be spending more on TV advertising this year.Estimates: EPS to drop 30% to 7 cents while revenue climbs 24.7% to $96 million.

3,CMG,"When the stock market indicates a new uptrend is underway, many individual investors who want to trade growth stocks and make money ironically remain skeptical.A bullish follow-through signal comes after a mostly negative period in the market, so the negative reaction is natural.The reaction may be natural but, to be blunt, it's not too smart. The investor is heeding the recent past while ignoring a signal that says present conditions have changed.What is a follow-through day? It's a bottoming signal that occurs when a major index surges in higher volume than the previous day, and at least four days from an index low.The prudent investor will make an effort to buy something on a follow-through day. The stock should be highly rated and breaking out in strong volume.What if there aren't any stocks breaking out on the follow-through? That happens, and it justifies caution.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhat if the stocks breaking out are stocks the investor has never heard of? That too happens, but it only means the investor hasn't been doing his or her homework.Rallies are often made of stocks that nobody but professional fund managers and devoted IBD readers have heard about.Here are several stocks that broke out on a follow-through day in recent years and the size of the gains that followed. The condition of the relative strength line, which points to outperformance vs. the S&P 500, is also noted. See the RS line painted in blue in every daily and weekly chart at Investors.com.March 1, 2010: SanDisk broke out in volume 89% above average. The RS line was at a 52-week high. The stock  rose 57% in three months. (Western Digital (WDC) acquired SanDisk in May 2016.)On the same follow-through, Power Integrations (POWI) broke out in volume 237% above average. The RS line was also at a new high. The stock gained 24% in about six weeks.Sept. 1, 2010: Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) broke out of a solid 10-week cup with handle that featured a 154.53 buy point (1)  in 124% faster turnover than usual.The accompanying weekly chart clearly shows that volume during the breakout week surged vs. the prior week, a sign of superb institutional demand. Notice how turnover was also the highest in six weeks.The RS line was at a new high. You can see historical relative strength lines and earlier charts via MarketSmith, IBD's premium stock charting and screening service. Some of the charts go back decades in time.The stock rose 70% in three months before peaking at 262.77 and dipping beneath its 10-week moving average (2) to begin a new base.June 21, 2011: Lululemon Athletica (LULU) broke out in volume 61% heavier than usual. The RS line was at a new high. Lulu advanced 25% in one month.Lululemon, a leader in premium-priced athletic apparel, is a current member of IBD Leaderboard.June 29, 2012: Anheuser Busch InBev (BUD) broke out in volume 200% above the 50-day average. The RS line was at a new high. The parent of Budweiser rose 21% in about three months.July 26, 2012: Cabela's (CAB) retook a lost buy point in volume 271% above average. The RS line was at a new high. Cabela's posted a 41% gain in a little more than two months.Oct. 21, 2014: Snap On (SNA) broke out in volume 49% above average. The RS line was at a new high. Snap On advanced 34% in 10 months.May 14, 2015: Criteo (CRTO) broke out in volume 197% quicker than normal. The RS line was at a new high. The stock gained 22% in about two months.The point here isn't that investors should fill up the portfolio with new buys on the follow-through day. Instead, an investor should buy one or two stocks and see if they continue to act well. Avoid the extremes of either jumping in too aggressively or refusing to test the waters at all.And keep track of the relative strength line. It's an important indicator of strength.(A version of this column was originally published on Sept. 4, 2017.

Raytheon (RTN) raised its full-year earnings forecast above consensus as its Q1 earnings and revenue topped estimates. General Dynamics (GD) beat on earnings and met revenue views.

10,CMG,"Can food delivery specialist DoorDash go beyond delivering hot food to your door to dropping off stuff like diapers and electronics? Not at the moment, but that's ultimately where the tech unicorn's ambitions lie.""If you can deliver a burrito hot or you can deliver ice cream that does not melt, you can deliver anything,"" DoorDash CEO Tony Xu told Investor's Business Daily at retail industry conference Shoptalk on March 20.The San Francisco-based food delivery service serves over 100,000 businesses across 600 cities in the U.S. and Canada. DoorDash recently announced plans to nearly triple that to 1,600 cities, thanks to a SoftBank-led $535 million round of funding. Food courier rivals include Grubhub (GRUB)-Seamless, Postmates and Eat24, which Grubhub bought from Yelp (YELP) last year. UberEats, another player, is the main delivery partner for McDonald's (MCD).But whether DoorDash and its peers find success beyond hot food delivery is a question mark. Hot food is a high-margin arena, McKinsey analysts say, and players who aren't in a clear lead will have to find new growth markets.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""For the many runners up, a new hunting ground is needed, but it will be hard to come by,"" they wrote in a July 2017 report. ""Markets such as groceries or nonfood retail do not offer the same rare combination of high gross margins and high urgency as hot food does.""Even Amazon (AMZN) is in the mix. The online sales giant partnered with food delivery firm Olo in September, offering the Olo's restaurant database on Amazon Restaurants, including Chipotle (CMG), Shake Shack (SHAK) and Wingstop (WING). (The announcement pinched Grubhub stock for a session.)And Facebook (FB) rolled out a new food ordering feature in October, with DoorDash as one of its third-party couriers.""One of the hardest things about restaurant delivery is knowing where all the offline assets are,"" said Xu. ""Where are the parking spaces? Which line should we enter to pick up the food? Do we enter through the front door or the back door? All of these things are things we first must digitize, then study, then build into the product itself.""As it looks to expand to 1,000 more cities, maintaining quality is tough, he said. But Xu intends for DoorDash to become a ""last-mile logistics layer"" in which ""you'll be able to see us deliver any type of good.""Still, McKinsey analysts asserted in July that profitability will be ""out of reach"" for startups trying to expand beyond hot food. That is, ""unless they reinvent themselves and address the limitations of their instant delivery model.""YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN: Amazon Threatens Grubhub As It Expands Food-Delivery ServicesFast Food Makes Its Biggest Change Since The Drive-Thru WindowWhy The Grubhub Deal With Yelp Solves A Big Problem For Both

11,CMG,"When McDonald's (MCD) starts to bring more fresh hamburger patties to more U.S. restaurants next year, the operators and staff of those restaurants will undergo a six-week training program both on-site and off.Big training efforts like that — as McDonald's deepens its focus on training staff to handle mobile curbside-and-delivery orders and customer service in its new, digitized restaurants — will mean thinner margins for the next six to 12 months, management said Tuesday during the company's third-quarter earnings call.Worldwide, McDonald's is on pace to offer delivery in 10,000 restaurants by the end of the year, up from more than 5,000 now.Other big moves, like the company's refranchising efforts — notably in China and Hong Kong — will also take a few cents off earnings per share until the third quarter of next year, with revenue growth returning after that.Still, nobody on Wall Street appears to be complaining.""Sales Growth That Doesn't Make Us Grimace,"" read the headline of a Nomura-Instinet research note.U.S. same-store sales during the third quarter rose 4.1%, beating the Consensus Metrix estimate for 3.4%. Global same-store sales climbed 6%, above expectations for a 4.5% gain.Analysts and executives pointed all over the menu to items that boosted sales: $1 drinks; the McPick 2 value promotion; espresso and other drinks that came from last month's relaunch of McCafe drinks; Sriracha chicken sandwiches; and more recently introduced higher-margin Signature Crafted sandwiches which prompted customers to pay a bit more.Management said McCafe seems likely to be a ""significant growth platform"" for the company in the years to come, but also pointed to some basic truisms about food and people's desire to eat it.""As we've seen with both Signaure Crafted and McCafe, when we improve the taste and quality of our products to meet rising customer expectations, they reward us with more business,"" Chris Kempczinski, president of McDonald's USA, said during the call.Also boosting sales are delivery efforts in the U.S., via a partnership with UberEats. McDelivery has been popular in the evening with younger people in big cities like Miami, Boston and Los Angeles, drawing more group orders and bigger checks.Shares rose 0.2% to 163.88 on the stock market today after rising to 166.49 intraday. The stock was still within buy range of a flat base with a 160.08 buy point. Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR), which reports on Thursday, climbed 0.6% Tuesday, remaining above buy range.IBD'S TAKE: As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important. The chart action of these top stocks offers an answer.McDonald's earned $1.76 a share in Q3, beating the Zacks estimate by a penny but just missing some other consensus views. Revenue of $5.755 billion narrowly missed Zacks' forecast but edged past some estimates.SunTrust analyst Jake Bartlett, in a research note published after McDonald's earnings were released, said that the middling EPS figure was ""likely due to the difficulty of modeling the impact of selling the China/Hong Kong business (impact on revenue, restaurant margins, franchise margins and G&A).""In that sale, McDonald's during the quarter handed off most of that business to the Asian conglomerate Citic, along with Citic Capital and The Carlyle Group. Those companies will form a new operation that will be the primary franchisee of the business for the next 20 years.This month, customers have also hoovered up the company's new McDonald's Buttermilk Crispy Chicken Tenders, which are meatier and are thawed before cooking, and tend to be juicier than previous iterations, RBC analyst David Palmer said before the earnings were released.Next year could also be a banner year for the burger chain's rollout of fresh-beef Quarter Pounders. Palmer said he's heard that tests of the conversion to fresh patties have been ""All-Day-Breakfast big.""Further out, McDonald's delivery partnership with UberEats could drive up to roughly a full percentage point of same-store sales growth between 2018 and 2019, Credit Suisse analysts said last week.RELATED:Domino's Q3 Earnings, Helped By Accounting Change, Flop On Wall St.McDonald's Stock Is Near Buy Zone Again As Sales Fears EaseFast Food Makes Its Biggest Change Since The Drive-Thru Window

12,CMG,"Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) reported weaker-than-expected third-quarter earnings, revenue and same-store sales late Tuesday, sending shares lower.Check back for updates.Estimates: Earnings per share to essentially double to $1.56, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue is seen climbing 9% to $1.134 billion. Same-store sales are expected to rise 1.2%, according to Consensus Metrix.The fast-casual chain's reputation and financials last year and in 2015 were devastated by a series of foodborne-illness scares, which led to investments in more rigorous food-safety measures and attempts win back customers via discounts and promotions.Results: Earnings were 69 cents, including a 64-cent estimated charge related to a data security breach and 13 cents for hurricane-related impact. If one excludes the data breach, Chipotle earned $1.33, still below views. Revenue rose 8.8% to $1.128 billion. Same-store sales rose 1%.Outlook: Chipotle sees full-year same-store sales growth of 6.5%.

Chipotle recently reclaimed its 50-day moving average but was well off its May peak of 499 or its all-time high of 758.61 set in August 2015.IBD'S TAKE: As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important. The chart action of these top stocks offers an answer.After what Chipotle described in July as ""early operational success,"" the once-trendy burrito chain launched the dip nationwide last month. Depending on who you ask, the queso launch was seen as a pathway to recovery or an act of desperation, and much of the attention surrounding the dip has related to customers who have complained about its gritty texture.But Mizuho analyst Jeremy Scott last month said in a research note that the concerns about queso could take the focus off concerns about food safety, which the company has faced for some two years after E. coli and norovirus outbreaks.Scott said customers' reaction to the new dip weren't ideal but that ""we view a shift in consumer and media focus towards product, and away from earlier food safety events, as a positive."" He said queso might work better as a ""flavor and texture enhancement"" in other menu items.Higher labor costs and avocado prices have also raised concerns among analysts.McDonald's (MCD), which reported third-quarter earnings earlier in the day, rose 0.3%.Jack in the Box (JACK) edged down 0.1%. Jack in the Box owns Qdoba Mexican Eats, a Chipotle rival that has long offered queso.RELATED:Domino's Q3 Earnings, Helped By Accounting Change, Flop On Wall St.McDonald's Q3 Earnings Mixed, But Same-Store Sales Growth Strong

21,CMG,"Shares of Grubhub (GRUB) seesawed Friday as Amazon (AMZN) said it will expand its online food ordering and delivery business through a partnership with Olo.XOlo provides an online food ordering and delivery platform, saying it has an ""exclusive network"" of more than 200 restaurant brands across 40,000 locations and with more than 60 million customers. Its says its clients include Chipotle (CMG). Shake Shack (SHAK) and Wingstop (WING).""This integration will enable Amazon Restaurants to onboard new restaurants with ease, as well as quickly add more new choices and delivery options for customers,"" Gus Lopez, general manager of Amazon's restaurant division, said in a prepared statement.Grubhub shares fell 3.4% to close at 51.69 on the stock market today. The shares were down more than 5% earlier in the day.Grubhub is the market leader in online food-delivery services, with a market share estimated by Cowen to be 34%, followed by Uber Eats at 20%, Eat24 at 16% and Amazon at 11%.Analysts have expressed concerns that the expansion of Amazon and other competitors in the field of restaurant food-delivery services will raise customer acquisition costs and lower Grubhub profit.IBD'S TAKE: Grubhub is currently one of nine companies on the exclusive IBD Leaderboard platform, a premiums service to help readers pick growths stock. Grubhub stock is up 45% this year but its drop below the 50-day moving average today sends a warning signal for investors.Last month Grubhub announced it would pay $287.5 million in cash to acquire Yelp's (YELP) online food ordering and delivery business, Eat24. Also in early August, Grubhub and Groupon (GRPN) forged a strategic partnership to bring food delivery to Groupon customers across the U.S. In June, Grubhub acquired Foodler, a Boston-based rival, for an undisclosed amount.The scary thing for Grubhub is that Amazon is gaining rapid traction in the food-delivery category despite the fact that its ""still acting rationally and not aggressively pricing,"" said a report from Morgan Stanley in June.RELATED:Why The Grubhub Deal With Yelp Solves A Big Problem For BothAmazon Raises The Pressure On Grubhub As Shares DowngradedAmazon 'Well-Positioned' To Capture Market Share In Grocery Delivery

22,CMG,"Shares of fast-casual chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) tumbled to 2017 lows following a report that customers said that sickness and two hospitalizations resulted after eating at one of its restaurants in Virginia.XThe drop comes as Chipotle still tries to repair its image following a foodborne illness scare that began in 2015 that caused a retreat among consumers and investors. The CDC declared the E. coli outbreak over in February 2016.The company since then has poured money into instituting new safety protocols, tested out a rewards program and rolled out other marketing efforts to reclaim diners.Business Insider, citing the website iwaspoisoned.com, customers reported vomiting, severe stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea and dehydration after eating at the restaurant. The restaurant, located in Sterling, has been temporarily closed, Business Insider said.Chipotle Mexican Grill fell 4.3% to 374.98 in the stock market today, sinking as low as 362.40, the worst since early November.Business Insider said eight reports were sent to iwaspoisoned.com. According to information there, at least 13 people, who ate there on July 14 and 15, reported illness after eating at the restaurant.""We are working with health authorities to understand what the cause may be and to resolve the situation as quickly as possible,"" Jim Marsden, Chipotle's executive director of food safety, said, according to Business Insider. Marsden said the ""reported symptoms are consistent with norovirus,"" which he said does not come from Chipotle's food supply.Marsden added that the illnesses were confined to that one restaurant and that it would be re-opening on Tuesday after being re-sanitized, Business Insider said.Cowen analyst Andrew Charles said that based on the report, the incident appeared to be isolated and that another E. coli outbreak was unlikely given the quick sanitation time.""However, we do not view the pullback as a buying opportunity given uncertainty around consumer reaction to the ensuing headlines,"" he said.

23,CMG,"McDonald's (MCD) on Tuesday said it was seeing higher average checks at restaurants that had mobile order and pay, and that delivery was helping the burger chain in the later portions of the evening that were typically slow.XBut as the burger chain's second-quarter results lifted shares higher, Domino's Pizza (DPZ) crashed on weak international same-store sales and an array of other investor concerns.As McDonald's management did in its first-quarter earnings call, management spent much of its time discussing its efforts to become a more digital company via mobile ordering, delivery and a new restaurant format featuring self-ordering kiosks and table service.CEO Steve Easterbrook said it ""will take time to build awareness"" of that evolution. But the company said it was seeing higher average checks, so far, from restaurants that have mobile ordering.As for delivery, the company also appeared to be getting an early read on what was working. Sixty percent of orders were being placed late at night. Restaurants near colleges and in downtown and lower-income areas also tended to get more delivery activity than others.Management said it was on track to make mobile order and pay available in 20,000 restaurants worldwide by the end of the year, with more than 5,000 restaurants currently using it around the world. McDonald's also said that the new restaurant format, called ""Experience of the Future,"" would roll out at a faster pace next year.As for the second quarter, the company said it grew sales and guest counts in all of their top nine markets for the first time since 2008, regaining customers along the way.""Our gain will result in pain being felt elsewhere,"" Easterbrook said.In the U.S., $1 sodas and other cheap drink promotions — for smoothies, shakes and blended coffee — helped, as did its ""premium"" offerings, such as sandwiches that included toppings like pico guacamole and sweet barbecue bacon.Margins, however, fell during the quarter, due to higher labor costs and investments to prepare for digitization and the broader introduction of fresh-patty Quarter Pounders next year.Earnings per share jumped 36% to $1.70, beating estimates for $1.62. Revenue fell 3% to $6.05 billion, compared to views for $6 billion. U.S. same-store sales grew 3.9%, beating forecasts for a 3.2% increase.Shares rocketed 4.75% to close at 159.07 in the stock market today, rebounding to a new all-time high. The stock fell 1.3% to 151.85 on Monday, closing below its 50-day moving average for the first time since early November.Meanwhile, Domino's plunged 10% to 192.40, stabbing through the 50-day line at that key test of investor support, despite reporting earnings per share, revenue and same-store sales that topped estimates.But the pizza chain's strong EPS was largely driven by the tax rate, Nomura-Instinet analyst Mark Kalinowski said in a research note. He also said that domestic company-owned operating margins were lower, and that there was ""some disappointment"" that no accelerated payouts were announced after a recent recapitalization.And all of that, he said, was ""occurring in the context of a stock with higher valuation multiples than most other restaurant stocks.""While Domino's mobile ordering platform has helped it stand out in a restaurant industry that has been trapped in a discounting frenzy, and its rewards program and international prospects have been seen as key accelerants for sales. But more analysts have sounded the alarm as the company's shares have marched higher over the past year.Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh, in a research note on Monday, said ""we believe most of these positives are priced into the stock.""The pizza chain's earnings per share jumped 35% to $1.32, beating estimates for $1.22. Revenue popped 15% to $628.6 million, above views for $613 million. Domestic same-store sales jumped 9.5%, above forecasts for 7.7%.However, international comps rose just 2.6%, ""slightly under our expectations,"" the company said in a release.Once-trendy Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) reported Q2 earnings after the close that beat forecasts while revenue missed. Chipotle, still struggling to recover from food-borne illness outbreaks that started in 2015, has been hit again by reports this month of customers getting sick.Shares closed up 2.5% at 348.62 after hitting a four-year low on Monday, and rallied another 2.5% late.RELATED:Fast Food Makes Its Biggest Change Since The Drive-Thru WindowFor Earnings Trades, These 4 Names Look The Most Actionable

24,CMG,"Burger chain Wendy's (WEN) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings early Wednesday. Jack in the Box (JACK) released fiscal third-quarter earnings after the market close that were even worse than views, though same-store sales topped forecasts.Estimates: A 30% jump in second-quarter earnings per share to 13 cents, as revenue dives 22% to $299 million, according to Zacks Investment Research. Same-store sales were seen up 3.1%, according to Consensus Metrix.Results: Adjusted EPS rose 50% to 15 cents. Sales were $320.3 million. North American same-store sales rose 3.2%.Outlook: Wendy's sees full-year EPS of 45-47 cents. The Zacks consensus is for 47 cents, and that was before Wendy's 2-cent beat in Q2. Wendy's expects 2017 North American same-store to rise 2%-3% with labor costs up 4%. The burger chain still sees $12 billion in sales in 2020.Stock: Shares rose 3.8% to 15.80 in the stock market today. The stock closed Tuesday in a flat base with a 16.76 buy point.Nomura-Instinet analyst Mark Kalinowski suggested in a research note that some mozzarella-related selections — its Fresh Mozzarella Chicken Sandwich or Fresh Mozzarella Chicken Salad — were among Wendy's popular items during the second quarter. As for the third quarter, promotions for Bacon Queso items seem likely to help, he said.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), which is testing queso, climbed 0.3% to 334.59.Estimates: Fiscal third-quarter EPS down 2% to $1.05, as revenue dips 2% to $361 million.Results: EPS was 99 cents on sales of $357.8 million. Jack in the Box same-store sales fell 0.2%, but that was better than views for a 0.5% drop. Comps at Qdoba, its Mexican chain, rose 0.5%, above views for a 0.5% drop.Qdoba's comps gain came as ""as guests responded favorably to menu innovation,"" the restaurant operator said.Outlook: The company sees fiscal fourth-quarter same-store sales flat to down 2% at Jack in the Box systemwide, with company-owned Qdoba comps also flat to down 2%.Shares: Jack in the Box shares rose 2% in after-hours trading. The stock closed down 0.2% to 94.68.Jack in the Box also said that its evaluation of whether Qdoba fits in with the broader company was still ongoing.""Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC continues to assist the company's Board of Directors in its evaluation of potential alternatives with respect to Qdoba, as well as other ways to enhance shareholder value,"" the company said in its earnings release.The company added that there was no guarantee that the evaluation would lead to a transaction. Jack in the Box also said it had set no timeline.When Jack in the Box reported first-quarter results in May, it said it was looking at ""potential alternatives"" regarding Qdoba.""It has become more apparent since then that the overall valuation of the company is being impacted by having two different business models,"" the company said then.The restaurant operator at that time it ""lost ground"" to some rivals during the first quarter, amid an industrywide value-meal war that took some attention away from Jack in the Box's new menu items. Delayed tax refunds and extended rainfall in California also likely kept diners away, the company said then.IBD'S TAKE: To make up for flagging sales, more quick-service chains are turning to mobile ordering and delivery. McDonald's (MCD) closed flat at 154.92. The company on Tuesday said hopes to broaden its restaurant footprint in China to 4,500 locations by 2022, compared to 2,500 today.Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) lost 0.8% to 60.70.RELATED:McDonald's Touts Digital Progress; Domino's Falls HardChipotle, Wynn Resorts, U.S. Steel, Hawaiian Earnings TopJack In The Box Beats Views, Eyes 'Potential Alternatives' For QdobaBurger King Parent Restaurant Brands Earnings Top, Sales Miss

JPMorgan's trading revenue fell 14%, which was worse than what analysts estimated. For Wells Fargo, the negative niche was the mortgage business, which fell about 19%. Citigroup's problem was weakness in the credit-card space.This bent toward finding the flaw in the details and ignoring the overall increases is a sign of stock-market weakness.

Weaker trading and net-interest income also hurt Bank of America (BAC), though Fed rate hikes have helped the bank and it said it expected net-interest income to rise in Q3. Morgan Stanley (MS) reported that trading revenue fell, but less so than rivals. JPMorgan (JPM) and Citigroup (C) have also signaled caution amid slow loan growth and longer-term bond yields, which can indicate flagging confidence over the chances for long-term economic gains.

35,CMG,"Gripping a Starbucks (SBUX) to-go cup on the train to work may not be ingrained in Chinese culture the way it is for many Americans, but one analyst is willing to bet that the coffee giant can instead make the sit-down cafe experience a popular one in China.""With almost no scaled competitors, we believe Starbucks can do for cafe culture in China what Yum (Brands) did for fast food,"" wrote Mizuho analyst Jeremy Scott in an initiation note on the company. ""Create it.""Starbucks has made no secret about its aggressive growth plans in China, which include doubling its store count there to 5,000 by 2021.For now, tea remains the hot drink of choice for 99% of Chinese consumers at home.But Scott said Starbucks' positioning as a ""third place"" outside of home and work ""has spawned a growing cafe culture in higher tier cities,"" one that has made going out for coffee one of ""cultured indulgence.""And that's already prompting a shift in how Chinese consumers get their caffeine fix. Outside of the house, coffee and tea consumption are now about equal, wrote analysts, citing Euromonitor and MSUSA estimates.Shares of Starbucks dipped 0.1% to 62.19 on the stock market today, their fifth straight decline. Starbucks is near the top end of buy territory after overextending for a few weeks. The stock broke out of a flat base with 59.64 entry point in late April.Calling Starbucks the ""most promising growth model in the industry,"" Mizuho's Scott initiated coverage on the stock with a buy rating and 75 price target. He also highlighted the promise of mobile-order-and-pay once the company overcomes its workflow issues (read: recent issues of in-store congestion from the popularity of the order-ahead feature).If all goes according to plan, maybe someday China's coffee drinkers will be just like Americans: hogging the good tables for hours as they work on their screenplays at Starbucks.Meanwhile, Scott — who initiated coverage on a number of restaurant names including McDonald's (MCD), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and Yum Brands (YUM) — looked less favorably upon Starbucks' main U.S. competitor, Dunkin' Brands (DNKN), starting it off with a neutral rating and 56 price target.""As the take-away coffee market grows increasingly divided between value and premium, Dunkin's positioning becomes increasingly challenged as it straddles value-orientation and upmarket beverages,"" he wrote, adding that increasing competition in the form of promotional activity from McDonald's and others ""should continue to drive menu deflation in our view.""Shares of Dunkin' Brands, which owns Baskin Robbins and Dunkin' Donuts, sank 2.7% to 56.93, falling out of buy range after clearing a 57.90 entry point from a cup-with-handle base in late May.Yum Brands, which spun off Yum China (YUMC) last year, fell 1.2%.

36,CMG,"XIf an individual investor is to win consistently in the stock market, he or she must stay a step ahead of the game.While investors should always heed current conditions, they also should have a Plan B ready for when the market turns. In the current confirmed uptrend, this means investors must know what they will do when the correction comes.The market hasn't had a correction of 10% or more since late 2015 to mid-February 2016, when the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 pulled back 18% and 14% respectively.When the next pullback comes, here are five things to consider:No. 1: Be realistic. Recognition that a pullback is underway will emerge as the correction unfolds. No one can pick the market's turn at its birth, but an investor can thin holdings as they show weakness.No. 2: Expect change. Right now, chips and the mega caps have been the leaders. The leaders of one bull trend rarely repeat in the next uptrend. So, when a correction knocks stocks around, and then the market begins a new uptrend, don't expect the same leadership.No. 3: Look for resilience. In ""How to Make Money in Stocks"" William J. O'Neil wrote, ""In a correction during a bull, or upward-trending market, the growth stocks that decline the least (percentage-wise) are usually your best selections."" So, when a correction comes, study the industry groups to see what is holding together best.No. 4: Watch for new highs. ""Once a general market decline is definitely over, the first stocks that bounce back to new price highs are almost always your authentic leaders,"" O'Neil wrote.No. 5: Scan the breakouts. When a follow-through day confirms a new uptrend is underway, leaders sometimes break out on the follow-through day itself, or they emerge in the first few weeks.Consider the 2010 pullback and rally. After a 20% run-up in the Nasdaq from February 2010 to late April 2010, the market started to correct. From early May through August, the Nasdaq pulled back in a choppy fashion.Then on Sept. 1, Day 4 of the attempted rally, the Nasdaq flashed a follow-through sign (1) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) topped a 154.53 entry the same day.

37,CMG,"Flying drones drop Chipotle (CMG) burritos, 7-Eleven Slurpees and Amazon.com (AMZN) sundries on doorsteps while robots scoot down sidewalks to deliver Domino's (DPZ) pizzas and other meals to homes.These images might conjure thoughts that we've finally entered the age of mechanical gofers, or that we'll soon farm out a slew of summer jobs to robots. But hold on to your transformers for a bit.While companies such as Amazon are pushing the idea of delivery bots — the e-commerce giant now says it wants to start using them for commercial deliveries by the end of 2017 — widespread use of robotic couriers could be years away.Consumers in a few regions and limited test markets are the only ones seeing the benefits, and possible drawbacks, of machines that carry food, drinks and everyday goods to their door. And the tests are raising more questions than they're answering.For one, are these deliveries just publicity stunts designed to show consumer brands are on the cutting edge of technology? Or do they show a future where it might be practical for robots to routinely make home deliveries?""Is there a legitimate business model here? Is there a real need for this? Can I measure ROI (return on investment)? Those are the questions that need to be answered,"" ABI Research analyst Dan Kara told Investor's Business Daily.It's not clear right now that a robot can handle deliveries as fast or better than a human. Further, the long-term costs of developing and deploying bot couriers is unclear. Plus, companies have yet to figure out how to protect that mechanical merchandise.In other words, it could be some time before you'll see robot-delivered pizza on a grand scale. For now, delivery bots are very much an experiment, with companies and consumers in a dot-com-esque honeymoon phase. Some companies are dreaming big, and harsh reality has yet to set in.Amazon got the public excited about the idea of aerial delivery drones when it announced its Prime Air initiative in December 2013. It wasn't until this past March that it conducted its first drone delivery in the U.S., transporting a bottle of sunscreen to a resort in Palm Springs, Calif., during a tech conference.Still, Amazon is sticking to its vision, and hopes to deliver small packages of up to 5 pounds in 30 minutes or less by drones that can fly up to 50 miles per hour.Retail behemoth Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) has expressed interest in making drone deliveries as has Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL). Google has a drone delivery initiative called Project Wing that is looking to develop automated aircraft to deliver everything from consumer goods to emergency medicine. Last September, Project Wing conducted a test on the Virginia Tech campus, delivering Chipotle burritos by air to students and employees.The movement has prompted delivery specialists, such as FedEx (FDX) and United Parcel Service (UPS), to evaluate their options. Self-driving trucks eventually are expected to deploy small robots to deliver packages to your door. But aerial drones are considered a better solution for greater distances, especially in rural and hard-to-reach places.Gartner analyst Gerald Van Hoy believes that commercial drone deliveries in the U.S. are a few years away, but within sight. Business-to-business drone deliveries might help pave the way for consumer deliveries, Van Hoy told IBD. It is easy to calculate the payback of sending a drone to deliver a tool to a worker in the field vs. sending a human driver, he said.By the same token, business uses of wheeled delivery robots could lead to consumer applications as the technology improves and the value proposition becomes clear, ABI's Kara said.Venture capital firms and corporations are funding robotic delivery initiatives on the chance that they could become a huge deal. But that might not happen, Kara said, noting that many millions of dollars were invested in corporate telepresence robots — sort of interoffice gofers — before that market fizzled.Analysts point out robotic delivery systems could help restaurants that struggle to find enough delivery workers. They also could be a hedge against rising employee costs, especially with the Fight For $15 political movement to raise the minimum wage.Ultimately, there will be questions on regulatory restrictions and finding the right business model. Tech companies and government regulators are working out how best to allow delivery robots in the public air space and on streets and walkways. The biggest questions are business-related, and whether delivery bots are economically feasible, Kara said.A raft of companies have developed robotics, including Google, Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Roomba maker iRobot (IRBT). A few private companies, however, have come to the forefront when it comes to delivery bots.They include two startups, Marble and Starship Technologies, two private robotic firms. In April, Yelp's (YELP) Eat24 food delivery service partnered with Marble to test robotic deliveries with a handful of restaurants in a couple San Francisco neighborhoods.The Eat24-branded robots are the size of a shopping cart. They navigate city sidewalks with artificial intelligence, cameras, ultrasonic sensors and light detection, or lidar, sensors. Typical deliveries are within a mile. Customers are sent a four-digit code to open the four-wheeled robot's storage compartment.Rival delivery robot firm Starship started making food deliveries in Silicon Valley in March. Starship also has conducted trials in Austin, Texas; Portland, Ore.; and Washington, D.C., as well as a dozen European countries.Starship robots are roughly the size of large picnic coolers and have six wheels. In March, Starship announced a deal with Domino's to deliver pizzas by robot within a one-mile radius around its outlets in select German and Dutch cities.While sidewalk robots are seen as the best solution for short-distance deliveries in cities, some politicians don't like the idea.In May, San Francisco Supervisor Norman Yee introduced legislation that would ban autonomous delivery robots from city sidewalks, largely for safety concerns. Those concerns range from machines getting in the way of cars and pedestrians to lawbreakers stealing or vandalizing them.On the other side of the coin, humanitarian concerns are a consideration.Last September, UPS partnered with drone maker CyPhy Works to test the use of drones to make commercial deliveries of packages to remote locations. The companies staged a mock delivery of urgently needed medicine from Beverly, Mass., to Children's Island, about three miles off the Atlantic coast. In the mock scenario, the drone successfully carried an asthma inhaler to a child at a camp on the island.Zipline International is using fixed-wing drones to deliver medical products, such as blood products and rabies treatments, to remote locations. It currently is serving 21 hospitals in Rwanda. Its drones can deliver to any site within about 47 miles, or 93 miles round-trip. As of November, Zipline had raised $43 million in funding.""The humanitarian side of drone deliveries is starting to be talked about a lot more,"" Gretchen West, co-executive director of the Commercial Drone Alliance, told IBD. ""It's delivering medicine, aid and supplies after a catastrophe or to remote locations where roads could be washed out. We're starting to see a lot more of that, not just consumer delivery.""Already, several companies are making headway deploying robots to deliver items in structured environments like hospitals and hotels, he said. Pittsburgh-based Aethon makes delivery robots for hospitals to ferry food, medicine, towels and other items. San Jose, Calif.-based Savioke makes robots for delivering items to consumers in hotels and high-rise buildings.West says drone deliveries to consumers will happen, but will take longer for the puzzle pieces to come together. Right now, commercial drones in the U.S. face strict limitations.For instance, they can't fly over people, must be operated within visual line of sight, and can't fly at night. Many of these problems will be solved by an unmanned aircraft system traffic management system under development by NASA, she said.""It will take several years,"" West said. ""None of this moves very quickly.""

Same-store sales slid 2.5%.Outlook: Shake Shack raised its full-year revenue target to $351 million-$355 million from $349 million-$353 million. Analysts had expected $356 million. Shake Shack now sees flat comps vs. prior guidance for a 2%-3% rise.""We are clearly dissatisfied with our comp result in Q1, but as a reminder our small comp base is made up of only 32 Shacks, the majority of which exist in the Northeast region which was most affected by cold weather and the holiday shift in March,"" CEO Randy Garutti said in a statement.Stock: Shares plunged nearly 7% to 30.85 in late trading. Shack Shack had closed down 2.6% to 33.16 on the stock market today. Habit Restaurants (HABT), which topped earnings views late Wednesday, rallied 1.6% to 19.20.Buckingham research analyst John Zolidis, who expected a 1% bump in Shake Shack's same-store sales, said the results would have to compete with a strong showing a year ago, when nicer weather and the introduction of Chick n' Shack helped results.Shake Shack, which began trading in 2015, has been opening new stores. That has raised concerns about whether the company's plans to move beyond where it is already popular will pay off.Goldman Sachs, in a note last month quoted by CNBC, cited ""declining novelty and therefore excitement around unit opens as a risk to new store productivity, and … cannibalization as a growing risk to traffic trends at SHAK, as the company continues to add density in markets outside of N.Y.""Zolidis said new-store results could be better than expected, but added ""we continue to expect that new unit performance will decline over time due to geographic expansion into less productive markets.""Shake Shack stepped up expansion plans. It expects 12 net openings of licensed locations this year, as opposed to 11 earlier. The company now expects to add 23-24 U.S. company-owned stores, up from 22-23.""We remain committed to executing our strategy of growing in premier locations, investing in our teams and delivering a great guest experience,"" Garutti said.Estimates: First-quarter EPS down 18% to 14 cents, with revenue up 5% to $98.72 million.Results: EPS fell 6% to 16 cents as sales climbed to $99.8 million. Same-store sales fell 0.3%.Stock: Shares rose 2% in after-hours trading. Shares rose 0.8% to 12.50, above their 50-day average but below their 200-day line.The Mexican chain had warned that Q1 results could take a hit due to the rainfall in California, but said same-store sales got better as the weather got nicer and tax refunds increased, SunTrust analyst Jake Bartlett said in a March research note.And the California-based company's locations in Houston, which Bartlett earlier described as its ""beachhead expansion market,"" were still a weak spot.""Until its Houston stores show a meaningful improvement, we expect investors to doubt the sustainability of LOCO's unit-growth story, which should limit multiple expansion,"" he said in the research note.Rival Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) last week reported results that topped analyst expectations.IBD'S TAKE: As smartphones become more common, running a successful fast-food restaurant could become more about going digital. McDonald's, on its first-quarter earnings call, talked up its more mobile, touchscreen future. Estimates: Analysts expect the chicken-wing chain to report first-quarter EPS of 16 cents, flat from a year ago. Revenue is expected to rise 9.5% to $24.17 million. Domestic same-store sales, as of Monday, were expected to fall 1.4%.Results: Adjusted EPS was 22 cents, up 37.5%. Revenue rose to $26.6 million. U.S. same-store sales fell 1.1%.Outlook: Wingstop Nnow expects full-year EPS growth of 19%-21%, well up from an earlier forecast of 8%-10% growth.Stock: Shares soared 12% to 32.50 in after-hours trading. Shares closed down 0.6% at 29. Wingstop is in a cup-with-handle base with a 30.38 buy point, so it's likely to test that entry Friday morning.Cowen analysts believe national TV advertising during March Madness likely strengthened the company's results.Estimates: First-quarter EPS of 9 cents, up 12.5%. Revenue is expected to rise 8% to $105.21 million.Results: EPS of 10 cents, up 25%, on sales of $105.3 million. Same-store sales rose 4.2%.Stock: Del Taco was not yet active in late trading. Shares closed down 0.7% to 13.40 but are in a base with a 15.42 entry.The taco and burger chain's locations are largely concentrated in California, which earlier this year was hit by a string of rainstorms after years of drought, raising concerns about the impact on businesses more broadly. At the end of March, Piper Jaffray analyst Nicole Miller Regan praised the company's menu additions and ""expansion to new dayparts.""On Wednesday, Yum Brands (YUM) reported quarterly same-store sales at its Taco Bell chain jumped 8%.RELATED:Is It Safe To Buy Chipotle Again?

39,CMG,"Corporate earnings results grabbed front and center stage and are helping to propel U.S. equities higher in late-afternoon trading Tuesday, as the major indexes are padding last week's nice gains.The Dow Jones industrial average, boosted by better than expected results in several of its 30 components including Caterpillar (CAT) (Q1 EPS up 100%) and DuPont (DD) (EPS up 30%), rose more than 1.2%. That's better than gains of 0.7% to 0.8% for the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500.The Dow Jones industrials, at 21,002, are now up nearly 6.3% since Jan. 1, but the Nasdaq composite, breaking 6000 for the first time, is ahead with a nearly 12% gain. Big-cap techs and select consumer-oriented stocks have helped the Nasdaq's cause. But keep monitoring earnings results and see if more money flows into blue-chip-type large caps outside the tech realm.Caterpillar also notched a surprise 4% gain in revenue, its first year-over-year increase in 10 quarters. The last time the construction and mining gear titan saw a top-line lift came in the third quarter of 2014 (up 1%).Cat shares vaulted past a 99.56 flat-base buy point with a gap up at the open, and it's enjoying heavy institutional buying with shares seeing triple normal turnover. The stock opened the day at 102.80, within the 5% proper buy zone following Tuesday's breakout.The Russell 2000 rallied more than 1.2%. Volume is running firmly higher vs. the same time Monday on both main exchanges, a sign of heavy institutional demand for equities.Crude oil futures, meanwhile, rebounded after getting hammered Monday. WTI futures rose 0.9% to $49.67 a barrel but are still down more than 7% year to date.Gold mining stocks and other defensive plays led the market's downside. Newmont Mining (NEM) sank nearly 3% to 32.91 in heavy volume. The mining giant grew first-quarter profit 4% to 25 cents a share on a 13% pickup in revenue.Four months into 2017, it's clear that institutional investors are favoring certain industrial sectors over others. That's good news for stock pickers. Here are five stocks that, in addition to high-growth names in the IBD 50 and Sector Leaders, show more mature fundamentals or are turnaround situations but have the potential to beat the S&P 500. Nvidia (NVDA), $63 billion market value: The leader in graphics processors has stepped nicely into new growth markets including self-driving automobiles, datacenter and AI (artificial intelligence). Nvidia, up nearly 2% to 104.71, is trying to retake its key 50-day moving average near 103 after getting slammed below it on bearish analysts comments on April 1.The stock was a huge leader in 2016, rising 261% from a cup-with-handle breakout at 33.16 back in March that year.Nvidia sports a solid 98 Earnings Per Share Rating on a scale of 1 to 99 and earnings in the April-ending fiscal first quarter are seen rising an impressive 46% to 67 cents a share, on top of the 39% gain in the year-ago quarter. But keep in mind that in the next three quarters, Nvidia faces absolutely steep year-over-year comps, as Q2, Q3, and Q4 profit rose 56%, 104% and 117%, respectively.Given the giant gains in 2016, Nvidia's current correction is very respectable, falling no more than 21% from its all-time high of 120.92.Celgene (CELG), $98 billion market value: The highly respected biotech pioneers treatments for chronic and difficult diseases including multiple myeloma. The stock jumped 2% to 125.87 after finding vital support at the 50-day line. It's up slightly from an earlier 122.49 cup-with-handle entry.The Street sees full-year earnings rising 22% to $7.22 a share in 2017 and up 21% in 2018. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), $13 billion: The former large cap and burrito and taco chain reports Q1 results after the close Tuesday. Watch for an expected positive change in both comparable restaurant sales and see if restaurant-level operating margins show stability or improve.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), $31 billion: The robotic surgery firm, which recently posted double-digit top and bottom-line growth in Q1, is up more than 31% since Jan. 1. It bolted out of a saucerlike base at 727.23 in late February.Intuitive gets a rock-solid 96 Composite Rating in IBD Stock Checkup, among the top 5 in IBD's Medical-Systems/Equipment industry group. That group is ranked No. 1 among 197 industry groups and subgroups for six-month relative price performance.Watch for potential new buy points to emerge, in the form of a new base or a gentle pullback to the 10-week moving average, as seen on a weekly chart.In some cases, a stock may not fall back to the 50-day line but find support at the 10-week line. So it's crucial to study a stock's price action on both the daily and weekly charts.RELATED:The Case For A Future New Bull Market In GoldEarnings Results Today: Chipotle Leads 5 Big Reports After The CloseStock Market Today: Is It Time To Buy Hasbro Now?

Group peer Western Digital (WDC) reports Thursday after close.

The stock stumbled 7% Thursday and 9% early Friday and is now a below-$5 stock. Penney reported quarterly results before Friday's opening bell. Earnings came in almost 130% above the consensus target, but the market didn't seem to care.Penney's adjusted profit was 6 cents a share but part of that was from asset sales. Revenue was slightly softer than expected.Credit-card stocks have held up well despite the weakness in retail. Mastercard (MA) has moved sideways in soft trade in recent sessions, and Visa (V) has shown similar action. Both stocks are near 52-week highs and reported weeks ago.

43,CMG,"In a very busy week for news, stocks rallied solidly. Markets worldwide cheered the results of the first round of France's presidential election. Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Dow stock McDonald's (MCD) hit record highs on earnings, while Intel (INTC) and Starbucks (SBUX) tumbled, with hundreds of other companies reporting.

Starbucks matched profit expectations, but missed on sales amid worries about stalling growth. Starbucks shares undercut a recent buy point intraday Friday, but closed above that level.Software leader Microsoft (MSFT) delivered earnings per share above views for its fiscal third quarter, but sales came in a tad short. Its sales guidance for the June quarter also was below analyst estimates. Microsoft earned 73 cents a share excluding items, up 18% year over year, on adjusted revenue of $23.56 billion, up 6%, in the March quarter. Analysts expected 70 cents and $23.62 billion.

Free cash flow soared to $1.63 billion from $527 million. The aerospace giant raised its full year EPS outlook, but the midpoint still fell below analyst views.

But AT&T shares fell to 2017 low.Separately, cable giant Comcast (CMCSA) rose to a new high on strength in its movie business and broadband-customer gains.Recall costs and slowing U.S. sales hurt Ford (F) earnings, which fell but still beat Q1 views.

Ahead of earnings, Caterpillar finally broke a 51-month streak of falling retail sales, with a 1% gain that was driven by construction equipment sales in the Asia-Pacific region. Caterpillar shares soared into a buy zone.Biotechs and drugmakers reported en masse Thursday with AbbVie (ABBV), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) delivering across-the-board beats, pumping their stocks up that day.

On Thursday, Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR) stock hit an 11-year low on light sales and an 8-cent per-share loss ex items that also missed.Even as the House made another push to repeal ObamaCare — with a plan that included steep cuts for Medicaid — a raft of insurers moved into buy zones, and flirted with breakouts or pushing to new highs. The catalyst was an especially strong earnings report from Anthem (ANTM), though investors may have judged that TrumpCare remains doomed. Humana (HUM) previewed its earnings and raised guidance. Centene (CNC) topped estimates and CEO Michael Neidorff said he expects the Medicaid-heavy insurer to thrive on any reform that can be passed by Congress, noting that ""20 Republican senators come from states that expanded Medicaid.""PulteGroup (PHM) topped earnings estimates, but revenue fell short. Meanwhile, President Trump imposed a 20% tariff on Canadian softwood imports, which could raise construction costs by $1,200 per home. New-home sales rose in March to the second-fastest rate of the current business cycle. Pulte tumbled, but did not outright close below a prior buy point. D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar (LEN) fell below their 50-day lines as well.

44,CMG,"Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Co-Chief Executive Officer Monty Moran is departing the company, leaving founder Steve Ells in sole charge of reviving the embattled burrito chain after a food-safety crisis.Moran, 50, has stepped down as co-CEO and vacated his board seat, the Denver-based company said in a statement Monday. He will retire altogether from Chipotle next year.The move follows a tumultuous year for Chipotle, which suffered a series of foodborne-illness outbreaks in 2015 and then struggled to repair its image. The company renewed investor fears last week when it warned that customer service has slipped, partly because Chipotle has been focused on the crisis. The stock fell almost 8 percent on Tuesday after those remarks.With the turnaround faltering, it was time to make a change, said Michael Halen, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.""The inability to run good restaurants this year is almost mind-boggling,"" he said.Chipotle's board cited operational problems in pushing to have the 51-year-old Ells retake the CEO job alone. He started the company more than 23 years ago and ran it until 2009, when he assumed the shared role with Moran.IBD'S TAKE: While Chipotle struggles, several restaurant stocks have broken out in recent weeks. Check out this IBD Stock Analysis of 2015 IPO Wingstop. ""As the company grew, operations became more complicated and less consistent,"" Neil Flanzraich, lead director of Chipotle's board, said in the statement. ""Given the ongoing challenges facing the company, the board felt strongly that it was best for Steve to resume leadership of the company going forward.""The shares rose 3.3% to 382.36 on the stock market today. Chipotle had slid 23% this year through the end of last week, dogged by the slow recovery from E. coli and norovirus outbreaks last year.Before Moran was hired as co-CEO, he had served for almost four years as chief operating officer. He also worked as general counsel and previously was CEO of the Denver law firm Messner & Reeves LLC.At the time, Ells said that Moran helped bring a ""people culture"" to Chipotle, rather than just a ""food culture."" Ells, a classically trained chef, had created the chain with the aim of bringing higher-quality ingredients and cooking techniques to the fast-food industry.A co-CEO arrangement is often meant to help a company's founder handle a growing business's mechanics. But if Moran was supposed to be the operations guy, it wasn't showing up in recent results, Halen said.Chipotle's workforce hasn't been managed well, he said. In the aftermath of the E. coli crisis, Chipotle kept restaurants fully staffed — despite lower customer traffic — in a bid to maintain its customer service. But the turnaround effort has been lackluster.The restaurant chain said last week that it has now imposed a hiring freeze. It also warned that it was ""nervous"" about meeting its 2017 guidance. In October, Chipotle forecast 2017 earnings of $10 a share.""They kept labor in the restaurants and at the same time operations still deteriorated,"" Halen said. ""They need to make some changes.""Ells said on Monday that he would be focused on improving the company's restaurant teams — and in turn, the dining experience.""While our plans will take some time to implement, we will act with a sense of urgency toward all of the changes we are pursuing,"" he said.Chipotle isn't the only food company to abandon dual-CEO roles this year. Whole Foods Market (WFM) made a similar move last month, putting its co-founder back in sole control of the chain.At Chipotle, Moran's departure may help the company make other management changes, according to John Zolidis, an analyst at Buckingham Research Group. The co-CEOs' pay packages had drawn criticism in the past, and the latest change could free up resources to apply elsewhere.The move ""sets the stage to bring in new individuals and amplify the executive team with a skill set more closely aligned to addressing the company's current issues,"" Zolidis said in a note.RELATED:Chipotle Chief: Service Hampering ComebackDave & Buster's, Panera, Wingstop, Yum Among Restaurants Back On Menu

45,CMG,"To bring back customers following last year's foodborne illness scare, Chipotle has deployed chorizo, better food-safety protocols, promotions, this love story video, and  even a drone pilot program.But customers still appeared squeamish. Traffic at the fast-casual Mexican chain was still disappointing, CNBC reported Tuesday, citing a report from M Science on StreetAccount.Shares closed down 3.4% at 423.02 on the stock market today, after nearly retaking their downward sloping 200-day line Monday for the first time in a year. Meanwhile, Taco Bell parent Yum Brands (YUM) rose 1%, while Qdoba parent Jack In The Box (JACK) fell 1.7%. El Pollo Loco (LOCO) edged up 0.4%, and Del Taco (TACO) dipped 0.3%.Chipotle's stock has tumbled since last year. The broader restaurant sector, meanwhile, has struggled to compete with cheaper groceries, their own competitive value deals and broader consumer anxieties.IBD'S TAKE: Despite restaurant stocks' struggles, shorter-term opportunities do exist. For more see this story  about restaurant stocks, and IBD's column The Short Side. In July, Chipotle said its efforts to bring back customers were paying off and touted its Chiptopia loyalty program, which had attracted more than 3.6 million participants by then.Those efforts, the company said, had helped cushion falling same-store sales that month. For Q2, comp sales still plunged 23.6%, though that was an improvement over Q1's 30% dive.More changes could be coming — activist investor Bill Ackman's Pershing Square in September disclosed a 9.9% stake in the fast-casual chain, prompting speculation on how he might influence the company.RELATED:Do McDonald's Japan Sales Point To 'Pokemon Go' Fatigue?Why The Next Apple Could Come From A Drone Wildcatter

48,CMG,"In 2014, the FAA gave its first approval to commercial drone use on U.S. land, allowing oil major BP (BP) to use AeroVironment (AVAV) drones for aerial surveying in Alaska. Now additional applications in infrastructure, health, marketing, restaurants and entertainment are on the horizon.Utility giant Duke Energy (DUK) last year also conducted tests of AeroVironment's drones to see how they might be used for plant upkeep. And AeroVironment, in an earnings call in June, said it was ""under contract"" with a large U.S. railroad company.Drones could also be used to create Wi-Fi hot spots, and AeroVironment has developed technology that enables encrypted communication, said Steve Gitlin, the company's vice president of marketing strategy, communications and investor relations. The data that drones collect also could make marketing more sophisticated, he told IBD.While Amazon's (AMZN) efforts to develop drones for package delivery are well known by now, restaurants and health care providers see the technology's potential as well.A Domino's Pizza (DPZ) international franchisee recently used a drone to show how pizza could be delivered via the aerial devices. Drones also could eventually be used to deliver medicine and medical supplies, such as defibrillators, to areas that are difficult to access. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) burritos, delivered by drones from Alphabet (GOOGL)? That's actually happening.Farming has been one of the biggest markets for drones, and now companies that provide agricultural services are seeing new opportunities outside farms.GreenSight Agronomics uses drones to gather data on the agricultural health of upper-end properties. CEO James Peverill hopes the company's technology will enable owners of golf courses and similar acreage to more precisely target pesticides vs. more scorched-earth spraying tactics.""These are chemicals that are being applied in kind of a broad sense,"" he said in an interview, ""when in many cases the real problem is fairly localized.""Less utilitarian applications have been suggested as well. In the White House's first workshop on drones, Intel (INTC) CEO Brian Krzanich suggested swarms of drones equipped with multicolored lights could eventually replace fireworks and that the devices, more broadly, could ""change the way we have experiences.""But while drone racing is gaining followers, its prospects in gambling aren't clear yet. Some bookmakers told a writer for Medium this year that they had started to watch drone racing more closely but were reluctant to offer odds just yet.""At this stage, it's a flat-out 'No' for me,"" Johnny Avello, executive director of race and sports operations at Wynn Resorts' (WYNN) Wynn Las Vegas, told IBD.""In order for us to take a wager, we have to look at various aspects,"" he added.

49,CMG,"August's 151,000 job gain missed expectations and slowed from July. But the headline figure still looks decent, or even better for Wall Street because it means the Federal Reserve can take its time before raising interest rates.Yet a look below the surface reveals something entirely different: This was the worst jobs report since 2010.If the data are accurate, the economy is in much worse shape than commonly believed. Yet before going into the ugly details, consider some contrary signals:Since the start of July, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) tellers and Starbucks (SBUX) baristas got a significant bump in pay, while Wendy's (WEN), Ross Stores (ROST), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and others have said in earnings calls that they're paying more as they compete for top talent, incentivize performance and keep up with minimum-wage laws. While these are anecdotal reports, federal taxes withheld from paychecks, the broadest gauge of the health of the job market, are growing at the fastest rate in nine months.Now here's what's wrong with the latest jobs report. The problem isn't primarily that job growth has decelerated, it's that wage gains also slowed and the average workweek is now shorter than at any time since the economy was still getting back on its feet in 2011 (unless you count two blizzard-hit months in the winter of 2013-14 when the workweek was equally short).IBD'S TAKE: Despite what the jobs report says, wages have been trending higher, and that's likely to continue as the economy nears full employment. Investors may want to focus on companies with a strong enough position in their markets to withstand labor inflation without suffering a hit to profit margins. Read this Investor's Corner on profit margins and check out IBD Stock Checkup to see how your investments rate.The most important number in each report isn't the net number of new jobs. It's a number that combines the total number of jobs in the economy, the length of the workweek and the average hourly wage. Here's the shock: Aggregate weekly payrolls, essentially the sum total of private-sector pay earned in a week, grew just 3.5% from a year ago in August, the weakest gain since September 2010. (The 3.5% gain matched the level seen in that unusually stormy December of 2013.)The biggest culprit was the length of the average workweek, which was revised down in July from 34.5 hours to 34.4 hours, then fell to 34.3 hours in August. Here's what that means when combined with the modest deceleration in job creation: The total number of hours worked in the economy rose just 1.1% from a year ago, the smallest increase since July 2010. By comparison, total hours worked have grown at least 2.3% vs. a year ago in each of the past five years' August jobs reports.Meanwhile, after average hourly wages grew just 0.1% in August, the annual rate of increase slowed from an upwardly revised 2.7% in July to just 2.4% last month.Despite the added jobs, the paltry wage growth last month and the drop in hours meant that aggregate pay fell 0.2% in August from July.The bottom line is that, if these details reflect reality, the purchasing power of American consumers has gotten pinched. That could help explain why fast-food chains like McDonald's (MCD) have seen sales growth slow, while retailers like Target (TGT) saw a decline in same-store sales. It's also possible that companies facing margin pressures amid tough competition and higher wages have curtailed work hours.Still, the Labor Department data are subject to revision, unlike the tax data that are signaling a faster rise in aggregate pay, so it doesn't make sense to jump to negative conclusions.RELATED:Slower August Job Growth Will Keep The Fed On Hold In SeptemberAs Companies Step Up Wage Hikes, Tax Receipts Get A Lift

50,CMG,"Restaurant Brands International (QSR) on Thursday reported a drop in same-restaurant sales at Burger King's U.S. and Canada locations for the first time in some three years, an analyst noted, as restaurants nationwide struggle with deepening customer anxieties.But the fast-food giant said it remained confident about its direction and didn't offer much commentary about the state of the consumer.McDonald's (MCD) and Starbucks (SBUX) have described uncertainties stemming from global upheaval, high-profile shootings, terrorist attacks and a chaotic election season. But Restaurant Brands wasn't as introspective, with management noting increased competition and repeating the common refrain of a challenging environment.""The industry changes from time to time,"" CEO Daniel Schwartz said on the company's earnings call. ""We try to get too focused on macroeconomic changes.""Same-restaurant sales growth at Burger King locations in the U.S. and Canada fell 0.8%. The last time comps in that region fell into negative territory was 2013, Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh said in a research note.With the exception of Burger King's Asia-Pacific regions, comps slowed across the board for Burger King and Tim Hortons, which Restaurant Brands also owns.Overall, same-restaurant sales at Burger King rose 0.6%, slowing considerably from 6.7% growth a year earlier. Comps at Tim Hortons slowed to 2.7% from 5.5% growth.Top- and bottom-line results were mixed during the second quarter. Total revenue edged down to $1.04 billion, compared to analysts' expectations for $1.043 billion. The stronger U.S. dollar weighed on revenue. Earnings per share rose 38% to 41 cents, topping estimates for 34 cents.Restaurant Brands shares closed up 3.4% at 46.31 in the stock market today, just above buy territory after breaking out last month. McDonald's edged up 0.7%, and Starbucks lost 0.9%. Jack In The Box (JACK), which reported strong quarterly results late Wednesday, jumped 10.6%. Wendy's (WEN) added 2%.IBD'S TAKE: Competitive discounting, potential overexpansion and consumer unease have hurt sales across much of the restaurant sector. However, Restaurant Brands' stock is one of the few in the sector to stay above its key 50-day line. Compare and contrast industry players at IBD's Stock Checkup.Restaurant Brands has tried to shift toward more of a franchisee-led model, which shifts more expenses from corporate onto independent restaurant operators.While fast-casual rival Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) has tried to keep its menu simple, Restaurant Brands has in recent months has tried to brighten up its offering with occasional new products. Tim Hortons has launched iced coffee drinks and steak sandwiches. Burger King, meanwhile, has introduced grilled hot dogs and and Mac n' Cheetos.

The stock market came under more pressure as Apple (AAPL) reported its first sales decline since 2003, while Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN) turned on the gas. The Federal Reserve signaled it's in no rush to raise rates, while the U.S. economy crawls.The market rally came under more pressure amid a slew of earnings reports and big economic news. The Nasdaq tumbled 2.7% for the week, falling through its 200-day line on Thursday and its 50-day average on Friday, as losers such as Apple, Twitter (TWTR) and First Solar (FSLR) trumped big gains for Facebook and Amazon. The S&P 500 and Dow are well above those support levels, but also tumbled, with all of the losses coming Thursday-Friday. Oil prices continued to march higher, helped by a weaker dollar and further declines in U.S. production. The 10-year Treasury yield gave up much of its recent gains.How healthy are shares of Amazon and Facebook, and how do they compare to rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupThe tech titan certainly wasn't a growth company in its fiscal second quarter, reporting its first revenue decline since 2003 as iPhone unit sales tumbled. Earnings per share fell 18%, worse than expected. And Apple gave weak guidance for the current quarter. Apple hasn't had a huge product since the big-screen iPhone 6, and smartphone sales generally are stagnating. At this point Apple is so huge it will be hard for a new product to really move the needle.In another sign of its shift from rapid growth to a more mature model, Apple added an additional $50 billion to its shareholder return program, with more buybacks and a higher dividend.Meanwhile, activist investor Carl Icahn decided to cash out of Apple stock, and so did others.

The Fed noted that labor markets have strengthened even as economic growth slowed. And that's true, for now. The U.S. economy rose at a 0.5% annual rate in the first quarter, the weakest in two years. Meanwhile, jobless claims are near 42-year lows. If the economy is barely growing, it's hard to see how the U.S. can continue to add 200,000 jobs a month. But that's what analysts are expecting in Friday's April employment report.The Fed's go-slow approach -- coupled with the Bank of Japan's unexpected decision not to increase its stimulus efforts -- pushed the dollar to big losses.

57,CMG,"Chipotle Mexican Grill's (CMG) move to trademark ""Better Burger"" didn't just signal a possible new burger chain. It also underscores that Chipotle's core business may have peaked.Chipotle is just starting to recover from a slew of E. coli and norovirus outbreaks at several of its restaurants late last year, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ending its investigation on Feb. 1. Same-store sales plunged 14.6% in the fourth quarter and were down 26% in February. Chipotle has predicted it would report its first-ever quarterly loss in Q1.The burrito giant should see a rebound in sales from depressed levels. Consumer sentiment regarding Chipotle bottomed in January, according to William Blair analyst Sharon Zackfia on Friday, citing her survey  of 800 adults. But while Chipotle's stock also bottomed in January, it hasn't made much of a recovery.IBD's Take: How Healthy Is Chipotle's stock and how does it stack up vs. rivals?But Chipotle's growth was decelerating rapidly, even before the food illness outbreaks. And other industry data also suggest that demand for Mexican food generally is no longer outpacing other types of cuisine.Chipotle is the king of fast casual eateries, as well as the clear leader among similar Tex-Mex chains, such as Jack In The Box (JACK)-owned Qdoba Mexican Eats, privately owned Freebirds World Burrito and more.But the Mexican restaurant sector is maturing, while upscale burger chains are growing in popularity, according to market tracking firm Technomic's President Darren Tristano.""When we looked at the market in 2015, sales in the (upscale) 'better burger' category grew 15%. Mexican slowed down to only 7% or 8%,"" he told IBD. Mexican restaurant growth had also been in the double digits.Take a look at the figures for high-flying burger chain Shake Shack (SHAK). There, sales rose 47%, but that was just $51 million compared with Chipotle's revenue at just under $1 billion in the fourth quarter.Chipotle needs to continue diversifying to grow, Tristano said.""When you have such large sales growth, it has to slow down. We saw that with a lot of other fast casuals too,"" he said.Sandwich and bakery chain Panera Bread (PNRA) used to enjoy double-digit and then high-single-digit same-store growth. But in the fourth quarter, that was reduced to 3.4%.It's not surprising that Chipotle's growth has faltered, but what is astounding is that it stayed so high for so long. In the fourth quarter of 2013, Chipotle's same-store sales rose a robust 9.3% vs. a year earlier. But comparable growth then accelerated every quarter until it peaked at 19.8% in the third quarter of 2014.""It was just getting bigger and bigger a few years ago,"" Argus Research analyst John Staszak said. ""Comparisons were getting more difficult.""Same-store sales growth cooled to 16.1% in Q4 2014, then to 10.4%, 4.3% and 2.6% in the first three quarters of 2015, respectively. Some of that was due to carnitas shortages as the company sought more humane suppliers.Another factor to consider is that Chipotle's food-illness woes haven't necessarily helped rivals. Jack-In-The-Box's Qdoba reported same-store sales growth slowed to 1.8% in its latest quarter, down from 14% a year earlier.Total U.S. Mexican restaurant sales grew at a 2.9% annual rate from 2010 to 2015, when they reached $38 billion, IBISWorld said in a report. The market tracker forecasts growth will slow to 2.5% a year for the 2015-2020 period.Further, Chipotle and its peers are losing ground when it comes to satisfying the public's appetite for hotter cuisines. Diners still love spicy foods, but that's expanded beyond Mexican and Asian dishes to fare such as KFC's spicy chicken wings and Restaurant Brands International (QSR)-owned Burger King's ""Angriest Whopper,"" which features hot sauce in the bun.""People looking for spicy foods might be headed for a Mexican restaurant, but there are many other choices for Americans now,"" Tristano said.Chipotle has already expanded into the Asian food sector with its ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen restaurants, though it hasn't rapidly increased those locations. It's dipped its toe into the fast-growing custom pizza sector by investing in the Locale pizzeria chain.Despite slowing growth, analysts are still bullish on Chipotle.""There is still strong association with the Chipotle brand. People have very short memories"" for health scares, said Bonnie Riggs, restaurant analyst for market-tracking firm NPD Group.In addition to eyeing the high-end burger sector, Chipotle at the end of March began testing an expanded drinks menu at a store in its home city of Denver as another way to regain customers and boost same-store sales and margins. Some analysts still see an opportunity to expand into breakfast.And the biggest mid-term source of growth is simply creating more Chipotle locations. The company added 192 stores in 2014 and 229 locations in 2015, with 220-235 planned in 2016.Investors can take heart, however. A restaurant operator that is maturing doesn't necessarily mean a death knell for the stock. Investors can, and usually do, reset expectations.Take a look at Panera, which is trading at-all time highs. There's also the fast-food king, McDonald's (MCD), which has rebounded to record highs, largely over excitement that U.S. same-store sales have turned positive following a long slump.And don't forget that expanding into burgers would bring some symmetry to Chipotle's story. McDonald's, home of the Big Mac, was a big Chipotle investor before divesting its stake.

58,CMG,"Small-cap stock ETFs surged into the close Tuesday as worries mount about the decline in S&P 500 earnings growth.Investors kept stocks tightly reined as a two-day Federal Reserve policy meeting got under way and earnings entered peak season.Tuesday's banner report came via Apple (AAPL) after the close. The iPhone maker's results came in below analyst expectations. Its fiscal Q2 results missed on both the top and bottom lines, and iPhone sales fell 16% to 51.2 million. Apple stock swooned in after-hours trade, as did Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) on its own earnings news.Wall Street's consensus is more upbeat on social networker Facebook (FB) and e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN).

59,CMG,"While much of the media attention in the restaurant industry has focused on the McDonald’s (MCD) financial rebound and Chipotle Mexican Grill’s (CMG) food safety problems, drive-in chain Sonic (SONC) has quietly become one of the sector’s top performers on Wall Street.The company’s shares are up about 7% since the beginning of the year and have risen more than 35% since Feb. 10. In comparison, IBD’s Retail-Restaurant group as a whole has risen about 4% since the beginning of the year and 9% since Feb. 10.Sonic’s stock touched a 52-week high of 36.34 on April 6. The high capped a rally that began a week earlier, when the company beat fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue views and logged a 6.5% annual gain in same-restaurant sales, or at outlets open more than a year. The latter increase was especially impressive, considering that it came on top of an even bigger gain during the previous year’s second quarter.""The clear highlight of the quarter was a better-than-expected systemwide comp of 6.5% against a difficult 11.5% comparison, easily ahead of our estimate of 3% to 4% and consensus of roughly 1.5%,"" William Blair analyst Sharon Zackfia wrote in a research note.Sonic reported results after the close on March 29. The next day, its stock price popped 6%.It was a welcome reaction for a company that has largely flown under the radar in the restaurant sector. Most of the attention has focused on rebounding fast-food stocks such as McDonald’s, Taco Bell parent Yum Brands (YUM) and Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR), as well as flailing fast-casual chains like Chipotle, Shake Shack (SHAK) and Habit Restaurants (HABT).McDonald’s has benefited from successful initiatives such as its all-day breakfast menu and its ""McPick 2 for $5"" promotional deal. Meanwhile, Chipotle continues to feel the fallout from the E. coli and norovirus outbreaks at several of its restaurants.Sonic operates in a kind of middle ground between fast food and fast casual. Like fast-food chains, it focuses on quick service. The main difference is that at some Sonic restaurants, you can have carhops on roller skates deliver your food to your car.Like fast-casual restaurants, Sonic specializes in fresh, made-to-order fare that includes burgers, hot dogs, toaster sandwiches, burritos and various breakfast and side items. It has more than 3,500 locations in 45 states, making it the nation’s largest chain of drive-in restaurants. The drive-in concept separates it from other quick-service restaurant (QSR) brands like McDonald’s, Burger King and Wendy’s (WEN), which offer drive-through but not drive-in service.""Sonic represents one of the most highly differentiated QSR brands in the country with a fun, 'retro-future' look that breaks through the clutter in a crowded QSR segment,"" Jefferies analyst Alexander Slagle noted in a report.Another way in which Sonic differentiates itself is its technology focus. Over the past couple of years, the company has invested heavily in new Point-Of-Service (POS) and Point-Of-Personalized-Service (POPS) platforms, while other chains have focused more on mobile apps.Sonic’s POS platform is designed to improve the order process, cut food and packaging costs, reduce employee waste and theft, and optimize labor so the right amount of staff is on hand at the right time. The POPS platform lets Sonic tailor offers to customers based on their past purchasing history. It also provides on-site redeemable offers to customers.At the end of the second quarter, the POPS platform was in 1,616 locations and was about halfway through its rollout, Zackfia noted. The rollout should be finished by the end of the 2017 calendar year.""POPS will facilitate technology and social media initiatives (and) allow for uniquely personalized engagement that we anticipate will be a key driver of future same-store sales momentum, including the systemwide rollout of a mobile app that includes mobile payment,"" Zackfia said.Although Sonic’s heavy investment in technology has cut into the company’s bottom line, most analysts reckon that it will pay off in the long run.""While some investors might have hoped for a little better flow-through to the bottom line given the (same-restaurant sales) upside, the team appears to be making the appropriate investments in the business to continue generating market share gains in the future,"" Slagle noted.Sonic officials have a similar take. On a second-quarter conference call with analysts, Chief Executive Clifford Hudson said the company’s POS and POPS investments provide an ""opportunity to leverage this technology and enhance the customer experience in a way that competitor brands can’t.""Even with rising technology costs in recent years, Sonic has done pretty well on the earnings front. It has logged 11 straight quarters of double-digit EPS growth.Earnings came in at 18 cents a share during the fiscal second quarter, which ended Feb. 29. That was up 38% from the prior year and two cents ahead of consensus. Revenue rose 5% to $133.2 million, also topping estimates.Sonic raised its full-year same-store sales growth estimate to a range of 4% to 6% vs. prior guidance of 2% to 4%.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Sonic to post earnings of $1.36 a share for the entire fiscal year, which ends in August. That would represent a 24% year-over-year gain. Earnings are seen rising another 14% in fiscal 2017.

The S&P 500 etched a 0.1% loss, and the Dow industrials held to an even narrower decline.Volume was mixed on the stock market today, down 14% on the NYSE but 2% higher on the Nasdaq, relative to action at the same time Wednesday.A sharp drop in jobless claims -- to their lowest mark since 1973 -- and a weaker than-expected rise in consumer price data gave stocks some positive early input. Overseas, a surprise devaluation of currency by Singapore's central bank sent other Asian currencies broadly lower. The fall in the yen sent Tokyo's Nikkei 225 soaring 3.2%. China's markets ended narrowly higher. In Europe, eurozone markets traded moderately higher, while London's FTSE 100 lagged, down 0.1% near midday.The Dow opened in a fairly balanced stance.

65,CMG,"They're two fast-food staples with two different stock patterns. McDonald's (MCD), benefiting from its new All Day Breakfast service, was close to a possible breakout from a cup base. Meanwhile, Starbucks (SBUX) is trying to claw its way out of a five-month consolidation but ended the week strong.""Given the 'fast money' playing MCD currently, we understand why maybe SBUX has underperformed,"" Jefferies said in a research note last week. But the investment firm noted that the valuation gap -- based on forward PE multiples -- between the two stocks is relatively small compared to recent years. Either way, here's a look at their charts.McDonald's, which has a buy point of 124.93, closed up 0.75% at 124.08 on Friday. The stock began its base in February. Shares dipped and wrapped around their key 50-day line through March 8 in mostly lower-than-average volume. They began climbing on March 9.Breakouts with higher-than-average volume are ideal. The base is second-stage. The earlier the stage, the likelier the stock is to still have something in the tank for future gains.Outside technicals, things look bright for the company's current quarter. A year prior, the stock suffered amid concerns that the fast-food giant wasn't adapting to a restaurant landscape that seemed to focus on healthy and fast-casual.But the fried-food behemoth seems to have eased those concerns by doubling down on what it already does, with its all-day breakfast service, launched last year, and value options helping push results higher. And investors, for now, have soured on fast-casual as more restaurants tried to cash in on the trend and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) tries to pick up the pieces following food-borne illness scares.""We believe business materially improved in Feb. as the company began re-emphasizing All Day Breakfast, weather was more favorable across the U.S., and the McPick campaign shifted to a '2 for $5' price point, which better combatted the other value-based meal platforms in the QSR (quick-service restaurant) space,"" Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh said in a research note this week.""We also think that this momentum has continued into March, and, were it to continue throughout the month, we believe the quarter’s results could prove our estimates conservative,"" he added.McDonald's stock rose from a flat base in October, and strong quarterly results have driven its 32% ascent since 2015.Stock action for Starbucks, the chain that has given Americans a reason to drink coffee at any time of the day, hasn’t been as healthy. The stock’s 50-day line has come close to slicing through its 200-day line, a bearish sign.Shares have closed up five out of the last six sessions and rose 0.25% at 59.70 on Friday in heavy volume, an encouraging sign after prior gains in weak volume. But they have a way to go before clearing the Oct. 30 record high of 64.""We suspect high expectations and strong performance in 2015 ... has not been a good recipe so far in ’16,"" Jefferies said in a research note last week.The company’s investments could more than double this year, following additional spending on higher wages in Q1, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said in a note last week.""This reinvestment, together with ongoing technology initiatives, delivery testing and FX drag ($0.05/share or 3pp headwind), may limit FY16 EPS growth to 18-20%,"" Palmer said. He added: ""However, we believe these investment areas are protecting the brand from the risks that befall many larger brands as Starbucks captures scale advantages through technology.""Mobile payments, one of those technology initiatives, accounted for 21% of orders last quarter, RBC said, and may have gained ""to the mid-20% range in the current quarter.""

66,CMG,"Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) moved lower Thursday after an analyst downgraded the troubled burrito chain’s stock, saying its turnaround efforts will take “much longer than expected and be more costly.”Jefferies analyst Andy Barish downgraded Chipotle to underperform from hold and lowered his price target on the stock to 350 from 390, in a research note published Thursday.Barish said Chipotle’s recovery from food safety issues at its restaurants -- including E. coli and norovirus outbreaks that affected employees and customers alike -- is “unprecedented in today's world of instant social media.”Those issues are particularly problematic for a company that has long boasted about its “Food with Integrity,” Barish wrote. “Fickle millennial consumers who can love a brand for its ‘Food with Integrity’ ... will quickly (and maybe permanently) depart for newer concepts when that integrity is questioned. Our proprietary survey work in recent weeks reinforces this view.”He also says Chipotle’s ability to ramp up same-store sales and per-share earnings will be slower than originally expected, and that its margins will come under pressure amid higher food and labor costs associated with the company’s new food safety programs.Chipotle has also been giving out a slew of free burrito coupons.Chipotle shares fell 5.75% to 471.59 on the stock market today, closing below the 50-day moving average.Despite all the attention on Chipotle, it's a fallen stock leader, rating 41st out of IBD's Retail-Restaurant industry group. Click on IBD's Stock Checkup to see Chipotle's detailed ratings -- and which eateries are at the top of the menu.On Tuesday, Chipotle said its same-store sales in February fell 26% from the prior year, which was worse than most analyst estimates.

78,CMG,"McDonald’s (MCD) took over the top spot from Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) as the favorite restaurant destination among U.S. teens and young adults in 2015, according to a new poll released Wednesday, with the burger giant benefiting from a rebound in the quick-service sector.Meanwhile, Starbucks (SBUX) remained a pretty popular destination among female respondents -- though less so than in previous years -- while Yum Brands’ (YUM) Taco Bell was a hit with young males.William Blair’s annual Teen/Young Adult Survey found that restaurant sentiment “weakened somewhat” in 2015, with about 43% of respondents saying they ate out more often than a year earlier vs. 48% in 2014. Still, those numbers compared well to the apparel category, where only 31% of respondents said they spent more on apparel in 2015.“For those eating out less often, financial reasons were by far the main culprit (40%), while the response ‘too expensive’ jumped to roughly 25% from 18% last year, perhaps reflecting push-back to price increases taken by restaurants on structural government-mandated wage inflation,” William Blair analyst Sharon Zackfia said in a report.She said the quick-service sector “had a quantum leap in popularity” in 2015. Eateries in this category accounted for 38% of total restaurant visits by respondents in 2015, up from 30% in 2014. This represented an all-time high for the survey, driven by strong share gains from McDonald’s and Taco Bell.Fast-casual visits fell to about 20% of total visits in 2015 from 28% the prior year, and Chipotle lost the biggest chunk of share. That was the case even though the survey was completed before the E. coli outbreak at Chipotle restaurants, which was first reported in the fall. Casual dining surpassed fast casual to become the second-most-frequented subsector in 2015.“In terms of frequency (of visits), McDonald’s topped the list across genders, while Chipotle fell to second among females (from first the prior year) and third among males (from second the prior year),” Zackfia said.Among female respondents, Panera Bread (PNRA) held the third spot behind McDonald’s and Chipotle for the second year in a row. Starbucks remained in fourth place, though the percentage of female respondents who said they ate there most often fell to 6.3% in 2015 from 7.2% in 2014. Darden Restaurants' (DRI) Olive Garden rounded out the top five among females.“McDonald’s gained material share over the past year across both genders, with the second-highest share gains behind Olive Garden for females and Taco Bell for males,” Zackfia noted.Among male respondents, Taco Bell ranked second behind McDonald’s as the most-visited restaurant. It was followed by Chipotle, DineEquity’s (DIN) Applebee’s and Wendy’s (WEN).Shares of McDonald’s closed down 0.3% on the stock market today.Chipotle rose 3.1%, Starbucks lost 0.8%, Yum fell 1%, Panera fell fractionally, Darden and  Dinequity climbed 0.7%, and Wendy’s retreated 0.4%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

A year earlier, company comps jumped 12.7%, and franchise comps saw a 12.4% increase.The restaurant chain also said it will stop reporting quarter-to-date comps trends after this quarter, ""as a four-week trend is not predictive of quarterly same-store sales.""The chicken-wing purveyor targeted 2016 earnings per share of $5.95-$6.20, well below forecasts for $6.48.Q4 EPS climbed 23.4% to $1.32, but that was short of views for $1.48.

The company has also been dealing with higher labor costs, which jumped 20% from a year earlier.The results come as the company awaits the results of an investigation by health officials in Kansas into reports of gastrointestinal illness potentially linked to one of its restaurants there. At least 10 were reported sick, media outlets said, with the first reports coming Friday.Buffalo Wild Wings said it shut down the restaurant in question, had it cleaned, and then on Sunday reopened it, according to Bloomberg.The test results could come in a matter of days, potentially around the Super Bowl, possibly costing the chain one of its biggest sales days of the year. Last year, the company sold some 11 million chicken wings on Super Bowl Sunday.The results follow Tuesday’s quarterly report from Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), whose reputation, profits and stock price have all been battered by foodborne-illness outbreaks reported last year. Chipotle said Tuesday that 2016 will be ""very difficult"" and gave a break-even profit forecast for Q1. Sales aren't seen recovering until next year.Yum Brands, whose own food-handling issues in recent years preceded a planned spinoff of its China business, reported Q4 EPS Wednesday that topped views, though its sales missed.China sales rose 7%, with same-restaurant sales up 2%, marking the second straight gain and indicating a continued recovery from the food-safety issues.Overall, Yum's adjusted EPS rose 11% to 68 cents, beating by 2 cents. Revenue declined 1.2% to $3.95 billion, missing views of $4.02 billion.Yum shares slipped 1.4% in late trading.

A year earlier, company comps jumped 12.7%, and franchise comps saw a 12.4% increase.The restaurant chain also said it will stop reporting quarter-to-date comps trends after this quarter, ""as a four-week trend is not predictive of quarterly same-store sales.""The chicken-wing purveyor targeted 2016 earnings per share of $5.95-$6.20, well below forecasts for $6.48.Q4 EPS climbed 23.4% to $1.32, but that was short of views for $1.48. Sales rose 19.9% to $490.2 million, missing estimates for $507.23 million.Shares were up 1% in after-hours trading, after initially falling 2% late and having closed 4.3% lower on reports of diners in Kansas getting sick.Overall comps rose 1.9% at company-owned restaurants and 0.1% at franchised locations during Q4, short of the company's own expectations.Buffalo Wild Wings said the sluggish performance was likely due to ""holiday shifts for Halloween and Christmas."" The company has also been dealing with higher labor costs, which jumped 20% from a year earlier.The results come as the company awaits the results of an investigation by health officials in Kansas into reports of gastrointestinal illness potentially linked to one of its restaurants there. At least 10 were reported sick, media outlets said, with the first reports coming Friday.Buffalo Wild Wings said it shut down the restaurant in question, had it cleaned, and then on Sunday reopened it, according to Bloomberg.The test results could come in a matter of days, potentially around the Super Bowl, possibly costing the chain one of its biggest sales days of the year. Last year, the company sold some 11 million chicken wings on Super Bowl Sunday.The results follow Tuesday’s quarterly report from Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), whose reputation, profits and stock price have all been battered by foodborne-illness outbreaks reported last year. Chipotle said Tuesday that 2016 will be ""very difficult"" and gave a break-even profit forecast for Q1. Sales aren't seen recovering until next year.Yum Brands, whose own food-handling issues in recent years preceded a planned spinoff of its China business, reported Q4 EPS Wednesday that topped views, though its sales missed.China sales rose 7%, with same-restaurant sales up 2%, marking the second straight gain and indicating a continued recovery from the food-safety issues.Overall, Yum's adjusted EPS rose 11% to 68 cents, beating by 2 cents. Revenue declined 1.2% to $3.95 billion, missing views of $4.02 billion.Yum shares slipped 1.4% in late trading.

82,CMG,"Investors in $13.9 billion JPMorgan Large Cap Growth Fund (SEEGX) are a little like a cruise ship passenger who falls overboard in a typhoon.None of them would dream of trying to cross an ocean by clinging to a life preserver. But in the current market storm, those investors are no doubt glad to have hold of something that stays afloat.Their life preserver comes in the form of stocks like Reynolds American (RAI). The tobacco company is up 8% so far this year. That makes it one of only about a dozen stocks out of 66 in the portfolio that have gained ground so far in this volatile year.Reynolds American is a defensive stock in a mutual fund whose main focus is growth. Reynolds also an IBD Leaderboard stock carrying a 99 Composite Rating.The Composite Rating combines IBD’s five stock-performance ratings, including EPS and RS Ratings, with 99 being the highest.Information technology was the fund's largest sector as of Jan. 31, with a 37.5% weighting. Consumer staples, like Reynolds, accounted for only 8.1% of the portfolio. Yet Reynolds' 3.4% dividend yield and recently steady sales growth -- 41% and 43% the past two quarters -- make it a safe haven at a time when investors are concerned about the pace of global and U.S. economic growth and its impact on earnings growth of more economically sensitive growth companies.Reynolds is in a buy range from a 49.66 buy point after reclaiming the entry Monday in light volume. It cleared the buy point Jan. 29 in lukewarm volume.Tech, consumer discretionary and health-care stocks -- the fund's three top sectors -- are where manager Giri Devulapally had the fund's largest weightings going into this year.Facebook (FB) is one of those tech names. The social media giant is ahead 2% this year and 10% off its all-time high reached early this month.Sporting a 99 Comp Rating, Facebook's earnings per share grew 16%, 33% and 46% the past three quarters. Facebook was the fund's top holding as of Jan. 31.Restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is up 10% this year. But it is still 31% off its Oct. 13 high of 757. The stock has a weak 65 Comp Rating.Revenue fell 7% in the latest quarter. That was the first decline after 11 straight quarters of double-digit growth.On Tuesday, Deutsche Bank analysts cut their rating on the stock to sell from hold. They cited the impact of customer health problems and steps the company has taken to boost food safety.Among other holdings, credit-card payment processor Vantiv (VNTV) is up 8% this year. The stock is working on a deep cup base and trading about 4% below a 53.56 entry.Sales growth has slowed for three quarters. But EPS growth has accelerated for three quarters. The stock has a strong 98 Comp Rating.The company’s recent fourth-quarter report topped analysts’ expectations for a fifth straight frame.The fund fell 9.29% in the past the 12 months going into Tuesday vs. an 8.87% setback by its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. The S&P 500 was down 5.82%.Over the past three years, the fund's average annual gain was 10.84% vs. 10.12% for its peer group and 10.98% by the big-cap bogey.Image provided by Shutterstock.

88,CMG,"Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) topped Wall Street's meek earnings expectations late Tuesday as the restaurant chain released its first quarterly report since being rocked food-safety scandals, but revenue still fell short and the trendy eatery warned that 2016 will be difficult.The company earned $2.17 per share, a 43.5% plummet but not as bad as analysts had feared. Wall Street had anticipated $1.85 per share, and Chipotle had recently guided for diluted EPS of $1.70-$1.90.Revenue fell almost 7% to $997.5 million, below views for $1.01 billion.Same-store sales fell 14.6%, in line with the expected decline Chipotle Mexican Grill had disclosed in a recent SEC filing. Chipotle also announced a $300 million stock buyback program.But  Chipotle warned on the post-earnings call that 2016 ""will be a very difficult year,"" predicting first-quarter EPS will be breakeven. Wall Street had expected $2.08 a share, down 46%. January same-store sales crashed 36%.Shares fell 3.6% to 458.21 on the stock market today in late morning trade.Chipotle's caution of a deeper and longer road to recovery surprised investors, but it follows a similar experience by Yum Brands (YUM). Yum Brands' China operations suffered a a series of food-safety scandals, and same-store sales remain under pressure several quarters later.For 2016, Chipotle expects 220-235 new restaurant openings and an effective full-year tax rate of about 39%. In a December filing, the company rescinded its previously announced 2016 outlook for same-restaurant sales growth.Chipotle's food-safety woes first came to light in early November, prompting the fast-casual burrito chain to temporarily close 43 locations in the Pacific Northwest. Over 50 people in nine states were hit with E. coli.But that wasn't the only scare. In December, over 140 people were struck with norovirus after visiting a single Chipotle restaurant in Boston, and the company was also served with a subpoena related to an earlier norovirus episode at a California location.The company also disclosed that on Jan. 28 it had been served with a subpoena ""broadening the scope of the previously-announced criminal investigation by the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Central District of California.”""The new subpoena requires us to produce documents and information related to company-wide food safety matters dating back to January 1, 2013, and supersedes the subpoena served in December 2015 that was limited to a single Chipotle restaurant in Simi Valley, California,” said the company. “We intend to fully cooperate in the investigation.""But the CDC declared on Monday that the outbreaks were over. Chipotle management had already predicted that margins and earnings this year would be ""messy,"" given the situation.It has since implemented a new food-safety program as it focuses on winning back customers, though young people don't appear to be fazed the restaurant's problems. A NPD Group study, released Monday, said that young adults increased their visits to Chipotle by double-digits last year.""We are pleased to have this behind us and can place our full energies to implementing our enhanced food safety plan that will establish Chipotle as an industry leader in food safety,"" said co-CEO Steve Ells in a statement. ""We are extremely focused on executing this program, which designs layers of redundancy and enhanced safety measures to reduce the food safety risk to a level as near to zero as is possible.""Meanwhile, Buffalo Wild Wings tumbled 6.2% Wednesday intraday  as reports circulated of a Kansas location sickening several people. Buffalo Wild Wings is set to report earnings after the market close. Yum Brands also reports tonight.RELATED:Chipotle Profit Seen Plunging, But Young People Step Up VisitsChipotle Sees ‘Messy’ Year, Plans Redemption

90,CMG,"While Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) continues to deal with the fallout from E. coli and norovirus outbreaks at many of its restaurants, other companies that sell prepared food — including health food grocer Whole Foods Market (WFM) — have an opportunity to pick up new business.That's the finding from RBC Capital Markets analyst William Kirk, who said in a note to clients Wednesday that Chipotle’s food safety concerns “represent a $933 million revenue opportunity for competitors.” For Whole Foods, much of that opportunity involves attracting ex-Chipotle customers in the immediate area.In addition to groceries, Whole Foods also sells prepared items such as sandwiches, salads and sushi. About half its locations have a Chipotle within one mile, Kirk said. Nearly 85% of Whole Foods locations are within three miles of a Chipotle.Kirk reckons that Whole Foods can capture 25% of Chipotle’s lost sales when a store is located within a mile. That percentage falls to 10% for stores located within one to three miles, and 3% for those located within three to five miles.“Put another way, we have Whole Foods’ opportunity as about 3% of lost Chipotle sales,” Kirk said.He estimates Whole Foods can add $31 million in sales from former Chipotle customers — a drop in the bucket when you consider the company logged nearly $16 billion in revenue last fiscal year. But those sales could grow exponentially in future years, giving Whole Foods a little extra defense against rising competition from mainstream supermarket chains like Kroger (KR).“Conventional grocers have been a major headwind to comparable store sales (at Whole Foods),” Kirk noted.Shares of Whole Foods closed down 0.3% in the stock market today. The stock has fallen about 45% over the past year. Chipotle's stock price fell 1.9% while Kroger lost 0.2%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

Other places that made the list are Utah markets Ogden and Salt Lake City, along with Omaha, Neb., and Boise, Idaho.To determine which markets would be hot, Zillow looked at home value appreciation, low unemployment rates and strong income growth.""Trendy tech centers like San Francisco, Seattle and Denver hogged the spotlight in 2015,"" noted Zillow Chief Economist Svenja Gudell in the report. ""But this year, the markets that shine brightest will be those that manage to strike a good balance between strong income growth, low unemployment and solid home value appreciation.

Industrial production has also been weak, and the strong dollar has hit exporters.David Kostin, Goldman Sachs' chief U.S. equity analyst, came up with the recommendations for recession stocks on the assumption that strong balance sheets and high domestics sales should outperform in a downturn, according to Bloomberg.In addition to Facebook, Starbucks and Visa, Goldman also named Alphabet (GOOGL,), Whole Foods Market (WFM), which continues to benefit from the trend in the U.S. toward healthy food, industrial giant 3M (MMM) and Verizon Communications (VZ), the top wireless service provider.Facebook closed up 0.3% on the stock market today.

"
142,CMG,"The recent E. coli outbreak at dozens of Chipotle restaurants was enough to give the whole restaurant sector indigestion, considering that Chipotle had been one of the industry's leading lights earlier in the year. Even before the E. coli news hit, though, Chipotle and other fast-casual chains were falling out of favor on Wall Street.

143,CMG,"""It's been a tough market for high-beta restaurant stocks,"" Cowen & Co. analyst Andrew Charles told IBD.

Zoe's, Fiesta, El Pollo Loco and Habit logged decelerating comp growth during the first three quarters of the year.

Its year-over-year comps grew 11.7% during the first quarter, 12.9% during the second, and 17.1% during the third. Even so, Shake Shack shares are down 58% from their high of 96.75, set in May.
"
156,CMG,"All of the fast-casual players have faced rising competition — not just from each other, but also from privately held chains and small local and regional operations looking to hop on the fast-casual bandwagon.
"
157,CMG,"""It's a very fragmented industry,"" Cowen's Charles said. ""There's not just one player you have to worry about, but many different types of players.""
"
158,CMG,"Competition doesn't come just from other fast-casual chains, either. Darren Tristano, president of Technomic, a research and consulting firm, points out that some companies face increased competition from chains that don't fall under the fast-casual umbrella.
"
159,CMG,"Panera Faces Bakery Rivals
"
160,CMG,"""There are a number of menu categories that are starting to see some maturity, including bakery cafes,"" Tristano told IBD. ""Panera is the leader in the bakery cafe segment. It's not only seeing competition from other fast-casual chains, but also from Starbucks and drive-through chains like Dunkin' Brands (DNKN). A lot of fast-food players are really pushing the convenience of drive-through.""
"
161,CMG,"Companies that focus on more narrow niches should fare better. Tristano points to Zoe's, which specializes in healthier Mediterranean dishes.
"
162,CMG,"""That's a good category where there's not a lot of competition and plenty of room to grow,"" Tristano said.
"
163,CMG,"Chipotle Pain, Qdoba Gain?
"
164,CMG,"The Mexican category is ""still dominated by Chipotle,"" Tristano said, though he added that Qdoba Mexican Eats, owned by Jack in the Box (JACK), is continuing to grow in a lot of markets where it overlaps with Chipotle.
"
165,CMG,"The wild card is how Chipotle's E. coli woes will affect the competitive landscape. The outbreak has spread across nine states and sickened more than 50 customers. The chain also came under question when 150 people who ate at a Boston Chipotle contracted norovirus.
"
166,CMG,"Chipotle's woes could open up opportunities for other fast-casual chains to pick up market share.
"
167,CMG,"""For every loser, there will be a winner, and Panera will be the real winner at the start,"" said Maxim's Anderson. ""Even though Panera is not a direct competitor to Chipotle in terms of Mexican food, they have a lot of geographic overlap and share the same types of customer.""
"
168,CMG,"Anderson recently made Zoe's a top pick for 2016, saying that its compelling menu, demographic targets and solid economics all support continued expansion.
"
169,CMG,"Tristano is among those who reckon that Chipotle can bounce back and re-establish itself as a force in the restaurant industry.
"
170,CMG,"""Fortunately for Chipotle and other brands, consumers tend to be very forgiving,"" he said. ""The Chipotle brand has a very strong customer following, and because of that they are still in a great posi tion. Of course, they still have to ensure quality and safety, which they are very focused on right now.""
"
171,CMG,"Even though fast-casual chains have stumbled of late, many industry watchers still have a positive outlook on the sector.
"
172,CMG,"Sit-Down Still No Standout
"
173,CMG,"Tristano forecasts 7.1% unit growth for fast-casual chains in 2016, in contrast to around 1% for full-service eateries.
"
174,CMG,"""There's still a market-share shift away from more traditional full-service/fast-food categories and toward fast-casual,"" Tristano said.
"
175,CMG,"That's mainly because consumers continue to gravitate toward what fast-casual chains offer, according to analyst Charles.
"
176,CMG,"""The appeal to consumers is higher-quality food in a faster time frame,"" Charles said. ""That's not going out of style.""It's understandable if executives at Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and other fast-casual restaurant chains are feeling a little heartburn heading into the new year.The recent E. coli outbreak at dozens of Chipotle restaurants was enough to give the whole restaurant sector indigestion, considering that Chipotle had been one of the industry's leading lights earlier in the year. Even before the E. coli news hit, though, Chipotle and other fast-casual chains were falling out of favor on Wall Street.""It's been a tough market for high-beta restaurant stocks,"" Cowen & Co. analyst Andrew Charles told IBD. ""There's a very risk-averse type of investor out there, which you can see in the fact that two of the best restaurant performers have been big names like McDonald's (MCD) and Starbucks (SBUX) . In comparison, high-beta stocks have underperformed.""Shares of Chipotle, Panera Bread (PNRA), Shake Shack (SHAK), Zoe's Kitchen (ZOES), Fiesta Restaurant Group (FRGI), Habit Restaurants (HABT) and El Pollo Loco (LOCO) spent the latter half of 2015 heading south.Analysts say that a number of factors contributed to the decline, including slowing financial growth, overheated valuations and competition from an increasingly crowded field.Fast Casual Off IPO Menu?The challenge facing fast-casual restaurant stocks as they enter 2016 is figuring out how to recapture some of the magic that pushed the group to record highs during the first half of 2015. That won't be easy, considering the current mindset of many investors.It's also unlikely that you'll see many new issues stepping in to give the fast-casual group a shot of adrenaline in 2016, says Maxim Group analyst Stephen Anderson.""You're seeing harder market conditions for a lot of IPOs — not just for restaurants, but also for tech firms and other industries,"" Anderson told IBD.Meanwhile, slowing same-restaurant sales growth has hit most fast-casual chains of late. Zoe's, Fiesta, El Pollo Loco and Habit logged decelerating comp growth during the first three quarters of the year. While Panera saw a year-over-year improvement in comp growth during each of its first three quarters of 2015, that came off easy comparisons with 2014, when gains were minimal.Chipotle Stock Turns ToxicThe real trouble came for Chipotle, whose comparable restaurant sales growth decelerated in each of the first three quarters of 2015, all down sharply from 2014. During the second quarter, Chipotle's comp growth fell to 4.3% from 17.3% the prior year. Q3 comps grew 2.6% vs. 19.8% a year earlier.Things got even worse earlier this month when Chipotle, in the throes of its E. coli crisis, warned that fourth-quarter same-store sales won't increase but instead will fall by 8% to 11%. The company also said that earnings per share will end up at $2.45 to $2.85 a share, well off the $4.09 that analysts had expected.Amid new E. coli issues, Chipotle's stock fell 8.5% in the last week, 35% off its August peak.The best performer among fast-casual stocks has been Shake Shack, which had its initial public offering in January. Its year-over-year comps grew 11.7% during the first quarter, 12.9% during the second, and 17.1% during the third. Even so, Shake Shack shares are down 58% from their high of 96.75, set in May.All of the fast-casual players have faced rising competition — not just from each other, but also from privately held chains and small local and regional operations looking to hop on the fast-casual bandwagon.""It's a very fragmented industry,"" Cowen's Charles said.

Jarden rose 9% last week on merger speculation, moving the stock up the right side of a five-month consolidation.China-based maker of solar electrical components Trina Solar (TSL) spiked 9% on news reports that the company had received an offer to be taken private at $11.60 per share by Shanghai Xingsheng Equity Investment & Management. The offer was 321% above Friday's closing price.Edwards Lifesciences (EW) was confusing brokerage data collection systems in premarket trade, as it prepared to go live with its 2-for-1 stock split at today's open. It is the company's first stock split since May 2010.Overseas, Europe's stocks came off their lows near midday. London's FTSE 100 reversed early losses and wrestled into narrowly positive territory.

372,CMG,"Restaurant stocks have taken a stomach-turning tumble in the last few months, with once high-flying companies like Chipotle Mexican Grill and Buffalo Wild Wings sinking about 20% since early August. IBD's Retail-Restaurants group, which ranked No. 5 at the start of 2015, now ranks 111 out of the 197 industries IBD tracks and has fallen 18% since hitting a collective…
"
373,CMG,"McDonald's (MCD) held its annual investor/analyst day Tuesday on the same day that thousands of fast-food workers nationwide held protests calling for higher pay, but the company chose to focus on its growth strategies.The meeting took place as McDonald's eyes ways to better compete against fast-food rivals such as Yum Brands (YUM) — owner of the KFC and Taco Bell chains — as well as fast-casual chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Panera Bread (PNRA) and Shake Shack (SHAK).During the first hour of the scheduled four-hour meeting, McDonald's Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook and other officials outlined several new goals that the company looks to achieve in coming months.""My priorities for McDonald's as a modern, progressive burger company are threefold: driving operational growth, creating brand excitement and enhancing financial value,"" Easterbrook said. ""We are taking bold, urgent action to reset the business and prepare the company for the next chapter of its history.""McDonald's constant-currency financial targets for 2016 include systemwide sales growth of 3% to 5% and operating income growth of 5% to 7%, excluding potential charges associated with its refranchising strategy and cost-saving initiatives.More Franchises, Fewer CostsIn terms of refranchising, the company raised its target to 4,000 restaurants from an earlier target of 3,500. This accelerates the pace and increases the global franchised percentage from the current 81% to about 93% by the end of 2018. McDonald's long-term goal is to become 95% franchised.McDonald's also raised its net annual general and administration cost-savings target to $500 million, most of which will be realized by the end of 2017. This reflects a $200 million increase from the previously announced target. The new target excludes the impact of foreign currency changes.In addition, Easterbrook said McDonald's has no plans to spin off its properties into real estate investment trusts, as had been speculated.""We have given REITs serious consideration, but we don't believe it serves best the interests of shareholders to pursue REITS at this time,"" he said.Easterbrook also mentioned plans to grow its store count internationally and improve McDonald's level of efficiency and customer service. It looks to add more restaurants along Germany's Autobahn, for example. Meanwhile, it is looking to change the way it toasts buns and grills meat.""We were not executing to our standards,"" he said. ""We were missing customer expectations in too many places. For too long we've asked customers to adapt to us. A big part of turning that around is giving customers more choice and always adapting to meet their needs.""Meanwhile, McDonald's board declared a quarterly cash dividend of 89 cents per share of common stock, payable on Dec. 15 to shareholders of record at the close of business on Dec. 1. This represents a 5% increase over its previous quarterly dividend.Protests NationwideWhile the meeting was taking place, fast-food workers in hundreds of U.S. cities held strikes and demonstrations calling for higher wages. It was the largest collection of rallies yet in a cause that seeks to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.The demonstrations began around dawn at McDonald's locations in New York, Boston, Philadelphia and other cities. The protests are expected to continue throughout the U.S. for the remainder of the day and culminate in a rally at the Republican presidential debate in Milwaukee.Earlier this year McDonald's said it would raise wages by more than 10% for workers at U.S. restaurants that it operates, and pay at least $1 more per hour than the local minimum wage for workers at U.S. restaurants.Financially, though, the company has been in a bit of a funk of late. It has logged five straight quarters of lower sales. Year-over-year earnings have declined in four of the last five quarters, though its most recent quarter showed a 28% EPS gain. That kind of performance compares unfavorably to other stocks in IBD's Retail-Restaurants group, including Starbucks (SBUX), Chipotle and Shake Shack.Even so, McDonald's stock price has been on a nice roll lately. Shares hit a fresh high of 113.96 on Oct. 26 and are up more than 10% since Oct. 21.Growth DriversIn a Monday morning note, RBC analyst David Palmer said McDonald's stock price has mainly been driven by gains in return on invested capital as well as recent earnings growth and earnings-per-share revisions.EPS growth has been driven in part by same-store sales gains in international markets, he said.On the downside, U.S. comps ""(have) dramatically slowed,"" Palmer noted. ""The company's struggles inside the U.S. have been the most troubling since declining same-store sales have been the result of significant share losses in an otherwise healthy U.S. fast food market in 2015.""On a more positive note, McDonald's recent decision to offer an all-day breakfast menu has been a success.""We believe that McDonald's consumer base is broader at breakfast, so increased availability of breakfast items could inspire trial of other core items and day parts,"" Palmer said.McDonald's shares rose 0.3% on the stock market today.

423,CMG,"Whether the stock market is enjoying a big market uptrend or bobbing up and down like a buoy in the ocean, earnings growth still matters. The numerous positive surprises in earnings-per-share gains that large-cap companies have issued across the market in the past couple of weeks have certainly helped investors feel more bullish.Earnings research firm S&P Capital IQ sees third-quarter earnings dropping 3.8% among S&P 500 firms to $28.92 a share. That's a solid improvement from the 5% decline seen on Oct. 6. Plus, earnings would likely be up 4.5% for the S&P 500 minus the energy drag.A 4.5% overall gain might not be something to hoot and holler about. The mild increase reflects an economy that is still recovering at a modest pace. Revenue increases have been equally weak. In that light, today's IBD Big Cap 20 screen can be useful in guiding readers to the small minority of companies that are growing much faster.Do not forget that 25% EPS growth is the minimum threshold for IBD's CAN SLIM stock selection system. Consistent double-digit profit increases that fall short of that high bar are still acceptable for large, established companies.Growth deceleration, as seen in former Big Cap 20 component Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) (EPS up 52%, 47%, 27% and 11% in the past four quarters) can knock the stock's EPS Rating down and spark sell-offs.Today, Chipotle is still a great business with outstanding products, service and management. Yet for now, the hot sauce is missing from its quarterly numbers. Thus, the stock is no longer on the screen.Southwest Airlines (LUV) is coming off a thrilling ride, thrusting ahead 11.5% last week for its fourth straight up week.Some traders might say that the reason lies in the stock's ""cheap"" valuation, currently 14 times trailing 12-month earnings per share. But a bigger reason may be the company's outstanding job in delivering above-normal profit growth. Last week, the discount air carrier reported a 71% jump in Q3 earnings to 94 cents a share, slightly above the consensus view. That's on top of a 62% EPS increase in the year-earlier quarter.No matter what the industry, that is called ""crushing it."" Over the past six quarters, Southwest's EPS growth has averaged 102%.Alphabet (GOOGL) is rising fast after notching an 18% jump in Q3 profit, marking a third quarter of growth acceleration (3%, 5%, 17%, 18%).Cognizant Technology (CTSH) has rallied 51% since last October. On Monday, the stock was just above a 68.06 cup-with-handle entry point. Wall Street sees EPS up 15% to 76 cents a share in Q3. Over the past four quarters, the average gain was 15.3%. Earnings are due Nov. 4.Starbucks (SBUX) issues Q4 results late Thursday. Expect a 16% rise to 43 cents a share. Earnings have nearly quadrupled from fiscal 2008 (36 cents) to 2014 ($1.33).

482,CMG,"Earnings season for top-performing stocks begins to ramp up this week, with reports due from IBD 50 companies like Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and A.O. Smith (AOS).Hawaiian HoldingsAirline company Hawaiian Holdings (HA) carries passengers to Hawaii, Pago Pago, Samoa and Tahiti, among other places. It will announce earnings late Monday and is expected to record a 56% jump in EPS to $1.23 on a 1.8% drop in revenue to $628.3 million.Continued low fuel costs are helping boost the bottom line for Hawaiian and the rest of the airline industry. But even nonfuel costs are improving for Hawaiian. Earlier this month, the carrier revised its Q3 growth estimate for cost per available seat mile and now sees it rising 1.5%-2.5% vs. its prior outlook for a 2.5%-5.5% increase.Hawaiian's stock formed a cup-with-handle base after six months of consolidation and rose above a 25.69 buy point on Oct. 8, closing at 26.21. Since then, it's climbed about 13%.Chipotle Mexican GrillThe fast-casual chain is on tap to release earnings late Tuesday. Analysts are looking for 12% EPS growth to $4.63 on a 12% boost in sales to $1.22 billion. Both represent the fourth straight quarter of deceleration.But Chipotle Mexican Grill recently returned carnitas, a popular burrito and taco filling made of pork, to its menu in most of its stores, raising expectations for a re-acceleration in sales growth.Longer term, Chipotle's hiring of former Starbucks (SBUX) Chief Information Officer Curt Garner as its first CIO is seen as a sign that the burrito chain is getting serious about boosting digital engagement with its customers to lift sales further.Manhattan AssociatesAtlanta-based Manhattan Associates (MANH) reports Tuesday after the market close. Consensus is for a 13% increase in earnings per share to 36 cents on a 12% rise in revenue to $141.1 million.One specialty for the supply-chain management software developer is warehouse management. On Tuesday, ARC Advisory Group's warehouse market analysis ranked Manhattan as the leading global supplier of such applications and services.Manhattan Associates has a best-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating, and its stock is outperforming the market. It's working on the right side of a first-stage cup base with a 69.91 buy point.A.O. SmithIBD's New America section recently featured this 141-year-old maker of water heaters.A.O. Smith, which reports early Wednesday, operates under its namesake brand as well as American Water Heaters, GSW, Lochinvar and other brands. It's the top water heater and boiler maker in the U.S. and China. Analysts forecast a 34% hike in EPS to 79 cents on a 12% advance in revenue to $649.9 million.BB&T; Capital Markets analyst Kevin Maczka recently told IBD that the company ""is doing a terrific job,"" adding, ""They have strong growth drivers,"" including a strong market position and new, more energy-efficient water heaters.AlphabetAlphabet reports Thursday after the market close. Consensus is for a 13% hike in EPS to $7.20 on a 12% increase in revenue to $18.53 billion.With the recent reorganization of the Internet giant, investors are eager to see for the first time how Alphabet breaks out its core search-business financials from its other ""moonshot"" businesses.They include a life sciences business that is developing glucose-sensing contact lenses so diabetics don't have to make painful pinpricks to obtain blood samples. Alphabet is also developing self-driving cars and finding ways to extend human longevity.But while some analysts and investors have been hoping that the additional transparency might pressure Alphabet to rein in spending, Bank of America Merrill Lynch recently said that the new structure could actually result in an acceleration of spending, as the noncore units become freer to expand.Follow James DeTar on Twitter @IBD_JDeTar and Facebook.

MGM Resorts International (MGM) has been under pressure from shareholder Land and Buildings Investment to sell real estate.Sears (SHLD) spun off its property into Seritage Growth Properties (SRG).

They give investors exposure to the financial services and real estate sectors.Select Sector SPDR ETFs track modified market-cap-weighted indexes of select S&P 500 companies.The new Financial Services Select Sector SPDR (XLFS) holds businesses in these industries: diversified financial services, insurance, banks, capital markets, consumer finance, thrifts and mortgage real estate investment trusts (REITs).The new Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) includes real estate management, development and REITs, with the exception of mortgage REITs.The two products reflect changes to the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) structure announced by S&P Dow Jones Indices.Basically, XLFS and XLRE break the bellwether Financial Sector SPDR (XLF) into two pieces. The 88 companies currently in XLF are now also assigned to the two new sector SPDR ETFs — 63 in XLFS and 25 in XLRE.""As investors continue to expand their uses of sector ETFs, they are interested in gaining more granular exposure to financial companies,"" James Ross, global head of SPDR ETFs at State Street Global Advisors, said in a press statement.XLF remains unchanged for those seeking broad-based exposure to financials, he added.Simultaneously, the expense ratios for the entire Sector SPDR ETF suite dropped from 0.15% to 0.14%.That's a savings of $1 for every $10,000 you invest, in case you're wondering. That's not quite enough for a burrito from Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), a top 25 holding in Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY). But it's good enough for the tip.XLY is the top-performing sector-focused exchange traded fund in 2015 as well as a winner over 5-, 10- and 15-year periods. It holds highly rated stocks such as Nike (NKE). Nike and Skechers (SKX) are benefiting from the 'athleisure' trend — in other words, the brunch crowd pairing their Lululemon (LULU) yoga pants with Chloe clutches.The ETF rose 1.2% on the stock market today.The Select Sector SPDR ETF suite holds $88.07 billion in assets. When the ETFs launched in 1998, their expense ratio was 0.65%.As institutional and increasingly individual investors incorporate sector SPDR ETFs into their ETF strategies, economies of scale have allowed their sponsors to lower overall costs.Follow Aparna Narayanan on Twitter @IBD_ANarayanan.

538,CMG,"What a difference a week makes. Not long ago, scores of stocks saw their breakouts fizzle, if not trigger sell signals, amid the recent market downturn. Now, with the market back in a confirmed uptrend, many leaders have recovered and broken out to new highs or are setting up for potential breakouts.In fact, a few IBD 50 stocks such as Epam Systems (EPAM), Global Payments (GPN) and Universal Insurance (UVE) are already well out of reach from their buy points.Some other leaders are still within the 5% buy zone from their recent breakouts.Bank of the Ozarks (OZRK) cleared a 45.25 cup-with-handle buy point Tuesday. Note that volume was only 15% above average, short of the 40% minimum threshold that's ideal at a breakout. The base was also late stage, which carries higher risk than early-stage patterns. Ozarks reports Q3 earnings Tuesday after the close.On Thursday, Starbucks (SBUX) recrossed a 59.06 buy point that it initially climbed past Monday. It remains 1% above the entry. Turnover was below average both days. An up-down volume ratio above the neutral 1.0 level, however, indicates demand for shares.Total System Services (TSS) on Friday cleared an early 48.18 buy point of a cup with handle in average trade. The conventional entry is just ahead at 48.77. The stock has advanced in eight of the past nine sessions. Its relative strength line is in new high ground, a bullish sign.The Georgia-based company leads the credit card and payment processing group with a 99 Composite Rating. The group also includes Global Payments and Blackhawk Network (HAWK).Blackhawk rose past a 46.23 entry intraday Friday before closing slightly below the entry. Excluding the Aug. 24 flash crash, the correction in the base was 18%, normal for a proper pattern. The provider of gift cards and payment service reports Q3 results Tuesday after the close.Other IBD 50 stocks nearing their buy points and setting up potential breakouts across a broad range of sectors include Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), which is 3% below a 758.71 flat-base buy point.O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) is close to a 258.25 entry, also from a flat base, and Paycom Software (PAYC) is slightly below a 41.68 buy point.All the stocks in this column were in the Oct. 5 issue.

551,CMG,"Sector rotation is pretty much a done deal, if the Big Cap 20 is any guide. Last spring and summer, the medical sector was providing a third to a half of the names in the Big Cap 20.The summer leaders' charts now look sad. Biogen (BIIB) is 40% off its high. Illumina (ILMN) is 33% off its high. (It plunged after hours on preannounced Q3 revenue and full-year guidance that missed views.) Regeneron (REGN) is 23% off its high.In Tuesday's Big Cap 20, only one medical stock made the list.Heart-valve maker Edwards Lifesciences (EW) is on the list, despite a couple of breakouts that offered meager gains. A breakout on March 16 yielded a 9% gain in five sessions, then the stock consolidated. A breakout in July yielded an 8% gain in about three weeks before the stock consolidated.Small gains do not give individual investors much of a chance to make money.Edwards is now forming a new consolidation, but is it good news? In Monday's IBD, the medical sector was No. 19 of 33 sectors after being in the top four most of the year through September.If the medical sector is finished as a leader, what has replaced the medical stocks? An investor might just as well ask what hasn't replaced the medical stocks.The Big Cap 20's leadership is now more diverse than it has been all year.Its stocks are from many sectors, including retail, software, tobacco and leisure.Many are in early-stage patterns, thanks to resets or breakouts that didn't advance 20% or more.A reset occurs when a stock's low undercuts the low of its previous base, which resets the count at one. A first- or second-stage base has a better shot at success than a later-stage base.The following Big Cap 20 stocks feature first-stage bases:Software sector play Salesforce.com (CRM) is working on a first-stage consolidation. The stock has regained its 200-day and 50-day lines, and is only 4% off a new high.Breakouts this year led to gains of 9% and 10%. The stock hasn't posted a gain of 20% from a breakout since August-November 2013.Retail sector stock Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is working on a first-stage pattern. The stock is 4% off its high and is battling to retake its 50-day line.Breakouts this year led to gains of 15%, 4% and most recently 4%.Tobacco sector stock Reynolds American (RAI) cleared a 44.24 buy point Monday, but strong volume was missing. A valid breakout usually delivers a volume spike of at least 40% above average. Strong volume is the mark of institutional activity.Food and meat stock Hormel (HRL) rushed past a 64.23 buy point Monday. Volume was 130% above average. The stock is defensive and seldom delivers big gains out of breakouts. Hormel's last big gain was a 44% pop out of a November 2012 breakout.

632,CMG,"America is known as the land of second chances. The country's stock market is known for giving them too. If you miss a breakout in heavy volume, don't worry about it. Stocks often pull back to or near their proper buy points, giving another sound opportunity to buy.

"
635,CMG,"A pullback in light volume is preferable to a pullback in heavy volume. The former indicates the stock's foundation of institutional investor support is still strong. Few holders are willing to dump their positions. The latter can be indicative of an unhealthy market — one where institutional selling is causing strong headwinds.
"
636,CMG,"Other times, a stock will pull back and fall below a buy point. It doesn't mean the breakout is doomed, particularly when the 8%-loss sell rule is not triggered.

"
639,CMG,"The ones that are easier to hold often occur in the early stages of a new market uptrend. After a meaningful bear market in the major averages that wiped the slate clean of sellers, institutional investors are eager to put money to work. The buying provides a good foundation in stocks. In this case, stocks generally won't have a hard time holding above buy points. Some will come back to buy points, but plenty of others will show strength, refusing to give up much ground.
"
640,CMG,"But breakouts that occur in the later stages of bull markets tend not to work as well because institutional buying isn't as pronounced. In such a case, it's more common to see stocks pull back to buy points.

Revenue rose 37% to $1.74 bil, roughly in line with analysts' expectations.Avago, jointly headquartered in Singapore and San Jose, Calif., is a supplier for Apple, which has scheduled an event next week to unveil its iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus models.Although there has been some worry on Wall Street about possibly waning demand for the new Apple iPhone models, Avago CEO Hock Tan guided investors to double-digit sequential growth for the company's wireless business.Wireless demand continues to be robust but is ""curtailed by a lack of capacity,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani in a report.He rates Avago's stock as overweight and kept his price target at 150.Meanwhile, Pacific Crest Securities analyst John Vinh said increased capacity of FBAR (filters used in cellphones to allow only specific frequencies to be transmitted) is a positive for Avago's participation in the upcoming Apple smartphones.Avago shares are up 18.7% so far this year, though they fell 5.2% Tuesday to 119.37, just below their 200-day moving average.

758,CMG,"The market is in a correction, so it's understandable that many IBD 50 names are trading below their 50-day moving averages. But some are showing strength.As investors search for stocks to buy once the inevitable uptrend comes, they should look for strength. One area for prospecting is the airline industry group, ranked No. 32 as of Friday's IBD.Some carriers are weathering labor troubles and a federal investigation into alleged price fixing. But two regional airlines, Hawaiian (HA) and Alaska Air (ALK), make this week's IBD 50.Alaska fell as much as 23% in the Aug. 24 Monday morning meltdown, but recovered to close just 4% below the previous day's close and above its 50-day line. Except for the one-day break, the stock has moved up normally since it broke out of a late-stage flat base in July.On Sept. 2, Alaska reported a 7% increase in August traffic, a 7.7% increase in capacity, while the load factor fell 0.5 point to 86.7%.Hawaiian appears to be building a ragged consolidation with a 26.20 buy point.Both companies are scheduled to make a presentation at Cowen & Co.'s eighth annual global transportation conference on Sept. 9.Lannett (LCI) had a strong week, popping 13% Thursday. It announced it has agreed to buy Kremers Urban Pharmaceuticals for $1.23 billion. The one-day move put the stock near the intersection of its 50-day and 200-day lines. The stock remains well off its high.Investors have laced up their sneakers and held Foot Locker (FL) and Nike (NKE) at reasonable levels during the correction.Nike is just below its 50-day moving average and 6% from a high.Foot Locker is tracking just along the north side of the support line.August retail sales figures showed that companies in the athleisure space were doing well.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) broke out of a double-bottom base July 22 and has mostly held above a 699.13 buy point since then, finding support at its 50-day line. The stock has made a nice move since a 2008 low, but the double-bottom must be considered first-stage since it undercut a prior base.Icon (ICLR), which does clinical research for drug and biotech firms, is holding at its 50-day line after briefly dipping below it Aug. 24.It broke out of a flat base July 28. It has pulled back nearly to the 72.50 buy point.For the week, the IBD 50 fell 3.7% vs. 3.4% for the S&P 500.

759,CMG,"Whew. What a week. After falling as much as 9%, the Nasdaq notched a weekly gain of 2.6%.

"
760,CMG,"One of the most tempting things to do is buy a stock that's in a good technical setup ahead of earnings. Top fundamentals? Check. Sound chart? Check. Signs of institutional buying in recent days and weeks? Check.
"
761,CMG,"What's not to like? The market seems to expect a solid report, so why not buy?
"
762,CMG,"If you've tried this strategy, it may have worked some of the time, but plenty of other times, it didn't.
"
763,CMG,"The bottom line is that it's practically impossible to tell how a stock will react around earnings.
"
764,CMG,"Even stocks with bullish-looking charts fall apart on seemingly solid numbers.
"
765,CMG,"Of course, having a big profit cushion makes it easier to hold through earnings. A stock might gap down 5% to 10% on weak results, but with a 30% or 50% profit cushion, that's not too big a hit. But it's a different story when the profit cushion is small.
"
766,CMG,"One way of dealing with volatility around earnings reports is by using inexpensively priced weekly call options.
"
767,CMG,"The options strategy is a way to capitalize on the upside potential of a stock's move around earnings. Even better, the strategy reduces the risk of a negative reaction to earnings by limiting how much you can lose. The cost is reasonable, much less than what you would typically risk when buying actual shares of a stock.
"
768,CMG,"One call option gives you the right, but not the obligation, to buy 100 shares of a stock at a specific price (the strike) within a specific time period. You pay an option premium for this right. Five stock option contracts represents 500 shares.
"
769,CMG,"Here's how it works:
"
770,CMG,"Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) closed at 589.93 one day ahead of its Q2 earnings report on July 21 last year. A 590 call option had a premium of $20.58. The cost would have been $2,058 (100 x $20.58) to control 100 shares as opposed to shelling out $58,993 to buy the stock outright.
"
771,CMG,"To calculate the maximum risk for the trade, take the option premium ($20.58) and divide by the stock price (589.93). That gave you a trade with 3.5% downside risk.
"
772,CMG,"Chipotle gapped up the next day and opened at 650 (1). You could have exercised the option and paid $59,000 for 100 shares rather than $65,000. That's a profit of $6,000, but you have to subtract the amount paid for the premium ($2,058). The net profit is $3,942.
"
773,CMG,"If Chipotle had gapped down badly on weak results, the most you would've lost was the option premium you paid ($2,058). Losing 100% of an option premium is small in comparison to how much money you could lose if you owned the stock itself.
"
774,CMG,"In IBD Leaderboard, leading stocks with attractive call options are noted in the week ahead of their quarterly results.

775,CMG,"To review:

"
777,CMG,"Target weekly options with a strike price just out of the money and close to the proper buy point of the stock itself.
"

The stock is trading just 7% below its high reached last week.On Monday, Morgan Stanley raised its price target on Foot Locker, saying that the shoe retailer is ""best positioned to benefit from the likely long-lasting health and wellness/athleisure trend.""Chipotle might be on track for its seventh session of losses, but it has yet to breach its 50-day line, which recently crossed above the 200-day. That's a bullish sign that signals its recent performance has improved. Shares are about 8% below their high.Wedbush raised its price target on the fast-casual Mexican food chain on Monday as its store checks indicated same-store sales growth reacceleration in August.And Constellation Brands is starting to recover from Monday's plunge, with shares trading 6% below their recent high.

846,CMG,"Premium burger chain Shake Shack (SHAK) has developed an in-demand brand and coveted cool status with urban foodies. But the stock's rollercoaster path and premium price don't always inspire confidence on Wall Street.The New York-based restaurant chain is expected to bring in 3 cents in Q2 per-share earnings on revenue of $42.8 million when it reports after the close Monday. Despite positivity about Shake Shack's potential, several analysts continue to stay neutral on the stock.""While we continue to believe in Shake Shack's potential to ultimately generate at least $1.5 billion in revenue and north of $350 million in EBITDA, we remain on the sidelines given its rich valuation of 84 times our 2016 EBITDA estimate, particularly as we expect some inherent volatility in Shake Shack's quarterly results given its small restaurant base and real-time exposure to commodities,"" wrote William Blair analyst Sharon Zackfia in a July 20 note.Zackfia, who has a market perform rating on Shake Shack, added that management could potentially boost full-year revenue and same-store sales guidance following the company's ""strong results"" in the first half of 2015.Shake Shack has fewer than 70 locations worldwide — a low figure when compared with, say, Jack in the Box's (JACK) 2,200 or so restaurants or even Habit Restaurants' (HABT) 115-plus locations — but it has created a well-known name for itself.Developed by restaurateur Danny Meyer (of Gramercy Tavern and Eleven Madison Park fame), Shake Shack offers all-natural, vegetarian-fed Angus beef burgers and homemade frozen custard. Its high-end origins and socially conscious menu seem to resonate with foodies who don't mind paying a premium for what is usually a fast-food staple: burgers.Investors have thus far appeared willing to pay a premium for its stock as well.Shake Shack went public in late January after being priced at 21 per share. Shares hit a high of 96.75 on May 22, then sank back down to 48.21 by July 16, later popping 18% in just one day as its post-IPO lockup expired in late July.Shake Shack ran up 10.8% to 71.64 on Friday. (By comparison, Habit Restaurants fell 18% last week to a post-IPO low after issuing weak sales guidance.)""While Shake Shack certainly deserves to trade at a sharp premium to its peers, we believe company's long-term growth upside is already reflected in the share price,"" noted Longbow Research analyst Alton Stump in July. He holds a neutral rating on the stock.How can Shake Shack prove its worth to investors? The premium burger chain would need to be more like a nascent Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), he said.""In our opinion, the shares are currently reflecting SHAK generating approximately $170M of EBITDA,"" he wrote on July 2. ""In order to reach this level of profitability, SHAK will likely need to reach the company's long-term of 450 domestic locations over the next 7-10 years and also generate store-level margins similar to Chipotle during the equivalent stage of CMG's growth cycle.""RELATED:These 2 Chains' Earnings May Add To Growth StoriesShake Shack Chicken Can't Shake Stock's Turkey View.

While Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) seems to be able to pass on big price hikes to its relatively affluent patrons, fast-food chains such as McDonald's (MCD), Wendy's, Burger King (QSR) and Yum Brands' (YUM) Taco Bell struggle to shift any cost increases to their diners.

The authors then calculate that raising the average wage to $15 an hour would increase total staff compensation to $253,352.

Burger King's comps grew 4.6% in Q1 and 6.7% in Q2.Competition At DawnYum Brands (YUM) unit Taco Bell's new breakfast menu last year has upped the ante. Dunkin' Donuts (DNKN) and Starbucks (SBUX) also have emphasized breakfast, providing more choices for consumers weaned on Egg McMuffins.With competition fierce and barriers to moving upscale, fast-food chains have little scope to offset big hikes in the minimum wage, to as high as $15 per hour within a few years in Los Angeles, Seattle and some other big cities.""There are some people out there who naively say that these wages can simply be passed along in terms of price increases,"" said Wendy's CEO Emil Brolick said during the company's Q2 conference call. ""I don't think that the average franchisee believes that.""Raising the average fast-food wage — not the minimum — would require fast-food chains to hike prices by 11% or cut menu portions by 36%, according to an IBD analysis of data from a recent Purdue University study.While Chipotle has successfully hiked prices on its affluent clientele in San Francisco, neither choice is appetizing for fast-food chains or their customers.Labor costs account for roughly one-third of McDonald's expenses. But it has pledged to raise its hourly wages to one dollar above the local minimum wage at its company-owned stores.Kiosks Are No PanaceaSelf-serve kiosks like those at some McDonald's in the U.S., France and Australia should curb ordering mistakes — and may boost average tickets as some customers order, say, extra cheese without the silent judgment of others in line, analysts say.Wendy's top executives said that kiosks will likely replace employees as wage costs swell.Still, tech has limits. Minimum wage hikes may tilt the scales, but kiosks and computers are costly to install and maintain.McDonald's gets 70% of its sales from drive-through, which doesn't easily lend itself to touchscreens, according to Jennifer Bartashus, an intelligence analyst at Bloomberg.""Automation has potential to reduce employees marginally,"" she said. ""Generally you don't see all the registers open anyway.""Despite challenges in the fast food industry, McDonald's alone still saw $6.5 billion in Q2 sales.""When we look at the size of the market,"" Tristano said, ""it's easy to predict it's not going away.""Yet changing consumer tastes could mean that fast food's glory days are a thing of the past.""You're seeing a genuine shift happening where a chunk of people are moving away from fast food,"" Bartashus said, ""and it may become a permanent migration.""

""(Q2 was) affected by tough sales comparisons and higher wing costs. However, we believe as we go deeper into the year and as the company completes the acquisition of 41 franchise restaurants, which we expect to be accretive to fiscal 2016 revenue and earnings, and given what we view as a relatively attractive valuation for Buffalo Wild Wings, we continue to rate the stock as buy.""Collier says that wing costs ""remain high,"" but she says that they're expected to decline year-over-year by Q4 of this year.Buffalo Wild Wings is a part of IBD's Retail-Restaurants industry group.

1045,CMG,"Investors have had an insatiable appetite for fast-casual restaurant stocks, evident by a surge in initial public offerings in the past year and big first-day gains.
"
1046,CMG,"Another serving is coming. Chicken-wing king Wingstop (WING) is set for an IPO that begins trading Friday.
"
1047,CMG,"The Dallas-based company raised the estimated price of its offering Tuesday, suggesting investors are hungry for shares.
"
1048,CMG,"Wingstop fits into the popular fast-casual restaurant segment, a type of restaurant that does not offer full-table service but provides a higher quality of food with fewer frozen or processed ingredients.
"
1049,CMG,"According to research firm Technomic, annual sales in the fast-casual segment in 2014 increased at more than three times the rate of the total restaurant industry.
"
1050,CMG,"Technomic says the fast-casual field boosted annual sales approximately 13% last year to $39 billion.
"
1051,CMG,"While that is a small share of the total restaurant industry's $466 billion in annual sales, it compares with a growth rate of 3.8% for the entire restaurant business.
"

"
1060,CMG,"Restaurant valuations are high, which has attracted investors to the IPO field, hoping they can catch a ride on a fast-growing company, says Larry Miller, founder and CEO of restaurant industry research firm MillerPulse.
"
1061,CMG,"Those valuations are high because overall industry performance has been on an upward trend since 2013, thanks to a steadily improving economy.

"
1063,CMG,"That's been broad-based, with the exception of McDonald's (MCD), he adds.
"
1064,CMG,"THE COMPANY
"
1065,CMG,"Founded in 1994, Wingstop says it pioneered the concept of wings as a center-of-the-plate feature. It claims to be the largest fast-casual chicken-wing focused restaurant chain, having sold approximately 4 billion wings in the past 20 years.
"
1066,CMG,"Wingstop has 745 restaurants in 37 states and six countries. Of those, 726, or 97%, are franchised, with just 19 company-owned stores. Its largest market presence is in Texas and California. It has 27 restaurants in Mexico. International locations also include Indonesia, the Philippines and Russia.
"
1067,CMG,"Wingstop offers three versions of chicken wings: boneless, bone-in and chicken strips, with 11 ""bold, distinctive and craveable flavors,"" including mango habanero, Cajun, Hawaiian, hickory-smoked BBQ and mild.
"
1068,CMG,"It also offers hand-cut, seasoned fries and sides made fresh daily.
"
1069,CMG,"Family packs are on the menu, the largest being a 100-piece package. Carry-out orders constitute approximately 75% of sales.
"
1070,CMG,"On top of all that is an online ordering service.
"
1071,CMG,"Restaurant industry magazine QSR listed Wingstop among its ""Best Franchise Deals"" of 2014.
"
1072,CMG,"Food & Wine magazine put Wingstop on its list of ""Best Chicken Wings"" in 2014.
"
1073,CMG,"""While other concepts include wings as add-on menu items or focus on wings in a bar or sports-centric setting, we are singularly focused on wings, fries and sides, which generate approximately 90% of our sales,"" the company said in its IPO prospectus filing.
"
1074,CMG,"The small menu that Wingstop offers sets it apart from Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD), a giant in the field with sales last year of $1.6 billion. Sales at the sports bar and grill have climbed by double-digit percentages for 19 straight quarters. In addition to chicken wings, Buffalo Wild Wings has burgers, sandwiches, salads and beer — and much larger restaurants.
"
1075,CMG,"""Wingstop should not be considered to be another Buffalo Wild Wings,"" said John Gordon, principal at Pacific Management Consulting Group.
"
1076,CMG,"Wingstop says its customers are anchored by the sought-after demographic of 18-34-year-olds, which Wingstop says is a loyal group that dines at fast-casual restaurants more frequently.
"
1077,CMG,"RISK/CHALLENGES
"
1078,CMG,"The fast-casual restaurant arena is highly competitive.
"
1079,CMG,"The all-star in the group is Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), which came public in January 2006. Chipotle annual sales have grown by double-digit percentages 14 years in a row, which partly explains the enthusiasm for stocks in the sector.

1080,CMG,"""There's a tremendous amount of interest among investors to find another Chipotle,"" said Gordon.
"
1081,CMG,"It won't be easy to replicate Chipotle's success, he notes.
"
1082,CMG,"The challenge all restaurants face is that the market is saturated. Gordon estimates 1 million restaurants are in America. The plate is overflowing.
"
1083,CMG,"""Restaurants have grown faster than the population has grown,"" said Gordon. ""There's a supply and demand imbalance.""
"
1084,CMG,"But chicken's popularity works in Wingstop's favor.
"
1085,CMG,"""Chicken consumption has been tearing the heck out of beef consumption,"" Gordon said, with chicken getting hot in 1999.
"
1086,CMG,"THE RESULTS
"
1087,CMG,"Wingstop's same-store sales growth, an important measure of company performance, has been positive for 11 quarters. Domestic same-stores sales rose 10.7% year over year in the first quarter and 12.5% in the fourth quarter.
"
1088,CMG,"Revenue of $19 million in the first quarter was up 14% from the year-ago period, with net income of $2.55 million.
"
1089,CMG,"Revenue of $67.5 million in 2014 was up 14%, with net income of $9 million. Royalty revenue and franchise fees accounted for 56% of revenue.
"
1090,CMG,"Wingstop estimates there is opportunity to grow to 2,500 restaurants across the U.S., with ""significant international growth opportunity,"" saying it has 310 international restaurant commitments.
"
1091,CMG,"PROCEEDS
"
1092,CMG,"Of the 5.8 million shares being offered, 3.65 million are from current stockholders. Wingstop will not receive any proceeds from that sale. Of the remaining 2.15 million shares, based on an assumed price of 17 per share, Wingstop expects to receive proceeds of $30.9 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other fees.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings of $1.37 a share for the quarter, which ended in April. That's up 11% from the prior year and would mark the fifth straight quarter of double-digit EPS growth, but would mark a slowdown from 24% in Q2. Revenue is seen climbing 6% to $680 million. That would snap a four-quarter string of gradually accelerating top-line growth.Cracker Barrel, which runs a chain of more than 630 family restaurants in 42 states, boasts a strong IBD Composite Rating of 90. The stock fell 0.9% to 141.08 on the stock market Friday, finding resistance at the 50-day moving average for a third straight session.

Wall Street had expected comps to rise 11.7%.""The stock is down because the expectation was that comps would be better than what they reported,"" Sterne Agee analyst Lynne Collier told IBD.Chipotle's comps fell below expectations due to harsh weather patterns in late February and March in many parts of the U.S. and the loss of carnitas, a dish made from pork, says Collier.Chipotle had pulled the carnitas off the shelves earlier in the year from many locations because it had an issue with some of its pork suppliers, which hadn't lived up to its animal treatment standards, says Collier.Chipotle sees same-store sales growing by low-to-mid-single digits in 2015, reaffirming its guidance made when it reported fourth-quarter results. That would be below the double-digit pace it's been tracking.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected a 29% earn ings rise to $4.50 a share in the current Q2 prior to the report.First-quarter restaurant-level operating margin was 27.5%, an increase of 160 basis points from a year earlier.""They actually exceeded our earnings estimates on higher-than-expected margins,"" said Collier.Food costs were 33.9% of revenue, down 60 basis points from a year earlier. General and administrative expense fell 160 basis points to 5.8% of revenue. That, along with higher menu prices, lifted profitability.""Its results were a little lower than expected on the top line and a little better than expected on the margin,"" Collier said.She added, ""Their comps are still very strong relative to the industry. The driver behind that has been their focus on quality ingredients, which is what the millennials truly care about right now. On a longer-term basis they continue to be one of my favorite names.""Chipotle shares fell 5% to 657 in after-hours trading, presumably because of the sales miss. The stock had closed up 0.8% at 692.52, the best finish since the burrito king's Q4 earnings report.Fast-Casual AlternativesChipotle is part of the fast-casual restaurant segment, which has been outpacing the rest of the industry. The segment is pricier than fast-food chains, but offer a better dining experience and a cheaper, faster alternative to sit-down chains.Earlier Tuesday casual dining chain operator Brinker International (EAT) posted fiscal third-quarter earnings that were in line with views. But sales fell below forecasts. Brinker operates eateries Chili's Grill & Bar and Maggiano's Little Italy. Shares slid 3.7% Tuesday.Yum Brands (YUM), operator of Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC, rose 4% late Tuesday on better-than-expected earnings.

1287,CMG,"Best Mutual Funds 2015: April Performance Report
"
1288,CMG,"The $5.9 billion American Century Heritage Fund has been in a groove.
"
1289,CMG,"Its return this year through April 30 was 6.42%. That topped 91% of its midcap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc.
"
1290,CMG,"That was a big step up from the fund's performance over the past 12 months. Its 16.89% gain in that period beat 79% of its peers.
"
1291,CMG,"And it's a giant step up from its performance over the past three years.
"
1292,CMG,"In that span, the stock mutual fund's 13.61% average annual gain outran just 35% of its peer group.
"
1293,CMG,"Managers David Hollond and Greg Walsh have not changed their approach. It's the stock market that's changed, the managers say.
"
1294,CMG,"The market is rotating back toward the high-quality, low-debt stocks that this fund likes and that have made it a top stock mutual fund over the past decade.
"
1295,CMG,"Lead manager Hollond, 45, and senior investment analyst Nalin Yogasundram, 39, discussed from their offices in Kansas City, Mo., what the Heritage management team has been doing to return to the front ranks of successful investors.
"
1296,CMG,"IBD: Why is the mutual fund's relative performance improving?
"
1297,CMG,"Hollond: The weak economy and low-interest-rate environment were difficult for us.
"
1298,CMG,"In that environment the past several year, there was a high correlation between stocks. Investors did not differentiate between stocks. Lower-quality, highly leveraged companies would not do well without access to cheap capital.
"
1299,CMG,"Though the Federal Reserve has not acted yet, now it feels like (the start of interest rate hikes) is not far away, although it's not clear exactly when that will begin.
"
1300,CMG,"So the prospect of higher rates is turning into a headwind for lower-quality, highly leveraged companies. It's a tailwind for the type of higher-quality companies we like.
"
1301,CMG,"IBD: So the outlook for normalization of interest rates has helped the fund, right?
"
1302,CMG,"Hollond: So long as things normalize, that should benefit this fund. It's already benefiting.
"
1303,CMG,"IBD: For people who may not know your basic approach, take a moment to describe it, please.
"
1304,CMG,"Hollond: We are growth managers. What we look for is early recognition of acceleration in a company's growth rate. We try to find companies at the inflection of their fundamental improvement. We try to find companies growing faster today than in the recent past, and which will continue to grow faster. The key is, we look for catalyst-driven acceleration. We look for a driver that explains why the growth rate has picked up, a driver we can analyze and be confident that is sustainable for the foreseeable future.
"
1305,CMG,"IBD: You invest bottom up, not based on sectors. Yet sector weights reflect where you've been expecting to find buys. Why were consumer discretionary, technology and industrials your three biggest sectors as of March 31?
"
1306,CMG,"Yogasundram: We look for bottom-up ideas. But consumer discretionary and tech have dispersion. You can find companies doing well vs. companies doing badly. It's unlike energy, where it's much harder to find dispersion.
"
1307,CMG,"IBD: Is your stake in Harman International Industries (HAR) a play on U.S. economic expansion fueling more car purchases?
"
1308,CMG,"Hollond: Harman does infotainment in car systems. Years ago, you found that only in high-end cars. It's been moving down market. So Harman has been improving its content per car.
"
1309,CMG,"Yes, they're benefiting from a cyclical trend. But Harman is also a secular story, independent of the economic cycle. There's this secular trend toward infotainment and people wanting all of their (digital) devices to connect with their car's entertainment system and GPS. People are willing to spend more money on that. Harman has gained share and dollar content per car, getting paid more per car.
"
1310,CMG,"IBD: What did you see in LinkedIn (LNKD) that made you boost the fund's stake to 326,000 shares as of Dec. 31 from 281,000 as of Oct. 31?
"
1311,CMG,"Yogasundram: LinkedIn is the professional network that has the most and very accurate data on professionals like us. They're layering in more services (that they can sell) to take advantage of that data. They started by helping recruiters find better candidates for jobs. Now they're laying in services to help corporate marketing divisions sell to other businesses.
"
1312,CMG,"And they're selling services to China. They're leveraging data well. And they're expanding services from human resources and recruiting to sales and marketing, and they're going international. It's a solid secular growth company.
"
1313,CMG,"IBD: Thoughts on last Friday's price plunge on a disappointing outlook?
"
1314,CMG,"Yogasundram: LinkedIn is a solid company with a good long-term outlook. However, a combination of an acquisition-related write-off and some sales reorganization drove a temporary headwind.
"
1315,CMG,"IBD: Chipmaker Avago Technologies' (AVGO) growth has picked up. Earnings per share went from an 8% decline eight quarters ago to quarterly gains of 3%, 16%, 29%, 39%, 70%, 124% and 149%. Is it sustainable for now?
"
1316,CMG,"Yogasundram: There are two reasons their EPS growth accelerated and will continue to improve. First, they have a top-notch management team that bought good companies in the past. Most recently, they bought LSI, which was a badly run, high-cost company with a bloated infrastructure. They made it more efficient. Those gains dropped straight to their bottom line, which you've been seeing in their EPS.
"
1317,CMG,"Avago is the leading provider of communications devices to the iPhone and Samsung smartphones. As phones get more complex, Avago is a share gainer. And they've increased their dollar content on phones. That will continue with the iPhone 6 and 6+ and new Samsung phones as well.
"
1318,CMG,"IBD: AmerisourceBergen (ABC) is another holding with accelerating EPS growth. Is this a beneficiary of ObamaCare?
"
1319,CMG,"Hollond: The Affordable Care Act means more people are covered by insurance, so more people get health care and drugs. The ACA is a driver, but not the full story.
"
1320,CMG,"AmerisourceBergen is a pure play on drug distribution. If that's what you want to invest in, you can get that solely through AmerisourceBergen.
"
1321,CMG,"They've got some favorable fundamentals driving long-term attractiveness. With generics, after this year there will be robust acceleration in the generics launch calendar. That will provide a lift.
"
1322,CMG,"IBD: What about specialty pharmaceuticals?
"
1323,CMG,"Yogasundram: That's another area for them. They have key expertise. And there's robust growth in the specialty area. And it's higher margin. So it's an increasingly larger part of their business.
"
1324,CMG,"Let me mention one last thing. They acquired MWI Veterinary Supply, which presents an increasing market they can go after.
"
1325,CMG,"IBD: Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is a play on heightened concerns about network security, right?
"
1326,CMG,"Yogasundram: You're right. What you have today is an installed base of security that is woefully behind the threats.
"
1327,CMG,"Palo Alto is a next-generation security company, enabling customers to better defend themselves. Palo Alto is a secular share gainer. And it provides many more services than its layered defenses.
"
1328,CMG,"Their initial sale to a customer is an appliance. The second, third and fourth sales are higher margin. Their services can tell a customer exactly what happened (when a security breach occurs) and how to prevent that breach.
"
1329,CMG,"IBD: Lighting sounds dull. What's attractive about Acuity Brands (AYI)?
"
1330,CMG,"Yogasundram: Acuity is the largest lighting equipment company in the U.S. Adoption of LED lights is accelerating, especially as costs go down, so customers are layering in more products with LEDs.
"
1331,CMG,"When you have both cyclical and secular drivers, we really like that. That's what we have here.
"
1332,CMG,"IBD: What's your outlook for Electronic Arts (EA), which plans to release its next ""Star Wars Battlefront"" game about a month before December's scheduled debut of the next ""Star Wars"" movie?
"
1333,CMG,"Yogasundram: We started investing a couple of years ago when a new management team came in. They found a heavily bloated infrastructure. In the past couple of years they've reduced costs, reduced the number of (game) titles. Margins expand from 9% and 10% to 25% in the four or five quarters.
"
1334,CMG,"IBD: Is your stake in Hain Celestial (HAIN) a play on the growing appeal of organic and healthful foods?
"
1335,CMG,"Yogasundram: Correct. They've been in organic foods for some time. But we're really seeing two things happen. One is that organics is not just a Whole Foods (WFM) story (which the fund also owned as of its latest disclosure). It is also a Kroger (KR) story. It is a Target (TGT) story. Organic food is going from early adopters to more mainstream consumption.
"
1336,CMG,"That's a trend we're playing in a few different directions, including Whitewave Foods (WWAV) and Constellation Brands (STZ).
"
1337,CMG,"With Hain, they're selling more to Whole Foods and to Target and Kroger, so they're expanding distribution. And they're layering in more products. So it's a solid organic secular growth story.
"
1338,CMG,"IBD: Constellation isn't an organic play, so what is your thesis?
"
1339,CMG,"Yogasundram: There is a consumption change. Millennials and people in general are drinking beer less and wine and spirits more.
"
1340,CMG,"Constellation was part owner of Corona, the largest U.S. beer brand, and they brought the brand in-house and a few others like Pacifico. Since then, they've boosted advertising and brand awareness, and really started to grow that business. Beer is a 1% to 2% grower, but they've been growing it 10% to 11% to 12% the past couple of years.
"
1341,CMG,"They've seen better margins and better capital allocations and buybacks, but the crux is that they're a share gainer.
"
1342,CMG,"Corona grows faster than the U.S. market. There's a growing U.S. population of Latin Americans, and their favorite (beer) is Corona. But the mainstream U.S. is also drinking more Corona.
"
1343,CMG,"Constellation is also bringing Pacifico and Modelo as alternate brands to the U.S.
"
1344,CMG,"IBD: Is Middleby (MIDD) a play on growing U.S. GDP growth?
"
1345,CMG,"Yogasundram: It is a play on the U.S. economy in general. But you're also getting refreshes (in commercial kitchen equipment). For example, Chipotle (CMG) wants not only Mexican food, but also to move into pizza. McDonald's (MCD) wants to change their mix of items to more health friendly. So changing consumer tastes drives changes in equipment.
"
1346,CMG,"And Middleby sees growth in emerging markets.

McDonald's (MCD) wants to change their mix of items to more health friendly. So changing consumer tastes drives changes in equipment.And Middleby sees growth in emerging markets. If Yum (YUM) wants to grow in China, it needs more restaurants, more ovens.

"
1348,CMG,"One key tool for stock chart analysis is the 10-week moving average line. As the individual investor studies a chart, he or she should ask these questions:
"
1349,CMG,"1. Are most of the weekly closes within the base above or below the 10-week line?
"
1350,CMG,"2. Are the closes high in the week's range or low in the range?
"
1351,CMG,"3. Are the weekly closes below and above the line coming in slow volume or fast volume?
"
1352,CMG,"Weekly closes in fast volume are especially relevant as the stock builds the right side of the base. Brisk selling on the left side of the pattern — when the stock is clearly in a downtrend — is understandable. However, the action on the right side should show solid evidence of buying.

Those early adopters include Brinker, owner of the Chili's and Maggiano's chains; and Red Robin, owner of its namesake chain of burger restaurants.""We expect rollout to additional casual dining companies over the next 12 to 24 months,"" Collier noted, though she didn't say which companies might be part of the rollout.Longer term, she reckons that other segments of the restaurant industry, including fine-dining establishments, will be users as well.""The model works as a revenue sharing arrangement as sponsorship and gaming revenues pay for the cost of the hardware,"" Collier said.She cites a few advantages of adopting Ziosk technology, including quicker service and higher checks due to an expected increase in the number of drinks and desserts ordered. She also says more kids might convince their parents to patronize Ziosk-enabled restaurants because of the tablet's gaming capabilities.Red Robin set a record stock high of 89.46 on March 24 and currently trades near 84. Brinker set a high of 63.40 on Feb. 19 and currently trades near 60.Both belong to IBD's Retail-Restaurants group, which ranks No. 6 out of 197 industries tracked.

1458,CMG,"The term ""fast casual"" conjures up a certain image in the restaurant industry — eateries that serve fresh food at affordable prices but without full table service.
"
1459,CMG,"Beyond that, there are vast differences.
"
1460,CMG,"At one end of the spectrum are ""burger in a bag"" restaurants, as Kevin Miles calls them. These places specialize in fresh-made burgers, hand-cut fries and soft drinks.
"
1461,CMG,"At the other end are restaurants that focus on wholesome fare that is free of additives and preservatives, and offer choices for customers on vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free diets.
"
1462,CMG,"That's the end occupied by Zoe's Kitchen (ZOES), where Miles serves as CEO.
"
1463,CMG,"Zoe's specializes in healthy, freshly prepared Mediterranean food such as chicken pita sandwiches, hummus, kabobs, salads and tabouli. Although it occupies a place in the fast-casual universe, several things set Zoe's apart from the usual crowd.
"
1464,CMG,"For one thing, much of its competition comes from outside the traditional fast-casual sector.
"
1465,CMG,"Although Miles sees Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and Panera Bread (PNRA) as his rivals, ""there are a few in the space that we don't see as direct competitors, such as burger or pizza restaurants. When our customers aren't eating at Zoe's, they are eating at Whole Foods (WFM) or at 'better-for-you' grocers.""
"
1466,CMG,"Another thing that sets Zoe's apart is the fact that it serves beer and wine. Most of the large fast casual chains don't. And unlike most chains, customers at Zoe's have food brought to their tables after they order at the cash register.
"
1467,CMG,"Upscale Appeal
"
1468,CMG,"Zoe's clientele also sets it apart. Women make up about 70% of customers, according to a recent note from analyst Stephen Anderson of Miller Tabak. Its core customer base is composed of college-educated women in the 25-to-54 age group who come from households with at least $100,000 in annual income.
"
1469,CMG,"""Women are our predominant consumer because most of the dining decisions are made by women,"" CEO Miles told IBD.
"
1470,CMG,"Because Zoe's gets most of its business from women, it tends to locate restaurants where the women are.
"
1471,CMG,"Analyst Anderson notes that the company ""seeks co-tenancy with retail chains catering to more affluent women with active lifestyles, such as Lululemon (LULU), Ulta (ULTA) and Ann Taylor (ANN) . Zoe's also seeks properties with high concentrations of offices nearby to sustain daytime traffic.""
"
1472,CMG,"Finally, the way Zoe's picks its markets is also different from the industry norm.
"
1473,CMG,"The company uses a ""hub and spoke"" strategy whereby it locates a major U.S. market — the hub — and then ""spokes out"" new locations from there. Most restaurant chains base their locations on local population density metrics.
"
1474,CMG,"Where Zoe's Goes
"
1475,CMG,"Miles points to the Dallas metro area as an example of its hub and spoke strategy. The company has 14 locations in the Dallas metro area and can probably expand to as many as 50 locations, he says.
"
1476,CMG,"""That's a huge concentration of locations, so from there we could spoke out to locations an hour or so from Dallas,"" Miles said. ""We could manage it from Dallas and be able to penetrate a lot of surrounding markets and bring a lot of efficiencies. We've done that in a lot of markets, including Atlanta, Charlotte (N.C.) and Jacksonville (Fla.).""
"
1477,CMG,"As of March 12, Zoe's had 140 restaurants in 15 states, including three franchises. Most are located in Southern states such as Texas, Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina and Virginia, though it will soon move into the Kansas City metro area, which will put it in both Kansas and Missouri.
"
1478,CMG,"The vast majority of its restaurants — about 90%, according to Anderson — are located in shopping centers rather than as stand-alone locations.
"
1479,CMG,"The company has delivered robust overall sales growth through the years thanks to an aggressive expansion plan. It opened 30 company-owned restaurants last year and acquired five franchise units.
"
1480,CMG,"Anderson looks for management ""to ease back to a high-teens to low-20% unit growth rate through the end of this decade, followed by 15% unit growth thereafter.""
"
1481,CMG,"Most of its near-term growth will take place in or near existing markets, Miles says.
"
1482,CMG,"Food And Finance
"
1483,CMG,"During its fourth quarter, Zoe's opened six company-owned restaurants and acquired three franchises. It logged overall Q4 sales of $40 million, up 40% from a year earlier and slightly above consensus views. Comparable-restaurant sales increased 7.8%.
"
1484,CMG,"The company posted a loss of 3 cents a share on an adjusted basis, better than the 5-cent shortfall that analysts had expected and vs. a 6-cent loss a year earlier.
"
1485,CMG,"For 2015, Zoe's expects revenue of $215 million to $220 million. The company guided 2015 comparable-restaurant sales growth to a range of between 4% and 6%, down from 2014's 6.7% gain.
"
1486,CMG,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year EPS of 6 cents in 2015 and 16 cents in 2016.
"
1487,CMG,"Like many restaurant chains, Zoe's got hit last year by rising costs of chicken and other food items, Miles says. He expects the company's cost of goods to decline ""ever so slightly"" this year as it gets bigger and as the company gains more buying power.
"
1488,CMG,"""A few years ago, we were too small to have much purchasing power, but that's not the case anymore,"" Miles said. ""We will continue to leverage our size with manufacturers and distributors"" to lower food costs.
"
1489,CMG,"Progress Since IPO
"
1490,CMG,"The restaurant chain had its initial public offering last April, priced at 15 a share. Zoe's stock rose as high as 38.42 on Oct. 31 and currently trades near 33.

Most are located in Southern states such as Texas, Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina and Virginia, though it will soon move into the Kansas City metro area, which will put it in both Kansas and Missouri.The vast majority of its restaurants — about 90%, according to Anderson — are located in shopping centers rather than as stand-alone locations.The company has delivered robust overall sales growth through the years thanks to an aggressive expansion plan. It opened 30 company-owned restaurants last year and acquired five franchise units.Anderson looks for management ""to ease back to a high-teens to low-20% unit growth rate through the end of this decade, followed by 15% unit growth thereafter.""Most of its near-term growth will take place in or near existing markets, Miles says.Food And FinanceDuring its fourth quarter, Zoe's opened six company-owned restaurants and acquired three franchises. It logged overall Q4 sales of $40 million, up 40% from a year earlier and slightly above consensus views. Comparable-restaurant sales increased 7.8%.The company posted a loss of 3 cents a share on an adjusted basis, better than the 5-cent shortfall that analysts had expected and vs. a 6-cent loss a year earlier.For 2015, Zoe's expects revenue of $215 million to $220 million. The company guided 2015 comparable-restaurant sales growth to a range of between 4% and 6%, down from 2014's 6.7% gain.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year EPS of 6 cents in 2015 and 16 cents in 2016.Like many restaurant chains, Zoe's got hit last year by rising costs of chicken and other food items, Miles says. He expects the company's cost of goods to decline ""ever so slightly"" this year as it gets bigger and as the company gains more buying power.""A few years ago, we were too small to have much purchasing power, but that's not the case anymore,"" Miles said. ""We will continue to leverage our size with manufacturers and distributors"" to lower food costs.Progress Since IPOThe restaurant chain had its initial public offering last April, priced at 15 a share. Zoe's stock rose as high as 38.42 on Oct. 31 and currently trades near 33.The company has an IBD Composite Rating of 82. It belongs to IBD's Retail-Restaurants group, which ranks No. 9 out of 197 industries tracked. Top-rated stocks in the group include Fiesta Restaurant Group (FRGI), Denny's (DENN) and Nathan's Famous (NATH).

1492,CMG,"Many investors are drawn to low-priced stocks like bears to honey. Truth is, it's an area of the market where institutional investors rarely fish. That means you shouldn't fish there, either.Prior to today, seven columns in this space have addressed the question: What makes a great base? Today's column is a reminder that when looking for good price setups, make sure stocks are priced at least $10 a share or higher.Retail shoppers love bargains. But in the stock market, what seems like a bargain usually isn't. Cheap stocks are usually cheap for a reason.Of course, it just sounds better buying 1,000 shares of a $1 stock as opposed to 10 shares of a $100 stock. The $1 stock goes up a dollar, yielding a tidy $1,000 profit. Meanwhile, the $100 stock goes up a dollar, yielding a $10 profit.Which sounds better? The logic may be flawed, but it's human nature to favor cheap stocks. Of course, there are stocks priced under 10 in IBD's database that have compelling fundamentals. Some have excellent Earnings Per Share, Relative Strength and Composite Ratings. ( Click on the IBD University tab at Investors.com to learn more about all of these ratings.)But it's not easy making money in low-priced stocks. It's a risky area of the market because most low-priced names lack a critical trait seen in past stock market winners: institutional sponsorship.Why do top mutual fund managers tend to shun low-priced stocks? Because they like liquidity, and cheap stocks rarely have it. Fund managers like to move into and out of a stock without being noticed. They can do that with liquid, highly priced names — not with illiquid ones.Fund managers like to focus on firms with an exceptional track record of earnings and sales growth. This is not easy to find in the low-priced space, where many firms talk the talk but can't walk the walk.It's not that money can't be made in low-priced stocks. It's just that the odds are much less in your favor.Truth is, some of the most profitable breakouts can come from higher-priced names. Not surprisingly, since they're more on the radar of institutional investors.""Expensive"" Often Is Not SoThe second half of 2012 yielded some powerful breakouts from institutional-quality names, as seen in the table above.MasterCard (MA) cleared a pre-split buy point of 448.10 in September 2012. For an individual investor, it may have been an easy stock to shun because of its price, but today it remains a true leader and shows strong institutional support.Mohawk Industries (MHK) broke out a few months later, clearing a buy point of 89.38. It has risen 109% since then.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) was trading around 150 a share in August 2010 with a lofty P-E of 30 times trailing earnings, but that didn't impede the stock. Over the next 10 months, the stock rallied 118% from a buy point of 154.53.It was no different in January 2013 as higher-priced institutional leaders like LinkedIn (LNKD), Sherwin-Williams (SHW) and Biogen Idec (BIIB) broke out of bases and went on lengthy uptrends.

Customers there were likely reacting to a December French fry shortage as well as a tooth and piece of plastic that were found in separate orders. But the dip remains an improvement from January's 12.6% comp decline.The region's negative results were partly offset by positive comps in Australia and the Lunar New Year, which occurred in February instead of January, McDonald's said.Same-restaurant sales in Europe edged up 0.7%.Quick service restaurants like McDonald's and Restaurant Brands' (QSR) Burger King face tough competition from rivals like Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), whose quick-but-healthy reputations have made them popular with customers.Steve Easterbrook replaced Don Thompson as McDonald's CEO on March 1.Follow Elaine Low on Twitter: @IBD_ELow.

It wasn't until Jan. 7 that Chipotle was able to retake the buy point in heavy volume; it's gone mostly sideways since then.Investors should make sure that Chipotle clears the 728.07 four-weeks-tight entry in volume that's at least 40% above normal before buying.Chipotle is among the top stocks in the highly rated Retail-Restaurants industry group, which includes Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) and Nathan's Famous (NATH).

1607,CMG,"Organic foods distributor Hain Celestial (HAIN) has helped stimulate the popularity of healthier foods, a trend analysts expect to continue when it reports second-quarter results Wednesday.Analysts see Q2 earnings per share rising 18% to 52 cents and sales growing 33% to $715.51 million. The company, whose brands include Terra chips, Celestial Seasonings tea and Rice Dream milk substitutes, has turned out EPS and sales gains ranging from the high teens to the upper 30s over the past two years.Hain shares rose 2.4% to 54.05 in the stock market today after testing a recent low Monday morning.On Aug. 20, shares gapped up and finished 11% higher after reporting fourth-quarter results that topped views. After losing and retaking the 50-day line for much of the year, the Q4 report jolted the stock above the line for the next two months. The 50-day line is often a key test of investor support.Shares bounced off the line in October, and rose on Nov. 6 after the company's Q1 EPS topped views and sales missed slightly. The company during that quarter voluntarily recalled Arrowhead Mills nut butters on fears they might have contained salmonella. The stock fell below the line last month. Still, the stock is up 17% since the beginning of 2014.The company has grown through acquisitions as well as online and international sales. As reported here, Hain's U.S. market chief John Carroll said over the summer that Amazon (AMZN) was one of the company's biggest accounts. During the Q1 earnings call in November, CEO Irwin Simon said acquisitions grew revenue by $131 million during the quarter and cited continued strength in the U.K.Amazon shares rose 2.8% Monday.Hain's results come amid a more upbeat analyst sales outlook for natural foods, which are likely to be found in such upscale grocers as Whole Foods (WFM), Sprouts (SFM) and Fresh Market (TFM). Cowen, Sterne Agee and Bank of America analysts in recent weeks have cited consumers' increasing willingness to pay more for presumably healthier, higher-quality products, potentially rewarding those stores and the companies selling there.Still, RBC Capital Markets in December downgraded Hain to sector perform, saying organic sales had slowed domestically. And Zacks noted that the natural foods space has become more crowded, potentially weighing on Hain's Q2 resultsWhole Foods shares closed up 2%, while Sprouts and Fresh Market shares both fell about 0.5%.Hain's products aren't exclusive to higher-end stores and wealthier consumers. They also appear in Chipotle (CMG) restaurants as well as Kroger (KR) and Costco (COST) stores, a reflection of growing health awareness.Kroger shares were up 0.9% while Costco climbed 2.1%.WhiteWave Foods (WWAV), which competes with Hain, reports fourth-quarter and full-year 2014 results on Feb. 12.

Chipotle (CMG) has logged double-digit EPS growth in 15 of the last 16 quarters.Revenue grew 27% to $1.07 billion, just below views for $1.074 billion. That ended a four-quarter string of faster growth. Same-store sales grew 16.1% vs. forecasts for 16.3%.""Same-store sales were essentially in line with Street projections, but Chipotle's valuation had built in a same-store sales beat,"" Sterne Agee analyst Lynne Collier told IBD.Chipotle sees a low- to mid-single-digit comps gain for 2015, a big slowdown but in line with its prior guidance, Collier says.Restaurant-level operating margin widened by 100 basis points to 26.6%, but that was below consensus for 27.6%, Collier says.Food costs were 35% of revenue, an increase of 110 basis points, due primarily to higher dairy and beef costs. A menu price hike last summer partially offset that.Chipotle stock fell 7% in late trading. Ahead of results, shares rose 1.6% to 726.63, a record close.Same-store sales growth was driven primarily by an increase in customer visits, as well as the menu price increase.Chipotle Still 'Unmatched'Missing the Street's lofty expectations doesn't change Collier's view of Chipotle.""Their same-store sales numbers are unmatched by anyone in the industry,"" she said. ""They have an incredible opportunity for unit growth in the U.S. and internationally as well.""Chipotle expects 190 to 205 restaurant openings in 2015.Brian Sozzi, CEO of Belus Capital Advisors, is also upbeat. As long as Yum Brands (YUM) and McDonald's (MCD) ""continue to struggle, it means that Chipotle is doing very well.""Diners who used to go to McDonald's and other fast-food chains, he adds, are ""obsessed with Chipotle.""Brand Image Key""There is a fundamental movement across the country toward health and wellness within the fast-food industry that's very much being spurred on by what Chipotle continues to do,"" he said. ""They have no genetically modified organisms (in the food) on their menu. They're way out in front of this social issue that's really a big deal and that nobody else has tackled yet. The ingredients that Chipotle uses are far superior than what you find in McDonald's, Burger King or Wendy's (WEN).""Chipotle recently pulled pork from some locations, saying some suppliers hadn't lived up to its standards for animal treatment. While that could hurt sales, it also bolsters its brand.Sozzi says Chipotle has strong traffic from lunch to dinner.""The lines never seem to ease until the doors are scheduled to close,"" he adds. ""There's no one in fast food that could around the clock have long lines and with people willing to spend $10 to $15 for lunch.""Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) reports Q4 financials Thursday. Super Bowl traffic and sales will not be included. But it was likely a super day for the sports bar and eatery, as both New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks fans gathered at Buffalo Wild Wings eateries to cheer on their teams and chow down on chicken wings, beer and other tasty fare.

1632,CMG,"THE BUZZAmericans love their hamburgers and are about to be dished up a tasty IPO of fast-casual restaurant chain Shake Shack.Burger chains are the largest dine-out segment in the U.S., with more than $77 billion in 2014 sales, according to research firm Technomic. The burger industry is estimated to be twice the size of the pizza market, which is the next largest category.While McDonald's (MCD) and other international burger chains take the biggest bite out of sales, the fast-casual segment is booming, with annual sales growing at double-digit rates. Among the giants in the fast-casual space are Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and Panera Bread (PNRA).Shake Shack (SHAK), which serves premium burgers, hot dogs, fries, shakes, frozen custard, beer and wine, is attracting lots of buzz with its upcoming IPO.On Wednesday it raised the initial public offering price to a range of 17 to 19 a share, up from 14 to 16. It plans to sell 5 million shares and raise about $90 million. The shares are set to price Thursday and begin trading Friday on the NYSE.Research firm IPOboutique said its channel checks indicate strong demand for Shake Shack stock among institutional investors.""It's a fast-growth story,"" said Jeff Zell, research analyst at IPOboutique. ""Almost all of the fast-casual restaurant deals in the past year have all popped above their offering price.""The latest IPO in the fast-casual space was Habit Restaurants (HABT). It soared 120% from an IPO price of 18 on its first trading day, Nov. 20, and raised $90 million. The stock hit a high of 44.20 on Dec. 12, but has since fallen to near 32.Another is El Pollo Loco (LOCO), which popped 60% from an IPO price of 15 on its first trading day, July 25, and is now near 25. One additional recently public name is Zoe's Kitchen (ZOES), which now trades at more than double its early-April IPO price of 15.THE COMPANYShake Shack started out as a hot-dog cart in 2001 in New York City's Madison Square Park as the park was getting a revamp. The food was an instant hit, receiving widespread media attention and long lines of customers.The first official Shake Shack eatery then opened in 2004 as a kiosk in the park .The company started serving burgers and has since grown to 63 Shacks, of which 27 are licensed Shake Shack restaurants operating in offshore markets. Twenty operate in the Middle East. Shake Shack operates in 10 Eastern U.S. states and Washington, D.C. Fifteen of its restaurant locations are in New York.The company plans to open at least 10 new Shacks each year for the foreseeable future. Over the long-term it sees the market potential to operate least 450 Shake Shacks. On average, each store produces annual revenue of about $5 million.""Over the last decade, Shake Shack has become a beloved New York City institution that generates significant media attention, critical acclaim and a passionately devoted following,"" the company states in its IPO prospectus.In its IPO filing, Shake Shack continually describes creating an experience — a word often used in the prospectus to define its success.""We never stop looking for the best culinary ingredients and the best partners in order to exceed our guests' expectations in every aspect of their experience,"" it said, for example.Shake Shack, while passionate about providing customers a compelling experience, is equally dedicated to employees.""Through our leadership development program, The Shacksperience, we teach our team members the principles of Enlightened Hospitality and how to live and breathe our Shack Pact, the agreement that encompasses our value system and brand ethos,"" it said in the filing.RISKS/CHALLENGESThe restaurant industry is highly competitive and fragmented, with various regions having highly dedicated customers.""Some of our competitors, including some of our 'better burger' competitors, have significantly greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do, and many of our competitors are well-established in markets in which we have existing Shacks or intend to locate new Shacks,"" Shake Shack said.The fast-casual dining segment has, on average, seen sales growth in the double-digit rates for the past 15 years, according to Technomic.The fast-casual restaurant segment in total took in revenue of about $38.5 billion in 2014. Sales in the burger category are around $3 billion.The largest competitor in the fast-casual space that focuses on hamburgers is Five Guys, which is based in Alexandria, Va. Five Guys has more than 1,000 shops and revenue of about $1 billion, said Darren Tristano, executive vice president at Technomic.In second is Denver-based Smashburger, with about 300 outlets.Shake Shack, which is small in comparison, faces a formidable group of competitors.""Shake Shack is late to game,"" said Tristano. ""Their customers say it's a great burger experience, but today there are a lot of good burgers.""He added: ""The burger market continues to do well, but it's also maturing. A lot more burger chains are opening up as we speak.""Shake Shack has been cautiously methodical in its expansion. ""We are still in the very nascent stage of our story,"" it said.THE RESULTSFor the 39-week period ended Sept. 24, Shake Shack reported revenue of $83.8 million, up 41% from the $59.5 million reported in the year-earlier period. Net income fell 20% to $3.54 million.Shake Shack reported revenue of $31.8 million in the third quarter, up 40% from the year-earlier period, and income from operations of $759,000.PROCEEDSShake Shack expects to receive $83.7 million in net proceeds and will use that to repay debt of $36 million. Another $44.7 million will be used for general corporate purposes, including the opening of new Shake Shacks and renovation of existing shops.MANAGEMENTDaniel MeyerChairmanMeyer, 56, has served as chairman since its formation.

1749,CMG,"El Pollo Loco (LOCO) continues to grow quickly as it expands store count, profit margins rise and it eyes expansion overseas and new brands.Robert W. Baird analyst David Tarantino cited those factors for his upgrade of its stock to outperform from neutral Monday, with an unchanged 34 price target.Tarantino said the company's strengths include healthy return on invested capital and an experienced management team.""We continue to have a high degree of confidence in the near- and long-term growth outlook,"" Tarantino said in a client note.Tarantino says the risk-reward ratio for the company has improved following its recent sharp 48% pullback from Nov. 7, a day after it announced third-quarter earnings that just met views, to a Dec. 31 low of 19.97.El Pollo Loco launched its initial public offering July 25 after pricing at 15 per share.

1750,CMG,"Restaurant stocks are expected to continue their strong performance in 2015 thanks to a trio of favorable trends, with Dunkin' Brands Group (DNKN) and Panera Bread (PNRA) expected to share top billing alongside current industry stalwarts Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD).IBD's Retail-Restaurant group already ranks No. 5 among the 197 industries tracked by IBD and has placed among the top 10 groups for the last eight weeks.It should continue to shine in 2015, experts say, as the industry benefits from the following tail winds: Lower gas prices, which give consumers more spending money to eat out. An improving economy and job market, which give consumers more confidence to spend discretionary money on purchases like dining out. Easier year-over-year comparisons, which means restaurant operators won't have to work as hard to post the kinds of numbers investors like.""As 2015 begins, we revise our outlook to better than 'glass-half-full', particularly as the consumer environment improves and the industry faces easier year-over-year sales comparisons in the next two to four quarters,"" Miller Tabak analyst Stephen Anderson noted in a Monday report.He estimates that industrywide same-restaurant sales increased 0.8% in 2014 and expects that figure to tick further up this year.""Considering our outlook for an improving picture for jobs and discretionary income, as well as fuel prices that we think will remain considerably below $3/gallon in 2015, we think 2015 comps for casual dining will average 1.5% to 2.0% (growth), traditional quick-service restaurants will average 2% to 3%, and fast casual restaurants will average 3% to 4%,"" Anderson noted.His top picks for the year — those that ""will see the most upside in 2015"" — are Dunkin' Brands and Panera, with Dunkin' taking the No. 1 spot.Dunkin' has an IBD Composite Rating of 87, while Panera has a Composite Rating of 78.The top rated stocks in the restaurant group are Buffalo Wild Wings, Chipotle and Nathan's Famous (NATH), each of which has a 99 Composite Rating.

"
1802,CMG,"Van Winkle credits management for working efficiently through good and tough times. In Hain's September-ending first quarter — which included its voluntary nut-butter recall in August — Hain grew earnings and revenue more than 30% vs. the year-earlier period.

"
1814,CMG,"Hain competes with numerous companies. They range from small organic and natural-foods players to the big packaged-goods giants that have increasingly been adding healthier products to their mix.
"
1815,CMG,"General Mills (GIS), for example, acquired organic snack and convenient-meals provider Annie's Homegrown in October. Campbell Soup (CPB) bought organic baby products company Plum Organics in 2013.
"
1816,CMG,"""Dozens if not hundreds of companies are their competitors,"" Van Winkle said. ""This isn't General Mills against Kellogg (K) in the cereal aisle. This is a multibrand company in a rising category.""

"
1820,CMG,"The U.K. is Hain's second largest market after the U.S. Second-quarter net sales in the U.K. jumped 38% vs. the year prior to $200.8 million. Tilda contributed around $50 million of the total, even with the ongoing production disruption from the fire.

""And given that Hain is a multibrand, multicategory business, it is going to participate in the growth across all channels.""CEO Simon likes to say that his company has brand offerings in 10 of the top 15 highest-penetrated organic and natural product categories. Plus, he says, it has more than 500 gluten-free products.Van Winkle credits management for working efficiently through good and tough times. In Hain's September-ending first quarter — which included its voluntary nut-butter recall in August — Hain grew earnings and revenue more than 30% vs. the year-earlier period.And second-quarter earnings beat views despite interrupted production from fire damage at its Tilda specialty-rice factory in the U.K. in late October, which contributed to slower than expected sales.Hain lowered its full-year outlook to reflect the multiple headwinds, including a $70 million impact from weaker foreign currencies and $20 million from the nut butter recall and fire.The firm expects total net sales for the year ending in June of $2.650-$2.675 billion, up 23% to 24% over the prior fiscal year. Earnings are seen rising 17%-19% to $1.85-$1.89 per share.Analysts see revenue growing 24% to $2.671 billion and earnings going up 18% to $1.88, according to a poll by Thomson Reuters.""The recall is behind them at this point,"" Van Winkle said. ""But the manufacturing challenges from the fire at the Tilda facility are going to take a few quarters to work through.""Hain bought U.K.-based Basmati and specialty-rice company Tilda in January 2014. It was one of numerous acquisitions made since its founding in 1993 and the first of three in 2014.The other two last year were Rudi's Organic Bakery and the 51.3% interest that it didn't already own in organic poultry brands FreeBird and Plainville Farms — part of its Hain Pure Protein subsidiary.High-Profile CustomersHain Pure Protein sells to Panera Bread (PNRA) and Chipotle (CMG), among other customers.""Hain's ability to complete accretive and synergistic M&As (mergers and acquisitions) has been a key reason for its success in recent years,"" said David Palmer, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, in a research note on Feb. 5.As one example, Palmer noted that sales of snack-focused Sensible Portions, which Hain acquired in 2010, grew 51% for the 12-week period ending January 2. That was up from 42% growth in the prior 12-week period.Hain competes with numerous companies. They range from small organic and natural-foods players to the big packaged-goods giants that have increasingly been adding healthier products to their mix.General Mills (GIS), for example, acquired organic snack and convenient-meals provider Annie's Homegrown in October. Campbell Soup (CPB) bought organic baby products company Plum Organics in 2013.""Dozens if not hundreds of companies are their competitors,"" Van Winkle said. ""This isn't General Mills against Kellogg (K) in the cereal aisle. This is a multibrand company in a rising category.""WhiteWave Foods (WWAV), for instance, is a rival in soy milk and organic dairy milk.Traditional supermarkets such as Safeway and Kroger (KR), mass merchants Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT), and natural-organic grocer Whole Foods (WFM) and others in its category carry Hain products.Hain's largest single customer is United Natural Foods (UNFI), a distributor to Whole Foods and other stores. Hain's products are sold in more than 65 countries.The U.K. is Hain's second largest market after the U.S. Second-quarter net sales in the U.K. jumped 38% vs. the year prior to $200.8 million. Tilda contributed around $50 million of the total, even with the ongoing production disruption from the fire.U.S. net sales rose 8% to $354 million. The nut-butter recall cut into sales by $5.3 million. Rudi's added $16.1 million.Hain saw double-digit growth in several brands, including Sensible Portions, The Greek Gods, Terra, Garden of Eatin', Imagine and WestSoy, among others.In a Q2 conference call on Feb. 4, Simon said that business had been strong in January. He alluded to cold-weather favorites such as tea, soup and snacks.""We love cold weather and we love snowstorms,"" he said.

The Pantry is in IBD's Retail-Supermarket/Mini Markets industry group, ranked No. 27 out of 197.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) may be setting up in a new base, but it's not without problems.The base is a double bottom with handle and a 675.34 buy point, part of a base-on-base formation going back to March.One of the problems with the base is the lack of accumulation, as shown in the Accumulation/Distribution Rating. The stock gapped down 7% on Oct. 21 in reaction to an earnings report. Volume was the heaviest of the base.The 7% down day turned out to be the base's bottom, but the recovery has been mostly on below-average volume. Also, Chipotle has made a big move since bottoming in 2008.The Restaurants-Retail industry group is ranked No. 10 out of 197 groups as of Thursday's IBD.A newcomer in the fast-casual dining space is Fiesta Restaurant Group (FRGI), which has 329 Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana restaurants in the U.S., the Caribbean and Central and South America.The stock, showcased in this column in Thursday's paper, has moved out of a short consolidation and is trading near an all-time high.

1890,CMG,"Small-cap stocks, by their very nature, are often overlooked. But historically they outperform other asset classes. Small-cap growth stocks can become enormous winners.Today's Screen Of The Day is Small Cap Leaders, which includes top-rated companies with a market capitalization of $300 million to $2 billion.Today's list includes four hot restaurants with tasty returns.With low gas prices pumping more cash into consumers' pockets, restaurants are cooking. The Retail-Restaurants group is ranked an outstanding 12th on IBD's list of 197 industries.Cracker Barrel (CBRL), which doesn't even make the Small Cap Leaders menu, late last month reported outstanding earnings and sales growth that topped views, helped by lower gas prices that drove more diners to its highway locations.Wunderlich restaurant analyst Bob Derrington said in a recent report that with plunging fuel prices consumers are more inclined to treat themselves to a meal at their favorite restaurant.Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) is No. 4 on the Small Cap Leaders list. Derrington raised his rating on the casual restaurant chain late last month. Citing improving sales and profit trends he raised his Q4 earnings-per-share estimate to $1.12 from $1.03 and reiterated a buy rating.The chain known for its buffalo wings and sports theme has been a steady performer, climbing 138% in the last two years.It formed a deep cup-with-handle base from late July to late November. It rose above a 164.58 buy point and just kept going. Its stock, which is also on the IBD 50 list of top-rated stocks, rose 2.9% on Wednesday to 172.55, an all-time high.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) is No. 5 on the list. The operator of more than 420 full-service restaurants serves steaks, ribs, fish and chicken items ranging from $9.99 to $24.99. Its stock moved sideways for most of the year, riding its 50-day and 200-day lines up and down in a narrow range.Texas Roadhouse cleared a short consolidation in late August, moved sideways, then found support at the 50-day line in late October. It jumped nearly 6% on Nov. 4 following its latest earnings report. Shares hit a record high of 33.43 on Nov. 28. It's held steady near that level in December and closed up 1.7% Wednesday at 32.78 in stock market trading.Jack in the Box (JACK), known for its TV ads featuring an executive with a clown head, features a wide variety of value-priced fast-food items. Jack in the Box is another top pick for Wunderlich's Derrington.Although it mainly competes with McDonald's (MCD) with burgers and fries, the company also plays in the popular Mexican food sector with its Qdoba Mexican Grill franchise. Qdoba competes with highly rated fast-casual giant Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG).Jack in the Box stock formed a cup-with-handle base from March 18 to Aug. 7, when it crossed above a 62.07 buy point following an earnings report. Shares moved sideways for another month before beginning a steady climb. In its latest run it's generally found support at its 10-day or 21-day lines, bullish support levels. Shares rose 1.9% Wednesday at 77.68, close to last week's record high.Sonic (SONC), a fast-food chain, has reported double-digit profit increases for 11 quarters in a row. Analysts project that it will continue that streak this year. Sales have been less impressive, rising 4% and 3% in its last two quarters.Sonic cleared a consolidation in late October, leaving its old base for good on Oct. 21, a day after its latest earnings report. The stock peaked at 29.97 on Dec. 2 and Dec. 3. Sonic slid less than 1% Wednesday to 26.30.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar.

1955,CMG,"Will lower poultry prices lift high-flyer Buffalo Wild Wings in the already-hot restaurants industry group? Chances are that they can.
"
1956,CMG,"That's the opinion of Wunderlich Securities analyst Robert Derrington, who has raised his earnings outlook and price target for the highly-rated sports bar and eatery, based on an improved outlook on poultry prices.
"
1957,CMG,"""Key poultry indices have declined to their lowest level since March 2014 and could continue to trend lower as favorable grain prices provide a supportive backdrop for producers,"" Derrington noted in a report citing his commodity sources.
"
1958,CMG,"The improving trend prompted him to raise his Q4 EPS estimate for Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) to $1.12 from $1.03 and his full-year 2014 EPS to $5.00 from $4.92. He also increased his price target to 185 and reiterated his buy rating on the stock.
"
1959,CMG,"His revised outlook comes following word from the U.S. Department of Agriculture this week that it has raised its 2015 chicken production forecast by its largest amount in five years and its second largest since 2004. Derrington says that his commodity sources suggest the increase could actually be up as much as 4%, ""adding the potential for even more favorable poultry prices in 2015.""
"
1960,CMG,"He notes that chicken wing prices have declined 15 cents per pound in the last two weeks. His sources also suggest that even lower prices are likely and that recent peak wing prices this fall could prove to be the peak for the next several years. ""If so, that could mitigate BWLD's chief source of earnings and share price volatility,"" Derrington noted. ""With an improving poultry (wings) outlook combined with 3% higher menu pricing (at Buffalo Wild Wings), we project 2014 and 2015 margins to improve vs. our prior estimates.""
"
1961,CMG,"Derrington increased his estimate for the company's Q4 restaurant margin to 17.9% from 17.3%.

He also increased his price target to 185 and reiterated his buy rating on the stock.His revised outlook comes following word from the U.S. Department of Agriculture this week that it has raised its 2015 chicken production forecast by its largest amount in five years and its second largest since 2004. Derrington says that his commodity sources suggest the increase could actually be up as much as 4%, ""adding the potential for even more favorable poultry prices in 2015.""He notes that chicken wing prices have declined 15 cents per pound in the last two weeks. His sources also suggest that even lower prices are likely and that recent peak wing prices this fall could prove to be the peak for the next several years. ""If so, that could mitigate BWLD's chief source of earnings and share price volatility,"" Derrington noted. ""With an improving poultry (wings) outlook combined with 3% higher menu pricing (at Buffalo Wild Wings), we project 2014 and 2015 margins to improve vs. our prior estimates.""Derrington increased his estimate for the company's Q4 restaurant margin to 17.9% from 17.3%.Buffalo Wild Wings is part of IBD's Retail-Restaurants industry group, which ranks No. 8 out of 197 industry groups that IBD tracks. The stock gets a high IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of a possible 99, factoring in statistics such as earnings growth and long-term stock price gains.The group also includes IBD 50 stock Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), which has the group's top Composite Rating of 99, as do Nathan's Famous (NATH) and Texas Roadhouse (TXRH).

"
1981,CMG,"Habit's focus on burgers doesn't just put it up against other fast-casual chains.

The list includes the five companies that are projected to show the fastest earnings growth this quarter. Avago Technologies (AVGO), a Singapore-based…
"
2135,CMG,"Jason Weiner is like Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers.
"
2136,CMG,"Season after season, he keeps performing at a high level.
"
2137,CMG,"Since Feb. 2, 2007, when Weiner became the signal caller for the now $1.3 billion Fidelity Growth Discovery Fund and its adviser-sold twin $2.8 billion Advisor Equity Growth Fund , Growth Discovery has notched an 8.48% average annual gain vs. 7.03% for the S&P 500. Its performance ranks in the top 30% of its large-cap growth peers, tracked by Morningstar Inc.
"
2138,CMG,"Weiner has used the same approach for most if not all of his tenure, he says. He seeks undervalued growth stories and stocks with potential for price-earnings expansion, avoiding overly costly names.
"
2139,CMG,"Weiner, 45 years old, talked with IBD from his office in Boston about how he invests.
"
2140,CMG,"IBD: Jason, if you ever had a mentor, who was it?
"
2141,CMG,"Weiner: I've had tons of mentors. On the rare occasions when (Fidelity) rolls me out to meet MBAs visiting Fidelity, I tell them they should find a mentor, either outside their workplace or inside, or preferably both.
"
2142,CMG,"It's super important, going back to when I was 15 and had my first job. I got it from a family friend, Lou, who was a great influence. It was Lou Nargiso, and he owned a gas station-auto repair shop. He was a World War II vet, and he learned auto repair in the army.
"
2143,CMG,"He was a very well-educated person and philosophical. He liked to debate things. Everyone who worked for Lou was very loyal to him, as was he to them. His shop was also kind of a clubhouse for his World War II vet buddies, and I hung out with them. Good times!
"
2144,CMG,"IBD: And at Fidelity?
"
2145,CMG,"Weiner: At Fidelity, Will Danoff (manager of Fidelity's $111.1 billion Contrafund , $28.9 billion Advisor New Insights , $6.4 billion Series Opportunistic Insights and $884.8 million Advisor Series Opportunistic Insights has been a great mentor.
"
2146,CMG,"I don't remember exactly when it kicked off. It might have been around 1993. We were both on a train. Will was going to southern Connecticut, visiting his parents. We sat next to each other. I worked for him later. I gained a lot of wisdom. Will is super focused on studying each decade, understanding monster stocks in each decade, and being in the elephant-hunting business — hunting stocks that go on to make monster gains.
"
2147,CMG,"If you owned Dell in 1990, for the next 10 years nothing else mattered. It's the beauty of incredible growth stories. Will was focused on that, and I have adopted that strategy.
"
2148,CMG,"IBD: Overall, you look for undervalued growth stories and stocks with potential for price-earnings expansion, right?
"
2149,CMG,"Weiner: You only get paid for two things with growth stocks. First, for P-E expansion. Second, for underlying earnings growth of the companies you invest in.
"
2150,CMG,"Typically, I focus on the growth rate of companies. That's where fundamental research can bring value. And I try to leverage Fidelity's research engine a lot.
"
2151,CMG,"It's a little harder to predict P-E.
"
2152,CMG,"IBD: And you try to avoid valuations that are too high, correct?
"
2153,CMG,"Weiner: If you can enter a name you like when there's controversy or doubt that casts its P-E lower, that's a great opportunity.
"
2154,CMG,"IBD: Give me an example, please.
"
2155,CMG,"Weiner: The best in recent years is Facebook (FB), after Facebook botched its IPO.
"
2156,CMG,"The stock had gone public (at 38) and traded down immediately. It bottomed around 17 even though the company was doing great. But there were clouds of controversy that pummeled the stock.
"
2157,CMG,"I bought after the IPO. I didn't buy it all on one day. My (average price per share) was in the 20s.
"
2158,CMG,"While the stock was going down, the company was rolling out newsfeed ads. It seems like ancient history, but newsfeed ads are relatively new. About the time of the IPO, they stopped relying on ads for PC-based service and shifted to newsfeed ads that appeared on mobile devices. It was a fundamental transformation of their business model. That's Facebook's story today.
"
2159,CMG,"IBD: Should people think of Growth Discovery as a GARP (growth at a reasonable price) strategy?
"
2160,CMG,"Weiner: A lot of the fund would be recognizable as a GARP basket. That's OK. But in addition, I try to buy the best growth names in the market, the ones that are going to turn into big, sustainable, valuable franchises. That's a little different from GARP.
"
2161,CMG,"My top 40 names are 65% of my assets. Not every name will become a brand-new, unbelievable franchise. Some already have great franchises. Some will become great. But if you look at every decade — and I know this from some of the publications that William O'Neil sends me — in the '60s, '70s, '80s, '90s and so on, and look at the monster stocks, there are never that many. I try to buy those sorts of names.
"
2162,CMG,"IBD: You are allowed to invest in any market-cap size, but the fund has been large-cap oriented for a long time. Its heaviest weighting was in megacaps as of Sept. 30. Why those, why U.S. ones?
"
2163,CMG,"Weiner: Let's take the U.S. piece first. The U.S. economy is doing better than the average developed nation's, so it's fortuitous to be U.S. investors in this day.
"
2164,CMG,"And why so many megacaps? If you look at Internet models, the (successful) ones are global, scalable, enjoy incredible network effects and are viral. That's what we want.
"
2165,CMG,"I point to Facebook. The biggest companies, like that, enjoy increased returns as they get bigger.
"
2166,CMG,"If you were a manufacturer 50 years ago, you might have experienced decreasing returns for every single additional widget you made. They had to be sold at lower margins to incent the market to buy your product. In the Internet age, it's the opposite: increased returns.
"
2167,CMG,"The other thing about the Internet is that it's a winner-takes-the-most dynamic. Google (GOOGL) is the leader in search. That is a winner-takes-all battle, and they won.
"
2168,CMG,"It's to be determined in the OTA (online travel agency) space. You've got Facebook, Expedia (EXPE), TripAdvisor (TRIP) and a bunch of other ones. (This may also turn into a winner-takes-all space.) That's why we haven't invested in Priceline (PCLN). I have no skin in that game.
"
2169,CMG,"IBD: Why did you boost your Apple (AAPL) weighting to 5.8% as of Oct. 31 from less than 1% as of March 31 and 2.3% as of June 30?
"
2170,CMG,"Weiner: Full disclosure: I have not done a great job trading Apple in the last five years. I give myself low marks on that one. I can make a long list of Apple's positives and negatives. I've focused on the negatives in the last five years. I'm not going to do that any more.
"
2171,CMG,"I live two blocks from an Apple store. When the iPhone 6 came out there was a line around the block. It was crazy. I can't ignore that.
"
2172,CMG,"I could lecture about how smartphones are fully penetrated and the rate of innovation is slowing down. And how Android has outshipped Apple iOS five to one and usually the volume leader wins in tech. Actually, it always does! But the negatives haven't mattered (to Apple's stock performance).
"
2173,CMG,"IBD: So you've decided — at least for the moment — that all is not lost for Apple?
"
2174,CMG,"Weiner: One of the key buckets of stock I've avoided is large-cap tech legacy players: Oracle (ORCL), EMC (EMC), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Microsoft (MSFT) and on and on. I generally underweight them. I'm mindful that they have secular challenges. When that happens, you never know if they will catch up. IBM (IBM) for years faced them but somehow always punched out good earnings. But that may be changing. Last quarter was terrible for them.
"
2175,CMG,"When secular challenges catch up to a company, it's all over. In the 1990s, I was a tech analyst covering Compaq, Tandem, Digital, Stratus, Data General. They faced secular challenges. When the wave hit, they fell over. They don't exist now (as independent companies).
"
2176,CMG,"Apple is a huge, good legacy story relative to other legacy players. That's another justification for owning Apple.
"
2177,CMG,"IBD: You held Illumina (ILMN) as of Oct. 31. You're a fan of the outlook for gene sequencing, right?
"
2178,CMG,"Weiner: Yes. Illumina is an incredible company, helping to unlock the secrets of sequencing genomes for just $1,000. The way we practice medicine is changing because of companies like Illumina.
"
2179,CMG,"If you look backwards, people were doing one human genome. Now they're sequencing thousands. In the future, you will have your genome when you go to the doctor. That's where Illumina comes in.
"
2180,CMG,"IBD: Will Alexion (ALXN) remain a play on a single drug, Soliris?
"
2181,CMG,"Weiner: My Alexion thesis (as of my latest disclosure) was this: they are a super orphan-drug company. They only go after indications with small patient populations, where they get a lot of money for life-saving drugs.
"
2182,CMG,"They've increased the number of indications Soliris is sold for. And behind that there is another drug they're hoping for FDA approval for, for a new set of indications.
"
2183,CMG,"It's hard for society to say it will not pay for a drug, and your child will live for only a couple of years. If society pays for the drug, your child will have a normal outcome. It's a big ethics debate. But bottom line: countries are paying for these drugs.
"
2184,CMG,"IBD: How similar is Gilead's (GILD) story?
"
2185,CMG,"Weiner: They have great risk-reward. They beat the competition. There will be others with cures for hepatitis C. They will get market share. But Gilead will get the majority market share. If you have hep C, you want this drug immediately.
"
2186,CMG,"One knock against the drug is that some people don't like to invest in companies that cure a disease. Then the treatment is a one-shot deal. Some people say, 'Isn't it better to develop a treatment for HIV that requires patients to take a pill every day?' But there's still plenty of room for the hep C drug. There are millions of patients who don't have the drug yet.
"
2187,CMG,"IBD: Chipotle's (CMG) earnings growth has accelerated for two quarters.
"
2188,CMG,"Weiner: It's a great franchise with tons of room for growth. The secret is that people will pay more for food that they think is higher quality.
"
2189,CMG,"IBD: What about Sherwin-Williams (SHW)?
"
2190,CMG,"Weiner: This is one of the greatest companies that nobody recognizes.
"
2191,CMG,"Their paint store franchise is so valuable. They're vertically integrated. Professional painters make their first daily stop at Sherwin-Williams, not Home Depot (HD) or Lowe's (LOW). They know how to treat pros. They have lots of pricing power. Material costs are not a big deal. Most (end users) are people restoring or remodeling homes. It does not depend on home sales.
"
2192,CMG,"IBD: What drives Ulta Beauty (ULTA)?
"
2193,CMG,"Weiner: What I like about Ulta is that beauty has high emotional content for women. Ulta gives them the ability to walk into a mall-based, completely dedicated beauty retailer and not have to walk halfway across a department store to get to a beauty counter. And Ulta has a growing number of prestige brands. Years ago, prestige brands wouldn't sell through them. Now they do.
"
2194,CMG,"Beauty products have high margins. Profits, same-store sales, sales per square foot are all growing.
"
2195,CMG,"Last year, profits had actually been muted. The CEO (Mary Dillon) is investing heavily in e-commerce. She told a credible story to the Street about what her investments can do, so people are on board.
"
2196,CMG,"IBD: You were a fan of Alibaba (BABA) as of your latest disclosure, right?
"
2197,CMG,"Weiner: Alibaba is like the legend with that name. In 100 years, people will talk about (CEO) Jack Ma in those terms. This is the e-commerce leader in China. Full stop. China is a big market that is growing.
"
2198,CMG,"Jack Ma has done a very good job of building a huge business with massive gross merchandise value. He's attracted merchants with a low take rate. That means for a small or medium business, Alibaba is a great tool to grow your business.
"
2199,CMG,"He also has G Mall, the place where global brands can sell in a safe place where there are no counterfeits there.
"
2200,CMG,"And he's got payments and financial services in his back pocket.
"
2201,CMG,"Alibaba's gross merchandise value is larger than Amazon (AMZN) and eBay's (EBAY) combined.Jason Weiner is like Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers.Season after season, he keeps performing at a high level.Since Feb. 2, 2007, when Weiner became the signal caller for the now $1.3 billion Fidelity Growth Discovery Fund and its adviser-sold twin $2.8 billion Advisor Equity Growth Fund , Growth Discovery has notched an 8.48% average annual gain vs. 7.03% for the S&P 500.

If you look at Internet models, the (successful) ones are global, scalable, enjoy incredible network effects and are viral. That's what we want.I point to Facebook. The biggest companies, like that, enjoy increased returns as they get bigger.If you were a manufacturer 50 years ago, you might have experienced decreasing returns for every single additional widget you made. They had to be sold at lower margins to incent the market to buy your product. In the Internet age, it's the opposite: increased returns.The other thing about the Internet is that it's a winner-takes-the-most dynamic. Google (GOOGL) is the leader in search. That is a winner-takes-all battle, and they won.It's to be determined in the OTA (online travel agency) space. You've got Facebook, Expedia (EXPE), TripAdvisor (TRIP) and a bunch of other ones. (This may also turn into a winner-takes-all space.) That's why we haven't invested in Priceline (PCLN). I have no skin in that game.IBD: Why did you boost your Apple (AAPL) weighting to 5.8% as of Oct. 31 from less than 1% as of March 31 and 2.3% as of June 30?Weiner: Full disclosure: I have not done a great job trading Apple in the last five years. I give myself low marks on that one. I can make a long list of Apple's positives and negatives. I've focused on the negatives in the last five years. I'm not going to do that any more.I live two blocks from an Apple store. When the iPhone 6 came out there was a line around the block. It was crazy. I can't ignore that.I could lecture about how smartphones are fully penetrated and the rate of innovation is slowing down. And how Android has outshipped Apple iOS five to one and usually the volume leader wins in tech. Actually, it always does! But the negatives haven't mattered (to Apple's stock performance).IBD: So you've decided — at least for the moment — that all is not lost for Apple?Weiner: One of the key buckets of stock I've avoided is large-cap tech legacy players: Oracle (ORCL), EMC (EMC), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Microsoft (MSFT) and on and on. I generally underweight them. I'm mindful that they have secular challenges. When that happens, you never know if they will catch up. IBM (IBM) for years faced them but somehow always punched out good earnings. But that may be changing. Last quarter was terrible for them.When secular challenges catch up to a company, it's all over. In the 1990s, I was a tech analyst covering Compaq, Tandem, Digital, Stratus, Data General. They faced secular challenges. When the wave hit, they fell over. They don't exist now (as independent companies).Apple is a huge, good legacy story relative to other legacy players. That's another justification for owning Apple.IBD: You held Illumina (ILMN) as of Oct. 31. You're a fan of the outlook for gene sequencing, right?Weiner: Yes. Illumina is an incredible company, helping to unlock the secrets of sequencing genomes for just $1,000. The way we practice medicine is changing because of companies like Illumina.If you look backwards, people were doing one human genome. Now they're sequencing thousands. In the future, you will have your genome when you go to the doctor. That's where Illumina comes in.IBD: Will Alexion (ALXN) remain a play on a single drug, Soliris?Weiner: My Alexion thesis (as of my latest disclosure) was this: they are a super orphan-drug company. They only go after indications with small patient populations, where they get a lot of money for life-saving drugs.They've increased the number of indications Soliris is sold for. And behind that there is another drug they're hoping for FDA approval for, for a new set of indications.It's hard for society to say it will not pay for a drug, and your child will live for only a couple of years. If society pays for the drug, your child will have a normal outcome. It's a big ethics debate. But bottom line: countries are paying for these drugs.IBD: How similar is Gilead's (GILD) story?Weiner: They have great risk-reward. They beat the competition. There will be others with cures for hepatitis C. They will get market share. But Gilead will get the majority market share. If you have hep C, you want this drug immediately.One knock against the drug is that some people don't like to invest in companies that cure a disease. Then the treatment is a one-shot deal. Some people say, 'Isn't it better to develop a treatment for HIV that requires patients to take a pill every day?' But there's still plenty of room for the hep C drug. There are millions of patients who don't have the drug yet.IBD: Chipotle's (CMG) earnings growth has accelerated for two quarters.Weiner: It's a great franchise with tons of room for growth. The secret is that people will pay more for food that they think is higher quality.IBD: What about Sherwin-Williams (SHW)?Weiner: This is one of the greatest companies that nobody recognizes.Their paint store franchise is so valuable. They're vertically integrated. Professional painters make their first daily stop at Sherwin-Williams, not Home Depot (HD) or Lowe's (LOW). They know how to treat pros. They have lots of pricing power. Material costs are not a big deal. Most (end users) are people restoring or remodeling homes. It does not depend on home sales.IBD: What drives Ulta Beauty (ULTA)?Weiner: What I like about Ulta is that beauty has high emotional content for women. Ulta gives them the ability to walk into a mall-based, completely dedicated beauty retailer and not have to walk halfway across a department store to get to a beauty counter. And Ulta has a growing number of prestige brands. Years ago, prestige brands wouldn't sell through them. Now they do.Beauty products have high margins. Profits, same-store sales, sales per square foot are all growing.Last year, profits had actually been muted. The CEO (Mary Dillon) is investing heavily in e-commerce. She told a credible story to the Street about what her investments can do, so people are on board.IBD: You were a fan of Alibaba (BABA) as of your latest disclosure, right?Weiner: Alibaba is like the legend with that name. In 100 years, people will talk about (CEO) Jack Ma in those terms. This is the e-commerce leader in China. Full stop. China is a big market that is growing.Jack Ma has done a very good job of building a huge business with massive gross merchandise value. He's attracted merchants with a low take rate. That means for a small or medium business, Alibaba is a great tool to grow your business.He also has G Mall, the place where global brands can sell in a safe place where there are no counterfeits there.And he's got payments and financial services in his back pocket.Alibaba's gross merchandise value is larger than Amazon (AMZN) and eBay's (EBAY) combined.

2228,CMG,"Chipotle Mexican Grill's stock is near all-time highs, but Wall Street still underestimates — and underappreciates — the company when it comes to margin potential and boosting traffic, says Oppenheimer analyst Brian Bitter.Bitter raised his price target on Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) to 775 from 700 and reiterated an outperform rating in a research report published Wednesday.Shares dipped 0.3% on the stock market today.The fast-casual powerhouse should be able to hit margins of 30% or higher, according to Bitter, as the full effect of price hikes takes hold.Chipotle rapidly responded to escalating commodity pressure by raising prices in April by an average of 5%-6%, with beef getting hit by the most aggressive increases. Despite the hikes, customer traffic remained strong.But the Wall Street consensus assumes that Chipotle's margins will stay under 29% ""in perpetuity"" with per-store traffic decelerating in the first half of 2015 due to tough prior-year comps, Bitter notes.""We believe this underappreciates current business momentum, secular shifts within CMG's base, future traffic levers and management's ability to execute during a time when demand is surging,"" he said in the note.Bitter raised his '14 EPS expectation by 11 cents to $13.98 on better margins, while Wall Street sees $13.66. His '15 EPS projection was raised by $1.40-$18.80 vs. the consensus expectation for $17.35.Chipotle has an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of 99, which means that its shares outperform the vast majority of the market as measured by both technical and fundamental factors.The Mexican food chain also holds the top spot within the Retail-Restaurants group, which is ranked No. 93 out of the 197 industries that IBD tracks.Competitor El Pollo Loco (LOCO), a recent IPO, has an IBD Composite Rating of 79 and is ranked No. 13 in the group.El Pollo Loco reported quarterly earnings in line with views and beat revenue expectations last week.

2242,CMG,"Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) on Tuesday clocked a fourth-quarter same-store sales increase that just beat estimates, but the fast-casual Mexican chain sees 2018 comps decelerating from last year.X The forecast comes as analysts wait for new leadership to step in and offer clarity on how the company plans to rebound following a handful of food-safety scares over the past two-or-so years.Chipotle on Tuesday said was making ""good progress"" on its attempts to find a new CEO. The company said in November that it was looking for a new chief executive with ""demonstrated turnaround expertise"" to replace Steve Ells, who founded the company in 1993. Ells, Chipotle said, would become executive chairman once the search concluded.How that progress might sit with Wall Street remains unclear. Cowen analysts said in a research note this month that survey data indicate that Chipotle's ""quality as well as value perceptions are near trough levels both among the general population as well as the brand's core 18-34 year old consumer base.""""Upcoming efforts to improve these measures and in turn drive sales are unclear until a new CEO is hired,"" they added.The company on Tuesday forecast same-store sales gains in the ""low single digits"" this year, compared to a 6.4% boost seen in 2017.In a statement, Ells said that ""while there is still work to be done, we are starting to see some success,"" in the turnaround efforts.For the fourth quarter, Chipotle's same-store sales rose 0.9%, above Consensus Metric forecasts for a 0.7% gain. Revenue rose 7.3% to $1.1 billion, missing estimates for $1.117 billion.Chipotle earned $1.34 per share during the quarter, when factoring out a 21-cent per-share bump it got due to the GOP's tax legislation. That was better than views for $1.33.Shares rose 1.2% after hours in the stock market today, after rising in the minutes following the earnings' release.Taco Bell parent Yum Brands (YUM), which reports Thursday, was unchanged after hours. El Pollo Loco (LOCO) picked up 0.5%. McDonald's (MCD), which reported earnings last week, rose 0.3%.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The company said it planned to invest more than a third of the savings resulting from the Trump tax cuts into its employees. CFO Jack Hartung said Chipotle would make its managers and crew eligible for one-time cash and stock bonuses, and improve other benefits.In the days leading up to Tuesday's earnings, some analysts wondered whether Chipotle would use the occasion to announce a new chief executive.Chipotle's stumbles have resulted in Monty Moran's departure from the role of co-CEO in 2016. The company has also shaken up its board and spent more to strengthen its safety standards. It has focused on new menu products and ways to improve traffic and the experience of dining there overall.The launch of Queso didn't do as much for sales as expected, although the company changed the recipe after customers complained that it had an off-putting, grainy texture. Chipotle also faces more competition from smaller rivals that have used the Chipotle formula — serving food marketed as higher quality on an assembly-line format — for their own success, Cowen said.Already, as Nomura-Instinet analyst Mark Kalinowski wrote last month, two ""dream candidates"" for the CEO job at Chipotle had apparently been ruled out.Domino's Pizza (DPZ) CEO Patrick Doyle, who will step down from that position in June, had been seen as one potential candidate. But at the company's investor day in January, Doyle suggested the speculation about what he'll do post-Domino's wasn't close to accurate.""There are all sorts of conspiracy theories out there on what I'm going to do and every single one of them is incorrect,"" he said.Ron Shaich, the former CEO of Panera Bread who was also a rumored candidate, was perhaps bit more direct, tweeting: ""why in the world would I ever leave Panera to go try to solve Chipotle's problems?""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Options Play Helped Control Earnings Risk With Restaurant BrandsJack In The Box Sells Qdoba In Hot Year For Restaurant MergersDomino's Pizza Shows Improved Relative Strength; Still Shy Of Benchmark

2243,CMG,"Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) founder Steve Ells will step down as chief executive officer after struggling to pull the burrito chain out of a two-year slump.X Ells, who started the company in 1993, will hand over the reins once a new CEO is found, the Denver-based company said on Wednesday. He will continue as head of the board, taking the title of executive chairman.Chipotle has struggled to bounce back from an E. coli crisis in 2015 that sickened customers around the U.S. The company had begun to restore its reputation in the past year, but a norovirus incident in Virginia and a viral video of mice at a Dallas location sparked a fresh round of negative headlines.""It is clear that we need to move faster to make improvements,"" Ells said in a statement. ""Simply put, we need to execute better to ensure our future success.""Chipotle also suffered a data breach earlier this year, an incident that hurt its earnings and contributed to another stock slump. This year's hurricanes hammered Chipotle as well. It had 425 restaurants in the direct path of the storms.Bill Ackman, the billionaire hedge fund manager, is Chipotle's biggest investor. His firm, Pershing Square Capital Management, took a 10% stake in the burrito chain last year.

Grubhub (GRUB) shot up on a big deal with KFC and Taco Bell parent Yum Brands (YUM). Tesla sold off after in-line results and an out-of-this world publicity stunt.X With the major averages and many leading stocks tumbling, intensifying losses from the prior week's big losses, the stock market moved from uptrend under pressure to an outright correction. Chips, energy and China names were among the big losers, but the stock market retreat was broad and deep. Stocks did stage a nice rebound from the S&P 500's test of the 200-day moving average, but it takes more than one good day to snap a downtgrend. Facebook rivals Snap (SNAP) and Twitter (TWTR) had stellar results, while Nvidia delivered blowout earnings and bullish guidance. The 10-year Treasury yield hit a four-year high of 2.88%, unnerving stock markets, though it backed off.Graphics-chip maker Nvidia (NVDA) earnings swelled 80% to $1.78 a share, on sales of $2.91 billion, up 34%, in the quarter ended Jan. 28.

In the current setting, premarket gains tell an investor little about where the market may end the day.Leading benchmarks across Asia were mixed Wednesday, with Tokyo's Nikkei 225 rebounding 0.2% while China's markets continued to carve deep losses.

2252,CMG,"Many leading exchange traded fund providers have enjoyed solid inflow into their equity ETFs as the stock market continues its eight-year bull run.X That begs the question: Is the bull market getting a bit long in the tooth?No one can answer with certainty when the bull market will end. Yet, that may be just one of many reasons fixed-income funds have been taking over the spotlight in recent months. Still-low interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty are also oft cited by experts.Regardless of the reason, bond ETF inflow topped $100 billion early last month for the first time in a single calendar year.VanEck has witnessed firsthand the rush into bonds. The New York-based company, which entered the ETF market in 2006 with VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX), now offers more than 50 funds that together cover the stock, fixed income and commodity markets. Van Eck manages north of $41 billion in assets.Top Performing ETFs In 2017Nvidia, Top Tech Stocks Power Gains For Innovator IBD 50, SOXX3 Ways To Benefit As Economy Accelerates In The U.S. And AbroadNiche ETFs Are Hot, But Do They Have Longer-Lasting Potential?We got in touch with Ed Lopez, head of ETF product management at VanEck, for an update on topics including which strategies have outperformed, his thoughts on bitcoin and where the ETF provider expects growth in the coming year.""We've seen flows into our ETFs across a wide spectrum of asset classes,"" Lopez told IBD. ""Many associate us with our gold ETFs, such as VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ) which has seen over $1.0 billion of inflows year to date, but the more interesting stories are on the fixed-income side.""The full interview with Lopez follows:IBD: Which of VanEck's ETFs/strategies have attracted the most assets and inflow this year — and why?Lopez: Institutional and asset-allocator adoption of VanEck Vectors J.P. Morgan EM Local Currency Bond (EMLC) has helped it attract over $1.7 billion of net new assets year to date. Our municipal bond ETFs, with offerings across the credit and maturity spectrum, have gathered over $600 million of net flows this year. Much of that was driven by VanEck Vectors High-Yield Municipal Index (HYD), which has benefited from a combination of continuing investor demand for yield, relative value to taxable corporate high-yield bonds, and performance driven by supply and demand imbalance in the muni market.IBD: You just launched VanEck Vectors NDR CMG Long/Flat Allocation (LFEQ). How can it help investors manage risk in the U.S. stock market?Lopez: The U.S. equity market is in the midst of one of the longest equity bull runs ever, eight years and counting. As an investor you may feel apprehensive about equity investments, even if you know you need them for the long term. Or, alternatively, you may be one of the bulls with bountiful optimism for the near term. Still, many of us have experienced two major market declines of 40% or greater in just the last 17 years and those big nasty downturns can take years to recover from.We launched VanEck Vectors NDR CMG Long/Flat Allocation to help investors get the equity exposure they need while seeking to avoid major loses. Its underlying index follows a proprietary model developed by Ned Davis Research that measures the health of the market, industry by industry, and determines when, and by how much, to allocate between S&P 500 exposure and cash. It will step in and out of the market for you.IBD: We last spoke with you in January. What has changed at VanEck since then?Lopez: When we last spoke, we highlighted a potential rotation to equities. The ETF industry has seen strong flows and performance from the equity markets this year. In our own lineup, we've seen some of the strongest returns in international stocks. VanEck Vectors Morningstar International Moat (MOTI) for instance, has outperformed broad international indices, driven in large part by stock selection of Asia and eurozone companies. While equities have had a strong year, flows to taxable fixed income have continued to be robust. In March, we launched VanEck Vectors Green Bond (GRNB), the first U.S.-listed fixed-income ETF to provide targeted exposure to the fast-growing green-bonds market. (Green bonds' proceeds are used to fund environmentally friendly projects.) Green bond issuance this year totaled approximately $90 billion, as of Oct. 18, surpassing 2016 totals. To meet the climate objectives under the Paris Agreement, substantial infrastructure investment is needed and green bonds are expected to play a big role.IBD: VanEck Vectors Morningstar Wide Moat (MOAT) and VanEck Vectors Fallen Angel High Yield Bond (ANGL) marked their fifth anniversaries in April. Both funds are near all-time highs. Are there any particular market drivers for their respective YTD gains?Lopez: Generally, both funds benefit from the common drivers of quality and valuation. VanEck Vectors Morningstar Wide Moat, as a U.S. equity strategy, has been driven by strong contributions from the health care, consumer discretionary and information technology sectors. The real driver of ongoing long-term performance continues to be the stock selection process employed by Morningstar for the ETF's underlying index. Every quarter, selections are updated to ensure the index has exposure to companies with strong competitive advantages and that are trading at attractive relative prices, according to Morningstar's equity research team.VanEck Vectors Fallen Angel High Yield Bond has seen a large volume of fallen angel entrants since the 2014 oil price collapse and the ETF's exposure to the energy and basic industry sectors has increased. Many of these formerly investment-grade bonds entered the fund at meaningful discounts. The mostly credit-positive environment so far this year has supported high yield, in general, including recent oil price stabilization, and the fund's higher allocations to these sectors were the main drivers of outperformance vs. the broad high-yield bond market.IBD: VanEck applied for approval for VanEck Vectors Bitcoin Strategy ETF, but withdrew it after the SEC's feedback. What are your thoughts on bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) — is it the new gold?Lopez: Bitcoin certainly has similar characteristics to gold given its finite supply and independence from any one central bank, so I can understand the comparisons, at least from an investment standpoint. Still, gold is physical, it's a real asset. It is still the standard. Cryptocurrencies are digital assets. Like gold, bitcoin and other digital assets have uses other than just as currencies. Gold, for instance, can be used for jewelry or in technology applications. For digital assets the really interesting part of their future potential lies in the underlying technologies that drive them, their blockchains. Digital assets have potential to transform the global economy and how business is conducted, be it supply chain management or using smart contracts to make transactions like buying a house more efficient.IBD'S TAKE: On the lookout for ETF ideas that may be worth a closer look? Check out IBD's weekly ETF Leaders column for a featured fund and a list of highly rated ETFs.IBD: Smart beta continues to be popular among ETF providers. What other trends do you see occurring?Lopez: Smart beta probably still has some room to run, both in equity and fixed income. Also, investors are becoming more sophisticated about evaluating these funds through the lens of factors, or the underlying drivers of returns in a strategy, such as quality or momentum. The proliferation of smart beta strategies leads to a need for investor solutions to help wade through them all. So, you're seeing a number of fund registrations for fund-of-fund strategies that mix and match different ETFs to solve for some target allocation.IBD: What's next for VanEck?Lopez: VanEck continues to be focused on identifying new investment themes and solutions to help improve investor outcomes. As evidenced by our most recent launch of LFEQ, we have a keen interest in risk management and adaptive asset allocation.IBD: What types of ETFs should investors focus on in a rising interest rate environment?Lopez: If you're an income investor, you probably know that as rates rise, bond prices fall. The natural course of action is to lessen your interest rate exposure by targeting bonds at the short end of the maturity curve. Even so, those bonds may still be negatively impacted if short-term interest rates rise. Alternative options may include getting exposure to investment-grade floating rate notes, which have coupons that generally reset quarterly and that are based on the current level of interest rates. For the more risk-tolerant, business development companies are known for their high income potential generated by lending to, and investing in, private companies. The loans they make are positioned for rising rates with over 80%, on average, in floating-rate loans (vs. fixed-rate loans). Another solution may be to avoid the U.S. yield curve all together and consider non-U.S. dollar denominated bonds such as local currency emerging markets bonds.IBD: What is VanEck's outlook on the U.S. and global stock markets over the next three to six months?Lopez: VanEck believes the biggest opportunity in 2018 is emerging markets equities. Many investors are still underweight emerging markets equities given the long bull market in U.S. equities. Emerging markets equities have outperformed U.S. equities this year pretty substantially and we think this will continue in 2018. Asia is a big part of that story, not only due to the fact that countries like China, India, Korea and Taiwan make up such a large part of traditional emerging markets indices, but also that cash flow for Asian stocks is expected to grow 50% in 2018 and that hasn't yet been reflected in stock prices.IBD: What challenges do you face amid increased competition and price wars in the ETF industry?Lopez: We regularly review our product lineup to make sure our offerings are relevant for current markets and that we are competitively priced for the type of exposure provided. I think part of the challenge in today's crowded landscape is to stay in front of investors with solution-oriented ideas.

2253,CMG,"Upscale furniture retailer RH (RH) (also known as Restoration Hardware) fell short of top-line forecasts, restaurant-arcade chain Dave & Buster's (PLAY) was mixed and announced new, smaller-format stores, while health savings firm HealthEquity (HQY) beat estimates.X Estimates: Third-quarter earnings per share to more than quintuple to $1.04. Sales to increase 9% to $599 million, per Zacks Investment Research forecasts.Results: EPS of $1.04 on revenue of $592.5 million. Comparable brand revenues increased 6%.Outlook: Q4 revenue of  $655 million-$680 million and fiscal 2018 revenue of $2.58 billion-$2.62 billion.

Shares closed up 1.45% at 103.87 on the stock market today. The stock has more than doubled in price since its last earnings report in early September. Williams-Sonoma (WSM) dipped 0.8%.RH is something of a retail anomaly, given that it has doubled down on its devotion to enormous brick-and-mortar galleries and thick print catalogs. Its current guidance includes Q3 EPS of $1.02-$1.04, up from prior guidance of 68-80 cents, on revenue of $592.5 million, up from a range of $575 million-$590 million.Estimates: Q3 EPS to slide 8% to 23 cents, while revenue grows 11% to $255 million.Results: EPS of 29 cents on revenue of $250 million, though natural disasters impacted revenue by $2 million. Comparable store sales decreased 1.3%.Outlook: Full-year revenue is now seen at $1.148 billion-$1.155 billion, down from a prior view of $1.16 billion-$1.17 billion and full-year comps are seen flat to up 0.75% vs. a previous view for 1%-2% growth.

2255,CMG,"The stock market's slide on Wednesday was blamed in part on the House of Representatives' continued flirtation with capping 401(k) pretax contributions to pay for tax cuts, despite President Trump's vow on Monday that no such change would take place.X""It's probably one part, maybe a small part, of the broader picture,"" said Sameer Samana, global quantitative strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute. ""Today's sell-off was probably somewhat related to the odds of tax policy changes, with yesterday (politicians raising) questions about how to pay for it, whether by capping deductions to 401(k)s or the state and local tax deductions. That's causing investors to be concerned that tax reform may not get passed if (the House) can't find sources of funding for changes.""The sell-off on the stock market today was also attributed to investor concerns about an apparent erosion in willingness among Republicans in the Senate and House to work with Trump, Samana said. ""Those doubts about Republican unity could also lead to a lower probability of tax changes,"" he said.In addition, market weakness was associated with investor concerns about possible corporate earnings disappointments. Overnight reports from Chipotle (CMG) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) were letdowns.Chipotle shares plunged 15% after it reported earnings ravaged by hurricanes, a data hack and high avocado prices.And Advanced Micro dropped 13% after good earnings nevertheless fell short of many investors' expectations.With valuations high for stocks in general, amid some disappointments, many investors on Wednesday may have decided it was time to take profits, Samana said.A report in ZeroHedge.com blamed the sell-off on continued toying with the idea of a 401(k) pretax contribution cap. ZeroHedge cited comments by House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas,  at a gathering of reporters, who declined to rule out lowering the contribution cap when asked if Trump's opposition had killed that idea for raising federal tax revenues.Shortly after midday Wednesday, the broad stock market was down 0.72% in the form of the S&P 500 index.RELATED:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

2257,CMG,"If you have a big winner in hand, the key question is this: How long should I hold the stock? And could this big winner become an exceptional moneymaker?There's no easy answer.XNumerous factors matter. One, it depends a lot on what point you began to invest in the market cycle. A bull market tends to last two to four years. The big money tends to be made in the first year or two.In most cases, profits should be taken when a stock rises 20% to 25% past a proper buy point. Then there are times to hold out longer, like when a stock jumps more than 20% in three weeks or less. These fast movers should be held for at least eight weeks. After those eight weeks pass, the next step is to study the stock's chart and see if it is holding up well. If so, and the market is rising, chances are good the uptrend will continue and new breakouts will send shares even higher.For true market leaders, the typical time from breakout to peak ranges from 12 to 18 months.But when you truly have something special in your hands, you have to give it even more room to bloom.""If you really know and understand a company thoroughly and its products well, you'll have the crucial additional confidence required to sit tight through several inevitable but normal corrections,"" wrote IBD Chairman William O'Neil in ""How To Make Money In Stocks.""If you like reading investment classics such as O'Neil's book, then you've probably also read the 1923 classic ""Reminiscences of a Stock Operator"" by Edwin Lefevre, who profiles the extraordinary trader of the early 20th century, Jesse Livermore. Lefevre quotes Livermore as saying, ""After spending many years in Wall Street and after making and losing millions of dollars I want to tell you this: It never was my thinking that the made the big money for me. It always was my sitting. Got that? My sitting tight!""""I have repeated the mistake of grabbing at small profits and selling at a targeted round number over and over in my speculative career,"" wrote Victor Niederhoffer, a futures expert and former currencies trader for the former hedge fund titan George Soros, in the 1997 autobiography ""The Education of a Speculator.""""I believe many others make this same error. The reason: Many players set their sights at certain reasonable targets. Fast-moving operators, aware of these targets, come in just ahead, ready to take the other side, knowing that there will be considerable pressure to offset at prices not much worse than current. This pressure usually drives the price away from the target. But if the price can overcome these operators and reach the target, something big is about to happen,"" Niederhoffer added.Staying with a stock for some time will allow gains to compound, especially if you can locate follow-on entry points and add shares when it breaks out anew.In a general bull market, winners may be held for years. One of O'Neil's huge winners, Pic ""N' Save, was held for more than six years.Microsoft (MSFT) was a gigantic winner from the late 1980s through the late 1990s. With its dominant position in operating systems and productivity software, its stock skyrocketed from a split-adjusted breakout near 90 cents in September 1989 to its high of 119.94 in December 1999.Cisco Systems (CSCO) soared 75,000% from an initial buy point in late 1990 before finally topping in March 2000. The networking titan had huge earnings and sales gains as well as juicy profit margins and a high return on equity.Both Microsoft and Cisco Systems were among the best at what they did. Both companies also benefited greatly from the tech and internet boom.A few names currently in the IBD 50 have done extremely well lately, including social media network Weibo (WB), which has risen more than 430% since breaking out of a deep first-stage cup with handle at 19.20 in the week ended April 8, 2016; chip technology giant Nvidia (NVDA), which has vaulted more than 430% since clearing a cup with handle at 33.16 in the week ended March 18, 2016; and upstart data networking gear firm Arista Networks (ANET), up more than 160% from a 72.01 buy point in an eight-week cup with handle that sits inside a larger, deeper base.All three have demonstrated outstanding earnings growth, sales growth, and profit margins. Arista's return on equity, part of the measure for IBD's SMR Rating as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, was 33.3%, 25.9% and 25.5% in the past three fiscal years.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) was a big market winner after the stock market bottomed out in March 2009. After the 2007 to 2008 bear market, the stock bottomed before the market did in March 2009. The stock later broke out to 52-week highs in January 2010 and ran up 348% before topping in April 2012. It built a series of bases along the way.The firm delivered quarter after quarter of double-digit earnings and sales gains, thanks to its simple menu of fresh, higher-quality ingredients.When did the stock show a major sell signal?In late July 2015, Chipotle broke out of a long saucerlike base. It had one major flaw: Most of it formed beneath the 10-week moving average. Gains were scrawny after Chipotle moved past a 728.07 entry, exceeding no more than 4%.Starting with the week ended Oct. 16, 2015, the restaurant play slumped six weeks in a row, falling in heavy volume and crashing through its 10-week and 40-week moving averages — two critical sell signals. A third sell signal? It easily fell 8% below the latest buy point of 728.07.Those who sold on any of those signals would have saved a lot of money; Chipotle went on to battle its worst PR crisis as customers across the country got sickened by tainted ingredients throughout the second half of the year.

2259,CMG,"Growth stocks continued to cool off in afternoon trading Wednesday as the major indexes were blanketed by sellers. Tesla (TSLA), meanwhile, continued to slump further below its 50-day moving average and may be gearing toward a test of institutional support at the longer-term 200-day moving average.XTesla dropped more than 3% to 326.41 as volume was on pace to more than double its 50-day average turnover of 5.2 million shares.The stock had cleared a cup with handle at 370.10 in September but did not get far. Earlier this week, the electric vehicle leader triggered the 7%-loss-cutting sell rule, known in IBD rules as the golden rule of investing.At 2:45 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite continued to bounce a bit off intraday lows but still was down 0.7%, on course for its biggest decline since Sept. 25.The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 were off nearly 0.6%. Volume was still running sharply higher vs. the same time Tuesday on both main exchanges, pointing to a possible new distribution day, or a session of intense professional selling.Read IBD's The Big Picture column to keep track of distribution days and the possibility of significant market corrections that may emerge.Small caps fell in lock step with their large-cap brethren. The S&P SmallCap 600 lost nearly 0.8%. The Dow transports slumped nearly 1.5%.Going back to Tesla, the large-cap automaker has made a huge run since its initial breakout near 40 to new highs back in April 2013. However, the latest base showed at least one flaw. As seen in a daily chart, the stock lacked smooth, quiet price action.Volume was mostly quiet on the down days in price, and that's good. But Tesla's cup with handle also lacked a sense of symmetry. It took just a little more than two weeks to form the left side of an 11-week base.A good cup with handle will feature calmer action on a day-to-day and week-to-week basis, as well as symmetry. Still, chances remain high that the stock will form a new base following the failed breakout.The company shows outstanding top-line growth; due in part to strong sales of its Model S and X brands, revenue is seen rising 28% to $2.95 billion in the third quarter. As production of the new Model 3 sedan ramps up, Wall Street's Tesla's top line to grow even faster in Q4, up 54% to $3.51 billion. However, Wall Street sees the Palo Alto, Calif., firm still losing $6.63 a share in 2017.Tesla has a $54 billion market value, 167 million shares outstanding and a float of 127 million.Chinese ADRs slumped after posting big gains throughout the year.Social media network Weibo (WB) dropped more than 4% to 91.38, getting rejected during an early rebound back to its 50-day moving average. Volume is running more than twice usual levels.Shares look poised to build a new base as Weibo now stands 15% off a 52-week high of 108.30.Chinese school operator New Oriental Education (EDU) cut some losses, but still fell more than 3% to 88.99. The consumer spending play is testing support at the 50-day line following a deceleration in quarterly profit growth. Earnings for the fiscal second quarter ended in August rose 13%, down from gains of 41% in the prior two quarters.Other leading stocks getting hard in heavy turnover in the stock market today included Abiomed (ABMD) (down nearly 5%), Nvidia (NVDA) (down 2.5%) and IBD 50 and Big Cap 20 name Lam Research (LRCX). Lam continues to hold nicely above its rising 50-day moving average, though.Abiomed, marketer of an innovative heart pump, dropped more than 3% to 171.16 but was down as much as 6.8% intraday. Earnings in the September-ended fiscal second quarter are expected to vault 90% to 38 cents a share on a 27% increase in sales to $131.1 million.The mid-cap medical play broke out of a long cup with handle at 126.49 on April 24 and has gained as much as 40%.IBD's TAKE: Even when the market is in a confirmed uptrend, an excellent selling strategy for growth investors is to take numerous profits when a stock is up 20% to 25% from a proper buy point. In some cases, one can hold out for a 30% to 40% gain before raising some cash.

2260,CMG,"The S&P 500 index and other major averages hit fresh all-time highs last week. But Apple (AAPL), Alibaba (BABA) and recent FANG breakouts Facebook (FB) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are among the many stocks that continue to struggle to make much headway past buy points.XLike beached whales, some big-name stocks are making it to land, but then not going much of anywhere. Such stocks struggle to get off the beach, in danger of going underwater depending on the shifting market tides.That raises risks for investors, who have become complacent because they haven't suffered serious  negative consequences from sticking with the likes of Apple, Nvidia (NVDA) and other big names that suffered ugly post-breakout reversals.A lot of this reflects the general market. The S&P 500 index, like the other averages, has been grinding higher, with baby-step gains offset by shallow pullbacks. Individual names tend to follow the market, so breakouts occur during short-term upswings, leaving them vulnerable to the broader averages backing off for a time.S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures rose a fraction vs. fair value early Monday morning. So did Dow futures.Alphabet limped above a 1,006.29 flat-base buy point on Oct. 13 in below-average volume. Facebook topped a 175.59 flat-base entry last Tuesday. But they didn't really go anywhere. Thursday's modest Nasdaq declines help push both back underwater. Alphabet and Facebook both edged higher Friday but didn't re-enter buy zones.Alibaba (BABA) has been playing this game for weeks. The Chinese e-commerce giant on Sept. 13 cleared a 177.10 buy point from a rare ascending base, the stock has been above and below the entry. Alibaba dipped 0.3% on Friday to 177.32.Apple broke above a 156.75 flat-base buy point on Aug. 2, following a solid earnings report. Apple spent several weeks generally above level, but pulled back in September amid concerns about iPhone 8 demand and iPhone X production woes. The stock didn't quite fall enough to make the 156.75 entry invalid, though a high-volume tumble through its 50-day line didn't help.However, Apple found support and is now working on a new flat base with 165.04 entry. Apple did fall back below its 50-day on Thursday, closing at 156.25 on Friday.When one of these beached-whale breakouts just hovers by a buy point, you have very little cushion. You're at high risk of falling underwater due to modest moves stemming from the market, industry or company-specific reasons.Electronic Arts (EA) hung around a late July buy point for months. Then last week EA delayed a much-anticipated ""Star Wars"" video game. Shares slid 4.2%, hitting a three-month low. EA hasn't invalidated its old entry and it's in a new flat base, but it's frustrating to be sitting on little-or-no gain for months, then see your stock go into the red.But investors have been complacent about lackluster breakouts. The lack of significant market corrections has helped stocks quickly recover.Even with its significant sell-off, if you had bought Apple right at the old buy point, you're down less than 1%.In other cases, a stock shows ugly action but then rebounds for tidy gains. Nvidia is a great example.Nvidia broke out in mid-September and in two days had risen as much as 9.5% from the 174.66 buy point. But the stock then quickly reversed and erased all its gains and then some. Nvidia just avoided a 10% round trip that is an automatic sell signal. Investors certainly would have been justified at getting out of their position.But it turns out that Nvidia wasn't a beached whale but a land shark. Shares of the graphics and A.I. chipmaker turned around and rallied strongly. Nvidia closed Friday at 196.90, up nearly 13% from the buy point.For blasé investors in 2017, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is a cautionary tale. The burrito chain, back when it was still delivering double-digit same-store growth, broke out in January 2015. Shares hung around for a few weeks near the buy point, but then sold off over several months, correcting nearly 15%. But Chipotle soon rebounded and cleared a new base in July 2015. Shares traded above or below that entry point until October, when it began to plunge over widespread food-borne illness outbreaks. But Chipotle kept falling.Chipotle hit a multiyear low just last month and is currently more than 50% below its old high.RELATED:The Big Picture: Stocks Ride Tax-Cut Hopes; These 2 Groups OutperformYour Stock Goes Nowhere After A Breakout: How Long Should You Wait?Apple Might Have Just 2 Million iPhone X Units At LaunchHolding Alibaba Was Easy; Buying It Was TrickyHow Does Facebook Compare To Amazon, Netflix And Google?FANG Stocks News & Quotes: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google

2261,CMG,"Facebook (FB) wants to be a bigger player in the restaurant game.The social network has announced a new feature that will let users buy meals on its website through third-party delivery services like DoorDash or directly from a group of restaurants such as Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and Five Guys.Facebook has been working on the new product for a year, and carried out tests with restaurants including Papa John's (PZZA). It's part of tech company efforts to boost their presence in the restaurant industry.Facebook is taking a cue from Amazon.com (AMZN), which recently announced a partnership with Olo, a provider of order and pay technology to thousands of U.S. locations. Olo will also be part of the new Facebook feature.While Amazon might not make money on food orders, its delivery service is seen as a way to gather valuable customer data and keep in constant contact with consumers. All types of restaurants operate Facebook pages and the company has seen a rise in users searching out food on its site.Facebook said it has no plans to hire drivers and actually deliver food, but it hopes the new ordering feature will keep users on its site longer, instead of logging off to place orders elsewhere.""We're just trying to make it easier for people,"" said Alex Himel, a Facebook vice president. He referred to the process of finding a restaurant on the site, then logging onto a third-party site or actually calling the restaurant a ""pain point.""

2262,CMG,"Jana Partners dumped its stake in Snapchat-parent Snap (SNAP) in the second quarter, according to a regulatory filing disclosed Monday, making it the latest fund to do so as the company struggles to compete with the likes of Facebook (FB).XDan Loeb's Third Point Capital also offloaded its shares in Snap in the second quarter, according to a Friday disclosure.Meanwhile, Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital slashed its holdings in Mondelez International (MDLZ) by 27% to roughly 14.5 million shares. The fund's holdings in Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) remained steady at around 2.9 million shares.The Mexican fast-casual chain has been trying for much of the past two years to repair its image following food-safety concerns.Monday is the deadline for big investors to disclose their quarterly holdings. Look for disclosures from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB), George Soros' Soros Fund Management and others later today.Snap tumbled to a record low of 11.28 in morning trade, but rebounded to trade up 6% at 12.54 near midday in the stock market today. Snap crashed 14% on Friday following across-the-board weak Q2 results.Chipotle fell 0.9%, near four-year lows and well below where Pershing Square acquired its stake. Mondelez rose 0.7%.

2263,CMG,"Bill Ackman is done with Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX), still shorting Herbalife (HLF) and tweeting about Chipotle (CMG). Now the billionaire hedge funder is turning his blue-eyed gaze toward payroll firm Automatic Data Processing (ADP).XAckman's Pershing Square Capital is seeking control of five of ADP's 10 board seats, said ADP in a Friday statement.ADP said Pershing first reached out on Tuesday, and Ackman — who beneficially owns 8% of the payroll processor — asked the company to extend its Aug. 10 board nomination deadline by 30 to 45 days to nominate five directors, including himself, to ADP's board. Ackman also told ADP that CEO Carlos Rodriguez ""should be replaced.""But ADP is pushing back, touting its total shareholder return of 202% since Rodriguez took the helm and contrasting it to Pershing's return of 29%.""ADP is open to constructive input from our shareholders, and our Board respects the right of shareholders to nominate directors,"" said the company. ""However, ADP has a clearly defined Board nomination process, and the 2017 deadline for director nominations has been public for nearly a year. The Board has unanimously determined that it is not in the best interests of ADP or its other shareholders to accede to Pershing Square's last-minute request for an extension.""The current board has ""an effective balance of leadership continuity and fresh perspectives"" that will help ADP to further its goals, said the statement.ADP shares rose about 2% initially but closed down 0.3% to 111.39 in the stock market today.

He took his bet on drugmaker Valeant all the way to the bottom, more or less, holding on to Pershing Square's stake until March of this year, despite a 2015 price-spiking scandal that drove off other hedge funds. Pershing Square was reportedly offered 11.10 to 11.40 each for shares that, at their late 2015 high, traded at 263.81.He also has a billion-dollar bet against multilevel marketing firm Herbalife, alleging that the nutrition supplement seller is a pyramid scheme. The Federal Trade Commission leveled a complaint against Herbalife last July that resulted in the company agreeing to fully restructure its U.S. business and pay consumers $200 million over charges that Herbalife deceived people into believing they could get rich quick by becoming distributors of its products.The ensuing FTC regulations have weighed on Herbalife, but shares are up over 35% so far this calendar year.A few weeks ago, Ackman joined Twitter.

2264,CMG,"Yum Brands (YUM) on Thursday reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that topped forecasts early Thursday.XEstimates: Wall Street expects the company, which owns Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC, to report earnings per share of 61 cents, down 19%, with revenue dropping by more than half to $1.412 billion. Same-store sales are seen up 2.2%.The EPS and revenue estimates reflect the spinoff of its China business, now called Yum China (YUMC), late last year.Results: Yum earned 68 cents a share. Revenue was $1.45 billion. Same-store sales rose 2% worldwide. Pizza Hut's global same-store sales fell 1% in Q2 vs. Taco Bell's 4% gain and KFC's 3% advance.Stock: Shares sank 2.4% to 74.78 on the stock market today. Yum hit a record high on Wednesday.Before the results, Nomura-Instinet analyst Mark Kalinowski raised his full-year EPS forecast on the company. Taco Bell, he said, continued to stand out by virtue of ""not being a burger brand,"" and efforts to keep its menu fresh.Among those efforts? Naked Chicken Chips — that is, seasoned white-meat chicken, in chip form, with nacho cheese sauce. Kalinowski said the promotional push for those chips during the quarter appeared to pay off.Meanwhile, he said, results out of Pizza Hut will likely be uninspiring through the rest of the year, as rivals Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Papa John's (PZZA) pull ahead of the industry with delivery technology.But he appreciated some of the company's recent efforts: Pizza Hut last month said it had developed a ""proprietary delivery network algorithm"" that can predict delivery times while factoring in weather, traffic, construction and other things that might affect a pizza's journey to a customer's doorstep. Kalinowski also said he expected Pizza Hut to launch a loyalty program sometime this year.Papa John's (PZZA) last month announced that customers could order food via Facebook (FB). Papa John's shares jumped Tuesday after the company a day earlier announced a $500 million hike in its buyback plan and said it would raise its leverage ratio, even though it reported second-quarter North American same-store sales that missed expectations.RELATED:McDonald's Touts Digital Progress; Domino's Falls HardBurger King Parent Restaurant Brands Earnings Top, Sales MissChipotle, Wynn Resorts, U.S. Steel, Hawaiian Earnings Top

2273,CMG,"Safety: The popular Mexican restaurant chain is taking another huge hit after its food safety problem re-emerged. That's bad for Chipotle (CMG) and its investors, but good for consumers. The free market, left on its down, is a fierce protector of consumer interests.In late 2015, hundreds of people reported getting sick from e-coli, salmonella, and norovirus after eating at Chipotles in California, Washington, Minnesota and Massachusetts.Between October 2015 and the end of that year, sales plunged and the company's stock dropped 43%. The company closed all its stores for a day in early 2016 to conduct food-safety training. A month later it had to temporarily close a Massachusetts outlet after four employees got sick. Sales continued to drop in 2016 and sales were down 13% for the year compared with 2015.After spending massively on marketing and promotions and promising that it had its food safety problem under control, consumers and investors started coming back.But last week 100 people reported getting sick after eating at a Chipotle in a northern Virginia suburb, which turned out to be from a norovirus. And in Dallas, customers reported that mice were falling from the ceiling, and videos of several of them crawling around the store instantly went viral. The restaurant blamed a ""small structural gap in the building"" for the invasion.Chipotle's stock price tumbled more than 7% on Friday to a four-year low. It's now 53% below its 2015 peak.To some, this is karmic payback for the restaurant chain's arrogant ""food with integrity"" campaign — in which it bragged about how its produce and meat were locally grown, sustainable, organic, non-GMO, and whatever other politically correct buzzwords it could cram onto its website.But Chipotle knew all along that while portraying itself as a more wholesome alternative — and charging a premium for it — the restaurant chain was actually putting its customers at increased risk. In a 2014 SEC filing, it admitted that the chain's food-sourcing requirements ""present additional risk of food-borne illnesses given the greater number of suppliers involved in such a system and the difficulty of imposing our quality assurance programs on all such suppliers.""There's a common assumption that only the government can impose safety requirements and that the market, left on its own, will be bad for consumers. Chipotle shows that this assumption is false. Instead, it shows how a competitive market keeps customers safe, and does so far more efficiently and effectively than an army of government regulators could.The marketplace's punishment for Chipotle's misdeeds was swift and severe. It had to go to great lengths and spend a fortune to rebuild trust with its customers. It may have to do so again.If it can't, other restaurants will quickly take Chipotle's place. Customers will be safer, and everyone involved in that business will get a fresh reminder that food safety is paramount to stay in business. And all without any government meddling at all.

2275,CMG,"If any publicly traded restaurant chain other than Shake Shack (SHAK) had seen a key sales metric tumble 8% in a single month, as it did in March, it would likely spark an investor panic.But there's little about Shake Shack that fits into the typical cookie-cutter, fast-casual restaurant chain mold. While Shake Shack's stock has come down from its post-initial public offering moonshot two years ago — as Wall Street debates whether its early formula for success can be repeated again and again — investors seem to be concluding that its outsized per-restaurant profits are too tasty to lose faith.Even after that stumble in same-store sales, which measure year-ago revenue from outlets that have been open at least two years, shares of the New York-based chain that sprang from famed restaurateur Danny Meyer's Union Square Hospitality Group are up slightly on the year. They're also near the top of a seven-month consolidation zone.""While we expect the company to produce current- and long-term positive same-store sales, we at the same time expect a certain level of volatility for these results. However, at the end of the day absolute dollar profits are increasing at a double-digit pace,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Nicole Regan wrote in a recent note to clients.Although a multitude of factors contributed to its March sales slump, the simplest explanation is that, despite all the hype surrounding its increasingly well-known brand, Shake Shack is still a relatively small corporation. It has only 72 company-owned outlets and less than $300 million in annual revenue.Still, Shake Shack restaurants create so much buzz when they open that sales tend to fall off by roughly 5% in the second year, notes Regan. For that reason, the company only adds restaurants to the comparable same-store base after 24 months, while many others add to their base after 16 to 18 months.Shake Shack reported 32 outlets for the first quarter of 2015, and so it has more than doubled its store count in the last two years. It's one reason the same-store-sales metric so beloved by Wall Street can obscure the important drivers that set Shake Shack apart, particularly at this stage of its growth.Analysts and management think investors should focus on a number of other metrics. For one, the average check of about $16 at Shake Shack is about 50% larger than it is with other chains, according to Regan. Meanwhile, the company's restaurant unit growth rate is about triple that of its peer group.""Shake Shack's new units are profitable within a quarter of opening, in contrast to most growth peers,"" wrote Wedbush analysts Nick Setyan and Colin Radke in a May 18 report.""This is a company with 72 company-owned restaurants, and we've barely scratched the surface on the 450 that's highly achievable for us,"" Shake Shack Chief Executive Randy Garutti said on a May 7 earnings call, according to transcripts.""So that is our focus,"" Garutti said. ""When you look at what — let's just take this quarter. We added $24 million to sales vs. last year (up 42%). Yes, that was offset by a negative comp.""Shake Shack sprung from a single hot-dog cart and later a kiosk-style restaurant that opened at Manhattan's Madison Square Park in 2004. In addition to its 72 company-operated restaurants, there are another 58 franchises, mostly in international locations, that are operated by partners. These partners pay license fees to Shake Shack that generated $2.6 million in revenue in the first quarter, up 28.9% from a year ago.In the first quarter, Shake Shack opened seven company-operated restaurants and seven international licensed Shacks, including two in London and five in the Middle East. For the year, management said it expects to open 23 or 24 company-operated units, up from 22 or 23. They're expected to have average sales volumes of $3.3 million, up from prior guidance of $3.2 million.Wedbush turned bullish on Shake Shack last month, upgrading the stock to outperform from neutral on May 18, while hiking its price target to 43 from 33. Setyan told Investor's Business Daily that expectations and valuation ""have come down to earth.""IBD'S TAKE: McDonald's has outperformed every other Dow Jones industrial average stock this year except Apple. But it's nowhere near the top performer in the IBD Retail-Restaurants industry group. Check out the leaders based on stock price, earnings, sales and margins at IBD Stock Checkup""This is not a comp (comparable-store sales) story. It's a unit growth story,"" Setyan said. Even as same-store-sales growth took a hit, the company has been exceeding expectations for sales volumes at new stores, and that bodes well for Shake Shack being able to meet, if not exceed, its long-term expansion goals. Investors also have, by now, ""fully digested"" the reality that labor costs will be a headwind for margins as states raise their minimum wage as high as $15 an hour.Regan explains that the economics of Shake Shack restaurants ""remain best-in-class."" Only McDonald's (MCD) and Chipotle (CMG) are even close to the same ballpark of the $3.3 million average revenue per new restaurant expected by Shake Shack, she notes. Shake Shack, she says, has a stellar return on an investment of 30%-plus, meaning it takes just three years to offset the average $2 million development cost.""Unit-level economics are so strong,"" Regan told IBD, that she expects the number of Shake Shack restaurants will double over the coming five years. Piper Jaffray initiated coverage on Shake Shack with an overweight rating and 44 target on May 24.Shake Shack doesn't just want its restaurants to stand apart from the competition, it wants pretty much each Shack to have its own identity, so that there's a sense of community ownership. Much of that is done through its design efforts.""There is nobody in our space who is willing or able to design restaurants that look like that and charge $5 for a burger,"" Garutti said at a June 15 William Blair growth stock conference, while walking investors through about 20 slides showing newer, distinctive looking Shake Shacks. ""We have a design aesthetic, a goal to get better and do cooler, more experiential retail than we've ever done.""Among the 2017 crop of restaurants is one in Lexington, Ky., which features a salted caramel shake with Maker's Mark bourbon, which is distilled in the state. That exemplifies the company's effort to collaborate with artisanal producers or famous local chefs and cultivate what Garutti refers to as Shake Shack's ""halo effect"" that comes from its fine-dining lineage.Setyan credits Shake Shack management for the ""marketing genius of turning this into a lifestyle brand.""""They've done a very good job of positioning the brand as a destination"" for a younger, higher-income demographic, he said. Customers can easily justify spending $15 per check because they're comparing Shake Shack to an upscale burger dining experience that costs $20-$35, rather than to cheaper quick-service competitors such as McDonald's.While unit growth may be the biggest driver of profits going forward, Shake Shack also is taking steps to keep same-unit sales moving in the right direction. Digital ordering accounted for 3% of sales last quarter as the company launched an app for the Apple iPhone, but it's still working on its Android version.RELATED:Want Fries With That Breakout?

2281,CMG,"XWall Street on Wednesday managed to safely digest Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) after the company's earnings report late Tuesday.Chipotle reported better-than-expected earnings and sales. But the fast-casual chain's payment-processing network got hacked. Then again, it's testing two new desserts this month.So, as the once-trendy eatery tries to regain customers who might have fled following a well-publicized foodborne illness scare in 2015, should you, perhaps, consider buying Chipotle again?Shares sank through 2016 but have trended up this year, breaking out of a base above the 200-day moving average in late March. Shares rose 2.4% to 482.99 in the stock market today, hitting a 13-month high of 497.48 intraday.That comes as several other restaurant stocks have been breaking out of consolidations, including burger chains McDonald's (MCD), Wendy's (WEN) and, briefly, Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR).CEO Steve Ells said in Chipotle's earnings release that ""2017 is off to a strong start."" And during the company's earnings call he attributed that strength to simpler operations, staff-training efforts, more-aggressive marketing, improvements in digital ordering, and ""a continued focus on serving safe, wholesome and delicious food.""Here's a look at analysts who strongly agree with that sentiment, cautiously agree or are still holding out.Piper Jaffray analyst Nicole Miller Regan has said Chipotle's recovery is a matter of "" 'when,' not 'if,' "" — a position she repeated in a research note following the company's report, adding that the company's marketing efforts should help.But she also cautioned investors to ""remain patient"" about owning its shares, and to look for whether the company could now put together a string of quarterly improvements. She kept her ""overweight"" rating on the stock but upped her price target from $483 to $530.SunTrust Robinson analyst Jake Bartlett offered a similar sentiment, calling the turnaround ""as real as it gets."" He said the chain's new TV advertising effort, along with the increasing digital orders and an expansion in delivery tests, could also benefit the company.Bartlett also raised his price target to $550 from $500. He has a buy rating on Chipotle and said he believes that any impact from the data breach would be ""insignificant."" Management said an investigation was focusing on ""current transactions in our restaurants that occurred from March 24, 2017, through April 18, 2017.""Bartlett and other analysts noted that Wendy's suffered a credit card breach last year that did minimal financial damage. But RBC analyst David Palmer, in a research note, said the hack might make consumers more wary about placing digital orders.Palmer also said that it was unclear, based on management's comments during the earnings call, how much advertising and digital efforts would help the company. He said further that while margin oversight got better, labor and food costs could creep higher in the quarters to come. He downgraded Chipotle to sector perform from outperform.During the call, management said those costs rose after bringing the preparation of items like lettuce and bell peppers back into restaurants. Incentive-based bonuses for managers who made customer experience better, as well as inflation, could offset sales increases and the company's other efforts to keep labor costs in check, management added. And while food costs as a percentage of sales improved during the quarter, an avocado shortage won't help.BTIG analyst Peter Saleh, who stuck with his neutral rating on Chipotle, said weak sales on the West Coast and in the Northeast were signs that ""recovery remains anemic.""Analysts were also concerned about what appeared to be weaker two-year sales trends. Cowen's Andrew Charles also said its analysis ""suggests underlying sales are challenged so far in April despite an effective 1% price increase.""""We remain cautious on the cadence of the sales turnaround but acknowledge with cost savings experienced in 1Q, CMG could be setting up to beat on margins, leading us to reiterate our Market Perform rating,"" he continued.Some analysts were also cautious on the company's valuation compared to results.""While we expect positive (same-store sales) to continue over the next few quarters given easy laps, we believe the current valuation reflects a high degree of optimism and leaves little room for error,"" wrote Canaccord Genuity analyst Lynne Collier, who nonetheless raised her price target on the stock to $440 to $375.Others say that skepticism is unwarranted.""At base, we believe the bears are wrong about the explanation for the slow pace of CMG's recovery, which is being incorrectly attributed to increased competition,"" Buckingham Research analyst John Zolidis said. ""Our alternate narrative is that CMG's food safety incident occurred in a world of social media which massively amplified the effect. This has elongated the impact and delayed the recovery.""Analyst sentiment remains much more positive on McDonald's, which was lavished with price hikes after its first-quarter results topped analyst estimates. McDonald's fell 0.6% to 140.84 Wednesday, snapping a seven-day win streak. McDonald's soared 5.6% on Tuesday to a record high on its earnings.But Wall Street isn't as thrilled with Restaurant Brands International, whose shares sank 3.1% to 56.66 after the Burger King and Tim Hortons parent beat on the top and bottom lines but reported a surprise dip in same-store sales. Restaurant Brands fell back below a 58.08 buy point after edging past it on Tuesday. But the stock rebounded from an intraday of 54, rallying back above its 50-day line.Wendy's rose 0.1% to 14.78, still in range from a 14.57 buy point cleared Monday.As for Chipotle's desserts, one of the items being tested is bunuelos — fried tortilla strips with honey, cinnamon and sugar, management said. The dish will be served with an apple caramel butter dipping sauce.RELATED:Is It Time To Talk To Your Barista?

Those restaurants will have digital ordering kiosks and table service.But the restaurant and retail sectors are trying to meet more sophisticated consumer tastes and adapt to the mobile devices that have reshaped the way people shop and get around.IBD'S TAKE: Despite McDonald's efforts at reform, many people still believe they're serving straight-up garbage. However, the company has remained in good standing among teenagers, according to a recent Piper Jaffray survey. For more about what companies resonate with teenagers, read this story.CEO Steve Easterbrook said the company had a detailed training plan for the shift to that new format, and said ""I think the excitement exceeds the nervousness by quite some way.""As more people turn to the internet for takeout, McDonald's said it would launch a mobile order and pay platform in thousands of restaurants by the end of this year. And by the middle of next year, the company will also serve fresh-beef, cooked-when-ordered Quarter Pounders in most of its restaurants, an attempt to keep up with the growing popularity of fresher ingredients.Along those lines, McDonald's on Tuesday said it would also bring Signature Crafted Sandwiches to U.S. restaurants next week.McDonald's noted that in early trials of fresh Quarter Pounders, drive-thru service slowed slightly. But Easterbrook said the company had found ways around that issue, along with ways to simplify the handling, packaging and storing of the food. He said he anticipates minimal cost increases from the rollout.""We have worked through a lot of the kinks in this,"" Easterbrook said.Management credited the Q1 U.S. sales boost to expanded All-Day Breakfast offerings as well as Big Mac and beverage promotions, and attributed international strength to the start of All-Day Breakfast in Canada.""Our efforts to build a better McDonald's are yielding meaningful results with continued positive momentum and a strong start to 2017 that includes positive comparable sales across all segments, higher global guest counts and enhanced profitability,"" said Easterbrook in a statement earlier.The results arrive as the restaurant industry's sales have suffered from discount battles, harsh or erratic weather, and cheaper groceries, which have given diners more of a reason to eat in.But McDonald's nationwide $1 coffee promotion and new Big Mac sizes — the Grand Mac and the Mac Jr. — cushioned results during Q1. And the management during the call said the price gap between food at home and food away from home was narrowing.Year-over-year comparisons for the fast-food giant could also become more favorable in the second half, analysts say, after the breakfast expansion's boost leveled off in late 2016. McDonald's $1 soda promotion and a $2 promotion for some McCafe drinks could also help in the current quarter.""We attribute the top-line success to high-impact, traffic-driving product news (Mac Jr., dollar coffee) and expect MCD to continue focusing on the value guest to recapture lost traffic to ... peers,"" Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh said in a research note.Wendy's (WEN) and Starbucks (SBUX) could be at some risk as McDonald's tries to balance better quality with value.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) reports quarterly results after the close Tuesday. Starbucks reports Thursday with its stock in a buy zone.Internationally, McDonald's said that the U.K. ""has not missed a beat since Brexit,"" but said diners in France had become more cautious following a string of terrorist attacks and an election characterized by rising populism on the left and right.The company's decision to sell much of its China and Hong Kong assets could contribute to ""choppiness"" in operating margins over the next few quarters, management said.RELATED:Chipotle Leads 5 Big Earnings Reports Tonight: What To ExpectStarbucks Reports Q2 Earnings Thursday: Watch This Key MetricStarbucks Breaks Out To 1-Year High As 'Unicorn' Tastes Like Victory

You should never buy a stock simply on ratings. But let's take a look of these five stocks, some of which are close to buy ratings.(Apple also is reporting on Tuesday. Apple has an 80 Composite Rating, reflecting its three-quarter string of declining earnings before a slim gain in its prior quarter. Analysts expect another modest rise in Tuesday's report. But the stock has been the top performer on the Dow Jones industrial average, and is still in buy range from a 141.12 three-weeks-tight pattern. Investors are looking ahead to the iPhone 8 later this year to reignite growth. Many also are hoping for Apple to return more of its huge cash hoard.)Facebook, which reports Wednesday, has a 96 Composite Rating.The stock had risen 29% in 2017 as of Friday.Facebook rose 1.5% to 152.46 on the stock market today, hitting a record high for a fifth straight session. The stock is well extended from any proper buy point.The social networking giant seems to have dealt with upstart Snapchat by cloning many of the Snap (SNAP) unit's most popular features, especially via Facebook's Instagram. Instagram recently topped 700 million users.Analysts expect Facebook to report 45% gains in earnings per share and revenue. That would actually represent the third straight quarter of decelerating growth for both, but it's excellent growth for so a large company with such stellar year-earlier comparisons.Qorvo, which reports Wednesday, has a 96 Composite Rating.

2288,CMG,"McDonald's (MCD) said Thursday it will serve fresh-beef Quarter Pounders, cooked when ordered, in most of its restaurants by the middle of next year, marking the latest move the company has made to keep apace in an industry migrating toward fresher ingredients and mobile technology.The decision follows the chain's plans announced earlier this month to launch a mobile order and pay system. The company is also testing food delivery and plans to expand the number of restaurants that offer table service and self-ordering kiosks.McDonald's shares rose 0.4% to 129.32 on the stock market today, trading just below a 130.10 buy point all month. McDonald's hit an all-time high of 131.96 last May.Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) dipped 0.4% to 55.96 but still near a 58.08 entry. Jack in the Box (JACK) edged up 0.8%, and Wendy's (WEN) added 0.7%.As fast-casual dining from Chipotle Mexican Grill (GMG) and others chipped away at sales of fast food's old guard a few years ago, McDonald's in 2015 began a massive turnaround effort that included restructuring the company and refranchising more restaurants, a move that helps shift costs onto independent owners. All-Day Breakfast and other menu items reawakened sales near the end of that year.The company has also pledged to use only cage-free eggs by 2025, and it eliminated artificial preservatives and high-fructose corn syrup from some items while vowing to serve chicken that didn't have antibiotics needed in human medicine.On Thursday, CEO Steve Easterbrook said in a statement that ""we are committed to transforming more aspects of our business, including offering a more modern and enjoyable dining experience, adding new levels of convenience and technology, and making more positive changes to the food we serve.""IBD'S TAKE: Smartphones and voice-controlled devices are likely to play a greater roll in the way people order out. Here's Domino's CEO Patrick Doyle's take on where the industry is headed. The fresh-cooked Quarter Pounders were tested in more than 400 restaurants across the Dallas-Fort Worth region and in Tulsa, Okla. McDonald's first said that it was testing fresh hamburger patties in May.The company said the tests received ""overwhelmingly positive feedback from customers and employees"" and were ""driven by the Franchisees, our region and insights from what our customers are asking for when they visit McDonald's.""But offering freshly cooked hamburgers could mean big adjustments to the way restaurants operate. Margins could also become more of a concern due to the costs of managing fresh food.While fresh Quarter Pounders would mark a move toward the high end, McDonald's has also stepped up its value offerings, including a cheaper coffee promotion and a promotion for $1 sodas and $2 McCafe that starts next month.Chipotle shares rose 2.3% to 444.24, clearing a short flat base to their best level since early June.RELATED:Big Mac Attacks: McDonald's Plots Its Next Strike In Burger WarsJack In The Box Finds A 'Forgiving' Late-Night-Delivery Customer

2313,CMG,"The improved industry trends follow ""very weak and volatile"" same-store-sales trends of both June and July, Derrington noted.

2404,CMG,"If there's one thing officials at Chipotle Mexican Grill want you to know, it's that it is not like other restaurant companies.Sure, Chipotle's (CMG) fast-casual Mexican eateries prepare food in kitchens and serve it to guests who pay money for the privilege, just like at other restaurants.And yes, business tends to pick up around lunch and dinner, when folks queue up to order the company's freshly prepared burritos, tacos and salads.And yes, Chipotle needs to keep food, labor and other costs in line if it wants to hit its margins and deliver the kind of profits that make investors tingle with joy.But that's where the similarities end — at least from Chipotle's point of view.""Our business is pretty different than others in the category in that we don't rely on some of the things others depend on, such as limited-time offers, merchandise ties and new menu items,"" said Chris Arnold, the company's communications director.No Smoke And MirrorsChipotle doesn't depend on ""gimmicks"" to drive customers through its doors, Arnold says. Instead, it relies on the company's ""food culture and people culture.""On the food side, Chipotle focuses on ""finding the best ingredients we can and preparing them using classic cooking techniques,"" Arnold told IBD.On the people side, the company looks to hire the right workers and develop them into managers.Ninety-eight percent of Chipotle's managers are hired internally from the company's rank-and-file crew, Arnold says. Last year it promoted more than 9,000 people into management positions.""This leads to a better customer-service experience and more operational efficiency,"" Arnold said.It's hard to argue with the results. Chipotle almost always churns out double-digit sales and profit growth and consistently ranks among the top stocks in the restaurant sector.Its financial might was on display during the second quarter, which Chipotle reported after the close on July 21.The company stomped all over earnings and sales estimates despite implementing its first price increase in three years to help cover higher food costs.The next day, Chipotle's stock price soared nearly 12% to 659.77 for the biggest single-day gain since last fall. Shares currently trade near 678.Chipotle logged earnings of $3.50 a share for the quarter, up 24% from the prior year and well ahead of estimates for $3.08 a share.Overall sales gained 29% to $1.05 billion, beating views for $989.55 million. It was the third straight quarter of accelerated top-line growth.Same-store sales climbed 17.3% vs. expectations for a 10.5% gain. Chipotle also raised its full-year same-store sales guidance to the midteens from its prior guidance of growth in the high single digits.""It's the best traffic number in the industry,"" Sterne Agee analyst Lynne Collier said after the earnings report. ""Rarely do you see numbers this high. Most of the companies we follow have recently put up flattish to slightly negative traffic numbers.""In a report, Citigroup analyst Gregory Badishkanian said there was ""no single driver"" of Chipotle's strong same-store sales performance, though he did point to a few key drivers.One was a bigger (though still small) contribution from Chipotle's catering business. It represented 1.6% of sales during the second quarter, up from 0.3% the prior year.Badishkanian also says Chipotle benefited from improved marketing during the quarter.Compared with other restaurant operators in the fast-casual and fast-food sectors, Chipotle doesn't spend a whole lot of money on marketing. While most companies spend 3% to 5% of their revenue on advertising, Chipotle spends 1.75%, Arnold says.""We are not pursuing the kinds of gimmicks that fast-food companies pursue, such as new products,"" he said. ""Those are very expensive; a lot of R&D goes into developing new menu items, then you have to spend a lot of money on marketing.""Instead, Chipotle focuses on non-traditional marketing efforts that range from producing Web videos and sponsoring food and music festivals to partnering with local farmer's markets.While marketing helps drive top-line growth, Chipotle looked to bolster its bottom line with a rare price increase during the second quarter to help offset rising costs of beef, avocados and cheese.""We generally try to hold the line on pricing and raise prices as a last resort,"" Arnold said. ""We just felt like we had to do it.""Badishkanian, who recently met with Chipotle management, noted after the meeting that the company is not seeing ""any impact"" from raising prices, and added that Chipotle still feels that its prices are too low in the Northeast.One reason customers aren't terribly concerned about the higher prices is they are confident in the quality and freshness of Chipotle's food, analysts say. That holds true not just for Chipotle, but also for other fast-casual chains such as Panera Bread (PNRA), Qdoba Mexican Grill — a division of Jack in the Box (JACK) — and Baja Fresh, according to a recent report from analysts at research firm Trefis.Top Of The LineFast-casual restaurants provide more ""freshly prepared and high-quality food than traditional quick-service restaurants (QSR), all in an upscale and inviting ambiance with meals ranging from $8 to $15,"" Trefis said, adding, ""Big QSR brands such as McDonald's (MCD), Subway and Starbucks (SBUX) have been facing a huge threat by the leading fast-casual restaurants, as the traffic growth in the latter segment surpassed that of every other segment for the fifth consecutive year (in 2013).""To help meet rising customer demand, Chipotle opened 45 new restaurants during the second quarter to bring the total to more than 1,600. That total includes 17 Chipotle restaurants outside the U.S. and seven ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen restaurants.The company also has a stake in one Pizzeria Locale in Denver.In any given year, about 80% of its expansion is in existing markets, Arnold says.""We have a pretty good idea of what the returns will be in those markets,"" he said.

2411,CMG,"Rob Williams, director of research at Sage Advisory in Austin, Texas, with $11 billion in assets under management:
"
2412,CMG,"Our outlook is optimistic on the economic front, but more cautious toward financial markets, as the favorable capital market conditions during the first half of the year are unlikely to persist the balance of the year. While equity fundamentals and global policy are supportive, higher valuations, geopolitical risk and weak growth abroad make us cautious about riskier market segments into year-end.
"
2413,CMG,"Specifically, within fixed income, we have lowered credit risk and added iShares MBS (MBB) to diversify our spread risk. And within high yield, we carry only short-duration high-yield ETFs, such as Pimco 0-5 Year High Yield Corporate Bond Index (HYS) .
"
2414,CMG,"Within equity allocations, we are avoiding higher volatility market segments such as small caps and favoring U.S. and emerging markets over other developed markets.
"
2415,CMG,"Going along with our more cautious theme, but wanting to participate in market upside, we have shifted much of our core U.S. equity exposure into a low-volatility focused position: PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV).

"
2417,CMG,"While the market is modestly overpriced, the trend remains positive and the Fed supportive. ""Don't fight the Fed"" remains the important theme. However, the market is expensive, the cyclical bull is aged and the Fed's quantitative easing policy is ending. Risk is high.
"
2418,CMG,"I believe rates should stay lower and for longer than what most might expect, which should support U.S. equities in the interim. The worst is yet to come as it relates to a sovereign debt crisis. It is reaching an advanced stage in Europe and Japan right now. I see their economic decline advancing and ultimately affecting us here until late 2015.
"
2419,CMG,"We are at the tail end of QE, and Europe and Japan are at the beginning. Our interest rates are currently higher than theirs, our overall debt is lower and our demographics are better. That favors the dollar for now, as well as U.S. equities.
"
2420,CMG,"It is widely anticipated that the Fed will begin to raise rates in mid-2015. It is typically the third rate rise that causes the market to change path (remember the ""three steps and a stumble"" rule). So my advice is to stay long equities but hedge that exposure and increase weightings to tactical ETF strategies. I believe Japan's stock market will rise, but their currency will decline meaningfully, especially against the dollar. I favor the currency-hedged WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity (DXJ).

"
2423,CMG,"The dollar is strong because foreign investors prefer U.S. stocks. We may see similar flow in the U.S. bond markets as stimulative monetary policy in other economies keeps rates there low relative to the U.S., possibly pushing U.S. yields lower, which would also drive stock prices higher.
"
2424,CMG,"A new addition to some of our models recently is iShares MSCI All Country Asia ex Japan (AAXJ). AAXJ provides exposure to large and midsize companies in emerging and developed Asian countries, excluding Japan. This ETF compares favorably against others with Asian exposure, demonstrating a lower probability of loss and lower downside volatility.

2425,CMG,"Brian Evans, owner of Madrona Financial Services in Everett, Wash., with $140 million in AUM:
"
2426,CMG,"Overall, the equity markets are widely viewed to be somewhat overvalued. The fear is that we could be facing a valuation adjustment where equities trading at premiums are sold and those at a discount are bought.

2430,CMG,"The market uptrend is under pressure and the distribution day count is high for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, but several large-cap names in this week's Big Cap 20 are holding gains and trading tightly after breakouts.A couple of other health care names and a railroad operator are acting well, too.After a bullish breakout during the week ended July 25, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) continues to hang near highs. It's a tad out of buying range after its July 22 gap up.On July 21, Chipotle reported solid earnings and sales as customers shrugged off higher menu prices. Quarterly profit rose 23% from a year ago to $2.50 a share. Sales growth accelerated for the third straight quarter, rising 29% to $1.05 billion.Same-store sales, which exclude sales at newly opened stores, rose an impressive 17.3%. The company opened 45 new restaurants in the quarter as its focus remains on U.S. growth.Facebook (FB), meanwhile, has been getting a lot of ink in IBD lately, and rightly so, because the stock still has the look of an emerging leader. It's still in buying range after clearing a third-stage, cup-with-handle buy point of 68.54. Facebook has gotten its house in order, and then some, after an inauspicious debut in May 2012.A flurry of better-than-expected earnings reports has helped. On July 23, the online social network reported Q2 profit of 42 cents a share, well above the consensus estimate of 32 cents a share, and a 121% increase from the year-ago quarter. Sales rose 61% to just over $2.9 billion.Mobile monthly active users rose 31% to 1.07 billion, while daily active users on mobile devices rose 39% to 654 million. Mobile ad revenue rose 41% to $1.66 billion.After a bullish breakout over 73.91 last month, drug distributor AmerisourceBergen (ABC) continues to hold gains and trade tightly. Shares remain under accumulation after the company's July 24 earnings report. Earnings growth accelerated for the third straight quarter, rising 29 to $1.01 a share. Sales rose 39% to $20.35 billion, helped by its recent pact with Walgreen (WAG).That long-term accord, announced in March 2013, included a 10-year pharmacy distribution contract.Medical products maker Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), meanwhile, is working on a long saucer-with-handle base with a buy point of 127.31. It's holding just above its 10-week moving average.And don't forget Canadian Pacific Railway (CP), which is finding support at its 10-week moving average after a recent breakout over 159.87. Support at the 10-week line is a good place to start a small position if the initial breakout is missed.Full-year profit at the railroad operator is expected to rise 21% this year and 24% in 2015.

2602,CMG,"It's sometimes awkward to be the first to arrive at a party, but in the stock market, there's nothing wrong with it all. It's called emerging leadership.In the early stages of a market uptrend, stocks coming out of the gate first — breaking out of bases — tend to go on to reap the biggest gains. They're typically industry group leaders showing high relative price strength due to signs of powerful institutional buying — not laggards that are far off highs due to shaky fundamentals.This is where investors often go astray when new money starts to come in from the sidelines after a market pullback. They focus on the laggards instead of the leaders.The best opportunities will come from stocks breaking out of bases with the best quarterly and annual earnings and growth, highest return on equity, biggest profit margin and strongest price action. A new product or service that's driving growth never hurts.After a general market decline runs its course, focus on stocks that held up well during the decline. If major averages pull back 10%, for example, focus on growth names that corrected only 15% to 25% — not those that pulled back 35% to 45%, or possibly more.Don't worry if you miss a few early breakouts. If it's a strong rally, there will be plenty more. Still, it's best to indentify the big leaders during the first few weeks of a new market uptrend.The Nasdaq confirmed a new uptrend on Sept. 1, 2010, rising 3% on the fourth day of a new rally attempt. The sign of strength came after an 18.7% pullback in the tech index earlier in the year. The Nasdaq rallied 33% over the next eight months, bringing several growth stocks along with it.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) cleared a second-stage cup-with-handle base on the same day the Nasdaq confirmed a new uptrend. At the time, it ranked No. 17 in the IBD 100 with a Composite Rating of 99.Shares surged 6% in more than double average volume, clearing a buy point of 154.53. It rallied 70% to a high of 262.77 in late November before forming a series of bases around its 10-week moving average (1).Chipotle's base showed a modest correction of 18% — not bad considering that growth stocks tend to fall 1.5 to 2.5 times the major averages during a market decline.

2640,CMG,"Three of the most powerful follow-throughs in recent times occurred in 1990, 1998 and 2010.
"
2641,CMG,"Two of them — on Sept. 1, 1990, and Oct. 15, 1998 — came during periods of financial turmoil or economic weakness. The success of those follow-throughs shows why it's important to tune out emotion and listen only to the market.
"
2642,CMG,"The follow-through is the market-bottoming signal discussed in this Investor's Corner series, which today looks at the results of these three follow-throughs.
"
2643,CMG,"The 1998 follow-through came shortly after Russia defaulted on its debt, setting off a chain reaction that led to the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, a giant hedge fund. The Nasdaq, which had hit a record high in late July, reversed course and lost a third of its value by early October.
"
2644,CMG,"The Oct. 15 follow-through came on the fifth day after the Nasdaq hit a low. The composite jumped nearly 5% in higher volume after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates. The index rose 57% in less than four months from the closing price on the follow-through.

2645,CMG,"The day after the follow-through, LED-lighting stock Cree (CREE) jumped above a 17.60 buy point and tripled. Other tech stocks also broke out and began big rallies. Dell (DELL) and Microsoft (MSFT) both rose nearly 60%. Investment brokerage Charles Schwab (SCHW) staged a powerful rally, clearing a 28.85 buy point of a cup-with-handle base on Oct. 14 and rocketing 537% in six months.
"
2646,CMG,"The Oct. 18, 1990, follow-through came as the major averages started to emerge from a bear market in which the Nasdaq fell as much as 31% from its peak. On the day of the follow-through, the government released data showing that housing starts fell for an eighth straight month, the longest slide since 1959.

2647,CMG,"Yet the Dow Jones industrial average gained 2.7%, the S&P 500 2.3% and the Nasdaq 2.2%, all in higher volume than the day before.

2665,CMG,"She turned down a headhunter five times in one month — passing on such enticements as higher pay and four weeks of paid vacation — but Lisa Aragon just couldn't get the job recruiter to take no for an answer.Aragon doesn't work in Silicon Valley or on Wall Street. Far from it. She manages a Wendy's (WEN) in Albuquerque, N.M. In 20 years, Aragon had never been pursued as aggressively as she had by the recruiter from the Pilot Flying J chain of truck stops, a major franchisee of fast-food restaurants.""I told him, 'I'm happy where I'm at,'"" said Aragon, 41, who already looked forward to quarterly bonuses and a bump for her work as a trainer. ""There's no need for change right now.""In today's tight labor market, restaurants are embroiled in a full-on food fight over workers. The rank-and-file is winning referral bonuses, free meals and days off, and the scarcity of candidates may be raising the minimum wage without help from lawmakers.The U.S. unemployment rate was 4.7% in December, near a nine-year low. With its insatiable appetite for new workers, the fast-food business serves as a leading indicator of a labor shortage. In September, annual turnover for restaurant workers jumped to 113%, the highest since industry-tracker People Report began collecting data in 1995.While that's good news for workers, it may not be for companies and customers. Restaurants will either have to raise prices or accept falling margins. Some stores' service is suffering.Andrew Puzder, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for U.S. Labor Secretary, will be acutely aware of the phenomenon. A foe of raising the minimum wage, he is chief executive of privately held CKE Restaurants, which owns the Hardee's and Carl's Jr. burger chains. Further intensifying demand for lower-skilled employees, Trump has promised to curb illegal immigration.""It's a hot job market,"" said Michael Harms, executive director of operations at Dallas-based TDn2K, People Report's parent. ""Every employee, whether they're 17 years old or 40 years old, has options.""Aragon's boss is already pulling out all the stops to keep employees. Over the last year, Eddie Rodriguez, who operates 177 Wendy's in Florida, New Mexico and Texas, raised hourly pay by nearly a dollar, to an average $9.05.Rodriguez gave referral bonuses of up to $250 to employees who found prospects. He offered more flexible schedules and used his own headhunters to find staff for his corporate office in Pompano Beach, Fla. He also makes sure he doesn't take anyone for granted.""Today's employee, they want to feel wanted,"" Rodriquez said.Customers, however, may feel less appreciated. Rodriguez can't find enough employees for the lunchtime rush, which means it takes longer to get a junior bacon cheeseburger.Diners also are kept waiting at Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), which is trying to hire about 600 ""crew members"" for its U.S. restaurants. To be able to pay more, the company, for the first time since 2014, is considering raising prices in some parts of the country.Chipotle is already paying an average $10 an hour. (For those inside the Federal Reserve looking out for evidence that the tightening labor market is sparking inflation, this could be exhibit A.)CEO Steve Ells in a December conference call complained that the lack of well-trained workers has resulted in napkins left on tables, untidy drink stations and slower meals.""We took our eye off the ball on the customer service side,"" Ells told investors.Restaurants aren't just competing with the fast-food joint down the street. Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) last year raised wages of more than a million employees to either at least $10 an hour or by 2% for those making more.Casual restaurants such as Olive Garden-owner Darden Restaurants (DRI) and quick-service haunts like Yum Brands' (YUM) Taco Bell are all struggling to hire.""It's as hard as it's ever been to attract and retain great people,"" said Greg Flynn, Chairman and CEO of Apple American Group, a franchisee of Applebee's, Taco Bell and Panera Bread (PNRA) restaurants.Terry Smith, a franchisee who owns three McDonald's (MCD) restaurants, said he has been able to avoid the crunch and maintain his staff of 150 to 160 employees with small perks such as free meals and paid days off. He also visits each of his restaurants every day, making sure he knows workers by name.""I rotate through the restaurants and they see me,"" he said. ""If you treat them right and have a vested interest in them, they'll stick around.""

2667,CMG,"Chipotle Mexico Grill (CMG) warned on fourth-quarter earnings early Tuesday, but the burrito chain's stock rose on an improving same-store sales trend.The fast-casual burrito restaurant, in an SEC filing, sees Q4 earnings per share of 50 to 58 cents, well below the 96 cents per share analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect.""During the quarter we incurred higher expenses compared to our originally-forecasted amounts in other operating costs, driven by increased promotional spend and costs related to testing television advertising,"" Chipotle said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.IBD'S TAKE: In an interview with IBD, Domino's Pizza CEO Patrick Doyle said phone-based ordering will soon look ""quaint"" and he was still assessing what companies like GrubHub and Uber Eats mean for the restaurant industry.Chipotle offered free food and launched a new Chiptopia loyalty program in an effort to win back customers over foodborne illness scares in 2015. While that was a summer program, some of the rewards were redeemed through year-end. Higher avocado costs also weighed on results.Chipotle sees Q4 revenue of $1.035 billion, up from $997.5 million a year earlier but below analyst views for $1.05 billion. It also warned that same-store sales fell 4.8% vs. a year earlier. But comps did improve during the quarter. Down 20.2% in October and 1.4% in November, they jumped 14.7% in December. Increasingly easier comparisons also helped.The company also announced a $100 million stock buyback. That's top of an existing $2.1 billion repurchase program that has $200 million remaining.Chipotle shares climbed nearly 5% to close at 414.48 on the stock market today.

2669,CMG,"Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), the burrito chain struck by a food-safety crisis last year, suffered its worst stock decline in six weeks after warning that deteriorating customer service is hampering comeback efforts.As the company works to bounce back from a widespread E. coli outbreak, it has lost its focus on the customer experience, co-Chief Executive Officer Steve Ells said on Tuesday. That's slowed down lines at its restaurants and undermined one of its former strengths.""I'm not satisfied with the rate of recovery,"" Ells said during a Barclays Plc investment conference in New York. ""I'm particularly not satisfied with the quality of experience in some of our restaurants.""The stock fell as much as 7.8% after Ells made the comments, marking the biggest intraday decline since Oct. 26. Even before the dip, Chipotle shares were down 17% this year. In recent action, shares were off 5.5% to 374.60.Chipotle's same-store sales — a closely watched measure — dropped 21.9% last quarter, worse than the 18.7% decrease projected by analysts. The chain's woes began late last year, when a series of foodborne-illness outbreaks scared away customers.The company has tried to get diners back by spending more on marketing and ads, establishing different food-safety protocols and introducing a loyalty program. But it's been a slower rebound than expected, Ells said on Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Chipotle are now roughly half of what they were worth before the food scare, when the stock peaked at 758.61. That's sent Chipotle toward the bottom of the rankings in IBD's Retail-Restaurant group. At the top of that food chain is Jack In The Box (JACK).Chipotle hit an ""inflection point"" in July, when it began gaining more customers than it was losing, Ells said. Trust in the brand also has have returned to near precrisis levels, he said. But slow customer service threatens to turn off customers if they come back to restaurants and they aren't perfect, according to Ells.The Denver-based company also said it's imposing a hiring freeze as it works to recover.""2016 has been the most challenging year in our history,"" Ells said. ""We obviously have a long way to go.""

2671,CMG,"Few Americans would think of fixing a Toyota Prius or a Chevrolet Volt on their own. Yet many ETF investors are confident they have all the skills needed to generate income from their portfolios.One strategist who's a pro at investing in ETFs considers a DIY approach to income investing less than ideal now, for two main reasons.First, index-tracking mutual funds and exchange traded funds simply won't generate the necessary yield to pay bills in retirement, with the S&P 500 and Barclays Aggregate Bond benchmarks both yielding around 2%. Second, interest rates have nowhere to go but up, making broad-based exposure riskier than at any time since the early 1980s. When bond yields go up, prices come down.""Going forward, bond allocations need to be unconstrained and tactical in order to find opportunity and avoid this risk,"" said Mike Sorrentino, chief strategist at Global Financial Private Capital.Special Report: Dividend And Income InvestingHe added: ""The days of easy income generation are over and are not coming back in our lifetimes. You can't fix cars on your own now; the world has evolved. And it's so much more difficult to generate income safely.""To achieve the income they need, investors may be tempted to stretch for the highest yields and unwittingly take on higher default risk. Or they be lulled into complacency, believing they cannot lose money in bonds — yet many fixed income currently have high (and rising) inflation or interest-rate risk, or both.IBD'S TAKE: U.S. Treasury bonds have fallen and yields have risen as traders and economists widely expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at the Dec. 13-14 policy meeting. Optimism is running high over Donald Trump's agenda of lower taxes and more infrastructure spending.So Sorrentino advises income investors to seek professional help to find safe and adequate income, with either an actively managed mutual fund or a money management firm.That does not mean it is impossible for investors to achieve attractive income at an acceptable level of risk on their own. In fact, exchange traded funds offer low-cost and transparent exposure to a variety of fixed income and equity income assets, many of which merit more attention.Sorrentino and Steve Blumenthal, founder and CIO of CMG Capital Management Group, shared some tips in recent phone interviews with IBD.First and foremost, be nimble, these investing experts say.Bond yields are mired near record lows but have been rising of late. Bond ETFs sold off postelection as the 10-year Treasury yield jumped from 1.72% to above 2%. It crossed a multimonth high of 2.50%, set in June 2015, on Monday and was at 2.473% Tuesday.To reduce potential risk from rising rates, Sorrentino favors portions of this asset class with less rate sensitivity, such as iShares 0-5 Year High Yield Corporate Bond (SHYG).It marries the ""best of both worlds — high-yield bond exposure and short duration,"" he explained. So when rates start rising, this ETF will see less volatility, while the credit risk of its underlying assets should get better if the higher rates accompany an improving economy.SHYG is up 11.8% year to date through Dec. 12 and has a 12-month yield of 5.64%.Sorrentino also likes Virtus Newfleet Multi-Sector Unconstrained Bond (NFLT), an actively managed ETF with a ""go anywhere, invest in anything"" strategy.The fund managers have so far nicely managed the strategy for a relatively high, but not outrageous, 0.80% expense ratio, he said.In terms of both income and rate sensitivity, this $193.7 million ETF in his view compares favorably with a far larger actively managed peer, $5.42 billion Pimco Enhanced Short Maturity (MINT).NFLT has gained 7.5% so far in 2016 vs. 2.0% for MINT, while offering a heftier yield of 3.83%.Meanwhile, Blumenthal warns that many fixed-income investors will be shocked when they wake up to their November statements. With the 10-year yield's massive move from 1.4% in July to 2.473% today, the price is down roughly 9%.""Who in the world was interested in bonds yielding 1.40%, yet record flows were racing into bond ETFs,"" Blumenthal said. ""Now, just four months later, nearly five years of earning 1.4% per year is lost. The safe money is not safe.""He advises ETF investors to diversify with trend-following, trading-based strategies.For example, the Zweig Bond Model suggests shortening or lengthening bond exposure as interest rates go up or down. It provides a disciplined, rules-based way to profit from shifting rates and can be implemented with ETFs such as SPDR Bloomberg Barclays 1-3 Month T-Bill (BIL), Vanguard Total Bond Market (BND) and iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond (TLT).Another alternative, his firm's CMG Tactical Fixed Income is available through managed accounts and ranks nine fixed income ETFs based on price performance. It then invests in the top two and is currently long SPDR Barclays Convertible Securities (CWB) and SPDR Barclays High Yield Bond (JNK).The CMG Tactical Fixed Income Index slipped roughly 0.81% in November while its benchmark, Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index, fell 3.97%. The strategy was up roughly 10% year to date as of Dec. 6 vs. a 2.56% stumble for the benchmark, according to Blumenthal.He advised investors to have a flexible approach to fixed income in the current environment.""It is not a time to buy-and-hold bond ETFs,"" he said. ""That doesn't mean you shouldn't have fixed income exposure, it means you should think about your fixed income exposure differently.""Outside bonds, Sorrentino likes the hybrid securities known as preferred stocks for their lower correlation to traditional stocks and bonds, as well as their high yields.Preferred stocks give owners a higher claim on a company's assets and earnings than common stock, but don't carry voting rights. They generally yield more than common stocks but have limited potential to appreciate in price, like bonds.At least nine ETFs tap this asset class, including $16.61 billion iShares U.S. Preferred Stock (PFF).The $223.9 million Global X SuperIncome Preferred (SPFF), which targets the 50 highest dividend-paying preferred securities, is focused entirely on financials.Sorrentino finds that attractive given his outlook for the sector.SPFF has advanced 3.4% since the start of 2016 and it yields 7.00%, outpacing PFF on both counts.Income investors also can diversify their portfolios with ETFs that invest in energy infrastructure companies and real estate.Known as MLPs (Master Limited Partnerships) and REITs (real estate investment trusts), these securities pay out most of their earnings as dividends to shareholders in exchange for favorable corporate tax treatment.They also make it easy and possible for individual investors to own a stake in large-scale, income-producing commercial properties.Dozens of ETFs and exchange traded notes offer exposure to domestic and global REITs, as well as MLPs. Some even offer potentially tasty yields — as high as 20% — without a strong correlation to interest rates.Sorrentino likes and uses Vanguard REIT (VNQ), but tends to avoid MLP ETFs. That is in part because his clients dread the cumbersome K-1 tax forms that MLPs generate.They can also be very volatile. Investors also should be aware that REITs are down double-digits from their July highs, at least in part due to concerns about the impact rising interest rates could have on their business.High-yielding utility and dividend ETFs also are popular choices for equity income. However, Sorrentino is wary of their stretched valuations and questions their future growth potential as they trade near historic highs.Instead, he finds ""very nice income"" in individual stocks such as BP PLC (BP), Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM).Companies in integrated oil services, such as BP, have yields as high as 7.0% and should be resilient in the unlikely event of an energy sector rout, Sorrentino explained.""If BP goes out of business, then we have a bigger problem,"" he quipped. Besides paying very strong dividends, many integrated oil stocks are cheap at current valuations, he added.Then Sorrentino added on a more serious note: ""Buying stocks for income requires a tremendous amount of skill, education and experience. Most individual investors should not be buying dividend-paying stocks on their own.""RELATED:Which Of The Best ETF Investment Strategies Is Right For Your Portfolio?Flexibility Is Needed For New Era Of Income InvestingProfits From Stock Gains And Augment A Low-Yielding PortfolioHow To Find Dividend Stocks With Staying Power

Shares closed down 1.9% to 405.67. The stock has been struggling to recover since a wave of food-borne illness outbreaks hit many locations across the country late last year. But the stock actually began selling off a year ago, when Chipotle reported slowing growth. Shares have moved sideways in recent months, but haven't been above their 200-day line in a year.Chipotle has taken longer than many expected to regain lost customers. A summer rewards program, Chiptopia, was criticized for being both too complex and too generous. And Chipotle is trying to bounce back at a time when restaurants generally are struggling. Menu prices have risen much faster than the cost of cooking your own food, while rising labor costs further squeeze chains.RELATED:Apple, Chipotle, Edwards Life Earnings Due: What To ExpectRobots Could Push 'Fight For 15' Backers Out Of WorkEstimates: EPS up 2% to $1.34.

2675,CMG,"Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and Panera Bread (PNRA) report third-quarter results after the close Tuesday. Here's a look at what to expect.Analysts expect Chipotle's earnings per share to plunge 65% to $1.59, with overall revenue down 10% to $1.088 billion.Same-store sales are expected to drop around 18%, Cowen & Co. said last week, citing Consensus Metrix estimates.The slide in same-store sales would come as Chipotle struggles to rebound from last year's foodborne illness scare. While the company expressed optimism about its three-month Chiptopia rewards program, other reports indicate that customer traffic has been lethargic despite the chain's marketing efforts.Some, however, remain bullish on the company longer-term.""Our favorable view on CMG shares reflects our belief that over time the CMG customer will forgive and forget recent food safety issues and resume patronage at levels similar to the past,"" Buckingham Research analyst John Zolidis said in a research note last week.Shares rose 0.35% to 413.39 in the stock market today. The stock has tried in recent weeks to reclaim support at its 200-day line, most recently bouncing off the underside of the key measure this month and trending lower.Wall Street expects Panera Bread to grow EPS by 1.5% to $1.34. Revenue is expected to increase 2.5% to $681.32 million. Comps are seen rising 3.8%.""We acknowledge PNRA sales may have slowed along with the industry in 3Q, but we continue to believe the company is out-executing the competition in a tough industry backdrop,"" Cowen analyst Andrew Charles said in a research note.IBD'S TAKE: Value deals at fast-food restaurants have become more common as food costs fall. But eating at home has become cheaper as well, while labor costs continue to rise in the fast-food sector.As with other restaurants, Panera Bread has tried to introduce higher quality ingredients to draw health-conscious consumers, and its loyalty program, mobile app and online ordering platform appear likely to help the company in the quarters to come.A Jefferies research note released this month pointed out Panera's loyalty program has 23 million members, while digital ordering accounts for 18% of the company's sales. Panera introduced Panera 2.0, its digital ordering technology system, in 2014.BTIG analyst Peter Saleg said in a research note last week that ""we consider Panera Bread to be one of the companies best positioned to leverage digital ordering and delivery. We believe that after two years of investment and earnings pressure behind digital, results have begun to materialize that should accelerate as Panera 2.0 and delivery are deployed across the system.""Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Papa John's (PZZA) have also benefited by their investments in digital ordering.Panera was up 0.9% to 198.62, climbing closer to its 50-day line.RELATED:McNuggets, McPick 2, Breakfast Help McDonald's Beat Restaurant SlumpDunkin' Sales Dip Unexpectedly; Starbucks Plans Tokyo RoasteryStarbucks To Double Its Coffee Shops In China To 5,000Alphabet And Chipotle: The New Flying Burrito Brothers

2676,CMG,"Weak earnings from Apple (AAPL) fueled selling in the Nasdaq Wednesday, but the weakness wasn't as pronounced in the S&P 500.At the close, the Nasdaq composite lost 0.6% as it seeks support at its 50-day moving average again. The S&P 500 dropped 0.2%, and small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 down 0.9%. The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.2%, helped by strength in Boeing (BA) and Nike (NKE). Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in slightly higher than Tuesday's levels.Wednesday's after-hours sessions served up plenty of earnings winners, including Tesla Motors (TSLA), up 6%, ServiceNow (NOW), up 4%, and VMware (VMW), up 2%.Oil prices reversed lower despite a government report that showed U.S. crude stockpiles unexpectedly decreased last week. December West Texas intermediate crude fell 78 cents, or 1.6%, to settle at $49.18 a barrel.Weakness in Nasdaq 100 bellwether Apple weighed on sentiment as shares gapped down and lost 2%.IBD'S TAKE: Give Apple credit. It's still holding above its 50-day moving average amid mixed analyst commentary around its Q4 results.Boeing (BA) led a rally in aerospace and defense stocks. Other big gainers in the group included Flir Systems (FLIR) and TransDigm Group (TDG). Earnings reports were the catalysts for Boeing and Flir Systems. Boeing jumped nearly 5% to 145.54. It cleared a base with a 139.55 buy point. Flir surged 10% while TransDigm added 1%.Wall Street also didn't like reports from Edwards Lifesciences (EW), Chipotle (CMG) and GrubHub (GRUB) as losses ranged from 9% to 17%.Edwards reported its second-straight quarter of 20%+ earnings and sales growth, but sales missed expectations. Earnings and sales came up short at Chipotle. GrubHub beat handily on earnings and sales, but a 19% rise in active customers disappointed.Trucking stocks outperformed as strong earnings from small cap Saia (SAIA) gave the group a lift. Shares jumped 14% to 33.28. The stock cleared a flat base with a 32.35 buy point.Akamai (AKAM) also bucked the trend, soaring nearly 15%.

2677,CMG,"Stocks remained stuck in the red early Wednesday. Earnings reports continued to dominate the market, as Apple's (AAPL) results late Tuesday weighed.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 fell 0.5% each; the Dow Jones industrial average shed 0.4%. Volume was tracking slightly higher on the NYSE but lower on the Nasdaq vs. the same time Tuesday.The Dow was a sea of red in today's stock market action, led by Apple's 4% drop. Shares gapped down below a 116.28 alternate entry but remain above a prior 110.33 buy point and the 50-day moving average. The stock fell back into buy range from 110.33, though all purchases are riskier with the market uptrend under pressure.After the close Tuesday, the iPhone maker reported mixed fiscal Q4 results with a slight earnings beat and a revenue miss. Analysts were mixed: Stifel cut its Apple rating and price target, while Piper Jaffray raised its price target.Also among blue chips, Boeing (BA) slid 1.4% despite reporting better-than-expected Q3 results and lifting its full-year earnings and commercial aircraft delivery outlook. The stock is shaping the right side of flat base with a 139.55 buy point.But Northrop Grumman (NOC) gapped up and soared 3%, clearing a 224.22 flat-base entry in fast turnover. The defense contractor announced Q3 earnings and sales that beat views and raised its full-year guidance for both the top and bottom lines.Back to the downside, Edwards Lifesciences (EW) plunged 13%, gapping below its 200-day line in massive trade. Late Tuesday, the medical products maker's Q3 earnings met, but revenue missed views.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) gapped down and sank 7% in hefty volume to a more than three-year low.

2678,CMG,"U.S. stock indexes battled to overcome turbulence midday Wednesday after a slew of issues suffered bearish gap-down moves at the open.The Nasdaq itself gapped down as much as 0.7% and then backfilled the gap to a 0.3% loss. The early dunking took the composite back to its 50-day line, where it found support and bounced up. The S&P 500 was flat, while the Dow Jones industrial average advanced 0.3%.Volume in the stock market today was running modestly higher on both major exchanges compared to the previous session.An unusually high number of blue chip stocks suffered gap downs at the open. A gap down occurs when a stock opens and stays below the lowest price in the previous day's range. In the S&P 100, which is comprised of the biggest blue chips in the S&P 500, a dozen stocks gapped down. This is unusual for conservative stocks.S&P 100 gap downs included Simon Property Group (SPG), Apple (AAPL), and home-improvement chain Lowe's (LOW).Some of the early gap downs reversed to fill in all or part of the gap as the session continued.IBD'S TAKE: The gap downs ought to make individual investors think twice before buying a stock, but Northrop Grumman gapped up into a buy zone Wednesday.In some cases, the negative reactions seemed a bit excessive. Dow transports member Southwest Airlines (LUV) gapped down 11% in torrid volume despite earnings that topped the consensus estimate by about 6%. Revenue fell shy of expectations by 0.6%, and guidance was weak. The company said it expected Q4 unit revenue to decline 4% to 5%.A strong market might have shrugged off the negatives and focused on the earnings beat, or at least contained the damage. But this market is clearly under pressure.Growth stocks also suffered gap downs. Medical-device maker Edwards Lifesciences (EW) was off 13%; online food delivery service provider GrubHub (GRUB), 8%; pizza chain Papa John's (PZZA), 4%; surgical products firm Zimmer Biomet (ZBH), 3%; internet content company Line (LN), 6% and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), 8%.RELATEDChanging Focus Helps Coca-Cola Beat Earnings EstimatesWhy Does Wall Street Like Clinton?

2679,CMG,"Even as Jack in the Box (JACK) appears poised for a windfall from looser marijuana laws nationwide, Goldman Sachs says that diminishing benefits from California's minimum-wage hikes and Taco Bell's focus on breakfast and $1 offerings pose risks to the burger chain.Jack in the Box's same-store sales have likely been helped by California's minimum-wage increases, said Goldman Sachs, which initiated coverage of the stock Monday with a sell rating and an 88 price target. But rising unemployment in the state during the fourth quarter could work to neutralize demand.Taco Bell's recent focus on breakfast, begun in 2014, and a $1 breakfast menu launched this March have also made competition more difficult for Jack in the Box, Goldman said. The $1 price is something a burger chain ""would struggle to replicate,"" analyst Karen Holthouse wrote in the firm's initiation note.""Taco Bell has one of the most flexible menus for engineering entry-level value,"" she wrote, ""and it plans to emphasize its all-day $1 menu in its fall creative.""The two chains also have a large presence in California — both have their roots in the state — and also vie aggressively for the attention of millennials, Holthouse noted.Jack in the Box's own Mexican chain, Qdoba, also faces competition from an array of fast-casual rivals, including Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), which reports earnings Tuesday. But its push into catering could present future opportunities, Holthouse said.Jack in the Box fell 1.5% to 97.06 in the stock market today. Yum Brands (YUM), Taco Bell's owner, rose 1% to 87.80.IBD'S TAKE: Value deals like Taco Bell's $1 menu offerings have become more common as food costs fall. But eating at home has become cheaper as well, while labor costs continue to rise in the fast-food sector.However, Goldman noted, Jack in the Box's year-over-year comparisons get easier as the company laps ""promotional mismatches"" in its fiscal 2016 and McDonald's (MCD) launch of All Day Breakfast.As promotional competition adds to many restaurants' struggles this year, McDonald's and Domino's Pizza (DPZ) were outliers in the third quarter. McDonald's remains popular among younger diners. Domino's, meanwhile, has been helped in part by its digital ordering platform.McDonald's fell 0.3% to 113.57 Monday, after rising 3% Friday on its stronger-than-expected earnings.Domino's Pizza rose 0.1% to 166.53 after surging 10% last week to a record high on its booming earnings.As other chains contend with consumer anxiety about the presidential election, Jack in the Box's prospects look a little brighter elsewhere on the ballot.""Within quick-service,"" Cowen & Co. said in a research report last month, ""we note Jack in the Box has the greatest exposure to recreational marijuana use becoming more widely accepted in states that have already legalized use (10% of the store base), as well as 5 states with an upcoming legalized recreational use proposal on state ballots for the November election (52% of the store base).""RELATED:Kroger Is Latest To Warn On Food Deflation, Doesn't Fear Wal-MartMcDonald's: Labor-Saving Self-Order Kiosks Are Not A 'Risk' To JobsWhat Jack In The Box, 'Hunger Games' And 'Seinfeld' Have In Common

2680,CMG,"Ronald McDonald is keeping a low profile until all those creepy clown sightings subside, but McDonald's (MCD) is expected to produce a profit when it reports third-quarter earnings and revenue results on Friday.Analysts forecast per-share profit growing 6% to $1.49, which would mark a sequential deceleration from the previous quarter but the fifth straight quarter of year-to-year earnings gains. Revenue is seen declining 5% to $6.28 billion, however — a potential ninth consecutive quarter of sales tumbles.McDonald's is still a top five brand in young people's minds, according to Piper Jaffray's latest teen survey, although it has slipped in the rankings from No. 3 to No. 5 over the last three years among upper-income teens. With average-income teens, the Big Mac maker fell to No. 3 from No. 2.McDonald's shares lost 1% to 111.25 at the close Tuesday. The stock continues to trade below its 50-day and 200-day lines after breaking support at both key moving averages in late July.Last week, the company said that it expects to incur about $130 million in pretax charges in the third quarter, which comes out to 12 cents a share post-tax, as part of its global general and administrative and refranchising strategy, first announced in November of last year.IBD's TAKE: McDonald's franchisees don't feel great about business, according to a new Nomura survey, which noted that both franchisees' business outlooks and corporate-relations sentiments have declined: ""McDonald's Franchisees Are In A Funk — Like Its Stock.""Restaurant stocks have broadly been declining in recent months, with IBD's Retail-Restaurants group trading below its collective 50-day and 200-day lines.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) shares edged down 0.1% to 393.36.Domino's Pizza (DPZ) reported earlier Tuesday, handily beating on the top and bottom lines. Pizza stocks like Domino's and Papa John's (PZZA) are faring better than their fast-food and sit-down restaurant peers as diners seem to be eating in more amid macro anxieties.Domino's surged nearly 5% to 159.45 while Papa John's climbed more than 3% to 79.59.RELATED:Domino's Pizza Q3 Earnings Beat As U.S. Comp Sales Jump 13%Buy McDonald's, Sell Netflix, Analysts Say; Google Gets 1000 Price TargetDo McDonald's Japan Sales Point To 'Pokemon Go' Fatigue?

"
2682,CMG,"Now that activist investor Bill Ackman's Pershing Square has disclosed a 9.9% stake in Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), the hedge fund might push the embattled fast-casual chain away from discounting and toward, say, branding and breakfast. Or the fund might shake up the company's board. Or Chipotle could find itself on an entirely different -- albeit very unlikely -- path, like, say, getting repurchased by McDonald's (MCD).Such was the range of speculation among analysts a day after Pershing Square disclosed its stake, a move that lifted Chipotle shares 5.9% to 438.45 in the stock market today. After a foodborne-illness scare last year battered the chain's reputation, sales and shares, the stock is now as close to its 200-day line as it's been since last October.In an SEC regulatory filing, Pershing said Chipotle had a ""strong brand"" and ""visionary leadership,"" and that its stock is ""undervalued and is an attractive investment.""The fund said it intended to discuss an array of issues about Chipotle's direction with the company's management as they try to regain consumer trust through menu additions, discounts and loyalty programs. The company's first better-burger location, a Shake Shack (SHAK)-like outfit called Tasty Made, is set to open this fall.While Pershing Square's move makes management a bit more likely to effect changes that would please shareholders, it would also likely mean continued volatility for Chipotle's shares, Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski said in a note.Meanwhile, Credit Suisse cautioned against refranchising its restaurants to independent owners in attempt to shift the burden of labor and other costs.""The typical activist 'playbook' in restaurants has called for a combination of refranchising, cost-cutting and leverage,"" Credit Suisse analyst Jason West said in a report.""However,"" he continued, ""in our view, these options are less appealing in CMG's case given a high current valuation, lack of franchising historically, and since CMG would be selling stores that are significantly diminished relative to historic peak volumes and profits.""West suggested that Pershing might try to push Chipotle to move away from store growth and discounting -- the latter of which he said investors haven't been keen on -- to focus more on existing restaurants and the Chipotle brand. He also said Pershing could steer Chipotle toward international markets and toward things like breakfast, drive-thrus and more effective digital engagement.Buckingham Research analyst John Zolidis on Wednesday took a more open-ended tack, wondering how Chipotle's problems could be threaded into a concrete investment angle.He wrote that investors have expressed dissatisfaction with a wide range of topics -- slow developments internationally and technologically; complaints around management's structure and compensation; an unsatisfactory response to food-safety issues. But none of those complaints, he said, appeared ""to come together into a coherent, specific course of action that would unlock shareholder value.""While he emphasized that Chipotle's main focus needs to be on regaining trust among diners, he also wondered if McDonald's could end up repurchasing the fast-casual chain.""This idea has been mentioned to us more than once,"" he wrote.The idea is that if McDonald's, once a majority owner of Chipotle before Chipotle grew up to become an archenemy, repurchased the Mexican chain, the burger giant would have a way to keep growing. Moreover, McDonald's has the resources to clear the lanes for Chipotle's international expansion and make it easier to franchise Chipotle's restaurants, he wrote.""Frankly, we believe a McDonald's-Chipotle transaction has peu de chance (little chance)"" he wrote. ""Rather, we mention it in an effort to be comprehensive as we speculate on a possible activist angle for this investment.""IBD'S TAKE: With the U.S. elections and a wave of summer violence making the world a more stressful place, many consumers have been less inspired to eat out. Cheaper groceries and the economy haven't helped, either. Even Dave & Buster's, whose stock had been on the cusp of a breakout, sank Wednesday on disappointing quarterly results. RELATED: Big Mac Attacks: McDonald's Plots Its Next Strike In Burger WarsInvestors Are Losing Faith In McDonald's, Losing Hope In Chipotle

2683,CMG,"Drones have been used or tested for military combat, surveillance, racing, filmmaking, insurance, agriculture and utility maintenance, and sending medical supplies. Some have speculated that, years away, drone technology will become the basis for the aerial counterpart of self-driving vehicles that companies like Uber, Tesla (TSLA) and, reportedly, even Apple (AAPL) are envisioning for the roads.But amid the headiness about the future, drones in today's still-primitive times will begin to cross an equally crucial frontier: burrito delivery.Last month, the FAA gave Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) permission to test its Project Wing drones for delivery. Between then and now, Project Wing, part of Google's special projects lab, has wasted no time, landing the FAA's OK to collaborate with Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and Virginia Tech to stage a trial run of burrito deliveries, via automated drones, on the school's campus.The delivery tests, among the largest undertaken in the nation, start this month and will end a few weeks later, Bloomberg reported. Deliveries will take place on a closed portion of the campus, CNN said. Drones aren't permitted to fly over people, so participants in that location will be shielded.The burritos will be taken from a Chipotle food truck by the drones, which will lower the food to people ordering it several hundred meters away, CNN said. The testers are also looking to see whether the food's packaging can hold up and maintain heat as the burritos sail against breezes, birds, particulate matter or whatever else is in the low-altitude airspace.IBD'S TAKE: Chipotle got a lift after an activist investor disclosed a 9.9% stake in the company, but the stock is still struggling after a foodborne-illness scare damaged the company's reputation and sales. While the restaurant sector overall has struggled, Papa John's remains in buy range.  While Amazon (AMZN) has gotten approval to test drones for eventual package delivery, Chipotle is not alone in its interest in the aerial devices. A Domino's Pizza (DPZ) international franchise also recently successfully tested the delivery of a pizza via drone.The burrito tests come as the FAA tries to catch up with the number of businesses finding reasons to put drones in the sky. FAA rules governing small drone usage took hold at the end of August, but as safety concerns abound, the agency has been reserved about allowing deliveries.Shares of Alphabet closed down 0.6% in the stock market today, and Chipotle dipped 0.5%. Domino's eased 0.8%, and Amazon finished essentially flat.RELATED:Chipotle Jumps Late On 9.9% Pershing Square StakeWhy Domino's, Papa John's Are Hot Restaurant Stocks NowAckman's Chipotle Menu?

2684,CMG,"Wall Street economists expect Friday's jobs report to show that the economy added 180,000 jobs in August as the jobless rate dipped to 4.8%.That would be a solid gain, but not likely strong enough to prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its September meeting, especially after Thursday's surprisingly weak ISM manufacturing index.Other details also will be key: What happened to the workweek, which averaged 34.5 hours in the latest report? Did wage growth rise from July's 2.6% annual rate?If anything, wage growth is likely to surprise on the upside. Since the start of July, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) tellers and Starbucks (SBUX) baristas got a significant bump in pay, while Wendy's (WEN), Ross Stores (ROST), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and others have said in corporate earnings calls that they're paying more as they compete for top talent, incentivize performance and keep up with minimum-wage laws. While these are anecdotal reports, federal taxes withheld from paychecks, the broadest gauge of the health of the job market, are growing at the fastest rate in nine months.So what would it take to prompt the Fed to action later this month, instead of waiting until December for the next hike, as markets currently expect?""It will have to be a real blockbuster to trip a September move,"" says Dan North, chief economist at trade credit insurer Euler Hermes North America.What qualifies as a blockbuster? In North's view, that might mean 250,000 new jobs, ""plus strong wage growth, increased hours, increased participation.""Wages, hours and participation all provide a signal as to how much slack remains in the labor market. If those elements of the report signal weakness, North figures an addition of 290,000 jobs in August would be needed to provoke the Fed to act at its next meeting.IBD'S TAKE: With wage growth picking up, investors may want to focus on companies with a strong enough position in their markets to withstand labor inflation without suffering a hit to profit margins. Read this Investor's Corner on studying profit margins and check out IBD Stock Checkup to see how your stocks rate.Some Fed policymakers have said that the economy is close to full employment. At that point, the theory suggests, employment growth that exceeds growth in the labor force will increase upward pressure on wages.In a report this week, Wells Fargo Chief Economist John Silvia and colleagues estimated that any job growth above 95,000 per month now reduces labor market slack. That's lower than it's been because of the slower growth of the potential labor force as baby boomers retire.""A slowdown (in job creation) may very well be needed to avoid overheating and cause the Fed to tighten policy faster than expected,"" the Wells Fargo team wrote.
"
2685,CMG,"McDonald's (MCD) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) showed bearish action on the stock market Friday, as investors remained somewhat squeamish about restaurant trends generally.McDonald's fell 1.8% to 115.01 on Friday, hitting the lowest level in six months. It was the weakest close since early December. McDonald's is still struggling from reporting weaker-than-expected Q2 U.S. comps, partly due to broader consumer weakness. The all-day breakfast menu introduced late last year had fueled a turnaround, but investors are worried about growth drivers as comparisons get tougher.Meanwhile, McDonald's faces rising labor costs due to minimum-wage hikes and the company's own wage increases. Rising costs and weaker comps will squeeze margins, said Argus Research last week as it downgraded McDonald's.IBD'S TAKE: Rising labor costs are a problem for fast-food chains generally. Fast-food prices have never risen so fast vs. the cost of eating at home.  Chipotle Mexican Grill retreated 1.6% to 388.50, a three-year closing low. Chipotle is still trying to recover from last year's food-borne illness outbreaks. It's introduced a new menu item -- chorizo sausage -- and introduced its first loyalty program, Chiptopia. Chipotia is generous but complicated, so it's unclear how many people will use it aggressively and whether they'll keep dining at Chipotle in October.Starbucks (SBUX) fell 1.1% to its lowest level in nearly two months. Like McDonald's, Starbucks reported weak U.S. comps for its latest quarter but said that was an anomaly, vowing improvement. Still, a few days after the earnings report Starbucks stock met resistance at the 200-day line and began retreating, falling through its 50-day average as well.On the upside, Domino's Pizza (PZZA) and Papa John's (PZZA) have delivered strong results, sending shares to highs.Jack in the Box (JACK) spiked after its earnings report earlier this month and is now trading just below its all-time high of 99.99 set in March 2015.

2686,CMG,"McDonald's (MCD) on Tuesday said it expected foreign-exchange rates to hit earnings per share harder than anticipated this year, partly due to the U.K.'s vote last month to leave the European Union. Meanwhile, its shares tumbled on weaker-than-expected U.S. same-store sales.CFO Kevin Ozan said on the burger chain's second-quarter earnings call Tuesday that it expected the tougher foreign-exchange environment to shave 2 to 4 cents off third-quarter EPS estimates and 9 to 11 cents off its full-year EPS target. The pound plunged against the dollar following the ""Brexit"" vote, and currencies elsewhere have weakened amid economic anxieties.Still, McDonald's said it had not seen any significant change in demand in the U.K. following the vote, and it did not expect the vote to affect food costs in the near term. McDonald's also said it expected U.S. food costs to ""remain favorable"" and stay relatively flat internationally.The company warned that labor costs were rising in many of its markets. Management also said on the call that the company's sponsorship of the Rio Olympic Games next month would keep third-quarter general and administrative costs higher, but without having much effect on general business trends.The burger chain also reported weaker-than-expected second-quarter revenue and U.S. same-store sales on Tuesday.Total revenue fell 3.6% vs. a year earlier to $6.265 billion. Analysts had expected $6.27 billion. Global same-store sales, excluding currency effects, rose 3.1% vs. estimates for about 3.6%. International comps were in line, but U.S. comps rose just 1.8% vs. targets for about 3.2%.McDonald's earned $1.45 a share, beating analysts' expectations for $1.38.Shares of McDonald's fell 4.5% to 121.71 on the stock market today. That undercuts a 124.18 buy point cleared on July 19 and puts the stock just below its 50-day moving average.IBD'S TAKE: McDonald's is the world's largest restaurant operator, but it's No. 21 in IBD's Retail-Restaurant group. To see how MCD stacks up against the top eateries in objective criteria, go to IBD Stock Checkup.McDonald's said its All Day Breakfast menu and McPick 2 offerings remained strong, but it noted ""softening industry growth."" CEO Steve Easterbrook on the call also discussed a ""broader level of uncertainty"" in consumers' minds, saying that global turmoil and the election season has made diners more cautious.But analysts have been concerned that All Day Breakfast had been doing a bit too much of the hard work in improving sales. SunTrust Robinson analyst Jake Bartlett said that McDonald's results ""demonstrate that it is not immune to slowing industry trends."" Jefferies analyst Andy Barish said Tuesday that softer comps and higher labor costs mean ""at least 18 months of challenges"" for the restaurant sector.Easterbrook said its planned additions to its All Day Breakfast menu, set for September, would help ""reinforce the baseline momentum"" in the fourth quarter, which could be particularly difficult to lap on a year-over-year basis. The company's launch of All Day Breakfast last October drove sales improvement during that period, after struggling to compete with fast-casual restaurants.But Easterbrook said the company was focused on longer-term sustainability.""We are playing the long game,"" he said on the call, later adding, ""We're not going to manage it by quarter.""Stifel Nicolaus on Tuesday downgraded a slew of restaurant stocks, betting that the U.S. will enter a recession within nine months. Stifel analyst Paul Westra downgraded a number of eateries to hold from buy, including highly rated Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) and Dave & Buster's (PLAY). Texas Roadhouse plunged 5.9%, but found support intraday around its 50-day line. Dave & Buster's sank 3.4%.Stifel cut Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) to sell from hold. Chipotle was off 2.4%.Not all was awful, however. Easterbrook touted McDonald's recent agreement to incorporate its Japan restaurants into the augmented reality game Pokemon Go, saying McDonald's was ""enjoying what it's doing for our business in Japan."" However, the company would not say whether it planned to expand that arrangement to other markets.

2689,CMG,"A Marvell Technology (MRVL) patent settlement, a Chinese takeover of Ingram Micro (IM), NetApp (NTAP) layoffs and weak Jack in the Box (JACK) earnings moved those stocks in after-hours action Wednesday.Ending litigation that started in 2009, Marvell Technology agreed to pay $750 million to settle a patent infringement lawsuit filed by Carnegie Mellon University over disk drive technology.The settlement was announced six months after a federal appellate court vacated a record $1.5 billion judgment against Marvell and ordered a new trial. But the court also ruled that Marvell must pay at least $278.4 million in damages.A federal jury in Pittsburgh had awarded Carnegie Mellon $1.17 billion in damages in 2012. The trial judge later raised that total to $1.5 billion, reflecting Marvell's alleged willful infringement plus interest.A ""substantial share"" of the $750 million settlement will go to the inventors of the disputed technology, minus legal fees and costs, Carnegie Mellon said.Marvell shares rose more than 6% after hours.China-based Tianjin Tianhai Investment will pay $38.90 a share, or $6 billion, for Irvine, Calif.-based information technology company Ingram Micro.Ingram Micro stock soared 24% after hours when news of the deal broke.Tianjin Tianhai is a unit of Chinese shipping and aviation conglomerate HNA Group. Some of Ingram Micro's customers include Apple (AAPL) and Cisco Systems (CSCO).The offer represents a 31% premium on Ingram Micro's closing price of 29.65 on Wednesday.McDonald's (MCD) launch of its all-day breakfast menu hurt Jack in the Box during the latter's fiscal first quarter, sending its shares plunging nearly 20% after hours.For the three-month period ended Jan. 17, the San Diego-based fast food restaurant chain earned 93 cents a share, flat from a year earlier and 10 cents below estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 0.5% to $470.8 million, missing estimates of $475.5 million.""We believe a competitor's messaging around its launch of all-day breakfast had some impact on our results, particularly in the 10:30 a.m. to noon period,"" Jack in the Box Chairman and CEO Lenny Comma said in a statement.McDonald's launched its all-day breakfast menu during Q4, which helped the Oak Brook, Ill.-based fast food giant post its best U.S. quarterly sales in nearly four years.Same-store sales at Jack in the Box's subsidiary Qdoba rose 1.5% at company-owned locations, less than previous projections of 2%. That's despite rival Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) reporting plunging Q4 and January same-store sales due to food-borne illness scandals.Jack in the Box narrowed its full-year earnings guidance to  $3.50 to $3.63 a share, compared with the previous range of $3.55 to $3.70 a share.The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based data-storage company announced a plan to axe 12% of its workforce, or nearly 1,200 workers, as NetApp aims to cut $400 million in costs.NetApp estimated that it will book between $60 million and $70 million in costs tied to the layoffs during its fiscal Q4.For its fiscal Q3, the three-month period ended Jan. 29, NetApp earned 70 cents a share excluding items, down 6.7% from a year earlier, and beating by 2 cents estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue fell 10.6% to $1.4 billion, missing estimates of $1.5 billion.NetApp also gave light Q4 guidance.But NetApp stock rose 2% late.
"
2690,CMG,"All-day breakfast and adjustments in food-prep helped McDonald's (MCD) beat fourth-quarter estimates Monday, indicating the fast-food mainstay’s strategy to compete with newer alternatives is working.U.S. comparable sales, a figure considered pivotal to the company's rebound efforts from years past, surged 5.7%. That was far above Wall Street forecasts for around 3% growth and marked a second consecutive quarterly increase after two years of declines. Milder weather during the quarter also helped.""We are demonstrating that our turnaround plan is key to restarting growth and becoming a modern and progressive burger company,"" said CEO Steve Easterbrook, who took over last March and launched all-day breakfast in October.In a statement, he later added: ""As we enter 2016, we expect continued positive top-line momentum across all segments.""Shares closed up 0.7% Monday after climbing as much as 3% earlier to touch an intraday high. The stock has rallied more than 30% from a year ago.McDonald's earnings per share during Q4 jumped 16% from a year earlier to $1.31, topping forecasts by 8 cents. Sales fell 4% to $6.34 billion. But the decline, weighed by the strong dollar, wasn't as bad as expected. Analysts had modeled a slip in sales to $6.2 billion.Globally, comps rose 5%. In the company's high-growth markets, operating income jumped 27%, helped by an easier comparison in China, where the company suffered from a food safety scare in 2014 after a supplier sold expired meat to McDonald's and Yum Brands' (YUM) KFC.McDonald's management on an earnings call said it's mulling a sale of part of its stake in the company's struggling Japan business and plans to open 250-plus restaurants in China this year. In Australia, all-day breakfast will launch nationwide this quarter, the company said.As part of its new approach, McDonald's has embraced more natural ingredients, offered deals through its mobile app, and experimented with customizeable burgers. But it was all-day breakfast that dominated the discussion -- and the U.S. comp growth.""Our guess is this result implies the chain outperformed the fast-food industry by about 3 (percentage points),"" RBC Capital Markets said in a research note. ""While input costs have started to turn favorable for McDonald’s (and projected to be down 1-2% in 2016), we believe that All Day Breakfast was also a contributor to lower cost-of-goods percentages.""Company-operated restaurant expenses fell 7% during the quarter. Breakfast items are generally cheaper as they relate to cost of sales, noted Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh, and beef costs have dropped as cattle herds expand.He also pointed to other changes that likely contributed to the rebound, such as searing beef patties better, toasting buns just before giving burgers to customers, and making the menu board more efficient.""I think there’s been a number of operational improvements that they’ve done that have been mostly behind the scenes,"" Slabaugh told Investor's Business Daily.McDonald's Q4 success comes after years of struggles for the chain, which had suffered as more diners, seeking fresher, higher-quality fare, flocked to fast-casual outlets like Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG).But Chipotle has had problems of its own, namely a foodborne illness outbreak last year that has forced the company into damage control. Shares of other fast-casual chains and fast-food rivals have also drifted lower, while McDonald's shares have risen in recent weeks.Chipotle closed down 1.9% Monday and have plunged more than 40% since October. Once high-flying Shake Shack (SHAK) has tumbled 59% from its peak.Shares of Yum Brands, Burger King parent Restaurant Brands (QSR), Wendy’s (WEN) and Jack In The Box (JACK) have lost ground too.Piper Jaffray analyst Nicole Miller Regan also noted that some rivals in the sector are only starting to tweak their strategies, while McDonald's is putting its own in place.""They spent the last 12-plus months creating strategy, and now they’re executing,"" she told IBD.

2693,CMG,"A winter storm bearing down on the East Coast will likely have a significant impact on sales at publicly traded restaurants with a large exposure to the area, with Darden Restaurants (DRI) and Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) considered to be two of the most vulnerable.Winter Storm Jonas is expected to unload heavy snow and possible blizzard conditions on large swaths of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, including major metro areas like Washington, D.C., New York and Philadelphia. Because the storm will hit over the weekend, when a lot of eateries see heavy traffic, restaurant operators are bracing for a big slowdown in revenue.""We see the snowstorm headed for the East Coast, which to date has had a rather uneventful winter, as a significant weather event for this weekend,"" Maxim Group analyst Stephen Anderson noted in a Thursday morning report. That's especially true for full-service restaurant chains that depend on weekend traffic for a big chunk of their business, he said.""Casual-dining restaurants with a significant exposure to weekend traffic in the Northeast, particularly Darden and Texas Roadhouse, will be most affected by the storm,"" Anderson said, adding that both companies have more than 20% of their units in the affected states.Anderson sees a more limited impact on quick-service and fast-casual chains, with the most affected there expected to be Dunkin' Brands (DNKN), Panera Bread (PNRA) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG).""However, we contend that these chains can take some solace in the fact that they are more dependent on weekday traffic than on weekend traffic, and that temperatures in the area are forecast to rebound above freezing for the work week, thereby minimizing the potential impact for these names,"" Anderson said.Shares of Darden, whose holdings include the Olive Garden and Capital Grille chains, rose 1.1% on the stock market today. Texas Roadhouse fell 1.25%, Dunkin' rose 1% and Panera fell 0.65%. Chipotle fell 0.9% as it attempted to crawl back up from the pounding it has taken following E. coli and norovirus outbreaks at some of its restaurants.Meanwhile, airlines have issued warnings due to the storm. Southwest Airlines (LUV) announced a travel advisory stating that its Friday and Saturday services will likely be delayed, diverted or cancelled. Delta Airlines (DAL) issued an advisory as well and said travelers flying through certain parts of the affected areas from Jan. 22 to Jan. 24 are entitled to refunds if their flights are canceled or significantly delayed.Follow Vance Cariaga on Twitter: @IBD_VCariaga.

2803,CMG,"Shares of Del Frisco's Restaurant Group (DFRG) set another new high in the stock market today, continuing a run-up that has seen the operator of upscale steakhouses and other eateries rise by nearly half over the past five months.Del Frisco, based in Southlake, Texas, operates restaurants under the Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House, Sullivan's Steakhouse and Del Frisco's Grille names. Its stock price climbed to a record high of 27.15 in Wednesday afternoon trading, after setting an all-time closing high of 26.75 on Tuesday.The company has run off nine straight quarters of double-digit revenue growth, though its bottom-line performance has been a little shakier. Over the last five quarters, Del Frisco has reported lower EPS three times and flat EPS once.The company did produce a decent gain during the 2013 fourth quarter — growing year-over-year earnings 16% to 36 cents a share — though that was below views for 38 cents.""Quarterly results fell short of our expectations due to a combination of factors — inefficiencies at four newly opened Grille restaurants, slightly later new restaurant openings within the quarter, lower operating leverage on the 17th week than we had anticipated, and weather issues during our very profitable holiday season,"" CEO Mark Mednansky said in a release.On the upside, revenue for the quarter climbed 21% to $97.5 million, the biggest gain since the March 2012 quarter. Comparable restaurant sales increased 2.8%.At the end of 2013, Del Frisco's owned and operated 40 restaurants in 20 states and Washington, D.C. These included 10 Del Frisco's units, 19 Sullivan's units, and 11 Del Frisco's Grille locations.Analysts expect the company to grow its restaurant count substantially in coming years.""We see DFRG as an under-the-radar unit growth story that should receive a more appropriate valuation as new units continue to outperform and the company's exposure to a higher end consumer produces steady results,"" Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh noted in a report.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Del Frisco's to grow annual earnings 11% this year and 21% in 2015.The company has a high IBD Composite Rating of 96, out of a possible 99. It is part of IBD's Retail-Restaurants group, which ranks No. 48 among 197 industries tracked by IBD. The only two higher-rated names in the group are fast-casual Mexican restaurant operators Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and Fiesta Restaurant Group (FRGI).Not a lot of the stocks in the group cater to the upscale dining space. One of them that does — Ruth's Hospitality Group (RUTH), owner of the Ruth's Chris Steak House chain — has delivered robust EPS growth in recent quarters, though sales growth has decelerated or been flat the last four quarters.The group's largest name by market cap is McDonald's (MCD).

"
2923,CMG,"2014: A Look Back And AheadThe top of Chipotle Mexican Grill 's (CMG) menu could easily headline a tasty strategy:Keep it simple.Such is the way co-CEO Monty Moran steers his firm to the top of the fast-casual restaurant segment.""It's simple, really,"" he told IBD. ""Better-quality food tastes better, and really great people make better food and provide a better customer experience.""Its menu is simple. So is its restaurant format, making it easy for patrons to get served fast when lines stretch out the door.It's hard to believe that Chipotle is still in the early stages of growth, but that's exactly the case. It operates about 1,600 restaurants in America, with a small presence internationally — in Canada, England, France and Germany.That domestic focus will continue in 2014, with the firm planning to open 180 to 195 units. ""There's room for thousands more restaurants in the U.S.,"" Moran said.Moran is looking at 2014 the same way he's looked at every year since he was appointed to the post by founder and co-CEO Steve Ells in January 2009.""There's a sense of increased optimism,"" Moran, 47, said. ""While I can't predict exactly what the economy is going to do in 2014, I know that we have loyal customers. This, along with great food and a sound unit economic model, will keep us on track regardless of what the economy is doing.""Moran has proved he's committed to changing food culture — while he's overseen a 1,000% stock shot the past five years, including a 79% advance in 2013.Digging InChipotle has shown it can execute during tough economic times. Moran pointed out that during the depths of the recession in 2008-09, the chain was the last to succumb to economic weakness and the first to benefit when the economy started to improve.""Our comps held up longer than anyone's during the last recession,"" Moran said. ""And they got stronger earlier coming out.""In 2008, when most other firms showed annual earnings declines, annual profit at Chipotle rose 11% from 2007. In 2009, annual earnings jumped 67%.In 2014, the company is expected to open more ShopHouse SouthEast Asian Kitchen locations. It now operates six — three in Washington, D.C., three in Los Angeles.Then there's pizza. Expect Chipotle to make noise in that arena after its recently announced partnership with Pizzeria Locale in Denver, where Chipotle is headquartered.CEOs are necessarily fixated on the bottom line, but Moran learned early on that worrying about profit doesn't generate profit.""You'll never hear me talking about profits or getting sales up,"" Moran said. ""We tell people to make great burritos and provide great restaurant experiences. The rest will take care of itself.""Chipotle's food costs are high — usually a drag for restaurants — but in 2012 annual pretax margin hit an all-time high of 16.8%.Robust sales have a lot to do with it. In October, Chipotle reported a 6.2% increase in same-store sales, beating analysts' expectations of 4.8% same-store sales growth. The company's restaurants open for at least a year average $2.1 million in sales per year.R.J. Hottovy, a senior restaurant analyst at Morningstar, thinks the fast-casual space could have another solid year in 2014: ""Chipotle is one of the more intriguing concepts to emerge out of the restaurant space over the last decade. They've pioneered and perfected the fast-casual concept, which has become the sweet spot in the industry. It's more cost-efficient to run than a casual dining location.""As Chipotle cooks up more ideas for 2014, Moran again keeps it simple: ""If you look at innovation as new menu items, new dollar menu items and value meals, we're the least innovative."" The way his company improves is via better raw ingredients, sharp cooking methods and making sure restaurant teams are the best they can be. ""The goal is to empower top-performing people to achieve high standards.""In sports, athletes' greatness is measured by how they make teammates better. So it is with Chipotle's people culture. Individual store managers, called restaurateurs, are the most important employees, said Moran: ""We evaluate our leaders based on how powerfully they make the people around them better. It's not good enough at Chipotle to be good at what you do. You have to make people better too. The goal is to create a situation where employees feel confident in their abilities and encouraged by their circumstances so they feel like they can be at their best.""Moran's way of communicating came in part from studying communications at the University of Colorado, where he graduated in 1988.Then it was on to law school at Pepperdine University in Southern California, where he graduated in 1993. Wanting to be a trial lawyer, he joined Morris Polich & Purdy in Los Angeles and zeroed in on small cases so he could develop into a prime attorney.Three years later he moved back to Colorado and joined Messner Reeves.In the meantime, Moran walked down the aisle. He and Kathy have been married 17 years and have three children.Moran rose through the Messner Reeves ranks fast, becoming a partner in just two years and CEO soon thereafter.Much of Chipotle's culture comes from Moran's experience at Messner Reeves. He was all about delegating, which helped create a stable of empowered lawyers who worked hard to satisfy clients.So how does a trial lawyer ascend to co-chief executive at one of the world's most robust restaurants?Moran and Ells were high school classmates and became friendlier during Monty's college days. Moran would catch dinner at Ells' house, where Steve served up gourmet, scrumptious food.One night he had the pleasure of trying an Ells burrito. Monty was stunned at how delicious it was and heard from his pal that he planned to open a restaurant and serve them.Moran didn't need convincing. He started doing legal work for Chipotle in the mid-1990s in the early stages of the company's expansion, mostly working on leases.On BoardChipotle was so impressive, McDonald's (MCD) expressed an interest in buying it in 1998.After making an investment in the Denver-based chain, the Big Mac team sent its general counsel, Jeff Kindler, to review Messner Reeves' legal work.Kindler and Moran hit it off. The counsel could see Moran's passion for his work and promptly sent a memo up the McDonald's chain with this recommendation: Retain Messner Reeves for all Chipotle legal work.Moran didn't forget. After Kindler's run as CEO of Pfizer (PFE), he eventually joined Chipotle's board.Finally, in March 2005, Moran accepted a position as president and chief operating officer with Ells' company and became co-CEO on Jan. 1, 2009. ""I told Steve I wasn't sure how I was qualified to be CEO,"" Moran said.Ells' answer: The position was more about Moran than the title and that he'd figure it out.Said Moran: ""I remember Steve telling me, 'Monty, the thing you're best at is leading people. The lawyer part is secondary. You lead a successful law firm with 50-60 employees. What about coming to a place with 8,000 employees?'""The challenge appealed to Moran, who shares this lesson: ""I realized that leadership was a more valuable trait than being a top-notch trial lawyer.""

2934,CMG,"Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) whet Wall Street's appetite with third-quarter sales that beat views late Thursday and a double-digit profit gain. But higher food costs kept profits leaner than expected.
"
2935,CMG,"Earnings rose 17.2% to $2.66 a share, short of analyst forecasts for $2.78 a share. That was still an acceleration from the 11% gain in profits it saw in Q2.

"
2939,CMG,"""It was a strong top-line quarter, but higher food costs took a bite,"" he said.
"
2940,CMG,"Higher ingredient costs were driven by increased prices for tomatoes, corn and tomatillos in its salsas as well as higher costs for dairy and chicken, the company said in a statement.
"
2941,CMG,"Restaurant-level operating margin was 26.8% in the quarter, a decrease of 60 basis points from the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by higher food and marketing costs partially offset by favorable sales leverage.

2950,CMG,"The 50-day line is shaping up as a battlefield for many Big Cap 20 stocks.Ideally, a stock's trip back to its 50-day line, or 10-week line as some prefer, should be in quiet volume. If the stock bounces off the line in fast trade, then a secondary buy zone can be established.In some instances, an entry at the 50-day line can be an early buy in what eventually becomes a base.For example, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), which was No. 9 in the Big Cap 20 on Dec. 10, returned to its 50-day line in mid-December. Volume was quiet on the descent.On Dec. 20, the stock bounced off the line in twice its usual volume. Investors could have bought anywhere from 516 to 533 that day.Chipotle consolidated for about three weeks after its bounce off the line — completing a cup-with-handle base. The entry was 537.10.Although a Jan. 9 breakout came in volume 65% above average, the stock never found further traction. The breakout failed.Investors who bought on the 50-day bounce might have eventually exited the trade with a small profit. Those who bought at the breakout lost money.The point here isn't that the 50-day line is preferable to a breakout. But the case does illustrate that the key area can sometimes give the investor one more tool in how to play a stock.A number of stocks on Monday's preliminary list for the Big Cap 20 are battling at the 50-day line.Facebook (FB) retreated to its 50-day line over four sessions. The first three days involved losses in below-average volume. On Monday, volume picked up, and the stock bounced up after touching the line. At its nadir, the stock fell almost 6% below its 54.93 buy point.Priceline (PCLN) made a 52-week high last week and then pulled back. On Monday, Priceline sliced under the 50-day line in heavy volume.Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) retreated to the 50-day line in above-average volume. However, on Monday the stock rebounded off the line in strong volume.Celgene (CELG) broke under its 50-day line in fast trade Friday and lost more ground Monday.Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) is back at the 50-day line, but hasn't made a decisive move above or below the line.Google (GOOG) made a decent move up off the 50-day line Monday, after briefly violating the line. Volume was strong.Netflix (NFLX) closed under its 50-day line for 11 straight sessions and then gapped above the line in big volume Thursday. The stock recrossed a 368.75 buy point and is in a buy zone up to 387.19.A softening market could define the outcome of these battles at the 50-day line. However, should the Federal Reserve deliver a surprise Wednesday when its two-day meeting concludes, that could become the deciding factor.
"
2951,CMG,"Second In A SeriesWhen a follow-through day ushers in a new uptrend, investors need to start hunting right away for leading stocks breaking out.Remember: CAN SLIM is not a system for buying market proxies. It's a method for buying stocks of companies with top-notch earnings and sales growth and market-dominating products and services. The market is a traffic signal to let you know whether you should be buying stocks or waiting on the sidelines.Leading stocks can make for much better gains than the market. In a rip-roaring bull market, it's not uncommon to see leaders double in price or even more after breaking out of bases.Many of the biggest winners will stage breakouts in the first few weeks of the follow-through. Some leaders will even break out on the day of the follow-through.So be alert for any leaders clearing well-formed chart patterns. The number and the quality of stocks breaking out after a follow-through can tell you about the strength of the market. Breakouts from thin, low-priced, fundamentally weak issues don't point to a healthy market.Breakouts from chart patterns such as the cup, cup with handles, double bottom and flat base are the primary setups investors should look for.A breakout from a base is a critical juncture for a stock. After weeks or months in consolidation, the stock should emerge in strong price and volume action.It's best to see a stock close near its session high and above the base's buy point. You'd want to see solid demand on a breakout. So volume should be at least 40% above average. The higher the turnover, the better.There are many resources in IBD and online at Investors.com that can point you to leading stocks staging breakouts. Intraday market updates on Investors.com, The Big Picture, IBD 50 and Your Weekly Review are just a few resources.On Sept. 1, 2010, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) cleared a cup-with-handle base (1) at 154.53, as the Nasdaq staged a follow-through. Volume surged twice its average. At the time, Chipotle sported a 97 EPS Rating, a 96 RS, and an A SMR grade.Chipotle surged a red-hot 70% before cooling off to test its 10-week moving average. (2)

2952,CMG,"Lead manager Matthew Kamm works the market like it's a garden with variety. He treats his young sprouts differently from his mature produce, and both of those differently from crops he's ready to reap.
"
2953,CMG,"This approach is working. It has made his $9.7 billion Artisan Mid Cap Fund a top performer among the largest diversified U.S. stock portfolios.
"
2954,CMG,"In the 12 months ended Jan. 31, its 31.18% return topped 91% of its midcap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. Its 16.94% average annual gain in the past three years topped 92% of its rivals.
"
2955,CMG,"Kamm, 40 years old, discussed his investment course with IBD from his office in Milwaukee.
"
2956,CMG,"IBD: In addition to Mid Cap, you run $906 million Artisan Global Opportunities and $1.7 billion Small Cap . How does managing different cap-size and style funds help you?
"
2957,CMG,"Kamm: Our team includes a group of analysts and five portfolio managers who work collaboratively to identify best ideas. We've been at this over 15 years. That level of tenure and trust is important.
"
2958,CMG,"We look up and down the market-cap scale and globally. That gives us broad perspective. We like to think we're better midcap investors because we know small-cap competitors and international emerging markets competitors that U.S. midcap companies increasingly face.
"
2959,CMG,"IBD: You divide your portfolio into three types of stocks. What's the advantage?
"
2960,CMG,"Kamm: The nomenclature we use is garden, crop and harvest.
"
2961,CMG,"Garden stocks are ones we believe are just emerging. We try to be early into them. We guard against risk by keeping garden positions small.
"
2962,CMG,"When a garden position turns out right and profit growth plays out, we allocate more into it and push it into our crop bucket or portfolio. Those are our largest positions and fewest positions. That's where we feel the profit cycle has been largely de-risked.
"
2963,CMG,"The third area is harvest, where we reduce positions.
"
2964,CMG,"IBD: How are you tweaking new buys to cope with the expected slow-growth economy?
"
2965,CMG,"Kamm: We've been focused on uniquely positioned franchises that are exposed to some strong growth trends. You see some signs, especially in the U.S., that the economy is getting better. Housing and jobs are examples. But emerging markets are struggling to grow at the same rates they experienced a few years ago.
"
2966,CMG,"We're focused on durable, high-quality franchises. We're less interested in high-commodity businesses and materials. And those business models are very cyclical, economy sensitive, but tend not to meet our franchise characteristics criteria.
"
2967,CMG,"IBD: What are some real-world examples, please, as of your latest disclosure?
"
2968,CMG,"Kamm: We're focused on innovation in health care. We're 10 years past the first sequencing of the human genome. Now we're seeing benefits in novel drug targets.
"
2969,CMG,"Regeneron (REGN) is an example. They have a drug called Eylea, which is a retinal drug for age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness for the elderly. It was launched in 2011. In its second full year it sold $1.4 billion. It's a strong driver of company sales and profits.
"
2970,CMG,"Regeneron also has a diverse pipeline of additional opportunities to extend its profit cycle into the future.
"
2971,CMG,"They were all discovered in Regeneron's own labs, but primarily funded by Sanofi, a large French drug company, in return for the ability to market these drugs and share profits.
"
2972,CMG,"IBD: Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) recently gapped up after reporting strong results and guidance. Its 30% earnings per share growth was the second straight quarterly acceleration. What's your thesis?
"
2973,CMG,"Kamm: We think they're positioned for growth. They have a very strong brand associated with high-quality ingredients. They have a significant opportunity to grow their footprint of restaurants in the U.S., and ultimately internationally.
"
2974,CMG,"They're executing well. They're getting customers through serving lines quicker. They've enhanced menus. They're offering office catering. They're able to drive solid same-store comps year-over-year and make restaurants more profitable through higher volumes.
"
2975,CMG,"They've resisted increasing prices to the same extent that a lot of restaurants have. Instead, they're driving growth through higher volume and traffic.
"
2976,CMG,"IBD: Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) has had a great run and just gapped up the other day. What makes you think it still has room to run?
"
2977,CMG,"Kamm: It fits our innovation theme. Their sales and profits are driven by Solaris, a biologic drug that's approved for two ultrarare, very serious diseases, not just in the U.S. but globally.
"
2978,CMG,"They still have room to run because both uses of Solaris still have a lot of growth ahead of them. There's still a lot of opportunity to reach more patients.
"
2979,CMG,"Solaris is also being tested for three or four additional ultrarare diseases, where early clinical data are encouraging. In three or four years, there will be additional (treatment) approvals for Solaris.
"
2980,CMG,"They also have asfotase alpha (which targets certain bone diseases and tooth losses), which is expected to be approved later this year.
"
2981,CMG,"IBD: Is broker-dealer LPL Financial (LPLA) a play on a growing economy?
"
2982,CMG,"Kamm: They're the largest independent broker-dealer in the country. They've grown by attracting financial advisers away from big banks and wire houses, giving them independence to grow their practices in ways they see fit, and letting them keep a larger percent of their profits.
"
2983,CMG,"They continue to gain market share, and we like market-share gainers. We like companies that can outgrow the market in a sustainable way.
"
2984,CMG,"Also, LPL captures some of the float on cash balances that customers keep with them. (Float refers to earnings on cash between the time a customer authorizes disbursement and when the cash actually leaves the account.) While rates were low, there was not so much float to capture. But if rates rise as the economy improves, then LPL earnings will accelerate.
"
2985,CMG,"IBD: Where's the innovation in a stock like athletic wear seller Under Armour (UA)?
"
2986,CMG,"Kamm: The innovation is in new materials that deliver better performance, whether sweat-wicking or shielding athletes from heat or cold. Companies like Under Armour and Nike (NKE) and Adidas have been able to grow by innovating product lines and driving increased value to customers.
"
2987,CMG,"Under Armour has a great brand with athletes, especially young athletes, who are inclined to spend more. They're expanding into other categories, such as footwear via cleats. And that's translating into more traditional ware like running shoes.
"
2988,CMG,"They've been mostly a U.S. brand, but they're extending their brand internationally and driving additional growth outside the U.S. So we think they still have a long runway. They're in our bucket category.
"
2989,CMG,"IBD: Am I right in thinking you like Illumina's (ILMN) genomic sequencing advances?
"
2990,CMG,"Kamm: Gene sequencing is a transformational technology. In 2007 they launched a next-generation sequencing platform. Cost of sequencing began to fall, leading to big growth in the market. They launched (on Jan. 14) another new product (the HiSeq X Ten) that delivers the first $1,000 genome, a target that researchers have been fixed on for five or six years.
"
2991,CMG,"So they're the center of action in human genetic research and have significant growth opportunities as they make these tools even more affordable.
"
2992,CMG,"IBD: TripAdvisor (TRIP) has pulled back from its Nov. 15 high. And earnings per share fell in the most recent quarter. Why aren't you concerned?
"
2993,CMG,"Kamm: They're the leading review site for hotels and other travel destinations globally. They've moved toward a bidding model, where companies bid for placement on a TripAdvisor site. It's almost like bidding for Google (GOOG) search terms. Earnings have declined during this process because it is a transition. They're foregoing some older advertising measures as they move customers to the new bidding system. Until this new system starts to mature, their profits are lower.
"
2994,CMG,"This was expected. That's why it's a garden investment. It will move up as they get through the transitional period.
"
2995,CMG,"IBD: Cepheid (CPHD) has uptrended since June. Why has it shown so much volatility in quarterly earnings?
"
2996,CMG,"Kamm: This is a crop position. They make diagnostic systems that let hospitals easily identify molecular markers of disease in patients. That used to be a complex, time-consuming process that required highly trained staff. Cepheid made GeneXpert, which automated it. You put a blood sample into a plastic cartridge, which goes into the instrument, and you get the answer. So more hospitals can do molecular testing.
"
2997,CMG,"The company ran into manufacturing challenges, which hurt earnings. Over (the past year) they've addressed those issues, exited 2013 in a better place in terms of inventory and ability to provide test cartridges to customers. And they have a broad pipeline of new tests that they've brought to market. Now they have to leverage their new systems to do a broader range of tests.
"
2998,CMG,"IBD: Is Fortune Brands (FBHS) a play on the housing rebound?
"
2999,CMG,"Kamm: They're a leading housing-products company, and this is a crop position.
"
3000,CMG,"They have a leading position in fixtures for kitchens and bathrooms, cabinets, faucets and locks in what tend to be attractive segments. It became clear last year that the U.S. housing market was coming out of the depths of the downturn. Fortune has been gaining share in key markets. That's delivering strong margin expansion, and margins are still below the peaks of the last housing cycle, so it's reasonable to assume that margins can continue to rise.
"
3001,CMG,"IBD: The rate of growth of LinkedIn's (LNKD) earnings per share have declined for two quarters. You've added to your stake in several recent disclosures. What's your game plan?
"
3002,CMG,"Kamm: LinkedIn has transformed the recruiting and hiring market. The main advantage is that people update their resumes and profiles even when they're not actively looking for a job. People who are hiring can access a rich database of not just job-seekers but also of people who would be open to the right opportunity. That's valuable to corporate HR departments.
"
3003,CMG,"In recent years LinkedIn has been investing to improve its mobile smartphone and tablet tools and provide more content, more articles and experts who write on topics that are relevant. That brings people to the site more frequently and with a higher level of engagement. And that translates into more advertising dollars for LinkedIn. There's not only a growing number of recruiters who subscribe to the platform. There's also growing advertising business. All of this has a long way to run.
"
3004,CMG,"IBD: You began your current stake in Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL) in September. Why do you like this particular casino stock?
"
3005,CMG,"Kamm: They're a leading casino operator in Macau and the Cotai Strip (in Macau), which is well known as a high-growth market, noticeably larger than Las Vegas. The subtle shift in the market in recent years is that the market is no longer driven primarily by high rollers, ultrahigh net worth individuals gaming in Macau. It is driven by the mass market today.
"
3006,CMG,"Melco's properties are well positioned to serve the mass market. And that part of the market is more profitable than the high-net-worth part. Melco is working to open new properties, which will expand its earnings potential.
"
3007,CMG,"Also, transportation to Macau is improving. And we're seeing changes that make it more attractive for destination travel, not just gambling demand.
"
3008,CMG,"IBD: Your stake in Tractor Supply (TSCO) has edged up.
"
3009,CMG,"Kamm: They're the leading supply store for recreational farms and the rural lifestyle. They have 1,300 stores today. We think they have potential for at least 2,100 stores. As they grow, they've done a good job of increasing productivity of existing stores. They've done a good job of understanding their business data.
"
3010,CMG,"They've done a good job with e-commerce to leverage their brand outside their physical stores. They've done a good job of laying in private label goods within the store to provide different price points and help expand their own margins. All of those drivers have potential in the coming years.Lead manager Matthew Kamm works the market like it's a garden with variety. He treats his young sprouts differently from his mature produce, and both of those differently from crops he's ready to reap.This approach is working. It has made his $9.7 billion Artisan Mid Cap Fund a top performer among the largest diversified U.S. stock portfolios.In the 12 months ended Jan. 31, its 31.18% return topped 91% of its midcap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. Its 16.94% average annual gain in the past three years topped 92% of its rivals.Kamm, 40 years old, discussed his investment course with IBD from his office in Milwaukee.IBD: In addition to Mid Cap, you run $906 million Artisan Global Opportunities and $1.7 billion Small Cap . How does managing different cap-size and style funds help you?Kamm: Our team includes a group of analysts and five portfolio managers who work collaboratively to identify best ideas. We've been at this over 15 years. That level of tenure and trust is important.We look up and down the market-cap scale and globally. That gives us broad perspective. We like to think we're better midcap investors because we know small-cap competitors and international emerging markets competitors that U.S. midcap companies increasingly face.IBD: You divide your portfolio into three types of stocks. What's the advantage?Kamm: The nomenclature we use is garden, crop and harvest.Garden stocks are ones we believe are just emerging. We try to be early into them. We guard against risk by keeping garden positions small.When a garden position turns out right and profit growth plays out, we allocate more into it and push it into our crop bucket or portfolio. Those are our largest positions and fewest positions. That's where we feel the profit cycle has been largely de-risked.The third area is harvest, where we reduce positions.IBD: How are you tweaking new buys to cope with the expected slow-growth economy?Kamm: We've been focused on uniquely positioned franchises that are exposed to some strong growth trends. You see some signs, especially in the U.S., that the economy is getting better. Housing and jobs are examples. But emerging markets are struggling to grow at the same rates they experienced a few years ago.We're focused on durable, high-quality franchises. We're less interested in high-commodity businesses and materials. And those business models are very cyclical, economy sensitive, but tend not to meet our franchise characteristics criteria.IBD: What are some real-world examples, please, as of your latest disclosure?Kamm: We're focused on innovation in health care. We're 10 years past the first sequencing of the human genome. Now we're seeing benefits in novel drug targets.Regeneron (REGN) is an example. They have a drug called Eylea, which is a retinal drug for age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness for the elderly. It was launched in 2011. In its second full year it sold $1.4 billion. It's a strong driver of company sales and profits.Regeneron also has a diverse pipeline of additional opportunities to extend its profit cycle into the future.They were all discovered in Regeneron's own labs, but primarily funded by Sanofi, a large French drug company, in return for the ability to market these drugs and share profits.IBD: Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) recently gapped up after reporting strong results and guidance. Its 30% earnings per share growth was the second straight quarterly acceleration. What's your thesis?Kamm: We think they're positioned for growth. They have a very strong brand associated with high-quality ingredients. They have a significant opportunity to grow their footprint of restaurants in the U.S., and ultimately internationally.They're executing well. They're getting customers through serving lines quicker. They've enhanced menus. They're offering office catering. They're able to drive solid same-store comps year-over-year and make restaurants more profitable through higher volumes.They've resisted increasing prices to the same extent that a lot of restaurants have. Instead, they're driving growth through higher volume and traffic.IBD: Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) has had a great run and just gapped up the other day. What makes you think it still has room to run?Kamm: It fits our innovation theme. Their sales and profits are driven by Solaris, a biologic drug that's approved for two ultrarare, very serious diseases, not just in the U.S. but globally.They still have room to run because both uses of Solaris still have a lot of growth ahead of them. There's still a lot of opportunity to reach more patients.Solaris is also being tested for three or four additional ultrarare diseases, where early clinical data are encouraging. In three or four years, there will be additional (treatment) approvals for Solaris.They also have asfotase alpha (which targets certain bone diseases and tooth losses), which is expected to be approved later this year.IBD: Is broker-dealer LPL Financial (LPLA) a play on a growing economy?Kamm: They're the largest independent broker-dealer in the country. They've grown by attracting financial advisers away from big banks and wire houses, giving them independence to grow their practices in ways they see fit, and letting them keep a larger percent of their profits.They continue to gain market share, and we like market-share gainers. We like companies that can outgrow the market in a sustainable way.Also, LPL captures some of the float on cash balances that customers keep with them. (Float refers to earnings on cash between the time a customer authorizes disbursement and when the cash actually leaves the account.) While rates were low, there was not so much float to capture. But if rates rise as the economy improves, then LPL earnings will accelerate.IBD: Where's the innovation in a stock like athletic wear seller Under Armour (UA)?Kamm: The innovation is in new materials that deliver better performance, whether sweat-wicking or shielding athletes from heat or cold. Companies like Under Armour and Nike (NKE) and Adidas have been able to grow by innovating product lines and driving increased value to customers.Under Armour has a great brand with athletes, especially young athletes, who are inclined to spend more. They're expanding into other categories, such as footwear via cleats. And that's translating into more traditional ware like running shoes.They've been mostly a U.S. brand, but they're extending their brand internationally and driving additional growth outside the U.S. So we think they still have a long runway. They're in our bucket category.IBD: Am I right in thinking you like Illumina's (ILMN) genomic sequencing advances?Kamm: Gene sequencing is a transformational technology. In 2007 they launched a next-generation sequencing platform. Cost of sequencing began to fall, leading to big growth in the market. They launched (on Jan. 14) another new product (the HiSeq X Ten) that delivers the first $1,000 genome, a target that researchers have been fixed on for five or six years.So they're the center of action in human genetic research and have significant growth opportunities as they make these tools even more affordable.IBD: TripAdvisor (TRIP) has pulled back from its Nov. 15 high. And earnings per share fell in the most recent quarter. Why aren't you concerned?Kamm: They're the leading review site for hotels and other travel destinations globally. They've moved toward a bidding model, where companies bid for placement on a TripAdvisor site. It's almost like bidding for Google (GOOG) search terms. Earnings have declined during this process because it is a transition. They're foregoing some older advertising measures as they move customers to the new bidding system. Until this new system starts to mature, their profits are lower.This was expected. That's why it's a garden investment. It will move up as they get through the transitional period.IBD: Cepheid (CPHD) has uptrended since June. Why has it shown so much volatility in quarterly earnings?Kamm: This is a crop position. They make diagnostic systems that let hospitals easily identify molecular markers of disease in patients. That used to be a complex, time-consuming process that required highly trained staff. Cepheid made GeneXpert, which automated it. You put a blood sample into a plastic cartridge, which goes into the instrument, and you get the answer. So more hospitals can do molecular testing.The company ran into manufacturing challenges, which hurt earnings. Over (the past year) they've addressed those issues, exited 2013 in a better place in terms of inventory and ability to provide test cartridges to customers. And they have a broad pipeline of new tests that they've brought to market. Now they have to leverage their new systems to do a broader range of tests.IBD: Is Fortune Brands (FBHS) a play on the housing rebound?Kamm: They're a leading housing-products company, and this is a crop position.They have a leading position in fixtures for kitchens and bathrooms, cabinets, faucets and locks in what tend to be attractive segments. It became clear last year that the U.S. housing market was coming out of the depths of the downturn. Fortune has been gaining share in key markets. That's delivering strong margin expansion, and margins are still below the peaks of the last housing cycle, so it's reasonable to assume that margins can continue to rise.IBD: The rate of growth of LinkedIn's (LNKD) earnings per share have declined for two quarters. You've added to your stake in several recent disclosures. What's your game plan?Kamm: LinkedIn has transformed the recruiting and hiring market. The main advantage is that people update their resumes and profiles even when they're not actively looking for a job. People who are hiring can access a rich database of not just job-seekers but also of people who would be open to the right opportunity. That's valuable to corporate HR departments.In recent years LinkedIn has been investing to improve its mobile smartphone and tablet tools and provide more content, more articles and experts who write on topics that are relevant. That brings people to the site more frequently and with a higher level of engagement. And that translates into more advertising dollars for LinkedIn. There's not only a growing number of recruiters who subscribe to the platform. There's also growing advertising business. All of this has a long way to run.IBD: You began your current stake in Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL) in September. Why do you like this particular casino stock?Kamm: They're a leading casino operator in Macau and the Cotai Strip (in Macau), which is well known as a high-growth market, noticeably larger than Las Vegas. The subtle shift in the market in recent years is that the market is no longer driven primarily by high rollers, ultrahigh net worth individuals gaming in Macau. It is driven by the mass market today.Melco's properties are well positioned to serve the mass market. And that part of the market is more profitable than the high-net-worth part. Melco is working to open new properties, which will expand its earnings potential.Also, transportation to Macau is improving. And we're seeing changes that make it more attractive for destination travel, not just gambling demand.IBD: Your stake in Tractor Supply (TSCO) has edged up.Kamm: They're the leading supply store for recreational farms and the rural lifestyle. They have 1,300 stores today. We think they have potential for at least 2,100 stores. As they grow, they've done a good job of increasing productivity of existing stores. They've done a good job of understanding their business data.They've done a good job with e-commerce to leverage their brand outside their physical stores. They've done a good job of laying in private label goods within the store to provide different price points and help expand their own margins. All of those drivers have potential in the coming years.

3018,CMG,"""Did you ever get the feeling that the world is a tuxedo and you're a pair of brown shoes?""— George Gobel, comedianThere's no point zigging when the whole world is zagging. Buying stocks during a correction or a bear market is simply fighting the tape — a fight you lose. Similarly, shorting stocks while the market is rising also can be a waste of time and money.Sure, you could find the one stock that can buck the bear, or short a stock that falls amid a rising market. But the odds are stacked against you. Why would you want to make investing more difficult and less profitable than necessary?IBD research shows that one of the most important factors that determines a stock's success is the direction of the broad market. Bull markets don't lift all boats — but most.So how best to use your time during a correction? Look for great stocks, those that you can buy when the market turns up and that stock breaks out.Great stocks don't necessarily rise in a bear market — although some do. But many build bases while the broad market is getting shellacked.When the correction ends, you'll see a lot of stocks that are badly damaged — and a few that have held their losses and show the signs of at least some institutional accumulation.What kind of a stock will build a nice, tight base while the market is falling? The sort that's enjoying support from the big-money funds. They've identified the stock as a future winner, and they're taking advantage of the correction to get in at bargain prices.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) built a 10-week cup-with-handle in 2010. At the time, the S&P 500 was in a correction that would cost the index 17% at its worst.Chipotle's correction only ran as deep as 18% — not bad, considering that market leaders can show losses of as much as 2-1/2 times that of the index without being considered excessive.Chipotle broke out at 154.53 on Sept. 1 1, the same day that the broad averages scored a market follow-through. Not all winners break out on the follow-through, but those that break out early in the uptrend tend to often score the biggest gains. Chipotle's breakout heralded a gain that would amount to 186%.
"
3019,CMG,"The market continues to chug slowly upward, carrying a little momentum from the summer rally, and a few Big Cap 20 stocks are near secondary buy points.Secondary buy points can be pullbacks to the 10-week moving average or three weeks tight. They're not as reliable as primary buy points, such as a breakout on volume from a sound base. But secondary buy points can be used to add a small number of shares to a successful position.Actavis (ACT) moved upward out of a three-weeks-tight pattern Friday with a 166.42 buy point, but volume was only average. Investors should prefer to see heavy volume on the breakout, even from a secondary buy point. The stock held its own Monday.Actavis is 25% extended from a 133.10 buy point from a July 26 breakout from its flat base. Investors who bought there might consider locking in profits.Healthcare LeaderAnother medical stock, Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), completed a breakout from a flat base. Volume was 53% above average, but the stock closed in the lower half of its range, which isn't a sell signal but is a negative.Alexion has solid fundamentals, but has behaved erratically in the last few months. It broke out of an awkwardly shaped double bottom Oct. 25, fell back into the base, then found support at its 10-week moving average before forming the flat base.Alexion can be volatile. Its beta ratio is 1.45, meaning its daily moves are 45% wider than that of the S&P 500.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) also found support at its 10-week line. It's been a leading growth stock since going public in 2006. Earnings growth has slowed some in recent quarters, but the stock appears to be getting its second wind. Analysts expect earnings growth of 20% this year and 24% next year.The highly successful fast-casual dining chain has an Earnings Stability Factor of 9 on a 0 to 99 scale, where low numbers correspond to steady earnings growth.Chipotle has also ventured into Southeast Asian cuisine with a new chain of eateries called ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen.Aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts (PCP) broke out of a cup base Oct. 24, but has noodled around its buy point since then. In the process, it's formed a flat base with a 263.62 buy point. It could be classified as a base on base.Speaking of the aircraft industry, Northrop Grumman (NOC) appeared to be finding support at its 10-week line. But this would be the third pullback to the support line since the stock broke out of a base in March.Only the first two pullbacks should be considered safe, so investors need to weigh the higher odds of failure in buying at this level.

3022,CMG,"Several Big Cap 20 stocks appear to be setting up in bases, while the stock market tries to regain its footing after stumbling last week.Internet stocks are on the move and are currently ranked near the top of the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD. One of the better names in that group is LinkedIn (LNKD), which has been a major winner during 2013.LinkedIn has been basing for 14 weeks and has corrected 19%. It would be a third-stage base. It broke out of a first-stage base in January and a second-stage base in July.Third-stage bases are considered late in a stock's move and have a higher risk of failure. But that doesn't mean an investor can't succeed buying out of a third-stage base. Take the example of Priceline.com (PCLN), another Big Cap 20 stock. It's gained more than 50% after breaking out of a long fourth-stage base in May.LinkedIn's earnings grew 77% in the most recent quarter, and analysts are expecting an 11% increase in the current quarter, due to be reported in early February. Sales were up 56%.The company operates a popular online social networking platform where people can share their professional identities.The Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group has also had a good year, with members like Biogen Idec (BIIB) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) inhabiting the Big Cap 20. Alexion has built a six-week flat base, but it's been toying with investors.It feigned a breakout Dec. 9, but pulled back below a 126.49 buy point the same day. Its movements in recent months have been erratic, but it seems to have tightened up in recent weeks.Earnings in the most recent quarter rose 38% and analysts are forecasting a 40% gain in the current quarter. Return on equity is an impressive 27%. The company develops a variety of drugs.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is having its first pullback to its 50-day moving average since breaking out of a flat base in September.Chipotle was a big winner in the bull market beginning in March 2009, but took a siesta of more than a year to build a new base.It gapped up and closed 16% higher Oct. 18 after reporting earnings 17% above the year-ago quarter.Precision Castparts (PCP) broke out of a cup base Oct. 24 and has hung around a 254.24 buy point since then.At the same time, it's spent seven weeks carving out a flat base with a 263.62 buy point. The stock rose 4.29 to 257.40 Monday, but volume was missing in action.The company makes parts for the aircraft industry. It has three straight years of earnings increases. Earnings in the most recent quarter rose 28%. Analysts expect a 27% increase in the current quarter.

On Tuesday, Krispy Kreme announced it will open four new stores in Alaska over the next three years.Krispy Kreme hasn't set a date for its Q3 earnings release but the results could be out later this month based on the timing of its prior reports.Third-quarter EPS is seen rising 33% to 16 cents, and sales are expected to increase 10% to $117.67 million.Shares closed at 25.22 in the stock market today, up 28% since its earnings miss in August and more than recouping the dive that followed immediately afterward.Chipotle Mexican Grill, a burrito joint, also made the screen. The restaurant chain has done well with health and environmentally conscious consumers as it promotes its locally grown and organic ingredients. There is also speculation the chain may start offering breakfast.Chipotle was initiated on Friday with an outperform rating by RBC Capital Markets, which cited its ""high appeal to millennials"" and its accelerating sales and earnings momentum as reasons for the positive outlook.In October, Chipotle reported earnings below estimates, but its sales and traffic topped views, sending shares up 16% after the report. Shares have continued to rise, climbing 5% since Oct. 17.SouFun and BitAuto are two Chinese stocks that have been mainstays on the screen, helped by the flourishing consumer market in China.SouFun operates a Chinese real estate website. The stock hit a fresh closing high of 62.46 on Tuesday.On Friday, Citi raised its price target on the stock to 71.40 from 56.30 after SouFun boosted its full-year revenue outlook to $605 million-$615 million from $538 million-$548 million when it reported strong earnings results Thursday.SouFun said Q3 EPS jumped 69% to $1.15, topping estimates for 86 cents. Revenue grew 46% to $185.1 million, ahead of forecasts for $173.7 million.BitAuto, a Chinese Web-based auto marketer, also hit a new closing high of 28.21 on Tuesday after Oppenheimer raised its price target on the stock again, to 30 from 20.On Thursday, BitAuto reported a 45% jump in revenue to $61.8 million, topping estimates. EPS more than doubled to 32 cents per share, also beating views.MasterCard also makes the screen as more people are using plastic instead of cash. The card processing giant is even experimenting with cardless transactions with its MasterPass, which lets consumers purchase goods with a smartphone or tablet.Last month, the company announced that Canada's Beyond the Rack and Newegg, Britain's Currys and LastMinute.com, and PC World in the U.S. have joined the over 20,000 retailers in four countries that offer the MasterPass. MasterCard also said it's planning to expand MasterPass to seven more countries this quarter.On Oct. 31 the company said Q3 EPS rose 18% to $7.27 and revenue rose 16% to $2.22 billion.

3072,CMG,"It's a hard fact to face sometimes. Not all your swing trades are going to work. But cutting losses quickly keeps the damage of any individual trade at a minimum. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) provides an example. Taking action quickly avoided potential heartache down the road. For long-term performance, that gives you a greater chance at success.Investors had a strong reaction to Chipotle's earnings on April 26, pushing the stock up nearly 25% (1). What really stood out was the tight action over the next few weeks. The stock hardly gave up any gains. Plus, the declining volume suggested very few investors were selling.On May 16, Chipotle Mexican Grill cleared its consolidation as volume picked up (2). It joined IBD's SwingTrader on the positive action. Of course, the expectation was for continued gains. However, market weakness contributed to a pullback. The stock hadn't broken its support levels, so cutting it completely seemed unnecessary. But if it couldn't follow up on the strength, could this provide profits quickly?Reducing the position by half on May 18 acted as a compromise (3). If the weakness continued, the early sell reduces the overall loss. For swing trades, if the losses stay small, it allows the gains to compound and grow your portfolio. If the stock comes back, it can either be repurchased or at the very least turn the trade profitable. In this case, Chipotle Mexican Grill didn't really do either. It didn't see a decisive close below its 5-day moving average. But it couldn't seem to rise back above it. The 10-day moving average provided a level of support that seemed to hold. That is, until May 25 (4).Once Chipotle punctured its 10-day moving average, it was hard to justify holding any longer. Granted, the volume was minimal and the action continued to be tight. But if your stock can't make progress after holding it for more than a week, it's usually time to move on to the next swing trade. Even if the stock doesn't plummet, it may just require more time before it works. There's little reason to risk a downturn in the stock if it needs more time anyway. It's safer in cash, or even better, could be used for another prospect. The fact that the market was mostly sideways during the time made the decision that much easier.The average gain for IBD SwingTrader in 2018 is close to 5% in an average of seven days. Scaling out with the early sell kept the loss for the entire trade under 2%. The handling of Chipotle reduced the loss of money and time on a nonperforming stock.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Long-Term Stock Profits Mean Cutting Losses Quickly In Swing TradesWhich Moving Average Is Best For Profiting On Swing TradesSwing Trading Strategies And Lessons

3077,CMG,"Retailing, apparel, consumer-spending and semiconductor-related stocks dominated the market's upside in stocks today, as major indexes sought to beef up their morning gains. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), meanwhile, reaffirmed a new trend of emerging institutional demand within the restaurant industry group.Chipotle, which is a new trading idea in IBD SwingTrader on Wednesday, rallied more than 3% to 440.27 in healthy turnover for what figures to be its fourth up day in a row.Chipotle's volume is running 52% above usual levels, hinting that mutual funds, pensions, hedge funds, banks, insurers and the like are accumulating shares heavily.The stock ran in the short sellers on April 26 after reporting Q1 results that pointed to an ongoing turnaround in fundamentals. After that big jump, Chipotle traded tightly and volume dried up, forming a handle in the process. That positive action following the catapulting move in price in essence formed a handle and a 433.10 buy point within its new deep first-stage base.At 2:30 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite paced the key indexes with a gain of more than 0.7%. At 7405, the premier index of high-growth companies is now up 7.2% year to date. It advanced 28.2% last year.The Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) ETF rallied 1.2% to 35.25. The exchange-traded fund, managed by Innovator Capital, gained 34% in 2017.The S&P 500 rose 0.5%. A two-point drop by 3M (MMM) hampered the Dow Jones industrial average's advance. The blue chip index rose around 0.3%. Volume is running around 7%-8% lower vs. the same time Tuesday on both main exchanges.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use3M has been hit with heavy institutional selling ever since the Dow Jones industrial component and manufacturing giant cracked below the 50-day moving average in severe volume on Feb. 5, a key sell signal.Some sector indexes heated up even more.The PHLX Semiconductor index, also known as the SOX, winged 1.1% higher. Micron Technology (MU) broke out of a new double-bottom base at 54.37 in decent but not great turnover.Notice how in this nine-week double bottom, the middle peak of 54.27 is actually 10 cents beneath the midpoint of the actual base (45.31 low plus 63.42, giving a base midpoint of 54.37). You'd prefer to see the midpoint of a double bottom be firmly lodged within the upper half of the base.That said, Micron is still 11% below the base's 63.42 peak. In other words, it's possible for the stock to continue building the right side of the current base. Double-bottom bases can also form handles, which represent a final shakeout of uncommitted shareholders, and boost the chances of a successful breakout.Micron is a member of the strong data storage industry group. In that group, Smart Global (SGH) continues to act as a market leader as well. Shares, up nearly 4% to 47.33, are working on the right side of a potential cup pattern.Returning to the restaurant group, Wingstop (WING) and Shake Shack (SHAK) are showing robust action so far in 2018.The former has made a series of rebounds off the 50-day moving average after it cleared a 33.64 buy point in a 10-week flat base on Nov. 3, 2017. On that day, the chicken wing chain reported a 31% jump in earnings to 17 cents a share for the third quarter of 2017 as sales lifted 19% to $26 million.Since then, earnings have risen 13% and 19% in the prior two quarters. In IBD Stock Checkup, Wingstop ranks 5th within the Retail-Restaurants industry group with an 87 Composite Rating. That overall ranking belies a solid EPS Rating of 88 on a scale of 1 to 99, which means that the company's long- and short-term profit growth is superior to 88% of all publicly traded companies in IBD's database.Wingstop's Composite score is likely hurt by the fact that it doesn't have an SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + Return on equity) Rating. Why? Wingstop does not have a calculable return on equity. As of the first quarter of 2018, the Dallas-based company showed a total stockholders' deficit of $146 million. Nonetheless, Wingstop posts excellent operating cash flow that has been higher than annual earnings per share for four years in a row.The Street sees Wingstop's earnings rising 14% to 83 cents a share this year and 19% to 99 cents in 2019.Shake Shack powered past a 44.50 buy point in a four-month cup with handle on April 13, then blasted higher nearly two weeks later after the popular burger, crinkle cut fries, and shake chain posted a 50% bulge in adjusted Q1 profit and a 29% increase in sales to $99.1 million.Wingstop and Shake Shack are small cap firms with market values of $1.5 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively.In other markets, U.S. crude oil futures eased 0.3% to $71.08 a barrel. That decline didn't stop IBD 50 member Daqo New Energy (DQ) from rallying nearly 11% to 65.22 in hefty trade.The expert in making raw polysilicon for solar cell production is a wild stock, easily prone to swinging up or down 5% any given day. Nevertheless, the stock has now cleared a 65.09 entry point in a deep double bottom base and is in buy range.The 5% buy zone for Daqo goes up to 68.34.Daqo is No. 13 in the IBD 50.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond is holding firmly above the 3% threshold, currently at 3.08%.Fed funds future now show a roughly 54% chance that the Federal Reserve will make four quarter-point hikes in short-term interest rates by December this year.RELATED:How To Find The Correct Buy Point In Stocks: Maximize Your Return, Minimize Your RiskWhich Stocks Just Entered The IBD 50, Sector Leaders, And Other Key IBD Screens?

Revenue of $11.97 billion also beat consensus views, and user numbers met expectations. Premarket action suggested the stock could open back above its 10-week moving average.

Premarket moves do not always carry over into regular trade.Chip stocks gathered for a sharp early advance, with all 30 of the Philly Chip Index stocks trading flat to higher. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) led, up 10% in premarket trade. The chipmaker reported significant acceleration in earnings and revenue growth in its first-quarter results late Wednesday, and guidance pointed to further acceleration ahead.

The China-based chain of after school tutoring centers blew past analyst expectations with a 75% earnings gain and a 59% rise in revenue for its fiscal fourth quarter. The premarket move positioned shares to open back above a 36.26 buy point, but the stock comes with a long list of cautions. Among the most important, the base is very late stage, and the stock had pulled back more than 8% below the base's entry, tripping the automatic sell rule.On the downside, airline stocks were under early pressure. American Airlines (AAL) narrowed its early loss to 2.9% as lowered full-year earnings guidance diluted strong unit revenue growth and a narrow earnings beat for the first quarter.  Southwest Airlines (LUV) dumped 3.8% following mixed first-quarter results. The mood spilled over onto Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Airlines (UAL), but both had trimmed early losses to a bit more than 1% apiece.Treasury yields and oil prices could have some impact on how durable early gains might be across the span of Thursday's session. Early trade Thursday showed bonds rising a bit off Wednesday's settle price, sending the 10-year yield down 4 basis points to 2.99%. Crude oil prices climbed another 0.8%, putting U.S. benchmark crude near $69 a barrel and within 2% of last Thursday's 41-month high.March durable goods orders increased 2.6%, the Commerce Department said, down from February's 3.5% surge, but still well above the 1.7% gain expected by economists.

That was down from an already low 233,000 claims in the prior week, falling to what was reportedly the lowest level in 48 years, and undercutting economist views for a slight decrease to 230,000 new filings.RELATED:Nasdaq Jumps As Facebook, PayPal Climb; This Retailer Poised For Gap Up Open Dow Outperforms Thanks To Boeing; Nasdaq Recovers But Growth Stocks Hit HardApple Faces 'Gloom and Doom' Ahead Of EarningsWhy Winning Stocks Are Strong Price Performers Before Big Price MovesBitcoin, Other Cryptocurrencies Slide After Wall Provider HackedThese 4 Apparel Stocks Look Fashionable As They Outperform Market

McDonald's stock also sank in March after an analyst warned that the $1-$2-$3 Dollar Menu — the company's revamped menu for cheap eats — had gotten off to a ""tough start"" amid a swarm of discounts from rivals.Some restaurant operators, in a recently-published survey from Kalinowski Equity Research, also said the $1-$2-$3 Dollar Menu was ""confusing"" and lacked ""compelling items that anybody wants.""Others had more tempered optimism.""This price point, in light of labor costs and food & paper costs, will be hard for competitors to match long term,"" one franchisee said in the survey.

But Grubhub, the only publicly traded name among the three, has been rapidly consolidating smaller regional delivery plays since its launch in 2014.And it has some deep-pocket backing of its own. Yum Brands bought a $200 million piece of the Chicago-based company in February. Yum owns Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell. Last year, Grubhub paid $288 million for Yelp's Eat24.

Yum Brands (YUM), Taco Bell's parent, also said that Niccol was departing.Niccol, who's led Taco Bell since 2015, has been credited with turning around sales and speeding the introduction of technology at the chain.

3090,CMG,"At Taco Bell, Brian Niccol was seen as a turnaround artist of sorts. He was an early believer in mobile ordering. Nacho fries, Doritos Locos Tacos, Quesalupas and breakfast? All of them appeared on Taco Bell's menu on his watch.X But as he prepares to take the helm at Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) in March, leaving the Yum Brands (YUM) unit, a similar approach — possibly resulting in a more mobile Chipotle with more food choices and a better loyalty program — would raise new questions about the assembly-line format, pared-down menu and higher ingredient standards that once won it praise from Wall Street.Niccol's appointment, announced late Tuesday, has generally made analysts happy and taken a massive weight off its stock. Shares sprinted 15.4% higher to close at 289.91 in the stock market today. Chipotle stock has fallen for more than two years, hitting a five-year closing low Tuesday, following food-safety concerns and continuing disappointing sales.But restaurants' efforts to allow people to order via smartphone have occasionally chafed with the actual locations themselves. Starbucks (SBUX) has been trying to untie the knots of customer traffic that have formed at its locations due to the popularity of its mobile order and pay service. As delivery proliferates, others, like McDonald's (MCD), have had to tweak how they manage the flow of cars through their parking lots as they roll out mobile ordering and delivery.Ivan Feinseth, research director at Tigress Financial, said moving food-prep duties like cutting vegetables off-site could help Chipotle move customers through lines more quickly as digital orders grow. A new loyalty program, paired with a mobile app, could mean fewer cash payments — which slows down lines — from consumers willing to pay more, he said.""They don't reward their loyal customer base,"" he said. ""Taco Bell has a very robust loyalty and mobile ordering app.""Chipotle Mexican Grill has already introduced second-make lines, or lines that sit behind the main ordering stations, to handle digital orders. During its Q4 call, Chipotle said wait times have fallen on those lines. It plans to have second-make lines in at least 30% of its restaurants by the end of this year.Feinseth also called for the company to expand delivery and open for breakfast — something McDonald's doubled down on in 2015 to turn its sales around. He said Chipotle could easily do a breakfast burritos and bowls menu. Mexican-blend coffee, he said, along with plain coffee, wouldn't hurt either.Those changes would be possible, he said, without deviating from Chipotle's core menu. And he remains upbeat that people will respond to new additions.""While people do like simplicity and consistency, the quick-casual industry also drives traffic by change,"" he said.The fast-casual Mexican chain's new products, so far, have had mixed reception. People said the queso was too gritty. Others said its brand of chorizo, a combination of pork and chicken, was not chorizo-y enough.What's more, Chipotle is not Taco Bell. Cowen analyst Andrew Charles, in a research note, said that Chipotle's sales trends are in far worse shape than Taco Bell's were when Niccol joined that chain in 2011.""The guys at Chipotle tried a lot of things,"" said John Zolidis, president at Quo Vadis Capital. ""They didn't just sit there waiting for the customer to come back.""Zolidis said Chipotle's higher food standards — ""Food with Integrity"" and the like — may have also made it more difficult to bring in new menu items.""I don't think Taco Bell was holding itself to that same standard,"" he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Here's How McDonald's Will Invest $6 Billion In The U.S. Through 2020Restaurant Brands Doubles Payout: Dividend Yield Now Tops McDonald's, Wendy's

Management forecast a sequential revenue decline in the March quarter, with the mid-point of revenue guidance implying 37% growth to $459 million, just above estimates of $457 million.

It faces a slew of new entrants in a rapidly transforming auto sector, not least Alphabet (GOOGL) and its Waymo self-driving unit. Waymo — often seen as being furthest along on autonomous technology — said it will soon put passengers in driverless cars — without even a ""safety driver"" to take over the controls if things go wrong. But GM says its ability to both develop self-driving solutions and manufacture cars gives it an edge vs. tech rivals in the race to put self-driving cars on public roads on a commercial scale.

3097,CMG,"XInvestors brushed off concerns of a slowdown in consumer prices and most key indexes gained on Monday. But the Dow Jones industrial average edged 0.1% lower on the back of 1-point drops or more by at least 4 of the Dow industrials' 30 components.The Nasdaq composite led the rally, rising 0.7% for the day, while the S&P 500 rose nearly 0.2%. Volume fell on both main exchanges, according to preliminary data.The Dow Jones transports slipped 0.3%.Last week, the S&P 500 large-cap benchmark rallied 1.5%, on top of a nearly 0.9% lift in the prior week. The Nasdaq had risen more than 4% over the prior two weeks, a clear signal that money continued to flow in the technology sector.In a heavy day for economic data, even bond investors didn't seem overly concerned about a surprise 0.1% dip in the March PCE prices gauge, excluding volatile energy and food prices, the first month-on-month drop since September 2001, according to Reuters. Plus, in the 12 months through March, the PCE index was up just 1.6%, vs. up 1.8% through February.The Federal Reserve has made it widely known that it wants to see inflation hitting at least 2% before taking more steps at reducing liquidity from the banking system. On Monday, meanwhile, investors sold U.S. government bonds hard; the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond inched up to 2.32%. The spread between the 2- and 10-year yields have slimmed a tad over the past 30 days.The interest-rate-sensitive Dow Jones utility average fell nearly 0.7%.Back to equities, looking at IBD's rankings of 197 industry groups, four of the top 10 groups come from the telecom and tech sectors (wireless services, semiconductor equipment, computer networking and computer data storage).Other top groups within the top 20 included the gaming group, which has vaulted from No. 80 to No. 13 over the past six weeks. Restaurants have jumped from No. 82 to No. 17 over the same time frame, while the lodging group has risen from No. 70 to No. 14.Among the four tech groups mentioned above, these names have stood out.Brooks Automation (BRKS) was up more than 5%, to 26.76, in heavy volume. The expert in automation and cryogenic systems for chipmakers and life sciences companies is extended sharply after a successful rebound off the 10-week moving average, near 16.90, in late January.Brooks also has been highlighted in the IBD Stock Spotlight.Western Digital (WDC) was down 1% to 87.97. The stock probed 52-week highs on Friday and has overall done well since it burst past an 81.77 flat-base buy point March 30. The stock is up almost 30% year to date, and harbors an A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating from IBD Stock Checkup. Watch to see if Western Digital, thriving after its acquisition of SanDisk, eases back within the 5% buy zone from the 81.77 entry, or up to 85.85. At the moment, it is too far up from the buy point to be considered for purchase.Western gets a superb 99 Composite, the maximum allowed, from IBD Stock Checkup, as well as an A for SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + Return on equity) Rating on a scale of A to E.Lam Research (LRCX) was up nearly 3% to a new high of 148.85. Shares are extended and it could be weeks before another entry develops. EPS growth in Q1 accelerated to 137%, up from gains of 20%, 0% and 43% in the prior three quarters, as sales rose 64%.Lam has been a fixture on the IBD Big Cap 20 (see the Stock Lists section on Investors.com) for several months, and currently ranks in the top 10 within the IBD 50.Other chip equipment names with outstanding Composite Ratings and excellent stock price action include ASML Holding (ASML) (broke out past an 110.24 early entry in late December, 2nd test of the 10-week moving average), and Applied Materials (AMAT), part of IBD Big Cap 20.Also in the group, Cabot Microelectronics (CCMP) is trading at new highs. But its recent pullback has produced a faulty cup base that falls short of the six-week minimum. Notice on a weekly chart how Cabot has gone two weeks down, then two weeks up into new high ground.At the same time, the 9.3% drop within the narrow consolidation was perhaps not enough to justify the V-shape-like action as an outright sell signal.Cabot faces a tough comp in fiscal Q3 earnings as profit grew 103% in the year-ago quarter that ended in June. Q3 profit this year is seen rising 5% to 83 cents a share.Among the fast-rising nontechnology groups:Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) was up more than 1% to 479.29 as it made a rebound off Monday's session low. The stock has climbed sharply in recent weeks, and last week the taco-and-burrito chain marked a solid Q1 rebound in profit ($1.60 a share on an adjusted basis) and revenue ($1.07 billion, up 28%, the largest gain in 10 quarters).The strong top-line result indicated that Chipotle is winning back trust among its customers. In Q1, the Denver-based firm, with founder Steve Ells now back as sole CEO, added 57 new shops while closing 15 ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen restaurants and one Chipotle restaurant. Total restaurant count on March 31 reached 2,291.Operating margin at the restaurant level jumped to 17.7% from 6.8%, but that's still off from the 20% to 30% levels seen in prior years.Chipotle arguably broke out of a first-stage bottoming-base pattern at 434.79 at the end of March and also is extended.The Denver-based fast-casual dining pioneer sports a decent 77 RS Rating; other high-quality companies in IBD's Retail-Restaurants group with even better RS Ratings are Dave & Buster's (PLAY) at 83; Restaurant Brands (QSR) at 84; and Yum China (YUMC) at 87. Yum China, a spinoff from the KFC and Pizza Hut giant Yum Brands (YUM), has rallied 17% past a 29.45 aggressive entry within a four-month IPO base.Shares went public on Nov. 1 and ended their first trading session on the NYSE at 26.19.The Street expects earnings to grow 17% this year to $1.41 a share and 11% the next.RELATED:Stock Spotlight: The Secret Ingredient Behind These 5 Stocks' Big Moves UpHow To Invest: The Latest From IBD's Investor's CornerWhen Will Commodities Rebound?

3098,CMG,"XDomino's Pizza (DPZ) is testing GPS-tracking technology and expects to retain drivers as a broad swath of restaurant chains — from fast-food icon McDonald's (MCD) to fast-casual favorite Panera Bread (PNRA) — explore or ramp up delivery.Just this week, McDonald's said it is expanding its delivery partnership with Uber and will launch home delivery in the U.K. in June. Panera, which is being bought by JAB Holding, said it will hire 10,000 new employees, with about three-quarters of them being delivery drivers.Addressing the growing demand for drivers, Domino's CEO Patrick Doyle said during a conference call with analysts that the company's drivers will be ""more consistently busy and receiving tips at Domino's than working somewhere else.""Shares of Domino's were up 2.5% to 185.55 on the stock market today, retaking their 50-day average on strong quarterly results, but off session highs of 188.85.Rival Papa John's (PZZA), which reports Tuesday, edged up 0.45%, and McDonald's added 3 cents.Domino's Q1 EPS jumped 42% to $1.26, beating Wall Street forecasts by 10 cents, as sales climbed 16% to $624.2 million, above views for $615.85 million. Same-store sales leapt 10.2%.The results come after Domino's stock lost 5.8% on April 7 on a report from M Science that forecast that U.S. first-quarter sales gains would come in ""well below the rough consensus estimate,"" according to CNBC.Instinet analyst Mark Kalinowski, in a research note before Domino's earnings, had also expressed caution about Domino's sales. He cited what he said appeared to be ""rather robust"" discounting at Yum Brands' (YUM) Pizza Hut last month, when the NCAA basketball tournament took place. Slower sales in the U.K. and Australia were also concerns.As other fast-food restaurants fought each other on discounts and cheaper groceries discourage eating out, Domino's last year largely remained above the fray, putting up solid sales and EPS figures.Customers are already used to ordering pizza over the phone, so Domino's mobile ordering platform has worked particularly well as other restaurants try to digitize ordering and the experience inside their locations.RELATED:McDonald's Delivers Beefy Earnings; Execs Talk Deliveries, Digital StoresDomino's CEO Doyle On Netflix, Trump And Pizza's 'Jetsons' Future

3099,CMG,"XAfter two days of strong gains, the stock market took a more reserved approach early Wednesday as it advanced with modest gains. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average moved up 0.1% each, while the Nasdaq inched slightly lower. More details about President Trump's tax-cut plan are expected this afternoon. Among the Dow industrials, Travelers (TRV)and United Technologies (UTX) rose 1.2% and 1.5%, respectively, in the stock market today.

P&G missed its top-line estimates in its Q3 release, causing the stock to fall even further below its 50-day line.Boeing reported mixed Q1 results early Wednesday that saw revenue missing its target. Shares of the airplane maker are extended from a 160.17 flat-base entry, but are forming a new flat base with a potential 185.81 entry. Chipotle (CMG) continued its recent string of gains after exceeding the Street's Q1 earnings and revenue targets. The burrito maker traded 1.8% higher on Wednesday and shares are about 12% above a 434.79 flat-base buy point.Disk drive maker Seagate Technologies (STX) plunged over 14%, triggering a sell signal, after missing revenue estimates early Wednesday. The stock broke out of a cup with handle with a 49.57 entry on Monday. Competitor Western Digital (WDC) dropped 2.9%, but remains about 3% above an 81.77 flat-base entry.U.S. Steel's (X) surprise Q1 loss late Tuesday caused its shares to plummet more than 25%, creating a brief ripple effect throughout the industry. Fellow steelmakers Nucor (NUE) and Steel Dynamics (STLD) fell in unison in early trading, but recovered to move slightly higher. Earnings releases were not particularly kind to leading growth stocks on Wednesday. Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), Evercore Partners (EVR), PRA Health Sciences (PRAH), and Mercury Systems (MRCY) all fell after their quarterly earnings reports.Macom dropped 6.7%, triggering the 8%-loss-cutting sell signal from a 52.32 cup-with-handle entry. Shares had been down as much as 14% before paring losses. Evercore and PRA Health Sciences dropped 4% each. Evercore pierced the 50-day on heavy volume, while PRA Health was testing its 50-day line. Mercury fell 2%, but had recovered from the worst of its losses.On the upside, financial names Financial Engines (FNGN) and Leaderboard name Essent Group (ESNT) moved up more than 2% in quiet volume. The latter is in buy range from a 38.20 flat-base entry.RELATED:Boeing Misses Q1 Revenue View But Cash Flow More Than TriplesSeagate Plunges On Revenue Miss; Western Digital Shares Also FallChipotle, Wynn, Arconic Beat; Stryker, Illumina Guide Q2 Profit LowWhere Is The Stock Market Headed?

3102,CMG,"As more states legalize pot, video games become more amazing, Netflix (NFLX) spends billions on new programming and GrubHub (GRUB) makes ordering out easier than ever, Jack in the Box (JACK) on Tuesday wrestled with a question that could become more crucial to fast-food chains: Can burgers and fries be delivered and still taste good and fresh?The answer, so far, appears to be: Maybe. Probably?Speaking at this year's ICR Conference, management at the burger chain said that it was too early to discuss specific results from a late-night delivery partnership it recently struck with GrubHub rival DoorDash in California. However, the company indicated that a lot of diners not only like their burgers and fries delivered after 11 p.m., they don't necessarily mind if the food loses a little something during its journey to their doorsteps.""Consumers are actually more forgiving when they're ordering burgers and fries at that time of night,"" management said during the presentation.Pizza, by contrast, has long been a delivery item and holds up relatively well. Domino's Pizza (DPZ), which took the lead on mobile ordering, has benefited as people order in.Consumers' growing interest in delivery comes as Jack in the Box has worked over the past year to improve the quality and consumer perception of its core — burgers, fries and soda — which an outside researcher the company hired said was ""really suffering.""""We're a burger player, but still our best-selling product is tacos,"" CEO Lenny Comma said during the presentation. ""So we're a little bit weird in that way.""Many felt Jack in the Box's burgers weren't juicy, that the fries weren't consistently delivered and that the drinks were watered down, the company said. The company said it had changed ingredients for the burgers, tweaked the salting and heating of the fries, added Coca-Cola (KO) Freestyle machines and adjusted the syrup-to-carbonated-water ratio in the soda.Jack in the Box's tacos, beguilingly, have apparently needed no improvement. Some 554 million Jack in the Box tacos, which have been described as ""a wet envelope of cat food"" in the Wall Street Journal, are sold each year.IBD'S TAKE: Jack in the Box isn't the only restaurant chain trying to figure out what new delivery options mean for its business. Domino's Pizza CEO Patrick Doyle said the pizza chain was also closely watching services like GrubHub and Uber Eats. After a year focusing on better ingredients, the company said it would focus on new products this year. As bigger rivals compete more easily on value, Jack in the Box said its sales growth has come from its limited-time offerings and breakfast and late-night items, rather than from discounting.Jack in the Box and DoorDash announced their late-night delivery partnership in October. Under that partnership, food can be delivered as late as 3 a.m.""Unlike the daytime hours and the responsibilities that come with them, we believe that late night should be reserved for doing the things our guests enjoy the most,"" Iwona Alter, Jack in the Box's vice president of marketing, said then. ""Whether you're binge-watching your favorite show or gaming with friends, there's no need to stop the fun just because you're hungry!""Shares of Jack in the Box closed up 2% at 109.99 on the stock market today, and the stock continues to be one of the restaurant industry's stronger performers. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), which also presented at ICR, jumped 4.9% on strengthening same-store sales trends. Dave & Buster's (PLAY), another ICR presenter today, edged up 0.1%.

Trump also returned to attacking the costly Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jet, saying he'll save billions of dollars as he pushes more competition. Lockheed, which has said that it is reducing per-jet costs after years of overruns and delays, said that it's promised to ""aggressively"" reduce F-35 expenses.

3105,CMG,"Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants (DRI) reported fiscal second-quarter earnings that were in line with analyst forecasts, while revenue just missed.Estimates: EPS up 18.5% to 64 cents on a 2.5% revenue gain to $1.648 billion.Results: EPS of 64 cents, revenue from continuing operations edged up to $1.643 billion. Same-store sales rose 1.7%, but 2.6% at its Olive Garden locations. Olive Garden revenue rose 2.5% to $915 million, above some estimates.Outlook: Darden Restaurants still expects full-year EPS of $3.87-$3.97 with same-store sales growth of 1%-2%. Analysts forecast $3.93.Stock: Shares rose 0.1% to 75.73 in the stock market today. Darden stock edged up Monday but had been pulling back following its postelection climb from a cup base to an all-time high on Dec. 9.IBD'S TAKE: Darden Restaurants has tried to draw more customers by offering a better dining experience, and analysts see potential in its to-go offerings and digital platform. Meanwhile, Domino's Pizza is keeping an eye on the potential for drones and self-driving cars. McDonald's (MCD) rose 0.3%. Chipotle Mexican Grill (MCD) just dipped while Restaurant Brands International (QSR), which operates Burger King and doughnut shop Tim Hortons, edged up 0.1%.As for top-performing restaurant stocks, Domino's Pizza (DPZ) fell 0.1%, Dave & Buster's (PLAY) rose 0.25% while Wingstop (WING) climbed 0.5%.A broad swath of restaurant stocks suffered earlier this year amid food deflation, tougher competition, consumer anxieties and uncertainty from global affairs.But the election lifted restaurant shares amid expectations of an income tax cut, a hefty infrastructure spending bill and the easing of labor and healthcare regulations that affect the industry.Meanwhile, continued economic growth has tightened the job market, forcing income gains to finally pick up.RELATED:Darden Earnings Top But Restaurant Slump ContinuesChipotle Names Four New Directors In Nod To Investor Ackman
"
3106,CMG,"Facing criticism that it was slow to respond to an E. coli outbreak last year, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), on Friday announced four new directors to its board in a long-anticipated shake-up supported by activist investor Bill Ackman.The new members — Paul Cappuccio, Robin Hickenlooper, Ali Namvar and Matthew Paull — actually joined the board on Wednesday. The move brings the current number of directors to 12, the burrito chain said in a statement Friday.""Chipotle has taken the important step of refreshing its board, which will position the company for continued growth and long-term success,"" Ackman said in the statement.The overhaul addresses concerns that Chipotle's board was too insular and lacked diversity. The changes also add restaurant-industry experience in the form of Paull, previously chief financial officer of McDonald's (MCD). Following a series of foodborne-illness outbreaks last year, Chipotle drew flak for lacking the operational expertise of larger fast-food chains.The revamped board ""gives us the oversight, accountability and leadership we need,"" Chief Executive Steve Ells said in the statement.Namvar is an executive at Ackman's firm, Pershing Square Capital Management, Chipotle's largest investor. He joined Pershing Square in 2006 and helped oversee its investments in McDonald's, Wendy's International (WEN) and other food companies. Paull, who previously served on Chipotle's board when the company was owned by McDonald's, is also on the advisory board at Pershing Square.Pershing Square disclosed a stake of almost 10% in Chipotle in September. If the holdings fall below 5%, Namvar will resign from the restaurant chain's board, Pershing Square said in a separate filing Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Chipotle shares are well off their peak of 758.61, reached just as disclosures over E coli outbreaks hit the restaurant chain, and now are below 400 a share. It's now ranked 48th among those in IBD's restaurant stocks group, with Jack In The Box (JACK) at the top of the list. Hickenlooper, meanwhile, is a former investment banker at Thomas Weisel Partners who serves in senior executive roles at both Liberty Global (LBTYA) and Liberty Media (LMCA) — two pieces of billionaire John Malone's cable and media empire. She married Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, earlier this year.Cappuccio, a former U.S. Supreme Court clerk and associate deputy attorney general at the Department of Justice, rounds out the new additions. He has been general counsel at Time Warner (TWX) since 2001.The stock was up 2.1% in recent action. It had been down 20% this year through Thursday's close, hurt by Chipotle's food-safety crisis. The chain suffered a series of foodborne-illness outbreaks in 2015 and then struggled to repair its image, bringing massive sales declines.The reshuffle follows a CEO change on Monday, when Ells retook the role on a solo basis. He had served as co-leader with Monty Moran, but the board felt the arrangement made the chain harder to operate. Ells started the Denver-based company more than 23 years ago and ran it until 2009, when he assumed the shared role with Moran.Paull's involvement, meanwhile, extends a complicated relationship with McDonald's. Chipotle was a subsidiary of the burger giant before holding an initial public offering in 2006.Since then, Chipotle's executives have railed against traditional fast food and the burrito company has taken pains to distance itself from its former owner. Now, as Chipotle struggles with restaurant operations and new food-safety protocols, it's seeking advice from a veteran of the world's largest fast-food chain.Now, the question is how much difference the board changes will make, said Michael Halen, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. It's a positive sign that Pershing and Chipotle are working together constructively, but the new board members alone aren't enough to jump-start the troubled chain's recovery, he said.""It's really about people trusting the brand again, and ultimately that's going to take time,"" he said.

3107,CMG,"Blockchain, the shared record-keeping technology behind bitcoin, is creating links to more industries and could upend entire sectors of the economy by eliminating middlemen who currently thrive as brokers of money, products, services and information.Banks have been racing to adopt the technology — by one estimate, investment management firms could realize up to $16 billion in savings over the next five years. But it has the potential to overhaul everything from purchasing a home to buying groceries. Proponents even see people booking rides and lodging directly with blockchain, instead of going through Uber, Lyft or Airbnb.IBM's (IBM) blockchain technology is already being tested to track where high-end goods like diamonds and fine art are coming from to address theft and counterfeiting. And Wal-Mart (WMT) is using blockchain to trace some food items, potentially allowing the retail giant to respond more quickly to food-safety issues like the kind that hit Chipotle (CMG) last year.The potential power of the technology lies in its speed and transparency, analysts say. The need for companies that oversee transactions, shipments and supply chains could be greatly reduced or eliminated, in theory. Working off the same ledger, often called a distributed ledger, everyone sees the same thing.""That means that you have that single version of the truth, basically,"" IDC analyst James Wester said. ""You have that single version of what everybody is looking at.""Still, analysts caution that blockchain is new and largely untested. And if some of the applications seem a bit lofty, that might be because they are. Meanwhile, an entrenched army of lawyers, middlemen and regulators look to push back against blockchain's encroachment into everyday transactions.As opposed to passing documents from person to person or using a database that only allows one person to edit at a time, blockchain works a bit more like Google Docs, William Mougayar, who authored a book on blockchain, said in a blog post in September.Transactions are recorded on a ledger, which is shared among the participants, and sealed in a cryptographic block of code. That block of code links, like a chain, to the next block of code. The information stored can't be modified without changing everything else.Today when you pay for something at the grocery store with your credit card, your request to buy something goes from the store to a payment processor, which checks with the bank that issued your card to make sure you can buy the thing you want to buy. Blockchain, while unlikely to dislodge the ubiquitous Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA), could remove layers from that process.A 2008 paper often seen as the basis for bitcoin outlined the idea that online payments need not rely on such third parties that earn profits and take up time clearing purchases, and instead proposed a system that operates ""without relying on trust.""The problem? ""Digital goods, theoretically, are infinite. You can copy and paste them forever,"" Lex Sokolin, global director of financial tech strategy at Autonomous Research, told IBD. ""How do you actually trace that something exists? Blockchain is the solution to that question of how you make something that's digital actually scarce and identifiable.""By giving every participant access to a universal record book via a blockchain network, bitcoin helps keep transactions honest.But that network doesn't have to be so public, despite bitcoin's roots in cyberpunk decentralization, and the financial world has realized it doesn't have to use bitcoin.A blockchain network can be open to, say, only a few companies, or within a company. A variety of startups — ConsenSys, Chain and Alphabet (GOOGL)-backed Ripple — have developed their own blockchain-based technology to facilitate cross-border payments, accounting, asset tracking, and trading.Banks, seeing either a huge threat or opportunity, want in. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) has said it plans to develop blockchain technology, while Bank of America (BAC) in September announced a collaboration with Microsoft (MSFT) to develop and test such a network. More than 50 of the world's biggest financial firms have joined a consortium headed by the company R3, which helps its partners research and develop potential blockchain technology.Visa is also experimenting with blockchain to make cross-border transfers easier. Deutsche Bank (DB), UBS (UBS) and others are creating a blockchain-based currency to speed the clearance of securities trades. The central banks of the United Kingdom and China have mulled the adoption of using a shared ledger for digital currency transfers.The finance industry's rush to blockchain comes as high-frequency-trading firms have boiled that process down to a fragment of a second. But there is still a one- to three-day lag time between when a trade takes place and when it is actually settled, intended in part to ensure that all participants agree that a trade took place as desired.""Lots of reconcilement, lots of confusion,"" said Grainne McNamara, principal in capital markets, advisory, at PwC. ""Lots of issues between various banks keeping their own records of that and then reconciling back out to a custodian or an agent or to the market.""And that requires extensive back-office, human grunt work — and costs. Autonomous Research estimates that investment management firms could save about $16 billion by 2021 through blockchain.That same foundation for settling trades can be used not just for trading, but for any transaction that requires a third party to clear it. The list of possible uses seems to grow by the day:South Carolina Republican Rep. Mick Mulvaney, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for budget director, and Democratic Rep. Jared Polis of Colorado announced the formation of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus this year to educate Congress on the technology and how to best create policy around it. In September, Mulvaney said blockchain ""has the potential to revolutionize the financial services industry, the U.S. economy, and the delivery of government services.""But Gartner analyst Ray Valdes believes supply-chain management ultimately represents a bigger opportunity for blockchain than finance once the startup boom and bust settles.""In today's world, there are very real problems, in some cases life-or-death problems, involving counterfeit medicine, counterfeit foodstuffs like baby formula, counterfeit auto parts (like brake parts), counterfeit industrial components,"" he told IBD. ""There's an opportunity for blockchain as a shared authoritative record, a distributed ledger, that can unify not just payments but shipments.""Such applications could also help countries that are developing or struggling with corruption draw new investment.""You need to have a track record that creates trust by foreign investors in your country,"" Sokolin said. ""There are plenty of countries in the world that do not have that, that do not have a strong court system where there's corruption, a demonstrated record of countries seizing assets, things like that.""Consumers and investors may still have to wait several years for blockchain to make their lives easier or less costly. In the meantime, its critics will point out holes in the technology and the legal restrictions it faces. A labyrinth of laws, for example, governs the escrow process and is unlikely to be tossed out anytime soon.And as the broader financial-tech industry comes under greater regulatory scrutiny, IDC's Wester says the growth of smart contracts could run up against the middlemen that interpret agreements today.""There are a lot of things that those third parties actually do — and third parties in a contract would be attorneys, or basically the courts,"" Wester said. ""And what they're supposed to do is also not just provide a backstop for risk, but actually provide information on what's the best way to do things, look for potential issues, understand what might be problems, what might be illegal in the case of a contract or unethical or immoral or open you up for additional risk.""On Gartner's 2016 Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies, a curve on a graph that measures just that, blockchain sits close to what the firm calls the Peak of Inflated Expectations, right between smart robots and the connected home.From the peak, the curve shows blockchain and other technologies nose-diving into the Trough of Disillusionment, rebounding into the Slope of Enlightenment and, finally, settling into the Plateau of Productivity.The technology, Gartner estimates, has another five to 10 years before it becomes mainstream. That means several more years of blockchain being offered up as a replacement to technologies that actually still work pretty well — despite the urgings of newly converted CEOs.""Basically, the CEO goes on a trip, or to a conference, reads in an airline magazine or a business press article or trade press article that blockchain is the next big thing,"" Valdes said.""They come back to the office, they call in the CIO and say, 'Everyone's saying blockchain is the next big thing — are we working on blockchain?' And if that's your boss asking that question, you have one answer, which is 'Yes, we're doing it.' ""

3108,CMG,"Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) says its foray into burgers is going well.Its new offshoot restaurant called Tasty Made, which opened in Lancaster, Ohio, on Oct. 27, is seeing ""strong"" sales, according to spokesman Chris Arnold. Breaking from Chipotle's focus on burritos, Tasty Made offers a limited menu of burgers, french fries, soda and milkshakes. It's also selling a smoky bacon sauce.""Tasty Made is off to a very good start,"" said Arnold, giving an early update on the closely watched move. ""The food has been great, and the feedback we've received thus far has been largely positive.""Tasty Made, which is touting responsibly raised beef, could be a bright spot for a company still reeling from a food-safety crisis. Since foodborne illnesses sickened hundreds of customers across the U.S. last year, Chipotle has had to ratchet up marketing and offer free food in a bid to get people back in the door.For now, its comeback has proved elusive. Third-quarter same-store sales plunged 21.9%, worse than what analysts expected.Activist shareholder Bill Ackman took a stake in the beleaguered company this year, becoming Chipotle's second-biggest investor. Ackman said this week that his relationship with the burrito chain is ""extremely constructive,"" but the billionaire hasn't laid out a strategy for the company.As it expands into burgers, Chipotle is winding down an earlier effort. The company said last month that it was abandoning growth efforts for its Asian-food spinoff restaurant, ShopHouse, and would pursue strategic alternatives for the chain. Chipotle also owns a stake in Pizzeria Locale.Tasty Made's Yelp reviews are mixed, though they've been improving over the past two weeks. It is currently approaching a three-star rating, out of five.""There have been some criticisms,"" said Arnold, who declined to give specific sales figures for Tasty Made. ""But on the whole, we are hearing very good things.""

3109,CMG,"McDonald's (MCD) will launch table service nationwide, while introducing mobile ordering and expanding digital kiosks beginning next year, the burger chain said on Thursday.Those plans  are part of McDonald's efforts to become a ""modern, progressive burger company,"" executives told reporters in New York.They would also appear to be in keeping with the company's apparent intent, announced earlier this year, to find a way for staff and technology to coexist — at least for now — even as labor costs rise industrywide.McDonald's currently offers table service at some 500 locations, and jobs will be added for the table service and kiosk assistance, Bloomberg said Thursday. Reuters reported that mobile ordering will be introduced in the U.S. and 10 ""major markets"" next year.IBD'S TAKE: President-elect Donald Trump has put restaurant stocks back on the menu, with Jack In The Box and Dave & Buster's near buy points, joining Darden Restaurants and Papa John's.Technology has increasingly become a part of the dining experience for younger restaurant consumers. Some of those customers have turned away from McDonald's to eat at a growing list so-called better-burger chains — Shake Shack (SHAK), Habit Restaurants (HABT), Five Guys, In-N-Out — that emphasize quality over value and have made it more difficult for McDonald's to balance the two. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) itself opened its first Tasty Burger location late last month.More restaurants have also eyed technology as a way to compensate for higher wages. Wendy's (WEN) this year said it would make self-ordering kiosks available in its restaurants to offset costs.Meanwhile, digital ordering platforms have helped to make Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Papa John's (PZZA) outliers in a struggling restaurant sector.Earlier this month, McDonald's also said it was planning a ""very significant acceleration"" in spending on technology, according to Bloomberg.And earlier this year, CEO Steve Easterbrook said that technology like self-ordering kiosks was not ""meant as a labor replacement"" and was unlikely to result in job cuts.""It may change the nature of the jobs in the restaurant, because frankly technology is something that our customers are embracing, whether it's through their phone or whether through self-order kiosks — that is a societal trend,"" he said in May.""We want to adapt to that, but it's not actually meant as a labor replacement. We can just reapportion that labor into more service-orientated roles.""Restaurants in recent months have also struggled to grow sales amid consumers' election-related anxieties, and cheaper groceries have given diners more incentive to eat at home.And McDonald's, which reported strong quarterly results last month, is also approaching some tough comparisons from a year ago, when its launch of All Day Breakfast helped revive lagging sales growth. However, some analysts this year have expressed concern that McDonald's had depended a bit too much on All Day Breakfast to drive sales.McDonald's shares rose 0.2% to 119.45 in the stock market today. Wendy's rose 1.3%, while Shake Shack climbed 0.4%. Habit fell 0.2%, while Chipotle closed flat.RELATED:Big Mac Attacks: McDonald's Plots Its Next Strike In Burger WarsDomino's Earnings Sends Shares Higher, As CEO Sees Industry Mergers

3110,CMG,"For much of the summer and fall, pizza stocks seemed to be the only restaurant stocks performing well, with Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Papa John's (PZZA) hitting a series of all-time highs. But since the election, several other restaurant operators have soared.Dave & Buster's (PLAY), Jack in the Box (JACK) and Bojangles (BOJA) are in buy range.Meanwhile, Wingstop (WING), Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD), Cracker Barrel (CBRL) and Panera Bread (PNRA) are all closing in on sound entry points.Among restaurant giants, Yum Brands (YUM), parent of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut, is consolidating well. Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) is approaching a buy point. But McDonald's (MCD), Starbucks (SBUX) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) have a lot of work to do.Here's a look at some of the restaurant stocks:Dave & Buster's combines a traditional sports bar with big-screen TVs, with a huge number of video games for kids and adults.Dave & Buster's cleared a 46.94 buy point above a handle in a double-bottom base on Nov. 23, the day before Thanksgiving, but in light volume. Shares rose 0.2% to 47.42 on the stock market today.Jack in the Box operates the eponymous burger chain as well as Qdoba Mexican Eats, a rival to Chipotle.On Nov. 21, Jack in the Box reported strong profit growth but sales and guidance were light. But after a brief tumble, shares soared the following day, busting past a 102.78 buy point and hitting a record high. Since then, shares have traded near the high end of its buy range, pulling back 2.5% to 104.95 Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Restaurant stocks rallied on the election results on hopes that a Trump administration would have a lighter regulatory touch on eateries, on ObamaCare, franchisee rules and overtime pay. A federal judge last week blocked Pres. Obama's overtime rule, set to launch Dec. 1. Here's how the overtime ruling affects fast food chains and other retailers.Bojangles is a Southern-inspired chicken-and-biscuit chain.Bojangles came public at 19 a share in May 2015, hitting a record 28.45 a few days after its debut. Shares then largely retreated through 2015, then moved sideways for most of 2016. But Bojangles has surged since its Nov. 3 earnings report. Shares cleared a 19.10 buy point on Nov. 22 and closed Friday at 20.05, at the very tip of the 5% chase zone.Bojangles fell 1.75% to 19.70 Monday.Yum Brands operates the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell chains. It just spun off its Chinese operations into a separately traded public company, Yum China (YUMC).Yum Brands has been consolidating in a flat base going back to early September with a potential 66.39 buy point. Yum retook its 50-day moving average last week, edging down 0.4% to 63.11 Monday, finding some support at the 50-day.The fast casual bakery/cafe ran up after the election. The stock has a potential buy point of 224.24, but could be starting to form a handle that would likely offer a lower entry. A pause before a breakout might be constructive after its rapid run-up.Panera Bread slid 2.3% to 212.19 Monday after Wedbush Securities downgraded the stock to neutral, keeping a 220 price target.RELATED:Analysts Find Restaurant Stocks UnappetizingThe country style restaurant chain reported stronger-than-expected earnings on Nov. 22, though sales missed slightly.

3111,CMG,"It was a huge week for earnings. Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) were A-list headliners, but a slew of industrials, medicals, restaurants and more also reported. Tesla Motors (TSLA) reported a surprise profit, while Qualcomm (QCOM) will buy NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).The Nasdaq fell 1.3% for the week, with Amazon's miss and Apple's modest beat failing to impress. The tech-heavy index dropped below its 50-day line after retaking that level last week. The S&P 500 sank 0.7%, while the Dow rose 0.1%. Bonds continued to fall around the world, pushing the 10-year Treasury yield to multimonth highs.In the September quarter, Apple earned $1.67 a share, down 15% year over year, on sales of $46.85 billion, down 9%. Analysts expected Apple to earn $1.66 a share on sales of $46.94 billion. For the holiday quarter, Apple guided Wall Street higher on revenue, but its profit margin outlook came up short. Apple also unveiled new MacBook Pro notebook computers, which feature a touch-screen strip for application commands and shortcuts that replaces the function keys. Apple fell 2.5% for the week, but remains above its 50-day line.Amazon reported Q3 earnings of 52 cents a share, a big gain but well short of estimates for 78 cents. The e-commerce giant plowed money into its Amazon Web Services cloud computing unit, along with a big expansion of fulfillment centers heading into the holiday season. Revenue rose 29% to $32.7 billion, meeting views. AWS was among the bright spots in the earnings report as revenue rose 55% year over year to $3.23 billion, beating the consensus.

Amazon shares fell 5.2% Friday, closing below its 50-day line for the first time in months.Q3 earnings per share minus items rose 23% to $9.06 while total revenue climbed 20% to $22.45 billion vs. consensus estimates of $8.60 and $22.05 billion. Google-parent Alphabet signaled higher investments in its  cloud computing business and higher Q4 marketing costs tied to the September launch of Pixel-branded smartphones and a smart home speaker that competes with Amazon's Echo. Google's Q3 net revenue — despite higher traffic acquisition costs (TAC) costs of $4.18 billion — was $18.27 billion, topping views.Alphabet shares nearly hit a record high Friday morning, but closed the day fractionally higher and the week fractionally lower, but still in buy range.Tesla Motors earned 71 cents a share excluding items, soundly beating the consensus estimate of a 54-cent loss. Revenue climbed 45% to $2.3 billion, up 45% and topping estimates of $1.977 billion. Elon Musk had pushed Tesla to boost deliveries and turn a profit in Q3, but some analysts are skeptical that the effort is sustainable. Tesla maintained its guidance of 50,000 vehicle deliveries for the second half of 2016, with a Q4 plan of just over 25,000.Tesla and SolarCity (SCTY) late Friday were expected to unveil an integrated product offering of solar panels, battery storage and charger. Tesla is in the process of buying SolarCity. Elon Musk is the top shareholder in both companies, as well as SpaceX.Tesla found resistance at the 50-day line and reversed, ending the week down 12 cents at 199.97. SolarCity climbed 2.7%.Gigamon (GIMO) reported third quarter profit and revenue that blew past estimates and raised current quarter guidance. Santa Clara, Calif.-based Gigamon said Q3 EPS minus items rose 64% to 36 cents, while revenue jumped 47% to $83.5 million. Analysts had projected 31 cents and $79.6 million. In the current quarter, Gigamon forecast EPS of 37 cents and revenue of $92 million at its midpoint of guidance vs. consensus estimates of 33 cent profit and 29% revenue growth to $86 million. Analysts say AT&T (T) may be a new customer, joining T-Mobile US (TMUS).Gigamon shot up 16.1% Friday, hitting a record high intraday. Shares had fallen 5.2% Thursday to below its 50-day line.Lumentum (LITE) said Q1 EPS rose 69% to 44 cents and revenue climbed 19% to $252.3 million, topping expectations but current quarter revenue guidance was light amid a telecom component shortage from an unnamed supplier. EPS guidance of 51 cents at the midpoint was above consensus estimates of 49 cents. Lumentum fell 3.7% after its late Thursday report, but that followed a 4.3% fall Thursday as Acacia Communications (ACIA) crashed 16% that day and for the week. Chinese telecom gear giant ZTE, a key Acacia customer, reported weak revenue.Qualcomm announced a deal to buy NXP Semiconductors for $39 billion, creating the No. 2 chipmaker by revenue after Intel (INTC). Including debt, the deal is worth $47 billion. Mobile-communications chipmaker Qualcomm said the acquisition will expand its footprint into key growth markets, including automotive, Internet of Things, security and networking. The Qualcomm-NXP transaction marks the biggest semiconductor deal ever, surpassing Avago Technologies' $37 billion purchase of Broadcom (AVGO).New Oriental Education and Technology (EDU) met fiscal Q1 EPS views with a 15% gain to 90 cents. Revenue climbed 16.5%, above analysts' expectations, as enrollment boomed. The IBD 50 stock sees Q2 revenue above analyst guidance. Fellow Chinese for-profit school stock TAL Education (XRS) Q2 results topped estimates as total student enrollment jumped 77%. It guided Q3 revenue above Wall Street views. New Oriental stock rose more than 10% for the week, blasting out of a base to a new high.

Panera Bread (PNRA) beat views, sending the stock higher intraday Wednesday, but reversed lower, falling to an eight-month low on Thursday. Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) met EPS views and missed on sales, but shares rose 6% Thursday from recent lows.Food delivery services provider GrubHub (GRUB) reported that EPS rose 73% and revenue 44%, both topping. But Grubhub's active diners rose by 19%, missing estimates slightly.

Thursday, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) rose 5%, Celgene (CELG) 7% and Alexion (ALXN) 9% after beating on earnings. Amgen (AMGN) late Thursday beat, but shares tumbled nearly 10% Friday amid concerns about key drug Enbrel going forward. Also Friday, Novo Nordisk (NVO) dived 13% and Sanofi (SNY) rose 4.3%, as the European drugmakers had different views on the outlook for insulin treatments.Meanwhile, drug distributor McKesson (MCK) crashed 22.7% Friday after a big miss, blaming rival AmerisourceBergen (ABC) for heavy competition and further pressure from political attention on drug prices. AmerisourceBergen fell 13% and Cardinal Health (CAH) nearly 10%, with both reporting earnings next week.RELATED:Bristol-Myers, Celgene Stocks Rocket After Sweeping Q3 ExpectationsBiogen Q3 Tops; Alzheimer's Data Vs.

3118,CMG,"Any individual investor who's on the lookout for the best stocks to buy -- or a top mutual fund -- can take inspiration from Michael Carmen, a portfolio manager of $4.4 billion Hartford Growth Opportunities (HGOAX).Carmen knows exactly what he likes. He seeks companies with -- to put it simply -- giddyap.""We call it ATOM. We look for companies with accelerating tangible operating momentum,"" Carmen said. That means latching on to good stocks whose revenue growth and margin improvement will both speed up.Those traits open the door to positive earnings surprises and share-price gains.And the fund is an IBD Best Mutual Funds of 2016 award winner, having outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31. Only 9% of U.S. diversified stock funds met that standard.Click Here To See A List Of IBD Mutual Fund Quarterly LeadersCarmen is 54 years old and a senior managing director of Wellington Management, subadvisor of Growth Opportunities. His sidekicks on the Opportunities fund are Mario Abularach and Stephen Mortimer. Carmen is also a manager of additional funds, including $1.1 billion Hartford Global Capital Appreciation. From his office in Boston, overlooking the city's historic harbor, he talked with IBD about his investment approach with Opportunities.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersIBD: What makes this fund different from rival large-cap growth portfolios?Carmen: We're looking for companies where we have a differentiated view. So even if we find a company with accelerating revenue growth but that's already reflected in the market price, that's not interesting to us. It's interesting when we have a higher view one or two years out than the consensus view. Our approach is less about getting the next quarter right and more about getting the next couple of years right.IBD: How important is valuation in your buy-sell decisions?Carmen: We do have a valuation overlay, which looks at every company's upside case vs. their downside case. We want to skew the portfolio to those companies where the ratio is greater than 2-to-1 on the upside vs. the downside ratio.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category Performance LeadersIBD: The fund is in the top 3% of its large-cap-growth peer group of mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the past five years as of Sept. 30. But year to date, it's in the middle of the pack. Why has this year been so challenging for the fund?Carmen: Investors need to stick to their knitting. The biggest mistake managers make is to meander and try to do the (investment) style du jour. We've stuck to our knitting. But over the past year the style that worked best (seeks) high-stability, low-volatility stocks (in) consumer staples, utilities, telecom services.Those are groups that are typically not in the sweet spot of what we do.IBD: Yet the market has been uniformly favorable to those defensive sectors. Do you expect that to help you?Carmen: Yes, it's been a tale of two markets. January to early February, the market got pummeled after a solid 2015. Stocks we invest in got hit hard. But it was a great buying opportunity for the types of stocks we like. We didn't pivot to safer stocks. We doubled down on companies we like with great long-term prospects. It was one of the better buying opportunities in the last five years.IBD: What were some of your moves earlier this year?Carmen: We sold Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan (JPM) because our thesis on those companies was predicated on interest rates moving back up. But coming out of the second quarter and in view of Brexit, the ability of the Federal Reserve to raise rates in a meaningful manner was compromised.IBD'S TAKE: How will investors react once the Fed finally hikes rates? Understanding the stock market's prevailing trend is a key factor when you are choosing between growth and defensive stock buys. For pointers, visit IBD University.IBD: What buys did you make?Carmen: We added to some positions. We've been buying some Chipotle (CMG) and other stocks like Expedia (EXPE), and we added to Priceline (PCLN).IBD: Facebook's (FB) earnings-per-share growth has sped up for four quarters. Why have you trimmed your exposure in recent disclosures?Carmen: Facebook remains one of our largest holdings, as of Aug. 31. It has been about their ability to monetize mobile traffic. When they first came public, they didn't have a great solution. They finally came up with one, particularly with advertising geared to small and medium-size businesses. But our trims were not fundamentally related. They were to take profits off the table and reinvest in other ideas.IBD: As of your latest disclosure, what's your view on Alibaba (BABA)? You've boosted your stake several portfolio reports in a row.Carmen: They are the premier e-commerce site in China. Investors tried to put them into a U.S. box -- are they Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL)? The answer was all of the above and none of the above. They're a little different.Alibaba's core is a business-to-business platform. Their Taibao is a small/medium business-to-consumer and consumer-to-consumer site. It's a big bazaar. Their Tmall is a brands-to-consumer retail site. They also have a similar product to Amazon Web Services (which is called Alibaba Cloud). And they have investments they (often) don't get credit for.Some people are a little confused by it all. In recent months they've taken steps to make themselves more transparent with financial reporting for each business line. That was a big driver. We added to the stock. When Alphabet and Amazon took steps like that, both stocks took off. We felt Alibaba would make a similar move once investors got more comfortable with the business model.IBD: You've trimmed Amazon recently. Why?Carmen: It's still a big overweight. There isn't a lot we dislike. Over the last 18 months the stock has made a huge move. We like to take profits as a company becomes larger. It puts risk-reward back into balance.IBD: Summarize what you do like there, please.Carmen: What amazes me most is that they are taking 50 cents of each incremental dollar spent online. Regardless of everyone coming at them (with competitive challenges), they have become almost a habit (for online users). And they are willing to take risks. They created their AWS business out of nothing. It is fast-growing, profitable, far ahead of the competition in terms of innovation.IBD: Align Technology (ALGN) is a newcomer to your portfolio. Why?Carmen: They make clear aligners or braces for people's teeth. They're a less invasive way of moving people's teeth (than old-fashioned braces). So they have a great product and great distribution.Their growth rate accelerated. We had a view that this would transpire. We bought it a few quarters ago, and it's up about 50% from our purchase price.IBD: American Tower (AMT) looks like a steady Eddie. Is that why you like it?Carmen: The stock came under pressure last year because growth was slowing. The strong dollar hurt them in emerging markets. But their underlying business is very stable. If they have, let's say, two customers renting space on a tower and a third comes along, that's very profitable because they have fixed costs. Their incremental profits are strong.International markets offer them greater opportunities for upgrades to 4G service. So returns on equity and on invested capital will improve in the next several years, which will reverberate with investors.IBD: You took profits on Alphabet in Q2. What's your view?Carmen: We still have an overweight (vs. the Russell 3000 Growth Index). They have been penalized because their investments (in such things as Care.com (CRMC)) mask the strength and growth of their core search business. So an investor is not compensated now for some investments that could pay off.They just put up one of their strongest quarters in years. They have a run rate (in revenues) of $70 billion and are growing revenue north of 20% last quarter. The stock is inexpensive. At a teens multiple, you're not paying much for the cash on their balance sheet.Their (old) name has become a verb. Not many companies do that. It's a strong position.IBD: I hear you enjoy yoga exercise. How did you get interested? And have you -- you're 5-foot-9 -- given up basketball for exercise?Carmen: I started yoga about 12 years ago in order to increase flexibility and clear my mind. I usually do yoga about twice a week in a good week, and I feel great afterwards. It helps supplement other stuff I do like running, spin and lifting weights.I ""retired"" from basketball about five or six years ago when I realized that I was one cut away from blowing out my Achilles heel, the bane of older guys' existence. Plus, I was getting hit in the head and legs too much.RELATED:Janus Forty Managers Win With Bets On Proven Champs, Up-And-Comers And Calculated RisksThis Top Mutual Fund Manager Wins With 3 Flavors Of Growth StocksMutual Fund Awards 2016: Top U.S. Equities Funds

3119,CMG,"The U.S. economy added 156,000 jobs in September, coming in modestly below expectations of 168,000, the Labor Department said Friday. The jobless rate rose to 5.0%.The 151,000 job gain initially reported in August was revised up to 167,000, but the prior month was revised down by 23,000 (from 275,000 to 252,000).The report is unlikely to shift the Federal Reserve's December timetable for hiking its key interest rate. A hike in November — just before the election — is seen as doubtful. But markets have been on edge lately about the possibility of faster-than-expected hikes in 2017, with the 10-year Treasury yield closing at a four-month high on Thursday.Do You Use An Online Broker? Now's the chance to tell how well your needs are met. IBD's annual investor survey on brokers' performance is underway. Click to take the survey now. Stocks opened modestly higher but closed lower with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both losing 0.3%.Average hourly earnings rose 0.2% from September and 2.6% from a year ago, just off the 2.7% cycle high for hourly wage growth marked in July.In recent months, companies have been raising wages and talking about rising, if still moderate, wage pressures. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Starbucks (SBUX) and Wal-Mart (WMT) have hiked their minimum wage. Wendy's (WEN), Ross Stores (ROST), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and others have said they're paying more as they compete for top talent, incentivize performance and keep up with minimum wage laws.The workweek ticked higher to 34.4 hours after sinking over the summer, suggesting a bit less slack in the labor force than indicated by the August report. Along the same lines, the household survey showed that 444,000 people entered the workforce last month, increasing the participation rate to 62.9%. The rise in the jobless rate, up from 4.9% in recent months, came because more people joined the workforce than reported having jobs, even though the latter number grew by 354,000.IBD'S TAKE: How can you tell if a jobs report is too hot, too cold, or just right? Markets may react negatively or positively on the day of the report, but the key for investors is to stay abreast of the market's prevailing trend. Visit IBD University for a primer on how to time the stock market and read The Big Picture column every day.A weaker-than-expected report isn't likely to trouble the Fed, since most policymakers think that the U.S. is close to full employment — the point at which job gains only need to match the net additions to the workforce, or else wage and inflation pressures will intensify.John Williams, president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve, laid out that case that monthly job gains should slow back in August: ""The current pace of job gains is well above what we need, which I put to be somewhere around 80,000 a month, although estimates range from 50,000 to around 100,000.""Williams added: ""We should expect the pace of job gains to slow, and no one should be alarmed when it does.""With two more jobs reports after this one before the Fed meets Dec. 13 and 14, some economists are saying that it would take three weak reports in a row to derail a year-end hike.RELATED:The Goldilocks Economy Is Shrinking When It Comes To Jobs

3120,CMG,"Outside of pizza joints like Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Papa John's (PZZA), a broad swath of restaurant stocks haven't been too hot this year amid consumer anxieties and uncertainty from global affairs, and even one-time leader Panera (PNRA) is breaking down.The breadth of the sell-off has also been notable: Fast-food, fast-casual and casual-dining stocks have not been spared. And on Wednesday, Wedbush cut its price target on Starbucks (SBUX) to 65 from 70 and said restaurant checks point to 4% Americas same-store sales growth in the fourth quarter, below consensus for 5% comp growth.But he also noted that even with a deceleration, that lower full-year projected comp trajectory ""remains among the best in restaurants.""Starbucks shares dipped 0.4% to 53.98.

For more on short selling, read IBD's column The Short Side.Also Wednesday, RBC Capital Markets analysts pointed to relative at-home food deflation weighing on restaurant industry sales, adding that fast-food same-store sales growth has continued to be ""relatively slow.""""With comparisons becoming more difficult, our guess is that industry SSS (same-store sales) could turn flat to slightly negative in the fall and winter quarters,"" wrote analysts in a collective note on the state of the consumer.RBC added that McDonald's (MCD) all-day breakfast offerings could help it to lap last year's figures, however, and Wendy's (WEN) seems to have overcome its slow start to Q3. But he said Restaurant Brands' (QSR) Burger King ""has struggled to regain momentum in the current promotional environment.""Meanwhile, Sonic (SONC), which fell short of its own sales and profit expectations, blamed the miss mainly on ""lower-than-expected traffic, reflecting lower consumer spending in restaurants and continued aggressive competitive activity,"" according to Sonic CEO Cliff Hudson in a preliminary earnings release.Sonic shares plunged 7.2% Wednesday to close at 25.44.RELATED:Investors Are Losing Faith In McDonald's, Losing Hope In ChipotleWhy Domino's, Papa John's Are Hot Restaurant Stocks Now

These occur when a stock opens sharply higher than the previous day's close, leaving a gap between the current day's low and the previous day's high.The pattern is a powerful symbol of a stock's strength, a sign that institutional investors are ""falling all over themselves to grab these stocks,"" said MarketSmith manager Irusha Peiris. ""A lot of super stocks -- Facebook (FB), Tesla (TSLA) -- started with breakaway gaps.""Breakaway gaps have become much more common since the Securities and Exchange Commission enacted rules in 2000 requiring publicly traded companies to disclose important information to all investors at the same time.Before that, companies would often leak market-moving information piecemeal in meetings with analysts or other market professionals, putting other investors at a disadvantage. ""When analysts talked to management all the time, management might divulge information,"" Peiris said. ""Now they can't do that.""While providing information to everybody at once has leveled the playing field, it has also created an environment in which investors pile into -- or bail out of -- a stock all at once. Earnings have become an especially gut-wrenching time for shareholders, since stocks can move wildly depending on the results.""We've always known how important earnings are, but with all these vicious gaps up and down we're trying to help customers stay on top of it,"" Peiris said.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is an example of a stock that gapped up twice in 2010, the first time on April 22 and the second time on Oct. 22 in the midst of an advance that saw the stock quadruple from a breakout over a 98.76 cup-base entry in January of that year. At the time, the burrito and taco chain was posting solid profit and sales growth.""It's sometimes the second gap up that really accelerates the stock,"" Peiris said, adding ""the gaps up are a potential new source of ideas.""The screen captures both earnings gaps up and down. It also flags stocks in the screen with earnings coming up, giving investors a chance to sell shares to minimize the risk of a sharp earnings-related sell-off, or use IBD's options strategy to maximize upside potential while minimizing downside risk.""Hopefully that will help our customers avoid a gap down,"" Peiris said. ""If a lot of breakaway gaps fail, maybe the market isn't so good."" Breakaway gaps are kept on the screen for 90 days to evaluate their performance.A feature on earnings-related gaps up was added this past week, along with a service that sends e-mails to customers every Friday that lists top stocks reporting earnings the following week. Another email identifies stocks that have gapped up or down following their quarterly earnings reports.

3126,CMG,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) tellers, Starbucks (SBUX) baristas and Wal-Mart (WMT) cashiers have all received a significant bump up in pay in recent months, and the latest round of earnings calls from Corporate America shows that they have plenty of company.In recent weeks, Wendy's (WEN), Ross Stores (ROST), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and others have said they're paying more as they compete for top talent, incentivize performance and keep up with minimum wage laws.The broad upward pressure on wages is still fairly modest, but it appears to be picking up, based on the latest Treasury data on federal income and employment taxes withheld from paychecks. In the past four weeks through Aug. 19, withheld taxes rose 4.7% from a year earlier, the fastest pace since the start of November.The data, which are roughly consistent with 2% growth in aggregate hours worked and 2.7% higher wages, still don't qualify as robust. By comparison, withheld taxes rose about 5.5% from a year earlier during the first half of 2015, and growth exceeded 7% for most of 2006.Yet the upward trend is worth watching, both because it could signal stronger consumer activity and because it could shift the Federal Reserve's view of the economy and the interest-rate outlook.IBD'S TAKE: With wage growth picking up, investors may want to focus on companies with a strong enough position in their markets to withstand labor inflation without suffering a hit to profit margins. Read this Investor's Corner on profit margins.Still, a continued acceleration in income growth isn't a sure thing.

3127,CMG,"Today's Investor's Corner kicks off a short series of articles detailing why some breakouts fail and how to handle them when they do.Failures are not at all unusual. They are generally simple to handle so long as you cut losses and keep a careful eye on your quarry.Teen retail chain rue21 staged what looked like a very solid breakout on July 7, 2011 (1) (weekly chart is shown). The five-month cup with handle was just 23% deep. The base was a first-stage pattern, and the stock had been public for less than two years, also a plus.But some red flags were waving.Institutional activity over the course of the base was skewed toward distribution. This activity rippled into the handle (2). The volume, rather than drying up along the length of the handle, was jerky, with heavier weekly volume on the downside. This isn't the kind of orderly shakeout you like to see ahead of a breakout.The handle also dipped nearly 15%, beyond the 12% limit that defines a well-behaved stock.The breakout, a powerful 8% spike in better than double its average trade, past a 34.93 buy point did not erase these elements of risk.Rue21 rose for two days, then began a rapid pullback in generally light trade. It dropped to a test of 50-week support, violating the 8% sell rule July 27 (3). Technically, this marked a failed breakout.In real terms, the breakout still had a fighting chance. A great many breakouts -- particularly in the challenging market of late -- have pulled back below the 8% loss level, then reversed to retake the buy point and move on to new highs.Recent examples include Hi-Tech Pharmacal and Starbucks (SBUX) in September and October 2011. More recently, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Nu Skin Enterprises (NUS) and W.W. Grainger (GWW) have recovered after triggering the golden sell rule to retake new highs.The lesson: Keep your eye on the ball, even if it has failed.Rue21's death knell came in the first two sessions of August (4). The stock cut its 50-day moving average with a big loss in mildly above-average trade Aug. 1 (please see a daily chart). On Aug. 2, it sliced its 200-day line with an even larger drop in heavier volume.The stock has since failed to regain its 50-day moving average. It's 42% below the July buy point.(Editor's Note: This story was originally published in the Jan. 9, 2012, edition of IBD.)
"
3128,CMG,"Chipotle Mexican Grill's (CMG) first better-burger location, called Tasty Made, will apply its focus on higher-quality ingredients and menu minimalism to the ultracompetitive burger business.The menu for Tasty Made, which will open in Lancaster, Ohio, this fall, will consist only of burgers, fries and milkshakes made from ""high quality ingredients that are grown and raised with respect for the animals, the land, and the farmers who produce them,"" according to company statement.""Early fast food burger restaurants generally had focused menus,"" Steve Ells, Chipotle's co-CEO, said in the statement.""We think there's great strength in that original fast food model and wanted to create a restaurant built around that,"" he added. ""Making only burgers, fries and shakes with really great ingredients, we think we can appeal to peoples' timeless love of burgers, but in a way that is consistent with our long-term vision.""But the opening, and Chipotle's attempts to diversify and tap better-burger nostalgia, would come amid heavy competition among burger chains. Traditional fast-food giants like McDonald's (MCD) and Restaurant Brands International's (QSR) Burger King are likely to compete on value, while better-burger rivals like Shake Shack (SHAK), Habit Restaurants (HABT) and In-N-Out are trying to compete more on quality.Shares of Chipotle finished trading up 1.1% to 430.55 on the stock market today. McDonald's shaved off 6 cents to 119.42, Restaurant Brands rose 1.9% to 44.67, Shake Shack lost 0.3% to 40.22 and Habit climbed 1.9% to 16.44.IBD'S TAKE: While parts of the restaurant sector struggled during the second quarter, companies that have more focus on digital ordering -- like Domino's Pizza, Papa John's and GrubHub -- are up. Compare and contrast restaurant stocks at IBD's Stock Checkup. Reports of Chipotle's interest in opening a burger restaurants first surfaced several months ago. The company has also opened an Asian restaurant and backed a fast-casual pizza restaurant.But sales in the restaurant sector overall also appeared to slow during the second quarter due to aggressive value offerings and consumers' economic uncertainty.Chipotle's plans also come as the company tries to revive sales and customer sentiment following a foodborne-illness outbreak last year. The chain's second-quarter results showed struggles on that front, but its limited-time loyalty program, Chiptopia, has provided some relief on that front.Expanding its menu has also helped. Chipotle recently added chorizo to its menu in some restaurants, with plans to bring the item to all Chipotle locations by the end of the year.Ells noted during the company's earnings call last week that such a move was ""unusual"" for a chain that has kept its menu simple.""But we have never ruled out additions or changes to the menu, and chorizo is one of the few changes that we have made to the menu in 23 years,"" he said then.
"
3129,CMG,"Since the fall, McDonald's (MCD) sales gains have been carried in large part by All Day Breakfast, and in smaller part by a stronger value offering, as well as some concessions to the rising demand for higher-quality ingredients.But as restaurant-industry sales trends slow and McDonald's approaches some difficult year-over-year comparisons, U.S. same-restaurant sales and any commentary on the future will likely be a focus when the fast-food giant reports Tuesday.Analysts expect McDonald's to post earnings per share of $1.38, up 9.5% from a year earlier. Total sales are seen slipping 3% to $6.3 billion. Same-restaurant sales are expected to rise around 3.3%.McDonald's launched All Day Breakfast in October. The expansion quickly proved a success, with more diners buying breakfast during later hours or tacking on a breakfast item to their lunch or dinner. The company this month said it would add more items to the breakfast menu in September.IBD'S TAKE: McDonald's stock is in buy range from a 124.18 entry point. But the dividend giant is rated 17th in IBD's Retail-Restaurants group. To see who the real leaders are, go to IBD's Stock Checkup.But some analysts have worried that cheaper value offerings, while essential for competition, have weighed on restaurant sales during Q2. They also worry that consumer optimism has waned as rising gas prices leave less spending room for eating out and as social, economic and political anxieties escalate.Starbucks (SBUX) said Thursday that weaker consumer confidence, geopolitical uncertainty and civil unrest are impacting brands everywhere.The strong dollar could also hurt international sales. RBC Capital Markets on Friday cut McDonald's full-year EPS outlook following the U.K.'s ""Brexit"" vote in June.Others suggest that All Day Breakfast may have masked McDonald's struggles elsewhere, and that it will be hard for the company to keep up year-over-year growth in the quarters ahead. In particular, RBC said in a research note Thursday, ""finding the right value message remains a struggle,"" potentially turning off many customers who go to McDonald's because the food is affordable.""The McPick 2 for $5 has been a sales driver, and it has been good for restaurant margins,"" RBC analyst David Palmer wrote. However, he said, ""the chain continues to wrestle with a 'Dollar Menu hangover' and prices for its premium items that are perhaps too high for perceived quality (e.g., relative to chains such as Chick-fil-A or In N Out).""Many franchisees resisted the Dollar Menu, which McDonald's has since replaced with McPick, complaining that it was difficult to juggle higher labor costs and food items sold for a buck apiece. But Cowen analyst Andrew Charles raised questions about the company's promotion of the McPick during part of the second quarter.""We believe there is risk of a soft Q2 top line ... as MCD paused the heavy value-centric messaging seen in Q1 during April and May,"" Charles said in a research note this week.He added that the company's Monopoly promotion, as well as its promotional efforts tied to ""The Angry Birds Movie,"" ""did not allow the brand to emphasize value as much as the soft industry backdrop demanded."" He said the company stepped up promotion for the McPick in June.On the quality front, McDonald's during the quarter said it would test fresh hamburger patties in the Dallas region.In a Nomura survey of a handful of franchisees published this week, some suggested the fresh-patty test would help consumer perception. Others, however, warned it wouldn't necessarily drive sales, while raising a host of food-prep and safety issues. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is still struggling to rebound from foodborne illness scares last year, and its Q2 results missed estimates Thursday.""We are the lightning rod,"" one McDonald's franchisee said. ""Chipotle will be a walk in the park if we have an incident.""McDonald's stock fell 0.7% to 127.40 on the stock market today. McDonald's is still above a 124.18 buy point in a double-bottom base. The W-shaped consolidation is a bullish pattern.
"
3130,CMG,"Stocks were mixed in early afternoon trading Tuesday as investors weighed generally positive economic data against some high-profile earnings misses.McDonald's (MCD) led restaurant stocks lower, while gunmaker Smith & Wesson (SWHC) broke out past a buy point.The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.2%, the S&P 500 was flat and the Nasdaq was up 0.2%. Volume in the stock market today was tracking higher on both the NYSE and Nasdaq compared to Monday.Smith & Wesson was a bright spot, however, rising 2% and clearing a 29.85 buy point of a cup-with-handle base in heavy volume. The stock's Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A- indicates strong demand for the shares.The move up came after Smith & Wesson announced plans to buy Crimson Trace, a maker of laser sighting systems, for $95 million.IBD'S TAKE:  To find out how Smith & Wesson stacks up against rivals in the safety & security industry, see IBD's Stock Checkup feature.Restaurant stocks were among the worst performers. McDonald's led the Dow lower, sinking more than 4% in heavy turnover and slicing through its 50-day moving average.McDonald's said Tuesday that Q2 profit rose 12% to $1.45 a share, beating Wall Street forecasts. Sales dipped 4% to $6.3 billion, slightly below views. But the burger chain's same-store sales trailed analyst estimates.Meanwhile, Stifel Nicolaus downgraded several restaurant stocks to hold from buy on fears of a looming recession.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) plunged 6%, pulling back into buying range from a 45.01 flat-base entry.Dave & Buster's (PLAY) lost 5% and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) lost 2%.Meanwhile, managed care stock Centene (CNC) led the IBD 50 lower, diving 10% despite a better-than-expected quarterly earnings report.The company said it won't bid for businesses that larger insurers plan to auction off as the industry consolidates.Economic data were generally positive as the Federal Reserve kicked off a two-day meeting Tuesday. The central bank is expected to hold interest rates steady amid concerns about the global economic outlook.Sales of new homes rose 3.5% in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 592,000, the highest level since February 2008.Meanwhile, the Conference Board's index of consumer confidence dipped 0.1 point to 97.3, still better than expected.
"
3131,CMG,"Like other restaurant chains this earnings season, Shake Shack (SHAK) said on its second-quarter earnings call that Brexit, terrorism abroad and global economic strains could remain troubling, even though the fast-casual burger chain said it remained upbeat about the future.""Internationally, we are not immune to global economic and political uncertainty,"" Shake Shack CEO Randy Garutti said on the call Wednesday.He added that ""recent terrorism in Istanbul"" would continue to hurt business at its four locations there. A shooting and suicide bombing in June at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport, Turkey's largest, killed 45 people. Then, last month, a failed coup attempt by a faction in the military resulted in a massive government purge from the nation's military, legal system, education system and media.Garutti also said that the company's Middle East business -- its website lists 26 locations in the region -- ""continues to experience headwinds, given the regional challenges, and the volatility of the oil market.""The U.K.'s vote in June to leave the European Union, he said, also ""brings new uncertainty"" that could keep the pound weak against the dollar. Garutti said Shake Shack would ""temper our near-term expectations.""McDonald's (MCD) and Starbucks (SBUX) also described a less-certain consumer during their earnings calls.Shares sank 6.2% to 38.35 in the stock market today, though they are currently holding above their 50-day and 200-day moving averages.That followed weaker-than-expected Q2 same-store sales growth. However, Shake Shack's Q2 earnings per share and overall revenue beat Street estimates, and the company raised full-year revenue guidance above views.Shake Shack also said it expected to open 18 domestic company-run locations this year, up from 16.IBD'S TAKE: While people might have been more reluctant to dine out during the second quarter, stocks like Domino's Pizza, Papa John's and GrubHub -- which lean more on digital ordering, delivery and takeout -- are way up comparatively. Read more about the fast-food and burger wars here. The sight of more empty tables at restaurants ""may be the result of consumers eating more at home amid the current political/social backdrop, which we believe could last through the November election,"" according to a KeyBanc analyst report cited by MarketWatch.Stocks like Papa John's (PZZA), whose business depends more on pickup and delivery, stand to benefit as a result, the note said.Papa John's and Domino's Pizza (DPZ) are among the minority of restaurants to report strong earnings reports. Domino's is slightly extended from a breakout last month following quarterly results. Papa John's is consolidating near highs, forming a handle with a 78.19 buy point.Lower grocery-store prices and some harsh weather in some parts of the U.S. also weighed on second-quarter restaurant sales.Shake Shack's play for a higher-end fast-food consumer, however, means it doesn't have to worry as much about competing on value meals, the way traditional fast-food chains do.The company, SunTrust analyst Jake Bartlett said in a note, ""is largely immune to the current industry slowdown given its differentiation."" And Cowen analyst Andrew Charles said that the firm viewed Shake Shack's ""softness as temporary"". Others felt it was a good time to buy the stock, saying that even though its valuation has fallen its long-term potential remains strong.Newer menu items and limited-time offerings also helped, management said. The Chick'n Shack sandwich accounted for 8.4% of Q2 sales. Its Bacon Cheddar Shack ""has been the best performing LTO (limited time offering) we've run since we launched the LTO program last year."" The company has also tried out breakfast menu items in a handful of spots.Those menu adjustments come as restaurants try to draw new customers without cluttering up their menus and losing their identity. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), another fast-casual chain often praised for its concise menu, also said that the addition of chorizo to its menus had helped draw customers.Shake Shack also said it had higher labor costs during the quarter, but that the impact was cushioned by its sales growth. Management said on the call that they ""still expect labor pressure"" this year, following a recent wage increase.""But as we get to the second half of the year, we're going to continue to invest in our teams, in this competitive environment, to get the right people, in order to get the people that we need, in order to continue to execute the way that we have,"" CFO Jeff Uttz said on the call.McDonald's rose 0.5% Thursday, while Domino's Pizza gained 0.7% and Papa John's 0.9%. Starbucks fell 0.3%.

Civil unrest.Calling the 4% growth in U.S. same-store sales an ""anomaly,"" Starbucks (SBUX) management said during the earnings call that several factors contributed to weaker-than-expected comps in the third quarter, including the rollout of the tweaked Starbucks Rewards loyalty program that threw the company's regular summer promotion schedule off balance and ""interrupted frappuccino momentum in the quarter.""In addition to the impact of juggling two marketing campaigns -- the new rewards program rollout and ""Frappuccino Happy Hour"" -- weaker consumer confidence, geopolitical uncertainty and civil unrest are impacting brands everywhere, it said.CEO Howard Schultz called the environment ""quite unusual,"" and different from previous stretches that have experienced economic downturns, but sounded bullish on regaining comp momentum going forward as the new program changes were a ""one-time event.""Starbucks cut full-year global same-store sales growth outlook to mid-single digits, down from prior guidance for ""somewhat above mid-single digits,"" as third-quarter revenue left investors with a bad taste in their mouths.IBD'S TAKE: Starbucks is a household name, but it's not a top-shelf stock right now. It's ranked 18th in the IBD Retail-Restaurant group. Meanwhile, Domino's Pizza broke out of a base to a new high on strong earnings Thursday. For Domino's key fundamental and technical ingredients -- and how it compares to top restaurant stocks, go to IBD Stock Checkup.The global coffee-shop titan also said it now sees full-year consolidated revenue growth of 10%, down from prior guidance for ""10%+"" growth. It reaffirmed EPS of $1.88-$1.89 for the year, and anticipates per-share profit of 54-55 cents for Q4, on the light side of current Street views for 55 cents a share.In Q3, adjusted earnings grew 17% to 49 cents a share, matching views, while sales fell short of estimates with 7% growth to $5.24 billion. Analysts had expected $5.33 billion.Shares fell 3% in late trading in the stock market today after closing up 0.1% in regular trade Thursday. The stock may test its 50-day moving average at Friday's open, after retaking that key line in late June.For the quarter, global same-store sales rose 4%. Americas same-store sales grew 4%. China/Asia Pacific comps rose 3%. Comps in China, a high-growth market of heavy focus for the company, alone grew 7%.Java drinkers apparently didn't mind the loyalty program changes. Starbucks Rewards grew its U.S. membership base by 18% from the prior year to 12.3 million active members. The company recently announced price hikes to some of its beverages.And its mobile push appears to be enjoying solid momentum, with mobile payments now accounting for 25% of all transactions. Its order-in-advance feature, Mobile Order And Pay, now makes up 5% of all orders, said the company.Smaller coffee rival Dunkin' Brands (DNKN), the parent of Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins, reported a mixed bag earlier Thursday.Profit growth of 14% to 57 cents a share topped estimates by a penny, but 2% sales growth to $216.3 million missed views for $219.9 million. Dunkin' Brands closed down 0.7% to 46.74 after falling as low as 44.75.Restaurant peer Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) also reported after the close Thursday and missed earnings and revenue forecasts but said same-store sales trends in July were improving. Chipotle stock fell modestly in late trading.RELATED:Domino's Pizza Breaks Out On Hot Beat, While Dunkin' Traffic Falls.

3133,CMG,"Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) on Thursday emphasized that new efforts to reclaim customers -- including a new menu item and rewards program -- following last year's foodborne illness scares are working, even as the company's second-quarter results missed analyst estimates.The fast-casual chain said that the loyalty program, Chiptopia, has already attracted more than 3.6 million participants since the three-month-long promotion began on July 1, with nearly 30% of all transactions ""engaged in Chiptopia"" since then.The company said those initiatives, combined with a massive marketing effort, had helped to ease same-store sales and transaction declines seen so far this month.""While it has only been a few weeks since Chiptopia launched, we are pleased to see that July sales comp trends have already improved by 200 to 300 basis points, and transaction comp trends have improved by an even greater amount,"" co-CEO Steve Ells said in a statement.But on a conference call later, he characterized Chipotle's sales recovery as ""modest,"" and said the rebound hadn't come as quickly as desired. Management also cautioned that it's still unclear whether the improvement seen this month would last.Shares were down 1.6% late, after spending the past several sessions clinging to the underside of their 50-day line.IBD'S TAKE: A menu revamp has been key to McDonald's recent success, after losing customers for years to fast-casual chains like Chipotle.Chipotle has been trying to recover from the 2015 outbreak, which spread to multiple states and sickened dozens. It has spent more money on new safety standards, mobile and direct-mail promotions, and a new menu item to win back customers the outbreak scared away.Ells noted that adding chorizo was ""unusual"" for a company often praised for its pared-down menu. So far, chorizo accounts for 6%-7% of entree sales at restaurants where the item is available, and the company plans to make it nationwide by the end of the year.But menu expansions can be a tough balancing act for restaurants. They can draw different kinds of diners, but too many additions can overwhelm customers and water down a chain's identity. Prior to McDonald's (MCD) sales turnaround last year, many analysts argued that its menu was too cluttered. McDonald's reports second-quarter results on Tuesday.Chipotle's second-quarter earnings per share sank 80% to 87 cents, missing estimates for 93 cents. Revenue fell 16.6% to $998.4 million, below views for $1.05 billion. Same-store sales fell 23.6%, compared to Street forecasts for around a 20% drop.Given the uncertainty over when the company might rebound, Chipotle has been reluctant to forecast profits for the second and third quarters.Chipotle's results come amid what Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh said was like to be ""a somewhat volatile 2Q earnings season."" Heavy competitive discounting -- lower food prices have inspired a wave of value offerings -- as well as some bad weather and broader economic uncertainty could hit some restaurant chains.Earlier in the day, Domino's Pizza (DPZ) reported second-quarter results that topped analysts' expectations.Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski said in a research note that Domino's domestic same-store sales ""likely will end up being the best of any of the 25 largest U.S. restaurant chains for the second quarter.""U.S. sales strength probably came from the company's shift to digital ordering technology, which has gained popularity with pizza lovers, Kalinowski said. Higher ingredient quality, a better marketing program and the company's loyalty program likely also helped, he said.Domino's jumped 5.7%.

3134,CMG,"Domino's Pizza (DPZ) easily topped Wall Street's second-quarter estimates, sending shares up to a new high at the open Thursday after the stock ended Wednesday's session just below a buy point.Earnings grew 21% to 98 cents a share on 12% revenue growth to $547.3 million, fueled by higher volumes and store growth, said the company. Analysts had expected 94 cents EPS on $534.1 million.Domestic same-store sales rose 9.7% as international comps grew 7.1%.Domino's Pizza shares jumped 5.7% to 144.66 on the stock market today, a new all-time best. The stock cleared a 137.12 entry point of a new buy range. On Wednesday, shares briefly topped that level but closed slightly under it.IBD'S TAKE: Domino's Pizza is a breakout, but it's only the 10th best stock in IBD's Retail-Restaurants group. To see how Domino's stacks up based on objective criteria and vs. its leading peers, go to IBD Stock Checkup.Could recent world events have helped contribute to the view-topping results?KeyBanc Capital Markets upgraded pizza peer Papa John's (PZZA) to overweight from sector weight this week and bumped up its price target, opining that civil unrest and a heated political environment might be prompting people to eat at home -- and order pizza -- instead of going out.Papa John's stock climbed 2.9% Thursday to close at 73.34 after rising 3.15% Wednesday to its best levels since early November.Meanwhile, Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) topped earnings views by a penny as profit grew 14% to 57 cents a share, but revenue fell short of estimates for $219.9 million with 2% growth to $216.3 million.Dunkin' Donuts U.S. comps edged up 0.5%. Baskin-Robbins U.S. comps rose 0.6%. Traffic fell in both segments, the company said, though average tickets rose.""While this was somewhat short of our recently raised +1.4% forecast, the showing in positive territory is likely still enough to ease some concerns we had heard recently from buysiders about the possibility of Q2 same-store sales possibly being negative,"" wrote Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski regarding Dunkin Donuts' comps.Dunkin' also announced a 30 cent per-share cash dividend for the third quarter.Dunkin' shares sank 0.7% to 46.74, but off early lows of 44.75.

Ahead of its quarterly report on Thursday, here's a look at what Wall Street expects from the company.Analysts are currently expecting a 79% drop in per-share profit to 94 cents, down from $4.45 in the prior-year quarter, on a 12% revenue tumble to $1.05 billion.Quick recap: The embattled fast-casual chain clocked in a devastating 29.7% slide in same-restaurant sales in its March-ended quarter and swung to an 88-cent-per-share loss.

He added that the company's lack of a loyalty program (read: lack of customer data) until now may have slowed its recovery following its food-safety stumbles in late 2015.""In addition, 'Chiptopia' and chorizo may represent the first of a broader list of long-term sales drivers, including broadly enhanced mobile capabilities and changes to better utilize the second make line,"" Strelzik went on to say.The Chiptopia loyalty program differs from Starbucks' (SBUX) and other rewards offerings in that it emphasizes visits, not dollars spent.

3151,CMG,"McDonald's (MCD) is reportedly struggling to find qualified bidders for its China outlets in an auction that could bring in as much as $3 billion.The franchising of its China stores is part of the company's earlier reported revitalization plan. The plan also includes revamping its menu, including making breakfasts available all day long, and is seen as a way to distance itself from earlier food scandals in China.In May, McDonald's said it would streamline its international operations into four market segments, each headed by a then-current McDonald's executive, to cut down on bureaucracy.The world's biggest restaurant company has received more than a half-dozen bids. Among the bidders are state-owned China Cinda Asset Management, dairy foods company Beijing Sanyuan Foods, Sanpower Group and noodle shop owner ChemChina, another state-owned company, the Financial Times reported.The franchise auction reportedly involves local partners taking over the company's 2,800-store China and Hong Kong stores for 20 years and paying royalties to McDonald's.After reporting four quarters of shrinking earnings, McDonald's has reported double-digit earnings growth for the last three quarters in a row.

3153,CMG,"The oldest operating McDonald's (MCD), in Downey, Calif., doesn't look like other McDonald's locations across the country. The building is the size of a studio apartment, with horizontal red and white stripes. Towering over the parking lot is a sign that says ""Hamburgers,"" atop which stands Speedee, the hamburger-faced predecessor to Ronald McDonald. A museum contains a shake machine, paper cups and other fast-food artifacts.Just last year, the global icon, once one of the market's most tireless growth stocks, appeared to be on the brink of becoming a museum relic itself. Fast-casual darlings like Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and Shake Shack (SHAK) threatened to render the giant obsolete. But McDonald's has since shown a nimbleness under CEO Steve Easterbrook, who took over in March 2015 and revived sales starting last fall.McDonald's now is approaching some tough year-over-year comparisons, and parts of the industry are reporting weakness during the second quarter. But a follow-up act is in the works that could set the stock on another run, as the 61-year-old company tries to reimagine what a fast-food burger can be without alienating its core customers.""The one good thing about a restaurant is that people have to eat every day, and everybody loves a good burger,"" said Tigress analyst Ivan Feinseth.
"
3154,CMG,"Visiting the Downey McDonald's, which opened in the 1950s, you get the sense that you're about to taste in purer form whatever it was that made a nation — and the world — fall in love with fast food.But bite into a hamburger there, and it tastes like any other hamburger from any other McDonald's being nipped at by ""better-burger"" rivals like Shake Shack, Five Guys and In-N-Out.""The meat's fresh, their fries are not Frankenfoods,"" Feinseth said of a trip to In-N-Out. ""They take the potato, they just julienne it and put it in the fryer. It's fresh, it's delicious, and that, by the way, was what McDonald's was.""That quality helped McDonald's, which came public in 1965, become one of the U.S. stock market's all-time success stories. From its low in the 1973-74 bear market, the stock has soared 23,000%, while blue chip stalwarts like GE (GE) and IBM (IBM) are up 5,000% and 1,600%, respectively. Put another way, $10,000 invested in McDonald's then would be worth $2.31 million now.Recent years, however, have seen a backlash against fast food and changes in eating habits toward fresher ingredients. Many young diners dismissed McDonald's food as poison. The Golden Arches appeared in need of change. But change into what? And from what? Over the past 10 years, what it was had become unclear.Indeed, the company inadvertently nurtured Chipotle into a leader of a fast-casual movement that threatened to kill it.In 2006, McDonald's sold off its ownership of the burrito chain, after having taken a minority stake in 1998. The burger chain said the decision would allow Chipotle to focus on Chipotle, while McDonald's could exact a ""singular focus on brand McDonald's.""Since then, fresh offerings from better-burger rivals lured away customers. Some of McDonald's attempts to go slightly higher-end weren't landing. Demand to be all things to all people, some analysts say, cluttered the menu. And franchisees, already contending with calls to pay employees more, were reluctant to get behind the value offerings the company built much of its reputation on.""For a number of years, (McDonald's) didn't have anything to really say,"" SunTrust Robinson analyst Jake Bartlett told IBD.From mid-2013 to mid-2015, U.S. same-store sales fell or were flat, and the stock meandered through a listless, sideways pattern.Before Steve Easterbrook took over last March, he helped engineer a turnaround in Europe. He became the new CEO of McDonald's U.K. in 2006. Shortly after, he went on BBC's Newsnight to debate Eric Schlosser, author of the 2001 book ""Fast Food Nation,"" among the harshest indictments ever of the fast-food industry.Easterbrook also reduced salt levels in products and introduced more visible nutrition labels, as well as fair-trade, sustainably produced coffee. A McDonald's public-relations campaign called ""Make Up Your Own Mind"" sought to address questions about how the chain's food was made.U.K. division sales improved, and Easterbrook's efforts would serve as a blueprint for the company's turnaround.""That U.K. example is one that I point to, to kind of show that perceptions can change,"" Bartlett said.Since Easterbrook became McDonald's CEO, the company said it would begin using chickens that weren't raised with antibiotics used in human medicine and start working toward sourcing all its eggs for U.S. and Canadian restaurants from cage-free chickens.The company brought back butter and the English muffin to the Egg McMuffin. It showed it was listening and willing to try new things by introducing items such as the Artisan Grilled Chicken sandwich and Buttermilk Crispy Chicken Sandwich. It experimented with digital orders and customization.""I think to some degree, the corporate culture in the past was like, 'Let's perfect everything before we roll it out,' "" Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski said. ""I think part of the cultural change that Steve is bringing is, 'Look, it doesn't have to be perfect for us to roll something out.' ""Those smaller rollouts, announced over 2015, helped pave the way for the biggest one of the year: All Day Breakfast.The October launch of All Day Breakfast, which many say is at the heart of McDonald's recent sales and earnings rebound, was easy for a number of reasons. The marketing, for one, was in the title. And unlike burgers, many breakfast items don't require raising and tending to a cow, so they cost less. Those items were also already on the menu and didn't need the testing required of new products.Making only some breakfast items available all day made the service less difficult to deliver during non-breakfast hours by easing demands on grill space. The service also managed to unlock sales from people who decided that maybe they wanted some breakfast with their lunch or dinner.""People look at one of those Egg McMuffins like a snack item,"" Feinseth said. He later added: ""You get a Quarter Pounder and you add the McMuffin.""Sales strengthened. In Q3 2015, U.S. comps grew 0.9%, followed by a 5.7% gain in Q4 and a 5.4% increase in Q1 2016. Earnings have rebounded to double-digit growth and look to stay there for the next few years after retreating in five out of the last six quarters.Still, total revenue has been falling since mid-2014, as the strong dollar has weighed on overseas results. Future quarters should see a tougher currency headwind.The stronger dollar has weighed on McDonald's international prospects in recent months, making it an underperformer vs. the S&P 500. Shares are down 8% from an all-time intraday high of 131.96 reached May 10. They finished Friday trading up fractionally to 121.31.Nevertheless, the stock is up 25% from a year ago. That easily outpaces Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International's (QSR) 4% uptick as well as declines of 34% at Shake Shack, 4% at Jack In The Box (JACK) and 10% at Wendy's (WEN).That's not to say the breakfast move was painless. ""The kitchen is impossible with All Day Breakfast,"" a franchisee said in a Nomura survey. ""It is killing our people.""But McDonald's didn't retreat. Despite the added complexity all-day breakfast requires, the customers wanted it, and on Wednesday McDonald's announced it will add more breakfast items to the all-day menu.As McDonald's looks to maintain its momentum, the company faces a delicate balancing act: How aggressively should it aim higher, toward better ingredients, without alienating millions of loyal customers who show up for the cheap food? Adding to the dilemma are higher wages, which also push prices higher.To appeal to cost-conscious diners squeezed by an anemic economic expansion that barely added to Americans' pay, value offerings have proliferated. McDonald's had tried out a Dollar Menu, causing an uproar from franchisees while doing little to improve its fast-food image. Then it started the McPick earlier this year, offering two items for $2. Franchisees called that version of the offer an ""absolute disaster"" and ""a suicide mission,"" according to Nomura's survey.But the company's recent decision to bump up the McPick to two items for $5 has worked better, and more gains could be ahead if diners become accustomed to paying the higher price.""At the very least, it teaches consumers McDonald's is not the Dollar-Menu company,"" Kalinowski said. ""I think that's healthy for the McDonald's system in terms of people (not just viewing) McDonald's as cheap food and that's it.""Along those lines, the company in May said it was testing fresh, never-frozen hamburger patties in 14 locations in the Dallas area. It has also tested garlic fries, bratwurst, new Big Macs, breakfast bowls and a Sriracha sauce.But systemwide changes could be slow to come. And a bigger rollout of a fresher hamburger could pressure McDonald's margins and upend preparations behind the counter.SunTrust's Bartlett sees the way forward involving a nationwide marketing effort behind the McPick, noting that higher-end chains like Shake Shack are already known for being more expensive and have leeway to charge more.""You have to be a lot of things to a lot of people. One of the things is you have to have that value consumer; you have to offer a good solution to them,"" he said. ""So this idea of just improving the quality of the food so that you can just charge more, and sales go up, and everyone's happy — some people just don't want to pay more.""But an RBC Capital Markets survey released in May suggested that if McDonald's uses better-quality ingredients, customers are likely to pay more.Perceptions of affordability seemed ""to be more of a function of 'what you get' than 'what you pay,' "" indicating that diners ""will be willing to pay up for what they perceive to be the 'good stuff,' "" RBC said.And despite McDonald's affordable value deals, customers gave it only a middling score on affordability.Meanwhile, Kalinowski singled out McDonald's fresh hamburger test, saying in a research note that it ""has the potential to be a big, big deal,"" as it would give customers better-tasting food cooked more quickly, meaning faster service and more customers cycling through the restaurant.Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy thinks the key to continuing growth is to still have value offerings but to focus on better ingredients.""It helps to widen your audience, it can help change misconceptions about the brand, and I think it speaks to the audience that you're looking for — the younger generation that may have turned its back on McDonald's,"" he said.

3159,CMG,"McDonald's (MCD) said Wednesday that it will add McMuffins, McGriddles and biscuit sandwiches to its All Day Breakfast menu nationwide in September, amid concerns about whether the company's recent sales growth is sustainable as it approaches some tough year-over-year comparisons.Shares dipped 0.1% to 120.63 in the stock market today. The stock is making its way through a flat base and has drifted below its 50-day line since May.The stock has gotten a huge lift since All Day Breakfast was introduced last fall, demonstrating to investors that the company could change and turn around flagging sales after a weak 2014.In the years prior to the launch, McDonald's lost customers to Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and other fast-casual chains tapping into a growing preference for higher-quality or healthier ingredients.But some analysts have questioned whether the burger giant has relied too much on All Day Breakfast for its sales growth. Others say the menu expansion could help prop up sales, but not tremendously.""It's a positive, but it won't have nearly the same impact that the initial All Day Breakfast launch had,"" Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy told IBD.IBD'S TAKE: McDonald's stock is in the midst of a consolidation, but below its 50-day moving average, a sign of weakness. Investors should wait for MCD to build the right side of a base and form a proper entry point before making any moves.Analysts have also worried about slowing industry sales amid broader economic uncertainty.

3165,CMG,"Chipotle Mexican Grill's (CMG) new rewards program doesn't care about points or dollars, but it does very much care about how often you visit every month. But that set-up could limit the program's appeal to casual Chipotle customers, says an analyst who reiterated a sell rating on the stock.Chipotle's new short-term loyalty play -- unlike those offered by Starbucks (SBUX), Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and others -- is looking to bring back repeat customers in the wake of devastating same-restaurant sales brought on by a series of food-borne illness outbreaks.Under its three-month-long Chiptopia Summer Rewards, which runs from July through September, four visits with entree purchases -- not just a drink or a side of beans -- in one month confer ""Mild""-level achievement, i.e. one free entree.Eight entrees a month gives Chipotle customers ""Medium"" status (and another free entree), and 11 entrees earns ""Hot"" status (and yet another free entree).That's relatively generous: Jack in the Box (JACK) burrito chain Qdoba Mexican Eats essentially has a buy 10 entrees get one free, while Freebirds World Burritos lets customers get a free burrito for every $150 spent.But diners have to come back to Chipotle on different days to earn rewards, so making multiple purchases in a day doesn't translate to more freebies. That means that buying four entrees on one visit still counts toward one visit and is worth less than buying three entrees on three different days.Adding another layer of complexity, earning any of the three status levels for three straight months during the promotion period unlocks more freebies, such as catering for 20 people.The program encourages return visits instead of dropping big bucks. While Starbucks rewards customers on a per-dollar basis (a recent change from its per-visit rule), and allows users to rack up ""stars"" over time, Chipotle's rewards levels all reset at the start of each month.The structuring of the program likely has some ties to the E. coli and norovirus outbreaks late last year that scared off customers -- first-quarter comparable-restaurant sales for the March-ended period plummeted 29.7%.Chipotle's complex-but-generous rewards program risks giving away a lot of free burritos and goodies for already-paying customers, but not attracting lapsed or new diners.Maxim analyst Stephen Anderson reiterated a sell rating and 285 price target on Chipotle in a note discussing the rewards program:""We acknowledge that the rewards offered by the Chiptopia Summer Rewards program are not as extreme as the free and buy-one-get-one burrito giveaways instituted earlier in 2016, and may succeed in getting the 'Chipotle loyalist' to make incremental purchases. Nevertheless, we believe that this promotion does not offer much for the larger population of less frequent Chipotle customers (according to a July 2015 study by market research firm Technomic, only 43% of CMG's customers visit more than once a month), and that the company may need to take additional promotional measures in the coming quarters to bring these customers back.""Few other retail loyalty programs operate on a per-visit basis. Starbucks customers kicked up a fuss when the newest changes were unrolled, but they continue to sign up in droves -- and Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski said in February that the new program would prompt people to spend more money.Specialty beauty retailer Ulta Beauty rewards shoppers with a point per dollar, offering $3 off per 100 points earned, with up to $125 off for 2000 points earned. And American Express (AXP) last year introduced a cross-branded program that includes Macy's (M), AT&T (T) and other companies.Chipotle shares fell 3% to 388.78 on the stock market today, the worst close since July 2013 and just above a recent intraday low. The restaurant chain reports Q2 results on July 21.

3172,CMG,"After an hour of talking about refranchising and earnings accretion, Jack In The Box (JACK) said Wednesday it will try to become a higher-end burger chain by tapping into two parallel trends that have developed over the last 20 years.The first: the evolution in diners' preferences away from deep-frozen chicken patties with abstract shapes to fresher, better-tasting fast-food items. The second: a shift within popular culture from cheeky to earnest.When Jack Box, the burger chain's balloon-headed, wise-cracking mascot, was created in 1995, the company was trying to tap into a pop culture then defined by ironic, adversarial posturing. But the company suggested Wednesday at its 2016 investor day that the irony once employed in some of its advertising -- the very device that makes many ads seem pointless, too clever, or halfheartedly mean to many older consumers -- no longer jibes with the culture or the chain's more recent focus on quality.""As we started to really shift the quality of our product and the service that we provide to our customers, it was no longer the right way for us to communicate our brand by letting humor dominate the messaging around our food,"" Richard Cran, vice president, marketing communications, said at the conference.""When Jack was created, the No. 1 reigning sitcom ... was 'Seinfeld,' "" Cran added. ""If you think back to how the finale of 'Seinfeld' ended, it ended with the four friends being put in jail for basically just being unpleasant people -- a little bitter, a little bit too sarcastic. And at times, Jack shifted toward that part of his persona too much.""A slide from the company's investor presentation further detailed the cultural changes. Pop culture, Jack In The Box said, had moved from being ""disenfranchised"" to ""empowered,"" from ""sarcasm"" to ""optimism"", or, say, from ""Pulp Fiction"" to ""The Hunger Games.""So after years of ads in which Jack Box materialized in stoners' dark, TV-lit basements offering food that either cured or helped them explore their loneliness, viewers might now be more likely to see the mascot embark on a what the company called a ""heroic but silent quest for better ingredients and better burgers.""Fast food's flight to quality comes even as the cheap, commodity-induced discounts that have also characterized the industry show no signs of easing. But Frances Allen, Jack In The Box's brand president, said the company's opportunity ""is not to stay in the very value-driven QSR space,"" referring to quick-service restaurants.And she said the company's goal, by 2020, was to move beyond QSR to become a ""top QSR-plus burger destination,"" referring quick-service restaurants branded as higher quality like In-N-Out and Chick-fil-A but aren't as high-quality as fast-casual restaurants like Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG).Those ambitions could raise more questions about whether Jack In The Box might spin off Qdoba Mexican Eats, the fast-casual chain that the company acquired in 2003. Jack In The Box at the conference said it had a ""firm commitment"" to growing Qdoba but that it could consider alternatives if those plans didn't work out.Offering up a specific deadline by which to make that decision would be ""extremely irresponsible"" and distracting to leadership, the company said.Jack In The Box jumped 5.5% in the stock market today to 83.39. McDonald's (MCD), which held its annual shareholder meeting Thursday, inched up 0.4% to 123.79. Chipotle lost 1.3% to 452.03.
"
3173,CMG,"Jack in the Box (JACK) gapped up to a 2016 high Wednesday after the fast-food chain predicted strong profit growth for years by franchising more locations and pulling back on spending in the coming years, following moves McDonald’s (MCD), Wendy’s (WEN) and Restaurant Brands International (QSR) chain Burger King to franchise more.Jack in the Box shares rose 5.25% to 79.05 in the stock market today, hitting their best levels early December. That follows a long comedown amid aggressive competition from other chains, who have inundated customers with value options and attempts to use better ingredients in their food. Analysts say bad weather, and perhaps broader uncertainty about the economy, also weighed on same-store sales for many restaurants last month.Jack in the Box detailed in a slide presentation what its profits could look like if it increased its franchise mix to 90%-95%. The company targeted annual operating EPS growth in the midteens over the next few years following the completion of those plans, which could wrap up by the end of fiscal 2017.The refranchising would follow similar moves from McDonald's, Wendy's and Burger King, which have sought to insulate themselves from higher minimum wages in some areas and other supply costs. Refranchising can help shift more of a restaurant chain's expenses to its local, independent owners.Jack in the Box also said it has lots of room to grow, particularly in areas outside of the West Coast and Texas where Jack in the Box restaurants aren't as prevalent. The company also runs Qdoba Mexican Eats, a smaller rival to Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG). Qdoba has outpaced Jack in the Box's namesake growth, perhaps benefiting from Chipotle's food-illness woes.The company also sees capital expenditures rising this year and next but topping out at $135 million to $140 million from 2018-2020.Wendy's stock rose 1.1%. McDonald's, whose annual shareholder meeting takes place Thursday, fell 0.6%. Restaurant Brands edged down 0.5%. Chipotle Mexican Grill climbed 0.2%.

3176,CMG,"Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is expected to post its first-ever quarterly loss when it reports after the close on Tuesday, as the fast-casual restaurant chain continues to feel the impact of last year's string of E. coli and norovirus outbreaks.Wall Street is predicting a 94-cent per-share loss, slightly better than Chipotle's previously announced expectations for a $1 per-share loss ""or worse.""That would, however, mark a dramatic swing from the year-earlier profit of $3.88 per share. Higher costs related to marketing, promotions, food and labor, among other things, are expected to weigh on Q1 profits, as Chipotle offered free food to lure people back.Revenue is seen declining 20% to $868.5 million. Same-store sales trends have been bleak -- February comps tumbled 26.1%, although that was a sequential improvement from January's 36.4% plummet. As of Chipotle's update last month, comps in the first two weeks of March have been down more than 20%, according to a recent SEC filing.Shares lost support at their 50-day line at March 17. The stock has been trading below its 200-day line since late October, more than 40% off its August high of 758.61.All told, the food scares may cost Chipotle about three years of earnings growth, according to JPMorgan analyst John Ivankoe in an April 14 note, but same-store sales are ""set to sequentially improve from their Q1 2016 bottoms and ... the Street can start to focus on earnings recoverability.""Ivankoe upgraded the stock to overweight from neutral and boosted his price target to 510 from 465.Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh wrote that the firm has ""little doubt that CMG will return to positive (same-store sales) growth by Q4 2016 or Q1 2017,"" but he has an underweight rating and 375 price target on the stock for now.At this stage of the company's recovery from the crisis, some analysts have more questions than answers.""Beyond the overall sales commentary, there remain a significant number of questions the company must answer (albeit we believe many of these salient details will remain elusive, and we expect ongoing uncertainty to persist),"" said Deutsche Bank's Brett Levy, such as how long Chipotle will continue to ""over-spend"" on labor before sales pick up again, what new store productivity looks like and the company's market and promotional approach.Levy has a sell rating on Chipotle.""Despite the company’s long-term growth potential and historically high restaurant-level returns, CMG’s current issues are pressuring sales/earnings and represent risk to the shares,"" he wrote. ""We believe this limits the likelihood for any meaningful stock price recovery in the near term.""RELATED:Chipotle Shares Heat Up As JPMorgan Sees Comeback.

3177,CMG,"Wendy's (WEN) Wednesday reported first-quarter profit growth that was stronger than expected, lifted its full-year outlook and announced sweeping changes at its North American restaurants. But shares crashed on weak sales guidance.Meanwhile, Jack in the Box (JACK) -- dragged down during the regular session by Wendy's and a general consumer stock sell-off due to grim results from Walt Disney (DIS) and Fossil (FOSL) -- shot up late on better-than-expected earnings.Wendy's stock tumbled 8.9% to 10.19 in the stock market today, plunging through its 50-day line after the fast-food chain warned that second-quarter same-store sales at North American outlets  would be below its own target for 3% growth this year.Wendy's first-quarter adjusted earnings jumped 83% to 11 cents a share, trouncing views for 6 cents -- the third quarter in a row of better than expected earnings. Revenue dropped 19% to $378.8 million. Wall Street expected $352 million.The Q1 sales fall largely reflected a decline of 375 company-operated restaurants vs. a year earlier due to increased franchising. Same-restaurant sales increased 3.6% vs. the same quarter a year ago.Wendy's revised its full-year adjusted earnings outlook to 38-40 cents a share, up from its prior outlook for 35-37 cents. It also raised its outlook for 2016 adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or EBITDA, to a range of down 1% to up 1%. The outlook was for a drop of -2% to flat.The Dublin, Ohio-based company plans to sell 315 stores to franchisees this year as it moves toward its goal of having just 5% company-owned stores. Additionally, Wendy's and its franchisees will remodel 430 of the roughly 6,500 outlets in North America to draw more customers, and it will build 110 new restaurants.Wendy's Chief Executive Emil Brolick will retire on May 26 and be succeeded by current President and Chief Financial Officer Todd Penegor.After the market close, Jack in the Box said it earned 85 cents a share for its second quarter, up 23% vs. a year earlier. Sales rose slightly to $361.2 million.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected earnings to rise a penny to 70 cents a share and sales to rise fractionally to $360.2 million.Jack in the Box branded same-store sales were flat. Qdoba Mexican Eats, a rival to Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), had a systemwide comps gain of 2.1%, with a 3.1% rise for company-owned Qdoba locations.Shares sold off 5.2% to 65.14 during the regular session, then shot up 8% to 70.32 in after-hours action.

3178,CMG,"For some individual investors, big numbers trigger something akin to fear of heights. Looking at a stock that’s trading at a triple-digit price might seem like the view from a skyscraper's rooftop or glass floor.Yet just like acrophobia, the panic surrounding high-priced stocks is an irrational impulse.Such investors often feel safer buying low-priced stocks, which ironically have far more built-in problems.Step back and think about the triple-digit stock from two angles. First, an investor always has the 8% sell rule as protection. Second, no professional money manager shares this fear of triple-digit stocks. If a fund manager is spooked by price alone, he or she is in the wrong business.Big numbers alone have nothing to do with risk. Generally, little numbers actually carry more risk: They are often thinly traded stocks and lack institutional support. Thinly traded stocks are also more vulnerable to attacks from short sellers.So, if the best minds on Wall Street don’t want any part of a $2 stock, why should you? Likewise, if the best minds on Wall Street are selectively loading up on stocks trading in triple digits, why should you be afraid?The stock market operates in ways that are often counterintuitive. What seems like “common sense” to the novice investor is nonsense to the pro. The successful investor needs to get over fears that are not grounded in reality.This, by the way, is a major difference between an experienced investor or an accomplished professional and a novice. The situation that makes a veteran confident will scare a novice, while the situation that scares a veteran will enthuse a novice. Experience rewires emotions.The point here isn’t that an individual investor should buy a stock simply because the price is high. All we’re saying is this: Don’t rule out a stock because of price alone.On Sept. 1, 2010, the Nasdaq delivered a Day 4 follow-through, confirming that a market uptrend was underway. A number of quality stocks were trading in triple digits, and some broke out in the new uptrend.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) jumped about 6% on the follow-through day. The stock cleared a 154.53 buy point in volume 124% above average. The burrito and taco chain had grown earnings per share 67% in 2009 on a 14% sales gain to $1.52 billion. The stock rose 70% in three months. It peaked on Aug. 5, 2015, at 758.Netflix (NFLX) traded briefly within the 5% buy zone from a 124.10 double-bottom breakout price on the follow-through day. The buy zone was up to 130.31. From there, the stock advanced 60% in three months.Priceline Group (PCLN) also traded in the 5% buy zone on the follow-through day. The buy zone ran to roughly 295. The stock climbed about 90% in eight months.Apple (AAPL) broke out Sept. 9, 2010, clearing a double-bottom buy point at 266.09 -- initially in low trade, but volume picked up in the second half of the month. The stock delivered a 37% gain in five months.

3179,CMG,"Chipotle Mexican Grill's (CMG) is not expecting another loss in the second quarter after the fast-casual chain notched its first-ever quarterly loss on Tuesday.In avoiding a Q2 loss, the company cited fewer one-time costs, some expected recovery, and the expectation that Q2 is seasonally a better quarter. But April same-store sales so far are down 26%, minus the benefit of Easter, and are down 22% including Easter, management said during a conference call.Chipotle swung to a per-share loss of 88 cents during Q1, better than Wall Street expectations for a 95-cent per-share loss, but revenue fell short of forecasts as the troubled burrito chain says its sales are ""on a gradual path to recovery"" in the wake of several foodborne illness scandals.Shares fell 5% in late trade after edging up 0.6% during the regular trading session. The stock has been trading below its 200-day line since late October and broke support at the key 50-day level in mid-March.The troubled fast-casual chain said it gave away millions of free burritos and bowls in Q1, as it continued to woo diners still scared of setting foot in its restaurants. It will start offering more buy-one-get-one-free deals instead of freebie promotions as it moves forward with recovery plans.Revenue sank 23% to $834.5 million vs. views for $867.9 million. Same-store sales plunged 29.7%, below a Consensus Metrix forecast for a 28.4% drop and worse than the 14.6% decline in Q4. Sales from new restaurant openings -- 58 opened during the quarter -- offset the comps hit.""The signs seem to suggest the recovery isn’t taking place as quickly the market thought it might,"" Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy told IBD.To alleviate concerns over future food scares, Chipotle CEO Steve Ells said that changes have been made both at the supplier and restaurant levels, and that blanching is proving to be ""very effective."" Bell peppers have been added to the blanching program, he said, which means the vegetable can now be sliced in-restaurant instead of at a central kitchen. Lettuce is also now sliced in-house again.Restaurant-level operating margin fell to 6.8% from 27.5%. Food costs accounted for 35.3% of revenue, up 140 basis points from Q1 2015 on food-testing and waste expenses, as well as higher costs on pre-cut produce.The company's Q1 results sequentially follow a Q4 pockmarked by a 43% year-over-year profit decline and a 7% sales tumble, breaking a years-long string of double-digit quarterly growth.Chipotle did not offer guidance beyond 220-235 new restaurant openings and an effective full-year tax-rate of 38.4%.Meanwhile, another fast-casual chain, Panera Bread (PNRA), boosted its full-year profit guidance to $6.50-$6.70, up from $6.33-$6.52. The midpoint of the updated outlook exceeds current views for $6.55 a share.For the year, the company sees comparable net bakery-cafe sales growth of 4%-5% vs. a prior view for growth of 3.5%-4.5%.Q1 earnings, minus items, grew 11% to $1.56 a share on 6% revenue growth to $685.15 million. That topped analyst forecasts for $1.50 per share and $674.1 million in sales.Same-store sales at company-owned bakery-cafes rose 6.2% during the quarter. Franchise comps rose 3.3%. Systemwide comps grew 4.7% in Q1, said the company.Shares rose 2% later, after falling 1.5% in regular trade.Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) cut its full-year earnings outlook to $5.65-$5.85 from $5.95-$6.20, citing recent sales trends and an increasing outlook for traditional chicken wing costs.Analysts currently forecast $6.10 in per-share profit for the year.First-quarter earnings rose 13.5% to $1.73 per share, missing views by 4 cents. Revenue grew 15.4% to $508.3 million, well below forecasts of $530.3 million.

3183,CMG,"Savvy ETF investors just aren't willing to sit tight or ride out the bumps any more.A sharp uptick in volatility, global unrest and rate uncertainty has revived memories of the stock market busts of the early 2000s. Neither financial advisors nor the clients they serve relish the idea of getting burned again with an unwavering buy-and-hold approach.They want to get more tactical with their investing. That's where ETF strategists come in.These investing professionals put together the diversified, risk-managed strategies that today's investors increasingly seek. They're part of the reason iShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility (USMV) is a best-performing ETF this year, up 7.1% through May 12 vs. 1.8% for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY).Click Here To See A List Of Top-Performing ETFs In 2016Tactical ETF strategists champion a proactive response to shifting market currents. They seek to tilt investors' portfolios toward rising asset classes, while avoiding falling ones, according to CMG Capital, a thought leader in tactical investing with exchange traded funds.At the same time, they never lose sight of investors' long-term goals, whether it be buying a home or saving for retirement. They're not in the business of making speculative bets. Theirs is a considered approach to being tactical.CMG's chief and a couple of other investing pros recently sat down with IBD to discuss what tactical investing is and, just as importantly, what it isn't.IBD: Are you de-risking portfolios for 2016?Steve Blumenthal is chairman and CEO of Pennsylvania-based CMG Capital Management Group, which has $552 million in assets under advisement. CMG believes portfolios should be dynamically managed: We currently favor the following investment allocations: 30% to equities, 25% to fixed income and 45% to liquid alternatives. This is due to excessively high equity market valuations and ultra-low fixed income yields.Joe Ezernack is CEO and chief investment officer of Trademark Capital Management in Watkinsville, Ga.; $160 million in assets under management. Trademark focuses on portfolio management based upon appropriate and active adjustments in response to market change: Yes. We have made material tactical shifts in our portfolios to lower risk exposure.We lowered our exposure to index equity beta by exchanging it for smart beta ETFs like USMV and iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor (QUAL).We also added ultra-short-duration (bond) ETFs like Pimco Enhanced Short Maturity (MINT) and Guggenheim Enhanced Short Duration (GSY).Herb Morgan is founder, CEO and CIO of Efficient Market Advisors in San Diego, Calif.; AUM: $849 million. The firm describes itself as a strategic, tactical and opportunistic ETF strategist: De-risking implies reducing equity exposure. We think that is unwise today. The alternatives to equities are cash, which pays nothing, and fixed income, which pays nearly nothing. And fixed income carries large downside risk should rates rise more quickly than most people anticipate.From a tactical standpoint, we are overweight risk assets of equities and commodities. My overall investment allocation is to be overweight equities, underweight fixed income, near zero on cash, and a small weighting (0% to 10%) in inflation-sensitive assets such as commodities. Inflation is coming, and bonds are not the place to be.The entire world of central bankers and other policymakers are desperately trying to inflate, i.e., massive monetary stimulus. The debt burden globally is massive. Austerity is not politically expedient, so we will see inflation. Not the rip-your-face-off variety, but certainly above normal, above trend and above current expectations.Equities and commodities do well in this environment. It also means a return to growth -- yes, growth -- which today is anemic. I don’t invest for today, I invest for two to five years out, when I believe we will have a large growth burst globally.IBD: What does tactical investing mean to you?Blumenthal: We view tactical two ways:Trend-following compares the short-term price action of a security against the same security’s longer-term price trend. Comparing recent price action vs. a longer time period can help identify trends for all types of securities.Relative strength compares the price momentum of one security against another security or a select group of securities. The security with the strongest relative strength price momentum is selected. Sector rotation is a common relative strength investment strategy. Individual equities can be ranked to identify the strongest price leaders. For example, IBD posts a Relative Strength Ranking of all of the stocks it follows and ranks them by percentile. Relative strength seeks to identify the securities with the strongest price leadership and position accordingly.Ezernack: Tactical investing means providing an investor an emotional advantage over a traditional portfolio. We attempt to accomplish this by aligning a portfolio with the current market risk environment, within the boundaries of the portfolio objective. For a retiree, that may mean going fully defensive in bear market conditions. For an aggressive investor, that could mean tactical portfolio shifts with the goal of improved relative performance in changing market environments.Tactical investing is not a system to pick market tops or bottoms, nor is it a way to get rich quick.Morgan: Tactical investing is a bastardized term. In the textbook world, it means making moves within the confines of a policy statement, which is what we do. In recent years, however, the term tactical has been hijacked by charlatans who make false promises to investors that they can time the market. In fact, market timing failed miserably in the last decade and has now re-branded itself ""tactical."" That’s too bad because tactical has merits when properly implemented in the traditional, academic sense of finance textbooks.A good tactical move would have been to raise equity weights to 60% in early February, if you had a strategic target of 50% to equities, with a permitted range of 40% to 60%. Or within your permitted range to buy a beaten-down asset class. We bought Alerian MLP (AMLP) in late January and have since had a great return.Tactical investing is not market timing. How ridiculous is it to trust your life savings to a computer program that goes all in or all out of the markets?Our changes are measured and constrained; they are also based on fundamental analysis. The market timers are relying on signals that are created and refined to suit their desires. We evaluate both fundamentals and technicals. They rely only on technicals.IBD: What is working, and what hasn’t worked, in your portfolios lately?Blumenthal: Most recently, we’ve seen strong relative strength price leadership in iShares Latin America (ILF), Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO), SPDR Dow Jones REIT (RWR), Utilities Sector SPDR (XLU), Vanguard Materials (VAW) and Vanguard Information Technology (VGT).Fixed-income positions include Pimco 25+ Year Zero Coupon Treasury (ZROZ), iShares Emerging Market High Yield Bond (EMHY) and Pimco Enhanced Short Maturity Active.Ezernack: Low volatility has worked well for us this year. One standout position is iShares MSCI EAFE Minimum Volatility (EFAV), which has shown significant outperformance over its more traditional counterpart, Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets (VEA).In the same theme, traditional equity beta exposure hasn’t worked as well as our smart beta positions. For example, year to date our holdings in iShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility have performed better and, as the name implies, with less volatility than have our holdings in Vanguard S&P 500 (VOO).Morgan: So far 2016 has been very good for us.In equity, we are overweight international and emerging markets. All have done well. Domestically, our small- and midcap exposures are working.In fixed income, spreads in high yield and bank loans have narrowed, and we have been overweight there. We haven’t benefited from the drop in 10- to 20-year rates this year because we mostly have shorter-term or adjustable fixed-income ETFs in the portfolios.I have no regrets. Risk/reward is very bad on the long end of the duration/maturity curve. Even if it worked, the risk wasn’t worth the trade.In alternatives, we have benefited from MLP (master limited partnerships) and commodity positions.IBD: Is the traditional 60-40 stock-bond portfolio dead?Blumenthal: We believe the traditional 60/40 stock bond portfolio will not meet investor expectations over the coming 10 years. Due to the current high median price-to-earnings equity valuations, the 10-year forward annualized returns are likely to be in the low single digits. Expect just 2% to 4% before inflation. The same problem exists for fixed income. With the 10-year Treasury yielding less than 2%, the 10-year forward annualized returns will be less than 2% and close to 0% after factoring in inflation (assuming the Fed hits its inflation target mandate).We believe a broader portfolio mix that includes allocations to other return drivers, such as managed futures, global macro, long/short equity and tactical investment strategies, will create better diversification and better return opportunity. In this high equity valuation, low fixed-income yield environment, find strategies that may generate return yet do so in an unconstrained and uncorrelated way.The next recession will create a better buying opportunity for equities. For now, 60/40 is flat to dead.Ezernack: The traditional 60/40 portfolio’s effectiveness is being questioned primarily because fixed income is at the end of a long-term debt cycle. The end of the long-term debt cycle will likely bring a bad season for the 60/40 portfolio, however, it’s not its death. A favorable environment for the 60/40 portfolio will cycle back around. However, I would expect a continual evolution to the portfolio’s makeup.Smart beta, active, tactical and new styles of ETFs will continue to drive the evolution of the 60/40 portfolio. Yesterday’s 60% Vanguard S&P 500 (VOO) and 40% iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond (AGG) will not be the 60/40 portfolios that millennials will own.IBD: What’s the universe of ETFs you draw from?Blumenthal: Our CMG Opportunistic All Asset Strategy selects up to 11 ETFs from a broad universe, allocating to those showing the greatest potential to outperform the others in the selection universe.The ETFs considered include traditional style-box ETFs (large cap, midcap, small cap, value and growth), sector-specific ETFs, international developed and emerging market ETFs, various fixed-income ETFs, and gold and commodity-based ETFs such as REITs (real estate investment trusts) and MLPs. The ETFs demonstrating the strongest relative strength price leadership are selected and held for a defined period of time.(Editor's note: CMG Capital Management Group may have positions in the ETFs and mutual funds discussed in this piece.)Ezernack: We choose among the products whose underlying positions are liquid. We also select ETFs that have significant market liquidity and have good authorized participant access for larger trades.IBD: In what ways are you tactical, in what strategic, and in what opportunistic?Morgan: We are strategic in that we have long-range equity, fixed-income and alternative targets for investor portfolios. These are targets derived from their needs (age, time horizon, risk tolerance/aversion, personality etc.) We are tactical within the permitted ranges.Opportunistic is my favorite thing. This is 0% to 10% of our portfolio, where we take on a sector, industry or specific country ETF for a fundamental reason around valuation.For example, we bought SPDR S&P Homebuilders (XHB) when they were beaten down. We also picked up iShares U.S. Preferred Stock (PFF) and PowerShares Variable Rate Preferred (VRP) when people were worried that the banks were going to get nationalized.Opportunistic ideas are unique, real-time, unexpected and usually need to be acted on quickly. There can be sell opportunities as well, like when REITs were getting taken out via leveraged buyouts in 2007. The REIT valuations were sky-high, so we opportunistically sold iShares Cohen & Steers REIT (ICF) and Vanguard REIT (VNQ).

3184,CMG,"Stocks were mostly quiet as the regular trading session wrapped up Tuesday, but some big names got slammed after hours.The S&P 500 held an 0.2% gain, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 0.1%, and the Nasdaq gave up 0.2%. Volume swelled across the board vs. Monday, according to preliminary numbers.Car sellers, home furnishings retailers and energy stocks were among the top gainers in today’s stock market action. Oil stocks got a boost as West Texas intermediate crude bounced back up 3% to near $44 a barrel. Biotech, Internet and software stocks lagged.DuPont (DD) led the Dow with a 2% advance after its Q1 earnings topped estimates and the diversified giant raised its full-year outlook. Shares gapped up near a four-month high in above-average volume.Procter & Gamble (PG) was the biggest blue-chip loser, sliding more than 2% in heavy trade, close to a three-month low. The maker of Tide, Pampers and Olay reported fiscal Q3 earnings and revenue that beat views but fell 3% and 7%, respectively, from the same quarter a year earlier.Ethan Allan Interiors (ETH) led home furnishing retailers with an 11% spike in robust trade to its highest level in years. It reported better-than-expected fiscal Q3 results. Shares are now extended past a 32.20 cup-with-handle buy point.On the IBD 50, fashion house Michael Kors (KORS) rose 3%, while Universal Display (OLED) and discount chain Five Below (FIVE) each added 2%. Whirlpool (WHR) and Phillips 66 Partners (PSXP) underperformed, down 4% each.After the close, Apple (AAPL) crashed 7% after its fiscal Q2 results missed on both the top and bottom lines, and iPhone sales fell 16% to 51.2 million. Shares are poised to breach their 50-day moving average, where they closed during the regular session on an 0.7% decline.Also down late on earnings reports were Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), down 2%, and Twitter (TWTR), which plunged 11% on a revenue miss and soft Q2 outlook. However, eBay (EBAY) rose 2% after hours on an upside profit and sales surprise.On the economic front, March durable goods orders improved from February’s revised figures but fell well short of forecasts. The S&P/Case-Shiller home price index for February just missed views, as did consumer confidence for April.Economic reports due Wednesday include pending home sales for March and the weekly MBA mortgage applications and petroleum status report. The Fed will wrap up its two-day monetary policy meeting and will give a statement at 2 p.m. ET.Earnings are slated for Wednesday from Boeing (BA), Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL).

3185,CMG,"Apple (AAPL), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Reynolds American (RAI), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and Twitter (TWTR) report Tuesday. Here's what you need to know:The iPhone maker, which reports after the close on Tuesday, is expected to log a 14% per-share profit decline to $2 on a 10% revenue fall to $51.97 billion. Just how much iPhone sales will tumble from last year is on investors' minds ahead of the earnings report, with consensus at sales of 50 million units vs. the prior year's Q2 sales of 61.17 million iPhone units.Apple shares dipped 0.6% Monday but remain slightly above their 50-day line after losing support at the 200-day level on April 15.The first defense contractor to report, Lockheed Martin is expected to post a 5.5% decline in per-share earnings and a 12% revenue rise to $11.34 billion. Investors and analysts will closely inspect the performance of Sikorsky, a 2015 acquisition from United Technologies (UTX).Lockheed shares are attempting to break out after building a three-month-wide flat base with a 228.01 entry point. The stock edged down fractionally Monday to 226.30.The tobacco giant's earnings are seen growing 16% to 50 cents a share as revenue is expected to rise 42% to $2.93 billion, the latter of which would mark the third consecutive quarter of more-than-40% sales growth.Reynolds American, a major dividend stock, closed the day up 1.2% to 48.41 but has yet to retake its 50-day line after slicing below that key support level in mid-April.Wall Street sees the social network's profit rising 43% to a dime a share. Revenue is also expected to grow in the double digits, with 39% projected growth to $607.8 million. A slowdown in Twitter user growth over the last four straight quarters has prompted analyst caution.Facebook (FB) and LinkedIn (LNKD) follow on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.Twitter shares fell 0.8% to 17.09 on Monday, closing back below its 200-day moving average.A first-ever quarterly loss is expected of the beleaguered fast-casual chain, as analysts broadly predict a 95-cent per-share loss, slightly better than Chipotle Mexican Grill's prior guidance for a $1 ""or worse"" per-share loss but a wild swing from last year's $3.88 in per-share profit.Analysts anticipate a 19% revenue drop to $880.2 million.A big question is how quickly Chipotle is winning back its legions of fans. Chipotle's guidance will be especially critical.Shares gained 0.1%, ending Monday at 443.10.Fast-casual peer Panera Bread (PNRA) and sports bar chain Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) also are set to report earnings late Tuesday.RELATED:How Much Will iPhone Sales Fall In Apple’s March Quarter?Will Twitter Show A Reversal In User Declines With Q1 Earnings?Here’s What To Expect From Chipotle EarningsWhat To Expect When Lockheed Martin Kicks Off Defense Earnings

3187,CMG,"Investors will get a chance to see how much more sizzle McDonald’s (MCD) can add to its stock price this week when the fast-food king reports first-quarter earnings.The iconic burger chain is already one of the restaurant industry’s top performers this year, with a stock price trading near record highs and an aggressive growth plan that includes a big expansion in Asia.Now all all eyes will be on McDonald’s Q1 results, due Friday morning. Industry watchers expect another strong quarter, at least on the bottom line.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters look for McDonald’s to log a 15% year-over-year earnings gain to $1.16 a share, which would be the third straight quarter of double-digit EPS growth. That hasn’t happened in more than four years.The top-line forecast is a little muddier. McDonald’s overall revenue is seen dipping 3% to $5.8 billion for the quarter, which would be the sixth straight quarter of lower revenue.However, same-store sales growth — a more important industry metric — has been strong. Most analysts see McDonald’s Q1 U.S. comps up 4% to 4.5%.During the 2015 fourth quarter, McDonald’s posted a 5.7% increase in same-store sales, well above consensus. Earnings rose 16% to $1.31 a share, topping forecasts by 8 cents. Sales fell 4% to $6.34 billion, but still topped views for $6.2 billion.The company’s recent financial turnaround is partly the result of success with its all-day breakfast menu, which debuted in the fall. Its McPick 2 for $2 deal, an alternative to the Dollar Menu, didn’t fare as well. It was later replaced by the McPick 2 for $5, which has performed better.""While the McPick 2 for $2 and industry conditions were relatively weak in January, McPick 2 for $5, along with ongoing strength from All Day Breakfast, have bolstered sales trends in March,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer noted in a recent report. ""We believe that the McPick 2 value brand will be one of several reasons that McDonald’s can sustain (same-store sales momentum).""Meanwhile, McDonald’s said it will begin selling Johnsonville Brats again after a seven-year hiatus, perhaps in response to a recent move by rival Burger King to sell hot dogs.Starting April 25, brats will return to menus at 125 McDonald’s locations in southeast Wisconsin, according to news reports.Another potential growth driver is McDonald’s big expansion in Asia. It recently announced plans to add more than 1,500 locations in China, Hong Kong and South Korea over the next five years. It already has more than 2,800 locations in those markets, most of which are company owned. This time McDonald’s is looking for ""strategic partners"" to help in its Asia expansion.""This will allow McDonald's to accelerate our growth and scale faster across diverse markets, placing us closer to our customers and the communities we serve,"" CEO Steve Easterbrook said in a statement. ""We're in the midst of transforming our business and taking a strategic and thoughtful approach to enhance our ability to grow around the world. These actions build on our turnaround efforts and will advance local ownership, enable faster decision making and achieve restaurant growth.""Wall Street seems happy with McDonald’s direction. The company’s stock price set a new high of 128.90 on Monday and is up about 9% since the beginning of the year. McDonald's ended virtually unchanged Tuesday.That’s part of an overall rebound in fast-food stocks. Taco Bell parent Yum Brands (YUM) has risen around 13% for 2016; Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) is up 10%; and Wendy’s (WEN) has risen about 2%.Meanwhile, shares of fast-casual stocks such as Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Shake Shack (SHAK) and Habit Restaurants (HABT) have struggled.

3188,CMG,"Starbucks (SBUX) should post another quarter of double-digit earnings and revenue gains, analysts project, but will a good second quarter be good enough for investors?The coffee shop chain is expected to post 18% profit growth to 39 cents a share on a 10% revenue rise to $5.03 billion, when it reports results after the close Thursday.Shares have been consolidating since November, largely trading above their 50-day and 200-day moving averages for the last month. Starbucks shares rose 0.6% to 60.89  in the stock market today.IBD's Take: How healthy are the shares of Starbucks and its rivals? Find out at IBD Stock Checkup""We continue to view SBUX as a best-in-class operator and an industry leader in the increasingly important realm of technology-driven consumer engagement,"" wrote Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh on Monday. He has an equal-weight rating and 56 price target on the stock.Starbucks' rewards program boasted 11.1 million active U.S. members as of January, with its mobile app accounting for over a fifth of all domestic transactions and with its order-ahead feature also picking up steam.Consensus estimates for domestic same-store sales and global comps are 7% and 6.5%, respectively, according to his report.Piper Jaffray, which noted in its semiannual teen survey last week that Starbucks was still No. 1 with young people, said its latest channel checks leave the firm ""confident that Starbucks is well-positioned to continue driving strong same-store sales trends in 2016,"" citing well-received food and drink offerings and targeted promotions.But with expectations high for the coffee titan, a solid quarterly report may not impress.""(E)ven if Starbucks reports good results -- based on lofty investors’ expectations -- the shares may still face some added pressure, as good results may not be good enough to support SBUX’s shares at current levels,"" wrote Deutsche Bank analyst Brett Levy on Friday. He has a hold rating on the stock.Starbucks is a member of IBD's Retail-Restaurants industry group, which includes Dunkin' Brands (DNKN), McDonald's (MCD), Taco Bell parent Yum Brands (YUM) and the beleaguered Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG).Yum is slated to report Wednesday.

3189,CMG,"Chipotle Mexican Grill’s (CMG) series of food-borne illness outbreaks may have cost the company three years of earnings growth, according to JPMorgan’s estimates. But the bank sounded bullish as it upgraded the beleaguered restaurant chain to overweight from neutral.""In all, our call is based on Chipotle being a highly meaningful brand that with time and expense can regain customer trust,"" wrote JPMorgan analyst John Ivankoe on Thursday.Shares closed 2.55% higher but remain below their 50-day moving average. The stock has been trading below its 200-day since losing support at the level in late October, and is 40% off its all-time high.The E. coli and norovirus episodes that hit Chipotle locations across the country also hit its brand image, with same-store sales down 14.6% in Q4 and an expected loss in Q1, the latter of which would mark a first for the company’s quarterly results.""We expect normal earnings growth to resume by F18 -- after nearly doubling in F17 -- and believe 20%+ EPS growth can be sustained through at least F20,"" said Ivankoe.He is not the only analyst who sees the light at the end of the tunnel for the burrito chain.Piper Jaffray’s latest semiannual teen survey found that Chipotle still holds major sway over America’s young people. The firm is positive on the company’s long-term story as well, with an overweight rating and 590 price target.The stock is a member of IBD’s Retail-Restaurants industry group, which is at No. 75 among IBD’s Industry Sub-Group Rankings, joined by Starbucks (SBUX), McDonald's (MCD), Yum Brands (YUM) and others.RELATED:Starbucks Is Still Tops With Teens, Chipotle Hangs OnWhy Chipotle Mexican Grill May Have Reached ‘Peak Burrito’

3190,CMG,"Today’s Investor’s Corner kicks off a short series of articles detailing why some breakouts fail and how to handle them when they do.Teen retail chain Rue 21 staged what looked like a very solid breakout on July 7, 2011, (1) (a weekly chart is shown). The five-month cup with handle was just 23% deep. The base was a first-stage pattern, and the stock had been public for less than two years, also a plus.But some red flags were waving.Institutional activity over the course of the base was skewed toward distribution. This activity rippled into the handle (2). The volume, rather than drying up along the length of the handle, was jerky, with heavier weekly volume on the downside. This isn’t the kind of orderly shakeout you like to see ahead of a breakout.The handle also dipped nearly 15%, beyond the 12% limit that defines a well-behaved stock.The breakout, a powerful 8% spike in better than double its average trade, past a 34.93 buy point, did not erase these elements of risk.Rue rose for two days, then began a rapid pullback in generally light trade. It dropped to a test of 50-week support, violating the 8% sell rule on July 27 (3). Technically, this marked a failed breakout.In real terms, the breakout still had a fighting chance. A great many breakouts -- particularly in a challenging market -- have pulled back below the 8% loss level, then reversed to retake the buy point and move on to new highs.Recent examples include Hi Tech Pharmacal and Starbucks (SBUX) in September and October. More recently, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Nu Skin Enterprises (NUS) and W.W. Grainger (GWW) have recovered after triggering the golden sell rule to retake new highs.The lesson: Keep your eye on the ball, even if it has failed.Rue’s death knell came in the first two sessions of August 2011 (4). The stock cut its 50-day moving average with a big loss in mildly above-average trade Aug. 1. On Aug. 2, it sliced its 200-day line with an even larger drop in heavier volume.(Editor's Note: This column first ran on Investors.com on Jan. 6, 2012.)

3194,CMG,"All-day breakfast and adjustments in food-prep helped McDonald's (MCD) beat fourth-quarter estimates Monday, indicating that the fast-food mainstay’s strategy to compete with newer alternatives is working.U.S. comparable sales, a figure considered pivotal to the company's rebound efforts from years past, surged 5.7%. That figure was far above Wall Street forecasts for around 3% growth and marked a second consecutive quarterly increase after two years of declines. Milder weather during the quarter also helped.""We are demonstrating that our turnaround plan is key to restarting growth and becoming a modern and progressive burger company,"" said CEO Steve Easterbrook, who took over last March and launched all-day breakfast in October.In a statement, he later added: ""As we enter 2016, we expect continued positive top-line momentum across all segments.""Shares closed up 0.7% Monday after climbing as much as 3% earlier to touch an intraday high. The stock has rallied more than 30% from a year ago.McDonald's earnings per share during Q4 jumped 16% from a year earlier to $1.31, topping forecasts by 8 cents. Sales fell 4% to $6.34 billion. But the decline, weighed by the strong dollar, wasn't as bad as expected. Analysts had modeled a slip in sales to $6.2 billion.Globally, comps rose 5%. In the company's high-growth markets, operating income jumped 27%, helped by an easier comparison in China, where the company suffered from a food safety scare in 2014 after a supplier sold expired meat to McDonald's and Yum Brands' (YUM) KFC.McDonald's management said on an earnings call that it's mulling a sale of part of its stake in the company's struggling Japan business and plans to open 250-plus restaurants in China this year. In Australia, all-day breakfast will launch nationwide this quarter, the company said.As part of its new approach, McDonald's has embraced more natural ingredients, offered deals through its mobile app, and experimented with customizable burgers. But it was all-day breakfast that dominated the discussion -- and the U.S. comp growth.""Our guess is this result implies the chain outperformed the fast-food industry by about three (percentage points),"" RBC Capital Markets said in a research note. ""While input costs have started to turn favorable for McDonald’s (and projected to be down 1-2% in 2016), we believe that All Day Breakfast was also a contributor to lower cost-of-goods percentages.""Company-operated restaurant expenses fell 7% during the quarter. Breakfast items are generally cheaper as they relate to cost of sales, noted Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh, and beef costs have dropped as cattle herds expand.He also pointed to other changes that likely contributed to the rebound, such as searing beef patties better, toasting buns just before giving burgers to customers, and making the menu board more efficient.""I think there’s been a number of operational improvements that they’ve done that have been mostly behind the scenes,"" Slabaugh told Investor's Business Daily.McDonald's Q4 success comes after years of struggles for the chain, which had suffered as more diners, seeking fresher, higher-quality fare, flocked to fast-casual outlets like Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG).But Chipotle has had problems of its own, namely a food-borne illness outbreak last year that has forced the company into damage control. Shares of other fast-casual chains and fast-food rivals have also drifted lower, while McDonald's shares have risen in recent weeks.Chipotle stock closed down 1.9% Monday and has plunged more than 40% since October. Once high-flying Shake Shack (SHAK) has tumbled 59% from its peak.Shares of Yum Brands, Burger King parent Restaurant Brands (QSR), Wendy’s (WEN) and Jack In The Box (JACK) have lost ground too.Piper Jaffray analyst Nicole Miller Regan noted that some rivals in the sector are only now starting to tweak their strategies, while McDonald's is putting its own in place.""They spent the last 12-plus months creating strategy, and now they’re executing,"" she told IBD.

3195,CMG,"The so-called Texas economic miracle inspires belief or skepticism, depending on who’s singing from the hymnal.The amen corner can point to the state’s lack of an income tax. Skeptics can point to property taxes, which are higher than 33 states, according to the Tax Foundation.Stock market investors have a third take on Texas, and it might be worth more money than all the fighting over taxes combined.The Lone Star state regularly launches an abundance of initial public offerings. Sometimes that leads to breakouts and big price gains.In the past five years, 679 companies in IBD’s database launched IPOs.Texas accounted for 92 of the IPOs, or almost 14%. (Only California had more, 179 or 26% of the total.)Almost half of the Texas IPOs were in the energy sector. Oil companies are hurting big time now, but two stocks did fairly well before the sector crumbled.Sanchez Energy (SN), a December 2011 IPO, had breakouts that brought 25% and 18% gains before the stock headed down with the oil sector.Diamondback Energy (FANG), an October 2012 IPO, had post-breakout gains of 28%, 63% and 59% before turning south.Retail played a big role among Texas IPOs in the past five years. Individual investors, though, often needed well-timed entries and sell rules to take advantage.Francesca’s (FRAN), a July 2011 IPO, had a 37% gain from a March 2012 breakout, but then became a downward-sloping story.Zoe’s Kitchen (ZOES), a 2014 IPO, stirred speculation that it might become the next Chipotle (CMG). The stock formed some bases, but most led to little upside. The best gain was out of a June 2015 breakout that yielded a 30% profit.Dave & Buster’s Entertainment (PLAY), a 2014 IPO, offered its initial entry in a bounce off the 10-week line in December 2014. The stock logged an 84% gain from the 10-week line.Other retail IPOs, the debut year and their breakout gains include: Chuy’s Holdings (CHUY), 2012, 24% and 26%; and Michaels Companies (MIK), a 2014 IPO, gained 45% from a November 2014 gap up.Some Texas-based IPOs, such as La Quinta (LQ), a hotel chain that debuted on the NYSE in 2014, never found the big breakout gain. La Quinta’s breakouts led to modest gains. Others brought mostly frustration. The Container Store (TCS) debuted in 2013 amid lots of financial media attention. The stock formed a short IPO base and gained about 27% after the breakout. However, the overall trend since has been down.Sometimes a stock will stage several breakouts that go nowhere before getting it right.After its IPO in November 2013, LGI Homes (LGIH) rose and then offered breakouts (1) that led to small gains in January 2014 (not shown on chart), July 2014 and June 2015. In August 2015, a breakout (2) led to a 78% gain in four months.

3196,CMG,"A year ago, you would have been hard pressed to make a case that fast-food restaurant chains such as McDonald's and Wendy's were better bets for investors than trendy fast-casual outlets like Chipotle Mexican Grill. That's a much easier sell today, given the beating Chipotle has taken, following E. coli and norovirus outbreaks at a number of its eateries, as…

3197,CMG,"Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) met analysts’ expectations on earnings, but failed to meet the same on revenues in third-quarter fiscal 2017 results.Apart from impressive third-quarter earnings, Starbucks made another major announcement. First, Starbucks announced plans of buying the remaining 50% stake in its East China business for $1.3 billion in cash, the company’s largest ever acquisition, as it continues to look to China as one of the main growth area. The addition gives Starbucks full ownership of about 1,300 Starbucks locations in Shanghai as well as Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces.However, the premium coffee giant also shared plans of closing its Teavana outlets (379 stores, 3,300 employees) after buying it in 2012.Despite Starbucks’ expansion plans, its shares fell 5.8% in after-hours trading session on Jul 27. The pessimism was possibly due to the soft guidance for fiscal 2017.Starbucks Chief Financial Officer Scott Maw, said, “The combination of trends in the quarter and ongoing macro pressures impacting the retail and restaurant sectors has us a bit more cautious.”Earnings, Sales & Comps DiscussionAdjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 55 cents was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, but grew 12.2% year over year.Total second-quarter sales of $5.66 billion increased 8.1% year over year, driven by higher store openings and global comps growth. The upside was driven by robust sales in the U.S. and the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) divisions.Revenues, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.74 billion by 1.4%.Global same-store sales (comps) grew 4%, better than the 3% growth witnessed in the preceding quarter. Global traffic increased 4% in the quarter against 3% decline in traffic in the previous quarter. Margin JumpsOperating margin decreased 110 basis points (bps) year over year to 18.4% in the quarter due to goodwill and store asset impairments. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin advanced 100 bps to 20.8%.Segment DetailsAmericas: Net revenue in this flagship segment increased 10% year over year to $3.99 billion.Comps rise of 5% in the quarter was better than 3% last quarter. U.S. comps grew 5%, comprising 5% increase in average ticket.The company’s core beverage contributed 2% to comps growth in the U.S. Core coffee and espresso and core beverages contributed 2% of comps. Food sales contributed 2 points and innovation beverages contributed 1% to comps growth in the quarter. Overall, 3% of comps growth came from beverage, while 2% from food.Membership increased 8% year over year in the My Starbucks Rewards (MSR) program in the quarter. Customers in the U.S. are using the chain’s mobile app to order and pay for their drinks and are joining the company’s rewards program. Mobile payments represented 30% of U.S. transactions, increasing from 9% a year ago.Operating margin in the segment, however, contracted 20 bps to 24.4% as strong sales leverage were more than offset by higher investments in store partners, the impact of product sales mix and higher commodity costs.China-Asia-Pacific (CAP): Net revenue increased 9% to $840.6 million on the back of higher revenues from new store opening and comp store sales growth.Comps grew 1%, softer than 3% growth seen in the previous quarter. Stellar 7% comps growth in China were partly offset by softness in Japan.Starbucks’ licensed joint venture markets, including East China and South Korea, continue to contribute to CAP's performance in the quarter, as evidenced by a 30% increase in income from joint ventures.Operating margin at the CAP segment rose 280 bps year over year to 26.6% buoyed by strong sales leverage and higher JV income.Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA): Net revenue declined 9% year over year to $249.9 million due to portfolio shift to licensed stores, including the sale of the Germany outlet as well as due to currency headwind.That said, comps grew 2% (against 1% decline in the preceding quarter), marking the strongest growth in seven quarters, banking on solid U.K. performance.Operating margin declined 700 bps to 3.9%, owing to a shift in the portfolio toward more licensed stores and partial impairment of goodwill for its Switzerland market.Channel Development (CPG): This segment includes roasted whole bean and ground coffees, premium Tazo teas, a variety of ready-to-drink beverages (like Frappuccino and Starbucks Refreshers) and Starbucks and Tazo branded K-Cup packs sold through channels such as grocery, specialty retailers, and foodservice, to name a few.Channel Development’s net revenues were up 9% to $478.7 million.Operating margin rose 130 bps to 43.9% driven by higher profits from the North American Coffee Partnership (NCAP) with PepsiCo, Inc, (PEP) and lower coffee costs.All-Other: The segment comprises emerging brands like Teavana (acquired in Dec 2012), Seattle's Best Coffee, Starbucks Reserve and Roastery businesses. Revenues at the segment decreased 9% to $100.4 million.Q4 GuidanceFor the fourth quarter, Starbucks projected global comp growth at 3% to 4%.GAAP EPS will be in the range of 53–54 cents and non-GAAP EPS will be in the range of 54–55 cents.Fiscal 2017 GuidanceGiven the “choppiness” it witnessed in the fiscal third quarter as well as in the initial fourth quarter, Starbucks now is somewhat bearish for the remainder of fiscal 2017.The company now expects revenue growth to be at the low end of its prior guidance range of 8–10%. This excludes 1% from Fx and 2% of impact for the extra week in fiscal 2016.For fiscal 2017, the company cut its non-GAAP earnings target to the range of $1.96???$1.97 from $2.08–$2.12 per share expected earlier.

3198,CMG,"Shares of Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. (DNKN  -  Free Report) were up nearly 2% in the trading session on Jul 27, after the company reported mixed second-quarter 2017 results. While, the bottom line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the top line lagged the same.Earnings and Revenues DiscussionAdjusted earnings of 64 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents by 3.2% and increased 12.3% year over year. This upside was mainly owing to better margins, offset by an increase in shares outstanding.Dunkin' Brands’ revenues in the quarter increased 1% year over year to $218.5 million. The improvement was on the back of a rise in royalty income as well as a boost in rental income. But it was also partly offset by a decrease in sales at company-operated restaurants and decline in sales of ice cream and other products, particularly in the Middle East, along with decrease in other revenues. Moreover, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $219.6 million by 0.5% in the reported quarter.Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. QuoteInside the Headline NumbersDunkin' Brands operates through its Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin-Robbins brands.The company’s system-wide sales increased 4.6% in-line with the 4.6% growth recorded in the prior quarter.Dunkin’ DonutsDunkin' Donuts U.S. reported revenues of $157.1 million, which reflects an increase of 2.2% over the prior-year quarter. The upside was attributable to higher royalty income and rental income as well as an increase in franchise fees, partly offset by a decrease in sales at company-operated restaurants and a decline in other revenues.Comps increased 0.8% in the Dunkin Donuts U.S. division comparing favorably with 0.5% growth in the prior-year quarter, and flat comps in the preceding quarter.But, comps at Dunkin’ Donuts International division decreased 2.8% compared with 3.1% decline in the prior-year quarter. In fact, the figure compared unfavorably with the decline of 0.2% in the preceding quarter.Baskin RobbinsBaskin-Robbins U.S. revenues were up 4.4% from the prior-year quarter to $10.6 million. The uptick in revenues was primarily owing to an increase in royalty income and an improvement in sales of ice cream and other products.However, comps decreased 0.9% in the Baskin Robbins U.S. division comparably weaker than 0.6% growth in the year-ago quarter but better than the 2.4% decline in the prior quarter.At Baskin Robbins International division, comps grew 3.3%, better than the 6.6% slump in the prior-year quarter and the 2.0% decline in the prior quarter.Operating MarginAdjusted operating income rose 6.9% from the prior-year quarter to $118.9 million mainly backed by an increase in royalty income as well as rental margin, and a decrease in general and administrative expenses. The upside was partly offset by a decrease in other revenues. Meanwhile, adjusted operating income margin was up  290 basis points to 54.4%.Store UpdateIn the reported quarter, Dunkin' Brands opened 133 net new restaurants worldwide. These include 64 net new Dunkin' Donuts U.S. locations, offset by the closure of one Dunkin' Donuts international outlet. In fact, there were 12 net new openings under the Baskin-Robbins U.S. division and 58 net new Baskin-Robbins International outlets.Additionally, Dunkin' Donuts U.S. franchisees remodeled 114 restaurants, while Baskin-Robbins U.S. franchisees renovated 19 outlets.Guidance for 2017For 2017, Dunkin’ Brands continues to expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.40 to $2.43 and maintains the projection of mid-to-high single-digit growth in adjusted operating income.Also, the company continues to anticipate low-to-mid single-digit revenue growth. Additionally, it projects low-single-digit comps growth for Dunkin' Donuts U.S., in line with previous expectation.Notably, it now expects slightly negative comp sales for Baskin-Robbins U.S. (comparing unfavorably with the previous expectation of low-single-digit growth).Currently, Dunkin’ Brands carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

3199,CMG,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 earnings per share (EPS) of $2.32, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.16 by 7.4%. The figure also increased significantly from the prior-year quarter earnings of 87 cents, given a substantial rise in revenues.Total revenue rose 17.1% from the year-ago quarter to $1.17 billion driven by new restaurant openings and solid comps growth. However, revenues missed the consensus mark of $1.18 billion by over 1%.Notably, the company’s shares rallied nearly 2% in afterhours trading on Jul 25, in response to the solid bottom-line performance and improved comps.Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. QuoteBehind the Headline NumbersComps grew 8.1% in the quarter. The increase was mainly on the back of improved customer traffic, along with an increase in average check given reduced promotional activity. However, the comps rise was lower than the prior-quarter growth of 17.8%.Meanwhile, food costs, as a percentage of revenues, decreased 10 bps to 34.1% given reduction in food waste, improvements in the company’s food safety procedures, lower paper and packaging costs as well as benefit of menu price increases in select restaurants, somewhat offset by higher avocado prices.General and administrative expenses comprised 6% of the total revenue, reflecting a decrease of 110 bps year over year, chiefly due to sales leverage.Restaurant level operating margin was 18.8%, up 330 bps from 15.5% recorded in the year-ago quarter. The upside was primarily driven by sales leverage coupled with more efficient scheduling and deployment of the company’s managers and crew.Marketing and promotional expenses, as a percentage of revenues, decreased 70 bps to 3.7% due to lower promotional costs and sales leverage.Guidance for 2017Chipotle reiterated its previously announced guidance for full-year 2017 as comps are still projected to increase in high single digits. Meanwhile, new restaurant openings are anticipated in the range of 195–210.Currently, the company expects G&A to be in the $290 million range for the year, slightly lower than previous guidance of $300 million.It is also working toward its stretch goal of achieving adjusted earnings per share of $10.00 and restaurant level operating margin of 20% for the year.Our Take2017 has been sort of a turnaround year for the company so far. Finally, sales have started bouncing back from the massive food safety scandal related to the E.coli and norovirus outbreak, which surfaced toward 2015-end and resulted in sales plunging and hurting its reputation.Continued focus on food safety, simplification of restaurant operations, menu innovation, enhancing digital orders and increased brand marketing should drive growth, going forward.However, the recent closure of a Washington-area outlet due to an apparent norovirus alert has started a fresh round of food-safety scare. Evidence of rodents was found at a Dallas outlet, further adding to the woes.Zacks Rank & Upcoming ReleasesChipotle has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Among other firms in the restaurant space, BJ's Restaurants, Inc.

3200,CMG,"AT&T (T  -  Free Report) reported Q2 earnings moments after the closing bell today, topping estimates on both and top and bottom lines. Earnings of 79 cents per share beat the Zacks consensus by 5 cents, and sales of $39.84 billion narrowly edged out the $39.80 billion expected. Improved churn performance and 2.8 million wireless net adds helped bolster Q2 results. CEO Randall Stephenson mentioned that the Time Warner  merger remains on course to close by the end of 2017.

T.I. posted $1.03 per share, above the 95 cents anticipated, on quarterly revenues of $3.69 billion, breezing past the $3.56 billion in the Zacks consensus. Earnings growth of more than 35% and sales growth of 18% year over year spurred the big beat after the bell today. CEO Rich Templeton credited growth in the autos and industrials markets for the quarterly outperformance.U.S. Steel (X  -  Free Report) blew the doors off its earnings estimate, reporting $1.07 per share compared to what was expected to be 40 cents and rebounding strongly from a bottom-line loss in Q2 2016. Sales of $3.14 billion topped the $2.98 billion in the Zacks consensus, up 15% year over year.

Growth in Macau was up 6.8% year over year to $682.7 million in the quarter. These stronger Macau numbers may have been priced in to the stock, which was up 17% over the past 3 months and +40% year to date, as the stock is down more than 2% in post-report late trading.Finally, Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report) fought through another quarter rife with negative headlines to outperform expectations on the bottom line: $2.32 per share improved over the $2.16 estimate, which itself was a nearly 150% gain from a year ago. Revenues missed estimates slightly, reporting sales of $1.17 billion compared to the $1.18 billion estimate. Comps of 8.1% were lower than expected (Q2 2016 was a particularly rough quarter for Chipotle), as the company dealt with norovirus and rat issues in the recent past.

3203,CMG,"The Q2 earnings season has started off on an encouraging note with multiple companies reporting better earnings and revenue growth compared with the last few quarters.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for the 97 S&P 500 members that have reported results (as of Jul 21) are up 8.4% from the year-ago period, courtesy of a 5.1% rise in revenues. Notably, 78.4% of the companies that have posted their quarterly numbers have surpassed earnings estimates, while 72.2% have exceeded top-line expectations.Restaurant Stocks in FocusThe restaurant industry belongs to the broader Retail-Wholesale sector and the space is expected to deliver mixed performance this earnings season. Overall Q2 earnings for the sector are expected to be down 0.2% year over year, though revenues are expected to rise 3.9%.It is to be noted that the restaurant industry’s sales trends in recent quarters have been very challenging, given soft consumer spending on dining out, which has resulted in low consumption. Declining comps due to sluggish traffic trends along with rising costs, are thus taking the sheen out of restaurant companies. Nevertheless, the to-be-reported quarter is set to witness improvement over the recent quarters, given improving economic indicators, such as growing income and solid employment numbers.Evidently, on one hand, the second quarter of 2017 marked the sixth consecutive quarter of negative comparable sales (comps) for the restaurant industry as a whole, per TDn2K’s Black Box Intelligence. On the other hand, the quarter posted the best results for the industry since the second quarter of 2016.Notably, besides improving economic conditions, easy year-over-year comparisons also seem to have aided the results.Thus, though the overall scenario is still bordering on the negative and the earnings picture also seems to be less enticing, innovative operators with strong fundamentals are likely to continue exhibiting strength even in a not-so-favorable environment, and are expected to fare well this earnings season. Three restaurant companies are set to report their second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 25. Will these companies manage to put up a decent performance? Let’s take a look at what might be in store for these companies:McDonald's Corp. (MCD  -  Free Report) pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 11.36%. In fact, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last eleven quarters, with the trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise coming in at 7.01%.McDonald's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  McDonald's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | McDonald's Corporation QuoteNotably, our proven model shows that an earnings beat is likely for McDonald's this time around. This is because the company has the right combination of the two key ingredients – a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better and a positive Earnings ESP – to increase its odds of an earnings surprise.For the quarter, McDonald’s has an Earnings ESP of +0.62% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line is pegged at $1.62. Global comps at McDonald’s have been positive for the last seven quarters, marking a trend that is likely to continue in Q2 as well. Still, soft industry growth could somewhat hurt sales, whereas negative currency translation might dent the quarter’s profits (read more: McDonald's Buckles Up for Q2 Earnings: A Beat in Store?).Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report) came up with a positive earnings surprise of 25.00% in the last quarter. However, the trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise is a negative 8.59%.Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. QuoteWe note that Chipotle is unlikely to post a beat in the quarter due to the combination of its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and Earnings ESP of -2.32%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings is pegged at $2.16.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Chipotle’s new brand-management efforts, along with various sales-building should drive its top- and bottom–line performance in the quarter. However, costs associated with marketing and promotional initiatives to connect with its customers, implementation of food safety measures and higher labor expenses are likely to thwart the quarter’s profitability. Meanwhile, overall choppiness in the U.S. restaurant space is likely to limit revenue growth (read more: Chipotle to Report Q2 Earnings: Will it Disappoint?).Domino's Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 8.62% in the previous quarter. In fact, the company pulled off positive earnings surprises in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 6.04%.Domino's Pizza Inc Price and EPS Surprise  Domino's Pizza Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Domino's Pizza Inc QuoteThe company has an Earnings ESP of -0.82% and a Zacks Rank #3, thereby making it difficult to conclusively predict an earnings beat this quarter. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's  bottom line is pegged at $1.22. Domino's solid brand positioning should continue to boost sales in the to-be-reported quarter. In fact, initiatives on the digital front, focus on re-imaging and other sales boosting strategies are expected to help sustain the comps momentum. Yet, higher costs and negative currency translation are likely to hurt profits while soft industry backdrop might restrict revenue growth.Stay tuned!

3204,CMG,"Earnings season is in full bloom, as numerous publicly traded companies continue to release their latest earnings reports, which are providing investor with fresh updates on consumer tendencies, economic conditions, and company specific financial outlooks.However, it is extremely easy to become lost in all the different earnings and financial releases over the next month. Luckily, Zacks readers can utilize the Zacks Earnings Calendar in order to keep track of specific earnings releases, dividend announcements, and other vital news than can have a large impact on portfolios.Using the Earnings Calendar, we are looking ahead to next week to target the most important upcoming reports. Check out these four companies that are expected to release an earnings report during the week of July 24:Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report)) – Monday, July 24 – After Market CloseTechnology behemoth Alphabet Inc., formerly known as Google, is expected to release its quarterly earnings report after the closing bell on July 24. Our Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for revenue of $20.83 billion and earnings of $8.20 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 18.86% and 17.18%, respectively.A recent market share report showed that Google holds a 72.5% share of the global search engine market, and the company continues to expand outside of its traditional search business. The stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), but with an Earnings ESP of -2.56%, we can’t be overly confident of a beat this quarter. Nevertheless, Alphabet surprised earnings projections last quarter and will look to continue that momentum.  Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report)) – Tuesday, July 25 – After Market CloseFast-casual giant Chipotle Mexican Grill will release its quarterly earnings report after the market closes on July 25. The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects revenue of $1.19 billion and earnings of $2.17 per share, which would signify impressive year-over-year growth of 18.70% and 149.14%, respectively. However, investors should note that the prior-year quarter was impacted by the company’s massive food-safety scandal, so these comparisons don’t paint the full picture.Chipotle has continued efforts to reconnect with lost customers after the company received negative publicity from its food-borne illness outbreak. These efforts to retrieve trust and loyalty from customers have increased costs of marketing and promotions, which have greatly strained the company’s profitability. Chipotle Mexican Grill sits at a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and holds an Earnings ESP-3.69%, which should turn heads for the wrong reasons as we approach its report date.Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report)) – Wednesday, July 26 – After Market CloseSocial networking behemoth Facebook is scheduled to release its quarterly earnings report on July 26. Our Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for revenue of $9.17 billion and earnings of $1.13 per share, which constitutes strong year-over-year growth of 42.53% and 48.68%, respectively.Facebook has continued to expand and build its social media repertoire, and the company is also expanding into AI and big data research. These additions to the Facebook business model underscore the company’s strong leadership position. Facebook holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and possesses an Earnings ESP of -0.89%. Nevertheless, Facebook has defeated its earnings projections in each of its past seven operational quarters, including a beat of 18.18% last quarter.Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report)) – Thursday, July 27 – After Market CloseAmazon will report its latest earnings results on July 27. Our Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for revenue of $37.21 billion, which would constitute year-over-year growth of 22.40%. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate projects earnings of $1.38 per share, which would represent a year-over-year slump of 22.63%.Amazon has continued to increase its focus on a platform approach, and on top of its e-commerce dominance, the company is rapidly expanding its media and cloud services operations. Amazon sports a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an impressive Earnings ESP of 13.77%. Additionally, the firm beat its earnings projections last quarter by a whopping 43.69%, which should provide investors with a sense of optimism. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

3205,CMG,"Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG  -  Free Report) are slipping again on Friday, adding to the losses that the stock has suffered during this brutal week, which was marred by a pair of new food safety concerns.Chipotle fell more than 2% in morning trading today, touching a new 52-week low of $345.75 per share in the process. The stock has now lost nearly 12% of its value over the past five trading sessions.The downtrend continues as investors remain concerned about the company’s latest food safety issues. Earlier this week, Chipotle was forced to briefly close a Washington D.C.-area restaurant after multiple people reported food poisoning symptoms. Only one confirmed case of norovirus was linked back to the Chipotle store in question, but the alleged outbreak put food safety concerns back in the spotlight.This story got even worse on Thursday, when reports that rodents had gotten loose in a Dallas-area Chipotle started to surface on the internet. Several mice were captured by a customer’s cellphone camera running around on the floor and climbing on the wall of the restaurant. While a Chipotle spokesperson stressed that the incident was “extremely isolated,” it was certainly not the type of viral moment that investors wanted to see this week.We’re also just a few days away from Chipotle’s earnings report date. According to our Zacks Consensus Estimates, the company is expected to post earnings of $2.17 per share and revenues of $1.19 billion. These figures would represent year-over-year growth of 150% and 19%, respectively, but these comparisons don’t really paint the whole picture. In the prior-year quarter, Chipotle was still dealing with the fallout of its massive food safety scandal, and earnings and same-store sales plummeted.Nevertheless, an improved earnings report could be the catalyst for some positive momentum right now. However, the sentiment surrounding this report has not been strong recently. Over the past 60 days, we have witnessed a staggering 12 negative estimate revisions for Chipotle’s upcoming earnings, and these revisions have dragged our consensus estimate 23 cents lower in that time.Even more recently, we’ve watched Chipotle’s Most Accurate Estimate—a method of tracking the most current estimates—slip to $2.09 per share. This has given the stock a negative Earnings ESP of 3.69%, and paired with its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), this is not a good sign headed into its report.What’s worse, we’ve seen several negative estimate revisions for the company’s next-quarter and next-year earnings as well.Analysts are clearly not optimistic about Chipotle right now, and this sentiment was established prior to the latest string of bad news for the company.Any positive news that emerges from Chipotle’s earnings report could send to stock higher next week, as investors never like to keep a stock near its 52-week low for too long. However, even if Chipotle was able to post an earnings beat, it would be surpassing expectations that have already been significantly lowered over time. This is simply not the type of strong earnings activity we like to see here at Zacks.Chipotle has hit a big dip, and buying on the dip can give investors a unique chance at some quick profits. But be warned, because there could be more headaches ahead for Chipotle.For more coverage on Chipotle, as well as several of this week’s other major stories, check out the latest episode of the Zacks Friday Finish Line podcast:Want more stock market analysis from this author?

3207,CMG,"Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG  -  Free Report) are falling again on Thursday—just days after a restaurant briefly closed following an alleged norovirus outbreak—due to new reports that a storefront in the Dallas area was infested by rodents.Several rodents were apparently spotted by customers within the restaurant on Tuesday. One diner told a local NBC affiliate that her lunch was “ruined by rodents falling from the ceiling.”First-hand cellphone videos, which were obtained by CNBC, clearly show rodents crawling around the floor and on a wall in the store.“We learned yesterday that mice got into a restaurant, and we immediately contacted professionals who identified a small structural gap in the building as the likely access point,” a Chipotle spokesperson said.  “We’re having it repaired. Additionally, we reached out to the customer to make things right. This is an extremely isolated and rare incident and certainly not anything we’d ever want out customers to encounter.”The news comes in the wake of Chipotle’s latest food safety scare, which sent the stock tumbling nearly 5.5% on Tuesday. One confirmed case of norovirus and more than 130 reports of diners being sickened at a Washington D.C.-area restaurant were enough for Chipotle to briefly close the store for a deep-clean.On the same day, Maxim Group analyst Stephen Anderson upgraded Chipotle’s stock to a “Buy” from a “Hold,” and raised its price target price from $440 to $470.“We acknowledge shares are going to be more sensitive than those of peers to health-related restaurant closures, but the norovirus outbreak does not appear to be serious… nor is there any evidence that the illness has spread beyond that one location,” Anderson said.Nevertheless, Chipotle remains a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Want more stock market analysis from this author?

3208,CMG,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 25, after market close.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 25%. However, the trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise is a negative 8.59%.Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Likely to Affect Q2 ResultsChipotle’s new brand-management efforts, along with various sales-building initiatives like menu innovation, simplification of restaurant operations and increased brand marketing should aid in improving guest experience and reinstate customer affinity for the Chipotle brand. This, in turn, might drive its top- and bottom–line performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, Chipotle claims to be the only national restaurant brand to use no added colors, flavors or preservatives of any kind in its ingredients. The company’s enhanced focus on making better food accessible to everyone is thus expected to aid in bringing back health-conscious customers and improving sales in the quarter.Meanwhile, the rollout of “Smarter Pickup Times” technology in all its restaurants that offer digital ordering is anticipated to further drive sales as it improves the digital ordering experience.However, costs associated with marketing and promotional initiatives to connect with its customers, implementation of food safety measures and higher labor expenses are likely to continue thwarting the quarter’s profitability.In fact, during the first-quarter conference call, management declared that they expect a short supply environment for avocados that will add 40 basis points (bps) to the company’s food costs in the to-be-reported quarter. Furthermore, marketing and promotional activities are expected to total about 3.6% to 3.7% of sales in the quarter, due to the brand’s national TV campaign.Additionally, a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space is expected to limit revenue growth.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Chipotle this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Chipotle has an Earnings ESP of -2.74%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is $2.13, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $2.19. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Chipotle has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).As it is we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may want to consider from the Zacks categorized Retail–Restaurants industry, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.23% and a Zacks Rank #2.

"
3210,CMG,"Shares of Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report) plummeted 6.82% through early afternoon trading on Tuesday amid news that a Washington, D.C. area location closed this morning after some customers reported norovirus-like symptoms.Business Insider first reported that the fast-casual Mexican grill closed a Sterling, Virginia location after customers reported symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, and nausea. The roughly dozen affected Chipotle customers posted their symptoms on iwaspoisoned.com after eating at the restaurant on Friday or Saturday.Chipotle officials said they were already aware of the small number of illnesses. The company said it is currently working with health authorities to resolve the situation and even plans to reopen the location today after “thorough sanitization.”""We are working with health authorities to understand what the cause may be and to resolve the situation as quickly as possible,"" Chipotle executive director of food safety Jim Marsden said in a statement.""The reported symptoms are consistent with norovirus. Norovirus does not come from our food supply, and it is safe to eat at Chipotle.""The customers who reportedly contracted the norovirus can now count themselves among roughly 20 million Americans who are sickened by this illness every year. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, norovirus is the leading cause of food-related illness in U.S. – most often caused by contaminated employees who touched food without taking the proper safety precautions.Can’t Catch A BreakThe Denver-based company has fought for the last two years to regain its pre-E.coli outbreak power. Chipotle’s same store sales bounced back a bit in its first quarter after the company spent millions of dollars in marketing and customer giveaways. Last week, the company announced it would begin to test queso dip, new margaritas, and news salads.Just this morning, Maxim Group analyst Stephen Anderson upgraded Chipotle’s stock to a “Buy” from a “Hold,” and raised its price target price from $440 to $470. The upgrade helped shares of Chipotle gain about 1.1% early Tuesday morning.What might come as good news for Chipotle investors is that Anderson didn’t back down from his upgrade after today’s norovirus scare.“We acknowledge [Chipotle] shares are going to be more sensitive than those of peers to health-related restaurant closures, but the norovirus outbreak does not appear to be serious (14 afflicted), nor is there any evidence that the illness has spread beyond that one location,” he said.However, Chipotle was already a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) before today’s new setback, which could cause another massive customer retreat.

3211,CMG,"Domino's Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2018 earnings on Jul 19, 2018, before the market opens. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13%.Q2 ExpectationsThe question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Domino's will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.76, higher than $1.32 reported in the year-ago quarter. Of late, the company’s earnings estimates have witnessed upward revisions. In first-quarter 2018, it witnessed earnings growth of 58.7% on a year-over-year basis.Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of nearly $783.6 million, up 24.7% from the prior-year quarter.Let’s delve deeper to find out how the company’s top and bottom line will shape up this earnings season.Factors at PlayDomino's top line in the second-quarter 2018 will continue to be driven by solid brand positioning. Also, the company’s efforts to fortify its presence in the high-growth international markets bode well. Meanwhile, Domino's international growth continues to be strong and diversified across markets, courtesy of exceptional unit level economics. Notably, the first quarter of 2018 marked the 97th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales in its international business. Additionally, the company’s all four geographic regions reported positive comps, with Americas and Asia-Pacific gaining the most.Moving ahead, Domino's initiatives on the digital front, increased store counts, focus on re-imaging and other sales-boosting strategies are expected to help sustain the momentum. Furthermore, its digital loyalty program — Piece of the Pie Rewards — continues to contribute significantly toward increase in traffic. The company’s extended ways to order a pizza has kept it in the forefront of digital ordering and customer convenience.Domino’s also has a wide franchise network, both domestically and internationally. Impressively, by reducing its ownership of restaurants and focusing more on re-franchising, the company minimizes capital requirements and facilitates earnings per share growth and ROE expansion.Domino's Pizza Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Domino's Pizza Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Domino's Pizza Inc QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not show that Domino’s is likely to beat earnings estimates in second-quarter 2018.

3212,CMG,"It was only a couple of years ago that fast casual dining was the biggest trend in the restaurant industry. The dramatic shift to fast casual restaurants was mainly pushed by an increased interest, especially from millennials, in healthier food options that don’t break the bank.This style of dining, which is a mix between traditional fast food restaurants and fine dining, saw its sales grow at a high rate of 10 to 11 percent annually from 2011 to 2016, according to research provider Euromonitor International. Riding off the highs of being at the center of the restaurant industry, a great amount of fast casual restaurants went public or saw share prices soar between 2013 and 2015, including Shake Shack (SHAK  -  Free Report), Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report), Habit Restaurants (HABT  -  Free Report), Potbelly (PBPB  -  Free Report), Noodles & Company (NDLS  -  Free Report), Zoe’s Kitchen , El Pollo Loco (LOCO  -  Free Report), and Panera Bread.At the forefront of this trend was Mexican chain Chipotle, the perfect answer to the younger generation’s desire for higher-quality ingredients with the same convenience of fast food. At its peak the company’s stock was at $758.61 per share on Aug 5, 2015 and looked to be destined to take over the entire restaurant industry—until disaster struck.An E.coli outbreak in 2015 caused shares of the company to drastically fall and struggle to recover, with the stock closing 2017 at just $289.03.Recent performance hasn’t looked that good for other fast casual restaurants either, as other main leaders, such as Noodles & Company, have struggled as well.  The restaurant which specializes in pastas, salads, and soups priced its IPO at $18 per share and ended that day at $36.75. Now, the company trades at only around $11, a 70% drop from its first day’s closing price. In 2017, the company reported a net loss of $37.5 million.Drivers of the DownfallAlthough food-borne illnesses were a major reason for Chipotle’s fall, there were other underlying factors that led to the steady demise of the company and the fast casual industry as a whole. Primarily, the fast food industry, once proclaimed dead by experts, has been able to fight back and again begin to take over the restaurant industry.Typical fast food giants like McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) have been able to respond to by providing new premium  and higher quality menu options, while still serving meals at a slightly lower cost than fast casual restaurants typically do.The move by fast food restaurants to cater to new dining trends has made fast casual establishments lose much of their cultural significance, which is what drove most of their success initially. Fast food giants have also further countered and improved their relevance with younger generations through social media marketing.An example is another classic fast food staple, Wendy’s (WEN  -  Free Report), and the company’s frequent and popular use of Twitter responses to generate publicity.How Fast Casual Can ReboundThe restaurants that were once all the hype can’t afford to simply depend on better ingredients anymore. New strategies need to be implemented that differentiate this style of dining from their fast food counterparts. The leader of the fast casual revolution, Chipotle, has already made steps towards that goal.Newly appointed CEO Brian Niccol, who was previously the CEO of rival Taco Bell, recently stated goals of becoming not just a food brand but a “purpose-driven lifestyle brand”. In addition, Niccol aims to slowly start rolling in new menu options, increased mobile ordering, and a stronger social media presence.The new CEO understands that the company can’t be stagnant in a market that is full of innovation.  All of the changes are meant to bring Chipotle back to center of attention for consumers, just as it was about three years ago.Bottom LineAs the battle for the restaurant industry continues, investors should continue to wait to see what moves the leaders in the fast casual trend decide to make. This helps explain some of why Chipotle and Noodles & Company are both currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).There is clearly potential, as the Chipotle stock has risen more than 40% since Niccol took over on March 5. Its Q2 earnings report, which will be released on July 26, will be a vital indicator as to where the stock will go in the future and if Niccol’s strategic initiatives are truly paying off. Based on our Zacks Consensus Estimates, the company’s Q2 earnings are expected to move to $2.78 per share, a 19.8% surge from the year-ago period.Make sure to check back here for more on Chipotle’s earnings outlook and the rest of the fast casual industry! More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

3213,CMG,"Noodles & Company (NDLS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2018 numbers on Jul 18, after market close.After struggling with soft consumer demand, along with declining comps in 2017 and the first quarter of 2018, the company is expected to make a comeback in the second quarter. The company’s various initiatives to sustain top-line momentum and restrict costs are expected to have paid off in the second quarter.Notably, shares of Noodles & Company have rallied a whopping 186.7% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s collective growth of 1.5%.Let’s take a look at how the company’s second quarter will shape up.Top Line to Improve on Sales-Building EffortsNoddle’s & Company’s major sales-building initiatives like streamlining of menu and innovation, introduction of new cooking procedures, effective marketing strategy, increased focus on the off-premise business and investments in technology-driven initiatives like digital ordering are expected to have positively contributed to the top line in the second quarter. Despite the 5.3% decline in revenues in the first quarter, we expect its revenues to grow in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s revenues is pegged at $114.8 million, suggesting 1.8% growth from the year-ago quarter.Meanwhile, in the first quarter, comps were affected by a shift in the timing of the Easter holiday. System-wide comps in the first quarter declined 0.2% and that of the company-owned restaurants fell 0.3%. Defying the trend of sluggish comps, the consensus estimate projects both system wide and company-owned comps to grow 2.3% in the second quarter.Cost Cuts to Boost EarningsWhile high costs from restaurant operation and increased labor expenses might have been a potential threat to Noodles & Company’s earnings, the company has been undertaking the task of closing underperforming restaurants, which will in turn improve margins. In fact, the company successfully cut down operating expenses by drastically lowering pre-opening costs.Total costs and expenses in the first quarter declined 99.2% year over year, owing to a sharp decline in pre-opening costs. Cost of sales and labor also declined 8.8% and 7.6%, respectively, from the year-ago quarter. Restaurant contribution margin was 12.9% in the first quarter of 2018 compared with 11% in the first quarter of 2017, reflecting an increase of 190 basis points. We expect the upside trend in margins to continue in the second quarter as well. Subsequently, the consensus estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at 3 cents, reflecting a 200% increase from the prior-year quarter.Our Quantitative Model Does Not Predict a BeatNoodles & Company does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

3214,CMG,"Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report) are riding high on improvement in comps and restaurant openings, various sales-building and strategic initiatives as well as steps to enhance safety and customer experience. These efforts have aided the company’s shares to surge by 39.6% in the past six months, against the industry’s decline of 5.3%. However, higher costs might hurt the company’s performance in the coming quarters. Let’s delve deeper.Hidden CatalystsChipotle, being one of the most recognized fast casual Mexican restaurant chains in the United States, bore the brunt of negative publicity throughout 2016 due to an issue of food-borne illnesses that surfaced toward 2015-end. As a safety measure, the company was forced to close several of its outlets. Ever since then, this fast-casual Mexican chain has been undertaking aggressive efforts to restore its economic model as well as regain customer trust. As part of its revival strategy, Chipotle fulfilled its pledge of using no added colors, flavors or preservatives of any kind in any of its ingredients. In fact, the company now makes use of only 51 real ingredients to prepare all of its food, in stark contrast to most other fast food chains.The company is also working on strengthening its brand and recovering sales by shifting its focus from giveaways, discounts and rewards to new menu items, operational excellence and enhancement of guest experience by retraining workers, technology-driven convenience along with more aggressive brand marketing.The company plans to pilot various tests across key innovation-focused areas such as consumer access, digital, menu and restaurant experiences, and realignment of the organization to witness incremental growth. Meanwhile, roll out of queso has substantially spurred sales of the company. The queso added 200 basis points (bps) to the average check in the first quarter of 2018. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is prioritizing e-commerce program to gain customer confidence as a part of its digital innovation. The company is aggressively trying to make digital ordering more appealing to customers and efficient for its restaurants, in order to drive digital sales and regain customers. In this regard, Chipotle has redesigned and simplified its online ordering site, enabled online payment for catering, online meal customizations and collaborated with several well-known third-party providers for delivery.ConcernsChipotle’s continued efforts to connect with its customers in order to regain their trust and loyalty as well as bring them back to its stores on the back of high marketing and promo expenses have been hurting its profitability. Moreover, costs to support the company’s newly designed food safety program is likely to weigh on the company’s margins. Further, the implementation of food safety practices has increased the amount of labor required to prepare and serve food, resulting in higher labor costs that is likely to keep profits under pressure.Competition among fast-casual, quick-service and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry is expected to remain fierce with respect to price, food quality, service, location and concept, which may adversely impact Chipotle’s operating margins and profits. Particularly, the company is facing price competition from low cost “value meal” menu offerings of fast-casual and quick-service segments of the industry.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks from the restaurant space include Wingstop (WING  -  Free Report), Dine Brands (DIN  -  Free Report) and Domino’s (DPZ  -  Free Report).

3216,CMG,"Since Brian Niccol became the CEO of Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report) in March, Chipotle’s stock price has only gone up. According to CNBC, Chipotle’s stock move has been based solely on Niccol’s reputation. Prior to Chipotle, Niccol was the CEO at Taco Bell, owned by Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report), where he changed the image of the restaurant for better.From introducing mobile order and pay to opening restaurants around the globe, Niccol transformed Taco Bell into a lifestyle brand. Similarly, Niccol plans to do the same at Chipotle with his prior success to make it more of a youthful and culturally relevant brand.Niccol’s Past Success In the past three years, Chipotle was not doing so well. The stock fell to its lowest level following food safety concerns, and this was a day before Niccol was to be named CEO. The stock price was at $251.33 per share. As of today, Chipotle’s stock is sitting at $459.35 per share.In a press release by Yum! Brands, the CEO, Greg Creed, thanked Niccol on his success of always keeping Taco Bell culturally relevant, innovative and accessible for customers. Along with changing the restaurants slogan and introducing creative new food items, Taco Bell’s sales were up 5% last year, growing nearly $500 million according to CNBC. With Niccol’s optimistic qualities, he is known for encouraging employees to pitch any ideas they might have in return for creating an inclusive workplace. And, his past experience in consumer-focused businesses and relevant skill sets in areas like marketing and operations, Niccol can help address any of Chipotle’s primary issues, like from the food safety incidents, says David Tarantino, an analyst at Baird.What Does the Future of Chipotle Look Like? Currently, CMG is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM score of ‘B’. After its Q1 report with Niccol as CEO, Chipotle’s earnings surged over 33% year-over-year to $2.13 per share. Total revenue climbed as well by 7.4% to $1.15 billion. With a new CEO who is experienced and dedicated as ever, consumers and investors alike can finally start to see Chipotle on a steady profitable trail. Recently, they also announced the addition of a few new menu items at their test kitchen in NYC, which could be a potential asset to the future success of the company as well.With Niccol’s vision of rebranding Chipotle to be more young and fun, it could potentially become a go to spot, more than it already is for many food consumers.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.

A number of customers have also reported similar symptoms after eating at the same restaurant on IWasPoisoned.com, which is a platform to anonymously report suspected foodborne illnesses.Food Safety Issues ContinueThroughout 2016 Chipotle’s results continued to be affected by the negative publicity related to food-borne illnesses, which surfaced toward 2015-end.

Construction spending increased 0.3% to $1.22 trillion in September, up from 0.1% in August.

The tax bill reduces the corporate tax rate to 20%, making it the permanent rate.On Nov 9, another version of the tax plan was released by the Senate Finance Committee. The Senate version differed from that of the House panel's in several ways. For instance, unlike the House Republicans’ tax proposals which focus on reducing corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, the Senate version supports a similar tax cut only by 2019. Such a confused state of affairs dampened investor sentiment. Moreover, market watchers speculated that no formal decision was likely on the tax Bill before Thanksgiving. Such fears weighed heavily on the broader markets.House of Representatives Passes CutsOn Nov 16, House of Representatives finally passed the much-awaited tax cuts legislation. This takes President Trump and his team one step closer toward realizing their most important agenda — tax reforms.Ultimately, in a 12-11 vote on Nov 28, the Senate Budget Committee advanced the Tax Bill proposed by the members of the GOP.

(CMG  -  Free Report) lost 1.8% and toy makers like Hasbro (HAS  -  Free Report) and Mattel MAT declined 1% and 1.5%, respectively. Fed Refrains from Rate Hike, Powell to Be Next Fed ChairMarkets gained traction on Wednesday after the Fed decided not to raise the benchmark interest rates and offered a positive view about the U.S. economy. At the end of its two day meet, the Fed stated that the U.S. economy has been growing at a ""solid rate"" compared to a ""moderate rate"" in September.Although, the Fed kept the interest rate unchanged in the range of 1% to 1.25%, it indicated that there is a huge possibility of a hike in rate in December.  Meanwhile, a minority of policymakers maintained that the rate hike should be kept on hold till the inflation target of 2% is met.Meanwhile, President Trump appointed member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors Jerome Powell as Janet Yellen’s successor post the expiration of her term as Fed Chief in February.In the minutes of Oct 31-Nov 1 FOMC policy meeting, Fed officials clearly hinted at a December rate hike.

The blue-chip index suffered such losses after shares of aerospace giant, Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), tanked 2.9% following a decline in revenues of two of its business units, as compared to the last year. The company stated that it had incurred $329 million in costs due to problems associated with production of its KC-46 aerial refueling tanker. This marked the Dow’s biggest single-day dip since Sep 5, 2017 when the blue-chip index swooned 1.1% in a single day.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 lost almost 12 points to end in negative territory.

(Read More)Trump Keeps Investors on TenterhooksAmidst much speculation regarding who will go on to head the Fed, investors eagerly wait for President Trump’s decision to choose Janet Yellen’s successor, post the expiration of her term as the Fed Chief in February, 2018. In a surprising move, Trump sought help of the Senate Republicans on Tuesday to zero in on a potential candidate for the post of Fed Chief. In a show-of-hands, Senators from the GOP unanimously vouched for Stanford University Professor John Taylor to be the next Chief of Fed. Trump would reportedly announce the name of Yellen’s successor officially before he heads out on a trip to Asia. Some experts commented that ‘show-of-hands’ might possibly be a decisive factor affecting Trump’s decision.Meanwhile, broader markets gained from positive investor sentiment due to hopes that the existing tax code would soon be amended. The green signal to the budget blueprint ensures taxpayers that existing tax codes would be rewritten, more so because it has unlocked a procedure using which President Trump and his team can push through their tax reforms using only Republican votes.Economic DataOn the economic data front, new home sales surged to 667,000 in September, up from 561,000 in August — an increase of 18.9% from the previous figure.

3221,CMG,"Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report) declined nearly 10% in afterhours trading on Oct 24, after the company reported lower-than-expected third-quarter 2017 results. Further, an expected slowdown in new restaurant openings led to the slump in the stock price.Earnings and Revenue DiscussionChipotle reported earnings of 69 cents per share, up significantly from the prior-year quarter earnings of 27 cents per share. Notably, the bottom line included effects from a data breach in April 2017 on its restaurant's payment system.Precisely, management cited a 64 cent per share impact associated to the data security incident and a 13 cent impact from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma on the quarter’s earnings.Excluding the effects of the data breach, adjusted earnings came in at $1.33 per share, far below the Zacks Consensus Estimate $1.56 per share.Total revenue rose 8.8% from the year-ago quarter to $1.128 billion primarily driven by new restaurant openings and somewhat by increase in comps.  Meanwhile, revenues were almost in line with the consensus mark of $1.134 billion.Behind the Headline NumbersComps grew a mere 1% in the quarter despite the highly-anticipated nationwide roll-out of queso cheese dip. This uptick was significantly lower than the prior-quarter growth of 8.1%.Meanwhile, food costs, as a percentage of revenues, decreased 10 bps to 35% given reduction in paper cost and usage as well as benefit of menu price increases in select restaurants during second-quarter of 2017. These were somewhat offset by higher avocado and beef prices as well as steak making up a higher portion of its product mix compared to the year-ago quarter.General and administrative expenses comprised 8.8% of the total revenue, reflecting an increase of 120 bps year over year.Restaurant level operating margin was 16.1%, up 200 bps from 14.1% recorded in the year-ago quarter. The upside was primarily driven by reduced marketing and promotion expense and labor efficiencies.Guidance for 2017Chipotle now projects comps to increase nearly 6.5% in 2017 compared with prior expectation of an increase in high-single digits. Additionally, new restaurant openings are anticipated to be slightly below the low end of the previously guided range of 195–210.2018 ViewManagement intends to open 130 to 150 new restaurants in 2018. By slowing down the new openings, the company aims to better focus on already opened restaurants.Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. QuoteOur TakeWe note that, 2017 has been a challenging year for Chipotle. Though initially sales somewhat recovered from the massive food safety scandal, which surfaced toward 2015-end, a fresh round of food-safety scare this summer once again raised alarming questions. Also, a menu price increase of roughly 5% in about 900 of its restaurants in mid or late November might not go down well with customers.Meanwhile, following a board shake up and various management changes, Chipotle is now working hard to strengthen its brand, recover sales and bring back customers. The company plans to do this by shifting its strategy from giveaways, discounts and rewards to new menu items, simplification and improvement of restaurant operations, technology-driven convenience as well as enhancement of guest experience by retraining workers.Whether these endeavors will bear fruit? Only time will tell!Zacks Rank & Upcoming ReleasesChipotle has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Among other firms in the restaurant space, BJ's Restaurants, Inc.

3227,CMG,"We’ve already got a busy day of Q3 earnings reports to sift through, and market participants should take heart that, by and large, most major companies reporting before the opening bell have outperformed expectations — in some cases by a wide margin. After today’s market close, we expect another wave of Q3 reports from companies such as AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report). But let’s dig in with the breakfast portion of earnings results:Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) is up 7% in pre-market trading following its blowout results in Q3 earnings and revenues. Its bottom line of $1.77 per share amounts to a 45% positive earnings surprise over the $1.22 in the Zacks consensus, and miles ahead of the 85 cents per share in CAT’s fiscal Q3 2016. Sales reached $11.4 billion, far surpassing the $10.6 billion expected and $9.2 billion a year ago. Construction growth in China and on-shore oil & gas businesses in North America drove quarterly growth most notably.Remarkably, CAT’s 45% earnings surprise is roughly in-line with the heavy machinery manufacturer’s trailing four quarters of earnings beats, bolstered by a Q1 2017 surprise of more than 100%. Caterpillar has also upped full-year guidance to around $6.25 per share; $5.26 was the previous Zacks consensus estimate. CAT also carries a Zacks Style Score of A.General Motors (GM  -  Free Report) also outperformed expectations this morning: its $1.32 per share easily outperformed the $1.07 expected — though results are still down more than 20% year over year — on quarterly sales of $33.62 billion — well beyond the $31.6 billion we had been looking for. GM looks to bring two electric cars to market in the next year and a half. It also has posted a positive earnings surprise for at least the past five straight quarters, with a trailing 4-quarter average of 14.7%. Shares of GM are up 3% at this point in today’s pre-market.Defense and aerospace major United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report) topped expectations on earnings, revenues and guidance. This is the third straight earnings beat for the parent company of Pratt & Whitney, Otis Elevators, and many other companies: $1.73 per share beat the Zacks consensus by 5 cents, whereas the top-line actual of $15.1 billion outperformed the $14.9 billion we had been looking for. Full-year guidance was also raised from $6.45 - 6.60 per share to $6.58 - 6.63.Industrial supply giant 3M (MMM  -  Free Report) also beat top and bottom-line estimates prior to Tuesday’s open, with earnings of $2.33 per share and revenues of $8.17 billion surprising the $2.21 per share and $7.91 billion expected. Full-year guidance was also ratcheted up notably, from the previous Zacks consensus estimate of $8.95 per share to $9.00 - 9.15 as of its Q3 report. Shares of 3M are up 1.6% thus far in today’s pre-market.McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) posted a mixed Q3 earnings report this morning, beating earnings estimates by a penny to $1.76 per share on $5.76 billion, which was a bit shy of the $5.80 billion expected. The Zacks ESP called this one-cent beat exactly, even as the negative impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma hit same-store sales in Texas and Florida from Q3 2016. In fact, U.S. comps were up 4.1% in the quarter, and International was up 6%. Shares are currently up 1.3% in early trading.Other companies this morning to have surpassed expectations and also raised full-year guidance are Stanley Black & Decker (SWK  -  Free Report), Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and Polaris (PII  -  Free Report).

3229,CMG,"The Q3 reporting cycle has started on an encouraging note with multiple companies reporting significant earnings and revenue growth compared with the prior quarters. Particularly, the momentum on the revenue side is quite palpable.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for the 87 S&P 500 members that have reported results (as of Oct 20) are up 9.4% from the year-ago period, courtesy a 7.3% rise in revenues. Notably, 71.3% of the companies that have posted their quarterly numbers have surpassed earnings estimates, while 70.1% have exceeded top-line expectations.Restaurant Stocks in FocusThe restaurant industry belongs to the broader Retail-Wholesale sector and the space is expected to deliver mixed performance this earnings season. Overall Q3 earnings for the sector are expected to be down 2.2% year over year, though revenues are anticipated to rise 5.8%.In the recent quarters, the restaurant industry’s sales trends have been very challenging, given soft consumer spending on dining out, which has resulted in low consumption. Declining comps due to sluggish traffic trends along with rising costs are thus taking the sheen out of restaurant companies. Nevertheless, restaurant operators are undertaking various sales building and digital initiatives to enhance guest experience and, in turn, drive traffic and comps.Also, the third quarter of 2017 marked the seventh consecutive quarter of negative comparable sales (comps) for the restaurant industry as a whole, per TDn2K’s Black Box Intelligence. Markedly, the quarter posted the second worst sales and traffic growth rates in over five years. In fact, the recent hurricanes appear to have particularly impacted results for restaurant companies in the quarter.Thus, though the overall scenario is still bordering on the negative and the earnings picture seems to be less enticing, innovative operators with strong fundamentals are likely to continue exhibiting strength even in a not-so-favorable environment. Let’s take a look at what might be in store for the two restaurant companies that are set to report their third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24. Will these companies manage to put up a decent performance?Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report) came up with a positive earnings surprise of 7.41% in the last quarter. However, the trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise is a negative 3.94%.Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. QuoteOur proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Chipotle this quarter. This is because, according to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of the two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better – to increase its odds of an earnings surprise.For the quarter, the company has an Earnings ESP of -6.08% and a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.As it is we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Notably, the company’s earnings and revenues are likely to improve year over year. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings stands at $1.60, representing a year-over-year increase of over 100%. Also, revenues are estimated to improve 10.2% to $1.14 billion.However, it is to be noted that the to-be-reported quarter is expected to witness easy year-over-year comparisons as Chipotle was in the midst of its massive food-safety scandal this time last year.Though Chipotle’s new brand-management efforts, continual restaurant openings along with various sales-building initiatives bodes well, renewed food safety concerns may pressurize the company’s top line. Also, costs associated with marketing programs, higher labor expenses along with elevated food costs, given rise in avocado prices, are likely to dent the quarter’s profitability (read more: Will Food Safety Issues Hurt Chipotle's Q3 Earnings?).McDonald's Corp. (MCD  -  Free Report) pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 6.79%. In fact, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last 12 quarters, with the trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise coming in at 7.44%.McDonald's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  McDonald's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | McDonald's Corporation QuoteWe expect the company to surpass expectations in the quarter due to the combination of its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and Earnings ESP of +0.18%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the U.S. segment is currently pegged at nearly $2 billion, reflecting a decline of nearly 4% year over year, given the prevailing challenging restaurant environment in the domestic space. Nevertheless, various sales and digital initiatives undertaken are likely to drive the segment’s comps.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $1.82 billion and $1.48 billion for International Lead Markets and High-Growth Markets, reflecting a year-over-year decline of over 3% and 10%, respectively. Political and economic unrest in key operating regions are likely to hurt sales, despite consistent efforts to improve performance and drive comps in these markets.Meanwhile, though increased focus on refranchising is likely to boost earnings, it may hamper the quarter’s revenue growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings is pegged at $1.75, representing a year-over-year increase of 8.1%. The same for revenues is projected to be $5.8 billion, down 10.2% from the prior-year quarter (read more: Will Comps Growth Drive McDonald's Q3 Earnings?).Stay tuned!

3230,CMG,"As we wrap up our first busy week of Q3 earnings season, investors have to be feeling pretty good about the results so far. Less-than-impressive banking results were overshadowed by solid earnings growth throughout the S&P 500, with plenty of estimate beats to go around.Total earnings for the 52 S&P 500 members that have reported already are up 13.3%, while revenues gained 6.9%. About 77% of these companies have surpassed EPS estimates, and 73% beat revenue estimates.Next week will mark our busiest period for marquee reports, with 180 S&P 500 companies scheduled to announce their latest results. Earnings growth is expected to continue, which should make investors excited.For more on what investors should expect from Q3 earnings, check out our exclusive Earnings Trends report. This full report includes a variety of key historical results, as well as estimates for the current and upcoming periods.And as earnings season continues to heat up, investors should also remember that they can always use the Zacks Earnings Calendar to plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases. This handy tool is your perfect one-stop-shop to properly prepare for the market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio.Today, we’ve made that task even easier for you. Using the Earnings Calendar, we looked ahead to next week and selected the biggest reports to watch. Make sure to keep an eye on these companies as they prepare to report during the week of October 23.1.       Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG  -  Free Report)Struggling fast-casual restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill is slated to release its third-quarter earnings results after the closing bell on October 24. The company has met or surpassed estimates in three-straight quarters, but profits have yet to return to their pre-food safety scandal levels, and Chipotle’s momentum has all but vanished.According to our latest consensus estimates, Chipotle is expected to post earnings of $1.60 per share and revenues of $1.14 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth of 102% and 10%, respectively. However, these growth rates are lifted by Chipotle’s weak fiscal 2016. Headed into the report, estimates have been slipping, and the stock is currently a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). 2.       The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report)Aerospace giant Boeing is scheduled to announce its latest quarterly results before the market opens on October 25. Boeing has met or surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in five consecutive quarters, and with shares up more than 66% year-to-date, investors know that BA has been one of the industry’s hottest stocks.Based on our latest consensus estimates, we expect to see Boeing report earnings of $2.66 per share and revenues of $24.06 billion. This would mark a year-over-slump of 24% in profits, while this sales figures would represent a marginal gain of 0.7%. Still, the company is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now, and its diversified defense business should continue to pad results. 3.       Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report)E-commerce behemoth Amazon is slated to release its third-quarter earnings report after the market closes on October 26. After starting the year on fire, shares have hit a lull since the company’s massive earnings miss last quarter, but investors can rest assured that this report will dominate headlines for days.According to our latest consensus estimates, Amazon is expected to report a loss of 2 cents per share and revenues of $41.97 billion. This would represent sales growth of 28% but an EPS slump of nearly 104%. Some investors may be concerned about Amazon’s short-term spending, but Wall Street will likely react to the company’s growth in key divisions like Amazon Web Services. Want more stock market analysis from this author?

3232,CMG,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24, after market close.The company’s earnings and revenues are likely to improve year over year. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings stands at $1.69, representing an year-over-year increase of over 100%. Also, revenues are estimated to increase 10.3% to $1.14 billion.However, it is to be noted that the to-be-reported quarter is expected to witness easy year-over-year comparisons as Chipotle was in the midst of its massive food-safety scandal this time last year.Throughout 2016 Chipotle’s results continued to be affected by the negative publicity related to the food-borne illnesses, which surfaced toward 2015-end. Also, the closure of a Washington-area outlet during the third quarter owing to an apparent norovirus alert has started a fresh round of food-safety scare. Evidence of rodents was found at a Dallas outlet, further adding to the woes.Meanwhile Chipotle continues to make efforts to strengthen its brand and recover sales by shifting strategies from giveaways, discounts and rewards to new menu items, simplification of restaurant operations, upgrade of guest experience, better operations including faster throughput and more aggressive brand marketing. This, in turn, might drive the company’s top- and bottom–line performance in the quarter under review.Nonetheless, renewed food safety concerns may pressurize the company’s top line, suggesting that the company has a long way to go before it can put all these troubles behind and return to its former glory.In fact, shares of Chipotle have lost 32% over the past six months, as against 6.3% growth recorded by the industry.That said, let’s wait and see whether the upcoming earnings release would exert more pressure on the stock. Though Chipotle delivered an earnings beat in three of the trailing four quarters, the average earnings surprise comes in at a negative 3.94%.Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. QuoteAlso, our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat in the third quarter.Notably, a stock needs to have the right combination of the two key criteria — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Unfortunately, this is not the case here, as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Chipotle has an Earnings ESP of -9.73%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Chipotle has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).As it is we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Factors Likely to Influence Q3 ResultsChipotle claims to be the only national restaurant brand to use no added colors, flavors or preservatives of any kind in its ingredients. The company’s enhanced focus on making better food accessible to everyone is thus expected to aid in bringing back health-conscious customers and improving sales in the third quarter.The addition of new restaurants is expected to bolster revenues. Furthermore, the rollout of Smarter Pickup Times technology in all its restaurants that offer digital ordering is anticipated to drive sales as it improves the digital ordering experience. Markedly, earnings are expected to get a boost from revenue growth and share repurchases.Yet, costs associated with marketing programs designed to drive traffic and build loyalty with its customers are likely to continue thwarting the quarter’s profitability. In fact, Chipotle expects marketing and promo costs to account for nearly 3.1% of sales in the second half of 2017. Higher labor expenses along with elevated food costs, given rise in avocado prices, are likely to further dent the quarter’s profitability.Meanwhile, a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space is expected to limit revenue growth. Also, the addition of Queso to its menu is not likely to add much to its top line as it was introduced only in mid-September.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a couple of stocks, which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Dave & Buster's Entertainment, Inc. (PLAY  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +9.86% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc.

3233,CMG,"(0:30) - Nifty Fifty: Secular Bulls Of The Past(5:45) - Lessons To Learn From The Nifty Fifty(9:00) - Tracey's Top Stock Picks: Fizzled Out Growth Stocks(16:10) - Episode Roundup: Podcast@Zacks.comWelcome to Episode #64 of the Value Investor PodcastEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio service, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.The growth stocks are still on a rampage, with FANG, the biotechs and the semiconductor stocks soaring in 2017.A lot of people in the media like to compare this market with the late 1990s dot-com era but Tracey thinks it more closely resembles the late 1960s and early 1970s bull market.And for value investors, that means having patience.The Rise of the Nifty FiftyIn the 1960s, growth stocks were also all the rage with investors jumping into a group of about 50 stocks that took on the popular name “The Nifty Fifty.”These were considered blue chip stocks where nothing could go wrong.  Investors were willing to buy them at whatever valuation in order to get their innovation and growth. Sound familiar?By the time of the 1972 bear market, the group was trading with an average valuation of 50x.But then, these growth stocks fizzled, and the stock market along with them.Today, investors are willing to pay a high price for many of the cutting-edge growth stocks. But some are already fizzling.Could the fizzling growth stocks be value stocks? Or are they value traps?5 Growth Stocks That Are Out of Favor1.     Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report)) shares have fallen 56% over the last 2 years. The PR issues it faced in late 2015 haven’t yet abated. The shares are no longer the darling of Wall Street. But is it a value at this level?2.    Ulta (ULTA  -  Free Report)) shares are down 20% year-to-date as the analysts are concerned it’s going to be Amazoned. It once traded as high as 35x earnings and is now at 23x. Is it a value?3.    Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report)) was once one of the top growth stocks. It was expected to take the mantle away from Nike as the top apparel sportswear and shoe maker. But shares are down 43% year-to-date. They once traded near $50 and are now around $16. Is it time to get in?4.    General Electric (GE  -  Free Report)) is trading at multi-year lows with shares down 27% in 2017. Wall Street has turned its back on this once “sure thing” blue chip. It trades with a forward P/E of just 15.3. Should value investors be interested?5.    Disney (DIS  -  Free Report)) had been flying high for years as its movies have dominated the box office, especially the Star Wars franchise. But shares are down 10% over the last 2 years, underperforming the overall stock market. They used to trade around 20x earnings but now trade at just 15.3 times. Is this a buying opportunity?While many of the Nifty Fifty companies are still around and trading on the exchanges, such as Walmart, Coke and IBM, quite a few are now defunct or a shadow of their former selves including Schlitz Brewing, Polaroid and Eastman Kodak.Additionally, after the bear market of the 1970s, it took years for some of the Nifty Fifty companies to again hit their pre-bear highs.That’s a reminder for investors that, in the end, valuation does matter.What else should you know about finding value in the fizzling growth stocks?Tune into this week’s podcast to find out.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

3234,CMG,"Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG  -  Free Report) popped more than 2% on Friday morning after it was revealed that the company was one of several restaurants partnering with Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) on the social media site’s new food ordering service.Facebook will now let its U.S. users order food for delivery or take-out directly through its mobile application and website. In a blog post detailing the new service, Facebook said that it has partnered with several chains, including Chipotle, Five Guys, Panera Bread, Jack in the Box (JACK  -  Free Report), Wingstop (WING  -  Free Report), and Papa John’s (PZZA  -  Free Report).Facebook also mentioned that it has teamed up with food ordering services Delivery.com, DoorDash, ChowNow, Zuppler, EatStreet, Slice, and Olo. Users will be able to order from any restaurants that already take orders via these platforms.“People already go to Facebook to figure out what to eat by reading about nearby restaurants, and seeing what their friends say about them. So, we’re making it even easier,” wrote Alex Himel, Facebook’s VP of Local.Facebook has integrated the new “Order Food” section into its “Explore” menu, and users will be able to easily view restaurants in their vicinity, as well as reviews and recommendations from friends.Facebook shares moved about 1% higher in morning trading Friday. Shares of food delivery platform GrubHub (GRUB  -  Free Report) opened more than 3% lower, but the stock has since recovered.Nevertheless, GrubHub investors might be worried about increasing competition in the food delivery space.

Further, the bottom line climbed 32.3% year over year on strong sales and a lower share count.Meanwhile, adoption of new accounting standards for share-based compensation have reduced tax expenses and added as much as 7 cents to Domino's earnings in the reported quarter.Quarterly revenues jumped 13.6% year over year to $643.6 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $630.8 million by over 2%. The improvement was on the back of higher supply chain revenues as well as increased same store sales, and store count growth at both domestic and international markets.CompsGlobal retail sales (including total sales of franchise and company-owned units) were up 14.5% year over year. The uptick was primarily owing to strong comps from international stores. Excluding foreign currency impact, global retail sales increased 14.2%.During the quarter, the company’s domestic stores (including company-owned and franchise stores) comps increased 8.4%. This compared unfavorably with 13% growth in the year-ago quarter and 9.5% growth in the previous quarter.The company experienced year-over-year comps growth of 8.4% at domestic company-owned stores, lower than 13.8% comps growth in the year-ago quarter and 11.2% growth in the last quarter. Also, domestic franchise stores comps grew 8.4%, lower than comps growth of 12.9% and 9.3%, in the year-ago quarter and the preceding quarter, respectively.Comps at international stores, excluding foreign currency translation, grew 5.1%. This was better than the prior quarter improvement of 2.6% but lower than the year-ago quarter rise of 6.6%.MarginsDomino’s operating margin increased 10 bps year over year to 30.8% in the quarter under review.Also, the net income margin rose 50 bps to 8.8%. The rise in the company’s net income was primarily driven by an increase in comps growth and store count as well as higher supply chain volumes. The adoption of the new equity-based compensation accounting standard too drove net income. However, the same was somewhat offset mainly due to higher general and administrative expenses from investments in technological initiatives.Domino's Pizza Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Domino's Pizza Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Domino's Pizza Inc QuoteZacks Rank & Upcoming ReleasesDomino’s carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

3236,CMG,"Shares of quick-casual and fresh Mexican food restaurant chains operator, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report), have declined 32.8% over the past six months compared with 8% growth of the industry it belongs to.Moreover, this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company has been witnessing downward estimate revisions of late, reflecting analysts’ pessimism on its growth prospects.Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Chipotle’s current-quarter earnings has slumped 8.7%, reflecting 12 downward revisions versus none upward. Also, its current-year earnings estimates have moved down 5%, due to nine downward revisions versus three upward revisions.This apart, Chipotle has a number of other aspects that make it an unattractive investment option at this point.Food-Safety IssuesThroughout 2016 Chipotle’s results continued to be affected by the negative publicity related to the food-borne illnesses, which surfaced toward 2015-end.Moreover, the recent closure of a Washington-area outlet due to an apparent norovirus alert has started a fresh round of food-safety scare. Evidence of rodents was also found at a Dallas outlet that further added to the woes.Industry HeadwindsThe U.S. restaurant space has not been too enticing for the last few quarters. Notably, same-store sales growth has been dull in a difficult sales environment. Traffic too has been weak. In fact, the second quarter of 2017 marked the sixth consecutive quarter of negative comp sales for the restaurant industry as a whole, thus continuing the somber mood. Chipotle is no exception to the trend, and resultantly the company’s sales have also come under pressure.Rising Costs Putting Pressure on MarginsChipotle intends to continue using a mix of marketing programs designed to drive traffic and build loyalty with its customers. In fact, the company expects marketing and promo costs to account for nearly 3.1% of sales in the second half of 2017.Also, implementation of food safety practices has increased the amount of labor required to prepare and serve food, resulting in higher labor costs that may continue to keep profits under pressure. Alongside, rising avocado prices pose a threat to the restaurant chain's profitability as well.In fact, Chipotle has recorded trailing 12-month net margin of just 3.2% compared with the industry average of 15.1%. Given the continual rise in expenses, the trend is not expected to reverse for the company any time soon.Valuation Looks IrrationalChipotle seems overvalued when compared with the broader industry. Its current price-earnings (F1) and price-sales (P/S) ratios are higher than the respective industry averagesBottom LineDespite a solid start in 2017, a fresh round of food-safety fright has once again gripped the company in dilemma. Consequently, alarming questions have been raised over Chipotle’s turnaround in the near term.Notwithstanding various sales-building and strategic initiatives undertaken by the company, we particularly believe that a stretched valuation, negative estimates revision and renewed food-safety concerns limit the upside potential for the stock.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks from the same sector include McDonald's Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report), Restaurant Brands International Inc.

3237,CMG,"Troubles broiling in the U.S. restaurant industry over the past few quarters are known to all by now. Nevertheless, a gradually improving U.S. economy has reinforced consumer confidence and sentiment which is likely to encourage consumers to dine out more and thereby put a check on declining traffic.Thus, totally shying away from this space is not wise. In fact, there are a number of companies with a decent performance history and strong fundamentals that seem unperturbed, thereby signaling a profitable investment opportunity.One such company is McDonald’s Corp. (MCD  -  Free Report) that continues to reflect strength in several areas and should make a value addition to your portfolio.Notably, shares of this burger giant have gained 31.9% year to date compared with 8.5% growth of the industry it belongs to.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for McDonald’s current-year earnings has moved up 0.3%, reflecting eight upward revisions versus one downward, over the last 60 days. All these positive earnings estimate revision testifies to the unwavering confidence that analysts have in the company and substantiate the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.What Else Makes McDonald’s a Solid Pick?Earnings Growth & Surprise History: Arguably, nothing is more important than earnings growth as surging profit levels is often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company in question. For the year, the company’s projected EPS growth is 14.3% compared with the industry average of 7.3%.Moreover, McDonald’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate consistently over the last 12 consecutive quarters, with an average positive surprise of 7.44% in the trailing four quarters.Strong Brand Recognition: McDonald’s is the world’s largest fast-food chain, operating over 37,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries. Its offerings have reached the billion-dollar brand status through sustained product innovation and geographic expansion. With an almost 10% share of the global informal-eating-out market, there is ample scope for it to grow in the future as it boasts a scale advantage compared to its peers.Efforts to Boost Sales: Increasing guest count remains the company’s top priority and it intends to regain customers by focusing on food quality, convenience and value.On the digital front, McDonald’s is set to launch the option in nearly all 14,000 U.S. restaurants and 6,000 others in the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Australia and China by the end of this year, to better serve customers. Meanwhile, to provide augmented convenience, McDonald’s is increasingly focusing on expanding its delivery service. Also, it is accelerating Experience of the Future (EOTF) deployment in the United States which represents one of the greatest opportunities to build on business momentum, besides driving guest count.Notably, global comps at McDonald’s have been positive over the last eight consecutive quarters. Such moves are further expected to aid comps and maintain the momentum, going forward.Low Beta Stock: A stock with beta less than 1 suggests that its price movement is not highly correlated with the market. Since they are less volatile than the market, they are safer bets at the moment. McDonald’s has an impressive beta of 0.69. Therefore adding it to your portfolio will bring down overall beta, thereby reducing its risk.Our TakeDespite stiff competition from the likes of The Wendy's Company (WEN  -  Free Report), Restaurant Brands International Inc.’s (QSR  -  Free Report) Burger King and Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report), various sales and digital initiatives undertaken by the company are likely to aid it in transforming itself to a contemporary burger company.This, in turn, should help McDonald’s in retaining and even escalating its market share and strengthening its competitive position.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

3239,CMG,"On Friday, reports surfaced about three of America’s biggest retailers that detailed each was making further headway into the ultra-competitive online delivery space.Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report)Just weeks after the e-commerce giant finalized its acquisition of organic grocer Whole Foods, Amazon has announced a new partnership with Olo, a New York-based food delivery service. The up-and-coming delivery option provides digital order and pay technology to 200 restaurants like Applebee’s, Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report), Denny’s (DENN  -  Free Report), Shake Shack (SHAK  -  Free Report), and Wingstop (WING  -  Free Report).As part of the deal with, Olo’s clients would be listed on the Amazon Restaurants section of Amazon.com; Olo will then provide the tech that published menus and take orders while Amazon arranges deliveries. Amazon Restaurants has also implemented Rails, which is an Olo product that allows restaurants to take delivery orders from Amazon and other third-party services.Not only will this partnership help Olo’s customers connect with Amazon Restaurant’s delivery services, but it will also give Amazon’s customers access to more restaurant options.Shares of food delivery leader GrubHub (GRUB  -  Free Report) has taken a beating on the news, falling as much as 7% before regaining some ground; the stock is currently down about 3.3%.Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report)In a blog post, big box leader Walmart announced that it is testing a service that delivers groceries to your home, and unloads them for you straight to your refrigerator—even when you’re not home.Working with smart-lock startup August Home and same-day delivery service Deliv, Walmart customers can order groceries and other items online, and orders will then be securely brought in to their homes when ready. When the delivery person rings a customer’s doorbell, it triggers a smartphone notification, which you can then watch the delivery take place if you choose.Delivery associates enter a customer’s home by pressing a one-time, pre-authorized passcode into the smart lock; the worker would then carry groceries to the kitchen and unload them in the fridge, while any other items would be left by the front door.Walmart said the test will take place in Silicon Valley, with a small number of August Home users that have chosen to use the service. It is not clear how long this current test will last, or how this aspect of Walmart’s delivery program will evolve.Target (TGT  -  Free Report)Fellow big box frontrunner Target recently upped its delivery service game, with Target Restock offering city dwellers next-day delivery on everyday essentials ordered online.After testing the service over the summer, the company expanded Target Restock to eight additional cities, which makes it available to over 70 million people. It’s now available in Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco (coming mid-October), St. Louis, and the Washington, D.C./Baltimore, MD areas. Similar to Amazon’s Prime Pantry, customers can fill a box (up to 45 pounds) with typical household items—think laundry detergent and cleaning supplies—for a flat $4.99 fee; Amazon charges $5.99 per box. Another advantage: Target doesn’t charge an annual membership fee, and is available to any online Target shopper in the supported metropolitan regions.This is just one of the many new initiatives Target is trying out, and many seem to be hitting their mark; the company’s smaller format stores and in-house brands were a big reason for its better-than-expected results last quarter. And, Target Restock’s expansion is a sign that shoppers are consciously choosing Target over other online options for things like paper towels and other grocery-related items.Perhaps Amazon’s dominance is not as all-encompassing as it appears.Interested in the other top stories of the week?

3240,CMG,"Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG  -  Free Report) finished in the green after an impressive afternoon reversal on Tuesday. However, the stock briefly touched a new 52-week low during intraday trading, underscoring the challenges faced by investors as the market continues to grapple with the fast casual chain’s menu changes.Chipotle shares have had a rocky start to the week, during what many assumed would be a celebratory period for the company and its loyal customers. Indeed, the company’s long-awaited queso cheese has not had a perfect debut, which has frightened investors who felt the rollout of queso was a make-or-break moment for the struggling stock.Of course, a few harsh initial reviews does not necessarily spell disaster for the new offering. And regardless, plenty of investors will be interested in capitalizing from a rebound if Chipotle shares can bounce off their 52-week low.But will the stock recover soon, or is CMG doomed to slump even lower? Let’s take a closer look at the company’s fundamental picture in order to find out.The FundamentalsLet’s start out by diving into Chipotle’s growth prospects, because they are slightly misleading. Obviously, year-over-year EPS growth of 881% is staggering, and it is part of the reason the stock has earned an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. Our current consensus estimate is also calling for sales growth of 16% this year, which is certainly not a bad figure either.However, investors have to keep in mind that Chipotle’s year-over-year comparisons are inflated by the fact that the company was in the midst of its food safety scandal last year. As you’ll recall, the major foodborne illness breakouts were first reported in late-2015, and the fallout continued throughout 2016. Sure, these growth rates are notable, but Chipotle’s profits have still not returned to their pre-scandal levels.As we can see, despite its “A” for Value, CMG is currently sporting an overall VGM grade of “C.” This is because several other key fundamental metrics are relatively lackluster. The company is somewhat bleeding cash as it looks to spend get customers back through new promotions, and our traditional value metrics seem to imply that the stock might still be pricey.For example, CMG is trading at about 41x earnings, which really highlights how loose investors had been with this once-favored metric prior to the latest sell-off. Nevertheless, Chipotle’s P/S of 2.07 is more reasonable and could support the argument that the company’s business will be fine once it recovers from this downswing.Of course, we should also mention that Chipotle is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Remember, the Zacks Rank is heavily influenced by earnings estimate revisions, so let’s check out a quick snapshot of the revision activity we have seen for Chipotle recently:Unfortunately, this snapshot does not reveal a very encouraging picture for Chipotle either. As we can see, analyst sentiment has really turned south for the stock, especially for the current quarter. In fact, our Zacks Consensus Estimate for Chipotle’s current quarter earnings is now 29 cents lower than it was just 60 days ago—and that is coming on the back of universal negative revisions.Things look better for the next quarter, and even though the negative revisions have outnumbered the positive revisions, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has climbed by a penny. However, we’re still seeing strong agreement on the downside for the company’s full-year and next-year earnings estimates.Nevertheless, investors should note that Chipotle’s earnings growth and recovery is expected to continue next year. This observation really underscores our findings here, as it will come down each individual investor’s preferences right now.Will Chipotle return to its pre-scandal profit levels next year? It appears so. Does there appear to be some continued near-term challenges on the horizon? Yes.If you are a believer in Chipotle’s long-term growth, buying at this new 52-week low is probably a good decision. But if you’d rather sit out what could be a long and strenuous rebound, perhaps CMG should still be avoided.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

3241,CMG,"On Sep 5, we issued an updated research report on quick-casual and fresh Mexican food restaurant chains operator, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report).Throughout 2016 Chipotle’s results continued to be affected by the negative publicity related to the food-borne illnesses, which had surfaced toward 2015-end. Chipotle is thus leaving no stone unturned to reinvigorate investors’ confidence and regain its footing.Turnaround EffortsTo regain lost ground, Chipotle’s board of directors have discarded the co-CEO model and made Steve Ells the company’s sole Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in order to deal with the ongoing challenges in a better way. Ells particularly aims to focus on simplifying restaurant operations so as to offer improved service and healthier food to enhance guest experience and attract customers. Further, the company added four new members to rejuvenate its board.In addition, Chipotle aspires to strengthen its brand and recover sales by shifting strategies from giveaways, discounts and rewards to new menu items, simplification of restaurant operations, upgrade of guest experience, better operations including faster throughput and more aggressive brand marketing.The company strongly believes that there exists an opportunity to excite current customers and attract new ones through thoughtful menu development. In fact, given the early operational success it found with the queso offering, the company has expanded the test to more than 350 restaurants, in order to evaluate customer acceptance. If the results are positive, the company may even start with a national rollout as early as mid-September.The company is also likely to implement a menu price rise in the fourth quarter that should boost comps. Also, an increased focus on catering and delivery services might continue to augment the top line, going forward.Also, Chipotle is consistently attempting to make digital ordering more appealing to customers and more efficient for its restaurants with an objective to drive digital sales. Additionally, the company is on track to launch a new mobile app this year, comprising substantial improvements, to provide customers with a better quality digital experience. Though the developments are still in early days, the company is convinced to emerge a leader in digital ordering, given the momentum and positive customer reactions witnessed so far.Earlier in March, Chipotle had fulfilled its pledge of refraining from using colors, flavors or preservatives of any kind in any of its ingredients. Improvement in food handling, testing and food preparation procedures remains the company’s top priority. The company’s enhanced focus on making fresh, wholesome food accessible to everyone should also aid in bringing back health-conscious clients.HeadwindsChipotle started 2017 on a positive note, marking a turnaround as its sales finally began to bounce back from the massive food safety scandal that resulted in massive sales drop and denting of reputation.However, the recent closure of a Washington-area outlet due to an apparent norovirus alert has started a fresh round of food-safety scare. Presence of rodents was detected at a Dallas outlet, further adding to the woes. These might possibly hamper same-store sales, going forward.Also, Steve Ells’ qualms about the company’s ability to reach its previously announced guidance of high single digits rise in same-store sales and adjusted earnings per share of $10.00 in 2017, raises concerns.Additionally, high labor costs, rising avocado prices along with elevated marketing and promo expenses are expected to pose a threat to the restaurant chain’s profitability, while a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space might limit revenue growth.Additionally, the company currently faces stiff competition from the likes of Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report) owned Taco Bell and Jack in the Box Inc.’s (JACK  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Qdoba. This in turn lowers the brand’s ability to easily recover and return to its peak levels of 2014.Bottom LineDespite a strong start to the year, a fresh round of food-safety fright has once again gripped the company in dilemma.  As a result, alarming questions have been raised over the company’s turnaround.Chipotle’s shares have evidently sunk 32.3% in the last three months compared with the industry’s fall of 6.3%.Nevertheless, the company’s continued focus on food safety, simplification of restaurant operations, menu innovation, improved digital offerings and increased brand marketing bode well for growth.Thus, though Chipotle is on the road to recovery, we believe, it will take some time for the company to completely restore its economic model as well as customers’ trust and return to its former glory.Chipotle currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in this industry is Papa John’s International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report), holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In the trailing four quarters, Papa John’s delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 5.10%.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

3242,CMG,"After announcing the shutdown of 379 stand-alone Teavana stores last month, Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) plans to close its online operations on Oct 1.Although there was no announcement from the company, a representative confirmed the same to Business Insider. Starbucks’ website currently offers discounts on various products as part of a liquidation sale till the beginning of October.The online store offers products like glasses, mugs, coffee brewers, and espresso makers along with coffee, tea and beverage syrups. The products are still available through third-party sellers like Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Starbucks’ other grocery partners. Meanwhile, the company will keep its online customers updated on product availability.Notably, Starbucks has been planning on partnerships with digital companies to expand its brand and global retail footprint to reach more customers. The company also plans to further integrate digital and mobile transaction to its business model as mobile payments constitute 30% of Starbucks orders in the United States.Soft consumer spending and growing popularity of online shopping require the company to strengthen its digital capabilities.However, due to the challenging macroeconomic environment in the U.S. restaurant space, Starbucks, along with many of its peers like Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report) and Darden Restaurants, Inc. (DRI  -  Free Report) has been facing a difficult sales environment.--Over the past few months, the U.S. restaurants are witnessing a shift in consumer demand, which has adversely affected the sales performance of the company. Moreover witnessing its fiscal third quarter as well as the initial fourth quarter, Starbucks now is somewhat bearish for the remainder of fiscal 2017. This has partially resulted in a downward revision of the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s earnings. Over the past 60 days, current quarter and year earnings estimates have declined 6.8% and 2.4%, respectively.Additionally, the company’s shares have massively underperformed the industry year to date. The stock has lost 2.5%, as against the 6.3% gain of the industry.Nevertheless, Starbucks is introducing many technological innovations to strengthen its brand.

3243,CMG,"Investors in Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jun 29, 2018 $465.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Chipotle shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Chipotle is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Retail – Restaurants industry that ranks in the Top 38% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, two analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $2.67 per share to $2.71 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Chipotle right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

3245,CMG,"Dave & Buster’s Entertainment, Inc. (PLAY  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jun 11, after market close. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.4%. The bottom line also outpaced the consensus mark in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 16.5%.Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at earnings estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the release. Notably, the consensus estimate has been stable in the last 30 days. For the quarter under review, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 93 cents. This reflects an improvement of 6.9% from 87 cents in the year-ago quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $322.3 million, up 6% year over year.Factors at PlayDave & Buster's unique business model with increased dependence on gaming is impressive.  We expect the company’s entertainment business to carry the momentum forward. Consistent efforts to improve sales and margins through various initiatives have also been key growth drivers. In this regard, continual opening of stores, menu innovation and launch of games are anticipated to continue boosting its top and bottom line.Furthermore, menu innovation remains a key attribute of the brand and guests have responded favorably to it. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, Dave & Buster’s also appointed new vice president of Food and Beverage development in order to improve speed of service through menu redesign and positive simplification in the kitchen area. In February, the company streamlined its menu and reduced the number of food orders by about 20% and beverage offerings by 12% to achieve increased efficiency.Meanwhile, the company continues to evolve its amusement strategy backed by new and riveting content, including games based on some of the world’s finest movie properties. In this regard, Dave & Buster’s is consistently collaborating with various game manufacturing partners and remains steadfast on its strategy of including proprietary content exclusive to the company forever.However, rising labor costs and a non-franchised business model might hurt profits. In fact, the non-franchised model makes the company susceptible to increased expenses. Since all the restaurants are owned and operated by Dave & Buster’s, instead of signing franchise agreements and putting the burden of costs on the franchisee, the company is solely responsible for the expenses of operating the business.Dave & Buster's Entertainment, Inc.

3247,CMG,"Zoe's Kitchen, Inc.  is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 24, after market close.The company’s earnings surprise history has not been impressive, as it delivered an average negative surprise of 38.89% in the trailing four quarters. Also, estimates for the to-be-reported quarter have moved from break-even earnings to a loss of a penny in the past month, indicating analysts’ doubt surrounding the future potential of the company’s earnings.Moreover, Zoe’s Kitchen’s shares have lost 8.5% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 3.7%.Factors Likely to Shape Up First-Quarter ResultsThe company’s total revenues in 2017 increased 13.8% year over year on several unit openings.The trend is likely to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well, buoyed by consistent unit expansion, along with the increased focus on catering and delivery services. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $105.09 million, reflecting 16% year-over-year growth.The company is investing heavily on menu innovation, which is likely to have aided its revenues in the to-be-reported quarter as well. In 2017, Zoe’s Kitchen completed the largest menu rollout that featured Lamb Kafta, bowls with cauliflower rice and power grains, revamped pita sandwiches, and four new sauces highlighting Mediterranean ingredients and flavors.However, menu innovation and the increased focus on other operations are also weighing on the company’s margins. Moreover, owing to increased labor and other operating costs, the company witnessed a 16.1% year-over-year increase in operating expenses in 2017, and the trend is likely to have continued in the first quarter as well. Profits in the to-be-reported quarter, therefore, are likely to have been hurt.Subsequently, the consensus estimate for the first quarter predicts a loss of a penny, suggesting a 200% decline from the year-ago quarter.Peer ReleasesDarden (DRI  -  Free Report), carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), reported mixed third-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues lagged the same.

Franchise EBITDA was 59.8%, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 140 bps.

In second-quarter fiscal 2018, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12.8%.Q3 ExpectationsThe question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Cracker Barrel will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.93, lower than $1.95 reported in the year-ago quarter. Of late, the company’s earnings estimates have been stable. In second-quarter fiscal 2018, it witnessed earnings growth of 24.7% on a year-over-year basis.Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of nearly $715.2 million, up 2.1% from the prior-year quarter.Let’s delve deeper to find out how the company’s top and bottom line will shape up this earnings season.Factors at PlayCracker Barrel’s top line in the quarter is likely to be driven by unit expansion, menu innovation, increased focus on retail business and seasonal promotions. As part of menu innovation, the company introduced crafted coffee in about 350 stores by the end of the fiscal second quarter. The company believes that the platform will complement the strength of its breakfast all day offering, drive check favorability and promote guest perceptions of menu variety.The company is stressing on growth in its off-premise business. It is introducing a catering menu and in-store training of hourly employees to enhance business. Anticipating off-premise sales to be the primary source of full-year sales, the company is investing in marketing efforts like social and digital messaging, geo-targeted consumer emails and in-store collateral.In order to drive traffic, Cracker Barrel relies heavily on seasonal promotions and limited-time offers to boost its top-line performance as these are appealing to both regular users and less-frequent guests. In fiscal 2018, the company aims to meet consumers' needs for convenience via growth in its off-premise business. In fact, the company plans to enhance its off-premise platform by introducing new catering menu offering and in-store training of hourly employees.However, the company’s bottom line is likely to be impacted by an increase in cost of goods sold owing to commodity inflation. Nevertheless, Cracker Barrel has a wide range of cost-cutting mechanisms in place. The company altered its retail sales and service structure in a way that allows it to deploy fewer associates during the outlet’s low-volume hours, thereby reducing in-store hourly labor by 25-30 hours per week. Notably, for fiscal 2018, the company is attempting to deliver between $7 and $8 million in annual cost savings.Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc.

3250,CMG,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.’s (CMG  -  Free Report) increased focus on food safety, and various sales-building and strategic initiatives are major positives amid a tough economic environment characterized by high costs and stiff competition. Recently, the company reported first-quarter 2018 results, wherein earnings surpassed analysts’ expectations while revenues were in line with the same. Adjusted earnings of $2.13 grew 33.1% from the year-ago quarter driven by higher revenues and lower food costs.Chipotle had a good share of negative publicity throughout 2016 due to an issue of food-borne illnesses that surfaced toward 2015-end. As a safety measure, the company was forced to close several outlets. Ever since then, this fast-casual Mexican chain has been undertaking aggressive efforts to restore its economic model as well as regain customer trust. To this end, Chipotle discarded its earlier co-CEO model and recently appointed former Yum! Brands' (YUM  -  Free Report) executive, Brian Niccol as the new CEO. Niccol’s expertise in restaurant operations, digital technologies and branding has significantly helped Chipotle in first-quarter earnings.Also, Chipotle’s shares have gained 49.8% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 1.9%. Earnings estimates for the current year have also increased 2.3% over the past month, reflecting analysts’ optimism surrounding the company’s future earnings potential.Increased Focus on Safety & Cleanliness to Drive CustomersAs part of its revival strategy and efforts to regain consumer trust, Chipotle fulfilled its pledge of using no added colors, flavors or preservatives of any kind in all its ingredients. In fact, the company now makes use of only 51 real ingredients to prepare its food, which is in stark contrast to most other fast food chains. Chipotle is also focusing on developing new food-safety protocols that include DNA-based testing of several ingredients, coupled with changes in food preparation and food-handling practices. The company is also undertaking noteworthy steps to reduce the amount of food and packaging waste to be disposed in landfills and has increased its diversion rate from 31% in 2015 to 40% in 2017. Recently as announced, Chipotle is implementing practices like minimal food-waste disposal during the preparation process, recycling as well as compost programs for food packages, use of reusable lids replacing plastic wraps and participation in the Harvest Program to donate its leftover food to local communities.Enhancing Digital Capabilities to Drive SalesChipotle is prioritizing its e-commerce program to appeal a greater number of customers and drive sales. To this end, the company has redesigned and simplified its online ordering site, enabled online payment for catering, online meal customizations and collaborated with several well-known third-party providers for delivery. In the first quarter, the company hit new records as digital sales mix was 8.8% of the total sales and grew 20% year over year. Also, since the rollout of its “Smarter Pickup Times” technology, there has been a significant increase in digital orders and higher guest satisfaction. As the company’s digital orders are made on a second make-line, it allows the company to deliver excellent throughput and enhance the experience of customers who are increasingly shifting to digital ordering.In 2018, the company plans to accelerate the rollout of second make-lines, which will enable a faster, more accurate experience for digital customers and allow the restaurant crews to support higher sales volumes. The company expects at least 30% of its restaurants to be endowed with these new second make-lines by the end of 2018.High Costs and Stiff Competition Remain ConcernsChipotle’s continued efforts to connect with its customers in order to retrieve their trust and loyalty, as well as bring them back to its stores on the back of high marketing and promo expenses, have been hurting its profitability. Moreover, the company is incurring additional costs to support its newly-designed food safety program. In addition to wages, Chipotle is also facing high labor costs from training its workers to aptly implement food-safety practices.Also, competition from fast-casual, quick-service and casual dining restaurateurs like BJ’s Restaurants (BJRI  -  Free Report) and El Pollo Loco (LOCO  -  Free Report) is expected to remain fierce with respect to price, food quality, service, location and concept, which may impact Chipotle’s operating margins and profits, going forward.Chipotle currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

In the quarter, the company reported adjusted loss of 4 cents, wider than the consensus estimate of 2 cents but narrower than the prior-year quarter’s loss of 8 cents.Meanwhile, revenues of $110.5 million surpassed the consensus mark of $109.1 million by 1.3% but fell 5.3% year over year. The decline in revenues was primarily due to the closure of 55 restaurants during the year-ago quarter, partially offset by restaurant opening since the beginning of 2017.Comps in the quarter were also affected by a shift in the timing of the Easter holiday. System-wide first-quarter comps declined 0.2% and that of company-owned restaurants fell 0.3%. Comps at Noodles & Company’s franchise restaurants however increased 0.9%.Notably, Noodles & Company has been bearing the brunt of soft consumer demand and declining comps over the past few quarters. Despite its major sales building initiatives like streamlining of menu and innovation, the introduction of new cooking procedures, effective marketing strategy, increased focus on the off-premise business and investments in technology-driven initiatives like digital ordering, it has recorded negative comps in each of the trailing four quarters in 2017 and also in the first quarter of 2018.Meanwhile, high costs from restaurant operation and increased labor expenses might have been a potential threat to Noodles & Company’s earnings.

3253,CMG,"Per a research note from Credit Suisse, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.’s (CMG  -  Free Report) profitability might be severely affected in the near-term, given a recent surge in avocado prices.Though the investment firm maintained its neutral rating on this quick-casual and fresh Mexican food restaurant chain operator, it lowered its price target by 4.5% to $320 from $335.Moreover, Credit Suisse slashed its estimates for Chipotle’s 2017 and 2018 earnings per share (EPS) to $6.38 and $9.57, respectively, down from $6.95 and $9.71. Also, for the third quarter, the firm expects adjusted earnings per share to come in at $1.15. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.84 per share is pegged well above the guidance.What’s the Fuss About?Notably, avocado is the central ingredient in guacamole. Credit Suisse analysts Jason West and Jordy Winslow note that avocado prices have amplified about 75% since mid-July and are up about 50% year over year, given shortages in Mexico and a weaker harvest in California, which are two of the largest suppliers of the green fruit.Per the analysts’ estimates, avocados make up nearly 10% of Chipotle’s cost of goods sold. Therefore, they are of the view that every 10% increase in avocado prices impacts Chipotle’s restaurant margins by 30 basis points and EPS by about 30 cents, or 4%. The spike thus puts pressure on Chipotle’s food costs, which in turn, is likely to dent profits.Earlier, at its second-quarter conference call, management anticipated avocado prices to moderate in the rest of the year, besides expecting a 20% drop in prices moving into the second half of 2017.However, as per the firm, the avocado prices are now likely be up 10% and 25% in the third and fourth quarter, respectively, which could potentially cut off 25 cents, or 13%, of the third-quarter consensus earnings per share estimates, and 35 cents, or 20%, in the fourth quarter.Though Chipotle is possibly the biggest fast-food chain to feel the heat of the rising avocado prices, other restaurants serving guacamole, including Yum! Brands Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report) owned Taco Bell and Moe's Southwest Grill have also come under the scanner.Bottom LineChipotle started 2017 on a positive note, marking a turnaround as its sales finally started bouncing back from the massive food safety scandal related to the E.coli and norovirus outbreak, which surfaced toward 2015 end, and resulted in sales plunging and hurting its reputation.Additionally, the company’s continued focus on food safety, simplification of restaurant operations, menu innovation (possible roll out of queso), improved digital offerings and increased brand marketing bode well for growth.However, the recent closure of a Washington-area outlet due to an apparent norovirus alert has started a fresh round of food-safety scare. Evidence of rodents was found at a Dallas outlet, further adding to the woes. These might possibly dent same-store sales, going forward. Alongside, rising avocado prices also pose a threat to the restaurant chain's profitability.Evidently, Chipotle shares have declined 35.7% in the last three months compared with the industry’s fall of 5.1%.Thus, given potentially soft comps along with material implications on margins and earnings from higher avocado prices, we would like to remain on the sidelines in the near term. This is because it seems that the company will certainly take some time to completely restore its economic model as well as customers’ trust and return to its former glory.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderChipotle currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3254,CMG,"The Wendy's Company (WEN  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected results in the first quarter of 2018. Adjusted earnings of 11 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 10 cents by 10%. The bottom line also increased 37.5% year over year, primarily favored by the positive effect of lower tax rate related to share-based payments along with Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Increased revenues also drove earnings.Quarterly revenues of $380.6 million topped the consensus mark of $380 million by 0.2%. The top line improved 5.4% from the year-ago quarter driven by increased rental revenues related to Franchise Flips completed in 2017. Revenues also gained from positive comps recorded from both company-operated and franchise-operated restaurants. However, comps for North American system were affected by adverse weather conditions, which partially dented the overall top line of the company.Meanwhile, comps at the North America system restaurants were up 1.6% compared with an increase of 1.3% in the last reported quarter and 1.6% in first-quarter 2017.The Wendy's Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  The Wendy's Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Wendy's Company QuoteDespite the earnings beat, shares of Wendy’s have declined 3.5% in after-hour trading on May 8.

The 210-basis points (bps) decline was primarily caused by higher commodity and labor costs, partially offset by pricing actions.General and administrative expenses in the first quarter were $50.4 million, down 1.9% from $51.3 million recorded in the prior-year quarter. The decline reflected lower professional fees.First-quarter operating profit amounted to $55.3 million, a 4.3% decline from the year-ago quarter’s figure of $57.7 million. Net income of $20.2 million declined 1.6% year over year.Adjusted EBITDA increased 5.4% from the prior-year quarter primarily from revenue growth, including net rental income, partially offset by a decrease in company-operated restaurant margin.

However, comps compared favorably with the prior-quarter decline of 1.5% and year-ago drop of 2.3%.Comps at Chili's franchised restaurants went down 2.1% compared with a 2.5% decline in the year-ago quarter and 1% drop in the last quarter.

3260,CMG,"McDonald's Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 results, wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.79 outpaced the consensus mark of $1.67 by 7.2% and improved 22% from the year-ago quarter (16% in constant currencies). The upside reflects stronger operating performance.Meanwhile, foreign currency translation had a positive impact of 8 cents per share on earnings in the quarter. Notably, adjusted earnings exclude the impact of a net tax cost associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.Following the quarterly results, shares of the company increased 4% in pre-market trading session. However, in the past three months, the stock has declined 7.5% compared with industry’s decrease of 1.6%.Revenues Decline But Global Comps ImproveRevenues of $ 5,138.9 million outpaced the consensus mark of $4,915 million by 4.5% but declined 9% year over year. The downturn reflects the impact of the company’s strategic refranchising initiative.Revenues at company-operated restaurants were down 26% year over year to $2,535.6 million. However, the same at franchise-operated restaurants increased 15% to $2,603.3 million.Global comps grew 5.5% supported by encouraging guest count across segments. This marked the eleventh consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales. Meanwhile, comps rise was similar to growth in the fourth-quarter 2017.Solid Comps Across SegmentsU.S.: Comps grew 2.9% in the first quarter owing to increase in average check resulting from rise in menu price as well as product mix shift. Comps growth, however, was lower than the prior-quarter rise of 4.5%.Segment operating income increased 5% backed by higher sales-driven franchised margin dollars and increase in sales from restaurant businesses, partially offset by lower company-operated margin dollars.International Lead Markets: Comps at this segment grew 7.8% year over year, higher than a 6% rise witnessed in the last reported quarter. Robust sales in the United Kingdom and Germany along with upbeat results across all other markets drove comps.McDonald's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise McDonald's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | McDonald's Corporation QuoteOperating income was up 21%, including the impact of foreign currency translation. At constant currency, the figure was up 9% primarily on the back of sales-driven improvements in franchised margin dollars.High-Growth Markets: Comps grew 4.7%, which was higher than the prior-quarter’s increase of 4%. The uptick can be attributed to strong performance in China and Italy as well as positive results across majority of the segments, partially offset by continual challenges in South Korea.Foundational Markets: Comps in Foundational Markets grew 8.7% on the back of positive sales performance across all geographic regions. Moreover, the figure came in higher than 8% growth in the last reported quarter.Zacks Rank & Peer ReleasesMcDonald's carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3261,CMG,"McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) last-reported results were encouraging with the company bettering our expectations on both top and bottom lines. Shares are also trending up as seen in the chart below:But to understand whether this was just a one-time thing or part of a broader recovery, let’s look for a moment at what was bothering the company in the first place.The way I see it, there were two main problems that led to the decline in its share of the market from 17.5% five years ago to 15.1% last year, according to Euromonitor. The first was an inability to capture an equal share of millennial traffic as it had of earlier generations. The second is related to the persistent weakness in Asian markets, particularly China.Of course, strategic refranchising makes headline numbers erratic and comparisons difficult because closing down company-owned stores is a big hit to revenues that can’t be offset by the 6% commission on sales from franchised stores. But at the end of the day, it makes sense, because both capital and operational expenses are thus taken out, with a resultant positive impact on profitability.In this respect, other fast food chains have already moved to a model where around 95% of the stores are franchised; so McDonald’s, being slightly late to react, will continue to enjoy some near-term positive impact that may not be seen in the others.Targeting MillennialsMillennials are generally more concerned about health, convenience, responsible sourcing and freshness of ingredients. And these are areas the company is doubling down on.In what is a complete reversal of earlier policy, management announced the intention to use fresh beef instead of frozen patties. Being somewhat more difficult to handle, this increases the risk of microbe buildup and food borne disease, but the strategy has given Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG  -  Free Report) an advantage so it’s worth trying out. McDonald’s isn’t taking this to all products at once, which sounds like a good idea.  Other menu changes include a reduction in the use of artificial preservatives, colors and flavors, HFCS-free buns and antibiotics-free chicken, in addition to the Premium Salads refresh, the margarine replacement with butter in Egg McMuffins, milk products from growth hormone-free cows and localized menu options that were announced earlier. In the pipeline is 100% cage-free eggs by 2025 in the U.S. and Canada.On the convenience side, the company is working on putting up digital sign boards, facilitating mobile ordering, tables with serving staff as in fast casual restaurants in some places, curbside service and delivery options both by its own staff and through partnerships with companies like GrubHub (GRUB  -  Free Report). It will also have 2,500 Experience of the Future (EOTF) stores by year-end, meaning that that’s the number of stores that will have Samsung tablets on the table or in kiosks that customers can use to order or communicate with staff.Stealing from the CompetitionMcDonald’s figures that not everyone is that health conscious however, so it seeks to lure in the diet cheaters as well. Not to mention those that would otherwise have gone to a Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) or a Dunkin’ (DNKN  -  Free Report) outlet instead. In the 2-5 PM timeframe that has always been quiet for quick service restaurants, McDonald’s is laying out croissants, muffin tops and a new sundae-topping station for ice cream lovers. It also has special offers on drinks that can be purchased for as low as $1-2.Plus there are seasonal-themed coffees and environmentally friendly coffee beans (a page out of Starbucks). For this purpose, McDonald’s is getting 12,000 new espresso machines, store redesigns and stepping up marketing efforts. The goal is clear: McDonald’s may be looking out for the health conscious, but it isn’t about to dump those wanting to indulge.Looking for Growth in ChinaChina is part of McDonald's “fast growing” segment, but it hasn’t been growing too fast of late. Changing customer perceptions following the stale meat scandal had a notable impact on not only McDonald’s but also on Yum Brands (YUM  -  Free Report). Chinese fast food chains in the meantime have gained some ground. Families in particular have moved on from Brand America to other things like food quality, so they are frequenting the fast casual segment these days. But office goers are reportedly coming back.McDonald’s isn’t taking chances. Just as it has done in other Asian markets like Japan (3,000 outlets), South Korea (600) and Taiwan (400), the company is transferring an 80% interest in 2,000 Chinese outlets to CITIC Limited, CITIC Capital Partners and The Carlyle Group for 10 years. In return, it’s getting a cool $2.08 billion from the largest franchisee outside the U.S.There are ambitious plans afoot, with the group targeting double-digit growth in each of the next five years by increasing the number of restaurants from 2,500 to 4,500. By 2022, it also intends to bring delivery hub coverage to over 75% of restaurants. This therefore looks like a very good deal by which McDonald’s is refranchising the business, acquiring local talent and catering to local preferences in a highly profitable way.  Last WordsTo ensure that all goes smoothly, McDonald’s has brought in Morgan Flatley (formerly CMO of Global Nutrition at Pepsico, responsible for getting Gatorade back to sustained growth), as U.S. Chief Marketing Officer; Farhan Siddiqi, as Head of U.S. Digital (formerly worked at Bank of America, Target and GE); and Linda Van Gosen (formerly VP at Startbucks, responsible for Starbucks Evenings, VP of Brand Strategy, Insights and Menu Innovation at TGI Friday’s and VP of Product Innovation at Chili’s Grill & Bar) as new Head of U.S. Menu.Given the above and the possibility of President Trump’s tax reforms kicking in, Mc Donald’s is set for a rebound. So if results are beginning to look up at McDonald’s it’s very likely an indication of more to come.McDonald’s shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3262,CMG,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 10.7% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Chipotle Tops Q2 Earnings Estimates, Revenues LagChipotle reported second-quarter 2017 earnings per share (EPS) of $2.32, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.16 by 7.4%. The figure also increased significantly from the prior-year quarter earnings of 87 cents, given a substantial rise in revenues.Total revenue rose 17.1% from the year-ago quarter to $1.17 billion driven by new restaurant openings and solid comps growth. However, revenues missed the consensus mark of $1.18 billion by over 1%.Behind the Headline NumbersComps grew 8.1% in the quarter. The increase was mainly on the back of improved customer traffic, along with an increase in average check given reduced promotional activity. However, the comps rise was lower than the prior-quarter growth of 17.8%.Meanwhile, food costs, as a percentage of revenues, decreased 10 bps to 34.1% given reduction in food waste, improvements in the company’s food safety procedures, lower paper and packaging costs as well as benefit of menu price increases in select restaurants, somewhat offset by higher avocado prices.General and administrative expenses comprised 6% of the total revenue, reflecting a decrease of 110 bps year over year, chiefly due to sales leverage.Restaurant level operating margin was 18.8%, up 330 bps from 15.5% recorded in the year-ago quarter. The upside was primarily driven by sales leverage coupled with more efficient scheduling and deployment of the company’s managers and crew.Marketing and promotional expenses, as a percentage of revenues, decreased 70 bps to 3.7% due to lower promotional costs and sales leverage.Guidance for 2017Chipotle reiterated its previously announced guidance for full-year 2017 as comps are still projected to increase in high single digits. Meanwhile, new restaurant openings are anticipated in the range of 195–210.Currently, the company expects G&A to be in the $290 million range for the year, slightly lower than previous guidance of $300 million.It is also working toward its stretch goal of achieving adjusted earnings per share of $10.00 and restaurant level operating margin of 20% for the year.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been eight revisions lower for the current quarter. While looking back an additional 30 days, we can see even more downside. There have been 12 moves down in the last two months. In the past month, the consensus estimate has shifted lower by 17.4% due to these changes.Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price and Consensus  Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.

3263,CMG,"Zoe’s Kitchen, Inc.  reported break-even results in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 2 cents. Moreover, earnings deteriorated considerably from the year-ago figure of 6 cents owing to lower restaurant contribution margin.Revenues of $74.3 million lagged the consensus mark of $75 million by nearly 1% but improved 12.1% year over year backed by new restaurant openings.  Zoe’s Kitchen still expects to open 38 to 40 company-owned restaurants this yearNotably, the company’s shares have declined over 4% in afterhours trading on Aug 17, mirroring investors’ concerns surrounding the weak results and sluggish comps.Behind the Headline NumbersComparable restaurant sales decreased 3.8%, given a 5% decrease in transactions and product mix, partially offset by a 1.2% price hike. The challenging restaurant environment continued to affect comps.Consequently, the figure compared unfavorably with the prior-quarter’s comps decline of 3.3% and the year-ago quarter’s growth of 4%.Restaurant contribution margin went down 260 basis points (bps) year over year to 19% as increased labor and operating expenses eroded the improvement in cost of goods.Zoe's Kitchen, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Zoe's Kitchen, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Zoe's Kitchen, Inc. Quote2017 Fiscal Outlook ReaffirmedFor fiscal 2017, the company expects total revenue in the band of $314 million to $322 million, same as the previous guided range.Also, it continues to project comp sales of flat to negative 3%.Furthermore, the company predicts restaurant contribution margin in the range of 18.3% to 19% (same as earlier guidance).Despite weak fiscal second quarter results, the company expects to meet its full-year guidance on the improved quarter-to-date trend. The company is particularly positive on recent menu innovation, re-platformed website and scheduled launch of its mobile app and loyalty programs by the end of fiscal third quarter. It thus expects these strategic measures along with the infrastructure initiatives completed earlier this year to drive results in the second half of fiscal 2017.We note that Zoe’s Kitchen currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Peer ReleasesChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.’s (CMG  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $2.32 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.16 by 7.4%.

The stocks were bid up as investors bought into the growth plans of many of the regional chains.But in 2017, these companies were hit with a new reality of rising costs, especially in labor and food, along with a competitive landscape.The restaurant bubble has popped. Many of the restaurant stocks are down double digits for the year.Do New Lows = Value?Consider Noodles & Company (NDLS  -  Free Report). Shares are down 44% year-to-date and are trading at new all-time lows.After it’s 2013 IPO, shares were as high as $45. They’re now trading under $5.It’s not expected to be profitable this year as the 2017 estimate is calling for a loss of $0.01.Is this a value stock or a value trap?Definition of a Value TrapRemember, a value trap can look a lot like a value stock. It might have a low P/E or P/B ratio. Shares may be hitting new lows. It might be in an industry getting the cold shoulder from Wall Street.But a value stock will also have solid earnings, which are on the rise. A value trap will have declining earnings.Tracey took a look to see if her favorite restaurant chains were a buying opportunity yet. She ran a screen that included just the restaurant industry and stocks with a P/E under 15.There are 79 restaurant chains in Zacks “retail-restaurants” category.Only 6 names came up which indicates that the industry is still “expensive” even with the stocks pulling back.3 Restaurant Stocks: Are They a Value Stock or a Value Trap?1.      Brinker International (EAT  -  Free Report) operates Chili’s and Maggiano’s Little Italy. Shares are down 35% year-to-date. Brinker’s forward P/E is just 10.8 but what do the earnings estimates look like? Are they rising?2.     Dine Equity (DIN  -  Free Report) operates IHOP and Applebee’s. Second quarter was rough as it announced it was going to close between 105-135 Applebee’s and 20-25 IHOPs. Shares are down 47% year-t0-date. It has a forward P/E of 8.6. Is it a value stock or a value trap?3.     Bojangles (BOJA  -  Free Report), the southeast regional fried chicken chain, saw lower same-store-sales last quarter. Shares have fallen 19% year-to-date and it now trades with a forward P/E of 16.3. Is this a buying opportunity?Tracey also took a look at other restaurant companies that don’t yet have value fundamentals but whose shares are weak.Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report), for instance, is now trading at a 4-year low. Shares are down 32% in the last 3 months.It currently trades with a forward P/E of 41 so it’s nowhere close to being a value even with the stock sell off.But would it be a trap?The key is those earnings estimates. Are they being cut or is the growth there for investors to keep it on their short list?Find out the answer to this and more on this week’s podcast.Want more value investing insights from Tracey?

3265,CMG,"Famous Dave’s of America, Inc.  reported mixed second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 14, after the market closed. While, earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues lagged the same.Shares of the company gained 11.4% in the first full-trading session following the results.Earnings and Revenue DiscussionFamous Dave’s fiscal second-quarter adjusted earnings of 16 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 9 cents by 77.8%. However, the bottom line declined 15.8% year over year due to lower revenues.Revenues of $25.3 million were down 8.8% year over year as company-owned net restaurant sales as well as franchise royalty and fee revenues declined. Also, the top line came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26 million by 2.9%.Famous Dave's of America, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Famous Dave's of America, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Famous Dave's of America, Inc. QuoteBehind the Headline NumbersSystem-wide comps fell 3% due to a decrease in comps at both company-operated and franchise restaurants.Company-operated restaurant sales were $21 million compared with $23 million in the year-ago quarter. The decline of nearly 9% in the sales was fueled by the decrease in comps and the net closure of five restaurants since the end of second-quarter fiscal 2016.Notably, comps at company-operated restaurants decreased 2.2% comparing favorably with the prior-year quarter decline of 6.4%, and the previous quarter’s decline of 3.3%.Meanwhile, franchise royalty revenues decreased about 9% year over year, driven by the net closure of seven franchise restaurants since the year-ago quarter, and a decline in comps. This was partially offset by franchise fee revenues earned from the opening of one franchise-operated restaurant in the reported quarter.It is to be noted that comps at franchise restaurants were down 3.2% in the quarter. This reported figure was better than a 4.3% decline recorded in the prior-year quarter, and 4.8% decrease in the previous quarter.Restaurant-level operating margin for company-owned restaurants fell 130 basis points year over year to 8.2%. This lower margin was mainly driven by sales deleverage on fixed labor and operating costs, partially offset by lower food and beverage costs.Remarkably, general and administrative (G&A) expenses declined to $3.5 million from $4.5 million in the prior-year period. This year-over-year decrease was a result of the company’s continued optimization of its G&A structure to be commensurate with that of a dedicated franchisor, a decline in professional fees and reduced costs incurred for franchise-related matters.Notably, given the challenging sales environment in the U.S. restaurants space as well as prevailing inflationary pressures across the industry, Famous Dave’s is focused on tightly managing all the costs and expenses in its immediate control.Refranchising and Restaurant Optimization PlanOn May 2, Famous Dave’s announced plans to accelerate the refranchising and optimization of its company-operated restaurants over the next 12 to 24 months. In keeping with this strategy, it has closed six underperforming restaurants to date.According to the company, this initiative is likely to “permit the company to shift its resources and energy to the growth and support of its franchise system, which are paramount to the company’s success”.Zacks Rank & Peer ReleasesFamous Dave’s currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3268,CMG,"Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. (RRGB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 22, after market close.In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 41.8%. Also, the same outpaced the consensus mark by an average of 23.2% in three of the trailing four quarters.Q1 ExpectationsThe question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Red Robin will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at 74 cents, lower than 89 cents in the year-ago quarter. Of late, the company’s earnings estimates have been stable. In the fourth quarter of 2017, it witnessed earnings growth of 122.9% on a year-over-year basis.Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of nearly $430.6 million, up 2.9% from the prior-year quarter.Let’s delve deeper to find out how the company’s top and bottom line will shape up this earnings season.Factors at PlayIn the first quarter, Red Robin’s revenues are likely to be driven by robust sales building initiatives. To drive sales, the company has improved its seating efficiency and lowered guests’ waiting times. Moreover, Red Robin’s remodeling initiatives are expected to boost its potential as a brand and improve guest experience, which in turn, should drive revenues. Among the brand revitalization initiatives, the company is focused on menu innovation, operational improvement and making a better customer service platform. Also, it continues to launch a variety of salads, appetizers, innovative desserts and adult beverages as well as kids’ menu.Apart from focusing on unit expansion to boost traffic, Red Robin is expanding its off-premise online-ordering business via carry-out, delivery and catering. In fact, the increasing demand for off-premise orders is already reflecting in its business as they ring in at a higher total check. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company delivered 8.3% mix in off-premise, up 45% year over year.However, Red Robin’s earnings are expected to decline sharply from the prior-year quarter tally. This reflects the loss of one high volume revenue week as compared with a year ago. In addition, rising costs might hurt the company’s margin in the quarter to be reported. Meanwhile, Red Robin is investing heavily in several sales building initiatives like advertising and technical upgrades, which should result in elevated costs. Remodeling and restaurant maintenance also add to the already rising expenses.Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not show that Red Robin is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Red Robin has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

Adjusted earnings of $1.71 per share increased 29.5% year over year on the back of higher revenues.Restaurant Brands’ (QSR  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings and revenues outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

Adjusted earnings of $2.13 per share surged 33.1% from the year-ago quarter, courtesy of higher revenues and lower food costs.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

3269,CMG,"Shake Shack (SHAK  -  Free Report) and Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report) are two of the most prominent “fast casual” restaurants within their industry. Both companies have seen prolific growth in recent years and within the past month released their Q1 earnings reports. Let’s take a look and see which company outperformed the other.Income and RevenueChipotle posted adjusted earnings of $2.13 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate, and revenues of $1.15 billion, meeting the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Shake Shack posted earnings of $0.13 per share and revenues of $99.1 million, both beating the Zacks Consensus Estimates.BreakdownChipotle put up impressive numbers in the first quarter, including a 38% beat in earnings estimates, and 33% earnings growth year-over-year. The company saw a strong 7.4% year-over-year increase in revenue. Same store sales growth touched 2.2%.This success follows a string of food-borne illness allegations and problems associated with the company since its first issue in 2015, a national E.coli outbreak, up until its last issue in 2017, a norovirus outbreak.Shake Shack has been booming in recent months, beating both consensus estimates and reporting Q1 revenues that were 29% greater than that of last year. The company saw “same Shack” sales growth of 1.7% in the quarter. Earnings increased more than 44% from the prior-year quarter.Although it may seem that Shake Shack clearly outranks Chipotle based on its earnings and revenue growth rates, one must consider their relative position within the market and within their own growth cycles.Chipotle is a large-cap company, with a market capitalization of just over $10 billion. Large-cap companies trade in flashy returns in the short run for a much more stable, safe, and long-term option. Shake Shack is a mid-cap company valued at just over $2 billion. These companies are usually expanding at rapid rates, as we see with this quarter’s report, but hold higher risk than a large-cap company.This is important to note because it provides a metric by which to evaluate the altering growth rates of Shake Shack and Chipotle. An investor may see a 7.4% increase in sales for Chipotle, compared to a 29% increase in Shake Shack, and make some sort of conclusion about its growth prospects. When we take into consideration the market capitalization and size of these companies, this statistic begins to make much more sense.Bottom LineShake Shack and Chipotle posted impressive Q1 earnings reports. Shake Shack’s growth outpaced that of Chipotle’s, but once Chipotle’s’ company size and previously negative customer sentiment are taken into account, we see that their numbers are more comparable.The numbers seem to suggest that the conservative investor should lean towards the large-cap Chipotle, which will provide more stability even through tough publicity and company problems. More aggressive investors will read the numbers as a sign to invest in Shake Shack, which is still a high growth stock that may provide an opportunity for quick profitability.Both companies are currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks, and whichever looks more attractive will depend on individual investment strategies.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

However, the figure decreased 18.2% from the prior-year quarter earnings of $1.59.

Despite witnessing soft sales in the last few quarters, the company believes that the IHOP brand remains on solid ground.Moreover, initiatives to improve guest satisfaction via online ordering as well as testing of delivery services and development of an IHOP mobile application are expected to create improved revenue channels.Applebee's domestic system-wide comps decreased 6.2% comparing favorably with the last quarter’s comps decline of 7.9% but unfavourably with the prior-year quarter’s decline of 4.2%. Notably, Applebee’s casual dining restaurants are facing stiff competition from fast-food and quick service restaurants. Also, consumers are favoring ordering in meals over going to brick-and-mortar retailers.Nonetheless, DineEquity believes that fiscal 2017 will be a transitional year for Applebee's, and steps taken to revitalize the brand via increased focus on food and culinary innovation, consumer satisfaction and marketing are expected to drive comps over the long term, with an improvement likely 2018 onwards.Fiscal 2017 Outlook SlashedFor fiscal 2017, Applebee's domestic system-wide comps are now expected to decrease in the range of 6–8% (a decline of 4% to 8%, expected earlier).IHOP's domestic system-wide comps are expected to be down in the range of 1% to 3% (earlier, flat to up 3%).DineEquity now expects general and administrative expenses to range between $166 million and $172 million ($170–$177 million, expected previously).Meanwhile, the company expects capital expenditure to be roughly $12 million in fiscal 2017, up from $12 million, anticipated earlier.Currently, DineEquity carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

3271,CMG,"Shares of The Wendy’s Company (WEN  -  Free Report) were up 3.9% in yesterday’s trading session after the company posted strong second-quarter 2017 results.Earnings and Revenue DiscussionAdjusted earnings came in at 15 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 13 cents by 15.4%. Moreover, the bottom line jumped 50% year over year on the back of the company’s system optimization initiatives and a lower share count.Total revenue of $320.3 million surpassed the consensus mark of $298.7 million by 7.2%. However, it decreased 16.3% year over year. The decline reflects a reduction in the number of company-operated restaurants as a result of its system optimization initiative. It owned 251 fewer company-operated restaurants in the second quarter compared with the year-ago quarter. The decline was partly offset by higher franchise royalty revenue and fees and franchise rental income.Wendy's Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Wendy's Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Wendy's Company (The) QuoteComps at North America system restaurants were up 3.2%, higher than an increase of 1.6% in the previous quarter, and 0.4% growth in the year-ago quarter.Profit DiscussionNorth America company-operated restaurant margin decreased 230 basis points (bps) to 19.6% primarily due to higher labor rates and increased commodity costs.General and administrative expenses decreased 16.1% year over year due to cost savings related to the company's system optimization initiative, lower professional fees and legal reserves as well as lower incentive compensation accruals.However, adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) increased 13.3% year over year despite the ownership of fewer company operated restaurants. The upside was driven by higher franchise fees as a result of the company’s Buy an Flip activity. Also, adjusted EBITDA margin improved 940 bps to 36.2%, owing to the positive impact of the company's system optimization initiative.Image ActivationImage Activation remains an integral part of the company’s global growth strategy, and includes reimaging existing restaurants and building new restaurants.At the end of the reported quarter, approximately 36% of the global system featured the brand’s new image. Meanwhile, Wendy’s and its franchisees continue to expect roughly 42% of the global system, image activated, by the end of 2017.Additionally, the company reiterated its full-year 2017 net new unit growth expectations of 1% in North America.

Operating margin contracted 320 bps for the Jack in the Box company restaurants due to elevated labor costs, higher repairs and maintenance costs, an increase in food and packaging costs and sales deleverage, somewhat offset by the benefit of refranchising activities in 2017.Also, at the Qdoba restaurants operating margin contracted 420 bps. The reduction was due to costs associated with new restaurant openings, an increase in food and packaging costs, impact of wage inflation and sales deleverage, partially offset by lower workers’ compensation costs.SG&A expenses for the fiscal third quarter, as a percentage of revenues, were 10.7%. The reported figure was down 90 bps from the prior-year quarter.

However, the bottom line declined 18.7% year over year, due to lower margins.Revenues of $315.8 million came above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $315 million by 0.3% and increased 3.3% year over year. This improvement was driven by higher restaurant revenues, somewhat offset by lower franchise royalties, fees and other revenues.Behind the Headline NumbersDuring the quarter, Red Robin’s restaurant revenues rose 3.4% year over year to nearly $312.4 million. The uptick was owing to new restaurant openings and higher comps, somewhat offset by loss of revenues from closed restaurants. Franchise royalties and fee revenues of $3.4 million were almost flat year over year.Company-owned restaurants comps inched up 0.5% year over year against the prior-quarter comps decline of 1.2%. The increase was led by a 1% rise in guest counts, partially offset by a 0.5% decline in average guest check. Notably, the decrease in average guest check comprised a 2.2% drop in menu mix, somewhat offset by a 1.7% increase in pricing.Despite lower occupancy costs, restaurant-level operating profit margin decreased 100 basis points (bps) to 19.9%, due to higher cost of sales, elevated labor costs and increase in other restaurant operating expenses.Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITDA) decreased 3.6% to $32.3 million from $33.5 million in the year-ago quarter.Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc.

This includes comparable restaurant revenue growth in the range of 0.5% to 1.5%. Additionally, the growth is expected to be driven by increased operating weeks associated with locations opened in 2016 and 2017, as well as the 53rd week in 2017.Cost of sales, as a percentage of restaurant revenue, is projected to be in the range of down 25 bps to up 25 bps in 2017 compared with 2016, given the impact of higher beef and potato prices in the second half of the year.Restaurant labor costs, as a percentage of restaurant revenue, are expected to be flat to up 50 bps year over year, due to minimum wage increases in more highly penetrated markets, elevated benefit costs and restaurant manager bonuses, to some extent offset by the effect of pricing and improvements in labor productivity.Adjusted EBITDA in 2017 is likely to be in between $145 million and $155 million.Capital expenditures are expected to be roughly between $85 million and $95 million.Meanwhile, the company plans to open roughly 17 and close nine Red Robin locations in 2017.Currently, Red Robin has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Peer ReleasesMcDonald's Corp.

Further, a lowered fiscal 2017 outlook due to prevailing challenging restaurant environment led to the slump in the stock price.Earnings and Revenue DiscussionAdjusted earnings of 78 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 76 cents by 2.6%. However, earnings remained flat on a year-over-basis.Sales of $569.9 million fell slightly short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $570.3 million but rose nearly 2% year over year. The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated QuoteInside the HeadlinesIn conjunction to the company’s previously announced guidance, comps at Cheesecake Factory restaurants declined 0.5%, whereas both the year-ago quarter and the preceding quarter marked 0.3% growth in comps. Menu price increase of 2.2% was more than offset by a 2.4% decline in traffic and negative mix of 0.3%.We note that in June, the company revealed that it expects comps decline of roughly 1% at Cheesecake Factory restaurants in second-quarter fiscal 2017, after previously projecting an increase in the band of 1% to 2%.The company witnessed heightened volatility in week to week sales trends in the quarter, indicative of uncertainty in the part of many customers. Particularly, weakness at its U.S. restaurants in the East and Midwest led to the soft sales. Unfavorable weather conditions in these regions also reduced patio usage -- a big draw for the chain. This, in turn, more than offset positive comps experienced in key markets of California, Texas and Florida.Cost of sales ratio decreased 10 basis points (bps) year over year to 22.6%. This was primarily attributable to the favorability across various categories. Meanwhile, labor expense ratio was 33.9%, 70 bps higher year over year owing to elevated hourly wage rates.General and administrative expenses accounted for 6.2% of revenues in the second quarter, 20 bps down from the prior-year quarter level. Notably, pre-opening expenses were roughly $1.3 million, down from $2.3 million in the year-ago quarter.Dividend HikeThe board of directors announced a 21% increase in the quarterly dividend from 24 cents to 29 cents per share, payable on Aug 29, 2017, to shareholders of record as of Aug 16, 2017. This adds up to an annual dividend of $1.16, representing a dividend yield of 2.5%. The dividend increase underscores the stability in the company’s cash flow generation.Third-Quarter Fiscal 2017 OutlookFor the fiscal third quarter, adjusted earnings per share are guided in the range of 60 cents to 64 cents based on an anticipated comps decline of 1% to 2% at Cheesecake Factory restaurants.Fiscal 2017 GuidanceThe company slashed its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share projection and now expects earnings in the range of $2.62 to $2.70, compared with $2.93 to $3.02 guided previously.

The downside can be attributed to dismal North America restaurants comparable sales and decline in North America commissary sales on weak volumes. The decrease was partially overshadowed by an increase in international sales and favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Also, a challenging sales environment in the U.S. restaurant space has been affecting the company for quite some time, which is evident from Papa John's top-line performance. Moreover, labor costs coupled with increased operating costs from digital initiatives and marketing expenses has put a substantial pressure on the company’s bottom line, which is expected to linger in 2018 as reflected in its outlook for the year.Global Restaurant Sales & CompsIn the first quarter, global restaurant sales decreased 1.3% compared unfavorably with the last reported quarter’s rise of 9.9% and the year-ago quarter’s growth of 4.9%.

3285,CMG,"With yields on the 10-year Treasury note reaching 3% for the first time in four years earlier this week, investors knew they would be fighting an uphill battle to extend the bull market through earnings season—despite the promise of strong profits and nearly double-digit revenue growth across the broader market.The primary challenge facing reporting companies is that this growth has, in large part, already been baked in to share prices. But if this week’s marquee earnings announcements are any indication, better-than-expected results and impressive guidance might be enough to restore optimism.Tech behemoths like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) crushed estimates, while semiconductor giants such as AMD (AMD  -  Free Report) and Intel  guided favorably and consumer brands—including Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report)—underscored the recent economic surge.Now, investors will look ahead to another busy week of earnings reports for even more bullishness.

3288,CMG,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings on Apr 25, after market close.Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.5%. Moreover, it surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 4.8%.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.53, which is lower than $1.60 in the year-ago quarter. Also, the consensus mark has witnessed a sharp downward revision of 64 cents over the past 90 days. However, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of nearly $1,148 million, up 7.4% from the prior-year quarter.Chipotle has been particularly plagued by negative publicity related to food-borne illnesses, which surfaced toward 2015-end and continued through 2016. Since then, the company has undertaken many safety measures and sales-building initiatives to revive its top line.Let’s take a look at how the company’s top and bottom lines will shape up in the to-be-reported quarter.Factors at PlayStrategic Initiatives to Drive SalesChipotle’s top line, which witnessed a sharp increase of 7.3% in fourth-quarter 2017, is likely to continue with the momentum in the quarter to be reported. The company’s strong marketing initiatives, ongoing improvements in customer experience, improved digital ordering channels and increased focus on menu innovation are the key growth drivers.Additionally, Chipotle is continuously trying to recover sales by shifting its strategy from giveaways, discounts and rewards to new menu items, operational excellence and enhancement of guest experience. Toward this end, the company rolled out queso nationally in the third quarter of 2017, following which it witnessed an immediate increase in sales. This uptick is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.In the fourth quarter, the company implemented a menu price increase at an additional 900 restaurants that should help boost the company’s top-line performance. In addition, management is designing a new beverage program for Chipotle, which includes a complete redesign of the beverages it serves and how they are merchandised to customers.Furthermore, Chipotle’s focus on developing new food safety protocols is impressive. These protocols include DNA-based testing of several ingredients coupled with changes to food preparation and food handling practices. The company’s enhanced focus on making better food accessible to everyone should also drive traffic in the first quarter.Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. QuoteHigher CostsChipotle is making efforts to connect with its customers in order to retrieve their trust and loyalty as well as bring them back to its stores. Although these initiatives are backed by high marketing and promo expenses, the same might hurt the company’s profitability. Moreover, implementation of food safety practices has increased the amount of labor required to prepare and serve food. This, in turn, raises labor costs, which could possibly weigh on the profit margin. In the first quarter, Chipotle expects other operating expenses to be nearly 15% of sales.What Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model shows that Chipotle is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP — for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Chipotle has an Eanings ESP of +0.79% and a Zacks Rank #3, which make us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Other Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are a few stocks from the restaurant space that investors may consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Domino's Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.38% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Brinker International, Inc.

3289,CMG,"Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG  -  Free Report) has suffered in the public eye and stock market after several food-related illnesses affected consumers. Of these, an E.coli outbreak in 2015 and norovirus outbreak in 2017, caught the eye of customers and had drastic financial consequences.A 30% loss in sales occurred following the initial outbreak, and the stock has fallen to less than half of its highest valuation since then. The company’s current earnings outlook does not look bright either. With 100% negative agreement among revising analysts, we have seen three adjustments to the company’s full-year EPS estimates within the past 60 days.Despite all of this, the stock seems to be pushing back today. Chipotle Mexican Grill shares rose $7.84, or 2.4%, since yesterday’s close at $326.60. Why is this the case? The root is managerial transitions.Following the incidents described above, the company restructured its leadership. In February, Chipotle announced that Steve Ells would step down as the company’s chief executive and be replaced by former Yum! Brands executive Brian Niccol. The stock rose 11% in after-hours trading that day.In March, shares rose 5% following the announcement that Chris Brandt, leader of marketing efforts at Taco Bell, would become Chipotle’s chief marketing officer in the following month. These two helped increase global sales by 7% at Taco Bell in 2017, proving their reputability.While these transitions may be the reason Chipotle stock has increased in the past month, the company’s stock market success today has more to do with a particular analyst note.After an evaluation by RBC Capital Markets, led by analyst David Palmer, the firm’s price target for Chipotle was from $310 to $340.This is a long term prediction by the investment bank, which thinks that the management transition, especially within the marketing sector, will have a profound impact on the future revenue and growth of the company.Chipotle is expected to witness EPS growth of 17.59% on an annualized basis over the next three to five year, which seems to support this idea. These factors have all contributed to Chipotle’s “C” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system and a rising Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), with the potential for much stronger growth under this new leadership.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

3290,CMG,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.’s (CMG  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings surpassed analysts’ expectations while revenues were in line with the same.Adjusted earnings of $2.13 topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.54 by 38.3%. Earnings also grew 33.1% from the year-ago quarter driven by higher revenues and lower food costs.Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Quote Chipotle had a good share of negative publicity throughout 2016 due to an issue of food-borne illnesses that surfaced toward 2015-end. As a safety measure, the company was forced to close several outlets. Ever since then, this fast-casual Mexican chain has been undertaking aggressive efforts to restore its economic model as well as regain customer trust.In order to chalk out a viable business strategy, Chipotle discarded its former co-CEO model and recently appointed former Yum! Brands' (YUM  -  Free Report) executive Brian Niccol as the CEO. Niccol’s expertise in restaurant operations, digital technologies and branding has significantly helped Chipotle in first-quarter earnings. Shares jumped 10.7% in after-hours trading on Apr 25. The company’s shares have also rallied 48.2% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 1.5%. Let’s have a detailed look at the quarter’s results.Revenues and Comparable Restaurant SalesQuarterly revenues of $1.15 billion met the consensus estimate but grew 7.4% year over year. The revenue growth is primarily attributable to improvement in comps and restaurant openings. The company opened 35 new restaurants in the first quarter and closed two restaurants, bringing the total restaurant count to 2,441.Comps in the quarter increased 2.2%, which include an underlying comp sales growth of 2.7% and 50 basis points (bps) impact related to deferred revenues, recognized during the year-ago quarter due to the Chiptopia Summer Rewards program. Comps were driven by an increase in average check, including 4.9% benefit from menu price increase, partially offset by fewer transactions and resistance that have been less than 20%. The check average also benefited from customers, adding queso to their orders, which added about 200 bps.Costs, Operating Highlights & Net IncomeFood costs, as a percentage of revenues, decreased 140 bps to 32.4% driven by cost savings in paper and packaging usage, as well as higher menu prices, partially offset by higher costs associated with preservative-free tortillas.General and administrative expenses came in at 6.7% of total revenues, reflecting an increase of 20 bps year over year, due to rise in headcount and higher bonus expenses. However, the increases were partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense as a result of forfeitures of stock during the quarter. Restaurant-level operating margin was 19.5%, up 180 bps from 17.7% in the year-ago quarter. The upside was primarily driven by lower marketing and promotional expenses, and comps growth, partially offset by wage inflation at the crew and manager level.Net income in the quarter was $59.4 million, up from $46.1 million in the prior-year quarter.Balance SheetCash and cash equivalents as of Mar 31, 2018 were $231.8 million, compared with $184.6 million as of Dec 31, 2017.Inventory totaled $17.4 million as of Mar 31, 2018, down from $19.9 million as of Dec 31, 2017. Goodwill, as a percentage of total assets, was 1.04% at the end of the first quarter compared with 1.07% at the end of 2017.During the first quarter, the company’s board of directors approved an investment of up to an additional $100 million, exclusive of commissions, to repurchase shares of the company’s common stock.2018 OutlookFor 2018, management continues to expect comps growth in low single digits and launch 130-150 restaurants.Effective tax rate is estimated in the range of 32.5-33.5% (up from the previously guided range of 30-31%), including an underlying effective tax rate of about 29% in the second and third quarters, and up to 38.5% high in the fourth quarter as a result of an additional anticipated write-off of deferred tax assets associated with stock-based compensation awards.Zacks Rank & Peer ReleasesChipotle carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3292,CMG,"Restaurant Brands International, Inc.’s (QSR  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The company’s top line in the quarter was favored by continued positive sales momentum at Burger King while the bottom line benefitted from strong growth in revenues and favorable tax rate.Changes in Accounting StandardsThe company announced that it has implemented two new accounting standards that impacted first-quarter results.From the beginning of 2018, Restaurant Brands adopted a new revenue recognition accounting standard, under which the company is complying the initial and renewal franchise fees and recognizing revenues over the term of the related franchise agreement instead of franchise fee, at the time of executing all material obligations and services.Additionally, Restaurant Brands also adopted a new guidance related to hedge accounting. Under this guidance, the company will not include amounts pertaining to cross-currency rate swaps in net interest expenses. In this way, management expects to spot a benefit in net interest expense.Earnings & Revenue DiscussionPer the new accounting standard, adjusted earnings of 66 cents in the first quarter surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents by 17.9%. Earnings under the previous accounting standard came in at 67 cents, which also grew 86.1% year over year.Total revenues of $1,253.8 million surpassed the consensus estimate of $1,126 million by 11.3%.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Restaurant Brands International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Restaurant Brands International Inc. QuoteDetailed Revenue Discussion by SegmentsRestaurant Brands operates through three segments — Tim Hortons, Burger King and Popeye’s Louisiana Kitchen.Tim Hortons reported revenues of $763.5 million, reflecting a rise of 4.1% from the prior-year quarter, primarily owing to greater franchise and property revenues. Under the previous standards of accounting, total revenues declined 3% year over year, primarily reflecting a decrease in supply chain-related revenues, partially offset by a favorable impact of FX movements.System-wide sales increased 2.1% on the back of net restaurant growth. Comps at this segment declined 0.3% in the quarter versus 0.1% decrease in the prior-year quarter and 0.1% increase in the preceding quarter. Comps were affected due to relatively flat Canada comparable sales.Burger King’s revenues were up 46% from the prior-year quarter to $389.9 million, mainly on the back of system-wide sales growth. Considering the previous accounting standard, total revenues in the quarter grew 9.7%.System-wide sales rose 11.3%, higher than 6.2% growth in the year-ago comparable period and 12.3% increase in the preceding quarter. System-wide sales growth can be attributed to net restaurant growth of 6.9% and positive comps growth.Comps grew 3.8% in the quarter under review versus 0.1% decline in the prior-year quarter and 4.6% increase in the preceding quarter. The upside was driven by U.S. comps growth of 4.2%.Popeye’s Louisiana Kitchen, which was acquired on Mar 27, 2017, reported revenues of $100.4 million in the quarter.System-wide sales rose 10.9%, owing to net restaurant growth of 6.7% and comps growth of 3.2%.

Segment wise, Tim Hortons EBITDA fell 2.2% (6.1% on an FX neutral basis) year over year due to a decline in revenues. Burger King’s EBITDA was up 14.9% (11.5% on an FX neutral basis) year over year, driven primarily by revenue growth and cost control. Popeye’s EBITDA grew 80.5% (on both actual and organic count) on revenue growth.Cash and Capital The company exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalent balance of $852.4 million under the new accounting standard. Accounts and notes receivable balance was $467.6 million and inventories were $74.6 million.

3293,CMG,"With Chipotle’s (CMG  -  Free Report) new CEO Brian Niccol at the helm, the first quarter could mark the start of a better era for the embattled fast casual chain. But before investors get too caught up in what Niccol might change long-term, they should look at what to expect from Chipotle’s upcoming first quarter financial results.Chipotle’s new chief executive, and the former head of Yum Brands’ (YUM  -  Free Report) Taco Bell didn’t officially take over until early March. This means that any business innovations Niccol might have already implemented won’t have much impact on Chipotle’s Q1 earnings results.Furthermore, amid this volatile market, investors should focus on finding stocks that are expected to post strong earnings results and avoid ones that aren’t.With that said, let’s take a look at what to expect from Chipotle as we inch closer to its first quarter earnings report.Outlook & ValuationChipotle’s Q1 revenues are projected to climb by 7.4% to reach $1.15 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Meanwhile, the restaurant chain is expected to report quarterly earnings of $1.53 per share, which would mark a 4.4% decline from the year-ago period.Investors should also note that Chipotle has earned four earnings estimate revisions, with 100% agreement to the downside, all within the last 60 days. However, the company’s Most Accurate Estimate is $1.55 per share. This means that estimates have come in higher as we get closer to Chipotle’s Q1 earnings.Chipotle is currently trading with a Forward P/E of 36.1, which marks a substantial premium to the “Retail – Restaurants” industry’s average of 22.4.Price Performance and Surprise HistoryAnother important factor that investors might want to consider ahead of Chipotle’s Q1 earnings report is the company’s history of earnings surprises and the effect that these surprises have had on share prices.Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. QuoteWe can see that Chipotle’s earnings surprise history has been up and down over the last few years, which is to be expected amid a rough time for the company. It is also worth noting that Chipotle’s stock price has been highly volatile immediately following the release of its quarterly earnings results. In fact, over the last six periods, Chipotle stock has sunk in the near-term four times.With that said, past performance does not necessarily indicate future success or failure, and we will have a better idea of where Chipotle stands closer to its report date, which is scheduled for April 25.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

3294,CMG,"Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG  -  Free Report) surged more than 1.2% in early morning trading Wednesday, making it one of the few glimmers of hope amid market-wide selling—inspired, in large part, by heightened concerns about a trade war between the U.S. and China.Trade war fears got very real on Wednesday after Chinese regulators announced additional tariffs on 106 U.S. products, or up to $50 billion worth of goods. The country’s new 25% levy on American imports will impact soybeans, cars, whiskey, and a number of other economic staples.China’s move comes less than a day after President Donald Trump released a list of Chinese imports that his administration plans to target as part of a proposed crackdown on what it deems to be unfair trade practices. Sectors impacted by Trump’s tariffs would include IT and communication technology, robotics, and aerospace.All 11 sectors of the S&P 500 were in negative territory early Wednesday morning following reports of these trade war maneuvers. However, companies like Chipotle—which famously sources its ingredients locally and is therefore less exposed to international tariffs—might stand to benefit as investors look to move away from heavily-trade-exposed segments of the economy.But is this embattled stock actually a smart pick right now? Let’s take a closer look.ValuationChipotle shares are currently trading at about 35.7x forward 12-month earnings. That might look cheap considering CMG has traded as high as 51.7x within the past year, but it is actually above the stock’s median 52-week Forward P/E of 35.1. What’s more, Chipotle is trading at a significant premium compared to the broader restaurant market:Chipotle might be less exposed to the potential trade war, but the stock is still more expensive than its peers—including companies like Brinker International (EAT  -  Free Report), Bloomin Brands (BLMN  -  Free Report), and Darden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report), which are also likely to be less affected by tariff issues. Investors scooping up CMG shares right now must seriously consider whether the stock warrants this premium.OutlookAnother thing to consider is that Chipotle’s analyst outlook has deteriorated substantially over the past few months. In fact, within the past 60 days, the company has witnessed 15 revisions to its current fiscal year earnings estimates, with 100% agreement to the downside. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Chipotle’s annual earnings has slipped $1.69 over that timeframe.Our proven Zacks Rank model places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, so this negative activity has earned CMG a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Possible UpsidesWhile Chipotle’s sluggish earnings outlook and questionable valuation present concerns, the stock does have some upside that might interest investors. First of all, it is still an interesting growth option as the company looks to recover from food safety concerns, and despite negative revisions, our consensus estimates are calling for Chipotle to witness EPS growth of 25% and revenue growth of 8% this fiscal year.Meanwhile, the company has undergone a significant transformation in terms of its management team recently, bringing on former Taco Bell chief Brian Niccol as its new CEO. Niccol has already shown signs that he will use his experience at the fast-food taco chain to his advantage, adding Chris Brandt, who led marketing efforts at Taco Bell for years, as the company’s new chief marketing officer.These positive trends might be enough to inspire some investors, especially considering that Chipotle is likely less exposed to the possible trade war that is dominating headlines.Want more market analysis from this author?

However, the company’s shares have lost more than 6% in after-hours trading on Apr 3, post the earnings release.Although earnings surpassed the consensus estimate, weak comps and dented margins might have hurt investors’ sentiments.Adjusted earnings of 61 cents surpassed the consensus estimate of 59 cents by 3.4%. Earnings, however, declined 3.2% year over year. Decrease in margin due to high operating costs might have led earnings to fall.

3296,CMG,"Dave & Buster’s Entertainment, Inc. (PLAY  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Apr 3, after market close.A unique business model with customizable guest experience across platforms gives the company a competitive edge. Dave & Buster’s also generates favorable store economics and strong returns as it offers a wide range of recreational options like games, live sports and other televised events alongside restaurant operations, as part of sales building. These are likely to reflect in the to-be-reported quarter’s sales.However, high costs associated with restaurant operations might have dented fourth-quarter earnings.Also, in a press release on Jan 8, 2018, the company revealed that it had a slower-than-expected start to the fourth quarter. Generally, restaurant sales witness an uplift in the month of December, but Dave & Buster’s trends in the month softened. This has led to management lowering the fiscal 2017 outlook.Notably, shares of the company have lost 31.1% over the last year, substantially underperforming 9.9% growth of the industry it belongs to.Let’s look at how the company’s fourth-quarter results will shape up.Distinct Business Style & Sales-Building Initiatives to Aid Top LineApart from food and beverages, Dave & Buster’s entertainment business has been driving growth. In fact, in the first nine months of fiscal 2017, amusement and other accounted for 55.6% of total revenues, and grew 17.1% year over year. This is because, increased dependence on gaming has cushioned the company from the headwinds, pressurizing the broader restaurant industry of late, and is in turn driving market share and comps. The upward trend in sales is likely to continue in the fourth quarter as well.Subsequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $304.6 million, mirroring 12.7% year-over-year growth.Meanwhile, menu innovation is another key attributor of the riveting growth potential of the restaurant. Dave & Buster’s also drives traffic by enhancing in-store and out-of-store customer experience, via digital and mobile strategic initiatives.Rising Costs Likely to Affect MarginsLike most other restaurant operators, Dave & Buster’s has been bearing the brunt of increased labor costs from Obamacare. Further, the company’s non-franchised model makes it susceptible to increased expenses. Since all the restaurants are owned and operated by Dave & Buster's, instead of signing franchise agreements and putting the burden of costs on the franchisee, the company is solely responsible for the expenses of operating the business.Moreover, pre-opening costs of outlets, given the company’s unit expansion plans and expenses related to sales initiatives are adding to the costs, and likely to hurt profits. Total operating costs in the first nine months of fiscal 2017 increased 13.1% and is expected to further rise in the to-be-reported quarter. This in turn is likely to affect margins and earnings.Subsequently, the consensus estimate for earnings in the fourth quarter is pegged at 61 cents, reflecting a 3.2% year-over-year decline.Our Quantitative Model Does Not Predict a BeatDave & Buster’s does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.38%.

3297,CMG,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report) had a good share of negative publicity throughout 2016 due to an issue of food-borne illnesses that surfaced toward 2015-end. As a safety measure, the company was forced to close several outlets. Ever since then, this fast-casual Mexican chain has been undertaking aggressive efforts to restore its economic model as well as regain customer trust.However, high costs associated with restaurant operations and stiff competition in the fast-casual restaurant space continue to remain potent headwinds.Notably, shares of the company have lost 25.6% in the past year, widely underperforming its industry’s growth of 10.2%. Will the Appointment of New CEO Bring Any Change?In order to chalk out a viable business strategy, Chipotle discarded its former co-CEO model and appointed Steve Ells as the company’s sole CEO in 2016. However, the company did not refrain from enhancing its board. Toward this end, Chipotle recently appointed former Yum! Brands' (YUM  -  Free Report) executive Brian Niccol to replace Ells. Chipotle aims to make use of Brian Niccol's expertise in restaurant operations, digital technologies, and branding to augment guest experience.Although the appointment of the new CEO might help in Chipotle’s turnaround, it is yet to be seen if he can bring about remarkable positive changes for the company. This is because strategies followed at a quick-service restaurant like Taco Bell are not likely to work for Chipotle, which is more of a healthier fast-casual option.High Costs and Stiff Competition Remain ConcernsChipotle’s continued efforts to connect with its customers in order to retrieve their trust and loyalty, as well as bring them back to its stores on the back of high marketing and promo expenses have been hurting its profitability. Moreover, the company is incurring additional costs to support its newly designed food safety program. In addition to wages, Chipotle is also facing high labor costs from training its workers to aptly implement food safety practices.Also, competition from fast-casual, quick-service and casual dining restaurateurs like BJ’s Restaurants (BJRI  -  Free Report) and El Pollo Loco (LOCO  -  Free Report) is expected to remain fierce with respect to price, food quality, service, location and concept, which may adversely impact Chipotle’s operating margins and profits.Sales Building Efforts a RespiteChipotle’s strong marketing initiatives, ongoing improvements in customer experience, improved digital ordering channels, along with increased focus on menu innovation are the key growth drivers. Owing to these efforts, Chipotle somewhat managed to witness 7.3% year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2017. By focusing extensively on digital innovation, the company hit new records as its digital sales mix was 8.6% of sales in the last reported quarter.Furthermore, adoption of new food safety protocols is expected to reap results in the long term. In March 2017, Chipotle fulfilled its pledge to use no added colors, flavors or preservatives of any kind in any of its ingredients. In fact, the company now makes use of only 51 real ingredients to prepare all of its food, in stark contrast to most other fast food chains.Chipotle’s enhanced focus on making better food accessible to everyone should thus aid in driving traffic and sales.Zacks Rank Chipotle carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

3299,CMG,"Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG  -  Free Report) surged more than 5% in early morning trading Wednesday, adding to the fast-casual chain’s prior-day momentum that was inspired by another key addition to the company’s management team.Just a few weeks after hiring former Taco Bell chief Brian Niccol as its new CEO, Chipotle is bringing another executive from the Mexican-themed fast-food company on board. Chris Brandt, who led marketing efforts at Taco Bell for years, will take over as Chipotle’s chief marketing officer next month.The move underscores what many investors thought would be the case after Niccol’s hire: faced with a tarnished brand reputation, Chipotle would take inspiration from Taco Bell, a restaurant that has very little in common with the fast-casual company outside of their chosen regional cuisines.Taco Bell has earned a reputation for zany dishes, out-of-the-box advertising, and low-budget food. Meanwhile, Chipotle prides itself on high-quality, locally-sourced ingredients and sustainable operating policies.But for Niccol and Brandt, the task of repairing Chipotle’s reputation after multiple food-safety scandals is one that demands diverse experiences.“Having worked with Chris in the past, I have seen first-hand his ability to generate sales overnight and build brands over time, Niccol said in a statement. “[His experience fits in] as we look to reinvigorate this exceptional brand, and build sales, transactions and profitability.”Customers around the U.S. have lost their faith in Chipotle in the wake of several foodborne-illness outbreaks linked to its restaurants, dating all the way back to 2015. Since then, the company’s stock has tumbled significantly, falling more than 50% from its all-time highs.Chipotle was able to turn things around a bit in 2017, with full-year revenues improving by nearly 15% on the back of 6.4% comps growth. However, those year-over-year comparisons were made easier by the company’s dismal 2016 results, and investors did not reward the company for its efforts.Analyst sentiment for CMG remains poor. Within the past 60 days, we have witnessed 16 revisions for Chipotle’s 2018 EPS estimates, with 100% agreement to the downside. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has slipped a total of $1.47 in that time.This sluggish earnings outlook has earned the stock a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Nevertheless, CMG sports a “B” grade for Growth as year-over-year figures should continue to improve.Want more market analysis from this author?

3300,CMG,"El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc. (LOCO  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter of 2017.Pro-forma earnings of 11 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 10 cents by 10%. Earnings, however, fell 8.3% from the year-ago level, partly due to high expenses related to the impairment of assets.Total revenues increased 2.9% year over year to $95.2 million and surpassed the consensus estimate of $95 million. The revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase in company-operated restaurants sales.The company’s aggressive sales building efforts like relentless focus on providing excellent service, reasonable pricing and advertising campaigns have favored the top-line growth. However, high costs related to the execution of various sales-building initiatives have kept profits under pressure.El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc.

However, five restaurants were closed down during the same time period that somewhat affected the company-operated restaurant revenues.Comps at the company-operated restaurants increased 0.9% in the quarter, driven by 1.9% growth in average check, partially offset by 1% decline in transactions.Fourth-quarter franchise revenues decreased 1.5% year over year to $5.9 million due to a fall in franchise and development agreement fees but was partially offset by the contribution from 14 new restaurants opened during and subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2016. A 1.9% increase in franchise comps also positively affected franchise revenues.System-wide comps increased 1.4% from the prior-year quarter.Expenses, Adjusted EBITDA and Net IncomeTotal expenses in the fourth quarter amounted to $104.9 million, up 15.8% from the year-ago quarter. The rise in expenses was largely due to 23% increase in general and administrative expenses.Also, during the quarter, the company recorded a $16.4 million expense related to the impairment of the assets of 11 restaurants in Texas and one in Arizona, net of closed-store reserve.Adjusted EBITDA (Expense Before Interest Tax Depreciation Amortization) in the quarter came in at $13.4 million, a 6.3% year-over-year decline.Net loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $38 thousand against net income of $0.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.Balance SheetCash and cash equivalents as of Dec 27, 2017 totaled $8.6 million, up from $2.2 million as of Dec 28, 2016.

3301,CMG,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 17.5% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is CMG due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Recent EarningsChipotle Mexican reported mixed fourth-quarter 2017 results, with earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues lagging the same.Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter were $1.34, surpassing the consensus estimate of $1.32 by 1.5%. Including the 21-cent positive impact from the U.S. tax law, earnings came in at $1.55. Earnings also grew 143.6% year over year on lower costs and higher revenues.Chipotle has been bearing the brunt of a challenging restaurant operating environment and has been particularly plagued by negative publicity related to food-borne illnesses, which had surfaced toward 2015-end. In order to regain reputation and drive sales, the company has been trying to streamline operations and enhance guest experience.Toward this end, Chipotle is focusing on digital innovation. In fact, in the fourth quarter, the company hit new records as its digital sales mix was 8.6% of sales while two of the company’s regions have digital sales of more than 10% of their overall mix. Chipotle is also reinvesting in existing restaurants and trying to improve their appearances and functions.Revenues and Comparable Restaurant SalesQuarterly revenues of $1.11 billion lagged the consensus estimate of $1.12 billion by 0.9% but grew 7.3% year over year. The revenue growth is primarily attributable to restaurant openings. The company opened 38 new restaurants in the fourth quarter and relocated an additional four restaurants, reaching the total restaurant count to 2,408.The rise in comps somewhat partially favored revenues. Comps in the quarter increased 0.9% which includes a 0.6% reduction related to deferred revenues recognized during the year-ago quarter due to the Chiptopia Summer Rewards program. Comps were driven by an increase in average check, including a 2.4% impact from menu price increase in select restaurants during the second and fourth quarter of 2017, partially offset by a decline in transactions.Costs, Operating Highlights & Net IncomeFood costs, as a percentage of revenues, decreased 110 basis points (bps) to 34.2% driven by cost savings in paper and packaging usage as well as higher menu prices. Favorable avocado prices during the quarter, when compared with the prior-year quarter, also led to cost reduction.General and administrative expenses comprised 5.2% of total revenues, reflecting a decrease of 110 bps year over year. This can be attributed to lower legal costs and non-cash stock-based compensation expenses.Restaurant level operating margin was 14.9%, up 140 bps from 13.5% in the year-ago quarter. The upside was primarily driven by reduced food, beverage and packaging expenses and lowered promotional activities.Net income in the quarter was $43.8 million, up from $16.0 million in the prior-year quarter, courtesy of $6.0 million gain from changes in the U.S. tax law.Balance SheetCash and cash equivalents as of Dec 31, 2017, were $184.6 million compared with $87.9 million as of Dec 31, 2016.Inventory totaled $19.9 million as of Dec 31, 2017, up from $15 million as of Dec 31, 2016. Goodwill, as a percentage of total assets, was 1.07% at the end of 2017 compared with 1.08% in the prior year.Total shareholder’s equity was $1.36 billion as of Dec 31, 2017, compared with $1.40 billion as of Dec 31, 2016.2017 HighlightsRevenues in 2017 increased 14.7% to $4.5 billion, with comps growing 6.4%. Diluted earnings per share were $6.17, including a benefit of 21 cents per share resulting from changes in U.S. tax law, compared with 77 cents in 2016.Restaurant level operating margin was 16.9%, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 410 bps. Net income in 2017 was $176.3 million, showing an improvement from $22.9 million last year.The company opened 183 new restaurants in the year and relocated 25 more, including 15 ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen Restaurants.2018 OutlookFor 2018, management expects comps increase of low single digits and expects to launch130-150 restaurants. Effective tax rate is estimated in the range of 30% to 31%, which includes an underlying effective tax rate of about 27% to 28% and the effect of prior year employee equity plans.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been five revisions lower for the current quarter.Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price and Consensus  Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price and Consensus | Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.

3302,CMG,"El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc. (LOCO  -  Free Report) has recently expanded its delivery partnership with privately held restaurant delivery service, DoorDash.In September 2017, the partnership began with the duo launching a pilot program in El Pollo Loco’s 98 restaurants in Nevada, Las Vegas and Orange County, CA. Following the expansion, delivery is now available from over 280 of El Pollo Loco’s restaurants, which is more than half of the total number of restaurants operated by the company.Notably, the new participating markets include Los Angeles, Houston, Phoenix, Dallas, Ariziona, San Francisco, San Jose, San Diego and Sacramento. While ordering is available at El Pollo Loco’s website and app, DoorDash will take care of delivery only.We observe that El Pollo Loco shares have lost 18.2% in a year’s time against the industry’s 11.9% gain.Delayed Entry Into DeliveryThough relatively late, El Pollo Loco’s entry in to delivery makes sense. This is because delivery is considered to be the fastest growing channel in the business and an effective way of addressing changing needs of customers.Moreover, the move should help the company better compete with the likes of Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG  -  Free Report), YUM! Brands’ (YUM  -  Free Report) Taco Bell and Rubio’s Coastal Grill that offer delivery directly through apps like DoorDash and Postmates.El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc. Net Income (TTM) El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc. Net Income (TTM) | El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc. QuoteTargeting MillennialsWith millennials getting more concerned about convenience and seeking speedier options, enhancing delivery has become crucial for quick-service industry players.Per market research firm The NPD Group, delivery currently represents 1.7 billion foodservice visits annually and young adults represent 56% of foodservice delivery orders.We believe that with increased focus on delivery, El Pollo Loco will be in a better position to capture a bigger share of millennial traffic.Zacks Rank & Key PicksEl Pollo Loco carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3303,CMG,"Papa John’s International, Inc.

The bottom line also fell 6% from the year-ago quarter due to weak operating results.Revenues of $467.6 million surpassed the consensus estimate of $461.9 million by 1.2% and increased 6.4% year over year. The upside was driven by higher International sales owing to 2.6% growth in comps and higher North America commissary sales on increased commodity prices. Foreign currency also favorably impacted the quarter’s revenues.Papa John's International, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Papa John's International, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Papa John's International, Inc. QuoteHowever, when adjusted for one extra week in 2017, revenues for the fourth quarter decreased 0.7%, primarily on lower company-owned restaurant sales. A challenging sales environment in the U.S. restaurant space has been affecting the company for quite some time and reflected in the top-line results. Also, labor costs coupled with increased operating costs from digital initiatives and marketing expenses have put substantial pressure on the company’s bottom line, which is expected to linger in 2018, as reflected in the company’s 2018 outlook.Given management’s weak EPS guidance for 2018, shares of Papa John’s fell 7.6% in after-hours trading on Feb 27.

3304,CMG,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report) announced its plan to reduce its waste stream to landfills by 50%. Since 2015, the company is taking noteworthy steps to reduce the amount of food and packaging waste to be disposed in landfills and has increased its diversion rate from 31% in 2015 to 40% in 2017.Landfills emit greenhouse gases that are hazardous for the environment. By diverting waste materials and limiting them for landfills, the company is trying to contribute to the environment and posit a distinct value to its customers.To reach this goal, Chipotle is implementing practices like minimal food waste disposal during the preparation process, recycling as well as compost programs for food packages, use of reusable lids replacing plastic wraps and participation in the Harvest Program to donate leftover food to local communities. The company is also increasing composting convenience in its restaurants to 20% by 2020.The move underscores Chipotle’s undying keenness in restoring the company’s economic model by regaining customer trust that was widely affected throughout 2016, due to an issue of food-borne illness.Notably, shares of Chipotle have lost 30.2% in the past year, underperforming its industry’s gain of 10.9%.Attracting Customers to Aid SalesChipotle has been looking for ways to recover its lost traffic. To this end, the company has been undertaking aggressive efforts to enhance customer experience. Waste reduction and diversification would only add to the company’s initiatives to regain faith and build a better environment for its guests. Through environment friendly measures, the company can attract more guests that would eventually build up sales.Alongside this environment friendly commitment, the company has adopted new food safety protocols. In March 2017, Chipotle fulfilled its pledge to use no added colors, flavors or preservatives of any kind in any of its ingredients. In fact, the company now makes use of only 51 real ingredients to prepare all of its food, in stark contrast to most other fast food chains.Chipotle’s enhanced focus on making food accessible to everyone and the environment-friendly efforts should thus aid in driving traffic and sales.Our TakeChipotle’s food integrity mission is not just about ingredients but also concerning the broader environment.However, the company’s continued efforts to connect with its customers, and retrieve their trust and loyalty involve increased costs. The company is already incurring additional costs to support its newly designed food safety program. In addition to wages, Chipotle is also facing high labor costs from training its workers to aptly implementing food safety practices.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderChipotle carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the restaurant space include Dine Brands (DIN  -  Free Report), Arcos Dorados Holdings (ARCO  -  Free Report) and Ruth's Hospitality Group (RUTH  -  Free Report), each flaunting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

(DIN  -  Free Report), formerly known as DineEquity, Inc., reported better-than-expected results in fourth-quarter 2017.Management announced that it changed the company’s name effective Feb 20, as part of its transformation process. However, the ticker symbol remains unchanged.Adjusted earnings of 74 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 64 cents by 15.6%. However, the bottom line declined 46% from the prior-year quarter. Decline in the company’s gross profit has affected earnings but was partially offset by fewer weighted average diluted shares outstanding.Total revenues in the quarter came in at $148.8 million, a decline of 3.5% year over year. However, revenues marginally surpassed the consensus estimate of $148 million. Revenues were affected by closing down of a few restaurants and non-collectible franchise royalties from Applebee.DineEquity, Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  DineEquity, Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | DineEquity, Inc Quote Shares moved 0.5% in after-hours trading following the earnings release on Feb 20. Meanwhile, Dine Brands’ shares have gained 56.6% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 1.8%.The company’s brand revitalization strategies reflect slightly in the fourth-quarter comps performance. The company expects these strategies to pay off in the first quarter of 2018. However, Applebee’s bad debt expense has put pressure on gross profit, which in turn has dented the bottom line.Let’s delve deeper into the numbers.Brand Performances by CompsApplebee's domestic system-wide comps increased 1.3%. This compares favorably with the third quarter’s decrease of 3.2% and the prior-year quarter’s decline of 7.2%.IHOP’s domestic system-wide comps were down 0.4%, comparing favorably with the last quarter’s decline of 7.7% and the prior-year quarter’s fall of 2.1%.Cost, Gross Profit & Net Income Total cost of revenues in the quarter increased 13.2% year over year to $71.6 million. Subsequently, gross profit in the quarter came in at $77.2 million, down 15.1% from the year-ago quarter.General and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter increased 8.1% year over year to $40 million.

Long-term debt at the end of 2017 totaled $1.27 billion, down from $1.28 billion at the end of 2016.

The dividend will be payable on Apr 6, 2018, to stockholders of record at the close of business on Mar 19, 2018.2017 HighlightsAdjusted earnings in the year came in at $4.15 per share, a decline of 30.9% year over year. The deterioration in adjusted net income was mainly due to lower gross profit and an increase in general and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were $165.7 million in 2017 compared with $148.9 million in 2016. Applebee's domestic system-wide comps declined 5.3% in 2017, whereas IHOP's domestic system-wide comps fell 1.9%.2018 GuidanceBoth Applebee and IHOP's domestic system-wide comps are expected in the range of flat to up 3%. Applebee's franchisees are expected to open 10 to15 restaurants globally, while that of IHOP's might open 85 to 100.The company expects adjusted EPS in the range of $4.95-$5.25.General and administrative expenses are expected between $147 million and $156 million.Zacks Rank & Peer ReleasesDineEquity carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

3307,CMG,"Shares of several restaurant chains—including Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG  -  Free Report), Shake Shack (SHAK  -  Free Report), and Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report)—surged on Monday as investors began to dive into companies and industries that stand to benefit from a potential GOP tax plan.Both the Senate and House versions of the GOP tax plan call for the corporate tax rate to be cut from 35% to 20%. This massive reduction could lead to greater profits at almost every U.S. company.The U.S. Senate passed a tax bill over the weekend, helping Republicans inch closer to sending a bill to President Donald Trump’s desk—one he hopes to sign before Christmas.Now, after the Senate’s 51-49 vote across party lines—with just one Republican voting against it—the GOP’s plan to cut roughly $1.4 trillion in taxes has once again spurred market movement.Last week, Chipotle stock popped after the fast-casual burrito chain announced it would begin a search for a new CEO. On Monday, shares of Chipotle climbed over 5.5% as investors began to take into account how a new U.S. tax code could help bolster the Colorado-based chain’s bottom line.Investors jumped on Chipotle stock after the weekend Senate vote because the company currently pays one of the highest effective tax rates, according to a Credit Suisse report. This has many Chipotle investors cautiously optimistic about the possibility that a GOP tax overhaul could help raise the struggling company’s profits.Smaller companies with a lot of U.S. sales tend to pay higher effective tax rates than much bigger multinational firms.Investors began to buy shares of companies throughout the U.S. restaurant industry with the hopes that a Republican tax plan—if passed—could help boost profits. On top of that, a decreased tax burden could lead to further investments and strategic business initiatives amid the quickly shifting food industry landscape.Shares of domestic burger chain Shake Shack Inc. climbed over 2.55% to hit a new 52-week high. Yum! Brands, which owns KFC, Taco Bell, and others, also saw its stock price touch a new high on Monday.The Wendy's Company (WEN  -  Free Report) shares surged 3.78%, while shares of Domino's Pizza (DPZ  -  Free Report) and Jack in the Box Inc. (JACK  -  Free Report) both jumped by around 1.75%.Shares of U.S. coffee powerhouse Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. (DNKN  -  Free Report) also rose more than 3% to hit a new 52-week high. Fellow domestic and international coffee giant, Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report), saw its stock price climb over 3%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

3308,CMG,"Jack in the Box Inc. (JACK  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, with earnings and revenues missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Consequently, the company’s shares lost more than 5% in after-hours trading on Nov 29 owing to disappointing comparable-store sales (comps) at the Qdoba brand.Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC continues to assist the board in its assessment of possible alternatives with respect to the Qdoba brand coupled with other ways to boost shareholders’ value.Notably, there is no assurance that the evaluation process will result in any transaction and the company has also not set a timeline for conclusion of the evaluation process.Earnings and Revenue DiscussionAdjusted earnings per share of 73 cents lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 89 cents by 18%. Further, the bottom line declined 24.3% year over year primarily due to lower revenues and restaurant operating margins.Revenues of $338.7 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $342.5 million by 1.1%. Moreover, the top line fell 15% on a year-over-year basis owing to lower Jack in the Box and Qdoba brand sales. Jack In The Box Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Jack In The Box Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Jack In The Box Inc. Quote Behind the Headline NumbersComps at Jack in the Box company stores declined 2%, comparing unfavorably with the prior-year quarter fall of 0.5% and last quarter’s decline of 1.6%. Notably, a 5.4% decrease in transactions was partially offset by an average check growth of 3.4%.Same-store sales at franchised stores declined 0.7%, comparing unfavorably with the gain of 2.4% in the year-ago quarter and the gain of 0.1% in the previous quarter. System same-store sales fell 1% against rise of 2% in the comparable period last year and prior-quarter comps decline of 0.2%.Comps at company-owned Qdoba restaurants were down 4%, reflecting 6.4% decrease in transactions, partially offset by growth in average check and catering sales. This decline compared unfavorably with the prior-quarter decrease of 1.1% and the prior-year quarter rise of 1.2%.Comps at franchised restaurants remained flat during the quarter, comparing unfavorably with the increase of 2.3% in the prior quarter and the year-ago comps growth of 0.4%. Also, system same-store sales were down 2.1% against a respective gain of 0.8% and 0.5% in the year-ago quarter and the last quarter.The company’s consolidated restaurant operating margin was 15.8% of total sales, down 390 basis points (bps) year over year. Operating margin contracted 180 bps for the Jack in the Box company restaurants due to sales deleverage, elevated labor costs and higher repairs and maintenance costs, partially offset by a decrease in food and packaging costs and the benefit of refranchising activities in 2017.Also, at the Qdoba restaurants, operating margin contracted 610 bps due to costs associated with new restaurant openings, an increase in food and packaging costs, impact of wage inflation and sales deleverage as well as commodity inflation.SG&A expenses in the fiscal fourth quarter, as a percentage of revenues, were 10.6%. The figure was down 150 bps from the prior-year quarter. This reflects the impact of the company's restructuring activities, a $2.1-million decline in pension and postretirement benefits, reduced insurance costs as well as lower incentive compensation.Fiscal 2017 HighlightsFor fiscal 2017, the company posted operating earnings per share of $3.88 compared with $3.86 last year.Total revenues were $1.55 billion as compared with $1.6 billion in fiscal 2016.During fiscal 2017, the company repurchased approximately 3,220,000 shares at an average price of $101.59 for an aggregate cost of $327.2 million.The company has decided to issue a fiscal 2018 guidance post the completion of the Qdoba evaluation process.Currently, Jack in the Box has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3309,CMG,"Three prominent U.S. restaurant chains made big announcements over the last two days, helping the food industry jump to the front of many investors’ minds.Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report) announced its search for a new CEO on Wednesday, and news broke on Tuesday that Arby's Restaurant Group is set to acquire Buffalo Wild Wings .Shares of Chipotle climbed after Steve Ells, the chairman, CEO, and founder of the company, announced that he intends to step down from his role as chief executive. Chipotle is now on the lookout for a new CEO to lead the struggling fast-casual burrito chain after a rough two-year stretch (also read: Why Did Chipotle Mexican Grill Stock Jump Today?).Similarly, the Arby’s and Buffalo Wild Wings deal comes at a time when the chicken wing giant has slumped due to a multitude of factors (also read: Why Buffalo Wild Wings Stock Soared Today).These two significant moves coincide with shifting U.S. eating habits that have left the restaurant industry somewhat in flux, leaving chains to fight among themselves to try to keep pace and standout. However, while individual chains and restaurants struggle, food wholesalers are still in demand.With that said, let’s take a look at three food industry stocks that present diversified exposure to the restaurant world at a time when picking individual restaurant stocks can prove challenging.Performance Food Group Company (PFGC  -  Free Report)This food wholesale powerhouse, which delivers food to restaurants, vendors, and more, is the parent company of Vistar, PFG Customized, and Performance Foodservice. Performance Food Group is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and boasts an overall “A” VGM score.PFG also scored a “B” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. The company’s full-year sales are expected to surge over 7% to hit $17.95 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. On top of that, PFG’s EPS is expected to jump 20.69% this quarter and 16.94% for the full year.Along with its top and bottom line growth projections, PFG’s current cash flow growth of 9.01% blows away the “Food – Natural Foods Products” industry’s 1.17% average and helps demonstrate the company’s growing cash position.What’s more, the food distributor is currently trading at 20.21x earnings, which marks a discount compared its industry’s average and looks decent compared to the S&P 500’s average. PFG’s “B” Value grade is further supported by its 0.18 price to sales ratio, which also beats its industry’s average.Shares of PFG gained over 1.30% on Wednesday to hit a new 52-week high. This is part of a year-long run that has seen its stock price climb nearly 32%.Pilgrim's Pride Corporation (PPC  -  Free Report)Shares of this chicken giant, which sells to grocery stores and delis, as well as local and national restaurant chains, popped on Wednesday to hit a new 52-week intraday trading high. Shares of Pilgrim's Pride have soared over 88.36% since the start of the year.Earlier this month, Pilgrim's Pride posted third-quarter revenues of $2.79 billion, which marked a 12% year-over-year jump. On top of that, the company’s EPS skyrocketed 138%.For its upcoming fourth-quarter, Pilgrim's Pride sales are expected to jump nearly 33% to hit $2.57 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. For the full-year, the company’s revenues are projected to hit $9.48 billion, which would mark a 19.55% gain from last year.Also in Q4, Pilgrim's Pride earnings are expected to skyrocket 94.44%, while full-year EPS growth is projected to hit 62.71%.What’s more, Pilgrim's Pride boasts an “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system. This is supported by the company’s current 0.99 P/S ratio, which marks a discount compared to some of its competitors such as Hormel (HRL  -  Free Report) and Sanderson Farms (SAFM  -  Free Report). Pilgrim's Pride is also currently trading at 12.56x earnings, which fairs well against the S&P 500 and marks a discount compared to its industry’s average.Pilgrim's Pride is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports an overall VGM Grade of an “A.”Farmer Bros. Co. (FARM  -  Free Report)This wholesale coffee company, which sells coffee to hotels, restaurants, and fast food chains, is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Based on our consensus estimates, Farmer Bros’ earnings are projected to climb 50% next quarter, while its revenues are projected to gain 19.45% to hit $166.1 million. For the full-year, the company’s earnings are expected to hit $0.72 per share, which would mark a 2.89% gain. On top of that, Farmer Bros’ full-year sales are projected to surge 16.11% to reach as high as $628.7 million.Furthermore, Farmer Bros scored a “B” for Value in our Style Scores system. The company’s 1.05 P/S ratio is strong, while Farmer Bros current price to book ratio of 2.63 is very respectable.Shares of Farmer Bros have gained 2.42% over the last 12-weeks and surged over 1.60% on Wednesday. Lastly, the coffee wholesaler has topped our Zacks Consensus Estimates for earnings in each of the last two quarters by a wide margin.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

3310,CMG,"Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG  -  Free Report) rose on Wednesday morning following the announcement that it will begin to search for a new CEO in order to help turn the struggling restaurant chain around.Steve Ells, the chairman, CEO, and founder of Chipotle, announced today that he intends to step down from his role as chief executive once a new CEO is appointed. Ells’ move comes after a string of food-related incidents, including an E. coli outbreak and norovirus stomach bugs, caused multiple Chipotle customers to get sick.An E. coli outbreak in 2015 forced Chipotle to close multiple locations and helped sparked the company’s now more than a two-year downturn. Shares of the fast casual burrito chain were sitting at their all-time high of over $740 per share in the summer of 2015. The first reports of an E. coli outbreak at Chipotle began in October 2015. Today, Chipotle shares sit at $296.Ells will stay on as executive chairman after the committee formed by the board of directors finds a new chief executive. Chipotle’s team hopes to replace Ells with someone that has “demonstrated turnaround expertise to help address the challenges facing the company, improve execution, build customer trust, and drive sales,” according to a company statement.Investors have greeted Ells’ decision to walk away as CEO of the company he started in 1993 very favorably so far, as shares of Chipotle climbed over 4.70% following the announcement.“Simply put, we need to execute better to ensure our future success,” Ells said in a statement.  “Bringing in a new CEO is the right thing to do for all our stakeholders... Chipotle has vast unrealized potential. As we work hard to restore our brand, I believe we can capitalize on opportunities, including in areas such as the digital experience, menu innovation, delivery, catering, and domestic and international expansion, to deliver significant growth.”Ells reportedly made the decision to step down on his own, and Chipotle’s board agreed. “It will allow me to focus on my strengths, which include bringing innovation to the way we source and prepare our food,” Ells continued.The company currently boasts more than 2,350 restaurants. Since the start of the year, shares of Chipotle have sunk over 24%, including a 7.28% decline in the last 12-weeks.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

3317,CMG,"Jack in the Box Inc. (JACK  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected results in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.Adjusted earnings of $1.23 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06 by 16%. The bottom line also increased nearly 15% year over year on margin improvement driven by refranchising.Revenues of $294.5 million exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $285.9 million by 3%. However, the top line fell 16.6% on a year-over-year basis owing to lower comps.Jack In The Box Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Jack In The Box Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Jack In The Box Inc. Quote Following its earnings release on Feb 21, shares of the company rose 2.2% in after-hours trading. However, Jack in the Box lost 10% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s growth of 10.5%.Notably, the company’s refranchising strategies are effectively improving margins despite pressure from higher labor and maintenance costs and commodity inflation.Jack in the Box Comps DiscussionComps at Jack in the Box company stores increased 0.2%, comparing unfavorably with the prior-year quarter’s rise of 0.6%, but better than last quarter’s decline of 2%. The comps growth was driven by average check growth of 2.6%, partially offset by a 2.4% decline in transactions.Same-store sales at franchised stores declined 0.3%, comparing unfavorably with a gain of 3.9% in the year-ago quarter, but improved from a loss of 0.7% in the previous quarter. System-wide same-store sales fell 0.2% against a rise of 3.1% in the comparable period last year and the prior-quarter’s comps decline of 1%.Qdoba ScenarioIn the fiscal first quarter, the company signed an agreement to sell Qdoba to Apollo Global Management, LLC. The transaction, however, is expected to close by April 2018. Therefore, the company did not allocate any general and administrative shared services expenses to discontinued operations that incorporate Qdoba’s operating results.Qdoba generated net loss of $0.6 million in the quarter against net earnings of $1.4 million in the prior-year quarter.Operating HighlightsThe company’s consolidated restaurant operating margin was 22.2%, up 60 basis points (bps) year over year.Restaurant-level EBITDA increased 20 bps from the year-ago quarter to 26%. The increase was driven by the benefit of refranchising, but was partially offset by an increase in food and packaging costs resulting from commodity inflation, higher repairs and maintenance costs, wage inflation and higher costs for workers' compensation insurance.Franchise operating margin was 52.6%, down 30 bps year over year. Franchise EBITDA was 60.9% in the quarter, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 10 bps. The downside was due to reduced royalties from some restaurants sold to franchisees in 2017, and a decrease in franchise-operated restaurant comps in the current quarter. This was, however, partially offset by an uptick in franchise fees of $0.8 million from the refranchising of 22 restaurants in the first quarter.Balance SheetAs of Jan 21, 2018, Cash totaled $3.8 million compared with $4.5 million as of Oct 1, 2017 (end of fourth-quarter and fiscal 2017). Inventories in the first quarter amounted to $3.3 million, down from $3.4 million at the end of fiscal 2017.Long-term debt was $1.03 billion as of Jan 21, 2018 compared with $1.07 billion at the end of fiscal 2017. Cash flows from operating activities declined to $53.7 million in the first quarter, compared with $69.8 million as of Oct 1, 2017.The company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock in the first quarter of 2018. However, its board of directors announced a cash dividend of 40 cents per share on the company's common stock which is payable on Mar 16, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on Mar 5, 2018.Second-quarter Fiscal 2018 GuidanceComps are expected in the range of -1% to 1% at Jack in the Box system restaurants, compared with a 0.8% decline in the year-ago quarter.Fiscal 2018 OutlookComps at Jack in the Box system restaurants are expected to increase 1% to 2%. Restaurant operating margin is anticipated in the range of 22-23%, while Restaurant-Level EBITDA is projected within 26-27%.Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $260-$270 million is expected in the fiscal year. Capital expenditures are estimated roughly in the range of $30-$35 million.Zacks Rank & Peer ReleasesJack in the Box carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3318,CMG,"Domino’sPizza, Inc.’s (DPZ  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 earnings matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues missed the same.Adjusted earnings came in at $1.94 per share and improved 31.1% year over year on higher net income and lower diluted share count as a result of share repurchases.Quarterly revenues were up 8.8% year over year to $891.5 million but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.1%. The improvement was backed by higher supply chain revenues as well as higher royalties from retail sales and positive currency impacts.Domino's Pizza Inc Revenue (TTM) Domino's Pizza Inc Revenue (TTM) | Domino's Pizza Inc QuoteNotably, the fourth quarter marked the 27th consecutive quarter of positive U.S. comparable sales and 96th consecutive quarter of positive international comps. Meanwhile, the company continues to increase store count at a decent pace and opened more than 400 net new stores in the quarter.In a year’s time, Domino’s shares have rallied 17.2% outperforming 8.5% gain of the industry it belongs to.Let’s delve deeper in to the numbers.CompsGlobal retail sales (including total sales of franchise and company-owned units) were up 11.7% year over year. The uptick was primarily owing to strong comps from international stores. Excluding foreign currency impact, global retail sales increased 9.9%.In the quarter under review, the company’s domestic stores (including company-owned and franchise stores) comps improved 4.2%. This compared unfavorably with 7.7% growth in the year-ago quarter and an 8.4% rise in the previous quarter.At domestic company-owned stores, Domino’s experienced year-over-year comps growth of 3.8%, lower than 8.7% comps growth in the year-ago quarter and an 8.4% rise last quarter. Also, domestic franchise stores comps grew 4.2% comparatively lower than comps growth of 7.6% and 8.4%, in the year-ago quarter and the preceding quarter, respectively.Comps at international stores, excluding foreign currency translation, were up 12.1%. This was better than the prior-quarter improvement of 5.1% but lower than the year-ago quarter rise of 14.8%.MarginsDomino’s operating margin increased 40 bps year over year to 31.5% in the quarter under review. Also, the net income margin rose 160 bps to 10.5%. The uptick in the company’s net income was primarily driven by an increase in comps growth and store count as well as higher supply chain volumes and global royalty revenues. The adoption of the new equity-based compensation accounting standard too drove net income. However, the increase was partially offset by rise in net interest expenses on higher net debt levels.Balance SheetAs of Dec 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents were $35.8 million down from $42.8 million as of Jan 1, 2017. Long-term debt as of Dec 31, 2017 was $3.1 billion, down from $2.1 billion million as of Jan 1, 2017.Inventory, at the end of the fourth quarter, amounted to $40 million, down from $40.2 billion in fourth-quarter of 2016.Cash flows from operating activities as of Dec 31, 2017 was $339 million compared with $287.2 million as of Jan 1, 2017.Domino’s spent $90 million on capital expenditures, $84 million on dividends and $1.1 billion on share repurchase in 2017.Zacks Rank & Peer ReleasesDomino's carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

However, Cracker Barrel’s shares have rallied 7.3% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 1.9%.While the company’s sales-building initiatives favored comps growth and the overall top line, expenses related to implementation of these initiatives and commodity inflation remain a concern.Let’s delve deeper into the numbers.Comps DetailsComparable store restaurant sales increased 1.1% in the quarter, including a 2% increase in average check, partially offset by a 0.9% decrease in store traffic.

3320,CMG,"Welcome to Episode #81 of the Value Investor PodcastEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio service, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.The recent stock market correction is impacting stocks across the entire gamut of the stock market, from large cap to small caps. That even includes the golden blue-chip type stocks.The reason some stocks are considered blue chips is because they are considered safe, large cap stocks that aren’t supposed to be volatile in a portfolio. They are also usually owned by a large percentage of investors.Some might even consider them boring.But even the blue chips can run into rocky periods and, for some, that’s happening right now.Some blue chips started to tumble in 2016 and 2017 and the recent correction only added to the losses.Is it time to buy them?Definition of a Value TrapRemember, not all stocks that sell off are values. Some companies may have value fundamentals including low P/E, P/B, P/S ratios. Some may even have value PEG ratios, which means a PEG under 1.0.But that’s not enough. A true value stock will also have earnings growth.The value traps will have all the value fundamentals but earnings estimates will be falling or will be negative year-over-year.The key, then, is to look at the full year earnings estimates.Are These 5 Battered Blue Chips Value Stocks or Traps?Tracey took a look at 5 blue chip stocks that have sold off the last few years to see if there could be a buying opportunity there.1.      General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) continues to sink. It recently hit a new multi-year low. The shares are trading with a forward P/E of 15 now. You’d think these were a bargain, right? After all, it IS GE. But is it a true value?2.     Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) is a mess. After two quarters of disappointing sales, and now a management crisis, the shares are down 14% year-to-date. 2018 earnings are expected to be unchanged versus 2017 despite the largest corporate tax cuts in history. But shares are trading at just 9x. Should you be buying Newell right now?3.     Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) plunged in 2017 but this year it has recovered and is now up 11% year-to-date. Sounds like things could be turning around. But shares now trade with a forward P/E of 68. Are investors too bullish on this athletic apparel and shoe retailer or is there a true earnings turnaround happening here?4.     Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report) saw its shares sink over 14% in 2018 after it reported yet another disappointing quarter. Customer traffic has not rebounded and same store sales remain anemic for a chain that was once the darling of the restaurant industry. The appointment of a former Taco Bell executive to be CEO, however, has boosted the shares off the recent lows. Should value investors be buying with a forward P/E of 30?5.     J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report) was left for dead by investors in 2017. Department stores aren’t going to make it, right? But shares are up 1% year-to-date. With a forward P/E of 20, are earnings finally going in the right direction for this out-of-favor retailer?What else should you know about telling the difference between value stocks and value traps?Tune into this week’s podcast to find out.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

3321,CMG,"Shares of Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report) skyrocketed over 15% on Wednesday after making a massive after-hours move yesterday, as investors seem to be more than happy with the company’s choice of former Taco Bell head Brian Niccol as its new CEO.Chipotle’s recent struggles have been well documented. This prompted founder and former CEO Steve Ells to announce the company was in search of a replacement in late November. After months of searching, the fast-casual burrito chain surprised many investors when it decided to hire the head of Yum! Brands’ (YUM  -  Free Report) eccentric taco chain.Niccol’s selection might seem unconventional considering the fact that Chipotle currently runs nearly the exact opposite type of restaurant chain. However, before today’s gains, shares of Chipotle had plummeted 40% over the last year and 23% in the last four weeks alone. The company needed to take a risk with its new CEO to spark a big change and inspire investor and company-wide confidence.The former head of Taco Bell helped transform the fast-food taco chain into a brand with an identity. From its whacky advertisements and strong social media presence to the constant new food fusions and a successful push into the breakfast market, Niccol seems to know how to grow a restaurant chain.Niccol helped worldwide system sales climb by 7% at Taco Bell in 2017. And even though customers aren’t likely to see crunchy Doritos-infused burritos at Chipotle, big changes are in order.Customers around the U.S. have lost their faith in Chipotle, and their trust won’t be regained overnight, but brands can be rebuilt—and that process needs to start as soon as possible.""At Chipotle's core is delicious food, which I will look to pair up with consistently great customer experiences,” Niccol said. “I will also focus on dialing up Chipotle's cultural relevance through innovation in menu and digital communications.”A big push in digital and social media-based advertising is likely on the horizon, and a menu shake-up beyond its widely-panned queso is due. Only time will tell what the brain behind Taco Bell ends up doing, but his background in out-of-the-box thinking is needed. And for now, investors seem more than pleased with this choice.Niccol is set to officially take over as chief executive officer on March 5, and don’t be surprised if changes happen on his first day.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more. Those gains, however, came with serious volatility and risk. Bitcoin sank 25% or more 3 times in 2017.Zacks has just released a new Special Report to help readers capitalize on the explosive profit potential of Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies with significantly less volatility than buying them directly.See 4 crypto-related stocks now >>

3322,CMG,"Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report) announced on Tuesday afternoon that former Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report) executive Brian Niccol will replace founder Steve Ells as the company’s chief executive. Shares of the struggling fast-casual burrito chain surged over 11% in after-hours trading following the announcement.Chipotle began its search for a CEO to replace Ells, who will become the company’s executive chairman, in late November. The hope was to find someone who could help the brand innovate and build better customer relations as it tries to navigate through a series of public relations nightmares, most of which stem from foodborne sicknesses.Niccol, who most recently served as the CEO of Taco Bell, will take over as chief executive officer on March 5. As the head of Taco Bell, Niccol helped oversee numerous product launches, including some of its new breakfast initiatives.The company also credited Niccol with helping transform the fast-food taco chain into a social media leader, along with leading Taco Bell’s big push into mobile ordering and payment.""His expertise in digital technologies, restaurant operations and branding make him a perfect fit for Chipotle as we seek to enhance our customer experience, drive sales growth and make our brand more relevant,” Ells said in a statement.Niccol helped worldwide system sales climb by 7% at Taco Bell in 2017. But Taco Bell’s constant menu changes and crazy food pairings aren’t likely to work at Chipotle, which is billed as a healthier and hearty, fast-casual option.""At Chipotle's core is delicious food, which I will look to pair up with consistently great customer experiences,” Niccol said. “I will also focus on dialing up Chipotle's cultural relevance through innovation in menu and digital communications.”Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

3324,CMG,"Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report) posted decent fourth-quarter 2017 results, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on earnings but missing the same on revenues.Adjusted earnings of 96 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents. Further, earnings increased 21.5% year over year. The shift to refranchising substantially boosted the company’s operating margin and earnings per share and the trend is expected to continue.Total revenues of $1.58 billion were down 16.4% year over year and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 1.61 billion. The decline in total revenues was mainly due to decrease in company sales as an impact of its continued strategic refranchising initiative.

3325,CMG,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report) recently reported mixed fourth-quarter 2017 results, with earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues lagging the same.Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter were $1.34, surpassing the consensus estimate of $1.32 by 1.5%. Including the 21-cent positive impact from the U.S. tax law, earnings came in at $1.55. Earnings also grew 143.6% year over year on lower costs and higher revenues.Despite the earnings beat, revenue miss, weak 2018 comps guidance and slowdown in planned store openings probably have made investors apprehensive about Chipotle’s sales growth in the near term, resulting in a 5.4% plunge in share price in after-hours trading.Also, the company’s shares have lost 25.2% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 13.5%.Chipotle has been bearing the brunt of a challenging restaurant operating environment and has been particularly plagued by negative publicity related to food-borne illnesses, which had surfaced toward 2015-end. In order to regain reputation and drive sales, the company has been trying to streamline operations and enhance guest experience.Toward this end, Chipotle is focusing on digital innovation. In fact, in the fourth quarter, the company hit new records as its digital sales mix was 8.6% of sales while two of the company’s regions have digital sales of more than 10% of their overall mix. Chipotle is also reinvesting in existing restaurants and trying to improve their appearances and functions.Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. QuoteRevenues and Comparable Restaurant SalesQuarterly revenues of $1.11 billion lagged the consensus estimate of $1.12 billion by 0.9% but grew 7.3% year over year. The revenue growth is primarily attributable to restaurant openings. The company opened 38 new restaurants in the fourth quarter and relocated an additional four restaurants, reaching the total restaurant count to 2,408.The rise in comps somewhat partially favored revenues. Comps in the quarter increased 0.9% which includes a 0.6% reduction related to deferred revenues recognized during the year-ago quarter due to the Chiptopia Summer Rewards program. Comps were driven by an increase in average check, including a 2.4% impact from menu price increase in select restaurants during the second and fourth quarter of 2017, partially offset by a decline in transactions.Costs, Operating Highlights & Net IncomeFood costs, as a percentage of revenues, decreased 110 basis points (bps) to 34.2% driven by cost savings in paper and packaging usage as well as higher menu prices. Favorable avocado prices during the quarter, when compared with the prior-year quarter, also led to cost reduction.General and administrative expenses comprised 5.2% of total revenues, reflecting a decrease of 110 bps year over year. This can be attributed to lower legal costs and non-cash stock-based compensation expenses.Restaurant level operating margin was 14.9%, up 140 bps from 13.5% in the year-ago quarter. The upside was primarily driven by reduced food, beverage and packaging expenses and lowered promotional activities.Net income inthe quarter was $43.8 million, up from $16.0 million in the prior-year quarter, courtesy of $6.0 million gain from changes in the U.S. tax law.Balance SheetCash and cash equivalents as of Dec 31, 2017, were $184.6 million compared with $87.9 million as of Dec 31, 2016.Inventory totaled $19.9 million as of Dec 31, 2017, up from $15 million as of Dec 31, 2016. Goodwill, as a percentage of total assets, was 1.07% at the end of 2017 compared with 1.08% in the prior year.Total shareholder’s equity was $1.36 billion as of Dec 31, 2017, compared with $1.40 billion as of Dec 31, 2016.2017 HighlightsRevenues in 2017 increased 14.7% to $4.5 billion, with comps growing 6.4%. Diluted earnings per share were $6.17, including a benefit of 21 cents per share resulting from changes in U.S. tax law, compared with 77 cents in 2016.Restaurant level operating margin was 16.9%, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 410 bps. Net income in 2017 was $176.3 million, showing an improvement from $22.9 million last year.The company opened 183 new restaurants in the year and relocated 25 more, including 15 ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen Restaurants.2018 OutlookFor 2018, management expects comps increase of low single digits and expects to launch130-150 restaurants. Effective tax rate is estimated in the range of 30% to 31%, which includes an underlying effective tax rate of about 27% to 28% and the effect of prior year employee equity plans.Zacks Rank & Peer Releases.Chipotle carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3329,CMG,"We are in the thick of the Q4 earnings season with 251 of the S&P 500 members having already reported their quarterly numbers (as of Feb 2).The Picture Thus FarPer the Earnings Preview, total earnings for these 251 companies are up a solid 16% from the year-ago quarter on a 10.5% rise in revenues. While 64.9% of these companies have beaten estimates on both counts, 80.5% surpassed earnings estimates and 78.1% exceeded top-line expectations.Restaurant Players Have Impressed So FarWe note that performance of restaurant players has been decent so far this earnings season. Among the restaurant stocks that have already reported, McDonald's Corp. (MCD  -  Free Report) and Darden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report) posted robust fourth-quarter 2017 and fiscal second-quarter 2018 results, respectively, beating earnings and revenue estimates. Meanwhile, Brinker International, Inc. (EAT  -  Free Report) posted mixed second-quarter fiscal 2018, with earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues lagging the same.The year 2017 saw the space grappling with rising costs, weak comps, higher restaurant prices, consumer spending uncertainty on dining out, decline in at-home food costs, market saturation and shifting preference of consumers.However, the industry remains steady, thanks to the counter-strategies of some innovative operators. These include various sales building and cost cutting efforts, franchisee-based business models, loyalty programs and most importantly increased usage of technology.The Broader Sector Looks StrongThe restaurant industry belongs to the broader Retail-Wholesale sector, which is expected to deliver strong performance this earnings season. Overall, fourth-quarter earnings for the sector are expected to be up 6.6% year over year, with revenues anticipated to rise 8.8%.Given this backdrop, let’s see what’s in store for three industry players slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Buffalo Wild Wings’  for earnings and revenues is pegged at $1.56 per share and $543 million, respectively. The estimates, when compared with the year-ago quarter’s actual figures, indicate growth of 79.3% for earnings and 9.9% for revenues. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The company’s quarterly revenues are likely to benefit from sales initiatives such as game day offers and take up programs for holiday parties, while earnings are likely to increase with continuous operational improvement and cost saving efforts.Buffalo Wild Wings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Buffalo Wild Wings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Buffalo Wild Wings, Inc. QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Dunkin' Brands Group (DNKN  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $223 million, reflecting 3.2% growth from the year-ago quarter’s actual figure. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 63 cents, reflecting 1.6% declinefrom the year-ago quarter’s actual figure.We expect the company’s top line to benefit from system-wide sales growth backed by franchise fees and royalty income, and strong rental income. License fees related to Dunkin' Donuts K-Cup pods and ready-to-drink bottled iced coffee, along with increased transfer fee income are also expected to strengthen the top line.The bottom line, however, is likely to stay under pressure as the company anticipates roughly $6 million of incremental interest expense from a recent debt deal and a higher effective tax rate resulting from reserve of foreign tax credit carry-forwards in the third quarter. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2.Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. QuoteQuick-casual and fresh Mexican food restaurant chain operator Chipotle Mexican Grill’s (CMG  -  Free Report) results are likely to benefit from continued focus on food safety, simplification of restaurant operations, menu innovation, enhancing digital orders and increased brand marketing. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and revenues is pegged at $1.33 per share and $1.1 billion, respectively.The earnings estimates, when compared with the year-ago quarter’s actual figure, indicate a remarkable increase of 78 cents.

3330,CMG,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings results on Feb 6, after market close.In the last reported quarter, the company missed earnings by 14.74%. However, it recorded earnings beats in three of the trailing four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 4.88%.Chipotle has been particularly plagued by negative publicity related to food-borne illnesses, which surfaced toward 2015-end and continued through 2016. Since then, the company has undertaken many safety measures and sales-building initiatives to revive its top line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.12 billion, reflecting 8.5% year-over-year growth. In the first nine months of 2017, revenues grew 17.3% year over year.Notably, shares of the company have lost 23.3% in the past year, massively underperforming the industry’s gain of 20.7%.Let’s take a look at how the company’s top and bottom lines will shape up in the to-be-reported quarter.Sales-Boosting Initiatives to PayoffWe believe that revenue growth at Chipotle is dependent on sales-building strategies. The company is continuously trying to recover sales by shifting its strategy from giveaways, discounts and rewards to new menu items, operational excellence and enhancement of guest experience. Toward this end, Chipotle rolled out queso nationally in the third quarter of 2017 following which the company witnessed an immediate uptick in sales and expects higher sales in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Further, marketing activities like transaction-driving promotions and advertising along with increased focus on delivery services and new ordering digital partnerships are likely to drive the top line in the quarter to be reported.Notably, to deal with the negative publicity from food security issues, Chipotle uses only 51 real ingredients to prepare its entire range of food items, in stark contrast to most other fast food chains. Also, the company has undertaken an inclusive assessment of its food safety programs and practices to enhance the quality and safety of food.Chipotle is also focusing on developing new food safety protocols, which include DNA-based testing of several ingredients coupled with changes to food preparation and food handling practices. The company’s enhanced focus on making better food accessible to everyone should also drive traffic in the fourth quarter.High Costs Unlikely to Hurt EarningsIn order to regain consumer trust, post the food security issue, Chipotle has been incurring high marketing and promo expenses which are likely to dent profits. In fact, Chipotle expects fourth-quarter combined marketing and promo costs to account for nearly 4% of sales as the majority of its national ad campaign has occurred in the quarter.Also, the implementation of food safety practices has increased the amount of labor required to prepare and serve food, resulting in higher labor costs which may continue to keep profits under pressure.Despite the possibility of a further spike in costs, the consensus estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.35, reflecting 145.5% year-over-year growth and a lesser impact of costs on earnings. We believe that the company’s strong sales will significantly offset cost impacts in the fourth quarter.Our Quantitative Model Does Not Predict a BeatChipotle does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of -1.19%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Chipotle has a Zacks Rank #3.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.

3331,CMG,"McDonald's Corp. (MCD  -  Free Report) posted robust results for the fourth quarter of 2017, wherein both top and the bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.71 surpassed the consensus mark of $1.59 by 7.5% and improved 19% from the year-ago quarter (16% in constant currencies). The upside reflects stronger operating performance and G&A savings.Meanwhile, foreign currency translation had a positive impact of 4 cents per share on earnings in the quarter. Notably, adjusted earnings exclude the impact of a net tax cost associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.McDonald’s plans to invest $2.4 billion in 2018, mostly toward accelerating deployment of its Experience of the Future in the United States, which focuses on adding technology to its eateries.Shares of McDonald’s have gained 42.5% over the past year, significantly outperforming the industry’s 22% rally.McDonald's Corporation Price McDonald's Corporation price | McDonald's Corporation QuoteRevenues Decline but Global Comps Improve Revenues of $5.34 billion beat the consensus mark of $5.26 billion by 1.5% but declined 11.4% year over year. The decline reflects the impact of the company’s strategic refranchising initiative.Revenues at company-operated restaurants declined 26.8% year over year to $2.67 billion. However, the same at franchise-operated restaurants increased 12.2% to $2.67 billion.Global comps grew 5.5%, supported by encouraging guest count across segments. This marked the tenth consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales. Meanwhile, comps growth was slightly lower than the last quarter’s increase of 6%.Solid Comps Across SegmentsU.S.: Comps grew 4.5% in the fourth quarter driven by solid performance of core menu items under the McPick 2 platform and beverage value, as well as robust consumer response to new Buttermilk Crispy Tenders and delivery. Comps growth was slightly better than the prior quarter rise of 4.1%.Segment operating income increased 4% on the back of higher sales-driven franchised margin dollars and G&A savings, partially offset by lower company-operated margin dollars.International Lead Markets: Comps at this segment grew 6% year over year, higher than 5.7% rise witnessed in the last quarter. Continued momentum in the United Kingdom and Canada along with upbeat results across all other markets drove comps.Operating income was up 14%, including the impact of foreign currency translation. At constant currency, the figure was up 7%, primarily on the back of sales-driven improvements in franchised margin dollars.High-Growth Markets: Comps grew 4%, lower than the prior-quarter’s increase of 6.2%, led by strong performance in China as well as positive results across majority of the segments, partially offset by continual challenges in South Korea.Foundational Markets: Comps in Foundational Markets grew 8% on the back of positive sales performance across all geographic regions.

3332,CMG,"Regency Centers Corporation (REG  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has acquired The District at Metuchen — a Whole Foods Market-anchored shopping center — in Metuchen, NJ. The move comes as part of the retail real estate investment trust’s (REIT) strategic efforts to expand in this market.Spanning 66,000 square feet of space, this shopping center is situated in the thriving downtown. It enjoys proximity to the I-287 and I-95 interchange. These are the main arteries of the metro New York market. Moreover, the Metuchen and Metropark stations are located nearby which services a total of 11,000 commuters each weekday.Also, Metuchen enjoys high barriers to entry, while the immediate area is experiencing an inflow for residential needs. These raises hope for a greater footfall at this center and hence the buyout seems a strategic one. Further, besides Whole Foods Market, the property has other notable names in its tenant roster, including European Wax, Title Boxing, and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG  -  Free Report).Notably, mall traffic continues to suffer amid rapid shift in consumers’ shopping preferences toward online channels, resulting in an increasing number of retailers jumping on the dot-com bandwagon. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent times. In fact, the decision to close stores by a number of reputable retailers like Macy's, Inc. (M  -  Free Report) and J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report) have raised concerns over cash flows of mall landlords.However, at such a time, Regency’s focus on building a premium portfolio of grocery-anchored shopping centers, which are usually necessity driven, augurs well. Such centers are usually necessity driven and steer a dependable traffic.Moreover, groceries mark one of the major categories of U.S. consumer spending. Although online retailers have made efforts to penetrate deeper into the grocery business, only a minimal percentage of U.S. grocery shopping takes place online.Regency currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3334,CMG,"(0:15) - Beaten Down Blue Chip Stocks: Are They A Value?(2:00) - Tracey's Top Stock Picks(11:40) - Ticker Recap and Extra Tips(13:35) - Episode Roundup: Podcast@Zacks.comWelcome to Episode #69 of the Value Investor PodcastEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio service, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.Not everything is gumdrops and roses for every stock right now, despite the indexes hitting new all-time highs.Some large cap names have sold off in 2017, including a couple that have hit multi-year lows.Tracey hears a lot of people calling those stocks “value” stocks, but are they? Does a sell-off in the shares automatically make it a value?Value Stocks Are More Than the ChartTracey has done podcasts on value stocks that were breaking out, so the chart isn’t the end all, be all, of value investing.Value investors buy stocks trading at a discount to their earnings. Therefore, earnings are the key. Are they rising or falling? Investors need to know avoid the “value trap” scenario where a stock appears cheap, but that’s because the earnings are on the decline.Tracey took a look at five blue chip stocks that have been in the news recently, mostly for their weak stocks.Are These 5 Blue Chip Stocks Value Stocks?1.      General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) has plunged to 5-year lows. Surely, with all the bad news that’s there, including a dividend cut, there must be some value, right? However, it’s forward P/E is 17.2, which still isn’t that cheap. What does the earnings forecast reveal?2.     Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) is dirt cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of just 5.9. Shares are down 43% this year, however, on worries that the department stores are doomed. But are the earnings estimates really signaling the end is near?3.     Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) was weak through May and has since rallied. Shares, however, are still well under the 2015 highs. It trades with an attractive forward P/E of 14.3 but does it have the earnings growth to get the thumbs up?4.     Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report) is still down over 20% year-to-date and near 5-year lows. But are the shares cheap enough, and the earnings growing fast enough, to qualify it for the coveted value stock designation?5.     Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report) shares are weak compared to the S&P 500. Exxon is down 11% year-to-date, but are off their 2017 lows. With crude hanging out above $50 pretty consistently, are the oil stock earnings finally showing a rebound?Remember, the Price-to-Earnings ratio is predicated on both price AND earnings. Value investors need to check those earnings before deciding that a stock is “cheap.”What else should you know about beaten down blue-chip stocks?Listen to this week’s podcast to find out.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

3335,CMG,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in CMG.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen 15 estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $7.33 a share a month ago to its current level of $6.64.Also, for the current quarter, Chipotle Mexican Grill has seen 13 downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to $1.37 a share from $1.76 over the past 30 days.  The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 13.4% in the past month.Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.

QuoteSo it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don’t have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Retail - Restaurants industry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock - Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc.

3336,CMG,"DineEquity, Inc. (DIN  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings of 91 cents per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 88 cents by 3.4%. However, the figure declined 37.8% from the prior-year quarter earnings of $1.46 due to decrease in gross profits.Total revenues of $144.7 million fell 7.3% year over year due to lower franchise and restaurant, rental as well as financing revenues. Also, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $146.5 million by over 1%.DineEquity currently operates under the Applebee's Neighborhood Grill & Bar and International House of Pancakes (IHOP) brands. It is focused on developing a strong performance-based culture, driving sustainable positive sales at both brands thereby bringing its growth story back on track. In fact, the initial progress along with positive comps growth at both brands in October is heartening and management is optimistic on realizing the company's full potential.Consequently, the company’s shares were up more than 5% in yesterday’s trading session, reflecting investors’ confidence regarding the initiatives undertaken to drive growth at both the brands.Behind the Headline NumbersIHOP's domestic system-wide comps declined 3.2%. This compares unfavorably with the fiscal second quarter’s comps decrease of 2.6% and the prior-year quarter’s comps decline of 0.1%. Despite witnessing soft sales in the last few quarters, the company believes that the IHOP brand remains on solid ground.Moreover, initiatives to improve guest satisfaction via remodelling efforts, growing its off-premise business that include online ordering and delivery, and development of an IHOP mobile application are expected to create improved revenue channels.Applebee's domestic system-wide comps were down 7.7% comparing unfavorably with the last quarter’s comps decline of 6.2% and the prior-year quarter’s fall of 5.2%. Notably, Applebee’s casual dining restaurants are facing stiff competition from fast-food and quick-service restaurants. Furthermore, consumers are favoring ordering in meals over going to brick-and-mortar retailers.Nonetheless, DineEquity believes that fiscal 2017 will be a transitional year for Applebee's. In fact, the steps taken to revitalize the brand via increased focus on food and culinary innovation, marketing efforts, simplification of restaurant operations and elevating the guest experience are expected to drive comps over the long term with an improvement likely 2018 onwards.Fiscal 2017 OutlookFor fiscal 2017, Applebee's domestic system-wide comps are now expected to decrease in the range of 5.5-6.5% (a decline of 6% to 8%, expected earlier).IHOP's domestic system-wide comps are still expected to be down in the band of 1% to 3%.Meanwhile, DineEquity continues to expect general and administrative expenses to range between $166 million and $172 million.Applebee's franchisees are still anticipated to develop between 20 and 30 new restaurants globally, the majority of which are likely to be international openings. Additionally, its closures are projected to range between roughly 105 and 135 restaurants.  IHOP franchisees and its area licensee are estimated to develop between 80 and 95 restaurants globally, with the majority being domestic openings. IHOP closures are anticipated to range between 25 and 30 restaurants (earlier 20-25 restaurants).  The company also reiterated its expectations of capital expenditures of roughly $14 million in fiscal 2017.DineEquity carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3337,CMG,"Zoe’s Kitchen, Inc.’s  third-quarter fiscal 2017 results were affected by the recent hurricanes — Harvey and Irma.Adjusted earnings of a penny in the quarter bettered the Zacks Consensus Estimate of break-even earnings. However, earnings deteriorated 75% from the year-ago figure of 4 cents owing to the impact of hurricanes and lower restaurant contribution margin. The hurricanes particularly impacted earnings by 2 cents.Revenues of $77.9 million lagged the consensus mark of $78.6 million by 1% but improved 15.7% year over year backed by restaurant openings. In fact, Zoe’s Kitchen opened 11 company-owned restaurants in the quarter and expects to open another 38 to 40 this year.However, due to the natural disasters, this fast-casual restaurant chain lost 187 full and partial operating days leading up to roughly $1.1 million of revenue loss.Zoe's Kitchen, Inc.

However, it compared favorably with the prior-quarter’s comps decline of 3.8%.Restaurant contribution margin went down 30 basis points (bps) year over year to 18.8% as increased labor and operating expenses offset the improvement in cost of goods.2017 Fiscal Outlook CutFor fiscal 2017, the company expects total revenues of $314.0 million to $316.0 million (earlier $314-$322 million).Meanwhile, management projects comps in the range of negative 2% to 2.5% (earlier flat to negative 3%).Further, the company predicts restaurant contribution margin in the band of 18.3% to 18.5%, as compared with the previous range of 18.3% to 19.0%.We note that Zoe’s Kitchen currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Peer ReleasesChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.’s (CMG  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.33 lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.56 by 14.7%.Darden Restaurants, Inc.’s (DRI  -  Free Report) first-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings of 99 cents per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents by more than 1%.

This improvement was driven primarily by new restaurant openings.Behind the Headline NumbersCompany-owned restaurants comps decreased 0.1% year over year, as against the prior-quarter comps increase of 0.5%. The downturn was led by a 0.1% decline in average guest check and flat guest counts. Notably, the decrease in average guest check comprised a 1.6% drop in menu mix, partly offset by a 1.5% increase in pricing.Restaurant-level operating profit margin decreased 120 basis points (bps) to 17.4% due to rise in occupancy costs, higher cost of sales, elevated labor costs and increase in other restaurant operating expenses.Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITDA) decreased 4.9% to $25.5 million from $26.8 million in the year-ago quarter.Fourth-Quarter ViewFor the fourth quarter, earnings per share are estimated between 45 cents and 60 cents.

3339,CMG,"El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc.’s (LOCO  -  Free Report) earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter of 2017.Notably, the company’s shares lost more than 7% in after-hours trading on Nov 2, reflecting investor concerns regarding the slashed guidance for 2017 earnings.Earnings and Revenue DiscussionEl Pollo Loco’s third-quarter adjusted earnings of 15 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 18 cents by 16.7%. Earnings also declined 16.7% year over year primarily due to the impact of hurricane Harvey.Revenues of $101.2 million rose 5.6% year over year but lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $103.2 million by 2%. El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc. Quote Behind the Headline NumbersNotably, system-wide comps increased 1.7% due to an increase in comps at both company-operated and franchise restaurants.Company-operated restaurant sales totaled $95 million in the third quarter of 2017, compared with $89.7 million in the year-ago quarter. Sales rose 5.9% year-over-year mainly on the back of the opening of 25 new restaurants during and subsequent to the third quarter of 2016, offset by the closing down of five over the same time frame.Moreover, comps at company-operated restaurants increased 0.9% on a 1.7% rise in average check. However, it was partially offset by a 0.8% decline in transactions. Moreover, the figure compared unfavorably with the prior quarter comps growth of 2.4%.Franchise-operated restaurant sales increased 1.6% year over year to $6.2 million compared with $6.1 million in the prior-year quarter. The upside was mainly driven by higher comps and the launch of 15 restaurants during and subsequent to the third quarter of 2016, partly offset by a decline in franchise and development agreement fees and lower fees received related to use of the company’s point-of-sales system.Comps at Franchise restaurants were up 2.4% during the quarter, lower than the prior quarter comps growth of 3.2%.Restaurant contribution was $17.4 million (18.3% of company-operated restaurant revenues), compared with $18.8 million (20.9%) in the third quarter of 2016. The drop in restaurant contribution margin was mainly due to elevated labor charges reflecting the increased minimum wage, and higher other operating expenses associated with restaurant openings.2017 Outlook RevisedEl Pollo Loco now expects 2017 pro forma earnings per share in the band of 61 cents to 63 cents, down from the earlier guided range of 64 cents to 67 cents. In 2016, adjusted earnings per share were 66 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings is also pegged at 66 cents, above the guide range.Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization) is expected in the band of $64.0 million to $65.5 million (earlier $66.5 million to $68.5 million). Meanwhile, restaurant contribution margin is projected in the range of 19.3% to 19.6% (earlier 20.3% to 20.7%).Furthermore, the company expects system-wide comparable restaurant sales growth in the range of 1-1.5% (earlier 1-2%).The company revised the range of its restaurant opening and now plans to open 15-16 company-owned restaurants in 2017 (earlier 17 to19).

3341,CMG,"Shake Shack Inc. (SHAK  -  Free Report) posted mixed third-quarter 2017 results, wherein though earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues fell slightly short of the same.Notably, shares were up nearly 5% in afterhours trading on Nov 1 as the company raised its sales forecast for the year on the back of stepped-up expansion plans.Earnings and Revenue DiscussionShake Shack’s adjusted earnings of 17 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 15 cents by 13.3%. Also, the figure rose 13.3% year over year given an increase in revenues.Revenues surged 26.9% year over year to $94.6 million and came almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $94.7 million. An increase in Shack sales and licensing revenues, led to the improvement.Evidently, Shack sales rose 26.8% year over year to $91.1 million, primarily owing to the opening of 21 new domestic company-operated Shacks. This was partly offset by decline in same-Shack sales (or comps) as well as lost revenues, given hurricane-related Shack closures. Meanwhile, licensing revenues for the quarter came in at $3.5 million, up 30.2% year over year backed by opening of new licensed Shacks.Behind the Headline NumbersSame-Shack sales (or comps) declined 1.6% year over year due to a 3.8% decrease in guest traffic, partly offset by a combined increase in price and sales mix of 2.2%. Comps compared favorably with prior-quarter comps decline of 1.8% and unfavorably with rise of 2.9% in the year-ago quarter.Total operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, increased 110 basis points (bps) to 88.8% mainly on an 80-bps increase in labor costs and 90-bps rise in both other operating expenses as well as depreciation expenses. However, these were somewhat offset by a decline of 90 bps and 70 bps in general and administrative expenses (G&A) and pre-opening costs, respectively.As a percentage of Shack sales, Shack-level operating profit margins decreased 160 bps to 27.2% primarily due to increased labor and related expenses as well as certain higher operating costs.Adjusted EBITDA (earning before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) increased 19.9% to $18.2 million. However, as a percentage of total revenue, adjusted EBITDA margins declined roughly 110 bps to 19.2% from 20.3% in the year-ago quarter.2017 OutlookShake Shack has updated its full-year 2017 guidance.The company raised the lower end of its revenue guidance and now expects the same to be between $354 million and $355 million (earlier $351–$355 million).Currently, it projects Same-Shack sales to be down in the range of 1.5% to 2% year over year compared with the decline in the band of 2-3%, anticipated earlier.Shack-level operating profit margin is guided between 26.5% and 27% (earlier 26.5% to 27.5%), while general and administrative expenses are still anticipated between $38 million and $40 million.Given the strength of its development pipeline, the company now expects to open 24 to 26 new domestic company-operated Shacks in 2017, up from 23-24 guided earlier, and 18 net new licensed Shacks, up from 15 announced earlier, representing unit growth of roughly 39% and 36%, respectively.Preliminary 2018 ViewBuilding on the momentum, the company has stepped up its development plans for 2018 and intends to make it the company’s biggest year of openings to date. Notably, it expects to open 32 to 35 new domestic company-operated Shacks and 16 to18 net new licensed Shacks in 2018.Shake Shack, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Shake Shack, Inc.

3342,CMG,"We are in the thick of the Q3 earnings season with results seemingly on solid ground given the positive momentum on the revenue front. Apart from maintaining the above-average proportion of positive earnings surprises, the estimate revision trend for the December quarter is quite palpable.According to our latest Earnings Preview, 64.2% of the total market capitalization of S&P 500 is already out. As of Oct 27, 2017, total earnings for the 272 S&P 500 members are up 8.7% year over year on 6.7% higher revenues. Of these, 75.7% surpassed earnings estimates, while 66.2% beat revenue expectations.A Look at the Restaurant IndustryWe note that the performance of the restaurant industry, under the broader Retail-Wholesale sector, has been mixed so far this earnings season. Among the restaurant stocks that have reported, Domino’s Pizza Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) posted robust results, beating earnings and revenue estimates.McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) posted mixed third-quarter 2017 results. While earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues fell short of the same. However, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report) lagged on both fronts.Soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space along with rising costs continue to haunt restaurant chains. Also, the recent hurricanes seem to have negatively impacted results of a number of restaurant companies this earnings season, which includes the likes of BJ’s Restaurants, Inc. (BJRI  -  Free Report)    that reported lower-than-expected results in third-quarter fiscal 2017.Nonetheless, innovative operators with strong fundamentals are continuing to exhibit strength even in a not-so-favorable environment.Let’s have a sneak peek at two major restaurant stocks scheduled to report earnings tomorrow to see how things are shaping before the announcement.Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results.We expect Starbucks’ revenues to increase on the back of an addition of new restaurants and positive global comparable store sales or simply comps growth. Starbucks also projected global comps growth at 3-4% for the quarter. Comps in the fiscal fourth quarter are likely to be driven by significant menu innovations like new and improved Bistro Boxes, Seared Steak and Egg Wrap.Starbucks’ digital offering, Mobile Order and Pay, is also witnessing increased usage and could prove to be a key growth driver in the to-be-reported quarter as well as in 2017. Again, growth in Starbucks reward members is expected to contribute to its revenue growth in the to-be-reported quarter.The company had earlier revealed that it expects stronger revenue growth in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by mid-single digit comps including accelerating comps in the United States. Overall, for the fiscal fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $5.73 billion, implying 0.4% year-over-year growth.With respect to the company’s bottom line, Starbucks’ EPS is likely to witness a decline in the third quarter due to a rise in cost of sales and higher goodwill and other asset impairment expenses for the closing of 379 Teavana stores. Hence, despite a revenue-growth expectation, the coffee giant’s margins are likely to narrow due to higher cost of sales as a result of commodity inflation. These headwinds, however, are likely to be offset by lower general and administrative (G&A) expenses.That said, a challenging environment in the United States restaurant space might be a cause for concern for investors in the near term.For the fiscal fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 55 cents a share, reflecting a decrease of 2.5% year over year.Meanwhile, our proven model does not conclusively show that Starbucks is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components.For the impending quarter, the company has an Earnings ESP of -0.08%. Starbucks currently has Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), making an earnings prediction uncertain. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 for a likely earnings beat.

Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 numbers before the opening bell.Post China business separation, Yum! Brands endeavors to drive growth by employing greater focus on the development of its three iconic global brands, increasing its franchise ownership, and creating a leaner and more efficient cost structure bodes well. This, in turn, is likely to bolster third-quarter results.Particularly, augmented pace of unit development along with increased investments in technology-driven initiatives is anticipated to somewhat drive top-line growth in the quarter.Coming to the Pizza Hut brand, while the international division might continue doing well, Pizza Hut U.S. is expected to post soft results for the quarter despite numerous strategic efforts similar to the last few quarters. Notably, a soft consumer-spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space is likely to continue restricting revenue growth.Meanwhile, KFC’s efforts to revamp outlets, focus on its operational excellence, delivery services, innovation and convenience, are expected to continue boosting comps.However, Yum! Brands is likely to witness a decline in company sales due to the impact of its strategic refranchising initiative, which, in turn, will lower the company’s revenues in the third quarter. A slowdown in emerging markets is likely to further hamper the quarter’s performance.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings of 66 cents implies a year-over-year decline of 39.5%. The same for revenues is pegged at $1.39 billion, 58.2% lower than the prior-year quarter figure.Meanwhile, our proven model does not conclusively show that Yum! Brands is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. For the impending quarter, the company has an Earnings ESP of -1.37%.

Brands have delivered positive surprises in the trailing four quarters. However, Yum! Brands’ average beat of 7.01% steers past Starbucks’ level of 0.46%.From the sales growth perspective, Starbucks is well positioned to report better quarterly results.Meanwhile, both the companies are expected to report a decline in earnings.

Comps at system-wide international restaurants increased 5.3%, lower than comps growth of 7.6% a year ago but higher than 3.9% in the preceding quarter.G&A costs decreased 1% year over year in the quarter.

3344,CMG,"The Q3 earnings season is well under way with 272 of the S&P 500 members having already reported their quarterly numbers (as of Oct 27).Per the Earnings Preview, total earnings for these 272 companies are up a solid 8.7% from the year-ago quarter, courtesy a 6.7% rise in revenues. While, 75.7% of the companies that have reported their quarterly numbers surpassed earnings estimate, 66.2% exceeded top-line expectations.Turning our focus to the widely popular restaurant industry, we note that the performance of the players here has been mixed so far this earnings season.Among the restaurant stocks that have reported, Domino’s Pizza Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) posted robust results beating earnings and revenue estimates. Meanwhile, McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) posted mixed third-quarter 2017 results. While earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues fell short of the same. However, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report) lagged on both fronts.A soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space along with rising costs are continuing to haunt restaurant chains. Also, the recent hurricanes seem to have impacted results for a number of restaurant companies in the quarter including the likes of BJ’s Restaurants, Inc. (BJRI  -  Free Report) that reported lower-than-expected results in third-quarter fiscal 2017.Nonetheless, innovative operators with strong fundamentals are continuing to exhibit strength even in a not-so-favorable environment.Markedly, the three restaurant companies that are set to report their quarterly results on Nov 1, have a significant exposure to the hurricane affected areas. This may result in sales decline in the quarter due to destruction caused by the same.Despite these headwinds, will these companies manage to put up a decent performance? Let’s take a look at what might be in store for these companies:Shake Shack Inc. (SHAK  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 25.00% in the last reported quarter. In fact, it outpaced/met earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 12.50%.Shake Shack, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Shake Shack, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Shake Shack, Inc. QuoteOur proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Shake Shack this quarter. This is because, according to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase its odds of an earnings surprise.For the third quarter of 2017, the company has an Earnings ESP of -4.25% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter's earnings is pegged at 15 cents, reflecting an increase of 1% over the prior-year quarter. Also, revenues are expected to improve 27.2% year over year to $94.9 million. An increase in Shack sales and licensing revenues are likely to aid the top line in the quarter. In fact, the consensus estimate of $92 million for Shack sales and $3.4 million for licensing revenues in the quarter, reflects a year-over-year improvement of 27.8% and 24.8%, respectively.Apart from the adverse affects of the hurricanes, a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space might limit revenue growth and hurt comps. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for the quarter’s comps to witness a decline of 2.5%. Comps grew 2.9% in the year-ago quarter (read more: Will Higher Revenues Drive Shake Shack's Q3 Earnings?).The Cheesecake Factory Inc. (CAKE  -  Free Report) pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 2.63%. In fact, the company witnessed earnings beat/meet in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 4.00%.The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated QuoteWe note that Cheesecake Factory is unlikely to post a beat in the third-quarter fiscal 2017 due to the combination of its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of -2.29%.As it is we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Higher labor costs, pre-opening costs of outlets and expenses related with the execution of the initiatives are expected to keep profits under pressure. Markedly, the consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at 60 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 13.7%. Nevertheless, the company's initiatives to boost sales and traffic are likely to somewhat boost comps and drive the top line. Besides, the consensus estimate for the quarter's sales is projected at $562.8 million, reflecting a 0.5% year-over-year increase.Meanwhile, in addition to the hurricane woes, Cheesecake factory is plagued by declining sales given a soft industry backdrop. In fact, the company expects a 1% to 2% decline in comps for the to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for comps decline is pegged at 1.6%. In the year-ago quarter, the company witnessed comps growth of 1.7% (read more: Will Soft Comps Hurt Cheesecake Factory Q3 Earnings?).Brinker International, Inc.

The same for revenues is projected to be $756.5 million, down a slight 0.3% from the prior-year quarter.Though aggressive expansion plans along with various strategic initiatives are expected to somewhat boost comps, declining traffic trends at its restaurants might hurt the same and in turn sales.

3345,CMG,"After the revival of Trump bump, Wall Street seems to have taken a breather. The Dow Industrials and S&P 500 indexes underwent their worst day in seven weeks on Oct 25. The S&P 500, NASDAQ Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average lost about 0.5% each on that day (read: 5 Biggest ETF Winners of Trump Trade Resurgence).   The broader market had a great run since Trump announced plans for tax reform in late September. However, the double whammy of rising rates and subdued earnings weighed on the market recently, if we go by an article published on Reuters. On Oct 25, 207, yield on 10-year benchmark Treasury yield was 2.44%. Yields have been on an uptrend on faster Fed policy-tightening projections. A prolonged source of easy money contributed to the eight-year long bull market greatly. Now, indications of fast ceases in easy dollars may cut the rally.Plus, overvaluation concerns have been rife in the U.S. equity market for quite some time now. Though the ongoing earnings season has been pretty upbeat, investors probably have started analyzing to what extent this surge in earnings justify the inflated valuations, as per the Reuters article.If this was not enough, lackluster earnings from AT&T (T  -  Free Report) (down 3.9%) weighed on indexes. Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) and Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report) lost about 2.9%, 13.5% and 14.6% on Oct 25 as an aftershock of earnings or guidance disaster.Amid all the upheavals, volatility levels flared up, with iPath S&P 500 VIX ST Futures ETN (VXX  -  Free Report)) rising about 3.1% on Oct 25. These worries may keep the stock market volatile, giving investors a chance to ride it out through inverse ETFs.

Moreover, earnings decreased 12.5% from the year-ago figure of 56 cents, primarily due to increased expenses.Revenues of $265.8 million were up 6.2% year over year given an increase in total operating weeks, somewhat offset by lower weekly sales average.

Moreover, operating margin decreased 310 bps to 4.7%. Notably, a 20-bps decrease in general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, was more than offset by 120 bps and 60 bps increases in cost of sales as well as occupancy and operating costs, respectively. Additionally, labor and benefits charges increased 110 bps, thereby exerting substantial pressure on operating margin.BJ's Restaurants, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  BJ's Restaurants, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | BJ's Restaurants, Inc. QuoteGoing ForwardIn order to navigate the challenging macroeconomic situation, the company is consistently following up on several major sales building initiatives, which have been tested over the past year.Notably, it has completed the installation of new slow roasting ovens in all its restaurants including extensive team member training and menu sampling for the new slow roasted items. Moreover, BJ’s Restaurants has rolled out new server hand-held ordering tablets at all its restaurants.In fact, the initial results from these initiatives have been positive and the company has been witnessing an increase in average check and improvement in order times.Given the fact that off-premise sales represent a considerable revenue growth opportunity, the company has been undertaking various efforts to enhance delivery and take-out services. In fact, it intends to leverage on its highly rated mobile app and website along with new third-party delivery partners to drive growth in off-premise sales.In this regard, BJ’s Restaurants partnered with technology company DoorDash in July to initially launch door-to-door delivery at 61 BJ’s Restaurant & Brewhouse locations in 12 metro areas.Along with these strategic initiatives, the company has expanded its daily Brewhouse specials offerings, developed a deep pipeline of new menu items, enhanced its loyalty program and undertaken other productivity initiatives that are likely to drive further growth.BJ’s Restaurants carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
