0,SWKS,"Apple (AAPL) is facing a steady drip of reports that iPhone sales are slowing, resulting in production cuts at its contract manufacturers in Asia.X The latest such reports are from Wall Street firms Nomura Instinet, JPMorgan and Bernstein. Bernstein said Wednesday that it sees iPhone unit sales of 76 million to 84 million, or 80 million at the midpoint, in the December quarter, vs. the consensus estimate of 79.2 million.But Apple could give implied iPhone unit guidance for the March quarter that is well below consensus estimates of 62.1 million, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said in a note to clients. Apple could guide to 51 million to 57 million iPhone unit sales for the current quarter, he said.""Our analysis points to a sequential decline in iPhone units of 33%, which is only modestly higher than the (roughly) 30% decline Apple has seen in each of the last two years from December to March,"" Sacconaghi said. Bernstein rates Apple stock as outperform with a price target of 195.Apple shares fell 1.6% to close at 174.22 on the stock market today. Apple has fallen below the buy point of 176.34 it reached on Dec. 18, after it broke out of a five-week flat base. It struggled to remain above that level in the weeks that followed, but managed to notch an all-time high of 180.10 last Thursday.Bernstein also said December-quarter iPhone sales are shaping up in line with expectations, while March-quarter sales appear headed for a slightly higher-than-normal seasonal decline.Bernstein's analysis is based on reports from 10 companies that have both high revenue exposure to Apple and a strong historical correlation with iPhone revenue. Only two of those are traded in the U.S.: Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ASX) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS).On Wednesday, Nomura Instinet lowered its iPhone sales estimates for the March quarter and full fiscal year based on ""soft demand data points and negative revisions in the supply chain.""Nomura lowered its March iPhone estimate by 3 million units to 60 million, compared with the consensus estimate of 62 million. It cut its iPhone estimate for the fiscal year, which ends Sept. 29, by 5 million units to 240 million, in line with consensus. Nomura rates Apple stock as neutral with a price target of 175.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 87 out of a best-possible 99. For more analysis on Apple, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Bernstein and Nomura followed comments from JPMorgan, which said Tuesday that it saw more signs of weakening iPhone X sales and forecast a production cut of 50% in the March quarter vs. the December quarter for Apple's flagship handset.Meanwhile, Canaccord Genuity on Tuesday raised its price target on Apple to 200 from 195 and reiterated its buy rating.""We are modeling the global iPhone replacement rate will increase to 31.3% in calendar 2018 from 26.8% in calendar 2017, as the new iPhone features and improving supply drive a stronger upgrade cycle from Apple's growing installed base,"" Canaccord analyst Michael Walkley said in a report.He sees the iPhone upgrade rate moderating to a ""still strong"" 29% in calendar 2019.RELATED:Apple HomePod Available Feb. 9 After Missing Holiday SeasonApple Sits As Bulls Run; Another OLED Play Falls Below Buy PointApple Stock Hit With Second Downgrade In A WeekApple iPhone X 'End Of Life' Predicted, Production Cuts Seen

1,SWKS,"Apple (AAPL) shares fell in early trading on Monday after Japan's Nikkei reported that the consumer electronics giant has halved its iPhone X production target for the March quarter on disappointing sales.X Apple has notified suppliers that it wants to cut iPhone X production in the current quarter to 20 million units from the expected target of 40 million, Nikkei said in a report Monday. It cited ""slower-than-expected sales in the year-end holiday shopping season in key markets such as Europe, the U.S. and China.""Disappointing sales of the iPhone X were blamed on its high price, starting at $999, and lack of compelling new features, Nikkei said.The iPhone X is the first iPhone to feature an organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, display instead of a liquid crystal display, or LCD. The higher price for the iPhone X was blamed largely on the cost of the OLED display, which is supplied by Samsung Electronics, Nikkei said.The tepid response to the iPhone X may have put a damper on Apple's production plans for new OLED-screen iPhones planned for this fall, the publication said. Apple might shift more production to its LCD smartphones, it said.Nikkei's report is the latest to point to slowing demand for the iPhone X. A number of Apple analysts in recent weeks have cut their iPhone production targets, based on information coming from Apple's Asian supply chain and contract manufacturers.Apple shares dropped 2.1% to close at 167.96 on the stock market today. Apple shares have fallen nearly 7% since reaching an all-time high of 180.10 on Jan. 18.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 81 out of a best-possible 99. For more analysis on Apple, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.On Sunday, Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz lowered his iPhone shipment estimates for the March and June quarters, saying ""it appears the 'super cycle' we all wanted isn't here."" He reiterated his rating of perform, or neutral, on Apple stock.""Without the addition of new, meaningfully large product categories, Apple will enter an extended period of slow growth as the secular smartphone growth era comes to end and shifts to AI-driven devices,"" Uerkwitz said in a report.On Monday, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi lowered his iPhone sales estimates for the March quarter to 53 million from 66 million and below consensus of 62 million.""While we expect Apple to eclipse consensus expectations for the December quarter (fiscal Q1), supply chain data points are widespread and seemingly unequivocal about a slowdown in iPhone units for fiscal Q2,"" Sacconaghi said in a report. He maintained his outperform rating on Apple stock with a price target of 195.The iPhone production cuts could sting Apple component suppliers as well.Oppenheimer on Sunday trimmed its sales and earnings estimates for Apple chip suppliers Broadcom (AVGO), Cirrus Logic (CRUS), Qorvo (QRVO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) for the first two quarters of 2018.Broadcom stock fell 2.1% to 245.47, Cirrus Logic lost 0.3% to 51.22 and Skyworks skidded by 0.3% to 97.10. Qorvo ticked up 0.4% to 68.19.Apple is scheduled to report December-quarter results after the market close on Thursday.RELATED:Apple Seen Lowering Expectations For March QuarterApple Stock Dips On Continuing Concerns Over iPhone X SalesApple Stock Drops On Growing iPhone Sales ConcernsApple Stock Hit With Second Downgrade In A WeekApple iPhone X 'End Of Life' Predicted, Production Cuts Seen

3,SWKS,"The Nasdaq composite rallied solidly Tuesday while the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones industrial average rose slightly in large part because chip-related stocks were big winners. Applied Materials (AMAT) and Cree (CREE) cleared buy points, Intel (INTC) and Micron Technology (MU) hit new highs, and Lam Research (LRCX) announced big shareholder returns. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL), a big buyer of semiconductors, carved a new buy point.X These chip plays, along with several others that are in buy range or setting up, are outperforming the S&P 500 index, as shown by their relative strength lines. The RS line for the iShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX) ETF matched a record high.Some of these breakouts are late-stage bases, such as with Applied Materials. Other stocks are extended, like Micron, while Dow component Intel didn't complete a proper base. But several chip stocks are worth watching.Investors also should watch semiconductors because a healthy chip sector is a positive sign for a market rally. First, chips are a big part of market weightings, especially the Nasdaq. Chips also make up the guts of so many tech products, from the Apple iPhone to PCs to servers and many more. If chip stocks are doing well, that's a good sign for tech stocks and tech demand overall.Apple fell 0.1% to 176.67 in Tuesday's stock market trading. Apple has now completed a high handle, with the top of the handle slightly above the left side of a short, V-shaped cup base. That means that Apple's buy point has actually risen, from 180.20 to 180.71.Apple's RS line, which was lagging badly for several months, rose significantly in February. It's edged lower in the last few sessions, but is still above the high of the left side of the consolidation.Apple fell 0.9% to 175.03 in Wednesday trades.Applied Materials, a chip equipment giant, shot up 4.1% to a record close of 59.99 on Tuesday, clearing a 58.83 double-bottom buy point after trying to break out briefly last week. (You could also view 59.10 as alternative entry from a newly formed handle.)Volume was 36% above normal, but you'd like to see trading that's at least 40% to 50% higher than average on a breakout to confirm strong institutional buying.Applied Materials' RS line is not quite at its late-November peak, but is definitely above where it was at the middle of the ""W"" in the double-bottom base.Applied Materials fell 1% to close at 59.42 Wednesday.Applied Materials is in a fifth-stage base. Fifth-stage bases are more likely to fail and less likely to deliver big gains than early-stage bases.Cree, which makes chips for LED lighting, vaulted 9.7% to 41.76 Tuesday, blasting above a 40.34 buy point in volume that was 372% above normal. The RS line is hitting a new high. Cree cleared a second-stage base.Cree rose 2.7% Wednesday to 42.89.Intel stock rose 1.9% to 50.71 on Tuesday in average volume, reaching a record 51.33 intraday. But the Dow Jones component had not yet consolidated for six weeks, the minimum for a cup base. Intel's stock chart has had a string of bad luck. But the RS line is hitting new highs.Intel rose 1.2% to 51.32 Wednesday.Micron stock jumped 3.3% to 53.74 on Tuesday, its best reading since late 2000. It was the third straight robust gain in above-average volume.Micron cleared a 47.08 double-bottom buy point on Feb. 26 and topped a 49.99 alternative entry on Monday. Shares are now extended from either entry.Micron rose 0.4% to close at 53.97 Wednesday.Lam Research popped 4.65% to 207.94 on Tuesday, making good progress toward a 218.58 double-bottom buy point. Lam's RS line is well off the consolidation's high, but is already at the peak of the ""W"" buy-point zone. Lam's base is fourth stage, however.Lam gained 1.8% to 211.74 Wednesday.The chip equipment maker raised its quarterly dividend by 120% to $1.10 a share on Tuesday. It also added $2 billion to its buyback plan, bringing the total authorization to about $4 billion.Western Digital (WDC), which makes flash memory via its SanDisk acquisition as well as hard drives, rose 4.3% to 93.80 on Tuesday, clearing a 93.41 double-bottom buy point in volume that was 54% above normal. The RS line is lagging though. Western Digital is in a second-stage base.Western Digital gained 1.6% to 95.27 Wednesday.Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), an Apple iPhone supplier, edged up 0.3% to 111.85 on Tuesday, just below a 112.38 cup-with-handle buy point. The RS line is well of its highs, but is at its best levels since late November and above the handle's peak. Skyworks is in a first-stage base.Skyworks lost 0.3% to 111.54. Wednesday.Marvell Technology Group (MRVL) edged up 0.3% to 23.57 on Tuesday. Marvell has now completed a handle in its existing shallow double-bottom base. That slightly lowers the primary buy point, to 24.05, from the prior 24.31. The RS line is not far off highs.Marvell added 0.5% to 23.69 Wednesday.Chip equipment makers ASML (ASML) and Teradyne (TER) need a few more days to form proper cup bases. Their RS lines are already at highs. ASML would be a second-stage base. Teradyne is working on a third-stage pattern.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Stock Futures Dive As Trump Advisor Gary Cohn Resigns Amid Steel Tariff MoveTrump's Globalist Cohn Is Out; Trade War Odds GrowThe Big Picture: Nasdaq, IBD 50 Show Bullish ActionThis China Online Sales Specialist Breaks Out Past Buy Point On Strong EarningsThese 2 Stock Spotlight Names Are Sharply Outperforming The MarketBroadcom Buyout Of Qualcomm Looking Doubtful After Federal Probe

4,SWKS,"Chipmaker Texas Instruments (TXN) received two price-target hikes on its stock Monday, a day before it is set to reveal its December-quarter results.X Jefferies raised its price target on TI to 150 from 111 and reiterated its buy rating on the stock. It also added the stock to its ""franchise pick list."" RBC Capital Markets upped its price target to 127 from 112 and maintained its outperform rating.Texas Instruments shares lost 2.2% to close at 119.44 on the stock market today. TI stock hit an all-time high of 119.98 on Thursday.""We think TXN is uniquely positioned to benefit from multiple secular and cyclical trends,"" Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis said in a report Monday. Those trends include the growth of Internet of Things devices and industrial chips.""We view TXN as a critical supplier of components into IoT devices, which we expect will provide visibility and robust growth over the next 15 years,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: Texas Instruments stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 97 out of a best-possible 99.

TI also is likely to guide for March-quarter results in line or modestly ahead of Wall Street's forecasts, he said.Daryanani sees Texas Instruments benefiting from automotive and industrial markets.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) chip suppliers were pressured Monday by continued reports of an iPhone production slowdown amid softer-than-expected sales.Broadcom (AVGO) fell 1.6% to close at 262.11, on Monday. Cirrus Logic (CRUS) lost 2.2% to finish at 51.60. Qorvo (QRVO) was down 3% to 66.34.

""As we approach earnings for the smartphone RF (radio frequency) component suppliers, a look at stock performance over the last 3-6 months shows that many of these concerns appear priced in.""Mizuho expects iPhone X shipments to fall 40% in the March quarter vs. the December quarter.

5,SWKS,"Disappointing sales of the iPhone X could lead Apple (AAPL) to end production of its flagship handset this summer as it prepares to replace it with a trio of new smartphones in the fall, Wall Street analysts said Friday.X KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted that the iPhone X will reach ""end of life"" in the summer and will not be retained as a lower-cost option when the new iPhones are released. If that is the case, it would mark the first time that Apple has not retained the previous year's model in its smartphone lineup, AppleInsider reported.Instead, the technologies in the iPhone X would be migrated to the 12th-generation handsets, which are likely to be introduced in September.Sales of the iPhone X have been disappointing, leading to a reduction of orders with contract manufacturers, KGI said.Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang also sees Apple discontinuing production of the iPhone X this summer.""Based on our most current research, we believe that Apple may be planning to cut iPhone X production for the June quarter by as much as 10 million units, reducing output to 15 million,"" Zhang said in a note to clients. ""This move drives our latest view that Apple could be planning to stop iPhone X production midyear to ramp up for the various models of the coming Xs.""The iPhone X was billed as Apple's 10th-anniversary handset. Its success or failure is a subject of debate, given its premium pricing and whether it influenced consumers to buy lesser-priced, potentially higher-margin iPhones.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 90 out of a best-possible 99. For more analysis on Apple, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Three new-model iPhones are expected to debut this fall. They include a new 5.8-inch OLED screen handset to replace the current iPhone X, but possibly at a lower selling price of $799 to $999, Zhang said.Apple also reportedly is prepping a 6.5-inch OLED-screen iPhone X Plus, which could be sold at the same price as the current iPhone X, which ranges from $999 to $1,299.Plus, Apple is expected to introduce a 6.1-inch LCD-screen iPhone that could be priced at $650 to address middle-market demand, Zhang said.""The potentially shorter life cycle of the current iPhone X could drive a potentially bigger ramp of the three new iPhone models with 3D sensing"" technology, he said. Zhang rates Apple stock as buy with a price target of 180.Apple shares fell 0.5% to close at 178.46 Friday.The stocks of Apple chip suppliers fell on the news. Broadcom (AVGO) was down 0.7%, near 268, in midday trading. Cirrus Logic (CRUS) was down 2.5%, near 53.40. Qorvo (QRVO) was down 3.4%, near 68.30. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) was down 2.8%, near 99.40.Broadcom gets 15% to 20% of its sales from Apple. Cirrus Logic gets about 80% of its revenue from Apple.

6,SWKS,"Futures for the S&P 500 index edged higher Thursday morning after the major averages rebounded strongly Wednesday.X Apple (AAPL) moved into buy range for the third time in a month after announcing plans to repatriate nearly all of its ""overseas"" cash to the U.S. But volume was just so-so, Apple's relative strength line remains near recent lows, and iPhone chipmakers such as Broadcom (AVGO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) generally continue to struggle.Meanwhile, chip gear maker ASML Holding (ASML) blasted past a buy point on strong earnings, while collaboration software maker Atlassian (TEAM) moved firmly into a buy zone a day ahead of its quarterly report. Both ASML and Altassian moved in strong volume with encouraging gains in their RS lines, signaling the stocks are outperforming the S&P 500 indexS&P 500 futures climbed 0.15% above fair value. Dow futures rose nearly 0.2% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures were a fraction above fair value.Apple announced plans to repatriate nearly all its overseas cash to take advantage of tax reform changes. The Dow industrials component will pay $38 billion in taxes, give a $2,500 bonus to employees, and boost its advanced manufacturing investment fund to $5 billion from $1 billion.Shares of Apple erased intraday losses to rally 1.65% to 179.10 in Wednesday's stock market trading, reclaiming a 176.34 flat-base buy point yet again, following one-day moves over that entry on Dec. 18 and Jan. 12. But the same three problems remain that should make investors wary.Volume: Apple's volume rose 12% above normal, which is actually a little better than the prior two moves into a buy zone. But the volume is well below the minimum 40%-50% above-average increase you'd like to see to reflect institutional buying.Relative strength: Apple's RS line — the blue line in the chart below — is near the bottom of its recent consolidation, and Thursday's move didn't mark a big shift. Apple's 1.65% gain wasn't that much better than the S&P 500's 0.9%. Apple's RS line hasn't made much headway since May.IPhone ecosystem: If Apple's prospects are so strong, then why aren't iPhone chipmakers also breaking out, or at least making moves toward doing so? Broadcom is stuck below its 50-day moving average, while Skyworks Solutions and Qorvo (QRVO) are below their 50-day and 200-day lines. All three have lagging RS lines.Can Apple's low-volume, lagging-RS move into buy zone work? Sure, but the odds of big gains are lower, while the risks of failure are higher.The Dutch chip gear maker tried to clear a 186.47 cup-base entry on Tuesday, but with the market reversing lower ASML settled for a 3% rise to 186.38. On Wednesday, ASML gapped higher on a surprise earnings gain and better-than-expected revenue. Shares blasted past the entry point and traded part of the session in the 5% buy zone before closing up 6.9% to 199.18, slightly extended. Investors should look to see if ASML pulls back into the buy zone or, eventually, to its 50-day moving average for an entry point.ASML roared higher on triple normal volume. The stock's RS line moved above a recent consolidation, providing some confirmation of the bullish price action, while approaching the late-November peak.Another reason to be bullish about ASML: Unlike Apple chipmakers, several chip equipment makers made bullish moves and/or news. Ichor Holdings (ICHR) shot up 20% on strong preliminary revenue figures and bullish sales guidance, skyrocketing back above its 50-day line. After the close, Electro Scientific (ESIO) leapt more than 20% on its own bullish guidance, signaling a move toward a buy point.KLA-Tencor (KLAC) reclaimed a buy point in volume that was so-so: 22% above normal. Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX) rose strongly as they build the right side of bases.Even if none of these stocks looks as good as ASML, industry-group moves are important for even leading stocks.Atlassian, like ASML, also tried to break out on Tuesday, but closed below a 53.55 cup-base entry. On Wednesday, shares popped 3.9% to 54.87 in volume that was 69% above normal. The RS line is above a very short-term high and is making progress on reaching the highs of the left side of the consolidation.But Atlassian reports earnings on Thursday evening, with investors expecting a 33% EPS gain to 12 cents. Buying or holding a stock into earnings can be risky. Investors may want to consider adopting this earnings options strategy.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: 5 Signs Why This Rally May Heat Up In 2018RS Line Flashes Different Signals For These Two BreakoutsChip-Gear Stocks Rock On Upbeat ASML, Ichor Reports

8,SWKS,"Apple (AAPL) hit a record high Tuesday morning, looking at first glance like a market leader after reclaiming a buy point Friday. But Friday's move had some glaring weaknesses and by Tuesday's close Apple retreated to settle just under its entry area again.X Meanwhile, iPhone chipmakers such as Broadcom (AVGO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Qorvo (QRVO), which have been market laggards in the past several weeks, hit key resistance Tuesday. But Qualcomm (QCOM) made a big move.On Tuesday, Apple hit a record high of 179.39, but reversed with the market, closing down 0.5% to 176.19, back below the 176.34 flat-base buy point.Apple rose 1% to 177.09 on Friday, reclaiming the 173.64 entry. That wasn't an especially powerful price gain. Meanwhile, volume was 7% below normal. You want to see trading activity rise at least 40%-50% above average on breakouts and moves into buy zones.Apple's relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is well off recent highs. (The RS line is the blue line in the stock charts below.) Friday's 1% stock move, not much more than the S&P 500's 0.7% advance, did little to change that. You want to see a stock's RS line lead or confirm a breakout or move into a buy area.Apple's RS line hasn't made headway since early May. Even when Apple briefly broke out on Dec. 18, the stock's RS line was off its prior highs.Can Apple's move into buy zone work? If the market continues to power ahead, then there's a good chance that Apple's stock will continue to climb. It's also possible that Apple will begin to outperform the S&P 500 significantly again.Investors should try to focus on stocks that will deliver the strongest gains, while minimizing the risk of losses, especially big losses.Apple reports earnings on Feb. 1.Broadcom is currently in a flat base with a 285.78 buy point. Broadcom sank 0.4% to 263.25 after finding resistance at its 50-day moving average. The RS line has fallen to its lowest levels since early July or early May. That reflects a series of flat bases on top of or next to each other without making much headway.IBD'S TAKE: With the market now in a confirmed rally for 100 days, it can be hard to see who are the true leading stocks and which are in the middle of the pack. See why IBD's relative strength line is so important.Qualcomm is an interesting case for two reasons.First, the wireless chip giant is in a royalties battle with key customer Apple, as well as related legal and regulatory challenges and probes around the world. Those woes helped send the stock crashing from October 2016 to last September.Second, Broadcom is making a now-hostile bid for Qualcomm, so the latter's shares skyrocketed in November. Since peaking in late November, Qualcomm and Broadcom shares have  generally moved in a similar fashion. Then again, so has Skyworks Solutions.But Qualcomm separated from Broadcom on Tuesday, climbing 4.4% to 68.25 as it laid out its case for staying independent, offering bullish 2019 targets.Qualcomm is in a huge cup-with-handle base. If you prefer, you can view the handle as a flat base on its own. Either way, the buy point would be 69.38. Shares closed Friday at 65.38, finding support at its fast-rising 50-day line.Qualcomm's RS line has lagged badly since late Nov. 24, reflecting the stock's underperformance over that time. But the RS did get a nice bounce Tuesday with shares rising and the major averages retreating.Skyworks Solutions is in a consolidation essentially next to two prior patterns that had short-lived breakouts. Skyworks has a 117.75 buy point. Shares closed Friday at 101.21, continuing to trade below its 50-day and 200-day line. The 50-day line last week fell below the 200-day, negative technical action known as a bearish cross.Meanwhile, the RS line peaked in early June and is now just off its lowest levels in a year.Skyworks found resistance at its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, reversing lower to close off 1.3% at 99.86.Qorvo, like Skyworks, is in a consolidation next to a pair of bases with breakouts that soon failed. It's also below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The RS line is right around the lowest levels in a year after peaking last May.Qorvo is in a consolidation with an 81.30 buy point, but has a lot of work to do. Qorvo sank 2.45% to 69.30 on Tuesday, finding resistance at its 200-day line.Analog Devices (ADI) and Integrated Device Technology (IDTI), both seen as iPhone X plays, are both in shallow, short cup bases. The RS lines are lagging, though a powerful stock gain could lift these stocks' RS lines above at least a short-term high from their recent pseudo-handles (they are not proper handles). Keep in mind that the RS lines have basically been flat for a year. Integrated Device's earnings have been spotty.Analog Devices rose 1.2% to 93.10, closing in on a 94.09 entry. Integrated Devices fell 1.7%.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:These 4 Top Tech Stocks With Strong RS Lines Hit Buy PointsA Stock Rises Again After Its First Breakout Fails; Should You Buy Again?Facebook Tumbles Below Buy Point; Why Breakout Was Never 'Meaningful'When Will You Know The Top Stocks' Big Runs Are Over?

10,SWKS,"Apple (AAPL) fought to hold above its 200-day moving average, but by the close had retreated below the key level as the major averages crashed on the stock market today. The 200-day line is a last-ditch support area for growth stocks. Quickly regaining that level would be good news for long-term investors in the iPhone maker.X Apple already plunged more than 6% last week, capped by Friday's 4.3% tumble after the tech titan reported weaker-than-expected iPhone shipments and guided low on current-quarter revenue. Apple, a member of the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones industrial average. That stock has triggered four sell signals in the past two weeks, at least for recent Apple investors.These sell signals were all the more glaring because Apple gave such weak buy signals. The stock cleared a 176.34 buy point in three different periods. The moves were generally modest with unimpressive volume. Also, the relative strength line, which tracks the stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, continued to trend lower.Meanwhile, iPhone-related stocks, including Broadcom (AVGO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Universal Display (OLED) and Applied Materials (AMAT) have shown weak chart action as well. More on those later.Here are the four sell signals for Apple.Apple fell below its 176.34 entry on Jan. 24, sinking 1.6% to 174.22 in its heaviest volume since Nov. 3. The RS line, the blue line in the chart below, fell to the lowest levels of the consolidation. But the stock did find support at its 50-day moving average.The next day, Jan. 25, Apple retreated below its 50-day moving average, again in above-average trade. The 50-day line is the red line in the chart below. That capped a 3.9% weekly decline as the RS line fell to its worst levels since July. Apple shares kept falling for the next few sessions, pushing the RS line to mid-June lows.Just ahead of Apple's Thursday night earnings report, Apple bulls could still talk themselves into believing that expectations of lowered guidance were already priced in. And in after-hours trading Thursday, Apple shares did rally, even hinting at a move back to the 50-day moving average.But on Friday Apple fell 4.3% to 160.50 — 9% below the 176.34 entry. When a stock falls 7%-8% below a buy point, it's an automatic sell for recent investors.Friday's move triggered yet another sell signal, this one for the Oct. 27 breakout from a cup-with-handle base. The stock ran up nearly 12% from that 160.97 buy point and then round-tripped. You never want to see a 10% gain go to zero.So if you bought Apple from the October or January breakouts, there were definite reasons to sell.While not sell signals for Apple, the action of many iPhone-related stocks gave wavering Apple investors additional reasons to take profits or cut losses.Chipmakers with heavy Apple exposure fared even worse than their big customer, falling with other semiconductors in December and continuing to slump in January. Broadcom, Skyworks Solutions and Qorvo (QRVO) hit multi-month lows while their RS lines hit 52-week lows. Broadcom gave bullish preliminary revenue and guidance last week, but the share gains were muted. Qorvo did roar back last week, despite slashing guidance late Wednesday, providing some hope that the bad news was priced in for the Apple ecosystem. But much of Qorvo's gain stemmed from a big new iPhone contract win.Qorvo lost 6.4% on Monday.Applied Materials is a chip-gear giant that also makes equipment for producing OLED screens. OLED screens are used on the iPhone X and other high-end smartphones and displays. Applied Materials came pennies from a cup-with-handle buy point on Jan. 25, but reversed lower. Last Tuesday, shares fell below their 50-day moving average. On Friday, shares slid 4.9%.On Monday, shares sank 4.7%, undercutting their 200-day line.Universal Display, which makes technology for OLED displays, broke out on Jan. 8, though the RS line was lagging somewhat. Shares rose solidly over the next two weeks, but reversed sharply lower after a Jan. 19 peak. On Jan. 23, Universal Display fell below its buy point. On Jan. 24, the day Apple undercut its buy point for the last time, Universal Display tumbled through its 50-day line, dropping as much as 10% below the entry point, making it invalid.Shares have continued to slide, falling 5.9% on Monday. They've erased most of the gains from a short base-on-base buy point initially cleared on Oct. 31.If you bought Apple at the January 2017 breakout from a 118.12 cup-with-handle breakout, you're still sitting on a big gain. There's no glaring sell signal. But the reasons for holding the stock have become less compelling. Since late February, Apple has merely matched the S&P 500 index, with clear underperformance for the past three months.Apple fell to 158 soon after Monday's open, undercutting its 200-day moving average for the first time since July 2016. Shares rebounded as high as 163.88 but then succumbed to the broader market. Shares closed down 2.5% to 156.49 in more than double normal volume.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Stocks Fall Broadly; Is A True Correction Near?IPhone Chip Suppliers Pressured By Apple's Quarterly ReportDid You See The Big Flaws In These IBD 50 Stocks' Charts?Anatomy Of A Chart: Breaking Down The Buy And Sell ZonesIs It Time To Get Into - Or Out Of - The Stock Market?

Home DEpot and Boeing shed 4% apiece.Wells Fargo swept 10% lower, the worst early move among S&P 500 listings, in an early loss triggered by sanctions announced by the Federal Reserve on Friday. Regulators are requiring a shakeup among the bank's board members, and are limiting assets to no higher than end-of-2017 levels until the bank improves management issues linked to account and lending misconduct. The bank has agreed to replace four board members this year, according to the Fed announcement. A statement from Wells Fargo said the Fed's consent order was ""not related to any new matters, but to prior issues where we have already made significant progress.""Monday's gap down move sent Wells Fargo shares sharply below their 10-week moving average.Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) jumped nearly 4% in early action.

Broadcom said it would pay $60 in cash for each Qualcomm share, the remainder in Broadcom shares.  Qualcomm was 3.6% in early trade.

14,SWKS,"Shares of Apple (AAPL) and iPhone chip suppliers fell Tuesday on reports that iPhone X demand is flagging, less than two months after its debut.X JL Warren Capital and Sinolink Securities cut their iPhone shipment forecasts for the calendar first quarter of 2018, citing weak demand for the flagship iPhone X exiting the holiday sales quarter, Bloomberg reported Monday.""After the first wave of demand has been fulfilled, the market now worries that the high price of the iPhone X may weaken demand in the first quarter,"" Sinolink Securities analyst Zhang Bin said in a report. The OLED-screen iPhone X, which starts at $999, hit the market on Nov. 3.In recent weeks, online and retail availability of the iPhone X has been improving, but analysts mostly chalked that up to improving production of the new handset.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 94 out of a best-possible 99.

15,SWKS,"A 0.3% decline for the Nasdaq composite by the close Tuesday didn't look too bad on the surface, but semiconductor stocks got hit with more selling, particularly Apple (AAPL) suppliers, after several analysts expressed concern about flagging demand for the iPhone X.X Apple paid a visit to the 50-day moving average, falling 2.5% to 170.57. Headed into Tuesday, it had been trading tightly near highs, working on a flat base with a 176.34 buy point.The S&P 500 eased 0.1% and the Dow Jones industrial average fell fractionally. The Russell 2000 small-cap index eked out a modest gain. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in lower than Friday's light levels.Chip bellwethers Micron Technology (MU), Applied Materials (AMAT), Skyworks (SWKS) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) lagged badly in the Nasdaq 100, with losses of around 2% or more. The Philadelphia semiconductor index gapped  below the 50-day moving average, falling 1%.In the stock market today, retail stocks were among the bright spots after data from Mastercard said U.S. holiday sales were up 4.9% from last year. E-commerce sales jumped 18%. Heavy-volume gainers  included IBD 50 name Five Below (FIVE), up 3% and Children's Place (PLCE), up nearly 2%.Wal-Mart (WMT) was a top percentage gainer in the Dow, rising 1% to 99.16. It's working on a flat base with a 100.23 buy point.Recent IPO Stitch Fix (FIX) soared to a new high, rising about 18%, after a volatile week last week. Shares slumped nearly 10% Wednesday after the company reported earnings, but analysts quickly came to Stitch Fix's defense.Floor & Decor (FND) added 1% to 45.35 as it works on a cup-with-handle base with a 46.34 buy point.Meanwhile, oil and gas names continued their recent string of outperformance as U.S. crude oil futures for February delivery settled at $59.97 a barrel, up 2.6%. The move was fueled by news of a pipeline blast in Libya as well as comments from Saudi Arabia that said it expects oil revenue to rise 80% by 2023, according to Bloomberg.Oil and gas producer Centennial Resource Development (CDEV) looked poised for its fourth straight gain, rising nearly 3% to 20.68. It's back above the 50-day moving average as it works on a short consolidation with a 22.21 buy point. EOG Resources (EOG), meanwhile, broke out straight up off the bottom from a cup-shaped base with a 108.05 buy point.

16,SWKS,"Investors should follow the action of the major averages and leading stocks. So what did they tell us on Thursday? 1. The dollar is a big market driver, especially for multinationals. 2. Apple (AAPL) and a slew of iPhone-related stocks continue to lag and break key technical levels. 3. Overnight trading is not always confirmed in the next day's regular-session trades.X S&P 500 index futures rose 0.3% vs. fair value in early Friday morning trading. Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.45%.Stocks opened higher in Thursday's market trading in part on overnight comments by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that ""a weaker dollar is good"" for U.S. trade, sending the greenback to a fresh three-year low. But President Trump told CNBC on Thursday afternoon that Mnuchin's comments were taken out of context and he sees the dollar strengthening. That sent the dollar higher, closing little changed. The major averages pulled back on Trump, then steadied at the close along with the currency.A weaker greenback makes U.S. exports more competitive and flatters companies' overseas profits in dollar terms. So shares of U.S. companies with big exposure to foreign markets tend to do better with a falling dollar.Apple's relative weakness has been a steady theme in the evening Stock Market Today column. A day after falling below a recent flat-base buy point in heavy volume, Apple slid 1.8% to 171.11 on mounting concerns over iPhone X demand. The stock closed modestly below its 50-day moving average. Meanwhile, the relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, slumped to its worst level since July. (The RS line is the blue line in the chart below.)That underperformance is magnified by the action of iPhone-related stocks.Broadcom (AVGO) fell below its 200-day moving average for the first time in nearly two years, joining fellow iPhone chipmakers Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO). All three stocks' RS lines are at 52-week lows.Universal Display (OLED), which makes technology used in making OLED screens for high-end phones like the iPhone X and other devices, tumbled 5.7% to 168.25. That's part of a 19% five-day sell-off, plunging Universal Display below a buy point and its 50-day moving average. That follows another failed OLED-related breakout: laser maker Coherent (COHR).There's an old Russian proverb that morning is wiser than the evening. That's certainly something to keep in mind with after-hours action. In the midst of earnings season you'll see dozens of stocks soaring or tumbling after the market close or before the opening bell. Sometimes that carries over to the next regular trading session, but sometimes the action is radically different.There are many reasons why. Extended trading, even when relatively heavy, is thin compared with activity in regular exchange hours. Investors may miss key details initially that are picked up on later. Companies sometimes hold conference calls the next morning or after the opening bell.In late trading Wednesday, Lam Research (LRCX) and Xilinx (XLNX) rallied on earnings and looked set to at least test buy points. But after opening higher, the chip stocks reversed sharply lower, both closing down about 5%.Keep that in mind for Friday's regular session. Industry giant Intel (INTC) rallied in extended trading on its earnings report and sales guidance. That's a hopeful sign for how Intel will trade in normal hours, but no guarantee.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Blue Chips Advance, But Breakouts Sparse After Facebook And Google Breakouts, This Internet Stock May Be Next 3 China Names In Buy Range; Can You Find The Strengths, Flaws?Where To Look For Dominance In The Stock MarketHighflying New Issue Looks To Add To Its Big 2017 Post-IPO GainsIntel Rises Late On Strong Earnings, Guidance

17,SWKS,"Futures for the S&P 500 index were little changed early Wednesday morning after the major averages hit record highs Tuesday. Apple (AAPL) just closed higher on Tuesday as another analyst warned of sluggish or falling iPhone X demand. Apple's relative strength line, which tracks a stock vs. the S&P 500 index, has slumped to a multimonth low.X Meanwhile, stocks influenced by iPhone demand are faring worse, raising another red flag for Apple. Universal Display (OLED) tumbled below a buy point following a failed breakout by fellow OLED play Coherent (COHR). And iPhone chipmakers such as Broadcom (AVGO) and Skyworks (SWKS) continue to trade near recent lows.S&P 500 index futures were essentially flat vs. fair value. Futures for the Dow industrial average rose a fraction. Nasdaq 100 futures sank 0.1%.Apple rose as high as 179.44 in Tuesday's stock market trading, but retreated to close with a 4-cent gain to 177.04 after JPMorgan cited evidence of flagging demand for the iPhone X, the latest bearish analyst prediction for Apple.The stock is still above a recent 176.34 flat-base buy point. But Apple has been sluggish even as the major averages have been surging higher. Apple's RS line is now at the lowest level since the stock's prior breakout on Oct. 27. (The RS line is the blue line in the charts below.) Apple hasn't made much headway vs. the S&P 500 since early May. Investors want to focus on stocks that are truly leading the market.Apple shares fell a fraction in late trading Tuesday.Universal Display makes tech used in creating organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens, used in the iPhone X and a growing number of high-end phones and TVs.The stock cleared a 192.85 buy point on Jan. 8 and rose as high as 209 intraday Friday. But shares have fallen for three straight sessions, tumbling 4.9% to 189.35 on Tuesday in more than double normal volume.Meanwhile, Coherent, which makes lasers used in the OLED production process, skidded 5.4% to 282.59, falling below its 50-day moving average. Coherent jumped on Jan. 17 to close just above a 320.83 buy point, but has sold off since then.When Apple catches a cold, iPhone chipmakers often get sick. Broadcom, Skyworks and Qorvo (QRVO) are all below their 50-day moving averages, with the latter two also below their 200-day lines. Broadcom's RS line is at a nine-month low. The RS lines for Skyworks and Qorvo are at 52-week lows.Texas Instruments (TXN) also supplies some Apple chips, and it's been a highflier, mostly on its prospects in the automotive and Internet of Things markets. But shares tumbled 7% late Tuesday after Texas Instruments failed to beat earnings estimates or lift guidance. That sent several chip stocks lower in after-hours action.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: FANGs Lift Nasdaq To Another High3 Tech Leaders In Buy Range; Skechers Waits For Q4 Shoe To DropAirlines Tumble As United Expansion Signals Price War AheadThis Dow Stock Surges On Strong Earnings, RevenueHow To Invest In The Stock Market Using A Simple Routine

18,SWKS,"Suppliers of radio-frequency chips for Apple (AAPL) iPhones will see their shares under pressure as iPhone X sales expectations start to come down, a Wall Street analyst said Thursday.X ""We remain favorably disposed toward RF (radio frequency) suppliers in 2018 as estimates do not incorporate an iPhone 'supercycle,' but we see stocks languishing near term until we see a wave of estimate cuts for iPhone-related revenue in calendar Q1,"" Cowen analyst Karl Ackerman said in a note to clients.Ackerman lowered his sales and earnings estimates for Broadcom (AVGO), Qorvo (QRVO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS). He also cut his price targets on those stocks.Ackerman also reiterated his outperform rating on Broadcom, but lowered his price target to 315 from 320. While maintaining market perform ratings on Qorvo and Skyworks, he cut his price target on Qorvo to 78 from 80 and on Skyworks to 115 from 120.IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news on chip stocks, visit IBD's news page Chip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News.On the stock market today, Broadcom was down 1% to close at 259.34; Qorvo dropped 3.1% to finish at 65.23; and Skyworks was down 1.9%, to 94.09.Improvements in iPhone X availability lately are as much a factor of weaker-than-expected demand as improved production and supply, Ackerman said.""Lead times have narrowed considerably to a few days vs. initial quotes of 5-6 weeks at time of launch,"" he said. ""Some investors may conclude this relates to better sales momentum for the X, but we are increasingly concerned that demand has been below initial expectations as users appear to have gravitated toward previous iPhone models.""RELATED:Apple iPhone X Supply Improves In Time For ChristmasBroadcom Stock Reverses As Enthusiasm Fades Over Beat-And-Raise Report

20,SWKS,"Stock futures edged higher early Wednesday morning after Democrat Doug Jones won Alabama's special election Tuesday, reducing the GOP's already-narrow Senate majority. Meanwhile, investors are looking ahead to the Federal Reserve's 2018 outlook and an expected interest-rate hike Wednesday afternoon.X Alabama is normally a deep-red state, but accusations of sexual misconduct involving teens hurt Republican Roy Moore.Tuesday's vote will complicate President Trump's agenda by cutting the GOP Senate majority to just 51-49. However, Jones likely won't take office for a few weeks, giving Republicans some time to pass tax cuts with the current 52-48 split.Details of the evolving GOP tax-cut plan appeared after Tuesday's close. Meanwhile, the Fed is virtually assured of raising rates at 2 p.m. ET, but the question is how many hikes that policymakers will forecast for 2018.S&P 500 index futures rose 0.1% vs. fair value after briefly falling following the Alabama election results. Dow and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced about 0.15%.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) is close to carving out a flat base. But Apple chip plays are not faring as well, with Broadcom (AVGO) undercutting its buy point Tuesday, joining Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Applied Materials (AMAT), Analog Devices (ADI) and Qorvo (QRVO) below the 50-day line as chipmakers continue to slump.The GOP tax plan being hashed out between the House and Senate now has a 21% corporate tax cut, down from the current 35%, but up from prior  plans for 20%. There would be a 37% personal income rate and the mortgage interest deduction would  be capped at $750,000, down from the current $1 million but above the House's $500,000.Apple shares fell 0.6% to 171.70 in Tuesday's stock market trading, but they're still holding support slightly above the 50-day moving average.Apple appears to be headed toward a flat base, which needs a minimum of five weeks. That would occur at the end of this week. This hypothetical bullish consolidation, with a potential buy point of 176.34, would be a base-on-base formation above a prior cup-with-handle pattern.Apple is investing $390 million in Finisar (FNSR) to help the optical components maker revamp a Texas plant to make key iPhone chips. Finisar shot up in premarket trading on Wednesday's news.Apple, a member of the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow industrials, has shaken off iPhone X supply concerns.But such worries may be affecting key iPhone-related chip plays, which are also struggling due to general weakness in semiconductors.Broadcom had been one of the stronger Apple chipmakers, holding above its 259.46 buy point for the most part since the late-October breakout, becoming somewhat extended in late November.Broadcom, which is mounting a now-hostile bid for fellow wireless-chip giant Qualcomm (QCOM), reported strong earnings and guidance as well as a big dividend hike last week.Shares popped intraday Dec. 7 on the report, but closed flat. In the last three sessions, shares tested their buy point and 50-day moving average, finally closing below both levels with Tuesday's 0.4% loss to 258.81.Because Broadcom wiped out a 10% gain from its buy point, that entry is now invalid. A strong, high-volume retaking of the 50-day line could present a new buying opportunity.The chip-equipment giant is not a direct Apple supplier, though it's been deemed an iPhone X play for its work with OLED screens.Applied Materials fell 2.2% to 50.47 on Tuesday, continuing to hold below its 50-day moving average.In fact, just one of the 22 largest chip-gear stocks by market cap is current above that key support line, Kulicke & Soffa (KLIC). That's despite the record chip-gear sales in 2017 and 2018 seen by industry group SEMI.Among top chipmakers, Intel (INTC) and Texas Instruments (TXN) are slightly above their 50-day lines, but not many others are, outside of M&A-related plays.Analog Devices successfully broke out in late September/early October, unlike many other Apple suppliers. Shares rose more than 9% above an 85.81 buy point by Nov. 20. But shares then reversed lower on the company's latest earnings report and soon undercut their 50-day line.In recent sessions, Analog Devices has been holding just above or below the 85.81 entry, which is technically still valid. Shares fell 0.4% to 85.48 on Tuesday.Skyworks broke out in late October and Qorvo in early November, with both rising for a few sessions but then quickly tumbling through their buy points and 50-day lines.Skyworks fell 0.5% to 96.47 on Tuesday, about 18% off its high. Qorvo lost 1.3% to 67.70, hitting a four-month low intraday.RELATED:The Big Picture: This Key Tech Sector Shows Unusual Weakness5 Truck Stocks Set Up Buy Points Despite Tesla Semi: Investing Action PlanBullish Chart Patterns: Do You Know The Basics Of A Cup With Handle?Bullish Chart Patterns II: How To Find The Exact Buy Point

46,SWKS,"Apple's (AAPL) recent moves to lower production orders for its current smartphones will negatively impact several major iPhone chip suppliers, Wall Street analysts say.Cowen analyst Karl Ackerman late Monday cut his price targets on iPhone chip suppliers Qorvo (QRVO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS). Meanwhile, Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh reduced his rating on Skyworks to neutral from buy and slashed his price target.Supply chain checks indicate that Apple's newest smartphones haven't been able to spur the same level of demand as the previous year's models, Ackerman said. Apple's 11th-generation smartphones — the iPhone 8 series and iPhone X — represented about 65% of unit demand in the March quarter. That compares with last year's iPhone 7 series, which garnered 83% of overall units in the first quarter of 2017, he said.Ackerman said he is taking a ""more conservative tack on iPhone shipments and content gains"" for Qorvo and Skyworks in the second half of the year as Apple ramps production of its 12th-generation handsets.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Continental Resources (CLR), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Matador Resources (MTDR) all report quarterly results after today's close.Chip stocks were mixed at the open, as the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fought to add a third straight gain. The index surged 1.7% on Tuesday. Cirrus Logic (CRUS) rose almost 3%, and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) advanced 1.2% in early trade.  Cirrus reports its fiscal fourth-quarter results after today's closing bell. Skyworks reports late Thursday. Intel posted one of the heaviest losses among chipmakers, down 1.1% at the start of trade.Milpitas, Calif.-based chipmaker Nanometrics (NANO) spiked 16% after scoring a huge first-quarter sales and profit beat late Tuesday.Juniper Networks surged 8% on strong first-quarter results reported late Tuesday. Terex (TEX) and Ocwen Financial (OCN) each muscled up nearly 5% following their early Wednesday reports.Shutterfly (SFLY) flitted 11% higher after results showed it had trimmed losses more than expected for the first quarter. A 4% revenue gain topped targets. The move marked a breakout past a cup with handle buy point at 84.81. Shutterfly has a weak 45 EPS rating from IBD, but earnings are expected to jump 145% this year, following a 133% EPS gain in 2017.Software developer Zendesk (ZEN) swept ahead more than 95. The Redwood City, Calif., company turned in a strong first-quarter sales and earnings beat, and raised second-quarter guidance above consensus views. Zendesk is projected to post its first annual profit this year, and a 625% EPS gain in 2019. The advance lifted shares just above a 51.01 buy point in a three-weeks-tight pattern.Snapchat parent Snap (SNAP) led the stocks moving lower on earnings news early Wednesday. The 14-month old social media icon dived 21% early action. The Venice, Calif. outfit reported weaker-than-expected revenue growth, and an increase of 4 million daily active users during the quarter fell short of targets for a 7-million-user gain.  Snapchat shares ended Tuesday down 33% from a February high, and 17% below the stock's March 2017 IPO price.RELATED:Mastercard Stock Poised For Breakout After Q1 Earnings Beat Oil Prices Mixed Ahead Of Earnings From These Top Shale Companies Stocks Power Up, And Apple Earnings Add FuelApple Services, Wearables Offset Slowing iPhone Sales Lockheed, Northrop Lead Defense Stock Dive As Sector Woes Continue 2 Very Different Stocks, With A Common Trait, Report Earnings Thursday

58,SWKS,"Chip stocks are hoping for some much-needed good news in the week ahead as earnings season shifts into high gear.The week ahead will bring earnings reports from a bunch of closely watched chip companies, including Texas Instruments (TXN) on Tuesday, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Qualcomm (QCOM) on Wednesday, and Intel (INTC) on Thursday.The sector was knocked down over the past week by cautious reports from chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and semiconductor-equipment supplier Lam Research (LRCX).Investors fret the chip sector has peaked and is starting to enter a down cycle, analysts say.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTaiwan Semi, the world's largest contract chipmaker, added to those concerns on Thursday when it lowered its target for sales growth in the global semiconductor industry this year to 5%, down from its prior outlook for 5% to 7% growth.That day, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 4.3%. It was the biggest one-day drop for the index, known as SOX, since Feb. 8 and only the 10th time in the past eight years when the index fell more than 4%.The iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) fell 1.2% on the stock market today.The broad sell-off in the chip sector was not justified, Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill said in a report Friday. Taiwan Semi said the sales weakness was related mostly to the smartphone sector, particularly Apple (AAPL). The chipmaker said sector growth areas like automotive, Internet of Things and data centers remained strong, Gill said.Lam Research also rattled chip stocks when it gave a disappointing outlook late Tuesday for chip-gear shipments for the rest of the year. Fremont, Calif.-based Lam makes wafer fabrication equipment for the semiconductor industry.Bank of America Merrill Lynch on Friday said chip stocks could go 4% to 7% lower. Rough earnings, trade fights and market volatility have ""soured the mood,"" analyst Vivek Arya said in a report.Arya cut his price targets on chip stocks with heavy exposure to Apple's iPhone business, including Broadcom (AVGO), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS).Chip company earnings in the week ahead could decide if the sector rebounds or continues its downward trajectory.Dallas-based Texas Instruments is set to report first-quarter results after the market close Tuesday. Analysts expect TI to earn $1.11 a share, up 14% year over year. That's on sales of $3.65 billion, up 7%, in the March quarter.Analysts say Santa Clara, Calif.-based AMD should earn 9 cents a share, reversing a year-earlier loss of 4 cents a share. That's on sales of $1.57 billion, up 59%, in its fiscal first quarter.Wall Street expects San Diego-based Qualcomm to earn 70 cents a share, down 48%, on sales of $5.19 billion, down 13%, in its fiscal second quarter.A legal dispute with major customer Apple has dampened its results in recent quarters. Apple refuses to pay technology licensing fees to Qualcomm until the legal matter is resolved.Also weighing on Qualcomm is the possibility that China could block its proposed acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). On Thursday, China's Ministry of Commerce gave a pessimistic preliminary review of the Qualcomm-NXP deal.Analysts see Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel earning 72 cents a share, up 9%, on sales of $15.05 billion, up 2%, in the first quarter.RELATED:Qualcomm To Cut 1,500 Jobs To Help Stave Off Broadcom MergerIntel Stock Nears Buy Point After Price-Target HikeChip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News

59,SWKS,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq 100 were narrowly mixed early Wednesday morning. In Tuesday's regular session, the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones suffered their first declines in seven sessions, falling below their 50-day moving averages. The Nasdaq composite just edged lower — and the big-cap Nasdaq 100 edged higher — as the chip sector rallied. Chip plays Applied Materials (AMAT), Micron Technology (MU), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Marvell Technology (MRVL) are all working bullish base patterns.Skyworks Solutions is a significant Apple (AAPL) chip supplier, while Applied Materials is an indirect iPhone X play.The three main chip groups — Semiconductor Equipment, Semiconductor-Manufacturing and Semiconductor-Fabless — were among Tuesday's very top performers out of the 197 industries that IBD tracks. The data storage group, which includes Micron Technology, also rallied strongly.As for Apple, shares dipped 0.3% to 171.85 on Tuesday, holding above the 50-day line and slightly outperforming the S&P 500 index.S&P 500 futures fell 0.1% vs. fair value while Dow Jones futures sank 0.1%, suggesting a continued pause at the 50-day line at the open for both indexes. Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.25%.At 10 a.m. ET, the National Association of Realtors will release January existing-home sales, though that report likely won't reflect the run-up in interest rates in 2018. At 2 p.m. ET, the Federal Reserve will release minutes from the January policy meeting. Will that discussion suggest the policymakers are leaning toward four rate hikes, or just three?Applied Materials rose 3% to 56.66 in Tuesday's stock market trading. The chip- and display-equipment maker is closing in on a 58.83 double-bottom base. It's a fourth-stage base. Late-stage breakouts are more likely to fail than first- or second-stage bases.The relative strength line, which tracks a stock vs. the S&P 500 index, is still off its November peak. But the RS line, the blue line in the charts below, has rebounded since Feb. 8 as the stock has run up 24% in the past seven sessions, helped by a strong earnings report, dividend hike and stock buyback. The RS line has hit a short-term high, above where it was when the stock made the middle of its W-shaped pattern.Applied Materials' display-making equipment gives it some exposure to the OLED market. OLED screens are used on the Apple iPhone X, other high-end handsets, as well as TVs and other displays.Micron Technology advanced 1.6% to 44.90, continuing to rise from its 50-day moving average. The stock is closing in on a 47.08 double-bottom base buy point. The memory giant is in a third-stage base.Micron's RS line is still low. Look to see if that can rise above the middle of the double-bottom pattern ahead of and during a breakout.Skyworks rose 2.2% to 106.41 hitting its highest level in nearly three months. The stock rebounded off its 200-day moving average, which is trading above the 50-day line, which is not good. Skyworks' RS line has rebounded from a 13-month low and is at a very short-term peak, but is well off its longer-term highs.Marvell Technology climbed 2.3% to 23.20 on Tuesday, rebounding from its 50-day line. You could view Marvell as a shallow double-bottom pattern with a 24.31 buy point. But if you look at Marvell as a regular consolidation, the entry is just one penny more, at 24.32.The RS line is still lagging, but is right at 2018 highs.Marvell will soon close its $6 billion acquisition of Cavium (CAVM).YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Dow, S&P 500 Face Questions At This Key LevelThese 3 Top Stocks Are Nearing Entries Amid New Market UptrendBreakout Watch: IPO Stock With 650% Growth Crafts New Buy PointNew IPO Stock Gets Flurry Of Buy RatingsRoku Earnings, Fed Minutes Headline Investing Action Plan

60,SWKS,"The stock market rally isn't quite dead. The S&P 500, Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 sold off Friday, but all held above their recent lows. But the chip sector, along with key semiconductor stocks Nvidia (NVDA), Applied Materials (AMAT), Texas Instruments (TXN), undercut recent levels Friday, while Micron Technology (MU) wiped out big gains and flashed sell signals.The chip action is worrisome for the stock market rally attempt. It's hard for stocks to have a sustained advance without chips taking part. For one, chips are a big part of the overall market, especially the tech sector. Second, if chip stocks are struggling, that could be a bad sign for demand in the vast array of products that use chips, from the Apple (AAPL) iPhone to a Tesla (TSLA) Model 3.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index tumbled 3.1% on Friday, undercutting its April 2 low. The iShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX) ETF also did so. Notably, the Philly Sox index retreated on Thursday. The major averages rose somewhat that day, but volume was light and the Nasdaq lagged.Nvidia retreated 7.5% last week to a two-month low. But its real problems began March 27, when Nvidia said that it was halting self-driving tests. That also was bad news for Nvidia customer Tesla. That was a bad day for the general market, with the Nasdaq finding resistance at the 50-day line and reversing sharply lower.But there were warning signs earlier that day. Soon after the March 27 open, Applied Materials and fellow chip-gear maker Lam Research (LRCX) reclaimed buy points, but quickly backed off.Last week Applied Materials skidded 5.9% last week to its worst levels since mid-February, approaching its 200-day line. Texas Instruments' relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is at a two-month low. Several other chip stocks undercut recent lows, including Lam Research, Apple chipmaker Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Microchip Technology (MCHP) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMicron Technology was a rare chip stock that was a market leader in recent weeks. Micron had a powerful breakout from late February and rapidly ran up. But the memory-chip giant has sold off 23% from its March 13. On Friday, shares nearly completed a round trip back to the 47.08 double-bottom base buy point. Micron closed below its 50-day line.Micron's sell-off dragged down several other memory plays, including chip-gear makers Applied Materials and Lam.However, iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF, Nvidia and Micron were all up about 1% in premarket trading Monday.Another factors also aren't encouraging. The three-day stock market rally came on increasingly light volume, while Friday's sell-off came on heavier trade. That's classic stock market correction behavior.Some recent breakouts, such as Five Below (FIVE), Vipor Energy Partners (VNOM), fell back below buy points on Friday. Apple and Netflix (NFLX), which reclaimed their 50-day moving averages by Thursday, fell back below those levels on Friday.Despite Friday's big retreat, the put/call ratio came in at a relatively tame 1.04. That fear gauge is below the 1.15 level that often indicates a short-term bottom. The market has several big sell-offs over the past 10 weeks, only to bounce back quickly, sometimes that very day. So even a stock market correction, investors may be complacent.Instead, that lack of investor panic should be one more reason to worry. If nothing else, the recent market swings should underscore the importance of not trying to jump back into stocks before a confirmed rally.As long as the major averages hold above recent lows, the stock market rally attempt is still live. If one or more of the major averages rises strongly in heavier volume on Monday, that could confirm the new uptrend.Stock market futures indicated a solid open Monday.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: The Big Picture: Trump's Trade War Takes Out BullsMicron, Texas Instruments Hit With Sells As Broker Starts CoverageNetflix, 3 Top IPOs Join Stocks Expecting 50%-Plus Earnings Growth If You're Not Following This Sector Leader Closely, You Should Be After Market Sell-Off, These Stocks Added To, Cut From IBD Lists

""If data is the new oil, AI (artificial intelligence) is the combustion engine that will push more silicon into every vertical of the economy.""Semiconductor companies will benefit from consolidation and improved pricing power, he said. But the market is still cyclical and there are caution signs heading into the second half of 2018 and 2019, Arcuri said.""We want to maintain a positive longer-term bias, but pick our spots carefully,"" he said. ""We focus on stock-specific ideas where either estimates are too low or the Street is missing a key transformation.""Arcuri likes Intel because of its data-center chip business and sees Broadcom and Marvell as ""transformation stories.""Arcuri is positive on KLA-Tencor because of its shift from semiconductor production equipment to industrial technology, plus its exposure to the growth of AI computing.The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks currently features seven chip industry players. They include Applied Materials, Lam Research, Micron and Nvidia.Arcuri thinks Applied Materials and Lam will be hit by semiconductor cyclicality.

Wall Street was looking for $372 million.""Unanticipated weakness in smartphone demand that materialized in late December drove our Q3 results below expectations and further impacted our Q4 guidance,"" Cirrus Logic Chief Executive Jason Rhode said in a news release. ""Despite these near-term challenges, our design position remains strong at our top customers and our wide range of new and existing products are expected to drive exciting opportunities in audio and voice applications across the smartphone, digital headset and smart home markets over the next several years.""Apple accounted for 86% of Cirrus Logic revenue in the December quarter.Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill downgraded Cirrus to hold from buy.""When a single customer is 86% of corporate revenues, one can expect quarterly volatility,"" Gill said in a report Tuesday. ""While we don't like downgrading at the bottom we see little in the way of upside until there is more clarity on the stabilization of Apple's iPhone builds and tangential evidence of Cirrus Logic's non-Apple business impacting the model.""Boise, Idaho-based Micron late Monday updated its guidance for its fiscal second quarter ending March 1.The memory-chip maker now expects adjusted earnings per share of $2.70 to $2.75, vs. its prior guidance range of $2.51 to $2.65.

63,SWKS,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average were well off their overnight lows but still pointed to sizable losses at Tuesday's open on the heels of the worst losses in years for the major averages.X The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1,175 points during Monday's stock market trading, its worst point loss ever. The more-relevant percentage loss of 4.6% was not historic, but still the worst since August 2011. The S&P 500 index tumbled 4.1%, also its worst drop in six years, while the Nasdaq composite fell 3.8%. All three indexes drove below their 50-day moving averages.Investors should be extremely cautious about making any buys in the current market environment. If you haven't already, you should consider taking at least partial profits of winners and be quick to cut losses.S&P 500 index futures sank 2% vs. fair value in while Dow futures plunged 2.4%, though both had pointed to 4%+ losses at one point overnight. Nasdaq 100 futures fell 1.5%. Futures were volatile, with big swings.The market's so-called fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), or VIX, rose sharply early Tuesday after skyrocketing Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Don't try to guess where the market is headed next. Read The Big Picture every day to understand the action of the major averages and leading stocks.Asian markets tumbled, with Japan's Nikkei down 4.7%, its worst loss since June 2016. European indexes were down sharply intraday.Keep in mind that overnight trading, for individual stocks or major indexes, does not always translate into how they will act at the market open and close the following day.Meanwhile, Micron Technology (MU) moved on earnings, while a pair of Apple (AAPL) chipmakers — Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) — diverged following their quarterly results.The memory-chip giant earned $2.45 a share, up 666% vs. a year earlier and beating views for $2.22, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue swelled 71% to $6.803 billion vs. views for $6.387 billion. Micron is benefiting from strong demand and pricing for memory.Micron shares rose 1.2% in premarket trading Tuesday. That follows a 3.5% loss to 39.40 Monday to a two-month low. The stock is losing sight of its 50-day moving average.Cirrus Logic reported that third-quarter revenue fell nearly 8% to $482.7 million, well below views for $532 million. Adjusted earnings dropped 15% to $1.59 per share, missing estimates for $1.77. Cirrus Logic also gave weak revenue guidance for the current quarter.Cirrus Logic shares fell 12% in early trading. The stock tumbled 4% Monday to 44.89, its worst level since July 2016.Skyworks earned $2 a share in the fiscal first quarter, up 12% vs. a year earlier, beating the estimate for $1.91.

64,SWKS,"Stocks fell hard Tuesday, then swung into a quick rebound as buyers stepped in to lend chipmakers and other tech stocks a surge of early strength.X The Dow Jones industrial average opened down 2.2%, but showed a 0.3% gain 20 minutes after the open.The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.4% out of the starting gate, then climbed to a 0.4% gain as Apple (AAPL) surged 2% and all of the FANG stock tech leaders reversed early losses into gains.The S&P 500 quickly tightened its opening loss, then rose 0.3%, as chipmakers Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Micron Technology (MU) posted powerful early advances.IBD'S TAKE: Don't try to guess where the market is headed next. Read The Big Picture every day to understand the action of the major averages and leading stocks.The global feedback loop of investor confidence darkened abruptly this week, with last week's late losses in the U.S. reverberating through Asia and Europe on Monday, then slamming back into U.S. stocks as investors also factored in the probability of the Federal Reserve rolling out an accelerated rate hike schedule and news of strict sanctions imposed on one of the largest U.S. banks.The result sent all three major U.S. indexes below support at their 50-day moving averages, and the Dow to a record point loss for the day. The loss Monday was the Dow's  worst one-day percentage decline since August 2011.On Tuesday, Japanese investors kept up the selling as Tokyo's Nikkei 225 plunged 4.7%, its worst single-day performance since November 2016. The index had cut below its 50-day moving average in heavy trade Monday. China's markets also took their licks, as Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index buckled 5.1% in its deepest decline since July 2015. The Shanghai Composite's 3.4% tumble was its widest loss since February 2016.The Hang Seng ended 8.6% below its Jan. 29 peak and still holding a 2.3% gain so far this year. The Nikkei closed 10% below its Jan. 23 record, putting it down 5% year-to-date.In Europe, the leading benchmarks in Paris, Frankfurt and London all remained down more than 2% in afternoon trade.Nothing on the economic calendar, which includes the trade balance and the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey from the Labor Department, is likely to put much of a dent in the day's market action. Given the role of the Fed in current market concerns, investors may pay close attention to an 8:50 a.m. ET speech from St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard.Caterpillar (CAT) rose 2.5%, jumping out to an early lead among Dow Jones stocks. Apple and Chevron (CVX) were also up more than 2%.Among IBD 50 stocks, SVB Financial Group (SIVB) shook off its deep premarket declines and rose 1.5% at the start of trade. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based bank dropped below its 10-week line in a weak-volume, 5% loss Monday.Among China-based names, TAL Education (TAL) and Sina (SINA) also shed their premarket slides and rose 0.6% and 2.5%, respectively. TAL has held up well so far versus the volatile market, keeping above its 10-week line of support and within a three-month base pattern. Sina had pulled back more than 8% below a 119.30 cup-base buy point, tripping the automatic sell rule.Chip names were sharply mixed. Skyworks slugged out a 12% opening gain after reporting better-than-forecast fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue. Q2 guidance was below analysts targets, but management announced a $1 billion share buyback initiative. The early jump hauled shares back above support at both the 10-week and 40-week moving averages.Cirrus Logic (CRUS) sloughed off a steep oremarket advance and gained 0.8%, as at least one analyst lowered the stock's price target following a broad fiscal third-quarter revenue and earnings miss. Cirrus is working on its fourth straight weekly decline, ending Monday at its lowest level since July 2016.Electronic components manufacturer Fabrinet (FN) rallied 24% at the open, after its fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue narrowly topped consensus views, although third-quarter guidance was mixed.A busy after hour reporting session is set to include quarterly results from Walt Disney (DIS), Beazer Homes (BZH), Anadarko Petroleum (APC), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Akamai Technologies (AKAM), among others.RELATED:Stock Futures Point To Sharp Losses At Tuesday's OpenThe Big Picture: Stocks Slaughtered; More Downside Ahead?

65,SWKS,"Stocks recovered from a steep early dive Tuesday and rebounded into the biggest one-day advance of the year for the Dow, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500.Telecom gear makers, homebuilders and data storage names posted many of the best gains of the day. Some of the heaviest losses came from gold miners, solar energy stocks and utilities.The Dow Jones industrial average gained 2.3%, as more than a third of its stocks turned in gained of more than 3%. DowDuPont (DWDP) and Home Depot (HD) led the index, but Apple (AAPL) was the mover and shaker, reversing a brief early decline and ending up 4.2%. The huge-volume move showed solid support at the stock's 40-week moving average.Exxon-Mobil (XOM) posted the Dow's biggest loss of the day, down 1.6%.

67,SWKS,"With a bullish quarterly report and guidance from Apple (AAPL), your stocks to watch this week are five iPhone suppliers or related plays: Broadcom Limited (AVGO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Texas Instruments (TXN), Applied Materials (AMAT), Qorvo (QRVO) and Qualcomm (QCOM).Apple cleared a cup-with-handle buy point of 160.97 on Oct. 27, days ahead of its quarterly report. With Apple up 2.6% to an all-time high Friday, shares are now extended from the 5% buy range.After a wild session Thursday, Broadcom is trading back above a 259.46 buy point initially cleared on Oct. 30. Friday's 5.4% gain puts shares at an all time high, with Broadcom just above the 5% buy range.Broadcom said Thursday morning that October-quarter revenue will be at the higher end of its range. On Friday, shares rallied on Apple's earnings as well as a report that Broadcom may make a bid for wireless chip giant Qualcomm (QCOM), which has been feuding with Apple and many countries around the world over its licensing agreements. Qualcomm leapt 13% to 61.81 Friday, its best level since January.Skyworks Solutions cleared a cup buy point of 110.71 on Oct. 30, and holding within its buy zone. Skyworks, which issues its quarterly results on Monday, seems to be hitting some resistance around the 114 price level.IBD'S TAKE: Apple is on a hot streak. For a look at other high-quality growth stocks at or near buying opportunities, make sure to check out Leaderboard.Applied Materials broke out of a cup-with-handle base with a 47.69 buy point in September, and is now extended 18.6% from that level. When a stock becomes 20% extended from a buy point, that's usually a good time to take at least partial profits.Applied Materials, a chip- and display-equipment maker, is not an Apple supplier. But it should benefit from the use of OLED screens by Apple (in the Phone X) and other top manufacturers.Meanwhile, Texas Instruments is extended 16% from a cup-with-handle buy point of 84.34. The stock has been on a steady climb since clearing that level in heavy volume on Sept. 15.Qorvo tried to clear a 76.57 buy point from a sloppy cup-with-handle base this past week, but never closed above that level. Now, on the heels of earnings and weaker guidance, Qorvo is testing support at the key 50-day moving average.RELATED:Apple Gives Rare Bullish Outlook As iPhone X Hits Stores; Stock At RecordBroadcom Exploring Qualcomm Acquisition: ReportChip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry NewsBullish Chart Patterns: Do You Know The Basics Of A Cup With Handle?

69,SWKS,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow industrials were little changed Tuesday morning, with Exact Sciences (EXAS) and Cognex (CGNX) rallying after hours on earnings. In Monday's regular session, the S&P 500 and other major averages fell modestly even as Apple (AAPL) extended Friday's breakout and iPhone chip suppliers Broadcom (AVGO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) crossed buy points intraday.XS&P 500 futures rose a fraction vs. fair value on yet another busy day for earnings before and after the market close. Dow futures climbed 0.1%. Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.2%.Apple rose 2.25% to 166.72 following a 3.6% spike Friday to clear a 160.74 cup-with-handle buy point. The stock, a member of the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq composite and Dow industrials, hit a record high intraday but is still in buy range. Apple reports fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday and the iPhone X will go on sale on Friday.Those earnings and the iPhone X launch, which will reveal which suppliers are in the latest handset, are key for several chipmakers and other iPhone plays highlighted before Monday's open.Broadcom rose 3.3% to 261.23 on Monday, vaulting above a 259.46 buy point from a flat base. Skyworks surged 3.8% to 112, above a 110.71 entry. Qorvo advanced 3.4% to 76.25 after hitting 76.59 intraday, briefly topping a 76.57 buy point.Broadcom, Skyworks and Qorvo all rose in heavy volume, suggesting institutional support for the breakout attempts.Qorvo reports quarterly earnings late Wednesday, with Skyworks due on Nov. 6.Separately, Qualcomm (QCOM) fell sharply in early trading Tuesday amid reports that Apple is working on developing its own chips to replace Qualcomm's. Apple and Qualcomm are in a bitter legal dispute over Qualcomm royalties.Exact Sciences reported a per-share loss of 23 cents while revenue more than doubled to $72.6 million, both better than expected. The company said it ran 161,000 Cologuard tests in the third quarter. Cologuard is noninvasive DNA screening test for colon cancer.Exact Sciences shares rose 8.2% to 54.20 in early trading Tuesday, which would top Friday's all-time high.Cognex reported 87% earnings per share growth to $1.14, beating the consensus by nine cents, according to Zacks Investment Research.

71,SWKS,"Futures for the S&P 500 index fell modestly Monday morning, pulling back modestly after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite jumped to record highs on Friday.XApple (AAPL) on Friday powered above a buy point, along with several other big-cap techs. Meanwhile, Broadcom (AVGO), Lumentum (LITE), Universal Display (OLED), Qorvo (QRVO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) — all Apple iPhone suppliers or iPhone-related plays — are closing on their own buy points.Apple reports earnings on Nov. 2. Lumentum, Universal Display and Qorvo also have earnings this week. In many of these cases, the Relative Strength lines have lagged somewhat over the last several weeks, reflecting their sideways action while the S&P 500 index advances to new record highs.S&P 500 and Dow futures fell more than 0.2% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures were flat vs. fair value.Apple shot up 3.6% to 163.05 on Friday, breaking out of shallow cup-with-handle base with a 160.97 entry. Along with a generally surging tech sector, Apple also kicked off preorders for the iPhoneX, which quickly sold out due to high demand and thin supplies.Apple is expected to report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.86, up 11%, with revenue rising 9% to $51.17 billion.Wall Street sees EPS rising 11% to $1.86 on sales of $51.17 billion in the September quarter, up 9%. But analysts and investors may be more interested in iPhone 8 demand and iPhone X supplies heading into the holiday season.The iPhone X officially goes on sale on Nov. 3, with prices ranging from $999 to $1,149. Within hours, there will be iPhone X teardowns that reveal which companies have chips and other components in the handset, and whether or not they have a larger or smaller share than in prior iPhone models.When Apple broke out in early August, the lack of iPhone suppliers successfully following suit was notable. Ultimately, Apple retreated below its old 156.75 buy point. While that breakout didn't officially fail, Apple did form a new base next to the old one. So will Apple suppliers follow the iPhone maker this time?IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter. IBD discussed how to use call options for Apple in the latest Earnings Preview column.Broadcom is in a flat base with a buy point of 259.46. The chipmaker tried to break out in late July and late August, but those quickly faltered. On Friday, the stock rose 3.7% to 252.87, rebounding above its 50-day moving average in strong volume.Broadcom won't report its latest earnings for several weeks.Lumentum is a fiber-optic components maker. But it's also a presumed supplier of 3D sensors for the Apple iPhone X. The iPhone X uses 3D sensors for a facial recognition app that unlocks screens.The company reports fiscal first-quarter earnings before the market open on Wednesday, Nov. 1. Analysts predict an 8% per-share profit gain to 53 cents, with sales dipping 1% to $255 million. But investors may be more interested in Lumentum's outlook and the prospects for a big rise in demand related to the Apple iPhone X, even if that's not specifically cited.Lumentum shares are in a cup base with a current potential buy point of 68.73. The stock spiked nearly 12% to 62.60, rebounding from its 50-day line, amid signs that Lumentum may get a big benefit from Apple.Universal Display supplies OLED technology and materials. OLED screens are in the iPhone X and some other high-end smartphones from Samsung and others.Universal Display reports after the market close on Thursday, Nov. 2. Wall Street expects EPS of 12 cents, reversing a year-earlier loss of 3 cents a share. Sales are seen rising 56% to $47.1 million in the September quarter.Universal Display, a member of the IBD 50 index, is in a flat base-on-base with a 145.40 buy point.The current consolidation is just above a double-bottom pattern. Universal Display cleared that 127.88 buy point in early September, moving to 145.30 in a couple of weeks. But then the stock reversed, erasing a near-14% gain and then some. When a stock wipes out a gain of 10% or more from the buy point, the breakout has failed.Skyworks Solutions is an Apple iPhone chipmaker like Broadcom and Qorvo. Skyworks tried to clear a 108.65 cup-with-handle base a couple of times in September, but the stock eventually fell sharply, making that entry invalid.Since then, Skyworks has been consolidating in a flat base, with a conventional buy point of 110.71. Aggressive investors could see 107.92 as an alternative entry. Skyworks rose as high as 108.37 on Friday, closing up 2.3% to 107.91 in above-average volume.Skyworks will report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Nov. 6. Wall Street expects a 19% gain to $1.75 a share, with sales up 17.5% to $981 million.Qorvo will report earnings on Wednesday, Nov. 1, after the market close. Analysts expect a 12% EPS gain to $1.44, with revenue declining for a second straight quarter, down 6% to $811 million.Qorvo is in a cup-with-handle base with a 76.57 buy point. The stock rose 5.4% to 73.72 last week, rebounding over its 10-week line in above-average volume.RELATED:Options Trading: How To Play Apple, Facebook EarningsApple Shows Long Delivery Delays For iPhone X PreordersLumentum Lights Up As AMS Earnings Show Big Gains From AppleTech Favorites To Face Investors, Congress: Investing Action Plan

72,SWKS,"Wall Street analysts continue to trim their iPhone X build forecasts for this year as Apple's (AAPL) contract manufacturers struggle with production issues.XOn Tuesday, Credit Suisse cut its iPhone shipment targets through next year with unit estimates for 2017 and 2018 to 217 million and 233 million, respectively. That's down from the brokerage's May estimate of 223 million and 248 million units. It implies no growth in 2017 and 7% growth in 2018.Credit Suisse attributed the cuts in 2017 to the ""lower-than-estimated ramp of iPhone X build."" Its 2018 iPhone shipment cut reflects the impact of higher-than-expected average selling prices for the new iPhone models, including the iPhone 8 series and iPhone X, which could dampen demand.Credit Suisse analysts Manish Nigam and Camille Xu cut their price targets on Apple contract manufacturers Hon Hai, Pegatron and Wistron, which are traded on the Taiwan Stock Exchange.Apple stock was up a fraction to close at 160.47 on the stock market today.On Monday, Susquehanna Financial Group lowered its iPhone build forecasts for the September and December quarters by several million units because of iPhone X assembly snags.""Our recent checks suggest the main issue with iPhone X assembly is poor manufacturing yields associated with the transmitter and receiver used in 3D sensors,"" Susquehanna analyst Mehdi Hosseini said in a report. ""This has led to a total iPhone X unit shipment forecast of 37 million in second-half 2017 vs. prior expectation of 47 million.""IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has been forming a cup base with a buy point of 165.04 for the past seven weeks. For more analysis of Apple stock, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Susquehanna now expects Apple to ship 23 million iPhone 8 series and iPhone X handsets in the September quarter, vs. its prior expectation of 25 million. For the December quarter, it now predicts 63 million units, vs. the prior target of 65 million.Susquehanna cut its target for total iPhone shipments, which includes older models, to 45 million units in the September quarter and 69 million in the December quarter, vs. earlier targets of 46.5 million and 71 million, respectively.The iPhone X goes on sale Nov. 3 after a week of preorders. It is the first iPhone to use an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display instead of a liquid crystal display (LCD). OLED screens boast richer colors, truer blacks, a faster refresh rate and lower power usage.The push-out in iPhone X shipments could limit or remove the upside to OLED emitter sales for supplier Universal Display (OLED) in the second half of 2017, Hosseini said.However, 2018 looks good for Universal Display as more smartphones adopt OLED displays and production ramps up, Hosseini said. Samsung is rumored to be releasing its OLED-screen Galaxy S9 smartphone early in 2018, while Chinese smartphone vendors also are shifting to OLED screens, he said.Universal Display added 1.1% to close at 136.95.On Monday, KeyBanc Capital Markets said shares of iPhone chip suppliers are likely to be ""range-bound"" until the production issues are worked out.""Until supply constraints ease on the iPhone X, we see limited catalysts for the Apple supply chain,"" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh said in a report.Stocks impacted by the iPhone X include Broadcom (AVGO), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), he said.Broadcom gets about 15% to 20% of its sales from Apple. Cirrus Logic gets about 80% of its revenue from Apple. Skyworks gets roughly 40% of its sales from Apple.Broadcom lost 1.6% to end the regular trading session at 242.62. Cirrus climbed 1.9%, near 54.83, and Skyworks was up a fraction to finish at 107.35.RELATED:Apple Stock Gets An Upgrade On Move To Higher-Margin iPhonesApple iPhone X Deliveries Could Be 2 Months After Preorders

Qualcomm is likely to reject the $70-a-share offer on the basis that it's too low. A deal also would have big antitrust hurdles.

Roku then rose to a record high Friday. Roku ended the third quarter with 16.7 million active users on its content distribution platform, up 48% year over year. Average revenue per user grew 37% year over year to $12.68. Roku makes hardware and software for accessing internet video services like Netflix (NFLX), Hulu and Amazon (AMZN) Prime Video.Analysts tore into Snapchat-owner Snap (SNAP) after a third-quarter earnings report that missed estimates on many metrics, including revenue and user growth. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel acknowledged complaints that Snapchat is ""hard to use"" and said that the app will be redesigned. Shares crashed 16%, even with Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) buying a 12% stake in the social media firm.RELATED:Snap Slammed On Quarterly Results As Tencent Acquires A StakeThree China internet companies, Sina (SINA), Weibo (WB) and Autohome (ATHM), all reported quarterly results that beat expectations.

Shares rose to 13.51 in Thursday's debut and closed Friday at 13.86.

Meanwhile, reports surfaced that 21st Century Fox (FOXA) had held talks to sell the bulk of itself to Disney. Iger refused to address ""press speculation"" on the call. Disney rose solidly more than 6%. 21st Century Fox, which reported solid results, shot up 15.5%.On Monday, oil prices rose to their highest levels since mid-2015 on political unrest in the Middle East.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) on Wednesday topped revenue and earnings views and confirmed guidance for 10% yearly Eylea growth.Priceline Group (PCLN) topped third-quarter estimates but the online travel agency's weak earnings outlook sent shares plunging 13.5% on Tuesday.

78,SWKS,"Stock futures were little changed Monday morning. Broadcom (AVGO) announced a $130 billion unsolicited bid for fellow Apple (AAPL) iPhone supplier Qualcomm (QCOM). Sprint (S) fell after merger talks ended with T-Mobile US (TMUS). And oil prices hovered near two-year highs as investors tried to understand a massive Saudi shake-up.S&P 500 index futures fell 0.1% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 and Dow futures were about flat vs. fair value. The S&P 500, Nasdaq composite and Dow industrials all hit record highs Friday on Apple's strong earnings and the Broadcom-Qualcomm reports. U.S. crude futures rose to just below $56 a barrel while Brent futures were around $62.50.Broadcom offered $130 billion, including $25 billion in assumed debt, for Qualcomm. It offered $70 a share, with $60 in cash. Qualcomm's board reportedly is resistant to the proposal, believing it to undervalue the company.Broadcom rose 5.45% to 273.63 in Friday's stock market trading on the Qualcomm buzz and Apple's lift to iPhone chipmakers. That pushed its shares just past the buy zone from a 259.46 buy point. Qualcomm leapt 12.7% to 61.81 on Friday, its best levels since January.Broadcom rose 0.5% to 275 Monday morning, while Qualcomm rose 3.35% to 63.88.Broadcom would gain Qualcomm's substantial intellectual property, including key technology for 5G wireless servicess.But a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal would carry substantial risks. Qualcomm shares have fallen sharply due to Apple withholding royalties over a licensing dispute. Qualcomm faces legal trouble and official probes around the world over its licensing deals.Meanwhile, Broadcom, a serial deal maker that is in the process of buying Brocade Communications (BRCD) for $5.9 billion, would likely face antitrust scrutiny w itha Qualcomm deal. In an apparent effort to win over U.S. regulators and President Trump, Broadcom said Thursday that it will move its official headquarters from Singapore to the U.S.There's also the question of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), an automotive chip giant but also an Apple and smartphone chip supplier. Qualcomm agreed to buy NXP Semiconductors for $47 billion in 2016, but has been unable to close the deal due to regulatory concerns and investor demands. Broadcom says it wants NXP Semiconductors either way.NXP fell 2.1% to 115.02 on Friday, but is still well above Qualcomm's $110-a-share price. NXP shares fell a fraction Monday morning.Separately, Marvell Technology (MRVL) reportedly is in talks to buy Cavium (CAVM).

79,SWKS,"Futures for the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 rose overnight after Apple (AAPL) reported strong earnings and guided holiday revenue forecasts higher, pushing its market cap to around $900 billion. Meanwhile, four IBD 50 stocks — including the top three of Universal Display (OLED), Stamps.com (STMP) and Arista Networks (ANET) — were active following their own late Thursday earnings reports.XOn Thursday, the major averages closed near session highs. The Dow industrials rose 0.35% while the S&P 500 index closed fractionally higher and the Nasdaq composite ended just below break-even — even with Facebook (FB) falling 2% and Tesla (TSLA) 7% following their third-quarter results. Facebook also is a member of the IBD 50.S&P 500 index futures rose 0.1% against fair value. Dow futures climbed 0.2% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.4%.Apple's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings rose 24% to $2.07, with sales climbing 12% to $52.6 billion, both beating analyst targets. Apple also gave bullish guidance, with the midpoint of its sales target slightly above Wall Street views. That bodes well for iPhone X sales, and thus production, with the high-end handset hitting stores on Friday.For the latest quarter, Apple's iPhone shipments exceeded expectations, services revenue continued to grow strongly and Greater China sales rose for the first time in seven quarters.Apple shares rose 3.1% to 173.38 in early trading, which would be a new high and extended from a 160.97 buy point. Earlier in the extended session, Apple topped a $900 billion market cap, up from Thursday's close of $868 billion.Apple's strong results and guidance lifted several iPhone chipmakers, with Broadcom (AVGO), Skyworks (SWKS) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS) rising early Friday.Universal Display, rated No. 1 in the IBD 50, earned 28 cents a share reversing a year-earlier loss of 3 cents. Revenue leapt 104% to $61.7 million. Both obliterated views for EPS of 9 cents and sales of $47 million.The company sees full-year revenue of $310 million to $320 million vs. analyst views for $300 million. But given its Q3 beat, Universal Display is implying Q4 revenue roughly in line.Universal Display supplies materials and technology for making organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays and lighting. While Universal Display is not an Apple supplier, OLED screens are used in the iPhone X and other high-end handsets, so it's often viewed as an iPhone play.Universal Display rose 3.2% to 149 in early trading. That would push the stock back above a 145.40 buy point, initially cleared on Tuesday.The provider of online postage services earned $2.68 a share excluding items, sprinting past views for $1.91. Revenue climbed 24% to $115.06 million, above views for $1.09.Stamps.com still sees full-year revenue at $435 million-$460 million, but raised its full-year EPS range to $9-$10 from $7.50-$8.50.Yet Stamps.com crashed nearly 9% early Friday to 202. That would be below a 212.75 buy point and its 50-day line, triggering a clear signal.The computing networking gear maker's adjusted Q3 earnings nearly doubled to $1.62 a share while revenue soared 51% to $437.6 million. Both were well above Wall Street forecasts. Arista also gave bullish fourth-quarter revenue guidance.Shares rose 11.5% to 202 in early trading, though that's after tumbling 8.2% on Thursday.Control4 (CTRL), which is in the IBD 50's top 10, earned 35 cents a share, defying forecasts for a flat profit of 26 cents. Revenue grew 17% to $64.74 million, above views for $64 million.Control4 sees Q4 profit of 33-37 cents a share, with revenue of $66.3 million to $68.3 million. Those are in line with views.Control4 is a provider of professionally installed smart-home systems.Shares climbed 4.1% to 28.78 in early trading. Control4 fell 2.7% on Thursday, undercutting its 50-day moving average.RELATED:The Big Picture: These 6 Stocks Hit Buy Zones After EarningsEarnings Surprises Spark Several Breakouts Among New Highs ListApple Beats Earnings, Sales Targets, Guides Sales HigherArista Networks Answers Pre-Earnings Sell-Off With Big BeatStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

81,SWKS,"Futures for the S&P 500 index fell modestly vs. fair value Thursday morning. That follows a wave of reports late Wednesday, including from Facebook (FB) and Tesla (TSLA). Investors already are turning their eyes to Apple (AAPL), a new Federal Reserve chief, and the GOP tax plan on tap for Thursday.Apple's earnings are crucial not only because it's the world's most valuable company, but because its results and guidance will influence a wide array of suppliers and other iPhone-related companies. Apple chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) and OLED technology specialist Universal Display (OLED) closed below buy points on Wednesday.S&P 500 index futures lost 0.2% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures sank 0.2%. Dow futures retreated nearly 0.1%. In addition to Facebook and Tesla, cybersecurity and fiber-optic stocks were notable overnight losers.Facebook earned $1.59 a share, crushing views for $1.28, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue surged 47% to $10.3 billion, ending a four-quarter string of decelerating growth. Facebook also sees slower expense growth going forward.The social media giant routinely beats EPS views, but even by that measure Q3's results were outstanding. Earnings topped the consensus by 24%. In the prior four quarters, Facebook beat by 4%, 11%, 18% and 17%.But Facebook said that revenue growth will slow in 2018, while expenses surge 45%-60%. The social giant plans to double capital spending next year. Facebook will beef up security in the wake of pro-Russia forces exploiting its network, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg said would affect profitability. It also wants to keep expanding video.So shares fell 0.6% early Thursday to 181.60, off modest overnight lows. Facebook closed up 1.4% to 182.66 in Wednesday stock market trading, part of a 7.1%, four-day surge that included Friday's breakout past a 175.59 flat-base buy point.Overnight action often doesn't translate to how a stock will perform in the next trading session.IBD'S TAKE: The latest wave of top stocks flying or crashing following quarterly releases drives home this point: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Tesla lost $2.92 a share adjusted in the third quarter, worse than the $2.45 billion expected. Revenue growth narrowly topped views, but the electric car maker burned through $1.4 billion in cash in Q3. Tesla has $3.53 billion in cash, up from the end of Q2, after raising more capital for the Model 3 ramp up.Tesla now says it'll produce 5,000 Model 3 sedans per week by the end of the first quarter, pushing back from earlier claims that it would reach that level by the end of 2017. Tesla produced just 260 Model 3 cars in Q3, far below the 1,500 that CEO Elon Musk had promised.Musk, on the earnings call, now says ""I don't want to get into the week to week (production rate) stuff.""Tesla tumbled 5.9% to 302 in premarket trading, which would be a six-month low and a plunge through its 200-day moving average. Tesla, which fell 3.15% to 321.08 on Wednesday, has been finding support at its 200-day line recently. It hasn't closed below that level this year.Apple is expected to report fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.87, up 12% vs. a year earlier, as revenue rises 9% to $51.17 billion. But analysts' focus will be on production of the iPhone X, which will be in short supply when it goes on sale starting Friday.Apple shares closed down 1.3% to 166.89, still in range from a 160.97 cup-with-handle buy point cleared last Friday. Apple rose a fraction Thursday morning.But various iPhone plays had more trouble: Universal Display sank 2.6% to 142.70, back below a 145.40 entry after breaking out on Tuesday. Universal Display is not an Apple supplier. But it makes technology and parts used in making OLED screens, which are on the iPhone X. Universal Display reports earnings late Thursday.Chipmaker Broadcom fell 1.75% to 259.29 on Wednesday, finishing just below a 259.46 buy point surpassed on Monday. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), another iPhone chip supplier, sank 2.2% to 111.32, closing above a 110.71 entry after undercutting it intraday.Meanwhile, Qorvo (QRVO), another Apple chipmaker, late Wednesday topped quarterly views but gave weak guidance. Qorvo fell in late trading after retreating 1.8% on Wednesday, failing to close above a buy point once again — despite topping it intraday for a third straight session.President Trump is expected to name Fed Gov. Jay Powell as the next Federal Reserve chairman. He's considered a status quo pick in terms of monetary policy. The Fed left rates unchanged Wednesday, but is expected to raise by a quarter point at its December meeting.Meanwhile, Republicans are expected to release their tax proposal after a one-day delay, but they're struggling to fit their wish list of cuts within a budget framework of $1.5 trillion over 10 years.

82,SWKS,"Futures for the S&P 500 index rose strongly early Wednesday with stocks already at or near record highs. That's despite disappointing sales guidance late Tuesday from several top-rated tech companies, including Electronic Arts (EA).XAlong with Electronic Arts, Paycom (PAYC), FormFactor (FORM) and Check Point Software (CHKP) gave sluggish revenue outlooks, sending their shares lower in late trade. EA, Paycom and FormFactor have Composite Ratings of 97, 98 and 98, respectively out of a best-possible 99. Check Point has a solid 87.Looking to Wednesday's session, Lumentum (LITE) and Qorvo (QRVO), both Apple (AAPL) suppliers, are close to buy points ahead of their earnings Wednesday as well as Apple's results Thursday. Apple is now slightly extended while Broadcom (AVGO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and iPhone X play Universal Display (OLED) are in range after clearing buy points this week.S&P 500 futures rose 0.4% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.5%. Dow futures advanced 0.6%. Key economic data, U.S. auto sales, a Federal Reserve policy meeting decision, as well as earnings from Facebook (FB) and Tesla (TSLA) are on tap today.Lumentum is a fiber-optic components maker. But in recent months it's gotten more attention as a presumed supplier of 3D sensors for the Apple iPhone X.Lumentum reports before Wednesday's market open. Analysts predict an 8% per-share profit gain to 53 cents, with sales dipping 1% to $255 million. But Lumentum's outlook and commentary about 3D sensor demand may be more important.Shares reversed lower to close down 2.5% to 63.17 on Tuesday, but that's after running up nearly 16% from Oct. 20 to Oct. 30. Lumentum has a potential cup-base buy point of 68.73.The chipmaker reports after the market close Wednesday. Analysts expect a 12% EPS gain to $1.44, with revenue declining for a second straight quarter, off 6% to $811 million. Qorvo has a cup-with-handle buy point of 76.57. For a second straight session, Qorvo crossed that entry intraday, but closed below it, falling 0.6% to 75.81 on Tuesday.Even if Lumentum and Qorvo have good results and guidance and stocks acted well, there's still the little issue of Apple's earnings out late Thursday. The iPhone X officially goes on sale Friday, which means there will be teardowns that reveal which Apple suppliers are winners and losers.Meanwhile, Broadcom and Skyworks extended Monday's breakouts, but are still in buy range.Universal Display, which makes key technology for OLED screens, rose 5.7% on Tuesday to 146.50, clearing a 145.40 entry. Universal Display is not a direct Apple supplier, but the iPhone X does use an OLED screen. Samsung Electronics said Tuesday that OLED demand is strong, while initial iPhone X reviews were positive.Universal Display reports earnings on Thursday, Skyworks is out Nov. 6, while Broadcom is several weeks away.Apple rose 1.4% to 169.04 on Tuesday, just beyond the 5% chase zone from a 160.97 entry cleared Friday.RELATED:The Big Picture: Indexes Cap October With Halloween TreatUniversal Display Breaks Out After Samsung Earnings ReportApple Gets Price-Target Hike After Notching Record HighElectronic Arts Guides To Holiday Sales Below Views

83,SWKS,"Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 8 smartphone hasn't been announced yet, but analysts are already picking winners and losers among component suppliers for the rumored device.Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang on Friday predicted that Cypress Semiconductor (CY), Dialog Semiconductor, Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) and Qorvo (QRVO) would be content-gainers in Apple's next-generation handset.Component-share losers in the iPhone 8 likely will include Analog Devices (ADI), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Qualcomm (QCOM), he said.Cypress could gain a USB type-C driver in the handset, Zhang said. Maxim likely has a design win for the power-management chip for the OLED display, he said. Qorvo will gain content, but at a lower gross margin, he said.Qualcomm is likely to be a loser as Apple shifts more to Intel (INTC) wireless chips. Apple and Qualcomm are engaged in a nasty legal battle over wireless-patent royalties and terms.Cirrus Logic is expected to lose power amplifier share to Maxim, Zhang said. And Analog Devices lost the Force Touch component business to a competitor for the OLED iPhone.Apple is expected to introduce the iPhone 8 in September, along with iPhone 7S handsets, which are upgraded versions of the current iPhone 7 devices. The iPhone 8 is likely to be in very short supply initially because of production snags that Apple's contract manufacturers have experienced. Component suppliers have had trouble integrating the fingerprint security sensor into the OLED display, analysts say.The iPhone 8 is expected to be Apple's biggest smartphone redesign since the iPhone 6, which came out in September 2014. The iPhone 8 is rumored to feature a 5.8-inch borderless OLED screen, glass-sandwich design, wireless charging and augmented-reality capability. Apple is expected to replace the physical home button with a virtual on-screen button, which will allow for a larger display.Many Wall Street analysts expect the iPhone 8 — Apple's 11th-generation handset and 10th-anniversary smartphone — to kick off a ""supercycle"" of upgrade purchases among iPhone users.Earlier this month, Pacific Crest Securities identified chipmakers Broadcom (AVGO), Cirrus Logic and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) as three companies likely to benefit from the release of the iPhone 8.Audio-chip maker Cirrus Logic has the highest exposure to Apple of the three companies spotlighted by Pacific Crest. Cirrus gets about 75% of its revenue from Apple.Broadcom is best positioned to make content gains in the iPhone 8 with its radio-frequency, Wi-Fi and wireless-charging chips, Pacific Crest said. Broadcom gets 15% to 20% of its revenue from Apple.Skyworks also is seen making content gains in the new iPhone, Pacific Crest said. Skyworks gets about 40% of its revenue from Apple.On Wednesday, investment bank Cowen said Apple's contract manufacturers might not reach mass production of the iPhone 8 until late October or early November, three months later than usual for the annual iPhone update.

84,SWKS,"Wireless chip maker Qorvo (QRVO) received mixed reviews from Wall Street Thursday after reporting better-than-expected March-quarter results and giving disappointing sales guidance for the June quarter.Qorvo got a couple of stock price-target increases, but also a price-target cut and a rating downgrade after reporting earnings late Wednesday.The Greensboro, N.C.-based company earned 85 cents a share excluding items, down 18% year over year, on sales of $643 million, up 6%, for its fiscal fourth quarter ended April 1. Wall Street was expecting 81 cents and $631.9 million.For the current quarter, Qorvo expects sales to fall 10% from a year ago to $630 million, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Wall Street was modeling for sales of $700.4 million, up a fraction. Qorvo blamed weaker-than-anticipated near-term demand in China for its June-quarter guidance miss.Qorvo shares closed down 1.5% to 67.02 on the stock market today after rising as high as 69.98 and as low as 66.45. The stock is trading above a 64.90 buy point from a Feb. 1 breakout, but has fallen 7.5% from its recent peak and has undercut its 50-day line.Qorvo received price-target hikes from two investment banks on Thursday. Craig Hallum reiterated its buy rating and upped its price target to 78 from 68. Cowen maintained its market perform rating and increased its price target to 74 from 60.Meanwhile, D.A. Davidson downgraded Qorvo stock to neutral. BMO Capital Markets kept its market perform rating and lowered its price target to 63 from 67.Qorvo, a maker of radio-frequency chips, is a major supplier to Apple's (AAPL) iPhone. About 35% of Qorvo's revenue comes from Apple. But Apple's iPhone sales in the March quarter came in slightly lower than expected and its sales guidance lagged.Also, Qorvo lost business recently to rival Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) with customer Huawei, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang said in a report.Another iPhone chip supplier Cirrus Logic (CRUS) late Wednesday reported better-than-expected March quarter results and gave in-line guidance for the current quarter.Austin, Texas-based Cirrus earned 85 cents a share excluding items, up 124% year over year, on sales of $328 million, up 41%, for its fiscal fourth quarter ended March 25. Analysts expected 70 cents and $321 million.Cirrus, a maker of audio and video signal processors, said it expects sales to rise 23% to $320 million in the June quarter, based on the midpoint of its guidance. That roughly matched Wall Street's expectations.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks contains seven chip industry players, including Cirrus Logic and Nvidia.Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland reiterated his positive rating on Cirrus and raised his price target to 75 from 67.Cirrus stock was up 0.1% at 64.49 Thursday. Cirrus is just above a 64.26 buy point after paring losses Wednesday to hold above that entry.Cirrus Logic's results were ""better than feared"" after Apple's weaker-than-expected iPhone unit sales and guidance, Rolland said in a report. Cirrus gets about 75% of its revenue from Apple.""Outside of Apple, we were encouraged by commentary around smart home products and new boosted amplifier wins at Chinese customers,"" Rolland said.RELATED:Apple Trounced In China Smartphone Market By Local RivalsApple's iPhone Sales Miss Hit These Chip Companies HardestChipmaker Inphi Crashes On Poor Outlook, Blames China Inventory Glut

But Skyworks shares fell Friday as investors grew cautious.Skyworks slid 4.3% to 99.74 on the stock market today.Skyworks broke out of a flat base with a buy point of 81.14 on Jan. 20 after reporting its fiscal first-quarter earnings. It climbed as high as 105.34 on Monday. That was its highest level since July 2015.Skyworks, a supplier of chips for Apple's (AAPL) iPhone, got price-target increases from Canaccord Genuity, Craig Hallum, Drexel Hamilton, Mizuho Securities, Needham and Oppenheimer, all of which have buy ratings on the stock.It also received price-target hikes from BMO Capital Markets and Cowen, both of which rate Skyworks stock as market perform.The Woburn, Mass.-based company earned $1.45 per share excluding items, up 16% year over year, on sales of $851.7 million, up 10%, in the March quarter. Analysts expected earnings of $1.40 a share on sales of $840.4 million.For the current quarter, Skyworks expects to earn $1.52 a share, up 23%, on revenue of $890 million, up 18%. Wall Street was modeling for $1.49 and $868 million.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks currently includes seven chip industry stocks, such as Cavium and Cirrus Logic.""Skyworks exceeded financial expectations in the second fiscal quarter of 2017 driven by insatiable demand for high-speed, reliable, always-on connectivity spanning mobile and Internet of Things ecosystems,"" Skyworks Chief Executive Liam Griffin said in a statement. ""We are capitalizing on these powerful macrotrends, pushing the technology envelope and extending our product reach to enable the world's most exciting communications platforms.""Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer reiterated his outperform rating on Skyworks and raised his price target to 120 from 105.""A combination of broad markets growth and share/content gains at Samsung, Apple and China (smartphone manufacturers) more than offset well-documented inventory excess in China handsets,"" he said in a report. ""Management highlighted that China orders are already ticking up.""Skyworks is likely to make content gains in Apple's upcoming iPhone 8, which should boost sales in the second half of 2017, Pacific Crest Securities analyst John Vinh said in a report. He rates Skyworks as overweight, with a price target of 120.RELATED:Qualcomm Warns As Apple Withholds Royalty PaymentsIntel Tumbles On Just-Shy Sales, But These 3 Chip Plays BeatChipmakers Cavium, Monolithic Power Systems Get Price-Target Hikes

88,SWKS,"Apple's (AAPL) fiscal second-quarter iPhone sales miss impacted a number of chipmakers that get a large share of their business from the consumer electronics giant, but some didn't feel the pain as much as others.Chip companies with high exposure to Apple include Cirrus Logic (CRUS), which gets about 75% of sales from Apple; Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), 40% of sales; Qorvo (QRVO), 35%; Broadcom (AVGO), 15%-20%; and Qualcomm (QCOM), 15%-20%, according to Oppenheimer.Some suppliers shrugged off the news. Cirrus Logic was flat, near 64.65, in afternoon trading on the stock market today. Skyworks was up 0.8%, near 101.50. Qualcomm was up 2.4%, near 54.50.But Qorvo was down 0.4%, near 68.10, and Broadcom was down 0.3%, near 224.80.""In the seasonally slow iPhone quarters, we expected a limited reaction in the Apple supply chain, as several component suppliers have already reported results, and most investors are looking ahead to the upcoming fall iPhone supercycle,"" Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer said in a report.RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani concurred. He said Apple's March-quarter results and June-quarter guidance were ""mostly neutral for Apple's supply chain.""IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks contains seven chip industry players, including Cirrus Logic and Nvidia.Even Apple investors appeared nonchalant as the trading day wore on Wednesday. Shares were down roughly 2% at one point but recovered to a meager loss of little more than 0.2% to 147.18 in afternoon deals.Apple late Tuesday said it sold 50.76 million iPhones last quarter, but analysts were expecting 52 million. Unit sales dipped 1% year over year.Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said many consumers are delaying purchases of new iPhones because of speculation about the next-generation model. That handset, the rumored iPhone 8, is expected to be announced in September.Apple's guidance for its fiscal third-quarter implied iPhone sales of 40 million to 42 million units, below Wall Street's estimate of 42.3 million, Schafer said.RELATED:Apple Services, Wearables Growth Offsets Surprise Drop In iPhone SalesSmartphone Sales Pull Back Before Likely iPhone 8 Tsunami

89,SWKS,"Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 were little changed early Friday morning after the major averages staged a modest rebound Thursday following Wednesday's sharp sell-off.Once again, the FANG+ stocks led the way Wednesday. Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) rose about 1.5% in Thursday stock market trading, with Netflix (NFLX) and Facebook (FB) climbing close to 2%. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) was a relative laggard, up 0.9%, but still outperformed the major averages.X Apple's ecosystem also thrived. Apple iPhone chipmakers Broadcom (AVGO) (2.8%), Skyworks (SWKS) (2.6%) and Qorvo (QRVO) (4.15%) had big gains.Futures for the Dow industrials and S&P 500 were virtually flat vs. fair value. So were Nasdaq 100 futures. After Thursday's close Applied Materials (AMAT), Salesforce.com (CRM), Ross Stores (ROST), Gap (GPS) and Autodesk (ADSK) rallied on their earnings reports.In Asian trading, Japan's Nikkei rose 0.1% while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.2% and China's Shanghai composite was fractionally lower.Last week, Amazon celebrated its 20th anniversary as a public company. On Thursday, Facebook had its fifth anniversary. Facebook went public at 38 a share on May 18, 2012. Shares popped to 45 moments after trading began, but closed near the IPO price. Then it spent more than a year below 38. Finally, it broke out in powerful fashion in July 2013. From that 32.61 buy point, Facebook has soared 354% to Thursday's close of 147.94.IBD'S TAKE: Facebook is a standout company and stock. But it's only ranked sixth in IBD's Internet-Content group. To see which stocks are the group's top performers and how they stack up vs. Facebook and objective criteria, check out IBD's Stock Checkup.It seems obvious in hindsight that Facebook would thrive, even when its stock was underwater for 14 months. But it wasn't. Yahoo (YHOO) fell behind to Google in search, and Google couldn't catch up in social media with its ill-fated Google+. Facebook, like many other internet firms, had to deal with a massive shift to mobile, where ads paid out less. That meant Facebook had to spend more to make less.However, Facebook executed brilliantly. As mobile became its dominant form, additional users and ads translated into massive revenue and earnings growth yet again. Its Instagram purchase — a month before its IPO — turned out to be a boon, especially in battling upstart Snapchat, the main unit of recent IPO Snap (SNAP).On its anniversary, Facebook kept busy. Facebook reached a deal Thursday to live-stream 20 Major League Baseball games. It'll stream a game every Friday for the rest of the season, starting on May 19 with the Colorado Rockies vs. the Cincinnati Reds. Facebook already has a pact with Univision to stream some MLS soccer games.Facebook and other streaming sites are making a big push to cover sports. Amazon recently forged a deal to air the NFL's 10 ""Thursday Night Football"" games next season. Amazon is replacing Twitter, which had those rights in the most recent season.Facebook rebounded from its 50-day moving average on Thursday in above-average volume, though trading cooled from Wednesday. It was solid action at a key support level. But with the current market uptrend under pressure, investors should be cautious about stepping in.RELATED:The Big Picture: 3 Technical Signs That Favor The BullsSalesforce.com Beats Profit, Revenue Views, Tweaks Full-Year OutlookApplied Materials Hails 'Tremendous Momentum'; EPS Growth Tops 100% Again

90,SWKS,"Major stock indexes strengthened in late-afternoon trading Thursday after sharp losses Wednesday in higher volume that put the market uptrend under pressure.Outperformers in the Dow Jones industrial average included Wal-Mart (WMT). Shares rose 3% as Wall Street seemed to focus on a 63% jump in e-commerce sales. Dow component Cisco Systems (CSCO), meanwhile, plunged 7% after reporting earnings and issuing tepid guidance.The Nasdaq rose 0.8%, helped by strength in chip stocks like Nvidia (NVDA), Skyworks (SWKS) and Analog Devices (ADI), which showed gains of more than 2%. The S&P 500 and the Dow added 0.6% each. Volume on the NYSE was tracking higher than Wednesday's level. Nasdaq volume was a bit lower.The 10-year Treasury fell another basis point to 2.21%, after plunging 10 basis points Wednesday. The odds for an interest rate hike by the Fed at the June meeting have been fading in recent days.In the stock market today, shares of Facebook (FB) rallied 2%, unfazed by news that it was fined $122 million by the European Union for misleading statements about its 2014 acquisition of messaging service WhatsApp.Alibaba (BABA) reversed higher, rising 0.7%, after falling as much as 5.6% intraday. Investors initially focused on an earnings miss, but other metrics looked good, including a 50% rise in sales. The company also announced a $6 billion share buyback.Elsewhere, Leaderboard name Trade Desk (TTD) recovered nicely after Wednesday's rout. Shares jumped 8% to 51.54. It's extended from a 46.31 buy point.Biotechs were on the move as headlines flowed out of the ASCO cancer conference in Chicago. Incyte (INCY) soared 7% on news that its immuno-oncology drug proved effective along with Merck's (MRK) Keytruda in treating patients with advanced lung cancer. Despite Incyte's impressive move Thursday, it's still below the 50-day moving average, a potential resistance level to watch.Other big gainers in the biotech group included Regeneron (REGN). Shares rose 2% to 456.99. It's in the early stages of clearing a cup-shaped base with a 453.06 buy point.RELATED:Incyte Teams Up With Dow's Merck To Trounce Roche In CancerAlibaba Earnings Miss But Revenue Soars 60%; Shares Falter Nvidia Stock Up On Price-Target Hike; Macom Rated A Buy

94,SWKS,"Noticeably smaller crowds turned out to buy Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 8 on its first day of availability Friday as analysts chalked it up to Apple fans waiting for the company's premium iPhone X smartphone, due in six weeks.XApple shares fell once again, with the stock down more than 5% for the week as of Friday morning.Reuters described the launch of the iPhone 8 as ""muted"" in Australia and Asia, the first markets to start selling the new phone, compared with previous new handsets from the consumer electronics giant. It cited lackluster reviews for the iPhone 8 as a potential reason for the lack of enthusiasm for the device.Reviewers said the iPhone 8-series smartphones are incremental upgrades to the LCD-screen iPhone 7-series phones released a year ago. The iPhone 8 adds wireless charging and boasts improved cameras and other upgraded components, compared with its predecessor.By contrast, the iPhone X, pronounced ""ten"" as in the Roman numeral, sports an OLED screen, facial recognition for secure log-in and a revamped design. Preorders for the iPhone X begin Oct. 27 and the device goes on sale Nov. 3.Apple's Regent Street store in London had more employees than customers when it opened for business on Friday, Mashable reported. The atmosphere was subdued and the queue of customers was underwhelming, the website said.One of the first iPhone 8 phones sold went to iFixit, a company that specializes in do-it-yourself repairs and is known for its ""teardowns"" of consumer devices. It opened the iPhone 8 and documented what it found in terms of components and how it can be repaired.The iFixit teardown analysis of the iPhone 8 innards found the usual suspects when it comes to chip suppliers, including Broadcom (AVGO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS).The iPhone 8 that iFixit inspected also contained several chips from Qualcomm (QCOM), including an LTE modem. Apple and Qualcomm are locked in a bitter legal fight over patent licensing terms and royalty payments. Because of this, Apple is believed to be replacing Qualcomm chips with Intel (INTC) chips in some devices.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 80, meaning it has outperformed 80% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more analysis of Apple, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson on Friday reiterated his overweight rating on Apple stock and raised his price target to 196 from 190.Apple shares dropped just under 1% to close at 151.89 on the stock market today.

""A unifying theme of the iPhone 8 reviews has been that the changes from the 7 to the 8 are incremental.

Skyworks broke out on Sept. 15, but fell back below that entry on Monday as Apple slumped amid concerns that iPhone 8 preorders are lackluster.

99,SWKS,"XFutures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 indicated modest gains at Monday's open following strong market gains last week. Investors will get a key reading on the U.S. economy Monday, with earnings from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) on tap following Friday's selloff in chip stocks.Last week the Nasdaq composite rose 2.3%, its best showing since January, with the tech-heavy index hitting record highs. The S&P 500 index climbed 1.5% and the Dow Jones industrial average 1.9%, both close to all-time levels.Futures for the Dow industrials rose near 0.2% vs. fair value. S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.2%. In overseas trading Monday, Japan's Nikkei rose 0.6% while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 climbed 0.55%. Many major Asian and European markets were closed for the international labor day holiday.Advanced Micro Devices is one of a handful of earnings reports on Monday, ahead of Tuesday, when Apple (AAPL), Mastercard (MA), Papa John's (PZZA), a pair of fiber-optic plays and dozens more release quarterly earnings.AMD is expected to report a 4-cent per-share loss after Monday's market close, narrowing vs. a 12-cent loss a year earlier. Revenue should climb 18% to $984.38 million. For the full year, AMD is expected to turn an 8-cent profit vs. a 14-cent loss a year ago.IBD'S TAKE: All-time winning stocks tend to have Composite Ratings of 95 or more near the start of big price moves. Here are the five ""top 5%"" stocks with earnings due this week.AMD shares have been trying to get above their 50-day moving average, moving above that key support intraday on Thursday and Friday but turning back, falling 2.3% to 13.30 in Friday stock market trading.AMD is working on a double-bottom base. A double-bottom pattern is a ""W""-shaped consolidation in which the second leg of the W undercuts that first. As a result, AMD has a potential buy point at 14.85, jut above the center of the ""W.""AMD's chips are used for PC gaming graphics as well as new AI uses. Its results and guidance may offer clues for rival Nvidia (NVDA), which reports on May 9.AMD and Nvidia have similar-looking chart patterns at first glance. But there is a key difference. In Nvidia's case, the second leg of the ""W"" did not quite undercut the intraday low of the first leg. That means it did not shake out as many weak holders as AMD's true double-bottom. Thus, Nvidia's potential buy point for now is 121.02, just above the old high. Nvidia's stock has moved just above its 50-day line.AMD's report also will key for the chip sector, which has been a leading group but faltered at the end of last week. Intel (INTC), which just missed on sales late Thursday, fell 3.4%. But Apple chip supplier Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and chip-gear maker KLA-Tencor (KLAC) sank 4.3% and 5.2% despite better-than-expected profits and sales.Skyworks dragged down other Apple iPhone chipmakers, including Qorvo (QRVO), which fell 4.3%. Qorvo technically fell back into buy range but the heavy-volume decline to just below the 50-day line raises concerns. Qorvo reports earnings Wednesday.For iPhone chipmakers generally, Apple earnings late Tuesday may be the big mover. Expect another quarter of slim profit and sales growth. Investors are betting on strong demand for the upcoming iPhone 8, and perhaps new buybacks and higher dividends from Apple's huge cash pile.The Institute for Supply Management will release its April manufacturing survey at 10 a.m. ET.

Amazon.com (AMZN) surged to record highs after easily beating the Street's earnings and sales estimates. The earnings beat led to multiple price-target raises from analysts. Shares, which had been up as much as 3.4% in early trading, were fading and only rose 1.8%.Fellow FANG member Alphabet (GOOGL) surged 4.4% after its impressive Q1 earnings and sales beat. As a result, the Google-parent company received a number of price-target hikes from Wall Street analysts.Chip stocks underperformed in the stock market today as disappointing earnings results from chip bellwethers Intel and Qualcomm (QCOM) weighed on the overall sector.Qualcomm continued its downtrend in earnest, falling 2.6% after the chip designer cut its earnings and revenue guidance in the current quarter. Qualcomm and its key customer Apple (AAPL) are embroiled in a legal battle.Leading chip stocks Broadcom (AVGO) and Applied Materials (AMAT) fell over 1% apiece.

102,SWKS,"Pacific Crest Securities pounded the table for Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) on Thursday, saying investors should buy shares in the two chipmakers ahead of their first-quarter earnings reports.Pacific Crest analyst John Vinh said Monolithic and Skyworks are his ""favorite names"" in the semiconductor sector now.San Jose, Calif.-based Monolithic is scheduled to report first-quarter financial results on Wednesday after the market close, while Irvine, Calif.-based Skyworks is set to release its fiscal second-quarter results on April 27 after the close.Pacific Crest has a price target on Monolithic stock of 100. It has a target of 120 on Skyworks stock. Vinh rates both stocks as overweight.Monolithic was up 2.2% to close at 93.81 on the stock market today. Skyworks was up 2.4%, near 101.63.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks includes Monolithic Power Systems and six other chipmakers.Monolithic should benefit from broad-based demand and market-share gains in the first quarter, Vinh said in a report.In the second quarter, Monolithic should get a boost from production of Microsoft's (MSFT) next-generation video game console, called Scorpio, he said.In the second half of 2017, Monolithic is poised to benefit from the production ramp of servers based on Intel's (INTC) Purley chips.Skyworks is making content gains in smartphones from Huawei and Samsung. In the second half of the year, it should be aided by content gains in Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 8 smartphone.RELATED:Qualcomm Price Targets Slashed On Apple Uncertainty

103,SWKS,"XApple's (AAPL) component suppliers are struggling with a new optical fingerprint sensor, which could lead to shortages or a delay in availability for Apple's upcoming iPhone 8 or elimination of fingerprint sensing from the next-generation smartphone.That's the assessment of Pacific Crest Securities analysts in a report to clients on Sunday. The Pacific Crest report follows other reports that say Apple is having problems producing its next handset, raising the possibility that it could miss its usual mid-September release window.""While this creates some risk of production delays, at this point we do not believe it materially threatens volume through the coming iPhone cycle,"" Pacific Crest said.The investment bank reiterated its overweight rating on Apple with a price target of 150.Apple shares rose 0.5% to 141.80 on the stock market today, moving back above a 141.12 follow-on buy point after undercutting that level on Friday.Among Apple supplier stocks, Pacific Crest named Broadcom (AVGO), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) as its favorites.""The anticipated move to a full-screen OLED panel in the coming iPhone 8/X eliminates the physical home button, which necessitates a move to a virtual home button and an optical fingerprint sensing solution to read fingerprints through the OLED panel,"" Pacific Crest said. ""At this point, we do not believe Apple's optical fingerprint module provider has firm orders for production, which suggests Apple does not have functionality of the optical fingerprint sensor ready. Additionally, we believe Apple has evaluated Synaptic's (SYNA) optical fingerprint solution, but that it has not been qualified.""If Apple cuts the fingerprint sensor from the iPhone 8, it would rely on a biometric login that relies exclusively on 3D sensing, Pacific Crest said.""Since fingerprint login is such a widely used feature and 3D sensing is unproven for this purpose, a wholesale elimination of fingerprint sensing in the OLED iPhone would create incremental risk to consumer adoption,"" Pacific Crest said.

104,SWKS,"XFacebook (FB), Apple (AAPL) supplier Qorvo (QRVO), Paycom (PAYC), Impinj (PI) and Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) hail from different industries, but they all share a common trait. They all have Composite Ratings of at least 95 and are reporting earnings this coming week.Many big stock market winners have had 95+ CRs at the start of their big price moves.The Composite Rating, which goes from 1 to a best-possible 99, is an overall score for a stock that combine other proprietary IBD ratings of fundamental and technical factors. You should never buy a stock simply on ratings. But let's take a look of these five stocks, some of which are close to buy ratings.(Apple also is reporting on Tuesday. Apple has an 80 Composite Rating, reflecting its three-quarter string of declining earnings before a slim gain in its prior quarter. Analysts expect another modest rise in Tuesday's report. But the stock has been the top performer on the Dow Jones industrial average, and is still in buy range from a 141.12 three-weeks-tight pattern. Investors are looking ahead to the iPhone 8 later this year to reignite growth. Many also are hoping for Apple to return more of its huge cash hoard.)Facebook, which reports Wednesday, has a 96 Composite Rating.The stock had risen 29% in 2017 as of Friday.Facebook rose 1.5% to 152.46 on the stock market today, hitting a record high for a fifth straight session. The stock is well extended from any proper buy point.The social networking giant seems to have dealt with upstart Snapchat by cloning many of the Snap (SNAP) unit's most popular features, especially via Facebook's Instagram. Instagram recently topped 700 million users.Analysts expect Facebook to report 45% gains in earnings per share and revenue. That would actually represent the third straight quarter of decelerating growth for both, but it's excellent growth for so a large company with such stellar year-earlier comparisons.Qorvo, which reports Wednesday, has a 96 Composite Rating. It makes radio frequency chips used in the Apple iPhone and other wireless devices.Apple cleared a 64.90 buy point in early February, and didn't clear the 5% chase zone until early April. But Qorvo sank 4.35% to 68.03 on Friday, in more than double normal volume. Technically, the stock is just in buy range, but the high-volume selloff to below its 50-day raises some concerns.Qorvo moved back above the 50-day line on Monday, climbing 0.85% to 68.61.Chip stocks had a tough session Friday, with fellow Apple supplier Skyworks (SWKS) tumbling 4.3% despite reporting better-than-expected earnings late Thursday.Paycom, which reports Tuesday, has a best-possible 99 Composite Rating.Paycom makes cloud-based payroll and human resource software, targeting smaller businesses.Paycom cleared a 53.03 buy point on Feb. 17. Shares hit a record high last week, closing Friday at 60.25, extended from that entry area. So there is no proper buy point currently.Paycom rose 0.9% to 60.77 on Monday.Wall Street expects a 24% EPS gain, with a 28.5% revenue rise. That would mark the fourth straight quarter of decelerating growth for both, but would still be solid advances.Impinj, which reports Thursday, has a 96 Composite Rating.Impinj is a radio frequency ID (RFID) chipmaker and an Internet of Things play.The stock came public in July at 14 a share. The stock is working on the right side of a cup base with a 42.01 buy point.Impinj fell 5.2% to 35.53 after tumbling nearly 4% on Friday. But those losses follow 13 straight gains.Impinj is expect to post a 1-cent adjusted loss with revenue of $30.7 million. Both would represent big improvements from a year earlier.Cheesecake Factory, which reports Wednesday, has a 97 Composite Rating.Some restaurant stocks have been doing well, but mostly fast food, fast casual or pizza chains such as McDonald's (MCD), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and Domino's Pizza (DPZ). Cheesecake Factory is a rare sit-down restaurant stock that is performing.Cheesecake Factory's stock retook a 64.51 buy point a week ago. But shares dipped 0.9% to 64.16 on Friday, just below the entry, in below-average volume.Cheesecake Factory stock slid 0.6% to 63.80 Monday.Analysts expect a 7% EPS gain, which would end two quarters of acceleration. Sales should rise 3%, which would be the slowest pace in 13 quarters.RELATED:Which Companies Are Now Outperforming 95% Of All Stocks?Which Stocks Make This List Of The Fastest Growing Companies?Apple, Tesla, Facebook, Fed To Grab Spotlight: Investing Action PlanFacebook Ad Share Gains Touted Before Earnings; Stocks Hit High

105,SWKS,"Apple (AAPL) is unlikely to develop its own radio frequency chips for iPhones, making it less likely Broadcom (AVGO),  Qorvo (QRVO), or Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) could be displaced by the iPhone maker, says a Pacific Crest Securities analyst.While Pacific Crest analyst John Vinh says Apple also is unlikely to develop its own audio chips — a plus for Cirrus Logic (CRUS) — he speculates that Synaptics (SYNA) could be at risk of losing business. San Jose-based Synaptics makes chips that control iPhone displays.Shares in Cirrus Logic, Qorvo, and Skyworks fell on Tuesday after a report that Apple will replace power management devices made by Germany's Dialog Semiconductor with in-house technology, possibly as soon as 2019. That report followed U.K.-based Imagination Technologies' warning to investors Apple that was phasing out its graphics chips in iPhones.""In light of concerns over Imagination Technologies graphics chips and Dialog Semiconductor power management chips being insourced at Apple, we believe the risk of Synaptics being displaced is medium to high, while we see risk of RF suppliers and Cirrus Logic being integrated as medium to low,"" Vinh said in a report. ""We believe the risk that RF semiconductors would be insourced is low, given high technical barriers to entry and protection of intellectual property.""Dialog stock fell 14% on Tuesday in Germany.

The S&P 500 slipped below its 50-day line but pared losses and was trading right at the line. The Nasdaq, which had been down 1%, started bouncing as it touched its 50-day line.Volume was tracking higher across the board. Despite the index declines, advancing stocks led decliners by 9-to-7 on the NYSE and Nasdaq. Indeed, the selling was concentrated in chip stocks, while other technology industry groups were basically flat or even higher.The chip sector was rattled after a report said Apple is dropping Dialog Semiconductor power-management chips and will start using in-house technology. The news shook the stocks of other iPhone suppliers. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) fell 1.6% in double its usual volume; Analog Devices (ADI) slipped 1.8% also in heavy trading.Chip ETFs felt the pain also. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH) and iShares PHLX Seminconductor (SOXX) fell below the 50-day moving average for the first time in more than four months.Gold stocks led as geopolitical tensions in Syria and North Korea sparked safe-haven buying. IBD's gold and silver mining industry group was the day's best performer, up 2.4%.Homebuilders also led, after two small-cap companies in the industry agreed to merge. Colorado-based Century Communities (CCS) and San Jose, Calif.-based  UCP Inc. (UCP) will combine in a deal valued at $336  million, including debt. The combined company will have a backlog of more than $450 million and essentially no overlap in territory. Their land is in California, Colorado, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Washington.Century shares jumped 2.5% in volatile trading that took the stock to a record high. UCP gapped up 22% and climbed back above the 50-day moving average as it forms a new base.The deal gave the up-trending homebuilding industry a boost just as many of its leaders were starting to sag. Toll Bros. (TOL) jumped 3% and Lennar (LEN) 0.3% as both are rising above short-term trend lines. D.R. Horton (DHI) was little changed but continues to shape a cup-with-handle ahead of next week's earnings report.Mortgage companies, a related industry, rose nearly as much as homebuilders, up 1.3%.HealthSouth (HLS) broke out of a long saucer base, crossing above a 43.48 buy point.

117,SWKS,"XNasdaq 100 futures were indicated higher early Friday, fueled by strong earnings late Thursday from Amazon.com (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL). But Intel (INTC) and Microsoft (MSFT) were weighing on Dow Jones industrials futures.

The S&P 500 index and Dow Jones industrial average rose less than 0.1%. Both are within 1% of all-time levels.Dow Jones industrial average futures fell 0.1% while Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.4% vs. fair value.

Investors looked past cautious Q2 revenue guidance, sending shares up 4% in late trading.Amazon finished Thursday's regular session at 918.38, a record close. It has a three-weeks-tight buy point at 923.82, just above the all-time high. A 4% gain at the open would mean the stock is in buy range, but if it moves more than 5% beyond the 923.82 entry, don't chase the stock. Buying an extended stock leaves you vulnerable to shakeouts and big losses.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock heading into earnings offers the chance for big gain — or pain. Here's an earnings options strategy that limits risk but lets you cash in on the upside.Alphabet also rallied 4% in late trade. The Google parent hailed its strong start to 2017, with earnings sprinting past views while revenue growth modestly topped. Alphabet closed Thursday at 891.44, hitting all-time highs but still in range from an 867.10 entry. But if the after-hours action holds true at the open, the stock is likely to be extended.Nasdaq futures would be even higher were it not for Dow components Microsoft and Intel. The one-time Wintel duo topped earnings views, but sales were a little light. Microsoft pared losses late to a fractional decline. But Intel sold off 4%.Semiconductor stocks have been hot, especially chip-equipment makers. But in addition to Intel, Skyworks (SWKS) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) sold off late following their earnings reports.Meanwhile, Starbucks reported in-line earnings, but sales were light, with comparable sales in the Americas weak once again.

118,SWKS,"In a very busy week for news, stocks rallied solidly. Markets worldwide cheered the results of the first round of France's presidential election. Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Dow stock McDonald's (MCD) hit record highs on earnings, while Intel (INTC) and Starbucks (SBUX) tumbled, with hundreds of other companies reporting. President Trump's big tax-cut plan, which had lifted markets in anticipation, didn't move the needle when its outline was finally released.The major market averages jumped Monday and Tuesday after Emmanuel Macron led the first round of voting in the French presidential election, with polls suggesting he will easily defeat nationalist Marine Le Pen in the early May runoff. Stocks largely consolidated gains the rest of the week, though individual stocks and sectors were active amid a flurry of earnings. Internet, chips, restaurants and casinos were leaders, while Baidu (BIDU), Intel and Starbucks showed that even leading groups had losers. But the Nasdaq composite hit record highs during the week, climbing 2.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.9%, while the S&P 500 index was up 1.5%, just below all-time bests.The e-commerce giant said adjusted income rose 38% year over year to $1.48 a share, beating the consensus Q1 estimate of $1.12.

Revenue at Google's ""other"" non-advertising business — which includes its cloud computing unit, Pixel smartphones and the Play store — rose 49%, to $3.01 billion. Mobile advertising growth was a bright spot, although Google's rising traffic-acquisition costs are a concern. TAC refers to what Google pays partner websites to carry ads, or what it pays partners like Apple (AAPL) that generate search traffic. Alphabet shares gapped up 3.8% to a fresh record high Friday.McDonald's first-quarter results beat views, and the burger giant talked up its tech efforts, including expanding delivery, trying out mobile order and pay and its new digitized restaurant layout. Shares jumped to record highs. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) also beat and said it was testing GPS-tracking technology. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) beat as well, and analysts debated its progress following a food-borne illness scare.

Starbucks shares undercut a recent buy point intraday Friday, but closed above that level.Software leader Microsoft (MSFT) delivered earnings per share above views for its fiscal third quarter, but sales came in a tad short. Its sales guidance for the June quarter also was below analyst estimates. Microsoft earned 73 cents a share excluding items, up 18% year over year, on adjusted revenue of $23.56 billion, up 6%, in the March quarter. Analysts expected 70 cents and $23.62 billion.

Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), Mellanox Technologies (MLNX), KLA-Tencor (KLAC) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) were chip plays that retreated. But Cavium (CAVM) and Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) rallied after the chipmakers topped Q1 earnings. Gear makers Teradyne (TER) and Ultra Clean (UCTT) boomed on results.Lockheed Martin (LMT) sees more international demand for its F-35 fighter and missile-defense systems as global tensions heat up and Raytheon (RTN) sees ""significant demand signals"" for its munitions on increasing military operations in Syria. Lockheed's Q1 sales fell short of expectations and it gave weak guidance. Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD) topped on EPS and sales.

Free cash flow soared to $1.63 billion from $527 million. The aerospace giant raised its full year EPS outlook, but the midpoint still fell below analyst views.

Wynn Resorts hit a two-year high, and MGM rose to its best since 2008, with shares in buy range. Sands advanced within a consolidation.Exxon Mobil (XOM) reported mixed first-quarter results but said it had no plans to adjust its capital expenditure guidance as the oil major has identified and captured capital efficiencies. Exxon warned that it still needed to be cautious on the rebalancing of the oil market. Chevron (CVX) swung to a profit in Q1 and revenue beat Wall Street estimates as overall production rose. Management said if oil remains around $50 a barrel then future spending would be near the low end of its capex forecast. U.S. oil prices are modestly below $50 a barrel as Baker Hughes announced the U.S. oil rigs in operation rose for a 15th straight week, foreshadowing further production gains.T-Mobile US (TMUS) topped Q1 earnings estimates and continued its streak of grabbing the most new subscribers among wireless operators.

Ahead of earnings, Caterpillar finally broke a 51-month streak of falling retail sales, with a 1% gain that was driven by construction equipment sales in the Asia-Pacific region. Caterpillar shares soared into a buy zone.Biotechs and drugmakers reported en masse Thursday with AbbVie (ABBV), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) delivering across-the-board beats, pumping their stocks up that day.

Centene (CNC) topped estimates and CEO Michael Neidorff said he expects the Medicaid-heavy insurer to thrive on any reform that can be passed by Congress, noting that ""20 Republican senators come from states that expanded Medicaid.""PulteGroup (PHM) topped earnings estimates, but revenue fell short. Meanwhile, President Trump imposed a 20% tariff on Canadian softwood imports, which could raise construction costs by $1,200 per home. New-home sales rose in March to the second-fastest rate of the current business cycle. Pulte tumbled, but did not outright close below a prior buy point. D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar (LEN) fell below their 50-day lines as well.

140,SWKS,"The S&P 500 index, Nasdaq composite and Dow industrials are all near record highs. So where are the big winners?XApple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) sold off last week to drop below recent buy points, with Apple undercutting its 50-day moving average as well. Nvidia (NVDA) got off to a strong start, but has pared much of its gains. Meanwhile, many ""breakouts"" are like Alibaba (BABA), creeping into buy zones but just stalling or pulling back. All of that suggests that the risk-reward for investors isn't great.Using pattern recognition via IBD's Marketsmith, as of Friday there were 75 recent breakouts of stocks trading at least $15 million worth of shares a day, with current Composite Ratings of 90 or better. That doesn't include every breakout: Apple's Composite Rating was above 90 until its recent sell-off. Tesla now has a 77 CR, though that's in part due to a lack of profits. Citigroup (C) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) have decent but not great fundamental and technical readings. But still, this is a fairly large list to study.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, pay attention to the major averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases.Of those 75 recent breakouts, just 14 were more than 5% past the entry point as of Friday's closing bell, making them extended. Most are just out of range. The biggest winner is RV and towables maker Winnebago (WGO), with a 13.7% advance through Friday, taking on a further gain Monday morning. There are several auto parts firms in the mix. A few chip gear makers are the only tech representatives.Meanwhile, dozens are like Alibaba, SAP (SAP), Square (SQ), Amgen (AMGN) — nudging out to buy zones, stalling out and sometimes briefly undercutting their entry areas. Alibaba and Square fell in Monday morning trading to below its ascending base buy point.Some of these breakouts have come in light or lackluster volume, suggesting a lack of institutional support. Unless you bought right at or just above buy point, there's good chance you're down.Boeing (BA) and chipmaker Texas Instruments (TXN) are Sept. 15 breakouts that have advanced to near the high end of their 5% buy zones. Maybe Boeing and TI are on their way to be big gains.On the other hand, some stocks such as Nvidia and Universal Display (OLED), have made big initial moves but then pulled back.Nvidia broke out on Sept. 15. In the next session, the graphics and AI chipmaker rose as high as 9.5% above the buy point. But shares have fallen for the past four days, and are now just 2.5% over the entry.Universal Display, a maker of parts and tech for OLED screens as those next-generation displays are being used in high-end TVs, Samsung handsets and the upcoming Apple iPhone X, was 13.6% above its double-bottom entry Tuesday intraday. But thanks to three days of selling, Universal Display is now just 3.8% over the buy point. You don't want to see a 10%-plus winner roundtrip to the buy point.Nvidia and Universal Display fell more than 2% shortly in Monday morning trade, with both stocks undercutting their recent buy points.Meanwhile, 17 of the 75 recent breakouts were below their buy points as of Friday. Some are just below their entries. But Proofpoint (PFPT), MGM Resorts (MGM) and Apple iPhone chipmaker Skyworks (SWKS) fell so far that those buy points are now invalid.Because of the current 90+ Composite Rating screen, the number of underwater or failed breakouts may be higher. Apple and Tesla are definitely below their buy points but technically not quite failed breakouts, though Apple's above-average volume tumble through its 10-week line gave an additional reason for investors to cut losses. Apple fell 0.8% Monday morning while Tesla rose 0.5%.Oracle (ORCL), with its heavy-volume plunge below its buy point and 50-day line after issuing weak guidance, is a failed breakout.If the market picks up, with even a modest uptrend, you might see stocks that are hovering at or above buy points take off. On the other hand, a market slide, even modest, would likely push many more breakouts underwater.Investors need to recognize the current landscape, despite the market direction being ""confirmed uptrend.""

143,SWKS,"Let the Fed's Great Unwinding begin. Tech stocks teetered on Wednesday, even before the Federal Reserve announced its latest thinking on interest rates and how it would reduce its massive piles of government debt and mortgage-backed securities, but the rest of the market didn't totter. Key indexes shaved their modest losses by day's end, while a few sector indexes scored…

144,SWKS,"Futures for the S&P 500 index and other U.S. indexes tumbled Tuesday morning as global markets were rattled following North Korea's overnight launch of a ballistic missile that crossed over northern Japan before crashing into the ocean. It was the latest in a series of provocations from the rogue nuclear-armed nation.XJapan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe decried the ""grave"" threat while South Korea President Moon Jae-in ordered his military to show that it can ""overwhelm"" North Korea in the event of an attack.President Trump, who earlier this month vowed ""fire and fury"" for North Korea, has not responded directly yet.S&P 500 futures retreated 0.6% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.8%. Dow Jones industrial futures slid 0.5% vs. fair value, or more than over 100 points against fair value.South Korea's Kospi fell 0.2% Tuesday, well off session lows. Japan's Nikkei slid 0.45%. Major European indexes fell more than 1% intraday.Gold prices, already moving to 2017 highs on Monday, rose 0.9% with global tensions and a falling dollar.In the current choppy market, it's key to follow proper buy and sell rules. Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL) supplier Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), leading gold ETF SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), and Biogen (BIIB) all show the importance of waiting on proper buy points before taking a new position.Tesla dipped below its 50-day moving average on Monday. Skyworks drifted further below that support area as iPhone chipmakers failed to rally with Apple. On the upside, GLD broke out into a buy zone, and kept rising overnight. Biogen, meanwhile, approached an entry point.The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index closed Monday higher. The Nasdaq moved back above its 50-day moving average while the S&P 500 index finished just below that level.As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important. Why not buy before a stock surges out of a base? If it rallies, you get a bigger gain, right? But as an investor you shouldn't try to seek the biggest possible gain, but to maximize the odds of a big gain while minimizing losses.A buy point is the price level at which a stock is most likely to begin a significant advance. It's an area of the chart that offers the least amount of resistance to price progress.If a stock clears a buy point and then reverses below that level, that is not good technical action. Because it's clearly negative, it's easier to cut losses short. You may have an opportunity later to buy the stock again if it makes a new move into buy territory.In contrast, if you buy within a consolidation or when a stock is extended or in a downtrend, it can fall significantly over a few days or weeks without necessarily triggering any major changes in the chart. So you can either be shaken out of ""normal"" stock action or find yourself saddled with big capital losses.Tesla shares fell 0.7% to 345.66 in Monday's stock market trading, dipping just below their 50-day moving average. Tesla is in a cup-with-handle base with a 370.10 buy point. If you cheated and bought the stock on the Aug. 16 peak of 366.50, you'd be sitting on a near-6% loss.Tesla shares fell 1.8% to 339.40 in premarket trading Tuesday.Skyworks, which already was below its 50-day line, dipped 1.3% to 100.70, falling intraday to a new low for its handle. Skyworks' potential entry is all the way at 108.65.Skyworks stock is not alone. Fellow Apple chip stock Broadcom (AVGO) is below its 50-day line, while Texas Instruments (TXN) and Analog Devices (ADI) are just above that support level. Despite Apple's continued rise — shares rose 1% to 161.47 on Monday, still in range from a 156.75 entry — we haven't seen a wave of breakouts from key suppliers.Skyworks was not yet active in premarket action, while Apple fell modestly.SPDR Gold Shares, or GLD, rose 1.6% to 124.69, clearing a 123.41 buy point in strong volume. GLD largely tracks gold, which topped $1.300 an ounce and hit an 11-month high. GLD had just topped a prior buy point on June 6, but failed  to close above that level. GLD, and gold prices, then sold off for the next month before making a new move higher.GLD rose 0.65% to 125.50 in early trading as North Korea's missile launch pushed more investors into gold.Biogen rose 2.5% to 292.30 on Monday, closing in on a 297.05 buy point. Biogen announced positive trial data on an experimental Alzheimer's drug early Monday.Biogen's stock rose to 296.91 on Aug. 16, but didn't top the entry. Shares then retreated toward the 10-week line. Biogen's latest move is encouraging, but not definitive.Biogen was little changed Tuesday morning.Watching breakouts overall can give you a strong indication of the market's health. If a number of top-rated stocks are breaking out and continuing to advance, that's clearly bullish. But if breakouts fail or stall, that's a reason to be cautious or move to the sidelines.RELATED:The Big Picture: Nasdaq Fights For Support; This Sector RalliesChart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real Opportunity5 Chip Stocks Set Up Bases; Best Buy Due: Investing Action PlanBiogen's Alzheimer's Drug Shows Promise, Stock Nears Buy PointThese 4 Chip Stocks Just Carved This 'Super Growth' PatternETFs: Gold Soars, Biotechs Rally

145,SWKS,"Amid a grinding-higher market, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Biogen (BIIB), Electronic Arts (EA), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN) are highly rated big-cap stocks holding in buy zones after breaking out several days or weeks ago.XIdeally, stocks will blast out of bases and then rapidly add to gains, and there are some breakouts like that. But in the current market environment many stocks just edge past entry points, with shares soon pulling back below them, at least temporarily. Apple chipmaker Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and chip-gear maker Teradyne (TER) both fell back below entry areas on Monday after breaking out Friday. While their breakouts aren't failures, their high-volume retreats aren't encouraging.Apple broke out of a flat base with a 156.75 buy point on Aug. 2, the day after reporting strong earnings and guidance. The iPhone giant did dip below that entry point a few times over the next few weeks, but since Aug. 21 the stock has stayed in a buy zone.Apple has trended lower since unveiling its new iPhones, with the high-end iPhone X not set for release until Nov. 2. Shares fell 0.8% to 158.67 in Monday stock market trading. One report said that iPhone 8 preorders appear so-so, perhaps as buyers hold off for the X model.Apple's 50-day moving average could offer further support as that key line has risen to about the entry level.Microsoft has been grinding higher in 2017, modestly outpacing the S&P 500 index. Microsoft has been breaking out, then pulling back below the entry area before finally moving higher, sometimes after forming a new consolidation.Microsoft cleared a base-on-base formation with a 74.52 entry back on Aug. 31. True to form, Microsoft pulled back the following day and didn't hold above the entry until Sept. 11. Shares hit a record-high 75.97 intraday Monday, but reversed to close down 0.2% at 75.16.Biogen soared 4.2% on Aug. 30, blowing past a 312.50 buy point from a 13-month consolidation. Shares continued to advance, becoming slightly extended at times but only closing above the 5% chase zone on Sept. 12. Since then, Biogen has retreated for the past four sessions, sliding nearly 1% on Monday to 318.18, still comfortably in a buy zone.Celgene just edged past a 139.10 buy point on Sept. 1, though that capped a huge 7.5% weekly gain as Celgene rallied on investor optimism for drugmakers with ties to CAR-T immuno-oncology treatments. Aside from an intraday drop on the next session, Sept. 5, Celgene has basically held in a buy range, slowly trending higher. Celgene rose 0.6% to 142.84 on Monday, setting a record 143.40 intraday.The video game publisher cleared a 116.14 buy point on July 26, just before the Nasdaq hit a short-term high. Electronics Arts tested that entry point several times, closing below it on Aug. 10-11. But since then EA has generally stayed within the 5% buy zone. Shares edged up 0.45% to 119.96 on Monday.EA's 50-day line has risen to just above the entry level, offering a possible backstop for the stock.Alexion, the last of three biotechs highlighted here, sold off from July 2015 to May 2017. But since then the stock has rebounded. On Sept. 1, shares cleared a 142.57 first-stage-base buy point. A week later, Alexion closed just below that entry, but hasn't done that since.Alexion will cut 20% of staff, the biotech said last week, to spend more on research.Alexion fell 2.1% to 143.64 on Monday.The casino giant rose strongly past a 139.77 flat-base buy point on Sept. 1. Since then shares have stayed in the buy zone, aside from flirting with becoming extended. Wynn Resorts rose 0.4% to 143.84 on Monday. Fellow Macau-centric casinos Melco Resorts (MLCO) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) have formed cup bases, with Melco just carving out a handle on Monday.Just because these seven stocks have generally held in a buy zone doesn't mean they'll stay that way. Some may begin to move sharply higher while others falter. As an investor, you want to keep a close eye on your holdings as well as the leading stocks generally and major market averages.RELATED:The Big Picture: Is This Market Pattern Set To Repeat Itself?Apple iPhone 8 Demand Isn't Looking So Hot, Signs ShowThis Defense Giant Just Broke Out; These 2 Rivals Are Near BuysCitigroup Breaks Out; These 4 Other Banking Giants Are Near BuysBiotech And Pharma Industry NewsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

146,SWKS,"Stock futures rose modestly Monday morning vs. fair value, suggesting continued momentum heading into this week's Federal Reserve policy meeting after the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow industrials all hit record highs on Friday.XApple (AAPL) broke out to a buy point in early August, but key iPhone chip suppliers struggled to break out. On Friday, Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Texas Instruments (TXN) surged past entry points. Keep a close eye on fellow Broadcom (AVGO), Qorvo (QRVO) and Applied Materials (AMAT), as well as giant Intel (INTC), which are approaching buy zones.Meanwhile, Northrop Grumman (NOC) reached a $9.2 billion deal to buy aerospace and defense firm Orbital ATK (OA).Looking ahead, the Federal Reserve will hold a policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, with wide expectations that the central bank will begin to pare its massive balance sheet. Treasury yields have rebounded from 2017 lows in the past few weeks, with several bank stocks nearing buy points.S&P 500 futures rose 0.2% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures also advanced 0.2% Dow futures climbed 0.25%.Asian markets rallied Monday as North Korean tensions receded, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng up 1.3%. European bourses rose modestly intraday.Several chip stocks broke out in Friday stock market trading, including a pair of iPhone chip stocks clearing cup-with-handle buy points in strong volume. That's notable because Apple suppliers had been building sound bases, sometimes flirting with buys, but not really joining their key customer in the buy zone. That raised some doubts about Apple's own breakout, especially with the stock moving sideways for several weeks.Skyworks, which briefly topped a 108.65 buy point intraday on Sept. 5, advanced 2.3% to close at 109.55. Texas Instruments rose 1.8% to 84.78, above an 84.34 entry and hitting a 17-year high.Are these just brief forays into buy zones or the start of a broad advance? One sign will be whether other iPhone chip plays follow suit.Broadcom briefly topped a buy point in late July but then reversed, falling sufficiently to make the old entry point invalid. Broadcom has since formed a new flat base with a 258.59 buy point. Broadcom tested that entry point late last month as the flat base was forming, but didn't close above it. Shares climbed 1.5% on Friday to 250.55, moving back above it 50-day moving average.Qorvo is in a cup base, and just completed a handle, giving it a lower entry point of 75.81. Qorvo jumped 2.7% to 75.49 on Friday, just below that entry.Applied Materials is a chip- and design-equipment giant. It's not a direct iPhone supplier. But some analysts have pegged it as an iPhone play, citing its OLED-related operations. The Apple iPhone X will boast an OLED screen, which is already being used by Samsung on some handsets.Applied Materials tried to break out of a cup-with-handle base on Friday, rising to just hit the 47.69 buy point. But shares pulled back, closing up 0.2% at 47.14.Intel has become a recent supplier of iPhone chips, though you wouldn't want to call the world's largest semiconductor maker an ""Apple play."" But you can say that Intel is near a buy point. Intel surged 5% last week to 36.96, just 2% below a 37.60 double-bottom base. Intel's Relative Strength line has been lagging in 2017 and really for the last several years, reflecting the stock's underperformance vs. the S&P 500 index.For its part Apple rose 1% to 159.88 on Friday, finding support near its 10-week line. That snapped a three-day mild decline following mild disappointment over the late release date for iPhone X. Apple remains in range from a 156.75 flat-base entry.Apple iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus preorders began on Friday. While the tech giant may not indicate how those orders went, big wireless operators, electronics retailers and analysts may give their own estimates of demand. The iPhone X won't go on sale until Nov. 3.RELATED:The Big Picture: More Breakouts Ahead Of Fed Meeting These Chip Stocks Broke Out In Bullish Trading ActionTwo Chip Equipment Stock Breakouts: Similar Bases, With Key DifferencesChip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry NewsHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple RoutineStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

149,SWKS,"Stock futures pointed to a slightly higher open Thursday, with some key stocks to watch.Apple (AAPL) is in a buy zone, but that hasn't yet provided big coattails for iPhone chip stocks. Apple suppliers Broadcom (AVGO), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) are all worth watching, though. Meanwhile, Boeing (BA), which has outflown Apple as 2017's top performer on the Dow Jones industrial average, is finally creating a new possible entry.Boeing is benefiting from strong demand for civilian aircraft as well as improving prospects for defense and other government contracts. Boeing has been one of the hottest stocks in 2017, rising 53% vs. 38% for Apple. Over the past year Boeing has skyrocketed 77% against Apple's 47%. Boeing broke out of a consolidation in late January and again in May. Since then, the aerospace giant has run sharply higher, finding support at its 10-day moving average.But over the past few weeks Boeing has consolidated. It's now formed a three-weeks-tight pattern with a potential buy point of 246.59. A three-weeks-tight offers a new entry for existing shareholders to add slightly to their holdings, but they should try to buy as close to the trigger point as possible.It's not a proper buy zone for new investors, but if Boeing continues to consolidate a flat base could develop.Boeing dipped 0.8% to 238.09 in Wednesday stock market trading.Apple rose 0.1% to 159.98 on Wednesday, still in range from a 156.75 flat-base entry. Apple is a big buyer of chips, so what's good for Apple should be good news for iPhone suppliers and stocks. But so far Apple chipmakers have not joined Apple in buy range.Broadcom: Broadcom rose 0.7% to 256.92, briefly hitting a record high intraday. Broadcom does not have a proper buy point. In late July it just topped a 256.88 buy point from a flat base. But the stock then retreated, falling more than 7%, making that entry invalid. If Broadcom consolidates for a few more days, it will have a new valid flat base. But that's a big if, given that the chipmaker reports earnings late Friday.Analysts expect to see revenue up 18% to $4.458 billion with earnings jumping 39% to $4.03 a share, according to Zacks Investment Research.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report.

156,SWKS,"The cup-with-handle base is a classic setup that appears over and over again throughout the years. Stocks change, but investor psychology doesn't.XTesla (TSLA) now has a proper handle to go with its cup base, giving it a lower entry point. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) chip plays Texas Instruments (TXN), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Applied Materials (AMAT) also are in cup-with-handle patterns, as is LogMeIn (LOGM).During Tuesday's session, the S&P 500 index fell a fraction and the Nasdaq composite dropped 0.1%. The Dow industrials closed just above break-even, helped by Apple's rise to a new high.Tesla has been working on a cup base going back to late June. As of Tuesday's close, Tesla's handle has reached the minimum five days to create a cup-with-handle pattern. Tesla, which dipped 0.4% to 362.33 on Tuesday, is just 2% off the new potential buy point of 370.10. Until Tuesday's close, the buy point was 387.09, just above the left side of the cup and the all-time high.The cup with handle, which should look a lot like a tea cup, must be at least seven weeks long. (A cup-without-handle pattern must be six weeks.) The midpoint of the handle must be in the upper half of the overall pattern. The handle should be flat to downward-sloping, ideally on light volume. A slight downward drift helps shake out weak holders before a new uptrend. If and when a stock breaks out from the handle, new buyers must bid up the price because existing investors aren't eager to sell.Tesla has a good-but-not great Composite Rating of 82 out of 99, with its strong share price performance somewhat offsetting continued losses. All-time winners often have a Composite Rating of at least 95 as they begin big price moves.Texas Instruments makes chips for automotive and wireless industries, among others. Its products can be found in the Apple iPhone.The stock is in a cup-with-handle pattern going back to early June. The handle is nearly three weeks long with the buy point at 84.34, 10 cents above the top of the handle. Volume has generally been light in the handle.TI has rebounded from its 50-day moving average after closing just below that level on Friday. Shares fell 0.1% to 81.95 on Tuesday.Texas Instruments has a strong-but-not-stellar 89 Composite Rating.As for Apple itself, the tech titan cleared a 156.75 flat-base buy point earlier this month following its strong quarterly earnings and guidance. Apple hit a record high Tuesday, still within the 5% chase zone. So far iPhone suppliers haven't followed suit. Apple has a 94 Composite Rating.Skyworks is another Apple iPhone chipmaker. Its buy point is 108.66 in a base going back to early June. The stock has dipped below the 50-day line a couple of times in the handle, but is back above that area, rising 0.3% to 105.80. Skyworks has a Composite Rating of 95.Applied Materials is not an Apple supplier per se. But the chip- and display-equipment maker has been touted as a beneficiary of Apple and other handset makers choosing to use OLED screens in future smartphones.The stock is in cup with handle, though the handle is large relative to the size of the cup base that started in early June. But the midpoint of the handle is above the midpoint of the pattern, so it's valid. The buy point is 47.69. Applied Materials, which has a 98 Composite Rating, advanced 0.2% to 43.88 on Tuesday.Applied Materials will report earnings Thursday evening.LogMeIn offers online meeting connection services, including freemium products such as Join.me.The stock is in a shallow cup-with-handle going back to early May, finding support recently at its 50-day line. LogMeIn has a 121.35 entry. The stock, which fell 1.4% to 116.15 on Tuesday, has a 98 Composite Rating.RELATED:The Big Picture: Small Caps Slammed; This Sector Sells Off HardBullish Chart Patterns: Do You Know The Basics Of A Cup With Handle?Bullish Chart Patterns II: How To Find The Exact Buy PointBreakout Watch: LogMeIn Boosted By Triple-Digit Earnings, Sales GrowthStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

157,SWKS,"U.S. stock indexes retreated midday Tuesday, after President Trump tweeted Sunday that the administration was considering stopping trade with any country that does business with North Korea.The Nasdaq dropped 0.6%, the S&P 500 fell 0.5%, and the Dow Jones industrial average 0.7%. The small cap Russell 2000 trimmed 0.4%. Volume was up on both major exchanges, but low volume Friday made for an easy comparison.Over the weekend, North Korea tested what experts reportedly believe to be a hydrogen bomb. Trump's reaction was twofold. He announced that the U.S. would sell sophisticated military equipment to Japan and South Korea, and he threatened to halt trade with any country doing business with North Korea. China is North Korea's chief trading partner.Aerospace and defense stocks didn't react much. The group fell 0.3%.Gold did react, as the iShares Gold Trust (IAU) gapped up 0.9%. Gold-mining stocks also did well. Randgold Resources (GOLD) gapped up 2.4%; Franco Nevada (FNV), 1.5%; and Pan American Silver (PAAS), up 2%.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, oil stocks posted the best gains.

158,SWKS,"On Tuesday, the major averages fell in above-average volume. But the S&P 500 index closed above its 50-day moving average. Leading groups generally held up well. And leading stocks, from Apple (AAPL) to Wal-Mart (WMT) to FANG stocks Facebook (FB) and Netflix (NFLX) to biotech breakouts such as Celgene (CELG) and Biogen (BIIB), acted normally or outperformed amid a negative session.XS&P 500 futures rose 0.1% above fair value early Wednesday morning. Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.15%. Dow futures advanced 0.1%.The S&P 500 index fell 0.8% in Tuesday's stock market trading. The Nasdaq composite retreated 0.9% and the Dow industrials 1.1%. With volume higher than Friday's, the market added a distribution day, which is not good. But it was the first distribution day since mid-August. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index and the Dow industrials found support at their 50-day lines after undercutting that key level intraday. The Nasdaq composite, on the heels of its best week in 2017, held above its 50-day throughout Tuesday's session.Investors should pay close attention to the action of the major averages but also that of leading stocks. And leading stocks show some strength. Apple fell 1.2% to 162.08 on Tuesday, but that's still comfortably above a 156.75 flat base buy point. Apple iPhone chipmaker Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) peeked out past a buy point Tuesday morning. Skyworks pulled back, but still finished with a solid 1.3% gain.Wal-Mart rose 1.8% to 79.80, rebounding above its 50-day line as the discounter tries to retake an 80.57 cup-base buy point.Facebook dipped 0.8% after a 3.4% pop last week, still only about 2% off a buy point from its newly formed flat base. Netflix dipped 0.1%, holding above its 50-day in its own flat base.Biotechs Celgene, Biogen and CAR-T drug specialist Bluebird Bio (BLUE) ceded some ground Tuesday after all surged last week. But they closed above their buy points from last week's breakouts.Most top industry groups fell less than 1%, including video game publishers, homebuilders and biotechs. Among the higher-rated groups losing more than 1%, most were finance-related.Financials were big losers on Tuesday. Banks were hit by Treasury yields and yield spreads falling to pre-election levels. Property insurers fell as Hurricane Irma grew in strength with Florida in its sights. Airline stocks were hit by Irma and Delta Air (DAL) cutting forecasts for unit revenue and profit margins in the current third quarter.Tuesday's action was better than first impressions, while the market is in a confirmed uptrend. But as stocks grind higher with choppy action, it's difficult for investors to make much headway. A top stock may rally to a buy point and then clear it, but then quickly pull back below that entry, even though the general trend is positive. So investors should be cautious but act decisively when making purchases, taking profits and cutting losses.RELATED:The Big Picture: 2 Signs The Market Can BounceStocks Falter, But Here Are 3 Reasons Why Apple Is FineWhich FANG Stock Will Be The First To Break Out?Facebook, Boeing Lead These 5 Top Stocks Near Buys In This Bullish PatternU.S. Markets Back To Work; These 2 Top Stocks Are Racing Toward BuysStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

166,SWKS,"The iPhone 8 smartphone could still be late to market despite Apple's (AAPL) rosy sales forecast for the September quarter. So where's the money going to come from?XJPMorgan analyst Rod Hall believes the sales upside in Apple's outlook is from two new LCD-display smartphones, the rumored iPhone 7S series, not the flagship iPhone 8. He thinks the iPhone 7S handsets, upgraded versions of the current iPhone 7 series, will ship in September, as is usual for new iPhones. But the OLED-screen iPhone 8, or iPhone Pro, will ship in the December quarter, which starts Oct. 1, Hall said in a report Wednesday. He rates Apple as overweight with a price target of 176.Investors now are discounting news reports that the OLED iPhone could arrive weeks later than normal and be seriously supply constrained at launch.Apple stock rose 4.7% to 157.14 on the stock market today, clearing a 156.75 buy point, but near session lows after hitting a record 159.75 early.Apple stock received at least 19 price-target hikes from Wall Street analysts on Wednesday after the company's beat-and-raise fiscal third quarter report late Tuesday.

Three were from analysts with neutral ratings and price targets of 146 to 150.Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White was the most bullish of the bunch, reiterating his buy rating and upping his price target to 208 from 202.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 74, meaning it has outperformed 74% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more information on Apple, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Apple's fiscal third-quarter results came in above expectations thanks to better-than-forecast iPad sales and the company's robust services business.IPhone sales totaled 41 million units, up 2% year over year and in line with expectations during what is Apple's seasonally weakest quarter for smartphone sales. Apple iPhone sales typically slow ahead of the company's annual smartphone refresh, which historically occurs in September.For Apple's fiscal fourth quarter ending Sept. 30, the company expects sales to rise nearly 8% year over year to $50.5 billion, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Apple did not give an earnings-per-share target. Wall Street was modeling for Apple to earn $1.81 a share on sales of $49.21 billion.Apple's outlook implies that fears of an iPhone 8 delay or limited availability of the device ""may be overblown,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said in a note to clients.""It's worth noting that, during the June quarter, iPhone channel inventory was reduced to the lowest level in 2.5 years, leaving a clean channel ahead of the iPhone X launch,"" Olson said. He rates Apple as overweight with a price target of 190.BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long said Apple's September-quarter guidance points to the company shipping a ""premium iPhone Pro,"" aka iPhone 8, alongside the standard ""S"" model refresh in September, ""though initial volumes are likely to be extremely constrained.""""We believe the key to the (September-quarter guidance) is the higher revenue, as it indicates expectations of a healthy start for the new launch,"" Long said. He rates Apple as outperform with a price target of 180.Apple's fiscal fourth-quarter guidance implies sales of about 50 million iPhones, vs. consensus estimates of 46 million, Nomura analyst Jeffrey Kvaal said in a report. He rates Apple as buy with a price target of 175.And its sales outlook did not settle the debate about the iPhone 8 launch, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said in a report Wednesday. He rates Apple as outperform with a price target of 175.""We see three possible scenarios … the most likely of which is that iPhone 8 (OLED offering) will be announced but is not available in September, and that Apple offers compelling new iPhone 7S devices, and potentially discontinues existing iPhone 7 and 7-Plus offerings,"" he said. Sacconaghi rates the likelihood of that scenario happening at 50%.In a second scenario, Apple would make the iPhone 8 available in limited quantities in September. He rates the likelihood of that happening at 40%.The third scenario, with only a 10% probability, has Apple releasing the iPhone 8 in September in usual volumes for a new handset, Sacconaghi said.Regardless of initial volumes, Apple is likely to see a surge of iPhone customers upgrading over the next four to eight quarters, he said.Apple's reassuring guidance is good news for its component suppliers.Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer said chipmakers Broadcom (AVGO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) are his top Apple supply-chain picks for the upcoming iPhone 8 cycle.

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.6%.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) continued to show why it could be the top dog of the Dow in 2017 as the iPhone, iPad and iTunes media giant added more than 1%, to 133.69, hoisting its overall gain from a Sept. 14 breakout to 21%, out of a bottoming base pattern at 110.33.A number of Apple supplier plays continued to show fortitude.

The Dow fell to as low as 19,784 by Jan. 31, a drop of just 1%, before settling down and resuming its rally.Notice on a daily chart how the Dow continues to trade above its rising 50-day moving average (currently 18,616), a sign of strength. Elsewhere in the stock market today, Nvidia (NVDA) triggered a short-sale entry by falling more than 7% below a recent later-stage cup without handle at 120.03. Shares dropped more than 4% to 108.43, more than 8% below that 120.03 entry.Volume has hit 24 million shares, already 27% above its 50-day moving average of 18.8 million shares.However, notice how the stock is still well above its 50-day moving average (currently near 108.41), making it a risky short sale. Why?IBD's studies of former big winners show that a stock that is breaking down after a huge run-up tends to cross below the 50-day moving average in big volume, then show further declines.

The Dow Jones industrial average outperformed with a 0.25% gain as investors deployed more cash into oil drilling, fertilizer, ship transport, basic chemicals and mining gear stocks.The S&P 500 advanced nearly 0.2% at 2 p.m. Washington D.C. time, while the Russell 2000 rose nearly 0.5%. The former is poised for a flat weekly finish, but the latter is on course to lose more than 1%.After Donald Trump finishes his swearing-in ceremony, he and family members are scheduled to join members of Congress for a lunch of steak, lobster, ice cream and chocolate souffle, according to reports by USA Today.While some commentators showed disapproval over Trump's inaugural address, the fact that it didn't rain on the outdoor ceremony may confirm an odd trend that shows good weather on the important day has led to higher returns.Research by LPL Financial, the investment advisory giant, shows that in terms of the S&P 500, since 1949, no rain or snow on Inauguration Day has presaged an average annualized 11.4% positive return during a presidential term, as seen in 13 occurrences. The median return was 11.1%. But when there's some precipitation, the average return was -1.3% and the median return was +1.7% (across six occurrences).Meanwhile, certain chip manufacturing firms rallied sharply, a subtle hint that perhaps Apple (AAPL), up mildly to 120.02, may continue to extend its gains since forming a bottoming base that led to an initial breakout on Sept. 14.Apple iPhone supplier Broadcom (AVGO) vaulted nearly 3% to 190.80, adding to strong gains the prior two sessions, and is now extended more than 5% past a 178.12 early entry within a flat base. The diversified semiconductor giant, which merged with Singapore-based Avago Technologies last year, joined IBD Leaderboard as an emerging new winner on Oct. 24. Another iPhone play, Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), gapped up 12.5% to 88.26, moving sharply past persistent upside resistance near 80 seen over the past four months.The Woburn, Mass., firm reported a 1% rise in Q4 profit to $1.61 a share, barely above estimates, but it halted a two-quarter slide of falling profit. Revenue sank 1%, smaller than the 7% and 5% drops seen in the prior two quarters.Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), also in IBD's semiconductor manufacturing industry group, rose more than 1% to 30 in heavy trading. The chip foundry titan is working on a new shallow base that for now features a 31.71 entry.Watch to see if the mega-cap tech firm, which has a market value exceeding $155 billion and sports a 2.5% annualized yield, can hold above its 50-day moving average while continuing to form its new base.Returning to Apple, the largest publicly traded company in the U.S. financial markets, shares rose 6 cents to 119.83, lagging stronger gains by the major indexes. However, the stock continues to slowly rise past a new 11-week cup-with-handle entry at 118.12 and is acting like a big-cap growth stock should. Apple is fighting concerns over what the next great product will be. As IBD tech writer Patrick Seitz noted in a recent IBD Weekly front-page piece, since the start of the Tim Cook era as CEO, the Silicon Valley giant has debuted just one brand-new product, the Apple Watch, and the company declines to disclose quarterly sales.Looking at the stock action of Apple Watch rival FitBit (FIT) (currently at 7.07 a share, more than 86% below its 51.90 peak set on Aug. 5, 2015), it seems apparent that the size of the potential market for the Apple Watch is limited.However, Apple still has plenty going for it, including a huge treasury of cash, a rising cash payout to shareholders that gives the stock an annualized yield of 1.9%, accelerating growth in service-related revenue, the possibility that an upcoming new iPhone will reinvigorate sales of its most important revenue generator, and decent changes of an earnings turnaround.In the past three quarters, Apple's earnings per share declined 18%, 23% and 15% vs. year-ago levels amid a slump on the top line. For the fiscal first quarter, however, Wall Street sees earnings falling just 2% to $3.22 a share.In the prior four quarters, Apple exceeded the consensus estimate three times, and the average beat was 1.7%.After forming a first cup with handle with a 110.33 proper entry from April to September of 2016, Apple rallied nearly 8% before getting reeled back into its long, deep bottoming base.The new cup with handle, which formed from Oct. 11 last year to the start of January, featured a shallower decline from head to toe of just 12%, a good sign because it implies strengthening underlying demand for shares.RELATED:The Case For A Trump Era Secular Bull Run: Which Sectors May Lead Stocks?Skyworks Skies To 16-Month High As Earnings Beat, Apple In LineThe Bottoming Base, Part I: How It Helps Traders Make MoneyThe Bottoming Base, Part II: Why Apple Formed One In 200910 Years After The iPhone Debut, How Will Apple Innovate Now?Investing Like A True Wall Street Wizard: Lessons From Gerald Loeb

188,SWKS,"IBD research shows that the 600 best-performing stocks between 1952 and 2001 had one thing in common: strong earnings growth.""During bull markets (major market uptrends), I prefer to concentrate on stocks that show powerful earnings gains of 40% to 500% or more,"" IBD founder and Chairman William J. O'Neil wrote in ""How to Make Money in Stocks.""The ""C"" in IBD's CAN SLIM investing system stands for current quarterly earnings. Companies whose profit is rising sharply tend to be those that are operating efficiently or offer superior products and services. Dell, Cisco Systems and America Online were among stocks whose big advances during the 1980s and 1990s were fueled by strong earnings growth.Strong earnings growth is defined as a minimum 25% increase in quarterly earnings per share compared with the year-earlier quarter. Such numbers tend to produce an Earnings Per Share Rating of 80 or higher on a scale of 1 to 99, a level that investors should look for when creating watch lists of the best growth stocks.""You have thousands of stocks to choose from.Why not buy the very best merchandise available?"" O'Neil wrote.Accelerating gains are even better. Stocks with the best potential tend to have two or three quarters of increasing year-over year profit growth leading up to their breakouts.""Our analysis of the most successful stocks also showed that, in almost every case, earnings growth accelerated sometime in the 10 quarters before a towering price move began,"" O'Neil wrote.Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) showed accelerating earnings-per-share growth in the quarters leading up to its January 2014 breakout past a 28.66 buy point of a handle on a long first-stage consolidation.From a decline of 2% in the fiscal fourth quarter that ended in September 2012, profit rose 8%, 14%, 20%, 21% and 22% in the quarters prior to the breakout. That's five quarters in a row of EPS acceleration.At the time, Skyworks also possessed a 93 Composite Rating and a 94 Earnings Per Share Rating when it cleared the buy point. Another key metric, the SMR Rating — which stands for ""sales, profit margins and return on equity"" — was a robust A on a scale of A to E. (You can see all of these ratings at a glance and how a company sizes up against its industry peers in each of these measures by going to IBD Stock Checkup.)Skyworks offered investors several secondary buying opportunities en route to an ultimate gain of 294% to its peak of 112.88 in June 2015. New follow-on entry points included a couple of rebounds off its 10-week moving average. Buying on the first two rebounds off a stock's key support line carries less risk than those that occur further along the way up.Later, in January 2015, Skyworks broke out past a 75.07 buy point of a three-weeks tight pattern, another follow-on entry, as earnings growth continued to accelerate, rising 54%, 75% and 88% in the quarters leading up to the breakout.You can get a sense of a stock's earnings growth history by going to the Stock Checkup tab, located inside the Research tab at Investors.com.

195,SWKS,"Chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), aka TSMC, early Thursday posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, but gave cautious first-quarter guidance.U.S. shares of TSMC were down 2.9% to 29.29 on the stock market today. The stock hit an all-time high of 31.61 on Oct. 25 and has been forming a flat base for 12 weeks, with a 31.71 buy point.For the December quarter, TSMC earned 61 cents per American depositary receipt, up 42% year over year, on sales of nearly $8.25 billion, up 32%.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected TSMC to earn 59 cents per ADR on sales of $8.16 billion.IBD'S TAKE: TSMC stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 87, meaning it has outperformed 87% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. But it is ranked No. 12 out of 39 stocks in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group. To see which companies lead the group, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.""Due to stronger demand for TSMC's 16-nanometer technology and a more favorable exchange rate than our original forecast, fourth-quarter revenue surpassed the high-end of our guidance given three months ago,"" TSMC Chief Financial Officer Lora Ho said in a statement. ""Moving into first quarter 2017, we forecast the demand is weaker than the prior quarter due to mobile product seasonality and slightly above seasonal supply chain inventory at the end of 2016.""For the current Q1, TSMC forecast revenue of $7.44 billion at the midpoint of its guidance. It did not give an earnings target.Wall Street has been modeling TSMC to earn 51 cents per ADR, up 34%, on sales of $7.67 billion, up 25%, in the March quarter.TMSC is a member of IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group, which was down more than 1% in afternoon trading Thursday, a down day for the overall market and for many chip stocks.

196,SWKS,"Apple (AAPL) and Huawei will take share from Samsung and Xiaomi within the Chinese smartphone market, leading to mass volatility and an inventory work-down for chipmakers like Broadcom (AVGO), Qorvo (QRVO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), an MKM analyst predicted Wednesday.Shares of Broadcom, Qorvo and Skyworks were up a fraction each in early afternoon trading on the stock market today, while Apple stock was down a fraction. Last month, Apple reported March-quarter sales that missed views for the first time since 2003, undercutting chip stocks, which have broadly fallen since.The Apple report bolsters concerns of a smartphone slowdown, fresh off worries that Chinese smartphone saturation would stunt further growth. But, MKM analyst Ian Ing notes, the brimming Chinese market is still buying.Of 1,000 Chinese respondents in an MKM survey, more than 60% plan to buy a new smartphone within the next three to six months vs. less than 25% of U.S. respondents, Ing wrote in a research report. Of those in China, 38% plan to switch brands.""Chinese consumers are even more gadget-friendly relative to U.S. consumers,"" Ing wrote. ""Ownership is higher across smartphones, PCs and tablets in rank order.""Nearly 97% of Chinese consumers own a smartphone vs. 84% of Americans, but 25% of Chinese respondents plan to add another smartphone account -- likely expanding to children and the elderly -- vs. only 7.5% of Americans, Ing wrote, suggesting that Chinese users refresh their smartphones annually.Advances in wireless charging and fingerprint sensing will drive further adoption, he wrote.In smartphones, Apple, Huawei and LeTV look likely to take share from Xiaomi, Samsung and Lenovo, Ing wrote. Chinese consumers are more driven by brand (68% vs. 43% of Americans) and less by cost (33% vs. 61% of Americans).Those dramatic swings in share could affect chipmakers like Qorvo and Skyworks, which are 32% and 20% exposed to China, respectively. Ing estimates 40% of Qorvo's mobile sales stem from China. Fellow Apple suppliers Qualcomm (QCOM) and Broadcom are less exposed -- mid-teens and less than 10%, respectively, Ing said.""That said, Qorvo is favorably exposed to Huawei as a 10% customer,"" he noted.

198,SWKS,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) will grow 4% in 2016, missing projections for 5%-10% growth, as Apple (AAPL) cuts its iPhone 7 orders June through December, a source told the Nikkei Asian Review on Wednesday.Nikkei's report comes on the heels of disappointing June-quarter guidance from Apple suppliers Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and InvenSense (INVN). Tuesday, TSM reported Q1 sales that missed by $30 million and dipped 13% year over year.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Taiwan Semi stock was down a fraction, near 23.June through December, TSM's chip shipments will shrink to 70%-80% of year-earlier levels, sources told Nikkei. TSM is now projected for ""tepid"" 4% year-over-year sales growth and flat operating profits in 2016. In 2015, sales rose 7.5% to $25.95 billion.""Suppliers are saying that they are getting fewer orders for the second half of this year compared with the year-ago period,"" a source told Nikkei. ""The traditional peak season this year will not be able to compare to the past few years.""The report jibes with worries of a slowdown in smartphone sales. Last month, Apple missed its March-quarter Q2 sales for the first time in 13 years and guided its June-quarter sales down 15%-19% sequentially, which is the seasonal norm.The only Chinese smartphone makers showing healthy growth are Huawei and Oppo, the source said.Apple CEO Tim Cook has said his company plans to lower its channel inventories by $2 billion in the June quarter ""in light of the macroeconomic environment.""Apple has tapped TSM as the sole source of its A10 processor for the iPhone 7, expected for release in September. Last year, TSM and South Korean rival Samsung both supplied the A9 processor for the iPhone 6S. About 16% of TSM's sales stem from Apple.Nikkei estimates Apple will ship more than 200 million iPhones this year, down from 230 million in 2015. A source with a major Taiwanese supplier blamed the lack of innovation in the iPhone 7 for the weak demand, Nikkei reported.

199,SWKS,"Tesla Motors (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk's pledge to make 1 million electric cars by 2020 could be a boon for chipmakers clobbered by the first decline in sales of Apple's (AAPL) iPhone, a major hit product that fueled growth for many Apple suppliers since 2007.Now, hunger for the next growth vector has many chipmakers eyeing the automotive and Internet of Things markets, even as smartphones will remain a key profit center for some semiconductor companies.""I view the IoT market as a massive opportunity, and the autonomous vehicle is a part of that,"" Edward Jones analyst Bill Kreher told IBD. ""Over time, this market will experience widespread adoption. Simply, the promise of greater productivity will drive demand over the long run.""The deck is always reshuffled every few years and always to the most innovative technology. We think the IoT is the next battleground.""Kreher expects the IoT industry overall, including automotive, to grow 10% to 15% annually in the next three years.Sensor makers like Analog Devices (ADI), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Texas Instruments (TXN); analog chipmakers like MaxLinear (MXL) and Maxim Integrated Devices (MXIM); and graphics-chip companies like Nvidia (NVDA) are among those seen as especially primed in these fields.But not everyone is as hot on the Internet of Things. Robert Maire, president of tech research and consulting firm Semiconductor Advisers, calls today's cars ""PCs on wheels"" and ""smartphones on steroids,"" but he says other IoT fields typically use cheaper chips than the higher-end chips powering smartphones.Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) CEO David Aldrich said in April that the IoT opportunity is ""measured in the tens of billions of units,"" but Maire says that doesn't mean huge revenue growth.""It won't be the Internet of Things (replacing smartphones), because Internet of Things is based on typically trailing-edge semiconductor technology,"" Maire told IBD. ""About $5 worth of semiconductors go into an Internet-connected thermostat that sells for $75-$100.""The Qualcomm (QCOM) chip content alone in Apple's iPhone 6 has been estimated at $20 to $22 per unit by teardown specialist iFixit.But companies such as Qualcomm and Integrated Device Technology (IDTI) are looking beyond the smartphone era to a future dominated by smarter cities, smarter devices and smarter cars -- and are eagerly watching efforts by tech heavyweights Tesla, Apple and Google (GOOGL) to make it happen.Still, estimating the size of the IoT chip market is like a game of pin the tail on the donkey. The numbers are high but cover a lot of ground.Last year, research firm McKinsey pegged revenue for the total IoT market at $3.9 trillion to $11.1 trillion a year by 2025. At the highest end, that means IoT could account for more than 10% of the total world economy.In April, Business Insider estimated there will be 24 billion IoT-connected devices by 2020. More than $6 trillion will be invested in IoT solutions over the next five years, the online news site's Business Intelligence research unit estimates.Many of Apple's chip suppliers want a bite of IoT, but not all. Broadcom (AVGO) in April sold its Internet of Things unit to Cypress Semiconductor (CY) for $550 million. The unit generated just $189 million in revenue in the past 12 months, 3% of Broadcom's total sales.Broadcom declined to comment on the IoT unit's sale or on slowing smartphone sales. In its fiscal Q1 ended Jan. 31, Broadcom reported that its wireless business (which includes smartphone sales) pulled in $578 million in sales, about a third of total revenue. MKM analyst Ian Ing estimates 10% of Broadcom's mobile sales stem from smartphone-saturated China.Qorvo (QRVO) and Skyworks, Broadcom's rival makers of the radio-frequency chips that go inside smartphones, are buying into the IoT market -- Qorvo doing so literally with its April acquisition of IoT supplier GreenPeak. GreenPeak makes ultra-low-power, short-range wireless chips for smart homes.The acquisition should help Qorvo diversify. Qorvo didn't return requests for comment about slowing smartphone sales. For its fiscal Q4 ended April 2, Qorvo's mobile product sales accounted for $465 million, or about 76%, of total revenue.As for Skyworks, its integrated mobile systems and power amplifiers segments accounted for 73% of its total sales last quarter. Apple's iPhone 6S uses two Skyworks power amplifier modules, teardowns show.But Skyworks' broad markets division, which includes IoT-related sales, grew 18% vs. the year-earlier quarter and made up 25% of sales, Aldrich said on the company's earnings conference call in April. He estimated the IoT opportunity growing at an 83% compound annual growth rate through 2020.Apple Watch and Samsung Galaxy supplier Integrated Device Technology acknowledges the smartphone slowdown but says its future is in wireless charging. IDT's chips are used inside portable devices to enable wireless charging, which will become ever more important as Apple reportedly prepares to eliminate wired charging entirely from the iPhone 8 in 2017.IDT is about 17% exposed to the mobile market, CTO Sailesh Chittipeddi told IBD.Smartphones have reached a saturation point. But not every piece of accompanying technology has peaked, Chittipeddi said. RF suppliers Broadcom, Qorvo and Skyworks also say that while unit shipments might stagnate, dollar content will grow. In January, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said RF content has grown 20%-plus every year regardless the number of units shipped.Qualcomm -- doubly exposed through its chip sales and licensing business -- is also bullish on continued growth of its smartphone business. The breadth of technology on a smartphone will only continue to grow, CEO Steven Mollenkopf told analysts during the company's February analyst day.""The smartphone ecosystem is going to continue to grow, as wireless charging penetration of that market continues to increase,"" Chittipeddi told IBD. ""People still sell over 1.2 billion smartphones per year and not every one of them today has wireless charging.""And there are other demands for wireless charging. In March, IDT hosted a Hackster challenge, instructing participants to come up with new uses for wireless charging. Er Bharath Ram came up with an on-the-go coffee maker, beating out oddities like a tiny remote-controlled tank, a ""magic toothbrush"" and shoes for Alzheimer's sufferers.""Furniture, automotive applications, headsets, warmers, drones ... will provide growth,"" Chittipeddi said, though he concedes not as much growth as a new, high-volume smartphone.Last year, IDT expanded into sensors with the $310 million acquisition of ZMDI, Chittipeddi said. IDT plans to leverage that sensor business within the burgeoning automotive and infotainment market competing against NXP Semiconductors.About the same time IDT wrapped its ZMDI acquisition, NXP finished up its nearly $13 billion purchase of Freescale Semiconductors. NXP now boasts a $28.5 billion market cap to IDT's $2.7 billion. NXP CEO Rick Clemmer estimates 40% of his company's sales stem from the automotive segment.Clemmer says NXP spotted the smartphone's deceleration well ahead of time. Although, like Chittipeddi, he still sees growth for specialized smartphone tech. NXP chips are used to encrypt mobile payments for systems like Apple Pay, Samsung Wallet or Google Wallet.""Maybe 15% to 20% of smartphones have mobile wallets (and) we think that can go up to 60%,"" he said. ""We see a tripling of our volume because of the increased share that has the mobile wallet technology.""Buying Freescale helped de-emphasize mobile. In Q1, NXP's $471 million in secure connected devices (mobile) accounted for 21% of sales. But Clemmer says that exposure, on average, is about 15%. It also allowed the combined company to become the top automotive chip player, he says.NXP is also working with Tesla, Google, Apple and  Ford (F) as they work to develop self-driving cars, Clemmer says, another key push for NXP.That automotive opportunity will be huge, says Nvidia's director of automotive, Danny Shapiro. In April, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang unveiled a trio of autonomous cars code-named BB8, C3PO and R2D2 -- a riff on the popular ""Star Wars"" franchise.Like NXP, Nvidia has developed an autonomous-driving platform for carmakers. Unlike NXP, Nvidia only briefly dabbled in smartphones for which graphics only need to be ""good enough,"" Shapiro told IBD. Nvidia, he says, is angling for the bleeding edge of tech.So, no smartphone chips from Nvidia. ""There's no value there for us,"" Shapiro said. But ""I believe the car will be the most powerful computer you will ever own. ... We've moved beyond the graphics in your vehicles to being able to process the data. And for that, you need a supercomputer.""

200,SWKS,"Qorvo (QRVO) skirted Apple's (AAPL) iPhone shortfall by regaining Samsung Galaxy S7 share and riding the Chinese carrier aggregation trend, Needham analyst Quinn Bolton said Thursday after the chipmaker's blowout fiscal Q4.In morning trading on the stock market today, Qorvo stock was up 8%, trading near a three-week high above 48. But shares are down 12.5% year to date on Apple's weakness. Qorvo's largest customer -- widely assumed to be Apple -- accounts for a third of its total sales.Shares of rivals Broadcom (AVGO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) were up a fraction Thursday morning, after Qorvo's fiscal Q4 beat late Wednesday. Last week, Skyworks topped fiscal Q2 expectations, but its fiscal Q3 sales guidance lagged by about $50 million, helping send its shares down 6.9%.For Qorvo, the March quarter wrapped up with $608.1 million in sales and $1.04 earnings per share minus items, beating the consensus of 20 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $599.2 million and 92 cents. Year over year, sales and EPS fell 4% and 6%.Current-quarter guidance for $650 million in sales and $1.05 EPS ex items was also ahead of analysts' views for $628.6 million and 96 cents, but that would be down 6% and 12% vs. the year-earlier quarter.On Thursday, at least four analysts boosted their price targets on Qorvo stock.Mobile sales declined 5% sequentially to $465 million, ""driven by content gains on the Galaxy S7 platform that mostly offset a 24% quarter-over-quarter decline in sales to its largest customer,"" Bolton wrote in a research report.Industrial and defense products rose 9% to $142 million in sales, also helping offset the hit from Apple, Bolton wrote. Bolton boosted his price target on Qorvo stock to 53 from 50 and reiterated his buy rating.Qorvo is ""outperforming smartphone peers with content and share gains,"" he said.Behind Apple, Samsung and Huawei are Qorvo's largest mobile customers, Qorvo CFO Steven Buhaly said on the company's earnings conference call late Wednesday. Qorvo ""took the medicine"" in December when Apple iPhone sales began slowing, he said.Outside Apple, mobile sales will be ""up significantly"" in the June quarter, Steven Creviston, Qorvo's president of mobile products, said on the call. He credited growth in China and the carrier aggregation trend for the likely growth.In that segment, sales to Chinese ODMs (original design manufacturers) account for 40% of revenue. Carrier aggregation in China is driving demand for Qorvo's radio-frequency chips, Qorvo CEO Robert Bruggeworth said on the call.Rosenblatt analyst Jun Zhang expects Qorvo to swipe Skyworks' share on that trend. At Taiwanese MediaTek, Skyworks accounts for 80%-85% of all LTE chipsets, Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri wrote in a report. He, too, expects Qorvo to aggressively gain share, boosting his price target to 55 from 50 but keeping his market perform rating.

201,SWKS,"Qorvo (QRVO) sidestepped Apple's (AAPL) iPhone drag late Wednesday with a Wall Street-crushing fiscal Q4 earnings report, and with guidance that -- unlike rival Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) -- topped consensus expectations.In after-hours trading, Qorvo stock rocketed 7% after closing down 1.2% in Wednesday's regular session, and leading shares of radio-frequency rivals Skyworks and Broadcom (AVGO), whose stocks both rose a fraction.For its fiscal Q4 ended April 2, Qorvo reported $608.1 million in sales and $1.04 earnings per share minus items, down a respective 4% and 6% vs. the year-earlier quarter, but topping analysts' model for $599.2 million and 92 cents.Three months ago, Qorvo guided to $600 million and 90-95 cents.Qorvo ended fiscal 2016 with $2.61 billion in sales, up 53%, and $4.38 EPS ex items, down 8%. Sales edged the consensus of 20 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $2.6 billion, but EPS topped by 12 cents.Current-quarter guidance for $650 million in sales and $1.05 EPS minus items would be down 6% and 12% year over year, but that's ahead of analyst expectations for $628.6 million and 96 cents.Last week, Skyworks reported fiscal Q2 metrics that topped views, but shares crashed 6.9% on Q3 sales guidance that missed by about $50 million. Analysts called for a similar report from Qorvo, which is more heavily exposed to Apple's iPhone product cycle. Apple iPhone sales have slowed -- for the first time -- ahead of the iPhone 7 release expected in September.But all three RF suppliers will ramp up on the iPhone 7, Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari says.

203,SWKS,"Apple (AAPL) stock rose Monday as investors digested a positive iPhone 7 production report, along with a cautionary article that suggested Apple was at risk of becoming the next BlackBerry (BBRY).Apple stock rose 1.3% Monday, to 96.43, on the stock market today.Taiwan’s Economic Daily News reported Monday that Apple has ordered contract manufacturers to produce 72 million to 78 million iPhone 7 handsets this year, a record figure for a new iPhone and above analyst estimates of 65 million units.The iPhone 7 is expected to be released in September, with a slimmer design, faster processor and improved camera as compared to earlier iPhones. This 10th-generation iPhone might even sport a waterproof design for the first time.Meanwhile, influential tech blogger and Web developer Marco Arment on Saturday posted an article that argued Apple is falling behind Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google in artificial intelligence (AI), digital assistants and voice interfaces. He said Apple could miss the next big shift in computing, just as onetime cellphone giant BlackBerry missed the move to smartphones from email-centric feature phones.""Amazon, Facebook, and Google -- especially Google -- have all invested heavily in Big Data Web services and AI for many years, prioritizing them highly, iterating and advancing them constantly, accumulating relevant data, developing effective algorithms and attracting, developing and retaining tons of specialized talent,"" Arment wrote.Arment says Apple is not putting the same emphasis on Big Data and AI as its rivals.“Becoming a major Big Data AI services company doesn’t happen completely in secret and suddenly get released to the world, completed, in a keynote,” Arment said. “It’s a massive undertaking, spanning many years, many people and a lot of noticeable interaction with the world. It’s easier to conceal the development of an entire car than a major presence in AI and services.”Investors on Monday were more focused on the Economic Daily News article and a trio of reassuring analyst reports.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves on Sunday reiterated his overweight rating on Apple stock with a price target of 123.“We believe concerns about a potential lack of innovation in the iPhone 7 underestimate the extraordinary growth in the user base over the past two years, which is likely to drive increased replacement volume and overall iPhone unit growth in fiscal 2017, almost regardless of the hardware,” Hargreaves said.BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long also is positive on Apple because of the potential for iPhone users to upgrade with the iPhone 7 cycle.“What we find most interesting is that we believe we are entering the iPhone 7 cycle with the highest percentage of phones in the installed base at least two years old, at about 26% (compared to 23% for iPhone 6),” Long said. “This translates to about 120 million phones. As a result, we believe the device will drive an improved replacement rate, even if it has lackluster features.”Also, the huge growth in used iPhone sales will increase the installed base of iPhone users and boost services revenue, Long said. He reiterated his outperform rating on Apple stock, with a price target of 117.Nomura analyst Jeffrey Kvaal maintained his buy rating on Apple with a price target of 120. He noted the success of Apple’s recent iPhone SE launch but cautioned that the lower-cost smartphone could cannibalize sales of iPhone 6S handsets.Apple chip suppliers Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) each rose 2% Monday. Broadcom (AVGO) rose nearly 1% and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) ended up a fraction.RELATED:Apple Has Largest Cash Stockpile, Twice That Of Microsoft’sApple Faces ‘Existential Threat’ From Messenger Bots.

204,SWKS,"Chinese Huawei's P9 is a ""new dog with old iPhone tricks,"" beating Apple (AAPL) to the smooth-backed punch, but including the usual chip suspects -- Broadcom (AVGO), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Texas Instruments (TXN).But the iFixit teardown of the P9 smartphone did little for Broadcom stock was down a fraction in late-afternoon trading Friday, while NXP and Skyworks were both up a fraction. Texas Instruments stock, however, was up 1% on the stock market today.The Huawei P9 looks familiar, iFixit wrote, wondering, ""just how far did Huawei go to imitate, and perhaps surpass, the iPhone?"" IFixit notes the Huawei P9 camera is embedded within the body -- as opposed to the bump in the iPhone 6S.Apple suppliers fill the inside of the Huawei P9, but their functions can vary from the iPhone 6S. Samsung supplies both -- but it has a flash-memory chip inside the P9 as opposed to a RAM (random access memory) offering within the 6S, says iFixit.Huawei tapped SK Hynix for its RAM. Apple used Toshiba for its 6S flash memory.Texas Instruments supplied a fast-charging chip for the Huawei P9 vs. a power-management chip for the Apple 6S. And Huawei's audio codec by HiSilicon is mirrored by Cirrus Logic's (CRUS) chip inside the Apple flagship.Broadcom provides two chips for Huawei as opposed to a single chip for Apple. NXP, a single chip for the P9 and two chips for the 6S. The Huawei phone has three Skyworks chips vs. two Skyworks power amplifiers within the iPhone 6S.Huawei's and Apple's flagship phones both scored a 7 out of 10 on iFixit's scale of repairability.

205,SWKS,"Apple's (AAPL) iPhone drag will seize another victim Wednesday, a Goldman Sachs analyst suggested Tuesday, ahead of Qorvo's (QRVO) quarterly earnings report, with Wall Street forecasting the chipmaker's first year-over-year sales decline in eight quarters.But the Apple trough will likely resolve in the second half of the year, when the iPhone 7 ramps, Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari wrote in a research report. He expects radio-frequency chip rivals Qorvo, Broadcom (AVGO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) to see growth from the release of the iPhone 7, expected in September.""While unit headwinds and inventory burn at Apple could weigh on results, we believe we are at the trough of the cycle and expect RF fundamental to improve,"" Hari wrote. ""The RF content growth story is still fully intact.""First, though, heavily-Apple-exposed Qorvo has to survive the March quarter, for which Apple reported its first-ever year-over-year decline in smartphone sales.For Qorvo's fiscal Q4, the consensus of 20 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters models $599.2 million in sales and 92 cents earnings per share minus items, down a respective 6% and 17% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Qorvo reports after the close Wednesday.Three months ago, Qorvo guided to $600 million in sales and 90-95 cents EPS ex items. Qorvo's sales and EPS have decelerated for the past three and four quarters, respectively. Last quarter, EPS fell for the first time since September 2012.For the fiscal year, Qorvo is expected to report 52% sales growth, to $2.6 billion. But analyst consensus calls for a 10% decline in EPS ex items, to $4.26.In the stock market today, Qorvo stock rose a fraction to 45.04, while Broadcom fell 2% and Skyworks fell a fraction.Last week, Skyworks' fiscal Q2 metrics topped analysts' consensus, but Q3 guidance missed. Then, Skyworks stock dropped 6.9%. Hari says Qorvo stock could experience a similar dip. But Qorvo shares are already down 12% over the past 12 months, and ""weakness may not be as pronounced,"" he wrote.Hari cut his price target on Qorvo stock to 44 from 47 but kept his neutral rating. He trimmed his Broadcom stock price target to 171 from 175, but he still rates it and Skyworks both a buy.Among the three, Qorvo is the most Apple-exposed, Hari wrote.""We expect investors to focus on its (fiscal Q1) guide (impact of Apple fallout) and execution (share gains at Samsung),"" he wrote.

209,SWKS,"Apple (AAPL) iPhone shipments are likely to drop in the first half of 2017 vs. the same period in 2016, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a report.He predicts Apple will ship 40 million to 50 million iPhones in Q1, vs. 51.2 million in the year-earlier period. For Q2, Kuo is forecasting Apple to ship 35 million to 40 million iPhones, vs. 40.4 million a year earlier, according to Apple news website 9to5Mac.The iPhone shipment declines will put pressure on Apple's chip suppliers, Kuo said. At the same time, Apple is pushing component suppliers to reduce their prices, he said.Component suppliers with heavy exposure to Apple include Cirrus Logic (CRUS), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO).IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 68, meaning it has outperformed 68% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. However, there are more attractive stocks for investors to consider. For a list of leading growth stocks, check out the IBD 50.Apple is unlikely to refresh its lower-cost iPhone SE in Q1 or Q2 because the company wants to avoid cannibalizing sales of its premium iPhone 7 handsets, Kuo said. The iPhone SE debuted on March 24. Apple's decision to not upgrade the iPhone SE around its one-year anniversary is a move to bolster its gross profit margins, Kuo said.The primary reason for the iPhone shipment drop in the first half of 2017 is weak demand in China, Kuo said.Apple is expected to release its biggest change to the iPhone in three years with the iPhone 8 next fall. That 11th-generation handset is expected to have OLED display and wireless charging in at least some models.The iPhone 8 is expected to sport a new look, with a glass front and back in a metal frame.Apple stock closed up 1.4% at 110.41 on the stock market today.RELATED:OLED iPhones Could Spur Demand, But Lower Profit MarginsApple Contractor Testing Wireless Charging Module For iPhone 8Apple iPhone Grabs 104% Of Smartphone Industry Profit In Q3Skyworks Delights, Qorvo Disappoints In Earnings Reports

215,SWKS,"Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) is ""rebuilding"" after Apple's (AAPL) iPhone flop last quarter but is still looking at double-digit growth in the second half of 2016, MKM analyst Ian Ing wrote in a research note after Apple-supplier stocks broadly toppled last week, when the iPhone maker reported its first-ever year-over-year decline in smartphone sales.Monday, Skyworks stock rose a fraction, as did shares of radio-frequency chip rival Broadcom (AVGO). Another rival, Qorvo (QRVO), fell a fraction. Apple stock slipped a fraction Monday, to 93.64, and it's down 10.3% since reporting its March-quarter earnings after the close Tuesday.That day, Apple reported not only its first-ever year-over-year drop in iPhone sales, but also its first quarterly revenue decrease in 13 years. Skyworks' Q2 guidance, released late Thursday, slugged that stock when its sales view missed by $50 million.But after just 2% sales growth last quarter, Skyworks expects double-digit growth in September, though strength in China and with Samsung might not be enough to outweigh an ""unfavorable"" year-over-year iPhone comparison. Last September, Apple sold 13 million iPhone 6S units in three days following the release.Chinese smartphone-makers are facing a largely saturated market, Ing noted. About 45% of China's mobile phones are on 4G now. Wall Street largely expects a pause as the industry transitions to 5G -- but that refresh is still more than a year away.Ing retained his buy rating on Skyworks stock, but he cut the price target to 93 from 98. At least two other analysts rated Skyworks a buy over the weekend.

216,SWKS,"Apple’s (AAPL) ""iPhone drag"" tugged Skyworks Solutions’ (SWKS) fiscal Q3 guidance by $50 million late Thursday, prompting shares of radio-frequency chip rivals Broadcom (AVGO) and Qorvo (QRVO) to topple Friday.Skyworks stock led a broad Apple chip sphere fall, falling 6.9% to 66.82 on the stock market today. Shares of competitors Broadcom and Qorvo were down a respective 1.5% and 1.75%.NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Qualcomm (QCOM) and InvenSense (INVN) stocks followed, down 0.7%, 3.1% and 5.65%, respectively.Apple itself lost 1.15%, trading near its lowest levels since mid-2014.For its fiscal Q2, which ended April 1, Skyworks reported $775.1 million in sales and $1.25 earnings per share minus items, in line and topping the consensus of 25 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $775.6 million and $1.24.But EPS slipped to single-digit growth for the first time in 13 quarters, rising 9% year over year. Sales rose 2%, in the single-digit range for the first time in 14 quarters. Both metrics have decelerated for five consecutive quarters.Current-quarter guidance for $750 million in sales and $1.21 EPS ex items would be down 7% and 10%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. On a year-over-year basis, sales have never declined in the past five years. EPS has declined twice, but this quarter's decline would be the biggest.And both metrics lagged the consensus for $800.5 million and $1.32.Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh blamed the ""iPhone drag"" for Skyworks' weak guidance. On Tuesday, Apple reported its first year-over-year decline in iPhone sales and its first quarterly revenue drop in 13 years.Apple CEO Tim Cook said Tuesday that the company planned to cut channel inventories in the June quarter ""in light of the macroeconomic environment."" Late Tuesday, supplier Cirrus Logic (CRUS) offered Q3 guidance that also missed Wall Street views.But Skyworks expects a strong September quarter, with 20% and 40% content gains at Samsung and Huawei. On average, Chinese smartphones are growing content by 20% year over year, Rakesh wrote in a research report.Rakesh cut his price target on Skyworks stock to 99 from 105 but reiterated a buy rating.Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri estimates that 40 million to 50 million iPhones will be sold in the June quarter, leading to better upside in Skyworks' fiscal Q4. But he adds that Qorvo might be a stronger RF competitor now.Both analysts suggest that Skyworks look to diversify amid the slowing Chinese and iPhone markets. Arcuri reduced his price target on Skyworks stock to 76 from 78 and kept his market perform rating.

The results were similar to fellow Apple supplier NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), which late Monday reported consensus-topping Q1 earnings that also fell year over year.Cirrus Logic's current-quarter guidance lagged analyst consensus on softening iPhone sales. Late Tuesday, Apple said that it had shipped 51.19 million iPhones in the March quarter, down 16% from the year-earlier quarter.Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill cut estimates on Apple suppliers Skyworks and Qorvo ahead of their earnings reports, slated for after the market close Wednesday. Apple's June-quarter revenue guide for $41 million to $43 million implies 38 million iPhone shipments, Gill wrote in a research report.Analyst consensus currently estimates 44 million iPhone shipments for the June quarter, he wrote.""While we expect iPhone unit shipments to grow seasonally beyond the June quarter, we believe overall shipment levels are likely to be below our prior estimates,"" he wrote.

221,SWKS,"Apple (AAPL) stock tumbled to its lowest level in nearly two years on Thursday, following a report that Asian component suppliers are seeing weak orders related to the upcoming iPhone 7.Japanese business publication Nikkei Asian Review reported Thursday that Taiwan-based tech suppliers expect to get significantly fewer orders from Apple in the second half of this year compared with the year-earlier period. They cited the ""ongoing slump in demand for premium smartphones and a lack of groundbreaking features for the upcoming iPhone 7.""Nikkei Asian Review this week also reported that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) expects its iPhone chip shipments for the June-to-December period will be about 70% to 80% of the level reached in the second half of 2015.Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha said the market overreacted to the Nikkei report.The prediction that iPhone builds would be down 20% to 30% in the second half of the year vs. the same period in 2015 was expected and already should have been baked into the stock’s price.“While the news is clearly disappointing, it was already largely included in our iPhone unit estimates,” he said in a report Thursday.Elsewhere, Taiwan-based contract manufacturer Foxconn Technology Group said its first-quarter net profit fell 9.2% from a year earlier, as it was hit by a slowdown in iPhone sales, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. Foxconn is Apple’s main iPhone assembler.Apple stock fell 2.4%, to 90.32, on the stock market today, and fell as low as 89.47. TSM stock fell 1%, to 22.99.IBD's Take: How healthy is Apple's stock and how does it stand up vs. rivals? Find out at IBD Stock Checkup.Other Apple chip suppliers also fell Thursday, including InvenSense (INVN), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Cirrus Logic (CRUS), Broadcom (AVGO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Qorvo (QRVO) and Texas Instruments (TXN).Apple stock has risen in only four of the last 20 trading sessions. Since hitting its 2016 high of 112.39 on April 14, Apple stock has fallen about 20%.Most of the decline happened after the Cupertino, Calif.-based company reported March-quarter results and gave June-quarter guidance on April 26. For its fiscal Q2, Apple posted its first year-over-year sales decline since 2003 and its first-ever drop in iPhone unit sales. For the current Q3, Apple is targeting sales of $42 billion, down 15% from the same period last year.Demand for Apple's latest handsets, the iPhone 6S series, has been relatively weak, and hopes for a return to unit sales growth have shifted to the iPhone 7, expected to be released in September.The iPhone 7 is predicted to feature a slimmer design, a speedier processor and a better camera. It also might be waterproof for the first time, according to tech news reports. But it is expected to look pretty much like the current models, with tweaks like the lack of an audio headset jack.RELATED:Apple Stock Gets Price-Target Cut On Longer iPhone Upgrade Cycle.

222,SWKS,"Petering Apple (AAPL) and Samsung demand prodded a Raymond James analyst to downgrade suppliers NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Qorvo (QRVO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and others, even with the iPhone 7 launch expected in September.Apple suppliers broadly fell in morning trading on the stock market today. Radio-frequency chip companies Qorvo and Skyworks were down 2.6% and 2.2%, respectively, on the downgrade, tugging rival Broadcom (AVGO) down 1.3%.Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) stock was down more than 1%, while Apple suppliers Analog Devices (ADI), NXP and Texas Instruments (TXN) stocks were all down roughly 1%.In all, Raymond James analyst Steven Smigie downgraded six semiconductor stocks to outperform from strong buy, citing likely in-line earnings and minimal upside to June guidance.Following a January drop in the stocks, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index has rebounded 20% since mid-February, Smigie wrote in a research report. Some stocks have run up 40%, he noted.But ""with only modest signs that there is the potential for near-term upside to (earnings per share), and some signs of modest downside, we worry that shares have a limited upside, with reasonable downside risk,"" he wrote.Confidence could improve in the seasonally stronger second half of 2016, when Apple typically launches its newest iPhone flagship. But ""Apple is seeing modestly lower demand,"" said Smigie, who questioned the likelihood of a positive June guide by Apple. He also noted some pain points for radio-frequency suppliers that have more than 45% exposure to Apple.""Even if the Apple guide is healthy, we think skepticism will remain until the summer when we start to get evidence of the iPhone 7 ramp and questions about iPhone SE cannibalizing other iPhone models get resolved,"" he wrote.Samsung sales zoomed on its Galaxy S7 flagship, but pre-orders were likely influenced by free Gear VR (virtual reality) giveaways, Smigie wrote. Huawei, on the other hand, is a ""bright spot"" and recently guided to 120 million to 140 million units in 2016. The lion's share of those units will be high-end smartphones, Huawei said.Outside mobile, PC and industrial results have been weak, offsetting some strength in the growing automotive and infotainment arenas -- the latter being NXP's bailiwick following its acquisition of Freescale Semiconductor.But even in the automotive segment, ""we have heard concerns from a number of investors on subprime lending,"" Smigie wrote. Until those fears level out, automotive-exposed semiconductors could face some headwinds.Respective estimates from industry trackers Gartner and IDC show the PC segment saw 9.6% and 11.5% year-over-year declines in Q1 shipments. And March industrial production fell 0.6% vs. expectations for a 0.1% decline, says Smigie.Smigie notes positively, ""we still like many of the stories, however, so all else being equal, on a pullback we could look to get more aggressive again.""

230,SWKS,"Stocks stayed in the doghouse with light to moderate losses in afternoon trading Thursday. Commodities fell. Long U.S. government bonds slipped, sending the 10-year Treasury yield back above 1.80%.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, backtracked 1.5% to 109.88 in light volume, putting the stock just below its original 110.33 buy point in a new bottoming base that formed from April to September this year.IBD's study of past big stock market winners has shown that up to as many as four out of every 10 of these stocks will drop back to or near the proper buy point, shaking out some weak holders, before resuming the rally.Should traders get back into Apple now? IBD's rule is to wait for strength to return in both the stock and the market, which currently has an outlook of ""Uptrend under pressure"" as noted by IBD's daily Big Picture column.The Nasdaq composite slumped 0.5% in volume running slightly higher than the same time Wednesday, while the S&P 500 eased 0.2% in slower turnover. But large-cap software firm Adobe (ADBE) showed strength, gaining more than 1.6% to 107.55 in a second test of the 50-day moving average.The publishing and digital graphics software giant has gained more than 9% past a 98.10 base on base pattern that it initially cleared on May 24.The Dow Jones industrials were flat. None of the 30 components fell 1 point or more.Dow 30 component Walt Disney (DIS) led the upside, rising more than 1.5% to 93.33 and climbing back above the 50-day moving average. But the entertainment giant still lies below the key long-term 200-day line and has yet to produce any IBD-type bases that could set up a solid breakout. In November 2015, a breakout from a 117.68 cup-with-handle base lost juice after three days of gains, and Disney backtracked all the way down to a 52-week low of 86.25, down 29% from its all-time peak of 122.08.Apple initially broke out Sept. 14, rising 3.5% in triple normal volume in what became its first CAN SLIM-style breakout in more than a year. Since then, reports have generally favored the tech giant, from Samsung's missteps with the Galaxy Note 7 to strong orders for the iPhone 7 reported by some telecom carriers to the company's own report that services revenue continues to rise at strong double-digit pace.However, Apple still faces an overall revenue growth crisis, with sales dipping 13%, 15% and 9% vs. year-ago levels in the past three quarters. Wall Street expects the sales drought to end in the current fiscal first quarter, however; Apple is seen growing revenue in the December-ending quarter by 1.6% to $77.1 billion, then follow that up with an 8.1% top-line gain to $54.7 billion in Q2 (ending in March 2017).Elsewhere in the stock market today, Microsemi (MSCC) blasted more than 15% higher to an all-time high of 48.43 on reports that fellow mixed signal chip expert Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) is approaching the company for a potential acquisition. Microsemi recorded $1.25 billion in revenue in the latest fiscal year ended in September 2015, up 9%, while Skyworks posted $3.26 billion in FY 2015 revenue.Microsemi also sports solid earnings that belie its dull 69 EPS Rating from IBD Stock Checkup. In FY 2015, the Aliso Viejo, Calif., firm earned $2.73 a share, up 25% vs. a year ago and nearly four times the 75 cents it earned per share in FY 2009. Pretax margin was 22.9% in FY 2015, the highest in four years.Crude oil continued to tank, as WTI futures fell another 1.6% to $44.61 a barrel. On Wednesday, the EIA shocked investors by reporting a huge bulge in weekly U.S. crude oil inventories. WTI crude has now fallen 14% below its recent Oct. 19 peak of $51.60 and has also corrected 17% from its 52-week high of $53.66.The Dow utilities edged nearly 0.2% higher.RELATED:When Did Apple Break Out?Apple Losing Buy Point, Microsoft On EdgeIs Is Still Time To Be Cautious In Buying Breakouts?Do You Know How To Spot The Bottoming Base?Is Apple's iPhone Going The Way Of The Mac, OS-Wise?When Is The Best Time To Buy A High-Growth Stock?

233,SWKS,"U.K.-based chipmaker Dialog Semiconductor late Wednesday reported better-than-expected preliminary sales figures for the third quarter, providing a positive data point on its largest customer, Apple (AAPL).Dialog said it expects third-quarter revenue of about $345 million. That's 13% above the midpoint of its July guidance and 5% above Q3 2015 sales. The results are driven primarily by smartphones, RBC analyst Mitch Steves said in a research report.Dialog said some mobile system orders were pulled into Q3 from Q4 to accommodate a public holiday in China, Steves said.Apple represents about 75% to 80% of Dialog's annual sales, he said. Dialog provides power management chips for the iPhone and other devices.Dialog is slated to post its Q3 earnings report on Nov. 3.IBD'S TAKE: Apple supports a large ecosystem of component suppliers, including Dialog, whose shares are traded in Europe but not the U.S. Among U.S.-traded chip companies that supply Apple, Broadcom is one of the top performers. Broadcom is No. 26 on the IBD 50 list of superior stocks.Other chip suppliers with outsized exposure to Apple business include Broadcom (AVGO), Cirrus Logic (CRUS), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO).Apple stock rose 0.8% to 113.91 on the stock market today. Shares continue to hold over a 110.33 buy point crossed on Sept. 14.RBC analyst Amit Daryanani on Wednesday reiterated his outperform rating on Apple stock, with a price target of 125.""We think today's Dialog pre-announcement, in addition to several positive data points from the iPhone 7 launch, should provide investors with comfort heading into (Apple's) September quarter print,"" Daryanani said. Apple is scheduled to report September-quarter sales on Oct. 27.Positive data points for Apple include encouraging reports from wireless carriers on iPhone demand, potential share gains from Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 battery problems, and a mix shift toward premium models of the iPhone 7, he said.Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha said the Dialog news implies strong iPhone sales.The majority of Dialog's improved sales likely came from stronger iPhone business, supporting the thesis for a better-than-expected iPhone 7 cycle, he said in a report.
"
234,SWKS,"Garcha reiterated his outperform rating on Apple stock with a price target of 150.Meanwhile, Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley on Wednesday maintained his buy rating on Apple stock, with a price target of 140.""Based on our surveys, we believe demand for the new iPhone 7 products remains healthy with ongoing strong mix to higher"" average-selling-price models, he said in a report.Walkley raised his December-quarter iPhone sales estimate to 76.5 million from 75 million.""Between the aggressive U.S. carrier promotions, favorable premium-tier competitive environment due to the continued Galaxy Note 7 battery issues, improved iPhone 7 features and functionality, and stronger-than-anticipated initial consumer demand, we believe initial iPhone 7 sales continue to trend positively,"" he said.RELATED:Apple Prepping For Ambient Computing Era, The Next Paradigm ShiftGoogle's Pixel A 'Science Project,' Called A 'Nonevent' For Apple

235,SWKS,"If low volatility ETFs provide a zip line for investors to make it safely across choppy markets, their mirror opposite rips off the harness and pulley.A high beta exchange traded fund scoffs at the safe style of investing. It is a product for extreme stock market bulls, piling on risk instead of fleeing it.Tellingly, there's just one high beta ETF across a landscape of nearly 2,000 exchange traded funds listed in the U.S., and at least 18 low or minimum volatility ETFs. Right now, the high beta ETF is signaling investors are more ready for risk -- a word they loved to loathe early this year.Beta measures how much a security moves up or down relative to a benchmark.PowerShares S&P 500 High Beta (SPHB) invests in the 100 most volatile stocks in the S&P 500, giving the fund a beta of 1.59. That means the fund's returns make far sharper up- and-down moves than the broad market. The ETF debuted alongside PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV) on the same day in May 2011 but has gathered a fraction of that popular peer's $6.59 billion in assets.However, the high beta ETF has brought in $225 million in new money so far in October, helping it double assets to $450 million.""With the 10-year Treasury yield rising, the U.S. economy improving, and expectation of stronger 2017 earnings from cyclical sectors, investors have recently been gravitating toward higher beta securities,"" Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research for CFRA, wrote in an Oct. 17 note.Investors took note of SPHB as it started to significantly outpace the underlying S&P 500 index starting in the third quarter. The ETF sits 3% below its Oct. 10 peak, but is rallying again.The sector tilts in this fund aren't timid. Financials account for nearly 32% of assets, energy 29% and technology 15%. It holds white-knuckle names such as Chesapeake Energy (CHK), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and E-Trade Financial (ETFC) from these economically sensitive sectors.It has low or no stakes in defensive, income-oriented sectors such as health care, consumer staples and utilities.So why would ETF investors want to grab the most volatile S&P names? To add equity risk to a portfolio if they're feeling bullish on stocks, Rosenbluth told IBD in a phone call.IBD'S TAKE: Investors looking for signals on when to buy or sell a high beta fund should look at indicators predicting profit growth and economic growth. Favorable signs include upward revisions to analyst profit outlooks, an increase in economic surprise indexes, rising treasury yields, rising commodity prices and a rising trend in the ISM surveys as has been seen recently.The ETF's sector bets look attractive given the higher odds of a near-term Fed rate hike. ""Higher bond yields have caused, and could continue to cause, investors to rotate away from income-oriented sectors,"" Rosenbluth said.So far this year, the ETF's strategy of dialing up risk has been rewarded.SPHB was up 10.9% through Oct. 18 on the back of an outstanding Q3, vs. a 7.1% gain for its low volatility sibling and 6.5% for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY).Higher risk stocks tend to perform best when economic growth is accelerating, credit spreads are narrowing, and volatility is falling or low, said Nick Kalivas, senior equity product strategist at PowerShares.However, people who equate high beta with stocks going in one direction -- up, a lot -- may be in for a shock.""Volatility cuts both ways,"" Kalivas cautioned.In 2013, SPHB jumped nearly 41%, while SPY gained 32%. In 2015, when SPY eked out a roughly 1% gain, SPHB tanked 13%.""It's important to know what you are getting yourself into,"" Kalivas told IBD in phone call. Unlike low volatility, high beta is not a rewarded factor providing excess returns over time.""It's a much more tactical strategy to express a short-term view of strong market conditions,"" Kalivas said. That may make it a powerful tool for successful ETF investing looking ahead.However, investors feeling aggressive may wish to consider other factor-based ETFs as buy-and-hold investments.""Value and size allow investors to capture a more bullish outlook and be rewarded over the longer time,"" said Kalivas. Both factors are generating considerable interest in the current market, he added.Value tends to have more beta than more conservative factors like quality and low volatility. And PowerShares FTSE RAFI US 1500 Small-Mid Portfolio (PRFZ) is a way for ETF investors to capture the historical outperformance of smaller caps relative to large-cap companies over time.RELATED:Investing In Quality ETFs That Do Well In Both Good And Bad Markets

236,SWKS,"Apple (AAPL) stock fell 1.7% on Friday after news reports citing GfK data pointed to weak iPhone 7 sales in Europe.Apple shares closed on the stock market today at 112.71, down 1.9% for the week. Apple dipped to 112.25 in after-hours trading.The stock remains above a 110.33 buy point cleared on Sept. 14.Barron's, CNBC and others reported that market research firm GfK put out a note saying first-weekend sales of the iPhone 7 in Europe were down 25% compared with the iPhone 6S launch last year.GfK confirmed the existence of the report, but would not divulge its contents, saying the data was exclusive for subscribers.IBD'S TAKE: Apple isn't the only company affected by iPhone sales. Many semiconductor and component suppliers see their fortunes rise and fall on Apple business. One such chip supplier, Broadcom, is on the IBD 50 list of top-performing companies.Apple broke with its tradition of providing first-weekend iPhone sales this year. It claimed the statistic means little since it is more a factor of supply than demand.In fact, Apple did not have any models of the new iPhone 7 Plus or jet-black models of the standard iPhone 7 in stores at launch on Sept. 16. It quickly sold out of its initial production run of those models during preorders, which began a week earlier.The GfK news also pulled down leading Apple chip suppliers.Broadcom (AVGO) dropped 1.3% to 166.65 on the stock market today. Cirrus Logic (CRUS) tumbled 5.1% to 52.39. Qorvo (QRVO) dipped 2.9% to 54.87. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) slid 2.8% to 74.77.Also weighing on Apple shares Friday was a Reuters report that Japanese regulators are considering taking antitrust action against the technology giant. Regulators are considering charging Apple for possible violations that might have helped it dominate smartphone sales in the country.RELATED:Apple Loses 2% For The Week As Facebook, Alphabet Test Buy PointsIntel Inside iPhone 7; Chipmaker Wins Apple Business
"
237,SWKS,"Helped by unexpectedly high demand for the new iPhone, Apple (AAPL) chip supplier Cirrus Logic (CRUS) over the past week has executed a textbook example of an upside stock reversal.Signs of a reversal include a downturn followed by a quick rebound, often off a key test of support like the 50-day line, with low trading volume on the down days but high volume on the good ones. For intrepid investors, such movement can represent an opportunity to buy at a discount. For others, it can offer a reason to keep calm and not cash out.Cirrus Logic's stock on July 28 jumped nearly 20%, a day after the company reported strong quarterly earnings and gave a forecast that an analyst said suggested more iPhone 7 business from Apple.Cirrus trended higher from there, then began a losing streak on Aug. 22, punctuated by last Friday's 6% dive amid a broader sell-off spurred by Fed rate-hike concerns. But aside from the Sept. 9 drop, the stock's down days during that time saw lower-than-average volume.On Monday, Cirrus initially fell further, but found support at its 50-day line, and reversed higher to close up 2.5% in strong volume. It edged lower Tuesday, again in weak volume, and shot up 4.3% Wednesday and 7.6% Thursday in heavy volume.IBD'S TAKE: As stocks get batted around and concerns persist about stalling growth, learn more about how to navigate a sideways market.Cirrus fell 0.6% to 54.82 on the stock market today in above-average volume but well off session lows.That could be due to profit-taking, as Apple is also down 0.6%, also off Friday's low. Shares of other Apple suppliers like Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) fell 1.2% and 1.4%, respectively, after similarly strong rallies.Friday is also a quadruple witching day, when index options, index futures, stock options and stock futures all expire at the same time, often producing unusual volatility.Still, Cirrus Logic's Relative Strength rating has remained strong, at 97 out of a best-possible 99, and its Accumulation/Distribution rating is B+, indicating net buying by institutional investors.RELATED:Apple Stock Gets Price-Target Hikes As iPhone 7 Goes On Sale Buying Early But Buying Smart With Stock ReversalsSmart Chart Reading: Look For Key Reversals, Shakeouts

238,SWKS,"Apple (AAPL) stock slid Friday on a report that it will continue its reduced production of iPhones in the April-June period in light of sluggish sales.Nikkei Asian Review said it learned of the extension of lower production from parts suppliers who were notified of the plan.Apple fell 2% to 109.85 on the stock market today, falling back below the 200-day moving average. Shares of Apple chip suppliers Broadcom (AVGO), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) traded lower on the news. Broadcom lost 2.1% and Skyworks 2.2%, while Cirrus fell 0.4%.Apple has been dogged by reports of production cutbacks related to slow sales of its flagship iPhone 6S series smartphones.Apple lowered production for the January-March quarter by about 30% from the year-earlier period. And it decided to maintain the reduced output level in the current quarter, Nikkei Asia Review said.Apple has forecast its first year-over-year decline in iPhone unit sales for the March quarter. It is scheduled to report fiscal Q2 results on April 25.On Thursday, investment bank Canaccord Genuity predicted that iPhone sales will decline for three straight quarters before getting a boost from the iPhone 7 launch this fall.RELATED:How Much Will Apple Increase Its Dividend, Stock Buybacks?

Several other top Facebook executives have been regular sellers recently, including COO Sheryl Sandberg.At Facebook's annual F8 Developers Conference this week, the company laid out a 10-year plan that includes initiatives in artificial intelligence, virtual reality, augmented reality and global connectivity.Facebook shares ended Friday with a 0.9% weekly decline but have seen support at their 50-day line. The stock is working on a cup-with-handle base with a 117.09 buy point.Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jen-Hsun Huang disclosed on Thursday a sale and options exercise of 40,000 shares for a transaction total of $1.43 million.The Tesla chip supplier has been on a big run, gaining 13% since breaking out of a base one month ago.Tesla's recently unveiled Model 3 has received higher than anticipated pre-orders, which could mean more cars with Nvidia chips in them.Nvidia shares notched a 4% weekly gain. Tesla saw a 1.8% increase.David Aldrich, CEO at Apple chip supplier Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), on Thursday disclosed a sale and options exercise of 15,000 shares for $1.12 million.Justine Lien, a director at fellow Apple supplier Broadcom (AVGO), sold a little over 4,000 shares for a transaction total of nearly $91,000, according to a disclosure filed Wednesday.The sales came as another Apple supplier, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), warned Thursday that demand for $500 smartphones -- including the iPhone -- has declined.On Friday, the Nikkei Asian Review reported Apple will continue reduced production of iPhones this quarter amid sluggish demand.Despite the warnings, Broadcom is still trading near highs and only lost 0.4% this week. But Skyworks fell 3% and is 33% below its 52-week high.Meanwhile, Apple added 1.1% for the week as it sits 18% below its high, reached last April, and Taiwan Semi rose 0.7%.The banking giant's CFO and COO, Marianne Lake and Matthew Zames, unloaded some shares Thursday after the company's Q1 earnings the day prior beat forecasts.Lake sold nearly 14,000 JPMorgan shares for about $854,000, while Zames sold a little over 45,000 shares for a total of about $2.8 million.JPMorgan shares gapped up after the report but are now hitting resistance at the 200-day line. They rose 7% from a week ago.GoDaddy (GDDY) insiders made significant trades this week. CEO Blake Irving disclosed on Wednesday a sale and options exercise of 50,000 shares for a total of $1.51 million. Other major stakeholders, such as Silver Lake Group, sold millions of shares.GoDaddy failed to break out of a cup-with-handle base at the beginning of the month and has been testing support at the 50-day line. Shares fell 3.1% for the week.Insider transactions don’t typically have a major impact on a stock or indicate major pending news. Rapid liquidation of all or most of an insider’s holdings, however, can affect a stock.

240,SWKS,"Texas Instruments (TXN) joined NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS) late Wednesday, weathering an Apple (AAPL) iPhone shipment dip by bolstering embedded-processing sales to top Wall Street's first-quarter expectations.On Thursday, at least eight analysts boosted their price targets on Texas Instruments stock. On the stock market today, Texas Instruments shares were up a fraction intraday. The stock has been on a run since Jan. 15, climbing 25% after a two-week fall.NXP and Cirrus Logic stocks split the difference in Thursday trading, up 0.2% and down 2.1%, respectively. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) were up 1.6% and 0.3%, respectively, after Apple reported its first ever year-over-year iPhone shipment decline late Tuesday.For the first quarter, Texas Instruments reported $3.01 billion in sales and 65 cents earnings per share, down 5% and up 7%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Both measures topped the consensus of 36 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $2.98 billion and 62 cents.Analog sales -- which includes power management chips used in the iPhone 6S -- declined 8% year over year to $1.88 billion. The drop was expected MKM analyst Ian Ing wrote in a research report. Apple comprised 15% of Texas Instruments' 2015 sales.""While the year-over-year shortfall in smartphones was $150 million, the inclusion of (a) weak PC (segment) results in an even greater shortfall,” he wrote in a research report. ""The year-over-year revenue gap is expected to decline somewhat in June, but still be significant.""Embedded-processing revenue grew 8% vs. the year-earlier quarter to $729 million in sales. Sales of custom integrated circuits drove a 10% year-over-year decline in Texas Instruments' other sales.Texas Instruments' current-quarter guidance for $3.07 billion to $3.33 billion in sales and 67 cents to 77 cents EPS would be flat and down 1%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. But that outlook topped analyst views for $3.18 billion and 71 cents at the midpoints.Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer noted that Texas Instruments is ""consistently executing on consistent execution."" He boosted his price target on Texas Instruments stock to 65 from 60, but reiterated his neutral rating.During Q1, Texas Instruments hit a record 60.6% gross margin. Pitzer and RBC analyst Amit Daryanani expect that to continue, driven by better manufacturing gains, improved mix and impressive execution.Daryanani upped his price target on Texas Instruments stock to 68 from 65, but kept his outperform rating.

NXP topped the chip count, providing three for the machine: the Touch ID second, a controller and a charging component.Two Broadcom chips returned from the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and InvenSense (INVN) and Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) both provided a chip apiece. Apple's A9 processor also made a repeat appearance.Samsung and SK Hynix provided RAM and flash memory chips, respectively.But iFixit was especially enamored by the LG G5, which separates itself from other flagship phones by offering an easily removed -- and therefore replaced -- battery. LG unveiled the device in February.Qualcomm topped the G5 with six chips, including the processor and two power management chips. The chipmaker also supplied charging, audio codec and LTE transceiver chips.Broadcom and Skyworks Solutions each provided two chips, leading NXP, which supplied a controller. LG tapped Samsung for both RAM and flash memory.On the stock market today, shares of Qualcomm and NXP 0.9% and 0.3%, respectively. Shares of Maxim and Broadcom both lost 0.35%, while Skyworks stock skidded 1.7%. Apple rose 0.3%.

242,SWKS,"Stocks ceded some ground Wednesday, as a mix of earnings reports and an uptick in oil prices stirred the morning's trade.The Dow and the S&P 500 slipped 0.2% each. The Nasdaq tumbled 0.9%.Earnings action drove volume higher, up 17% on the NYSE and 13% on the Nasdaq compared with the same time Tuesday.Earnings reports were the clear early driver, but the stock market today is also looking toward this afternoon's policy decision from the Federal Open Market Committee. The announcement is set for 2 p.m. ET.The U.S. trade deficit narrowed to $56.9 billion in March, down from February's $62.9 deficit and besting estimates for $62.6 billion. Exports declined 1.7%, the Commerce Department reported, vs. a 2% increase in February. Imports fell 4.4%, reversing the prior month's 1.6% increase.The National Association of Realtors reported pending home sales increased by 1.4% in March, a serious downshift from growth of 3.5% in February -- but still better than the 0.5% increase economists had forecast.United Technologies (UTX) topped the Dow, up 1.5% after Q1 earnings and revenue topped analyst consensus views. Nike (NKE) sagged to the bottom of the index, down 0.8%.Check out Nike's standing in its industry group using IBD's Stock Checkup.The Nasdaq was a focal battlefield, with Apple (AAPL) down 7% after its earnings and revenue missed fiscal Q2 analyst estimates. A handful of analyst downgrades to the stock rolled out this morning.  Also among Nasdaq 100 stocks, C.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW) dropped 6% as an analyst downgrade followed a mixed Q1 report delivered late Tuesday.Apple chip suppliers shook off premarket losses and posted mixed results after the open, as Cirrus Logic (CRUS) punched up 6% after reporting  fiscal Q4 results late Tuesday. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) rose more than 1%. Broadcom (AVGO) added 0.8%. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) lagged with a 0.6% loss.Network services provider Akamai Technologies (AKAM) sparked up 9% in heavy trade.  It reported a third quarter of strengthening earnings as EPS and revenue growth topped analysts' forecasts. The gain put shares back above the stock's 200-day moving average, though it remains deep in a consolidation.EBay (EBAY) belted out a 6% gain. The online auctioneer and retailer reported earnings and revenue above consensus estimates, but guided Q2 EPS below expectations. The stock is testing resistance at its 40-week moving average, attempting to climb the right side of a four-month-old consolidation.

243,SWKS,"The S&P 500's often-solid, always-hyped tech sector is set for its steepest quarterly earnings drop since the recession, with weakness in Apple (AAPL) and legacy tech giants overshadowing gains in newer leaders like Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB).The rest of the S&P 500's first quarter? Overall earnings for companies in the bellwether index were expected as of Tuesday to fall 7.1% from a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters, which would mark the biggest drop since Q3 2009 and the third straight quarter of accelerating declines.Revenue is forecast to slip 1.1%, potentially the fifth consecutive slide but not as bad as prior declines.The forecast for a tech earnings drop of 5.5% would be the sharpest since the last quarter of the Great Recession in Q2 2009. It comes as Apple contends with weaker iPhone demand and concerns about waning interest in its new products.Apple's earnings are seen falling 14%. By comparison, Facebook's should jump 48%, and Alphabet's are expected to climb 21%.The iPhone's demand woes don't stop at Apple. Suppliers like Skyworks (SWKS) should suffer too, and analysts are forecasting the chip maker's earnings growth will slow to 8% from 27%. Broadcom's (AVGO) earnings growth is seen decelerating for the fourth straight quarter.Meanwhile, big players in hardware are trying to shift to mobile tech, the cloud, artificial intelligence and data analytics, with the transition weighing on results.Weakness in international economies -- China is slowing, Russia is hurting, Brazil is drowning in recession and a widespread bribery scandal -- have also hurt the tech sector. And the industry has been particularly sensitive to belt-tightening in the U.S.""The likes of IBM (IBM) and Oracle (ORCL) and Cisco (CSCO) and Microsoft (MSFT) -- all of these guys suffer when corporate America does not spend on upgrading its infrastructure and its servers, its computers, and its applications,"" Sheraz Mian, director of research at Zacks, told IBD.But the earnings weakness in Q1 looks to be broad, as 7 of the 10 sectors tracked by Thomson Reuters are expected to show declines. The roughly 4-to-1 ratio of negative earnings preannouncements vs. positive ones is worse than in typical quarters.Energy remains under pressure, and the sector is expected to swing to its first loss since at least 2002. Excluding energy, earnings would improve to a 2% drop. Revenue excluding energy would creep up by 1.9%.“The economy here is not growing fast,” Thomson Reuters analyst Greg Harrison told IBD. “A lot of the companies in the S&P 500 are kind of dependent on international markets for growth, and that’s slowing down.”The dollar, which has generally been stronger against other currencies, has also weighed on results despite recent weakening.Earnings in the materials sector are on track to fall 19.9%. The reasons are the usual ones: Many companies overexpanded through debt to unearth more of the planet's resources, which China didn't need as its economy softened. Now mining companies like BHP Billiton (BHP) are picking up the pieces.First-quarter earnings for the finance sector are projected to fall 6.9%, with the Federal Reserve's more dovish stance toward rate hikes this year less likely to cushion banks' net interest margins.On the bright side, earnings for the consumer discretionary segment are seen climbing 13.3%. Those gains would be led by Amazon (AMZN), reflecting e-commerce's increasing popularity, and Ford (F), which along with other automakers has benefited from lower gas prices.Homebuilders are also set to do well, with cheaper land bought during the financial crisis helping margins now, Harrison said.But while American consumers are propping up much of the U.S. economy, China remains the issue for the index broadly.Mian noted that many companies had invested heavily in China in the last 10-15 years, often highlighting their spending as big selling points.

245,SWKS,"Apple’s (AAPL) new iPhone SE probably has a gross profit margin of about 35% for the entry-level model, which is well below the mid-40% margins enjoyed by the rest of the iPhone family, RBC Capital Markets said in a research report Thursday.But the new phone, which starts at $399, will still give a lift to revenue and profit, RBC analyst Amit Daryanani said in the report.The iPhone SE could provide $6.8 billion in revenue and 23 cents in earnings per share this calendar year, assuming Apple sells an incremental 15 million units, Daryanani said.He reiterated his outperform rating on Apple stock, with a price target of 130. Apple was down a fraction, below 109, in morning trading on the stock market today.Based on teardown reports, the 16-gigabyte model iPhone SE has a bill of materials cost of about $260, Daryanani said. The 4-inch iPhone uses many of the same components found in the larger-screen, higher-priced iPhone 6 and 6S series phones.The iPhone SE likely benefited from cheaper components that were the result of Apple suppliers left with excess inventory after the iPhone 6S underperformed, he said.Chipmakers Qualcomm (QCOM) and Qorvo (QRVO) topped content in the iPhone SE, but Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Texas Instruments (TXN) gained new chips in the refreshed 4-inch smartphone, a Chipworks teardown found.The iPhone SE went on sale Thursday. It was a low-key product launch for Apple, with few stores seeing lines forming outside, Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said in a report Thursday.Also, a check of 100 Apple stores in the U.S. found 90% availability for the iPhone SE, he said.“We view both the lack of lines and the high level of product availability as in line with expectations, reinforcing our view that the SE will be largely incremental to the model in replacing the low-end iPhone 5S,” Munster said.RELATED:Middle-Aged Apple Might Get A Sports Car, New Girlfriend.

246,SWKS,"Chipmakers Qualcomm (QCOM) and Qorvo (QRVO) topped content in Apple’s (AAPL) newly launched iPhone SE, but Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Texas Instruments (TXN) gained new chips in the 4-inch smartphone, a Chipworks teardown found Thursday.Apple's iPhone SE is ""the most powerful 4-inch phone ever,"" the smartphone giant says. It was unveiled March 21 and began shipping today, the same day Tesla Motors (TSLA) began taking orders for its less expensive Model 3.Researchers with Chipworks and iFixit classified the iPhone SE, the first to not have a number in its name, as the iPhone 6S squeezed into the iPhone 5S body.""There are very few new parts, but that hardly means there is no innovation,"" Chipworks wrote. But Apple engaged in ""serious economical re-use"" of many radio-frequency (RF) chips, excepting the Skyworks and Texas Instruments additions.New to the iPhone SE, Skyworks gained a power amplifier module and Texas Instruments earned a power management chip. Privately-held Toshiba and Epcos made new appearances with a flash-memory chip and an antenna switch module.A new power management chip could also be an Apple-Dialog Semiconductor mash-up, Chipworks wrote.Qualcomm and Qorvo each have four chips in the phone, leading Skyworks, which contributed three iPhone SE chips. Broadcom (AVGO) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS) each supplied two chips. Texas Instruments, NXP Semiconductor (NXPI) and InvenSense (INVN) all brought one apiece to the table.The A9 processor was supplied by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), in this particular phone. But Apple dual-sourced the A9 in the iPhone 6S, splitting share between Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung.Samsung reportedly has since said that it would yield the A10 processor to Taiwan Semiconductor. The A10 processor is scheduled to make its debut in the iPhone 7, likely to be launched in September.
"
247,SWKS,"Apple (AAPL) supplier Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) ought to acquire Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) to diversify from the slowing smartphone and radio-frequency market, Pacific Crest analyst Michael McConnell suggested Thursday.Maxim has long been takeover bait with sharks Analog Devices (ADI) and Texas Instruments (TXN) reportedly eyeing the $10.5 billion-market-cap chipmaker in October. But sources told Bloomberg that Maxim might not sell without a high premium.Skyworks could provide that premium, McConnell wrote in a research report. Maxim stock rose a fraction Thursday, to 36.78. Skyworks was flat. An offer of $44 per share would be a 20% premium to Maxim stock, McConnell points out.Acquiring Maxim would help Skyworks diversify beyond its 80% exposure to the struggling mobile market, McConnell wrote. Maxim has ties to the data center and automotive markets.Though Maxim makes the most sense -- McConnell rates both a buy -- Skyworks could also diversify by acquiring Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI) or Silicon Laboratories (SLAB), McConnell wrote.RF, Skyworks' bread and butter, is slated for a compound annual growth rate of 11% over the next several years vs. historical 18% growth, McConnell wrote. Skyworks competes in the RF ring with Broadcom (AVGO) and Qorvo (QRVO), both Apple suppliers.The number of bands -- a spectrum of RF -- rocketed between 2005 and 2015, Brent Dietz, Qorvo director of corporate communications, told IBD. In 2005, there were two bands. By 2015, there were 43.McConnell sees little opportunity for continued band acceleration. And Dietz offered a similar growth view for the RF market -- a $10 billion market opportunity with a 10%-15% growth rate.But Dietz notes that the RF content in smartphones has gapped up this century. Less complex 2G phones had about 80 cents worth of RF content. Today, most smartphones have about $16 worth of RF.To that point, Broadcom's mobile RF content grows in excess of 20% every year, CEO Hock Tan said during the company's Q1 earnings conference call. He expects 2016 to be no different.This year, Qorvo and Skyworks offered similar views of growing dollar content in marquee smartphones. Recent teardowns show that Samsung completely replaced three Skyworks chips in its Galaxy S7 and that Qorvo twice replaced Broadcom.

The Nasdaq backed off a fraction.Volume ticked slightly higher, up 17% on the NYSE and up a fraction on the Nasdaq relative to trade at the same time Monday.A speech scheduled just after midday in New York from Yellen, followed by a question and answer period, provides the centerpiece of the stock market today.In early economic news, home prices popped 5.8% year-over-year in January according to the S&P/Case-Shiller 20-City Composite Home Price Index. Portland, Ore., Seattle and San Francisco logged the biggest increases.  The gain was in line with economists consensus projections.Consumer outlooks improved in March, lifting the Conference Board's Consumer Sentiment Index to 96.2, a big jump above February's 92.2 reading and easily clearing consensus views for 94.Oil prices continued lower, dropping 3% and putting West Texas Intermediate just above $38 a barrel.  Oil and energy related stocks packed into the low end of the S&P 500.Boeing (BA) dropped nearly 2%, the worst slip among Dow stocks. Chevron (CVX) and 3M (MMM) were also down more than 1%. At the top of the index, McDonald's (MCD) climbed almost 1%.Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) dropped 3% to the bottom of the Nasdaq 100.

250,SWKS,"Intel's (INTC) dogged mobile pursuit -- to the tune of ""billions of dollars"" lost -- will pay off with an Apple (AAPL) iPhone 7 modem chip, a Barclays analyst wrote Monday as he downgraded modem rival Qualcomm (QCOM).Radio-frequency systems supplier Qorvo (QRVO) wins in the Intel model, scooping rival Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis wrote in a research report. But Intel's Apple iPhone share will likely be a minority, with 10%-20%, as a second source.The No. 1 chipmaker Intel hasn't been used in an iPhone since the 2008 3G iteration. Apple last dual-sourced a key component -- the processor -- in the iPhone 6S, pitting Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) against Samsung.Samsung has since backed off the A10 processor, yielding to Taiwan Semiconductor, analysts say.Midday on the stock market today, Qualcomm stock was down more than 1.5%, while shares of Intel and Apple were little changed. Skyworks stock was up 0.8%, while Qorvo stock was down 0.4%.Figuring on 20% share of the iPhone 7, Intel would add 3 cents earnings per share ex items per quarter vs. a 13-cent Qualcomm decline, Curtis wrote. Curtis downgraded Qualcomm stock to equal weight from sector weight and cut his price target to 50 from 55.""We clearly underestimated Intel's ability to lose billions of dollars in this pursuit of mobile, but we also thought Qualcomm would make a larger effort to monetize the modem business it still has,"" Curtis wrote.Qualcomm likely won't be able to innovate back to 100% share of the iPhone modem business, Curtis wrote. Its faster modem, the Snapdragon 820, comes with a lower average sales price and higher costs.""If Qualcomm can't fix that problem, then this would be bad business for both companies unfortunately,"" Curtis wrote.On the radio-frequency side, Qorvo wins in the Intel model, gaining 3% share vs. its iPhone 6S offerings, he wrote. In an 80%/20% Qualcomm-Intel split, Qorvo gets a pair of power amplifiers and the envelope tracking chip, undercutting Skyworks.Curtis forecasts Qorvo's iPhone 7 share to rise 3% to $4.92 vs. $4.80 in the iPhone 6S. He boosted his price target on Qorvo stock to 50 from 46.But even at 50% penetration for Intel, which he calls unlikely, Skyworks still gains share, Curtis wrote. At the 80%/20% split, he expects Skyworks' iPhone 7 chip content to rise as much as 20% to $6.82 per phone, up from $5.69 in the 6s.Curtis sees Broadcom's (AVGO) contribution growing 27% in the iPhone 7 to $8.05 worth of content, vs. $6.35 in iPhone 6S. A three-year supply agreement between Broadcom and Apple will likely leave Qorvo, Skyworks and Japan's Murata Manufacturing scrambling for share, he wrote.

253,SWKS,"Apple (AAPL), Samsung and other smartphone makers will need more advanced chips and antenna components as wireless service providers combine multiple radio-frequency bands to improve network capacity and data speeds, says a Citigroup report.AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ)and Sprint (S) are among the wireless firms turning to “carrier aggregation,” a term for combining two or more frequency bands to provide a single communications channel with more bandwidth.This juggling act requires more complex radio frequency chips, says Citigroup. It forecasts a growing market opportunity for chipmakers Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS),  Qorvo (QRVO), Murata and others.Wireless firms are using carrier aggregation as mobile video traffic surges.  “Carrier aggregation is like adding more lanes to widen the highway and creating more space for more cars to travel on the highway at the same time,” says the report.While Apple designs its own antennas, there’s still a market opportunity for Amphenol and AAC Technologies to supply China-based smartphone brands, says Citigroup.Apple’s iPhone 6S series supports 23 frequency bands and the number is expected to keep growing in future devices, says Citigroup. Xiaomi’s new Mi 5 supports carrier aggregation to double its data download speeds, says the report.In the U.S., AT&T was the first to move to carrier aggregation for 4G LTE-A network upgrades, followed by Sprint and Verizon, analysts say.“According to Cisco (CSCO) (Systems), mobile data traffic is expected to grow more than 50% in the next five years,” said Citigroup. It expects more “world” phones to be built, with the ability to roam on 4G LTE networks as subscribers travel.

254,SWKS,"A new U.S. export ban against Chinese mobile gear maker ZTE related to its under-the-table sales to Iran could hurt Apple (AAPL) chip suppliers Qualcomm (QCOM), Qorvo (QRVO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), a Pacific Crest analyst wrote Wednesday.Regulators imposed the sanctions Tuesday, alleging that ZTE used four shell companies in China and Iran to ""illicitly re-export controlled items to Iran in violation of U.S. export control laws."" The ban prohibits U.S. companies from selling to ZTE.Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi opposed the sanctions, saying that ZTE's tech purchases support thousands of U.S. jobs, according to the AP. Chipmakers Cavium (CAVM), Integrated Device Technology (IDTI), Silicon Laboratories (SLAB) and Xilinx (XLNX) also sell to ZTE.""This approach will only hurt others without necessarily benefiting oneself,"" Yi said at a new conference Tuesday.ZTE isn't banned from selling products in the U.S. but cannot procure components from U.S. companies. U.S. firms can apply for an export license, but Pacific Crest analyst John Vinh sees the government unlikely to grant them.The development could shuffle the smartphone market. ZTE owns about 4% of the global smartphone market, Vinh wrote. Industry tracker IDC says that ZTE competes alongside Xiaomi and Huawei in the low-end to midrange smartphone market, vs. No. 1 smartphone vendor Samsung.Vinh expects short-term effects on chipmakers to be ""negligible."" Longer term, he says that ZTE could lose share to Huawei, Ericsson (ERIC), Alcatel-Lucent (ALU), Nokia (NOK), Siemens (SIEGY), Xiaomi, Oppo and Lenovo.""Alternatively, ZTE could conform to the U.S. embargo list, which could result in sanctions being lifted,"" he wrote.Xilinx is most at risk, with 3%-3.5% of total revenue stemming from sales to ZTE, Vinh estimates. Silicon Labs follows with 2%-2.5% of total revenue wrapped in ZTE sales.IDT, Qualcomm and Qorvo are each 2% tied to ZTE, Cavium 1%-2%, and about 1.5% of Skyworks' sales stem from the Chinese smartphone maker.Wall Street largely yawned Wednesday, however. Midday on the stock market today, only Qualcomm stock was down, dipping a fraction. Cavium stock was up a fraction. Shares of Qorvo, Silicon Labs, Skyworks and Xilinx were all up more than 1%. Integrated Device Technology stock was up more than 2.5%.

255,SWKS,"Apple (AAPL) supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) quintupled its content in the Samsung Galaxy S7 smartphone as radio frequency-chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) repeatedly lost share to rival Qorvo (QRVO), a ChipWorks teardown shows.The ChipWorks teardown was last week, but it was highlighted in a research report Monday by Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill.InvenSense (INVN), another Apple supplier, apparently lost the GS7 gyroscope to STMicroelectronics (STM). InvenSense stock was down 1.5% in midday trading on the stock market today. STMicro stock was up a fraction.Three Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) chips were completely replaced in the GS7.Key winners in getting their chips inside the new phone, besides Qualcomm and Qorvo, included NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM).Although Broadcom retained a power amplifier, rival Qorvo swiped two Broadcom components from the GS7. But Broadcom replaced a Skyworks multiband module (a power amplifier).Last week, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan bragged that the chipmaker has increased its content by 20% every year for its ""North American customer,"" which analysts said is the Apple iPhone, and that another bump is expected with the release of the next iPhone, the iPhone 7, due out in September. Meanwhile, though, Broadcom is de-emphasizing its mobile unit, which will comprise 23% of Q2 sales, down from 32% in Q1, as smartphone shipments slow amid a saturated market.Samsung lowered its own chip content in the GS7 vs. the GS6. Qualcomm took four chips (including the application processor) from Samsung and replaced Cirrus Logic (CRUS)/Wolfson on an audio chip. SK Hynix, NXP and Maxim each replaced a Samsung component.But Samsung swapped STMicroelectronics' touch controller in the GS6 for its own controller in the GS7.And Texas Instruments (TXN) lost the wireless power receiver to Integrated Device Technology (IDTI).

256,SWKS,"Stocks kept to positive territory midday Friday as the market cranked up the volume. Trade was up about 15% on the Nasdaq and 20% on the NYSE vs. the previous session's pace.The Nasdaq pegged a 0.4% gain, as did the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average. The small-cap S&P 600 rose 0.9%, but the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index led the major averages with a 1.5% surge in the stock market today.Blue chips were almost evenly split between winners and losers on the Dow industrials. For the eighth day in a row, Caterpillar (CAT) stepped higher -- near midday, the stock was up 2% in volume 75% above average.Caterpillar is bumping up against resistance at its 200-day line. The stock retook its 50-day line in February. The company's revenue has declined vs. the year-earlier level for five consecutive quarters.Among stocks in the surging Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, Broadcom (AVGO) jumped 7% as it cleared a 138.79 buy point in a double-bottom base. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) advanced 5%, though it remains 34% below its June high. Qorvo (QRVO) added 3% as it headed toward an eighth straight gain.Crude oil and gold were each up more than 1%.
"
257,SWKS,"Stocks rose and were near session highs in afternoon trading Friday after a quiet start. The Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average all showed gains of about 0.5%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking higher in the stock market today, compared to Thursday's levels.A better-than-expected February jobs report didn't stir much excitement at the open. The U.S. economy added 242,000 jobs in February, well above the consensus estimate of 190,000. The unemployment rate held steady at 4.9%.Smith & Wesson (SWHC) and Broadcom (AVGO) were the earnings stars of the day, with gains of 7% each. Smith & Wesson continues to see strong demand for its firearms fueled by fears of future gun regulation. Meanwhile, Broadcom benefited from several positive analyst comments. Broadcom was one of the top gainers in the Nasdaq 100, along with other chip names like Skyworks (SWKS), NXP (NXPI) and Micron (MU).MaxLinear (MXL), the sole IBD Sector Leader at this point, continued its winning ways, rising another 4% to a 52-week high. It's a bit extended from a 17.29 double-bottom entry, but its weekly chart shows that it's still in the early stages of breaking out over a 17.85 buy point, a legitimate alternate entry.Movie theater operator Carmike (CKEC) jumped 16% after NYSE-listed AMC Entertainment (AMC) announced plans to buy the firm for around $1.1 billion, including some debt. The deal values Carmike at around 30 a share. AMC was purchased in 2012 by China’s Dalian Wanda Group Co. for $2.6 billion. Shares of AMC Entertainment rose 3%.Elsewhere, little-known financial name Home Bancshares (HOMB), which shows three straight quarters of accelerating earnings and sales growth, continued work on the right side of a base. Shares gained 3%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

258,SWKS,"Chinese hackers had already roamed Nortel's systems for nearly 10 years when, five years after the breach discovery, business communications firm Avaya acquired bankrupt Nortel Enterprise Solutions -- and, unknowingly, also acquired that company's attackers.That was a bellwether moment for the M&A world, says Caleb Barlow, IBM (IBM) vice president of security. Until then, an acquisition target's cybersecurity situation wasn't a box on the usual M&A checklist.""It was the moment everyone in the M&A community woke up,"" Barlow told IBD. ""They said, 'We better be looking at their security posture as well, otherwise you could not only legitimately acquire the company, but also the attacker.""As Barlow recounts, Nortel's downfall came down to seven passwords, including the chief executive officer's. Hackers with Chinese IP addresses gained access to Nortel's network as early as 2000 and so thoroughly dug in that they weren't discovered until 2004.Avaya, which acquired that Nortel business for $900 million in 2009, didn't learn of the breach until after its acquisition closed. And even then, the hackers were still entrenched in the system.""No one had really thought about this type of problem before because cybersecurity wasn't one of the normal things you'd think about in the M&A process,"" Barlow said. ""In my view, it's now a critical component.""Consulting firm Deloitte found 70% of 2,500 firms surveyed in 2015 considered security to be a ""high"" or ""very high"" priority in M&As. That's up from 64% in 2014. Both corporate and private equity respondents increased their due diligence efforts over the span of the year.But also in the 2014 Deloitte survey, 78% of firms said security wasn't a general piece of M&A due diligence, and 66% said rapid-fire M&A bidding made cyber risks ""very difficult"" to quickly quantify. Deloitte didn't reiterate those questions in its 2015 survey.Rapid-fire M&As include Apple (AAPL) chip supplier Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Microsemi (MSCC) last year facing off in a month-long bidding battle for PMC-Sierra (PMCS).Due diligence might or might not have been rushed in that deal, but such aggressive bidding wars are infrequent, Fortinet (FTNT) CFO Drew Del Matto told IBD. More often, an acquirer examines a target's products, financials, policies and systems. IT security is just a new layer of the necessary due diligence.This mindset is new, and there are built-in risks with every piece of due diligence, NSS Labs CEO Vikram Phatak says. NSS Labs independently tests and reports on the efficiency of cybersecurity products, similar to Consumer Reports.It's likely an acquirer has ""a really good handle on the debt the company will have, the expense structure of the company, the historical growth rates,"" he told IBD. ""Where you get a little sticky is they may not have time to do all the (security-related) due diligence by calling the customers.""Cybersecurity works along the same lines, Phatak says. Tech companies, especially, should have a keen understanding of the security measures in place, BitSight CTO Stephen Boyer told IBD. BitSight rates the cybersecurity posture of about 40,000 companies, similar to a FICO score, so customers can assess their own security risk but also the risks of potential or current partners, vendors and customers.""If you go in and say, 'Who's in charge of this (security)?' and everyone looks around, then you probably have a problem,"" Boyer said.Even including cybersecurity within due diligence isn't a surefire protection, Boyer said. Former telecom provider Pacnet discovered a breach on April 3, 2015, after Telstra finalized its $697 million acquisition of Pacnet.Telstra was notified on April 16 -- the day the merger completed. An SQL code injection on a Pacnet Web service application server opened hackers to the network, email and administrative processes.Acquirers should be ""monitoring that window of due diligence up until the week the deal closes,"" Boyer said. ""Monitor it all through the process, because there would be a slip-up along the way.""Before signing off on a merger, an acquirer should get a sense of the target's cybersecurity culture, Barlow says. Examine past incidents -- processes, logs and reports. If those documents aren't available, then there might be a problem.That goes double for a tech company.""If they don't have those policies in place, then you start asking other questions,"" Barlow said. ""If they weren't paying attention to security, what else weren't they looking at?""Phatak suggests acquirers also scope out a target's security vendors. Not every cybersecurity vendor is built the same and the quality of a target's security purchases can be very telling, he told IBD.""Make sure the company you're acquiring didn't skimp on security,"" he said. ""(Products) are not all equal, but from a compliance perspective, a check-box perspective, they all look the same.""Del Matto estimates two-thirds of breaches come from the inside, at the hands of either careless or disgruntled employees. M&A, often accompanied by layoffs, can breed the latter.""When people feel like they're at risk, they're more likely to do something that may expose the company to a cyber risk,"" Del Matto said. More benign actions, like inadvertently visiting an infected website, can lead to malware attaching on the system.But Del Matto is more concerned about the damage a disgruntled employee with absolute access can wreak. Barlow suggests a company identify its ""crown jewel"" and then tuck it into a protected place with limited access.That crown jewel could be IP, financial information, client lists, personal information -- basically anything worth stealing, Phatak told IBD.""If someone is able to get into the customer list, they could see what deals are in the (pipeline),"" Del Matto said. ""They may monetize those by selling them or, worse, leaving the company with those lists in their hands.""Beyond guarding that data, an M&A-engaged company should embrace employees into the new culture, he said. Because, ""when you buy a company, you buy a competitive advantage. If that leaks out in some other way, you're destroying the value of the M&A.""
"
259,SWKS,"Broadcom (AVGO) CEO Hock Tan satisfied querying minds Thursday, claiming that further M&A following the $37 billion merger with fellow Apple (AAPL) supplier Avago Technologies is ""furthest from our minds at this point.""Top-line growth will slow to 5% in the long term as Broadcom digests Avago, MKM analyst Ian Ing wrote today in a research report. But the merged company's diversification -- which puts wired sales on top -- will help offset a wireless trough in Q2, he said.Ing retained his buy rating and boosted his price target to 162 from 160 on Broadcom stock, which was up 7%, around 147, in afternoon trading on the stock market today, touching a 2016 high.For its fiscal Q1 ended Jan. 1 -- before the completed Feb. 1 merger -- Broadcom late Thursday reported non-GAAP figures of $2.41 earnings per share on $1.78 billion in sales, up 15% and 8%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter.The consensus estimates of 30 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were $2.30 and $1.75 billion.Current-quarter sales ex items guidance for $3.55 billion at the midpoint was slightly off the consensus model for $3.75 billion. Unlike Q1 figures, Q2 sales reflect the combined Avago-Broadcom company, Tan said on the company's earnings conference call.Pacific Crest analyst John Vinh credited Broadcom's 11-cent Q1 EPS beat to $30 million to $40 million in acquisition-related synergies. In total, Broadcom expects $750 million in synergies over 18 months. FBR analyst Christopher Rolland sees Broadcom exceeding that $750 million target.As Broadcom looks to shed smaller business units, the chipmaker expects to reduce quarterly operating expenses by $80 million. For the April quarter, Broadcom guided to $832 million in op-ex, below the consensus for $944 million, Ing wrote.Wired sales are expected to comprise 55% of Q2 revenue, leading wireless, enterprise storage and industrial sales at 23%, 17% and 5% of sales, respectively. The expectations flip Q1 results, where enterprise storage sales led with 38% of total revenue. Wireless, wired and industrial contributed 32%, 22% and 8%, respectively.During Q1, strong enterprise storage sales helped offset a 15% sequential decline in the wireless segment, Tan said. Wireless sales fell on wavering Apple iPhone demand, despite Samsung's Galaxy 7S ramp-up, but Tan expects to increase Broadcom's iPhone 7 content by 20%-plus after Q2.""Despite weaker-than-expected Q1 iPhone builds that have weighed on the entire Apple supply chain, Broadcom not only maintained its full-year RF (radio frequency) growth forecast, but raised it,"" Rolland wrote.Rolland maintained his outperform rating and 185 price target on Broadcom stock. Vinh rates Broadcom stock as overweight and has a 170 price target.Shares of fellow Apple suppliers Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Qorvo (QRVO) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS) were up a respective 6%, 5%, 3% and 2% in afternoon trading Friday, after Broadcom's Q1 earnings.

260,SWKS,"Stocks quickly reversed thin gains into narrow losses on Friday, despite strong jobs February data and positive overseas action.The Nasdaq slipped 0.2%. The Dow and S&P 500 dipped 0.1% apiece. Volume rose sharply: up 26% on the NYSE and 33% higher on the Nasdaq.Early indicators showed no clear signals from industry group action after the open. Most major factors appeared positive for the stock market today. Bonds and the dollar slipped. Overseas markets, quarterly earnings reports and February payrolls data all contributed some lift.  The Nasdaq opened tracking toward a 2.6% rise for the week and back above its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 showed a 2.3% gain, nearing a test of resistance at its 200-day average after retaking its 50-day line in the prior week. Both indexes are working on their third straight weekly advance.Nonfarm employers expanded their payrolls by 242,000 workers in February, more than 40% above the Labor Department's upwardly revised January tally and 52,000 paychecks above consensus expectations. Private employers provided almost all the muscle, adding 230,000 jobs vs. estimates of 183,000.The trade deficit widened slightly in January to $45.7 billion, the Commerce Department reported, above an upwardly revised $44.7 billion in December. Economist consensus projected a decrease to $43.9 billion.Oil prices rose mildly, with West Texas Intermediate up 0.5% to near $35 a barrel -- up almost 6% for the week. Europe's Brent crude benchmark added 0.8%, trading above $37 -- more than 6% above its settle price last Friday. Oil prices often show some response to data released in Baker Hughes (BHI) weekly rig count report, which is due out at 1 p.m. ET.Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kaplan is also scheduled to speak at 1 p.m.Dow stocks opened with a slightly upward bias, then reversed course in early trade. Apple (AAPL) topped the group with a 0.5% gain.  Intel (INTC) staked out the low end, slipping 1.4% in light trade.Broadcom (AVGO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and JD.com (JD) led the Nasdaq 100.IBD 50 stock Broadcom ramped up nearly 5% in heavy trade, clearing a 138.79 buy point by nearly 4%. The chip developer turned in healthy fiscal Q1 results after Thursday's close.Ignite Restaurant (IRG) took the Nasdaq 100's hardest hit, down more than 17% after a deeper-than-expected Q4 loss.Smith & Wesson (SWHC) fired off an 8% gain in fast trade. That put the firearms brand nearly 3% past a 26.64 buy point in a cup base. Fiscal Q3 results, reported after Thursday's close, were well above analyst consensus views. Peer Sturm Ruger (RGR) -- also on the IBD 50 list -- caught some of the updraft and rose 3%.On the downside, Cal-Maine Foods (CALM) dropped more than 6% in big volume after a downgrade, to underweight from hold, from BB&T Capital.   
"
261,SWKS,"Broadcom (AVGO) stock gapped up to a 2016 high at the open Friday, after the Apple (AAPL) chip supplier late Thursday topped Wall Street's fiscal Q1 earnings-per-share expectations by 11 cents and issued Q2 guidance that edged analyst forecasts.Broadcom CEO Hock Tan hinted that Broadcom is already ramping for the likely September release of Apple's iPhone 7. He acknowledged that wireless demand declined 15% sequentially in Q1 on typical seasonality haunting ""our North American customer"" (i.e. Apple).Tan isn't alone. Last month, fellow Apple supplier Qorvo (QRVO) guided to weak Q4 sales, tugging Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS) into a hole. But Tan expects Q2 to be the year's ""trough.""Broadcom stock was up 7% in early trading on the stock market today, above 146, on the fiscal Q1 beat, which followed the finalized acquisition of Broadcom by the former Avago Technologies on Feb. 1. The Q1 results relate solely to the former Avago, according to the company release, as the quarter ended Jan. 31, just before the deal was finalized.For fiscal Q1, Broadcom reported non-GAAP figures of $2.41 earnings per share on $1.78 billion in sales, up 15% and 8%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Both measures topped the consensus of 30 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $2.30 and $1.75 billion.During Q1, wired and enterprise storage sales grew 2% and 6%, respectively, on a sequential basis. Industrial sales fell 10% sequentially, trailing the 15% decline in wireless sales, Tan told analysts on the conference call.""Last year, we had unusually high demand in Q1 from a North American customer which offset normal seasonality,"" he said. ""This year, however -- as we all know -- seasonality returned and there was a product life cycle demand decline from that specific customer.""This week IDC issued a smartphone forecast that sees iPhone shipments declining 0.1% this year as smartphones running Alphabet's (GOOGL) Android operating system rise 7.6%.Tan said on Broadcom's conference call that he expects weak smartphone demand to reverse in the second half of 2016.Enterprise storage comprises 38% of the former Avago's total Q1 revenue -- the largest segment and leading wireless sales which contributed 32% to the total pot. But, the wired segment is growing and during the April quarter will bring in 55% of sales, Tan said.The midpoint of current-quarter guidance for $3.55 billion in sales on a non-GAAP basis, plus or minus $75 million, nearly touched the consensus model for $3.57 billion. Current-quarter sales views reflect the combined Avago-Broadcom company.During Q2, wireless and enterprise storage sales will shrink as chunks of total sales to 23% and 17%, respectively, Tan said. Still, all eyes are on Broadcom's ""North American customer"" which increased the chipmaker's RF content in its upcoming flagship smartphone, he said.""We are already pre-building significant quantities of our RF chips"" for the second-half of 2016 ramp, he said. ""We increase our RF content by 20% year after year in this high-end smartphone market.""But Tan expects greater strength in the wired segment where Broadcom expects to add new products. The segment will also benefit from increased enterprise demand.In May 2015, the former Avago announced a $37 billion bid for fellow Apple supplier Broadcom, kicking off a record-busting year of consolidation in the semiconductor industry amid macro weakness, slowing growth and ramping costs.Post-merger, the company retained Broadcom's name and Avago's ticker symbol ""AVGO."" Broadcom is one of two chipmakers on the IBD 50 list of top-rated growth stocks. The other is Tesla Motors (TSLA) partner Nvidia (NVDA).

Two chipmakers that work in connected cars and self-driving cars on the IBD 50 list of leading growth stocks rose in the stock market today: Nvidia (NVDA), which is also a Tesla partner, and Broadcom (AVGO). Both companies serve a variety of fields and are Apple (AAPL) suppliers.Automakers talked up some of the technology in car debuts at this week's Geneva International Motor Show -- such as Daimler (DDAIF) with a Mercedes-Benz E-Class that can brake and park itself. Tesla's also there, showing off its Model X crossover SUV.Nvidia, which counts Tesla and Mercedes among more than 50 carmaker partners, surged 4.4% Tuesday. Broadcom gained 3.3%, ahead of its Thursday afternoon earnings report. Broadcom stock has been consolidating and is about 8% under a buy point, while Nvidia is about 4% away and has just formed a cup base.Mobileye gets a 62 Composite Rating from IBD. Nvidia gets a best-possible 99 and Broadcom a 98.

263,SWKS,"It's looking like Christmas for chipmaker stock ETFs. Figuratively speaking, of course.With some stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA) and MaxLinear (MXL) showing stock market leadership and others near buy points, semiconductor ETFs are in the spotlight for investors.And Santa may be bringing goodies in the way of new iPhones, iPads and even -- Hallelujah! -- a mass-market Model 3 electric vehicle. Apple (AAPL) and Tesla Motors (TSLA) are expected to debut these hotly awaited products on March 21 and March 31, respectively.Tesla stock has rallied 54% off its February low, though it's squatting 25% below its 52-week high. It's the same trend for Apple stock, albeit its rally has been less decisive.Besides Nvidia, highly rated IBD chip stocks that derive some of their business from Apple include Broadcom (AVGO), IBD Leaderboard stock Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Mellanox (MLNX).Nvidia and Broadcom are also key Tesla partners. Other chipmakers revving up their ""connected cars"" game include Mobileye (MBLY), Qorvo (QRVO), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS).Even better, chipmakers continue to be innovative and disruptive. New markets are fueling growth. Nvidia said in its February Q4 report that it’s at the ""center of four exciting growth opportunities — PC gaming, VR (virtual reality), deep learning and self-driving cars.""""It’s a great time to operate in the semiconductor industry,"" Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said last week at an analysts' confab. “You have a substantial profit pool . . . compared to similar industries of the same size.”If you're up for a high-risk, high-reward ETF investing bet, here are four options that bypass investing in diversified technology stocks for a targeted play on the chip industry:SOXX, like the broad stock market, posted four straight weeks of gains Friday. It sank roughly 20% following a failed breakout from a cup-with-handle base in January but has advanced the same amount from its February low of 74.80.The oldest semiconductor ETF, SOXX tracks a modified cap-weighted index of global semiconductor companies listed in the U.S. Its fifth largest holding is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and Dutch business NXP is sixth. It holds 30 stocks in total, capping portfolio weight at 8%.Dominant industry player Intel (INTC) has an 8% weighting.The ETF's 0.47% expense ratio is middle-of-the-road, while it has outperformed its peers over the past five years with an annual average 10.4% gain. Year to date through March 11, it's down 0.5%.SOXX is trading 12% off its 52-week high.SMH tracks a market-cap-weighted index of 25 of the largest U.S.-listed semiconductors companies. The average market cap of its holdings is $41.26 billion vs. $23.19 million for SOXX.Top holding Intel accounts for a 17% portfolio weighting and Taiwan Semi for 15%. The ETF is highly concentrated -- with 76% of assets in its top 10 holdings, more than any of its peers.The ETF rates well for cost metrics such as a 0.35% expense ratio, price to net asset value (NAV) and bid-ask spread.SMH does not have a five-year history but is the best-performing semiconductor ETF year to date. It's up 0.6%, unlike its peers, which have suffered mild losses.It is sitting 11% below its June high.This $202.4 million ETF is ideal for investors who wish to tilt toward smaller growth stocks and can stomach volatility. Still, it's a well-diversified fund. No single stock accounts for more than 4% of portfolio assets and it has a mere 32% of assets in the top 10 holdings -- lowest among its peers.Small-cap Monolithic Power (MPWR) accounts for a 3% portfolio weighting, as does Intel.Its holdings include stocks such as First Solar (FSLR) and SunPower (SPWR). Still, industry watcher ETF.com describes it as having the highest percentage of pure-play semiconductors in its segment.XSD shares a 0.35% expense ratio with SMH. It has produced a 9.7% annual average gain over the past five years and is down 0.3% so far in 2016.The ETF is trading 6% below its June high.PSI tracks a modified equal-weighted index designed to identify stocks within the semiconductor industry that have the potential for capital appreciation, using proprietary stock selection methods, according to S&P Global. It screens holdings based on risk factors, style classification and stock valuation.Those criteria come with a corresponding high cost -- its expense ratio is 0.63%. Portfolio turnover is at the top end too, at 50%.That might all be well if PSI delivered on beating the market. However, it trails with an 8.8% average annual gain over the past five years. Year to date, it's down 2.7%.Like XSD, it shows a small growth skew. The average market cap of its 30 holdings is $6.22 million.PSI is the only ETF in its segment to trade less than 50,000 shares a day on average. It's mired 15% below its June high.

264,SWKS,"FAA and NOAA demand for weather applications will drive approximately $500 million in additional annual revenue over the upcoming five years for IBD Leaderboard stock Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), a Needham analyst said Friday following the chipmaker's ""upbeat"" analyst day.Macom stock rose 5.8% on the stock market today, to 43.79 -- nearing its all-time high of 44.15, achieved Monday -- and extended 5.7% from a 41.42 buy point.IBD's 41-company Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group jumped 2.3% Friday, spurred by Macom. Shares of chip rivals Analog Devices (ADI), Qorvo (QRVO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) -- all Apple (AAPL) suppliers -- rose 1.2%, 2.2% and 3.5%, respectively.Needham analyst N.

Barclays boosted its price target on Macom stock to 44 from 41 and maintained an overweight rating.Optical, gallium nitride (GaN) and active antenna radar could each double Macom's approximately $500 million revenue over the next three to five years, ""potentially driving up to $2 billion of annual revenue by 2020,"" Bolton wrote in a research report.""While management was clear the team may not bat 1,000 and that timing of specific product ramps was difficult to accurately forecast, management has clearly set an objective to become a much larger company,"" he wrote.Macom’s $2.3 billion market cap puts it distantly behind industry leader Intel (INTC) and Intel’s $150 billion market cap. Unlike its Apple-supplying rivals, Macom’s chips aren't focused on consumer products but instead are used in commercial and industrial applications like cellphone base stations, military radar and lasers.Macom also is developing GaN-on-silicon chips, squaring off with privately held Transform, Infineon Technologies and Efficient Power Conversion (EPC). GaN transistors can turn on and off faster than silicon, can withstand a higher voltage and are markedly smaller.Last year, EPC figured out how to make them cheaper, too, EPC CEO Alex Lidow told IBD in February. Lidow used to head up International Rectifier, which Infineon acquired in 2014. Companies like EPC aim to use GaN in electronic components such as transistors.EPC grows a thin layer of gallium nitride on silicon wafers and, like Macom, it uses the chips in cellphone base stations.""GaN is being used in base stations, going up in Google balloons and Facebook (FB) drones,"" Lidow said. Other applications include a swallowable colonoscopy pill, autonomous cars (Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla Motors (TSLA) are among the competitors) and wireless charging.Lidow estimates a $370 billion total addressable market -- $30 billion in power, $40 billion in analog and $300 billion in digital.Macom is trying to grab some of it. The company has been in talks with smartphone makers Huawei, Nokia (NOK) and Ericsson (ERIC) for over a year and just recently completed customer validation, Bolton wrote.""If the commercial contract negotiations go well, management believes the company could generate first production revenue for GaN-on-Si (GaN-on-silicon power amplifiers) by year-end 2016,"" he wrote.Macom estimates that it can scoop 40%-60% of the base station power amplifier market over the next three to five years.RELATED: 5 Chip Stocks To Watch, Moving Up, With Apple's Big Event March 21

265,SWKS," With the rising Internet of Things, connected cars and cloud computing all fostering chipmaker growth, Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) make the IBD 50 list of top-ranked growth stocks. Broadcom is set to report quarterly earnings Thursday after the market close, and it could serve as a bellwether for several other chip stocks that have moved up to or past their 50-day lines in the past couple weeks as the stock market has improved.Broadcom and Nvidia are top-ranked, with IBD Composite Ratings of 98 and a best-possible 99, respectively.Broadcom, which merged with Avago Technologies in February and kept the latter's stock symbol ""AVGO,"" moved up for five straight days before pulling back 1% in the stock market today. After the market rout last month, Nvidia has risen 30% since Feb. 11, and Avago has added 18%, compared to the S&P 500 index's 9% gain. Broadcom is still down 6% for the year, and Nvidia is flat, while the S&P has declined 3%.Analysts are looking for earnings per share of $2.30 for Broadcom's fiscal 2016 first quarter, on revenue up 6% to $1.75 billion. Nvidia's latest quarter, reported in February, brought 12% revenue growth with gains across all market platforms that the company serves: gaming, professional visualization, data center and automotive.Both Broadcom and Nvidia serve a variety of industries, and they're both Apple (AAPL) suppliers. One growing field for both is connected cars, as automakers add more entertainment and information technology, and as vehicles move closer to self-driving.At the Geneva International Motor Show underway this week, Daimler (DDAIF) showed off a self-braking and self-parking Mercedes E-Class. Tesla Motors (TSLA) is also there, and its Autopilot technology recently made an MIT Technology Review list of the top 10 technology developments for 2016.Several other chipmakers playing in car tech, among other fields, have recovered to or above their key 50-day lines in the past couple weeks. Though not as highly rated by IBD as are Nvidia and Broadcom, they include Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) with an 81 Composite Rating, Ambarella (AMBA) with a 74, Qorvo (QRVO) with a 63, and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) with a 67.In all, Broadcom supplies analog and digital chips for uses such as data center networking, home connectivity, broadband access, telecom equipment, smartphones and base stations, data center servers and storage, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and displays.Apple's varying iPhone sales will be a factor for Broadcom.""Given an uncertain demand environment within storage and the recent iPhone inventory correction,"" Pacific Crest Securities analyst John Vinh wrote in a research note, ""we see limited revenue upside opportunities. However, we expect investors to look through to the ramp of the iPhone 7, where we anticipate over 20% content gains.""Sterne Agee analyst Doug Freedman said in a research note that Broadcom is his 2016 top-pick idea, ""as we believe the smartphone weakness is well reflected in estimates and will likely be more than offset by the consolidated business outlook going forward.""

276,SWKS,"Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 6S tornado hit shares of chipmakers NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Qorvo (QRVO), a Goldman Sachs analyst wrote Wednesday ahead of the duo's quarterly earnings reports.Both are expected to report 16% dips in December-quarter sales and earnings that fell by double digits during the holiday season.""Smartphone-exposed stocks have been under pressure recently after a slew of negative pre-announcements among suppliers with heavy Apple exposure,"" Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs wrote in a research report.But Hari sees the potential for a ""snap-back"" as ""investors digest Apple's weak Q1 and begin to look at what we believe will be a relatively strong 2016 overall.""NXP Semiconductors fell 2.9% on the stock market today ahead of its late Wednesday Q4 earnings report. Qorvo stock closed down 0.2% and is scheduled to report fiscal Q3 earnings late Thursday. Apple for its part, rose 2% on Wednesday.For its December quarter, NXP is expected to report $1.29 billion in sales and $1.07 earnings per share ex items, down 16% and 21%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter.The consensus view of 25 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters was relatively in line with NXP's three-months-ago guidance for a sales decline of ""low to mid-teens,"" sequentially.For the year, analysts model $5.78 billion in sales and $5.43 EPS minus items, up 2% and 14%, respectively, vs. 2014.Hari rates NXP stock a neutral as it continues realizing synergies from its recently completed acquisition of Freescale Semiconductor.The merger reduced NXP's Apple exposure by essentially half, Hari noted. He expects NXP to mount up on its automotive content, expected to grow by 9% CAGR over the next three years. Advanced driver assistance systems, infotainment and autonomous vehicles will drive that growth.Late Thursday, Qorvo is expected to report $620.3 million in sales and 94 cents EPS ex items for its fiscal Q3. On a year-over-year basis, sales would dip 16% and EPS would be down 37%.Qorvo, Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Dialog Semiconductor drove smartphone pressure with their negative pre-announcements late last year. Qorvo reduced its fiscal Q3 sales guide to $620 million from earlier views for $720 million to $730 million.The company didn't reduce its EPS ex items guide for $1.25 to $1.30.Hari downgraded Qorvo stock to neutral from a buy rating on its ""disadvantage to Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) ... given (Qorvo's) ongoing integration and Skyworks' ability to leverage its portfolio of adjacent analog products to provide more complete solutions to handset (smartphone-makers).""Qorvo was created in January 2015 with the merger of RFMD and TriQuint, and competes against radio-frequency (RF) chip suppliers Skyworks and Avago Technologies (AVGO).RF content in smartphones is expected to grow 9% and 14% in 2016 and 2017, Hari estimated. That's against an 0.4% decline in smartphone unit growth in 2016 vs. 1.4% growth in 2015, he wrote.Although Qorvo's portfolio is more complete post-merger, Hari questioned the timeline on synergies. The company guided to $150 million in synergies in 2017 with $75 million realized in 2015.

277,SWKS,"Apple (AAPL) supplier Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) has joined Cirrus Logic (CRUS) in betting big on the rumored iPhone 7, with expectations that the September iteration of the smartphone could drive double-digit sequential growth in Q3.First, Skyworks will have to brace for a March-quarter speed bump, MKM analyst Ian Ing wrote in a research report Friday in which he reiterated his buy rating but cut his price target on Skyworks stock to 100 from 112, following the company's earnings beat late Thursday.At least two other analysts cut their price targets on Skyworks stock after the chipmaker's fiscal-first-quarter earnings report, despite the beat. Yet in midday trading on the stock market today, Skyworks stock was up 2.7%, above 66. Earlier, shares rose by as much as 7.7%.Skyworks reported $926.8 million in sales, up 15% year over year, and $1.60 earnings per share ex items, up 27%, for its Q1 ended Jan. 1.Both measures topped the consensus of 26 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $919.95 billion and $1.58 and met Skyworks' earlier guidance for $925 million-$930 million and $1.60.But current-quarter guidance lagged Wall Street views on ""an unusually large customer inventory adjustment,"" B Riley analyst Craig Ellis wrote in a report. Late Tuesday, Apple reported 74.78 million iPhones shipped in its December quarter, up 0.4% but trailing Wall Street views for 75.2 million.Ellis reiterated a buy rating but lowered his price target on Skyworks stock to 102 from 110.For the March quarter, Skyworks sees $775 million in sales and $1.24 EPS minus items, which would be up 2% and 8%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. The consensus model was for $817.8 million and $1.32.""The quarter-over-quarter decline is two times (greater) than any other Q2 since 2010,"" Ellis wrote.But the guide is ""comparable among Apple suppliers"" on weaker-than-anticipated iPhone 6S shipments, Ing wrote.""March-quarter revenue guidance down 16% (sequentially) suggests that Skyworks is performing similarly to peers and is not immune to a challenging macro environment and sharp reductions in customer forecasts,"" Ing wrote. ""That said, Skyworks is confident that September 2016 growth returns to double digits.""Separately, both analysts see Skyworks' dollar content growing in the iPhone 7.Late Wednesday, fellow Apple supplier Cirrus Logic made a similar wager on Apple's iPhone 7, expecting the inclusion of noise-cancelling headphones could drive sales growth above its 15% forecast for 2017.Outside Apple's sphere, Skyworks' diverse analog portfolio could lead to market share gains in smartphone chipsets, wireless infrastructure and the Internet of Things markets, Canaccord Genuity analyst T. Michael Walkley wrote in a report. Walkley maintained his buy rating on Skyworks stock but dropped his price target to 105 from 110.And in China, Skyworks expects ample growth opportunities with emerging LTE trends, Ellis wrote.

279,SWKS,"Wall Street expects Apple (AAPL) to post modest revenue and earnings growth in the June quarter, despite worries about slowing iPhone sales ahead of the launch of the company's 11th-generation model.XAnalysts say Apple is likely to give conservative guidance for the September quarter, given uncertainties around the launch date and initial supply of the rumored iPhone 8 and other new handsets. Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple is scheduled to deliver its fiscal third-quarter results and give fiscal fourth-quarter guidance after the market close on Aug. 1.Wall Street is modeling for Apple to earn $1.57 a share, up 11% year over year, on sales of $44.92 billion, up 6%, in the June quarter. For the current quarter, analysts are looking for Apple to earn $1.85 a share, up 11%, on sales of $49.94 billion, up 7%.""For fiscal Q4, we expect the outlook to be in-line to slightly below estimates,"" Mizuho Securities analyst Abhey Lamba said in a note to clients Thursday.He rates Apple stock as neutral with a price target of 150.""We remain on the sidelines given our view that the large upcoming (iPhone) cycle is already baked into the stock,"" he said.Apple was down a fraction to close at 150.27 on the stock market today.

Apple has an IBD Composite Rating of 80, meaning it has outperformed 80% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more information, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Apple is expected to introduce an OLED-screen iPhone 8 in September along with upgraded versions of its current-generation LCD-display phones, which possibly will be called the iPhone 7S series.In addition to a larger, 5.8-inch display, the iPhone 8 is rumored to feature wireless charging, augmented reality capabilities, improved cameras and other upgraded components.Apple analysts are following the quarterly results of chip suppliers such as Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) for clues to Apple's iPhone production ramp up.Late Thursday, Woburn, Mass.-based Skyworks reported better-than-expected sales and earnings for its fiscal third quarter and guided analysts higher for the current quarter.Skyworks makes analog chips for wireless communications and power management. Apple accounts for about 40% of Skyworks sales.Skyworks management feels good about the company's business from the next-generation iPhone cycle, Needham analyst Quinn Bolton said in a report Friday.""When asked about potential delays at its largest customer, management responded that they see a predictable sales cycle with good backlog visibility and feel good about the company's content,"" Bolton said.Analysts will be looking for more data points from Apple's supply chain when Texas Instruments (TXN) reports second-quarter earnings on Tuesday and Cypress Semiconductor (CY) follows with its Q2 results on Thursday.TI gets a ""high single-digit"" percentage of its revenue from Apple business, Morgan Stanley said in a report Friday.Cypress is rumored to be providing a fast-charging socket for the new iPhone. The business potentially could generate $265 million in annual sales and add earnings of 14 cents a share or 13% upside, Morgan Stanley said.RELATED:These Five Tech Firms Are Corporate America's Biggest Cash Hoarders

But shares closed up 0.9% to 105.72, just below that buy point.Stocks tend to move with their groups. Still, it was striking how many cybersecurity plays acted like Check Point. Fortinet, FireEye (FEYE), Imperva (IMPV) and Palo Alto Networks all cleared entries intraday, only to close just under those levels. Proofpoint closed near session highs, moving into position for a possible breakout. All six are within 2% of valid entry points.Fortinet and Proofpoint will report quarterly results next week.Skyworks Solutions reports fiscal third-quarter earnings late Thursday. Skyworks is one of the earlier chipmakers to report, and one of the very first Apple iPhone chipmakers to do so. (Qualcomm (QCOM) reported late Wednesday, but its ongoing royalties feud with Apple doesn't make it a great bellwether for the iPhone ecosystem.)Skyworks is expected to report earnings per share of $1.51 vs. $1.24 a year earlier. That would be a 22% EPS gain. Revenue should be $890 million, with the 18% yearly gain matching fiscal Q2's.Skyworks rose 1.5% to 105.41 on Wednesday, closing in on a 112.21 entry from a cup base. Skyworks retook its 50-day moving average last Friday.Apple shares finally regained their 50-day line on Tuesday, but they've risen for nine straight sessions now. Apple is nearing a 156.75 flat-base entry.Apple supplier Broadcom is much closer than Skyworks or Apple. Broadcom rose 1.4% to 254.40 on Wednesday, now within 1% of a 256.88 entry from a base-on-base pattern.Apple will release quarterly results on Aug. 1.In addition to Check Point and Skyworks, a slew of big earnings reports are due Thursday.

Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Netflix's earnings Monday evening should show a 78% gain to 16 cents a share excluding various items, according to analysts tracked by Zacks Investment Research. Revenue likely climbed 31% to $2.76 billion. But subscriber growth may still be more important than earnings for investors. Netflix projected it would added a net 3.2 million subscribers in Q2, with 2.6 million coming from overseas.Microsoft crossed a 72.99 flat buy point on Friday but closed at 72.78, up 1.4%. Microsoft has risen for six straight sessions.

Skyworks is in a short cup base with a potential buy point of 112.21.Analysts expect a 23.5% EPS gain to $1.42 with revenue climbing 18% to $890 million.Skyworks is the first Apple iPhone chip supplier to report in the current season, so Thursday night's results and guidance will offer clues for Apple's upcoming quarterly report and those of other iPhone chipmakers.(Apple reports on Aug. 1. Apple's stock is in a flat base pattern with a 156.75 buy point. Apple has risen for several sessions but closed just below its 50-day line at 149.04.)Bank of America is in a cup-with-handle base with a potential buy point of 25.21. BofA fell 1.7% to 24.21 on Friday as investors reacted to earnings from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC). But BofA closed near the upper end half of its daily range. BofA shares rose 0.3%to 24.29 in premarket action.Bank of America reports on Tuesday. Wall Street expects EPS to jump 19% to 43 cents, with revenue up 7% to $21.915 billion.Morgan Stanley is in a consolidation with 46.08 buy point from a handle.

286,SWKS,"Nasdaq 100 futures jumped Wednesday after Apple (AAPL) reported better-than-expected earnings late Tuesday.XApple jumped in premarket trading on the stock market today, indicating an open at record highs and in a buy zone.Meanwhile, fellow Dow industrials stocks Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), Microsoft (MSFT) and Nike (NKE) all closed Tuesday just above or below proper buy points. Wal-Mart and Microsoft are Amazon.com (AMZN) rivals, while Nike recently agreed to partner with the e-commerce giant. Wal-Mart and Nike stocks in large part owe their recent chart patterns to Amazon-related news.S&P 500 index futures rose a fraction vs. fair value. Dow futures advanced 0.2%. Nasdaq 100 futures surged 0.7% above fair value.Apple was a big contributor to the futures' gain, especially the Nasdaq, rising 5.4% to 158.15 in premarket trading. The megacap tech has a 156.75 flat-base entry.Apple also pushed iPhone chipmakers such as Broadcom (AVGO) and Skyworks (SWKS) higher in late trading.Apple earnings rose 18% to $1.67 a share in its fiscal third quarter, a dime above estimates. Revenue grew 7% to $45.4 billion. Apple sold 41 million iPhones, also above forecasts.Investors should be cautious about electronic trading. Apple could open, or close, Wednesday's regular session far differently. Apple also 57is off its very best overnight levels.RELATED:Apple Jumps On Strong Earnings, Revenue, GuidanceWal-Mart shares rose 0.6% to 80.50 Tuesday, clearing a 80.57 cup-without-handle buy point after rising intraday to 80.73, their best level in more than two years. Volume was below average, which suggests a lack of institutional buying. Breakouts from cup-without-handle bases tend to be less successful than from cup-with-handle patterns because they don't offer a good shakeout of weak holders. Wal-Mart's nine-session winning streak adds to that issue.Wal-Mart stock gapped down below its 50-day moving average on July 16 when Amazon announced that it would buy Whole Foods Market (WFM). The news hit many grocery sellers, and Wal-Mart is the biggest grocery-seller in the U.S.But unlike many other stocks such as Costco (COST) or Kroger (KR), Wal-Mart has found support and obviously has bounced back. Wal-Mart has been making aggressive moves in e-commerce initiatives and takeovers. It has the online heft, growth and innovation to at least make Amazon work hard.Wal-Mart will report second-quarter earnings later this month.RELATED:Amazon 'Well-Positioned' To Capture Market Share In Grocery DeliveryMicrosoft shares edged down 0.2% to 72.58, their fifth consecutive decline and the second straight session below a 72.99 flat-base buy point. Microsoft cleared that entry on July 17 and edged higher from there before the recent mild slide.Microsoft reported blowout fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on July 20, with cloud computing a key reason. Microsoft is becoming a significant rival to the much-larger Amazon Web Services. Apple soared late Tuesday on earnings and guidance, signaling a likely move above a buy point.RELATED:Amazon Cloud Services Under Growing Threat From Microsoft, Google, IBMNike shares rose 1.3% to 59.84, once again moving above a 59.10 buy point. Nike initially crossed that entry intraday on July 30, skyrocketing 11% to close at 59 that day. That followed Nike's strong earnings with the athletic apparel giant also confirming that it would begin selling products directly via Amazon.Amazon, which is not a Dow component, rose 0.85% to 996.19 on Tuesday. That snapped a three-day sell-off but closed just short of its 50-day moving average. Amazon also has fallen back below a 1,016.60 entry point.RELATED:The Big Picture: Stop Worrying And Learn To Love The DowDow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And AnalysisRetail And E-Commerce News And Stocks To WatchYes There's Tesla, But These 3 Stocks Are Near Entries: Investing Action Plan

287,SWKS,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average edged higher early Wednesday ahead of a new wave of big earnings and the Federal Reserve's latest policy announcement.Strong results late Tuesday from Texas Instruments (TXN) and AT&T (T), are good news for Apple (AAPL) and the iPhone ecosystem ahead of Apple's own earnings. Meanwhile, Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL) are among four IBD 50 stocks with earnings due Wednesday, with Facebook providing further evidence that is beating back Snapchat operator Snap (SNAP).XThe Dow industrials rose 0.5% in Tuesday's regular session, led by earnings from Caterpillar (CAT) and McDonald's (MCD) as well as strength in financials. The Nasdaq composite, weighed down by Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), closed just above break-even, but did hit a new all-time high. The S&P 500 index rose 0.3% to a fresh record.Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, hit yet another record intraday low on Tuesday. VIX lows are a sign of investor complacency and often associated with at least short-term market tops.Still, S&P 500 and Dow futures rose 0.1% vs. fair value and Nasdaq 100 futures 0.2% as equities generally advanced across the globe. Crude oil prices continued to climb after big gains Tuesday.The Fed is not expected to make any policy changes Wednesday afternoon, though policymakers could surprise and announce a plan to let the central bank's $4.5 trillion balance sheet start to decline. Most analysts see that shift happening at the September meeting.President Trump told the Wall Street Journal that Apple will build three plants in the U.S. Trump has made similar statements before. Apple had no comment Tuesday. U.S. operations would ease political pressures, but would likely be more expensive. It's possible that Foxconn, a key assembler of iPhones, could set up some plant in America.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter. That options strategy is highlighted in IBD's weekly Earnings Preview column.Meanwhile, Texas Instruments reported better-than-expected earnings late Tuesday and gave bullish guidance. Texas Instruments is big in automotive chips and many other segments, as well as in mobile devices like the Apple iPhone. But TI follows a beat-and-raise last week from Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), another Apple iPhone chipmaker and an IBD 50 member.AT&T reported better-than-expected wireless subscriber figures, while churn hit a record low. That's a good sign for Apple iPhone sales during what could be a spring lull ahead of the iPhone 8 later this year. Relatively strong iPhone 7 demand is key, given the likelihood that the next-generation iPhone will be delayed.Apple shares edged higher in premarket trading. Apple closed up 0.4% to 152.73 in Tuesday's stock market trading. Apple is approaching a 156.75 flat-base buy point.Facebook, PayPal, Lam Research (LRCX) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW) are IBD 50 stocks reporting earnings on Wednesday. Also, Facebook, PayPal and Lam Research all boast a best-possible 99 Composite Rating, which means they outperform 99% of all other stocks based on proprietary fundamental and technical ratings. Big stock winners often have Composite Ratings of at least 95 near the start of their big price runs.Facebook will be the third FANG (Facebook, Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet) stock to report Q2 results, following Alphabet late Monday and Netflix last week. Amazon is set to close out FANG earnings on Thursday.Facebook will presumably provide some new figures about the growing popularity of Instagram Stories and other offerings that clone Snapchat features. But here's a stat that's already out. Since Snap's March 1 IPO, Facebook's market capitalization has increased by about $81 billion to $479 billion. Snap's market value has retreated to just $16.4 billion. So Facebook has added the equivalent of nearly five Snapchats in Snap's brief history as a public firm.Facebook dipped 0.4% to 165.28 in Tuesday stock market trading after hitting a fresh record high on Monday. Facebook is extended from any possible entry. Snap fell 1.35% to 13.89, hitting a new record low.PayPal dipped 0.55% to 58.26, just beyond the 5% chase zone from a 55.24 flat-base buy point cleared earlier this month. The mobile payments firm expanded its reach via deals this month with Apple and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Chip-equipment maker Lam Research is in cup base just below a possible buy point. Edwards Lifesciences has fallen back below a buy point in a big cup-with-handle base, undercutting its 50-day line on Tuesday.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), D.R. Horton (DHI), ServiceNow (NOW) and Fortinet (FTNT) are among the many other top-rated stocks set to report earnings Wednesday.RELATED:Texas Instruments, AMD Beat Q2 Targets, Guide HigherAT&T Q2 Adjusted Profit Beats, Pay-TV Video Subscribers FallWill Facebook Earnings Support Its Strong Stock Growth?The Big Picture: Nasdaq Lags On Alphabet Loss, But Industrials, Financials LeadHow To Win With Growth Stocks Like Netflix, Nvidia During Earnings

288,SWKS,"Futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial averages were heading lower early Thursday morning. On Wednesday, chip stocks fueled the Nasdaq composite's 0.7% rally, on strong industry growth figures. But shares of Apple (AAPL) iPhone chip suppliers such as Broadcom (AVGO), Texas Instruments (TXN), Analog Devices (ADI), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) are all still below key support levels after significant sell-offs.XNasdaq 100 futures fell 0.6% vs. fair value, while S&P 500 futures sank 0.4%. Dow futures were off 0.25%.In Asian trading, Japan's Nikkei fell 0.4% and China's Shanghai composite rose 0.2%. In Europe intraday, the U.K.'s FTSE fell 0.7%, Germany's Dax 0.8% and France's CAC-40 1%.Apple shares themselves aren't acting that badly. The iPhone maker tumbled with other leading techs on June 9, then fell through its 50-day moving average on June 10. But since then the stock has moved sideways. Technically, Apple is in a flat base with a potential 156.75 buy point, though it needs to get above its 50-day line before investors should pay close attention.Apple's influence on the market is hard to overstate. Not only is the world's most valuable company by market cap and a member of the three major indexes, but its business strongly influences a raft of other companies, notably iPhone chip suppliers. Those chip stocks have been showing technical weakness, which one up session can't repair. Let's take a look at Broadcom, Texas Instruments, Analog Devices, Skyworks Solutions and Qorvo.Broadcom is one of the better-looking iPhone chip stocks. Shares began pulling back with other techs on June 9, but held above its 50-day moving average until finally losing that support last week. On Monday, shares fell intraday to 229.08, almost roundtripping a near-13% gain from a 227.85 buy point cleared in early May.Texas Instruments tumbled hard on June 9, losing a buy point. That started a test of the 50-day over several sessions, with shares closing below that level for good on June 20. Since then shares have continued to trend lower. On Wednesday, TI rose 0.85% after finding some support at the 200-day line.Analog Devices' woes started a little earlier that most techs. Analog Devices broke out on May 30, closing just above the 84.34 buy point. The next morning Analog Devices skyrocketed intraday to 90.49, but closed up only 1.1% at 85.76. On June 1, shares tumbled below the entry area, followed by undercutting the 50-day line two sessions later. Analog traded above and below the 50-day for several weeks before starting a new leg down on June 27. Shares rose 2.1% on Wednesday, trading between the 50-day and 200-day lines.Skyworks was well extended from any buy zone on June 9, nearly hitting an all-time high, when shares quickly reversed. Skyworks closed below its 50-day line for good on June 23, then kept heading lower. Skyworks rose 2.3% on Wednesday, but is still more than 5% below its 50-day.Qorvo is trying to find support at its 200-day line after a sharp June sell-off that took the chip stock below its 50-day line and a buy point. Shares rose 3.1% on Wednesday.RELATED:The Big Picture: Why The Sloppy Second-Half Start For StocksChip Stocks Jump As Industry Sees Strongest Growth In 7 YearsApple iPhone Demand Soft, But That's OK, Analyst ContendsQ2 Earnings Preview: Stocks Expecting 50%-Plus Growth

Skyworks stock ticked up 0.3% to 97.79.Aliso Viejo, Calif.-based Microsemi makes semiconductor systems for aerospace and defense, communications, data center and industrial markets.Woburn, Mass.-based Skyworks makes analog chips for wireless networking. Applications for its processors include automotive, broadband, cellular infrastructure, connected home, industrial, medical, military, smartphone, tablet and wearable markets.Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney sees multiple catalysts for Microsemi stock. Microsemi should benefit from increased spending and content gains in aerospace and defense, and growth in optical communications, data centers and other markets, he said in a note to clients.Plus, Delaney sees Microsemi as a potential acquisition target.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks includes six chip industry players include Nvidia and Microchip Technology.Elsewhere in the chip sector Thursday, investment bank Needham reiterated its strong buy rating on seven chip stocks.They include Adesto Technologies (IOTS), Everspin Technologies (MRAM), Inphi (IPHI), Microchip Technology (MCHP), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Quantenna Communications (QTNA) and Tower Semiconductor (TSEM).Needham analyst Quinn Bolton said Quantenna is his top pick for 2017.

290,SWKS,"Apple (AAPL) iPhone chip suppliers Broadcom (AVGO) and Texas Instruments (TXN), along with equipment giants Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX) — all five of these chip stocks are near buy zones, with Texas Instruments and Lam Research reporting this coming week.XInvestors also are digesting strong earnings this week from chipmaker Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), another Apple iPhone supplier, and Dutch chip-equipment maker ASML.Skyworks fell slightly Friday following its strong earnings report late Thursday. Skyworks' results and outlook offer some insight into demand for Apple and the overall Apple ecosystem. ASML, which reported on Wednesday, surged nearly 10% for the week, becoming extended from its July 14 breakout.As for Apple itself, the iPhone maker's stock dipped 7 cents to 150.27 on Friday, after an intraday test at its 50-day moving average. Apple ended a nine-day winning streak on Thursday as it moves toward a 156.75 flat-base buy point.Broadcom, which was down 0.1% to 253.11 in Friday stock market trading, is just below a 256.88 buy point of a base-on-base formation.Broadcom weathered the recent tech sell-off better than most leading chip stocks, spending only a few days below its 50-day line. However, the base is the chipmaker's fourth in the past year. As bases enter into later stages, breakouts are more likely to fail.Morgan Stanley analyst Craig Hettenbach said in a research note this month that Broadcom ""is picking up new (iPhone) content in custom applications, including touch and wireless charging.""However, Broadcom's planned purchase of Brocade Communications Systems (BRCD) has been put off to allow more time for government review.Texas Instruments, another Apple chipmaker, fell 1.2% to 81.70 on Friday, moving further away from a 84.75 buy point of a late-stage flat base.Texas Instruments reports second-quarter earnings on Tuesday. Earnings per share are expected to jump 25% to 95 cents, with revenue up 9% to $3.554 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.TI's margins have grown as more chips find their way into automobile technology, and as demand remains solid in the industrial space, Zacks said in a research note. While the company also stands to benefit from the expansion of more connected devices in general, it faces heightened competition from other chipmakers.Applied Materials, which provides equipment used to make chips, was close to a 47.96 buy point of a flat base. Shares dipped 0.9% to 46.81 on Friday.Lam Research is working on the right side of a short cup base with 167.15 buy point. Shares were off 0.8% to 163.53 Friday amid solid weekly gains.

291,SWKS,"Futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average were little changed early Friday morning following a flurry of big earnings releases, including Dow stocks Microsoft (MSFT) and Visa (V). Meanwhile, three top-rated techs — Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple-chip supplier Broadcom (AVGO) and Salesforce.com (CRM) — have moved within 2% of proper buy points.XNasdaq 100 futures fell fractionally vs. fair value, suggesting a threat to the Nasdaq composite's 10-day winning streak. Microsoft's blowout earnings didn't help after the software and cloud giant gave cautious revenue guidance. S&P 500 index and Dow futures were little changed.Alphabet fell 0.1% to 992.19 in Thursday's stock market trading. It's close to a 1,008.71 buy point in a flat base. Aggressive investors could treat 994.09 as an alternative entry, which Alphabet edged past during the last two sessions but has not closed above.Alphabet, which reports earnings next week, relies on search advertising revenue for the majority of its revenue. But cloud computing is a notable growth area, even though Google doesn't break that revenue out from ""other"" activities. Analysts say Google and especially Microsoft are gaining market share faster than industry leader Amazon.com (AMZN) via its Amazon Web Services division. Microsoft credited its June quarter's outperformance largely on cloud computing.Microsoft, for its part, closed Thursday at 74.22, above a recent 72.99 buy point. Shares rose modestly in premarket trading Friday.As for the other FANG internet stocks, Amazon, Facebook (FB) and Netflix (NFLX) have all hit record highs this week.Broadcom held up better than most other Apple chipmakers, only dropping below its 50-day moving average in late June and quickly regaining that support level in July. Broadcom fell 0.4% to 253.43 on Thursday, but is still just over 1% below a 256.88 buy point.Broadcom fell by a sliver in late trading following earnings of fellow Apple-chipmaker Skyworks Solutions (SWKS). Skyworks reported accelerating earnings and revenue growth, topping forecasts and giving strong guidance for the current quarter. But Skyworks fell about 3% late.The on-demand cloud-computing software pioneer rose 1.1% to 90.54, closing in on a 92.09 buy point from a flat base. An aggressive investor could treat 90.87 as an alternative entry.Salesforce's relative strength line, which tracks its performance vs. the S&P 500, is not as impressive as that of Alphabet and Broadcom.

292,SWKS,"The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index hit new highs as techs continued to reassert market leadership. Netflix (NFLX), Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Microsoft (MSFT) all hit record highs. Netflix soared on subscriber gains while Amazon will sell Kenmore appliances from Sears (SHLD), sending the latter sharply higher but hitting several retailers, including the Dow's Home Depot (HD). The Dow Jones industrial average also was hit by General Electric and banks, though blue-chip Visa (V) and American Express (AXP) continued the good news for payment stocks.XThe Nasdaq composite rose 1.2%, hitting record highs during the week, rising 10 straight sessions through Thursday. Netflix and other FANG stocks, such as Facebook and Amazon, contributed. The S&P 500 index climbed 0.5%, also hitting fresh highs during the week. Dow industrials fell 0.3%, weighed down by Goldman Sachs (GS), General Electric (GE) and Home Depot.Internet television network Netflix added 5.2 million net new subscribers in the June quarter vs. Wall Street's consensus estimate of 3.22 million. It also guided higher for the current quarter, with a forecast of 4.4 million net new subscribers, topping the consensus view for 3.97 million. Bulls pointed to its strong subscriber growth, while bears voiced caution about its ballooning video-content obligations, including original TV series like ""Stranger Things"" and ""Glow."" Netflix ended Q2 with 103.95 million subscribers worldwide, including 51.92 million in the U.S. and 52.03 million in foreign markets. Netflix's international streaming subscribers topped those in the U.S. for the first time in Q2.Netflix skyrocketed 17% to record highs for the week.Sears will sell Alexa-enabled Kenmore appliances via Amazon, sending its shares soaring on Thursday but the gave up most of that gains on Friday. But Whirlpool (WHR) and major sellers of appliances Home Depot, Lowe's (LOW) and Best Buy (BBY) were hit. Home improvement chains Home Depot and Lowe's had been seen as Amazon-proof, or at least Amazon-resistant. Best Buy, which has bounced back in recent years from Amazon's initial onslaught, was hurt earlier this month on news that Amazon is creating a Geek Squad rival.Amazon appears to be getting more government attention as its size and scope grow, with an FTC probe and antitrust rumblings.Software giant Microsoft earned 98 cents excluding items for the June fiscal fourth quarter, up 42% year over year and well above views for 71 cents. Revenue rose 9% to $24.7 billion after forecasts for $24.27 billion. Microsoft credited demand for cloud-computing services like Azure and Office 365 as well as its acquisition of LinkedIn. But the Dow component gave cautious guidance for the current quarter. Shares dipped Friday but remain in buy range.RELATED:Microsoft Crushes Earnings Estimates; Stock Dips On OutlookGeneral Electric fell 2.9% on Friday after saying full-year EPS is trending to the low end of its $1.60-$1.70 target, citing oil and gas weakness. GE reported smaller earnings and revenue declines for Q2, though some analysts cited some weakness below the headline figures. Fellow industrial conglomerate Honeywell International (HON) also beat on top and bottom lines, but guided full-year estimates slightly higher. Honeywell shares rose Friday, retaking a buy point.RELATED:General Electric Stock Dives On Earnings OutlookAmerican Express beat on the top and bottom lines, though provisions for losses jumped 26% due to loan-portfolio growth and a rise in the rate for lending write-offs. Visa earnings also topped, with strong cross-border travel – helped by the stronger dollar – and global payment volumes driving results, according to Mizuho analyst Thomas McCrohan. The company also hiked its full-year revenue growth outlook above views. Visa and American Express, both Dow components, rose 2.8% and 0.4%, respectively, with both still in buy range.TD Ameritrade (AMTD) stock broke out from a long consolidation on July 18 as the online broker beat on both the top and bottom lines, even as industry trading fees for stocks and ETFs have plunged this year. Charles Schwab (SCHW) that day matched views, with shares falling below a 42.71 buy point that they had cleared in late June. E-Trade (ETFC) shares gapped up to make a new 52-week high on Friday after the company scored an overall beat Thursday. Shares are now out of buy range.Chip-gear maker ASML (ASML) and wireless-communications chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) were the first major semiconductor industry players to report June-quarter earnings this year. ASML rose to record highs after posting better-than-expected sales and earnings during the second quarter. Qualcomm disappointed with its current-quarter profit outlook that came up short of views, even though it beat estimates for its fiscal Q3. Apple (AAPL) chip-supplier Skyworks (SWKS) reported better-than-expected fiscal Q3 sales and earnings and guided higher for the current period.Drug giants Novartis (NVS) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) reported better-than-expected earnings Tuesday. Dow component J&J reported adjusted income of $1.83 a share, topping views by 4 cents. But sales of $18.84 billion were light. Novartis' $1.22 a share, excluding various items on $12.24 billion in sales, topped analyst views.Both drug stocks rose during the week, but were both still in buy range as of Friday's close.Goldman Sachs' fixed-income trade revenue plunged 40% in Q2, the second straight quarter that the trading-heavy bank said it misread the market. Weaker trading and net-interest income also hurt Bank of America (BAC), though Fed rate hikes have helped the bank and it said it expected net-interest income to rise in Q3. Morgan Stanley (MS) reported that trading revenue fell, but less so than rivals. JPMorgan (JPM) and Citigroup (C) have also signaled caution amid slow loan growth and longer-term bond yields, which can indicate flagging confidence over the chances for long-term economic gains. Morgan Stanley cleared a buy point while Goldman undercut its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.Check Point Software (CHKP) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings on Thursday, but gave weak guidance for the current Q3. Check Point tumbled 7.2% that day, falling below its 50-day moving average. Check Point on Wednesday briefly topped a buy point but closed below that trigger. So did four other cybersecurity stocks that day. Those stocks, along with Proofpoint (PFPT), retreated modestly on Check Point's warning.United Airlines (UAL) on Tuesday offered a disappointing third-quarter unit-revenue forecast as airline competition picks up heading further into the summer, sending its shares plunging 10.4%. Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Airlines (AAL), which have remained bullish on the key metric, fell significantly as well.

293,SWKS,"After a ho-hum 2016, $12.1 billion MainStay Large Cap Growth Fund (MLAAX) is having a hi-ho 2017. The fund's 2.62% setback last year badly lagged the S&P 500's 11.96% gain. It trailed 90% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. But its 21.24% gain this year going into Thursday more than doubled the big-cap bogey's 10.32% return and trumped 89% of its direct rivals.XThe fund's rally reflects the market's shift away from defensive, low-growth staples-providers and higher-dividend stocks, which dominated for much of last year, to the sort of higher growth stocks that the fund favors. Fund co-manager Patrick Burton — on this job since early 2013 — says leading technology stocks in particular have been buoyed by market-share gains and strong earnings. Burton and lead manager Justin Kelly are with subadvisor Winslow Capital.Reflecting that market tilt, the fund has been boosted this year by such holdings as Alibaba Group (BABA), which is up 66%. The fund also holds graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), which is up 46% this year. Digital-media and marketing-software firm Adobe Systems (ADBE) is up 39%. Biomed Celgene (CELG), which is up 14%, is a fast grower in health care.""Alibaba is the No. 1 player in e-commerce in China,"" Burton said. It is benefiting from the shift to mobile devices. Gross sales are still growing rapidly despite its size. And Alibaba Cloud, like Amazon Web Services, is growing very fast, he says.Nvidia is benefiting from a shift toward the use of graphics processing units (GPU), away from regular CPU computer chips, because of their faster processing speeds in applications such as artificial intelligence and self-driving cars, Burton says.Adobe is shifting from selling software licenses to annual subscriptions. ""Customers churn less and buy more"" under that model, Burton says.Celgene stock is up due to a combination of decent earnings and attractive valuation ""since biotech has been under pressure for a couple of years,"" Burton said.Over the past 10 years, the fund's 8.18% average annual gain topped 72% of its rivals. Winslow's Kelly has been at the helm since late 2005.The fund aims to navigate through various market phases by adjusting its allocations among three types of growth stocks.One bucket holds stocks that the managers see as long-term, sustainable earnings growers. The second bucket holds quality cyclical growers, which may be more volatile. And the third holds stocks in newer industries with rapid growth.Visa (V) is a sustainable grower. Its takeover of Visa Europe boosts economies of scale and leads to better coordination of global marketing campaigns, Burton says, adding, ""It's a really steady Eddie, consistent grower.""Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) is one of the fund's cyclicals. They supply radio frequency filters for Apple (AAPL), Samsung and Chinese cellphones. ""What's changing is that they are moving into other products that need wireless applications like Tesla (TSLA) (cars),"" Burton said. ""They are pushing to get involved in the internet of things.""ServiceNow (NOW) is a new-industry stock, which is expanding from IT management for clients into new areas like cybersecurity and human resources.Celgene, whose cancer drug Revlimid is its flagship, is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group. The group is ranked No. 8 among 197.Wall Street expects earnings per share to climb 23% this year. Pretax margin last year of 50.4% was its highest in at least nine years.IBD'S TAKE: You can check out more of Celgene's fundamental and technical strengths in IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.Illumina (ILMN) and Netflix (NFLX) were new additions to the fund's portfolio in the second quarter.Illumina is a leader in low-cost gene-sequencing equipment. Burton said, ""We believe Illumina will demonstrate an accelerating growth profile over the course of this year and next, driven by the launch of its new gene-sequencing instrument, Novaseq. We believe this acceleration will drive upside to (analysts') consensus (earnings) estimates.""Netflix returned to the portfolio after being sold. Its EPS rose 50%, 71%, 114% and 567% in the past four quarters.Netflix is facing increasing competition from Hulu and stocks like Amazon.com (AMZN) and YouTube-owner Google (GOOGL) — both also owned by MainStay Large Cap Growth. Netflix's drivers are its original programming and global expansion, Burton says.RELATED:MainStay Large Cap Growth Sees Market Tilting Toward Its Favorite Types Of Growth Stocks

294,SWKS,"Technology stocks still led the U.S. stock market with less than an hour to go on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve's minutes from its latest interest-rate policy meeting in June did not appear to show any significant surprises in the central bank's thinking on the economy.The minutes noted that while the U.S. economy continues to show strength in the labor markets and business spending, inflation remains a concern as the Fed continues to gradually raise the cost of money back to normal levels. ""Recent readings on headline and core PCE price inflation had come in lower than participants had expected,"" the minutes noted. ""On a 12-month basis, headline PCE price inflation was running somewhat below the committee's 2% objective in April, partly because of factors that appeared to be transitory.""The Nasdaq composite, powered by a broad rally in the semiconductor sector, rose nearly 0.6% at 3:20 p.m. ET. At the session's high of 6163, the tech-centered index was slightly above its 50-day moving average. It challenged buying support at that intermediate-term support line on June 29. The Nasdaq 100 gained more than 1.1%.A sharp drop in crude oil futures hit the pause button for a rebound in energy stocks, weighing partly on the other broad equity indexes. U.S. oil futures sank more than 4% to $45.07 a barrel.The S&P 500 rose 0.1% while the Dow Jones industrial average was flat.Among IBD's 197 industry groups ranked daily for relative performance, the chipmaking, chip design and chipmaking equipment groups occupied three of the top four spots, with gains of 1.5% or more. Gaming software, design software, desktop software and internet retailing stocks also led the market, with each group rising more than 1%.Volume on both main exchanges is almost guaranteed to be higher vs. Monday, which was a half-day session that ended at 1 p.m. ET; the markets were closed on Tuesday for the Fourth of July holiday.While Intel (INTC) remains sluggish, as seen by its poor relative performance since a Jan. 24 breakout past a 37.44 cup-with-handle entry failed, shares enjoyed a solid 2% gain to 34.22 in about average turnover. Watch to see if the former big-cap tech leader, which has already issued a few sell signals this year, has the muscle to rebound back above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which are near 35.65 and 35.97, respectively.The king of microprocessors for computers and other electronic devices has a mediocre IBD Composite Rating of 54, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. However, it's expected to grow quarterly earnings in the June quarter by 15%, which would mark the third quarter of double-digit EPS gains in four quarters.In Intel's semiconductor manufacturing industry group, eight names have an IBD Composite Rating of 90 or higher and trade at 10 a share or higher.  Power Integrations (POWI) and IXYS (IXYS) are both holding nicely above their respective 50-day moving averages, while Macom Tech (MTSI), No. 40 in the IBD 50, is currently testing support.However, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Analog Devices (ADI), Tower Semiconductor (TSEM), Microchip Tech (MCHP) and Skyworks (SWKS) are currently treading below their 50-day lines.Continued price action below the 50-day would imply that institutional investors are taking a break from heavy buying and are more inclined to take some profits. Mild corrections could lead to future bases forming.Skyworks, up more than 2% to 97.68, is still nearly 13% below a 52-week peak of 121.11. That is enough of a decline for the Apple iPhone chip supplier to create a shallow new cup or flat-base pattern. Fundamentals are improving at the Woburn, Mass., firm, which stopped a two-quarter slump in profits by growing earnings per share 1% and 16% in the prior two quarters.The Street sees earnings rebounding even faster in the June-ended fiscal third quarter, rising 23% to $1.52 a share, which would mark the strongest gain in six quarters. Analysts see revenue increasing 18% to $890.5 million, then up an additional 17% to $973.7 million in the September-ending fiscal fourth quarter.Skyworks gets a 91 Composite Rating, far superior to the 54 score of Intel.Among the nine chipmakers mentioned above, Microchip earns the highest Composite Rating of 98. Earnings are seen jumping 24% to $4.96 a share in fiscal 2018, ending in March next year.RELATED:Is It Time To Sell Intel?Inside IBD 50: Why It's Important To Think ""Small Supply""Where Are Stocks Headed?

298,SWKS,"Apple (AAPL) supplier stocks took a thumping Monday, ahead of expected lackluster reports from a number of the companies, as well as Apple, on slowing growth for iPhone sales.Qualcomm (QCOM) stock was down just a fraction, but shares of Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and InvenSense (INVN) were down 2.5% and 4.5%, respectively, in early afternoon trading on the stock market today. All three are slated to post December-quarter results after the close Wednesday.Shares of Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), meanwhile, were each down more than 1.5% Monday afternoon. Skyworks is slated to report earnings late Thursday, and NXP on Feb. 4.Apple was down a fraction Monday afternoon. It reports after the close Tuesday, with Wall Street eyeing Apple's China sales. China accounted for a quarter of iPhone sales in 2015, according to one report. That nation's slowing economic growth has put a damper on stock markets worldwide, and on many tech stocks specifically.The December quarter is Apple's first full quarter of iPhone 6S series sales. Suppliers Cirrus Logic, Qorvo and Dialog Semiconductor recently slashed their December views on apparently slowing iPhone demand.For its fiscal Q3, Cirrus Logic said earlier this month it expects $347 million in sales, down from its earlier guidance for $370 million to $400 million.The consensus of eight analysts polled by Thomson Reuters projects a 16% year-over-year dip in EPS ex items to 81 cents.

300,SWKS,"A ton of quarterly earnings will be issued next week, with a lot of the spotlight on Apple (AAPL). Let's focus in on five chipmakers, including some Apple suppliers, that are on tap to report: Macom Technology (MTSI), Cavium (CAVM), Cirrus Logic (CRUS), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Microsemi (MSCC) .Macom Technology has an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of 99 and reports on Tuesday. Analysts expect earnings to rise 3% with revenue down 1%.Shares have been able to find support at the 200-day line in recent weeks, and retook the 50-day line in Wednesday's session, then advanced 4.4% on Thursday. Macom is now back in buy range from a cup base and trading about 9% below its high reached in December.Apple supplier Cavium reports on Wednesday. Wall Street projects earnings to drop 33% on a revenue decline of nearly 1%.Shares hit a 14-month low on Wednesday, and have fallen 13 out of the past 15 sessions. But Cavium rebounded higher in Thursday's session, closing up 3.6%. The stock has a 73 Composite Rating.Fellow Apple supplier Cirrus Logic, with a 90 Composite Rating, is expected to see earnings decline 16% on a 16% revenue rise when it reports next Wednesday. Cirrus Logic slid 1.7% on Thursday.A third Apple supplier, Skyworks Solutions, reports on Thursday. Earnings are expected to grow 25% while sales jump 14%.Shares rose 2.7% on Thursday but are still 44% below their high, contributing to the company's relatively weak 77 Composite Rating.And Microsemi reports on Thursday as well. Earnings are projected to rise 11% while sales grow 8%.Microsemi has a Composite Rating of 88. Shares are trading 24% below their high, but climbed 1.9% Thursday.The vast majority of these estimates mark a slowdown in growth for the companies.

301,SWKS,"Tech stock declines piled on Monday, snowballing after badly received quarterly reports last week from the likes of LinkedIn (LNKD) and Tableau (DATA), whose stocks sheared off. Apple (AAPL) supplier NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), GoPro (GPRO) supplier Ambarella (AMBA) and cybersecurity bigwig Palo Alto Networks (PANW) all were down Monday following a brutal last week, among other decliners.IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group was collectively down 6.9% in afternoon trading. The 41-company Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group was down 2.7%.Ahead of the closing bell on the stock market today, Palo Alto stock was down 9%. Shares of CyberArk Software (CYBR), FireEye (FEYE) and Proofpoint (PFPT) were down about 9%, 9.5% and 10%, respectively.Shares of NXP and Ambarella were down 9.5% and 6.4%, respectively.  Apple suppliers Avago Technologies (AVGO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) both fell more than 5% while Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Qorvo (QRVO) were each down about 2%.Only a handful of stocks escaped the high-tech sell-off -- a continuation of a Friday deluge that saw LinkedIn stock lose nearly half its value on Wall Street after the professional networker announced a low 2016 forecast.Compounding the pressure, analysts see Big Data analytics software maker Tableau losing market share to Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT). Tableau, too, guided to current-quarter sales and earnings that missed the consensus expectation.Security vendors lost 7.4% and fabless chip makers closed down 4% on Friday.NXP's plunge looks incongruous after the Apple chip supplier's Q4 beat last week, but comes on a day when techs are broadly down, and amid an acquisition. In the long run, picking up Freescale is making NXP an automotive powerhouse -- sales in that segment bounded 45% year over year to $422 million.The Freescale deal also halves NXP's Apple iPhone exposure as the smartphone giant deals with floundering demand. Apple chip suppliers Cirrus Logic, Qorvo, Qualcomm (QCOM) and InvenSense (INVN) recently issued March-quarter views that lagged the consensus.At least six analysts this month have rated NXP stock a buy, including two on Monday. A Jefferies analyst boosted his price target on NXP stock to 112 from 107.Ambarella stock sank as GoPro stock rocketed 10% as of Monday afternoon on its partnership with Microsoft. GoPro and Microsoft will partner on a patent-licensing agreement for file storage and other system technologies.""This agreement with GoPro shows the incredible breadth of technology sharing enabled through patent transactions,"" Microsoft's technology licensing president, Nick Psyhogeos, said in a press release.Last week, GoPro stock wiped out after missing Wall Street's Q4 earnings views and guiding well below consensus Q1 expectations. Shares closed down nearly 9% on Feb. 4. But chip maker Ambarella missed the scrum and pulled ahead 5.1% that day.At least seven analysts cut their price targets on GoPro stock following the Q4 report. But at least three reiterated a buy rating, and another boosted his price target.Ambarella tried distancing itself from GoPro during its December quarter, instead highlighting the company's expansion into drones and home security.

304,SWKS,"The steady drip-drip-drip of negative reports on Apple (AAPL) iPhone production and sales continued on Friday. Nomura Securities analyst Jeffrey Kvaal cut his forecasts for iPhone sales for the company's fiscal first and second quarters.""The alarming supply-chain news is impossible to ignore,"" Kvaal said in a note Friday. ""The steady drip of disappointing news flow out of the supply chain has weighed heavily on Apple's share price in recent weeks. Order reductions for some vendors have been as much as 70%.""Kvaal believes Apple ordered too many iPhone 6S-series smartphones for the fall launch and is cutting production to deal with its existing inventory. Current iPhone users haven't upgraded to the newer handsets in the numbers Apple expected, he said. However, the company continues to attract people switching from phones running Alphabet's (GOOGL)Google Android operating system, he said.For the December quarter, Apple's fiscal Q1, Kvaal trimmed his iPhone sales estimate by 2% to 75 million units. For the March quarter, Apple's fiscal Q2, he cut his iPhone sales estimate by 11% to 54 million. For the full fiscal 2016, he reduced his iPhone unit sales estimate by 4% to 234 million.Apple has become over-reliant on the iPhone and will need another sales generator by 2017, he said.""We are cognizant that reliance on a single product is a weak spot in the Apple story,"" he said. ""Efforts to diversify into tablets, watches, services and enterprise markets have been blunted by the continued success of the iPhone, particularly, of course, in China over the past year. We do not wholly excuse Apple — we doubt declining tablet volumes were in the strategic plan. Nevertheless, we do expect Apple to lower its reliance on the iPhone by 2017 if not sooner.""Kvaal remains bullish on Apple's prospects. He rates Apple stock as a buy with a price target of 145. Apple fell 2.4% to 97.13 on an overall rough stock market today. But Apple shares actually rose 0.2% for the week.If Apple shares had a cold, iPhone suppliers such as Avago Technologies (AVGO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) took a sick day. Avago sank 4.2%, Skyworks 6% and NXP Semi 7.9% on Friday.On Thursday, BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk cut his iPhone sales estimates but reiterated his buy rating on Apple stock, with a price target of 160.""Today we join the herd of analysts cutting short-term iPhone estimates, as the noise and consistency of supply-chain data points have become too loud to ignore,"" Piecyk said.He cut his December-quarter iPhone sales estimate by 4 million units to 76 million and his March quarter estimate by 6 million units to 56.5 million. The cuts imply slight unit growth in the December quarter and an 8% decline in the March quarter, he said.Apple is scheduled to report fiscal Q1 results after the market close on Jan. 26.Investors will be focused on Apple's March-quarter guidance for signs of weakening iPhone sales, FBR analyst Daniel Ives said in a report Wednesday.""Once the smoke clears from December results/March guidance, we believe the Street will start to re-rate shares higher in anticipation of pent-up iPhone 7 demand later this year, (along with) improving Watch sales into 2016 and potentially a major step up (incremental $75 billion to $100 billion) in the company's buyback program on the horizon,"" Ives said.Longer term, Apple is working to diversify its business from the iPhone by expanding into enterprise, wearables, virtual reality, streaming and autonomous cars, Ives said.

313,SWKS,"Stocks bucked out of the chutes on Friday, racking up broad early gains as investor optimism got a lift from oil prices, overseas markets and some healthy economic news.The Nasdaq spiked 2.4%. The S&P 500 vaulted 1.9% higher and the Dow Jones industrial average hauled in a 1.4% opening gain. Small caps leaned toward the high end of the action, with the Russell 2000 pumped up 2.4% in early trade.Volume rose, up 27% on the NYSE and 9% higher on Nasdaq vs. trade at the same time Thursday.The stock market today's early redemption rally lifted the Nasdaq 1.4% for the week and the S&P 500 0.9%, putting both within reach of their first weekly gain this year.Oil was a key factor, as West Texas Intermediate oil shot up more than 5%. Brent crude prices spiked past 6%, lifting both back above the $31 per barrel mark and positioning oil prices for their first gain in four weeks. A passel of factors, including possible new stimulus measures in the eurozone and cold weather in the U.S. and Europe, lifted prices for a second day and appeared to squeeze out some short sellers. WTI oil traded up 5.5% for the week and nearly 19% above Tuesday's low.Economic news was also a positive.U.S. manufacturing firmed in January, according to researcher Markit, which placed its preliminary Purchasing Managers Index estimate for January at 52.7, up from 51.3 in December and well above consensus views for a downtick to 51. Output and new business underwrote the gains, Markit said, while employment and inventories eased.New-home sales spiked in December to an annualized rate of 5.46 million. The National Association of Realtors put November's sales rate at 4.76 million homes sold; consensus estimates had called for an increase to a rate of 5.2 million sales for December.Leading economic indicators for December, reported by the Conference Board, fell 0.2%, according to Econoday.

314,SWKS,"Cirrus Logic (CRUS) led a partial Apple (AAPL) chips recovery midday Friday after the chipmaker and rival Qorvo (QRVO) late Thursday lowered their Q3 views on slackening iPhone 6S demand, forcing the sector to plunge on Wall Street.Late Thursday, shares of Apple chip suppliers plummeted with Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Avago Technologies (AVGO) stocks leading the way. That trend reversed Friday.In early trading in the stock market today, Cirrus Logic stock was up more than 5% and trailed by Avago stock, which was up nearly 2%. Shares of Skyworks and Broadcom (BRCM) were up fractionally. Apple stock, which joined its chips in falling Thursday, was trading up about 2.5% intraday Friday.But NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and InvenSense (INVN) felt the brunt of Qorvo's fall. InvenSense stock was down nearly 5%. Shares of Qorvo and NXP followed, down 1.5% and less than 1%, respectively.For its December quarter (fiscal Q3), Qorvo reduced its sales guide to $620 million from earlier projections for $720 million to $730 million. Revenue would be down 16% year over year, and the view missed the model of $723.7 million from 21 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Qorvo also expects March quarter sales to come in flat, quarter-over-quarter.Similarly, Cirrus Logic dropped its fiscal Q3 sales view to $347 million from early forecasts for between $370 million and $400 million. The estimate would be up 16% vs. the year-earlier quarter but misses analyst expectations for $385.95 million.Earbuds To Bolster Cirrus LogicCirrus Logic CEO Jason Rhode still sees meaningful growth in fiscal 2016, according to a statement. The company didn't give March-quarter guidance.Wall Street was decidedly more brutal on Qorvo. At least six analysts on Thursday and Friday cut their price targets on Qorvo stock. Cirrus Logic stock suffered at least one price target cut but also received an upgrade.At least four analysts cut their price targets on Apple stock. Rumors that Apple lowered its iPhone component orders have hounded the smartphone maker for months. On Friday, at least three analysts slashed their iPhone-shipments estimates for the January and March quarters.Pacific Crest analyst Andy Hargreaves dropped his Q1 iPhone shipments estimate to 73 million to 76 million units. Needham analyst N. Quinn Bolton lowered his Q1 and Q2 estimates to 70 million and 45 million iPhones shipped, respectively. Canaccord analyst T. Michael Walkley now expects 46 million shipments in Q1 and 45 million in Q2.Cirrus Logic is more Apple-exposed with 60%-65% of sales stemming from iPhone content, Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer wrote in a research report. But Cirrus Logic is apt to benefit from Apple's likely iPhone 7 headphone jack revamp and noise-canceling headphones, Pacific Crest analyst John Vinh wrote in a report.""Apple needs a compelling feature upgrade, which noise-canceling earbuds would provide,"" Vinh wrote. Other reports suggest that Apple will swap its headphone jack for a Lightning cord-compatible set of earbuds in an effort to create the thinnest smartphone to date.Vinh called the gouge on Cirrus Logic stock a ""buying opportunity"" and upgraded shares to an overweight rating with a 40 price target. Vinh rates Qorvo stock as sector weight.Qorvo: 'In The Penalty Box'Qorvo, on the other hand, is 35%-40% sales-dependent on Apple, Pitzer wrote. But Thursday was Qorvo's second top-line miss in six months as ""peers Avago and Skyworks have continued to beat and raise estimates,"" Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh wrote in a report.Some of Qorvo's miss could be due to an oversized September-quarter ramp-up, which likely built inventory into the already shaky supply chain, Rakesh wrote. Still, he prefers Avago stock, which he lists with a buy rating and a 175 price target.""We believe Qorvo could be in the penalty box with investors near-term,"" he wrote. ""We continue to favor Avago with strong executive, visibility, free cash flow and diversification.""But even Avago expects its Q1 sales to be down 4.5% sequentially at the midpoint of guidance.Analog Devices, too, cut its January-quarter forecast to indicate a 15% quarter-over-quarter revenue slump. German Apple-supplier Dialog Semiconductor, too, trimmed $50 million from its fiscal Q4 sales view in December.But Avago is, uniquely, not at risk, Vinh wrote. He rates Avago stock as overweight and has a price target of 170 on shares.""Avago took its iPhone 6S medicine early,"" he wrote. ""With a clear line of sight to 20% content growth in the iPhone 7 . . . and the closure of the Broadcom merger around the end of the quarter, we would be buyers of Avago.""Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

315,SWKS,"Futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average turn higher Friday after the Nasdaq composite closed Thursday below its 50-day moving average. Microsoft (MSFT) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) fell back below their 50-day lines, joining Apple, Netflix and many others. Some stocks, such as Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN), are holding support. But they are fighting against the tide.Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.4% vs. fair value after falling for much of the overnight session. Futures for the S&P 500 advanced 0.4% and Dow futures climbed 0.35%. Crude futures rose nearly 1% after gaining for several days in a row.XThis year's broad tech rally was fueled by several big trends: FANG+ (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet, plus Apple), China internets, chipmakers, optical gear plays and, more recently, enterprise software firms.But more and more stocks are breaking 50-day lines or round-tripping on breakouts.Apple tumbled below its 50-day moving average on June 10 and hasn't found a way back. Even with recent struggles, including Thursday's 1.5% loss, Apple is still up 24% in 2017, the third-best performer in the Dow Jones industrial average.Microsoft and Alphabet on Tuesday closed just below their 50-day lines and bounced back on Wednesday. On Thursday, both Microsoft and Google's parent fell more decisively below that key support line. Microsoft and Alphabet are among the biggest cloud-computing rivals to much-larger Amazon Web Services.IBD'S TAKE: The market direction is still uptrend under pressure, which means investors should be cautious about taking new positions and ready to take profits and cut losses quickly. Pay attention to the leading stocks and major averages and read The Big Picture daily.Facebook traded below its 50-day line intraday for the fifth time in June, but once again closed above that line. Facebook announced this week that it has topped two billion monthly users. What makes that even more amazing is that the social giant is blocked in China, the world's largest internet market.Amazon has pulled back toward its 50-day line but has found support so far. Amazon continues to roil the retail, apparel and broader consumer fields, with Nike (NKE) confirming in its Thursday night earnings call that it will sell some shoes directly via the e-commerce giant.Weibo (WB) and Momo (MOMO) have fallen below their 50-day lines. NetEase (NTES) is once again round-tripping its late-stage breakout. And Tencent (TCEHY) pulled back into its three-weeks-tight pattern.But Alibaba (BABA) remains strong, and YY (YY) found support above its 50-day and is still in buy range.IBD's semiconductor manufacturing and semiconductor fabless groups have fallen below their 50-day moving averages, a few days after the chip equipment group undercut that level.Apple iPhone chipmakers in particular are struggling. Broadcom (AVGO) finally fell below its 50-day line on Thursday after several other Apple chip plays did the same, including Skyworks (SWKS), Qorvo (QRVO), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Analog Devices (ADI).A slew of top-rated chip equipment makers, including Lam Research (LRCX) and Applied Materials (AMAT), are below their 50-day lines.Nvidia (NVDA) remains a standout.Fiber-optic stocks have been volatile leaders over the past year, as internet giants ramp up data centers, China beefs up infrastructure and Verizon (VZ) expands its high-speed metro broadband networks.But the Telecom-Fiber Optic group has fallen through its 50-day line. Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI), one of the hottest stocks in the group, is finding resistance there this week. Lumentum (LITE), which is seen as a possible Apple iPhone 3D sensor play, is close to round-tripping.Salesforce (CRM), Shopify (SHOP) and SAP (SAP) are all below their 50-day moving averages.Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE), which both had strong earnings last week, are holding up well so far.While many techs are weak, financials are making gains, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) a notable breakout this week. Big banks announced huge dividend hikes and stock buybacks late Wednesday after passing the second round of the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests. Meanwhile, higher Treasury yields, while a negative for the broader stock market (and housing stocks in particular), also are giving a lift to financials.Meanwhile, biotechs have been big winners in June. Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron (REGN) are two big-name breakouts, but there have been others.Defense and aerospace firms like Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) have held up well, either within buy range or just extended.In Asian markets, Japan's Nikkei fell 0.9% and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 1.7% but China's Shanghai composite rose 0.1% 0.2%.

If true, that's weeks after the typical mid-September launch for new iPhones.Pacific Crest analyst Andy Hargreaves on Sunday downgraded Apple stock to sector weight from overweight. Hargreaves believes Wall Street's expectations for iPhone 8 sales are too high.Despite turning bearish on Apple stock, Pacific Crest remains positive on Apple chip suppliers Broadcom (AVGO), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS).IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks includes eight chip-industry players, including Lam Research and Nvidia.

318,SWKS,"XPressure increased on the stock market midday Monday, as the Nasdaq declined more sharply than the S&P 500 and the Dow.The Nasdaq hacked off 0.7%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average each lost 0.3%. The small cap Russell 2000 was flat. Volume in the stock market today was running higher on both major exchanges.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, the lower-ranked groups were scoring the best gains for the day — oil drillers, food and dairy and specialty steel. On the day's downside, chip stocks and internet retail were sinking fastest.Other retailers were doing better. Under Armour (UAA) surged about 4%. Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) popped 2%. Williams-Sonoma (WSM) advanced 2%. Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) added 2%. Kohl's (KSS) rose 3%. All were rising in above-average volume.Starbucks (SBUX), though, was headed for a sixth consecutive loss. The stock broke out in April and advanced 9% before pulling about 5% off the high. Midday Monday the stock was finding support at its 50-day line. The restaurant group began the week No. 33 among 197 industry groups.Chip stocks, the No. 1 sector going into Monday's action, were suffering.

319,SWKS,"Apple (AAPL) chip suppliers Broadcom (AVGO), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) are three companies likely to benefit from Apple's upcoming iPhone 8, Pacific Crest Securities said in a report Friday.""Despite increasing concerns related to an iPhone delay, we recommend investors continue to own (Broadcom, Cirrus and Skyworks),"" Pacific Crest said in a report.The brokerage said Apple could still make up unit sales later in the year and has an opportunity for multiple expansion associated with iPhone 8 as it has in past cycles. Pacific Crest sees continued opportunities for content expansion through such areas as 5G and voice biometrics. Pacific Crest rates Broadcom, Cirrus Logic and Skyworks shares as overweight.The iPhone 8 is expected to be announced in September, but some analysts believe it will be severely supply-constrained at launch and might even be delayed. Apple's contract manufacturers reportedly have had problems making the OLED displays and integrating a fingerprint sensor into the new display.Pacific Crest believes there is a pent-up demand for the iPhone 8 among current iPhone users looking to upgrade.The iPhone 8, Apple's 11th-generation handset, is seen as the biggest revamp since the iPhone 6, which debuted in September 2014. The iPhone 8 is rumored to feature a 5.8-inch borderless OLED display, augmented-reality capability and wireless charging. It is expected to sport a sleek glass-sandwich design and no physical home button.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks includes eight chip-industry players including Cirrus Logic and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.Audio-chip maker Cirrus Logic has the highest exposure to Apple of the three chip stocks spotlighted by Pacific Crest. Cirrus gets about 75% of its revenue from Apple.""We believe Cirrus stands to benefit from unit upside associated with the new iPhone,"" Pacific Crest said. ""Longer term, we see opportunity for content growth associated with content gains from voice biometrics.""Broadcom is best positioned to make content gains in the iPhone 8 with its radio-frequency, Wi-Fi and wireless charging chips, Pacific Crest said. Broadcom gets 15% to 20% of its revenue from Apple.Skyworks also is seen making content gains in the new iPhone, Pacific Crest said. The company recently has made content gains in smartphones from Samsung and Huawei. Skyworks gets about 40% of its revenue from Apple.Pacific Crest has price targets of 260 on Broadcom, 75 on Cirrus Logic, and 120 on Skyworks.Broadcom rose 2.1% to 235.96 on the stock market today, hitting an all-time high of 236.05 intraday. It broke out of a flat base with a buy point of 227.85 on May 9.Cirrus Logic was down 0.5% to 63.96, undercutting a 64.26 buy point from a cup base cleared on April 4.Skyworks dipped 0.1% to 102.52 on Friday.

321,SWKS,"Avago Technologies (AVGO) stock steamrolled the IBD Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group in 2015, rocketing 45% since January on its chipmaking link to the golden smartphone goose. But other Apple (AAPL) suppliers weren't as lucky.Qualcomm (QCOM) and Qorvo (QRVO) stocks have plunged 32% and 22%, respectively, since January. Both trail their IBD performance groups in spades and face ongoing Asian headwinds that include a challenge from China's Tsinghua Unigroup to unseat Qualcomm from its No. 3 chip slot.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), too, underperformed its IBD Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group, by rising 2% in 2015 vs. the group's collective 3% rise.And every supplier, according to analysts, will likely feel hunger pangs as Apple appears likely to cut its orders in the typically tough March quarter while facing an iPhone sales drought.Intraday on the stock market today, nearly every Apple chip supplier dipped and Cirrus Logic (CRUS) stock led the way as shares fell about 3% ahead of the new year. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) stock followed and was down 1.5% midday Thursday.Broadcom (BRCM) and Taiwan Semiconductor stocks, alone, managed to stay in the green and were up fractionally in midday trading.Avago's Blowout 2015Without a doubt, Avago had a blowout 2015 and consistently topped quarterly Wall Street views. The chipmaker ended its fiscal year 2015 (in November) with $8.98 earnings per share ex items on $6.9 billion in sales, up 83% and 60% vs. 2014.In December, eight analysts rated Avago stock a buy.But the company's growth is slowing. During the first half of 2015, Avago posted triple-digit earnings and sales growth. In Q3 and Q4, those numbers braked to double-digit growth. Now the consensus of 26 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters largely expects single-digit growth in 2016.The $37 billion plan to acquire Broadcom could buoy those figures. Avago announced its plan to acquire Apple rival Broadcom in May, shortly after it promised to buy data connector Emulex for $606 million in February. The deal is expected to close in Q1.Avago's Broadcom deal was one of more than $100 billion in chip sector deals in 2015. Analysts say semiconductor M&A activity will continue in 2016 as, such is Avago's plight, growth slows, competition mounts and the economy lags.Qualcomm Snagged In ChinaChinese licensing negotiations pummeled Qualcomm in 2015 and led to an internal review spurred by activist investor JANA Partners that would have seen the chipmaker split.But Qualcomm recently decided against jettisoning its licensing business. CEO Steve Mollenkopf told investors earlier this month, ""The strategic benefits of our model are not replicable through alternative structures.""That model has caused particular ire in China. Qualcomm settled an anti-monopoly suit with China's National Development and Reform Commission in February but has since struggled to collect royalties from Chinese smartphone makers.""We believe in connection with the negotiations, (some licensees) have stopped reporting certain of their sales and royalties or did not report their sales and royalties in a manner that allows us to record revenue,"" Qualcomm President Derek Aberle told investors in November.Authorities in Taiwan have since launched an antitrust investigation into Qualcomm's licensing business, following in the footsteps of similar probes in China and South Korea. The European Commission also recently alleged that Qualcomm paid a major customer to use its chips exclusively and engaged in ""predatory pricing"" to force competitors out of the market.For its fiscal Q4, Qualcomm reported an 18% dip in sales to $5.5 billion and 91 cents EPS minus items, down 28% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Both measures, however, beat the consensus model.Qualcomm ended fiscal 2015 with $25.3 billion in sales and $4.66 EPS minus items, down 5% and 12%, respectively, vs. fiscal 2014. The consensus of 36 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters currently sees Qualcomm's fiscal 2016 sales and EPS ex items dropping 8% and 11%, respectively.Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

The products have ""gained very small traction to date.""But Qualcomm and Skyworks stocks each suffered price-target cuts Thursday on ""growing concerns over weak iPhone 6S sales,"" Stoss wrote.Apple Supplier Cuts GuidanceIn the stock market today, Skyworks closed up 3.8% at 64.54, but Qorvo stock fell 2.4% to 39.42. Qualcomm stock closed up 3.5% at 47.73.Stoss cut his price target on Skyworks stock to 100 from 125 after shares fell to a 14-month low Wednesday on Apple supplier Multi-Fineline Electronix's (MFLX) soft Q4 sales guidance.Multi-Fineline stock crashed 22% on Wednesday, hitting an 11-month low, after the company guided to $169 million in Q4 sales vs. its previous views for $170 million to $200 million. The company blamed soft smartphone sales for the floundering view. Shares rebounded 15.6% Thursday.Poor Apple iPhone sales will undoubtedly smudge Skyworks' top line, says Stoss, but he sees the company benefiting from a 15%-20% boost in RF content per unit over the next year and two-year visibility on all flagship phones.""Moreover, we believe the new features rumored to come in the iPhone 7 this fall could re-accelerate iPhone unit growth quickly, turning Apple headwinds into Apple tailwinds,"" he wrote.Meanwhile, Samsung is preparing to ramp its Galaxy S7, which should benefit Qualcomm, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh wrote in a report Thursday.

In September, Qualcomm reported an 18% year-over-year sales dip as a result of companies' reluctance to enter new government-approved contracts.The new contracts ""should enable Qualcomm to receive currently due and retroactive royalty and licensing payments,"" Kelleher wrote.Still, Qualcomm stock has pulled back 5% since New Year's Day after falling 33% in 2015, lagging the 8% gain of its 43-company IBD Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless industry group.But Kelleher is more positive on Qualcomm stock than is Craig-Hallum's Stoss. The market tends to overlook Qualcomm's positives and on Wednesday largely shrugged at the TDK alliance, Kelleher wrote.""In December, we wrote that, given all the M&A in semiconductors, we would not be surprised to see Qualcomm make a major acquisition,"" he wrote. ""Formation of the RF360 Holdings JV spares Qualcomm the expense of a major asset buy while positioning the company to meaningfully increase its content per device.""Kelleher maintained his buy rating on Qualcomm stock but cut his price target to 70 from 80.Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

332,SWKS,"Stocks gained momentum Thursday, led once again by strong gains by Apple. The largest company in the U.S. by market cap powered 3% higher to 115.19, padding its gains from Wednesday's high-volume breakout.The Nasdaq composite rose 1% while the S&P 500 and Dow industrials climbed 0.6%, shaking off larger-than-expected declines in U.S. retail sales and industrial output. Gains by Goldman Sachs (GS), Chevron (CVX) and Intel (INTC) helped the Dow, though Apple is the big driver.The Russell 2000 gained 0.5%.Apple (AAPL) investors brushed off headlines from telecom giant Verizon (VZ) that its preorders for the iPhone 7 were not as remarkable as the gains seen at rival wireless carriers. Apple, meanwhile, says it's not going to report early numbers on the new iPhone given that it's repeatedly had a tough time meeting overwhelming demand, resulting in supply shortages and skewed short-term figures.While Apple shares are acting the way a good breakout should for now, it's imperative not to chase the stock more than 5% beyond the 110.33 proper buy point, or in other words beyond the 115.85 price level. Buying a stock extended -- say, 10% or 15% above where you should buy a high-growth stock -- can leave you high and dry when the stock decides to stage a normal pullback. Also keep in mind the market uptrend remains under pressure which makes new buys risky.Based on IBD research, in most cases, great stocks in bull markets won't pull back more than 7% to 8% below the proper buy point. So, buying shares at 10% or 15% above the right entry could force you to sell shares based on IBD's golden rule when it's normal to sit tight and be patient because the stock is doing nothing wrong. Roughly four of 10 major stock winners retreat back to or near their proper pivot point before resuming their awesome rallies.Companies believed to supply technology to Apple's iPhone and other products joined the company's rebound. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), a big winner in 2013-14, gapped up at the open and jumped nearly 6% to 76.61 in fast trading.

"
337,SWKS,"Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7 news is seen as positive for Broadcom (AVGO), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Intel (INTC), but negative for Qualcomm (QCOM), according to Wall Street analysts.The iPhone 7 supports 25 radio-frequency bands vs. 23 bands in the iPhone 6S series.""Overall the increased RF content should remain a tailwind for RF suppliers as other handset (manufacturers) emulate the iPhone road map,"" Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh said in a research report. The increased bands in the iPhone 7 will be especially positive for Broadcom, he said.The increased bands should benefit all RF suppliers, but Broadcom and Qorvo (QRVO) will benefit more than Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri said.IBD'S TAKE: Among Apple chip suppliers seen benefiting from the iPhone 7 launch, only Broadcom is on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks.Audio chipmaker Cirrus Logic will profit from Apple's decision to remove the analog audio jack from the iPhone 7 and include digital earbuds and an adapter with the new handset, Pacific Crest Securities analyst John Vinh said in a report.Cirrus Logic also will benefit from Apple adding a second speaker to the iPhone 7 to give it stereo sound, he said.""We anticipate an incremental $2.50 in content associated with the Lightning earpods, Lightning adapter and second stereo speaker,"" Vinh said. ""Despite the significant content increase, we believe much of this has already been built into guidance and stock expectations.""For that reason, he is sector weight, or neutral, on Cirrus Logic stock.It is unclear whether Cirrus Logic has content in Apple's new wireless earbuds called AirPods, Vinh noted. AirPods will go on sale in late October for $159 a pair.His ""favorite Apple-exposed suppliers"" are Analog Devices (ADI), Broadcom, InvenSense (INVN) and Skyworks.Suppliers getting content boosts from the iPhone 7 likely include ADI and Broadcom, RBC Capital Markets said in a report.ADI could get about 30% more content in the iPhone 7 vs. the iPhone 6S series after winning a processor for the camera module, RBC said. Analog Devices gets about 13% of its revenue from Apple.Broadcom also could see a 30% boost in content in the iPhone 7, RBC said. Broadcom gets about 15% to 18% of its revenue from Apple.The iPhone 7 is a negative for Qualcomm, because it could lose 20% to 25% of its baseband chip share in the new smartphone to Intel, BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long said in a report.Qualcomm is supplying CDMA versions of the iPhone 7 and Intel is supplying non-CDMA versions, which is based on the wireless technologies carriers use.Apple's iPhone 7 is seen as positive for memory suppliers Micron Technology (MU) and Western Digital (WDC) because the new handsets feature twice as much Nand flash data storage as last year's models.The iPhone 7 series has data storage from 32 gigabytes to 256 GB vs. the prior 16 GB to 128 GB.""Doubling Nand storage could further tighten Nand supply and set a trend toward 256-GB handset densities,"" Mizuho's Rakesh said. ""The increased Nand storage should drive further pricing and margin stability in an already tight Nand supply chain, which is a clear positive for MU and WDC.""Apple shares finished 2.6% lower on stock market today at 105.52, as its announcement carried few surprises. Broadcom dipped 0.3%, Qualcomm rose 0.4%, Intel was essentially flat, Cirrus Logic eased 0.15%, while Micron gained 1.7%.RELATED:Apple iPhone 7 Launch Not 'Insanely Great,' But 'Good Enough'
"
338,SWKS,"Apple (AAPL) iPhone 6S demand improved in July, but a shift to the lower-end iPhone SE could pressure Apple's component suppliers such as Cirrus Logic (CRUS), Qorvo (QRVO) and Synaptics (SYNA), Pacific Crest analysts said Friday.Meanwhile, Analog Devices (ADI), Broadcom (AVGO) and InvenSense (INVN) will withstand a looming 15%-20% cut on iPhone 7 component orders, but not because of any changes in Apple trends.In July, carriers had six days of iPhone 6S inventory on hand, dropping from a year-high of nine days in April, the investment bank said in a research note. Meanwhile, iPhone SE demand normalized, rising from north of one day in May and June to six days in July.Pacific Crest targets six to 10 days of on-hand inventory for carriers. Inventory rocketed early in the year, as Apple experienced its first dip in iPhone sales.""Carrier store inventory declined month over month to the low end of our target,"" Pacific Crest analysts wrote in a research report. ""We view this as encouraging ahead of the iPhone 7 launch in September.""But that launch, expected next month, comes with a muted forecast. Pacific Crest sees component orders declining 15%-20% for the iPhone 7 vs. its predecessor iPhone 6S in 2015.Many chipmakers, including Apple suppliers Analog Devices, InvenSense, Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Texas Instruments (TXN), during their most recent earnings calls, predicted slower year-over-year demand for their consumer/mobile units.""We're not expecting ... any outlandish unit growth in the mobile market,"" Cirrus Logic CEO Jason Rhode said on the company's fiscal Q1 earnings conference call on July 27. ""We've got something of a content story this year.""IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom ranks No. 1 in IBD's 41-company Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. The group has climbed to No. 10 out of 197 groups tracked, up from No. 65 only 13 weeks ago. Get IBD's Stock Checkup to examine individual chipmakers.Pacific Crest maintained sector weight ratings on Cirrus Logic, Qorvo, Skyworks Solutions and Synaptics. The likely transition to digital headsets is already baked into Cirrus Logic stock, and the more conservative iPhone 7 cycle will offset content gains for Qorvo, analysts wrote.Synaptics, on the other hand, is poised for share loss at Apple, Pacific Crest predicted. Synaptics supplies a touch-chip for Apple iPhones, but that could be at risk as Apple reportedly makes the move to OLED (organic light-emitting diode) screens in 2017.OLED technology allow for thinner and more flexible screens, but they are also double the cost of LCD (liquid crystal diode) screens, which Apple uses now. The switch will likely add $30 to $35 to the total bill of materials for the iPhone 8, analysts say.""We believe there could be risk that Apple looks to squeeze its other component suppliers on price in order to recoup the incremental BOM associated with the OLED display,"" the Pacific Crest analysts wrote.In the meantime, Apple suppliers such as Analog Devices, Broadcom and InvenSense stand to outperform, Pacific Crest said. It has overweight ratings on all three stocks.Broadcom is positioned to benefit from the carrier aggregation trend as more infrastructure is built to support 4G and LTE, says Pacific Crest. Analog Devices recently announced its $14.8 billion plan to acquire Linear Technology (LLTC), a move that cuts its Apple exposure. InvenSense is gaining on augmented reality trends such as with the mobile game ""Pokemon Go,"" they said.On the stock market today, Analog Devices rose 0.4% and Synaptics 0.2%. Shares of Cirrus Logic fell 0.2% while Broadcom climbed 0.6% and Skyworks 0.7%. InvenSense stock was down 1.6%, and Qorvo stock was weaker by 0.55%.RELATED:Broadcom Likely Gained 20% Apple iPhone 7 Content Despite 'Muted' RampApple's Smartphone Profit Share Slipping Vs.

"
340,SWKS,"It seems Broadcom (AVGO) just can't resist making merger deals -- whether joining forces with another company or shedding some of its own operations.The supplier to Apple (AAPL) iPhones seemed set after making its mammoth $37 billion deal to merge with Avago earlier this year. In March, a mere month after the transaction closed, Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan spurned any talk of future transactions. Tan told analysts a merger or acquisition was the ""furthest thing"" from his mind.That was then. Tan's tune changed a couple months later when he told analysts on the June 2 second-quarter conference call that Broadcom will pull excess cash for mergers, as gross debt is close to double its adjusted earnings. Broadcom, the No. 2 fabless chipmaker, is still trying to buffer itself from volatile smartphone sales and angle for the more stable wired segment.Analysts say the merger strategy is working. Morgan Stanley's Craig Hettenbach notes the company now has greater diversification, with a hand in wireless, wired, enterprise storage and industrial segments.""The ebb and flow between Broadcom's end markets has allowed the company to meet revenue expectations in recent quarters despite the overriding demand weakness that has had a negative impact on most peers,"" Hettenbach wrote in a June 3 research report.Broadcom is far from new to the merger block. In fact, the company has changed hands several times itself since it was founded in 1961 as a semiconductor division under Hewlett-Packard. It left when Agilent Technologies (A) split from the company in 1999.Six years later, KKR and Silver Lake paid $2.6 billion to acquire the division of Agilent that later became Avago. Before going public in 2009, Avago sold one of its divisions to PMC-Sierra. PMC, in turn, was acquired early this year by Microsemi (MSCC).Eight years of rampant merger deals followed. In 2013, Avago acquired optical chip supplier CyOptics for $400 million and storage/networking firm LSI for $6.6 billion. Meanwhile, Avago peeled off several layers of its own by selling divisions to Intel (INTC) and Seagate Technology (STX). Then it turned the tables and bought Emulex in 2015 for $606 million.Earlier this year, Broadcom divested its Internet of Things and wireless infrastructure units to Cypress Semiconductor (CY) and MaxLinear (MXL) in deals worth a combined $630 million. Broadcom is likely to use those proceeds to pay down debt before seeking another deal.But the Big Kahuna was Avago's merger with the former Broadcom. That acquisition wrapped in February and was one of a number of chip-sector deals worth a cumulative $115 billion. (Intel bought Altera for $17 billion, and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) took on Freescale Semiconductors for $12 billion.)Combined, the new company kept Broadcom's name but used Avago's ticker, AVGO. The move helped it to diversify, and analysts thus changed their tune on the stock. In 2017, RBC analyst Amit Daryanani expects Broadcom to make a play for larger assets like Maxim Integrated (MXIM), NXP or Xilinx (XLNX).At least 16 analysts rated Broadcom stock a buy in the week following its Q2 earnings release, the first quarter in which the two companies were consolidated. Meanwhile, shareholders busted Broadcom stock out of a cup formation on June 3. Shares rocketed 7.7% before dipping almost immediately into a second cup. Broadcom stock topped a 166 entry point on July 27, but it has since pulled back.Broadcom shares ended Friday trading at a new all-time high of 170.12, up 1.9%, but lost some ground Monday. Shares finished Monday's trades down 1% to 168.35.Wireless sales accounted for a mere 22% of total revenue -- dipping below 30% for the first time in seven quarters. Broadcom's smartphone-facing unit accounted for 37% of sales in 2015. In 2014 and 2013, wireless revenue was 42% and 49% of total sales.Despite slowing importance to Broadcom's overall scheme, Tan hinted that radio-frequency content for smartphones has increased and would likely continue to rise by 20% annually for the next two to three years. That means even as smartphone units slow, Broadcom could see its take per phone grow.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom tops IBD's 41-company Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry group. The group has climbed to No. 20 out of 197 groups tracked from No. 74 two months ago. Get Broadcom's IBD Stock Checkup here.UBS analyst Stephen Chin estimates that Broadcom could see its dollar content per unit boost to $8-$10 in the long term. Growth will come from additional content at existing tier-one smartphone makers like Apple and Samsung and as more infrastructure comes online to support 4G and LTE devices worldwide.""This could drive the need for additional FBAR (film bulk acoustic resonator) filters,"" Chin wrote in a July 15 research report. FBAR filters are a common component used in advanced smartphones. The filters account for about 12% of Broadcom's sales, Chin estimated.Broadcom's three-year agreement with Apple for chips ""suggests it will remain the FBAR market leader,"" Chin said. In a July 8 note to clients, RBC's Daryanani estimated that Broadcom's Apple-tied sales could grow more than 15% over the next three years.Diversification is key for RF suppliers like Broadcom, Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO), which are jockeying for position as mobile sales stagnate. Vendors shipped 343.3 million smartphones in the second quarter, flat vs. last year, industry tracker IDC wrote in a July 28 note. Sequentially, smartphone shipments were up 3.1% from the first quarter.Still, mobile giants like Apple are changing their game to focus on services, IDC analyst Ryan Reith says. As smartphone makers shift strategies, so too do chipmakers.For Broadcom that means greater emphasis on its wired segment, which made up 58% of sales in the second quarter, accelerating from 22% of sales in the first quarter. Its previous three-year quarterly average in that unit was 22% of sales. Broadcom has beat Wall Street's total sales expectations for the past seven quarters.Broadcom's wired unit is largely enterprise-facing. The segment includes Broadcom's Tomahawk chips for cloud-scale networking and its Jericho platform for routing. Jericho will drive additional upside to top-line expectations for the third quarter, UBS' Chin said.""We estimate Jericho has started ramping recently and there is virtually no alternative chip supplier in the market,"" he wrote. ""The main competition is from networking OEM internal ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) designs.""

341,SWKS,"Qorvo (QRVO) reacted faster than most to slow sales of the Apple (AAPL) iPhone 6S and took market share from rival Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) in the upcoming iPhone 7, analysts said, but gross profit margins last quarter and this quarter speak of challenges ahead, and Qorvo stock fell sharply Wednesday despite its earnings beat last Tuesday.Qorvo stock tumbled 10.3% to 55.12 in the stock market today, tumbling below its 50-day average. The stock briefly fell back in a buy zone from a cup-with-handle breakout on June 1 at a 52.05 buy point. Since then, however, shares rose as high as 64.80 on July 27, a 52-week high, up 24.5% from the buy point and well past the 20% gains at which investors are advised to lock in at least some profits.Late Tuesday, Qorvo reported better-than-expected revenue and earnings per share minus items for its fiscal Q1 ended July 2, and its guidance for the current quarter also beat Wall Street views, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.IBD'S TAKE: Qorvo ranks No. 4 in its big industry group, with a Composite Rating of 91 that puts it among the top 9% of all stocks in key metrics like sales growth. Earnings growth, however, is its one red flag, as you can learn at IBD Stock Checkup.But the company's Q1 gross margin minus items of 48.2% missed views for 50.1%, and its margin guidance for the current quarter also fell short.Qorvo sales did better than expected in China, analysts said, but the weak profit margin was ""due to poor yields on quadplexers being shipped into Chinese smartphones,"" Pacific Crest Securities analyst John Vinh said in a research note late Tuesday. ""Qorvo cited lower SAW filter yields as the primary culprit,"" but is taking remedies to fix the problem.Quadplexers and SAW (surface acoustic wave) filters are used to eliminate radio frequency interference in mobile communications. Qorvo is a leading provider of RF chips for smartphones and other devices.Vinh also wrote that ""Qorvo reaffirmed expectations for content growth in the iPhone 7,"" and that it had ""faced the iPhone 6S inventory correction earlier than its peers,"" but he maintained a sector weight rating on Qorvo stock.Qorvo's solid guidance ""confirms our belief that Qorvo has taken market share from Skyworks in the iPhone 7,"" wrote Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang in a research note Wednesday.""We believe it is a positive sign that Qorvo has taken market share in the iPhone 7, but on the other hand, Qorvo might face more volatility over the next two quarters due to our cautiousness on overall iPhone sales,"" Zhang said. ""We are mid-term positive on Qorvo as we expect their BAW (bulk acoustic wave) and SAW filter products to ramp, but in the near run, the increasing smartphone supply chain headwinds from China's inventory correction bring equal risk to all smartphone components.""Apple stock rose 1.25% to 105.79.

342,SWKS,"LAS VEGAS -- The speed limit of a Terminator is 25 miles per hour, quipped Jeff Melrose, principal technology strategist for Yokogawa US, on Wednesday. And the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration just ruled it illegal to shoot down a drone.But that's not what Melrose finds most disconcerting about the rapid acceleration (both literal and figurative) of drone technology. DJI's Phantom 4 Drone, a newbie to the market, has a three-mile range, 24-minute-plus flight time and can travel 45 mph.It can also track people.""No one expects the e-chainsaw,"" Melrose told a several-hundred-thick crowd at the Black Hat cybersecurity conference in Las Vegas. ""Drones allow (digital) attacks at a long distance, and drones can tailgate workers as easily as people.""Electronic warfare may come across as a trope out of Arnold Schwarzenegger's most famous series, but it's rooted in reality, Melrose said. And corporate espionage is just as much a certainty as that of nation-state actors.New Jersey truck driver Gary Bojczak was neither, but in 2013 he found himself in hot water after buying a jammer to thwart his company's GPS tracking efforts.The jammer worked too well. Bojczak's work took him near Newark Liberty Airport where his jammer -- a sub-$100 device -- shuttered a GPS-based guidance system. Federal authorities fined him $32,000 after tracing the signal to his truck.Drones compound the problem, Melrose says. Operating on the inverse square law, the closer a transmitter gets to a network, the stronger it becomes. Drones carrying transmitters can get really close ... and fences mean absolutely nothing when your weapon flies.A drone like DJI's newest iteration tracks moving objects autonomously and is capable of bringing a transmitter close enough to cause interference. Jammers are illegal, Melrose noted. But corporate spying and sabotage is nothing new.Industrial-tied businesses should secure overhead access and be aware of gaps in the wireless spectrum that roving electronic warmongers might skip. Interference isn't the only attack vector. A drone can steal visible information or perch for long-term surveillance.""You might only have 25 minutes of flying time, but once it's sitting there, it can virtually record forever,"" he said. ""You have to start telling your physical security guys to check in odd places. You might find drones hanging out in strange places.""Last month at the Warsaw Summit, the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance (NATO) officially recognized cyberspace as a military domain. That's important in Ukraine, where Russian forces have occupied portions of the country since 2014.That's also important more broadly where peacetime countries now face many decisions regarding peacetime hacking and the extent of allowable surveillance, says Kenneth Geers, a senior research scientist for security firm Comodo, who is based in Ukraine.""What can you do in peacetime? How do the laws of war apply in cyberspace?"" he asked. ""We have to get busy in peacetime if you want to be successful in wartime. That means you need a clearly stated policy of deterrence and the ability to enforce policy against your adversary.""Although Ukraine isn't a NATO member, it's likely some of those parallels will play out there. Over the past two years, the death toll in Ukraine has rocketed into the thousands. Now, armed with ""weapons of mass disruption,"" both sides are entering the digital realm.In 2014, a virus crippled Ukraine's Central Election Commission system ahead of the presidential election, and last December, hackers cut power to more than 230,000 people. Both countries have hacked smart billboards to display their own messaging.Closer to home, the Democratic National Committee discovered in June that it had been hacked by two cyber-espionage groups with alleged ties to Russian military intelligence. One had been in the system for years, according to cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. The other, for months.The key takeaway, says Geers, is that cyber warfare exists. And the digital front could soon intensify ground strikes, he said.""Hackers could turn out the lights for a while and confuse leadership,"" he said. ""Or the enemy has a zero day for an application on which you are dependent. Then, it might be a very long day on the battlefield.""It's not necessarily that Apple's (AAPL) iPhones are more secure than their Android counterparts, say Atredis Partners founders Shawn Moyer and Josh Thomas. The Cupertino, Calif.-based tech giant is simply better than Android at deploying updates.That's because Android is vastly more fragmented than Apple, running several operating systems vs. Apple's singular iOS.But those updates can only go so far if the hardware is infected, Moyer and Thomas said. From an internal perspective, Apple and Android aren't dramatically different. Chipmakers like Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) supply the lot.And the vast majority -- Windows and BlackBerry (BBRY) included -- share hardware-based security measures like TrustZone and Boot Loader, both of which are handled on the processor. So a bug impacting Qualcomm's system-on-a-chip could, theoretically, disrupt 60% of the phones on the market today.Exploits gouging TrustZone and Boot Loader circumvent mobile-device management, which pushes out software updates but can do little for a hardware-based bug, Moyer said. As the Bring Your Own Device trend burgeons, he suggested enterprises only support devices running the newest operating system.Therein lies Apple's dominance. For years, Android only pushed patches every six months. But that's too infrequent in today's attack landscape, they said. Apple users are better trained to accept updates transmitted digitally, leaving the fragmented Android market twirling in the wind.Android users aren't acquiescing to vendors' hopes that they'll upgrade their smartphones every two years. Go to a cafe in Nairobi, Moyer says, ""You're going to see people using handsets you haven't seen for years."" That's unfortunate because Android often stops supporting older devices.""Almost every Apple device that's deployed is on the newest version or one version back,"" he said. ""People are saying Apple is winning security. This is one reason why. They're not necessarily better at security, they're just better at pushing upgrades.""

420,SWKS,"Late Tuesday, Apple (AAPL) iPhone chip supplier Qorvo (QRVO) is expected to report fiscal Q1 sales and earnings that toppled into the red vs. last year, but shares dawdled Monday for a fourth straight day, extended at least 20% from a buy point, a zone at which investors might want to lock in at least some profits.Qorvo stock is 21% extended from a 52.05 buy point out of a cup-with-handle formation achieved June 1. Shares rose 24% in 2016 year to date through Friday, and they closed up 0.4% at 63.47 on the stock market today.The company created from the January 2015 merger of TriQuint Semiconductor and RF Micro Devices is slated to report fiscal Q1 earnings after the close Tuesday. Analysts expect Qorvo to report $650.6 million in sales and $1.05 earnings per share ex items, each metric down 4% from the year-earlier period.Qorvo has guided to $650 million in sales and $1.05 EPS ex items.Sales declined for the first time in eight quarters in fiscal Q4, ended in March. And EPS fell for the second consecutive period. Analysts expect both metrics to re-accelerate and grow in fiscal Q2.IBD'S TAKE: Qorvo has an IBD Composite Rating of 89, meaning it performs in the top 11% of all stocks in terms of key metrics. IBD's 38-company Electronic-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group is ranked No. 70 out of 197 groups tracked, climbing from No. 163 over two months.Last month, a Mizuho analyst predicted Intel (INTC) would source a third of Apple's iPhone 7 modems, displacing incumbent Qualcomm (QCOM) in some units. That would benefit Qorvo but hurt Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), said the Mizuho report.Qorvo has a ""legacy relationship"" in making chips compatible with Intel chips.

421,SWKS,"Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) stock dipped late Thursday after the Apple (AAPL) iPhone chip supplier reported fiscal Q3 sales and earnings that topped Wall Street expectations but fell on a year-over-year basis.The company guided to another year-over-year decline in both the top and bottom lines for the current quarter, but its earnings outlook edged analyst views and sales met views.In after-hours trading, after its earnings release, Skyworks stock was down 3%. Shares rose 2.1% in Thursday's regular session, to 70.95.For its fiscal Q3 ended July 1, Skyworks reported $1.24 earnings per share ex items on $751.7 million in sales. Both metrics fell 7% vs. the year-earlier quarter, but narrowly topped the Wall Street consensus for $1.21 and $750.2 million.The company also announced a 28-cent per-share quarterly cash dividend, an 8% increase from the prior 26-cent dividend. The dividend is payable on Aug. 25 to shareholders of record as of the close Aug. 4, Skyworks said.CEO Liam Griffin, in a statement, cited smartphone content gains and expansion into Internet of Things markets for Skyworks' fiscal Q3 beat. Skyworks supplies chips for Apple, Samsung, Huawei, Lenovo and Xiaomi. In IoT, Inotera recently tapped Skyworks to power GPS-enabled tracking devices.Skyworks guided to current-quarter sales ex items of $831 million, down 6% but meeting the consensus of 24 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. It sees EPS ex items of $1.43, also down 6% but a penny above analyst views.Skyworks stock is down 8% for the year, where IBD's 38-company Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry group is up 4%. But the group ranks just No. 103 out of 197 groups tracked, falling from No. 80 in the past week.

422,SWKS,"Apple (AAPL) upped its Cirrus Logic (CRUS) content for the upcoming iPhone by 40% per unit, Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill said Thursday, after Cirrus Logic's late Wednesday beat-and-raise pushed shares to an all-time high.But Qualcomm (QCOM) displaced Cirrus Logic in the majority of Samsung's phones, causing portable audio sales to dip 8% year over year to $216.07 million. Still, those sales grew 15% sequentially, meaning Cirrus Logic is on track to hit its 15% target for fiscal 2017, Gill says.Cirrus Logic stock jumped 19% to close at 49.82 on the stock market today. Shares are 30% extended from a 38.24 entry point out of a cup-with-handle base achieved July 8. Investors are typically advised to take some profits at 20%.IBD'S TAKE: Cirrus Logic stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 80, meaning it performs in the top 20% of all stocks in terms of key metrics. It's in IBD's 41-company Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry group, which ranks No. 23 out of 197 groups tracked.For its fiscal Q1, Cirrus Logic reported 44 cents earnings per share ex items on $259.4 million in sales, down a respective 19% and 8% vs. last year. But both metrics crushed the consensus for $236.4 million and 28 cents.Current-quarter sales guidance for $380 million to $410 million would grow 29% at the midpoint, beating analysts' model for $322.6 million. Cirrus Logic didn't provide an EPS estimate, but the consensus put earnings at 66 cents a share, up a penny year over year.That guidance indicates a 40% dollar-content increase in Apple's iPhone 7 vs. the iPhone 6S which debuted in September 2015, Gill wrote in a research report. He reiterated his buy rating and boosted his price target to 55 from 50 on Cirrus Logic stock.Gill expects Cirrus Logic to see another 30% increase in chip content in the iPhone 8, expected to launch in fall 2017. Analysts have long-speculated Apple will eliminate the 3.5-millimeter headphone jack in the iPhone 7 and introduce noise-cancelling headphones in the iPhone 8.""At Apple, we believe Cirrus Logic is also well-positioned next year for the iPhone 8, which we believe will be the 'super' upgrade cycle,"" he wrote. ""Units should grow year over year.""Cirrus Logic could also see $450 million to $500 million in incremental Android sales over the next several years, Gill predicted. For fiscal 2018, Cirrus Logic will likely expand into mid-tier smartphones, see higher sales of noise-cancelling chipsets and additional amplifier sales.He forecasts 12% sequential growth in the September quarter as Apple ramps the iPhone 7 and a 30% sequential decline in March as it comes off that ramp.Pacific Crest's John Vinh agrees on Cirrus Logic's likely dollar-content gain in the iPhone 7 -- he models a 70% increase at an additional $2.50 per unit -- but isn't as bullish on Apple's upcoming smartphone.""Consistent with results seen from Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Texas Instruments (TXN), AMS AG, Knowles and Dialog Semiconductor, Cirrus noted that it was seeing a more cautious iPhone 7 ramp compared to last year,"" he wrote in a report.Last week, Skyworks offered September-quarter EPS and sales guidance in line with Wall Street estimates, but which would both decline 6% vs. last year. Texas Instruments' Q3 guidance  this week topped analysts' views, but its strength in Q2 was largely on automotive sales. Personal electronics declined vs. last year, led by a dip in mobile phones.Component orders for the iPhone 7 are down 15%-20% vs. the iPhone 6S ramp in the second half of 2016, Vinh wrote. He kept his sector weight rating on Cirrus Logic which, he says, already reflects Wall Street speculation of boosted iPhone 7 dollar content.Cirrus Logic CEO Jason Rhode told analysts late Wednesday he doesn't expect ""outlandish unit growth in the mobile market,"" but he still sees a strong content-growth story.

423,SWKS,"The iPhone SE helped Apple (AAPL) edge Wall Street's June-quarter smartphone unit sales projections, but shares of iPhone chip suppliers Broadcom (AVGO), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) lazed Wednesday.Analysts continue to have modest expectations for the iPhone 7, set to launch Sept. 16.Late Tuesday, Apple said it sold 40.4 million iPhones in its fiscal Q3, topping analyst models for 40 million but still declining 15% vs. the year-earlier period. Apple's revenue fell 23% to $24.05 billion. The company saw broad demand for the less-costly and smaller SE model.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's 41-company Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry group, which includes leaders like ARM Holdings, Nvidia and Monolithic Power Systems, ranks No. 21 out of 197 groups tracked. But the other chip group, the 39-company Electronic Semiconductor-Manufacturing industry group, is moving up. It ranks No. 70 and has climbed from No. 163 over the past eight weeks.FBN analyst Shebly Seyrafi models 46 million iPhones shipments in fiscal Q4, which would be roughly flat year over year. Revenue, though, would decline 16% on demand for the iPhone SE, he predicts.Canaccord analyst Matt Ramsay expects iPhone sales to be down year over year for the next couple quarters. For the September quarter, he models 44.4 million iPhones sold, but with improving average sales prices.Apple's fiscal Q4 guidance implies 44 million units, which tops the consensus for 43 million, Ramsay wrote in a research report. Fewer units sold would be bad news for Apple's slew of chip suppliers. Some, however, have said increasing content in the iPhone 7 could offset slower sales. Apple shares jumped 6.5% to 102.95 Wednesday.Qorvo (QRVO) stock rocketed as much as 7% in early trading before settling back to a 4.4% gain at the close to 63.01 on the stock market today. Shares are about 22% extended from a 52.05 entry point achieved July 6 out of a cup-with-handle base. Investors are typically advised to take some profits at 20%.Texas Instruments (TXN) stock edged down marginally to 71.27, but Tuesday it hit a 16-year high on strong Q2 growth tied to sales of automotive chips. Shares are about 17% extended from a 60.09 entry point hit June 28 out of a flat base.Broadcom shares climbed 1.4% to 165.66 at the close, flirting with a 166.10 entry point out of a cup-with-handle base. Earlier, shares rose as much as 3%. Qualcomm stock also was up a fraction. It reported consensus-topping fiscal Q3 sales last week.Skyworks stock jumped as much as 4% early Wednesday, but settled for a 0.9% gain to 66.47. That led to a fractional dip in shares of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) to 87.44. NXP stock has been forming a cup base over the last eight weeks.

424,SWKS,"Apple (AAPL) is looking to bolster its iPhone profits by pressuring component suppliers for price discounts, says RBC Capital Markets.""We think Apple has been pushing for price discounts from multiple suppliers as a way to dampen foreign-exchange headwinds Apple is facing on their own P&L heading into the iPhone 7 ramps,"" RBC analyst Amit Daryanani said in a research report Tuesday.As a result, Apple could see upside to its gross profit margin, which it guided as flat for the September quarter, he said.Some Apple suppliers could see downside to their earnings, especially where multiple vendors supply the same component, he said.Single-source suppliers to Apple should be more resilient, Daryanani said. They include Broadcom (AVGO) and Analog Devices (ADI), he said.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom stock has a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99. It is the top-ranked stock in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. Broadcom is also on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks.A consistent trend from the June-quarter earnings season was Apple component suppliers guiding gross margins lower, Daryanani said.""Ten out of 11 suppliers that we tracked saw gross margins head lower for second-half 2016 vs. prior expectations (the only exception was TTM Technologies (TTMI)),"" he said.Daryanani rates Apple stock as outperform with a price target of 115. Apple stock rose 0.4% to 108.81 on the stock market today. Apple has risen for eight of the last 10 trading sessions, since reporting better-than-expected June quarter results and guiding Wall Street higher for the September quarter.Some chip companies get a majority of their revenue from Apple. And quite a few firms get 10% or more of their sales from supplying Apple. In his report, Daryanani spelled out which companies get the most business from Apple.Companies with the greatest exposure to Apple business include Dialog Semiconductor (75% of revenue), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) (66%), Foxconn (over 50%), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) (44%), Qorvo (QRVO) (32%), Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ASX) (31%) and InvenSense (INVN) (30%).Companies with less exposure to Apple, but which still get a significant share of sales from the Cupertino, Calif.-based company, include: Knowles (KN) (25%), Jabil Circuit (JBL) (24%), TTM (20%), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) (16%), Pegatron (15%-25%), Broadcom (15%-20%), Analog Devices (13%), Qualcomm (QCOM) (13%), Texas Instruments (TXN) (11%) and Amphenol (APH) (10%).Companies with small exposure to Apple business include Intel (INTC) (3%-5%), Flextronics (FLEX) (3%-4%) and Nvidia (NVDA) (3%-4%), Daryanani said.

425,SWKS,"Skyworks Solutions' (SWKS) inventory spiked to $100 million-plus in fiscal Q3, indicating key customer Apple (AAPL) will likely see a 25% year-over-year sales decline in September amid its iPhone 7 ramp, Pacific Crest analyst John Vinh said Friday.Skyworks stock plunged 8.6%, closing at 64.81 on the stock market today in heavy trading, despite late Thursday reporting fiscal Q3 sales and earnings that topped Wall Street's expectations and giving current-quarter guidance that largely met views. Apple ended 0.8% lower.IBD'S TAKE: Skyworks has an IBD Composite Rating of 57, meaning it outperforms nearly half of all stocks in terms of key metrics such as earnings power. Check out Skyworks' Stock Checkup here.For fiscal Q3, Skyworks reported $751.7 million in sales and $1.24 earnings per share ex items, both up 7% vs. last year and topping analysts' model for $750.2 million and $1.21, respectively. Fiscal Q4 guidance for $831 million and $1.43 meant each metric would decline 6%, but it was in line with expectations.Skyworks CFO Don Palette, speaking on the late Thursday conference call with analysts, explained the high inventory as a result of ""some ramps"" at OEMs and ""a new hub arrangement for a large customer in Asia."" But inventory is likely to come down in fiscal Q4, he said.The hub transition should only account for $8 million to $10 million in inventory, MKM analyst Ian Ing wrote in a research report. But he scoffed at shareholders' apparent concern that Skyworks had lost share at a major OEM, as suggested by heightened inventory.""Investors may retain some skepticism that elevated inventory or sluggish incremental gross margins are not warning signs of socket loss or price concessions,"" he wrote. ""We think this is noise.""China was also a key segment for Skyworks in fiscal Q3. It contributed 25% of total sales and grew 10% sequentially, CEO Liam Griffin said on the call. Ing estimates Skyworks has $9 of content in Huawei flagship products. Skyworks also gained 15% of content at Samsung compared with a year ago, Griffin said.He reiterated his buy rating and 93 price target on Skyworks stock. Incremental contribution margins on new revenue should return to a typical 58%-60% in the second half of 2017, when Apple is expected to launch its iPhone 8 with an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screen.The iPhone 8 will be Skyworks' next major catalyst, Pacific Crest's Vinh wrote in a research report. He maintained his sector weight rating on Skyworks stock. Although Skyworks is hopeful its Internet of Things sales will boom, Vinh sees smart M&A as Skyworks' path to success.""We believe transformational M&A will increasingly become a more important option for the company moving forward,"" he wrote.He said acquisition targets for Skyworks could include Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) and Silicon Laboratories (SLAB).

428,SWKS,"Apple (AAPL) supplier Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) is expected late Thursday to report a sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year declines in earnings. In its fiscal third-quarter report, Skyworks also is forecast to post sales that recovered minimally from the company's slowest-ever growth period.For fiscal Q3, the consensus of 24 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters models $750.2 million in sales, down 7% on a year-over-year basis vs. 2% growth in the prior quarter. But $1.21 earnings per share ex items would fall 10%.Skyworks' sales and EPS have both decelerated for five consecutive quarters. Like Apple's other chip suppliers, Skyworks was tugged down in April on Apple's first quarterly sales drop since 2003 and first-ever iPhone sales dip.Unlike fellow Apple supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) -- set to report its fiscal Q3 on Wednesday — analysts don't expect a Q4 recovery for Skyworks. Wall Street's model calls for a 6% decline in sales and a 7% decline in EPS in fiscal Q4.Skyworks rivals Broadcom (AVGO) and Qorvo (QRVO) in supplying radio-frequency chips for Apple's iPhones. But Broadcom recently gapped up with the $37 billion merger with the former Avago, and Qorvo is leading Skyworks in the carrier-aggregation battle, Citigroup recently said.IBD's TAKE: Skyworks stock has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 54, meaning it underperforms nearly half of its rivals. But rival Broadcom boasts a top-ranking CR of 99 and its Electronics Semiconductor-Fabless industry group is No. 23 out of 197 groups tracked. Take a look at Broadcom's stock checkup.Both are more diversified than Skyworks, Citigroup says. About 80% of Skyworks' total revenue is tied to smartphone sales. On a global basis, smartphones are experiencing a decline as Apple struggles to beat its own records and China nears saturation.Year-to-date, Skyworks stock is down 15% vs. IBD's 38-company Electronic Semiconductor-Manufacturing industry group, which is up 2% for the year.

502,SWKS,"RELATED: Tech Stocks Rally Reverses After Apple AnnouncementWho wins or loses from Apple's (AAPL) slew of product announcements this week about the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, an iPad Pro and voice-enabled Apple TV?With longer-term implications for media stocks, the Apple TV update ""renews concerns of a skinny network bundled offering,"" Cowen & Co. analyst Timothy Arcuri wrote in a Thursday research note, while mobile carriers could benefit modestly from Apple's get-every-new-iPhone upgrade plan.Apple's moves pose some competition to Google (GOOGL), too.Apple chips on menuMore immediately, what about Apple suppliers — the makers of chips and other technology inside all those shiny, new products?Chip stocks ARM Holdings (ARMH), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) all closed up about 2% in the stock market today. Avago Technologies and Broadcom each lifted about 1%, on an up day for stocks broadly, but with the market's status an uptrend under pressure.Skyworks' power amplifier components went into the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus platform. Qualcomm made several components for those phones. And in other news Thursday, Qualcomm released a drone platform called the Qualcomm Snapdragon Flight.Among chipmakers, Wednesday's Apple announcement is ""positive for ADI (ADI) (with 3D Touch on the iPhones); RF companies (Avago Technologies (AVGO)/SWKS) and Broadcom (BRCM), given higher average selling price/content due to MIMO (multiantenna) Wi-Fi; QCOM, given (advanced communication standard) LTE-A, while A9 (Apple processor) performance suggests (Qualcomm's) Snapdragon 820 will be on par or better than Exynos (a system-on-a-chip technology),"" Arcuri wrote.Moore's Law laid downArcuri sees the announcements as mixed to slightly negative for chip giant Intel (INTC) as the iPad Pro ""pushes a custom ARM processor further into compute (a potentially slippery slope) and ups the ante for INTC to get back on Moore's Law cadence."" Moore's Law, from Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, is roughly the idea that with technology enhancements, computing processor power doubles every couple of years.With the stock market turning Wednesday to an uptrend under pressure and flashing caution signals, several chip stocks pulled back. But with broader indexes rising moderately Thursday, some regained a little ground.Apple suppliers highly rated by IBD include Avago, with a Composite Rating of 94 out of a possible 99. Those with a CRs in the 80s include Skyworks and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). ARM has a 76, ADI a 75 and Qualcomm a low 36. Several are trading under their key 50-day lines, so they are not ripe for a buy.Apple stock closed up 2.2% Thursday after falling almost 2% Wednesday.Follow Donna Howell on Twitter @IBD_DHowell.RELATED: Tech Stocks Rally Reverses After Apple Announcement

551,SWKS,"Japan's SoftBank (SFTBY) will buy ARM Holdings (ARMH), a U.K. maker of wireless chip designs used by Apple (AAPL) and Samsung smartphones, for more than $32 billion, the companies confirmed early Monday.SoftBank agreed to pay 24.3 billion pounds ($32.1 billion) cash for ARM Holdings. ARM had a market capitalization of $22 billion before the deal. ARM's U.S. shares shot up nearly 41% to 66.17 on the stock market today. SoftBank fell 7.8% to 26.22.ARM Holdings dominates the market for wireless microprocessors for the Apple iPhone and other mobile devices. With smartphone sales stagnating and Apple iPhone sales falling, ARM earnings growth has slowed. But it's a player in the booming market for chip designs for the Internet of Things.SoftBank pledged to maintain ARM's current management, to double its U.K. workforce and to expand its overseas headcount over the next five years.SoftBank benefits from a stronger yen and cheaper pound in this deal. Since the U.K. voted to leave the European Union, the pound is down 12% vs. the Japanese yen. That makes it far cheaper for Softbank to buy ARM, but SoftBank said currency swings weren't a factor in the deal.SoftBank also owns 85% of U.S. telecom Sprint (S). Sprint fell 5% as investors see a shift in resources to buying ARM that could have gone to the wireless operator.SoftBank recently agreed to sell its 72% stake in Supercell, creator of mobile game ""Clash of Clans,"" for $7.8 billion to China's Tencent Holdings (TCEHY).IBD's TAKE: ARM Holdings is just one of many Apple chip suppliers. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) reports on Thursday, but SWKS earnings are expected to fall for a sixth straight quarter. Skyworks stock has been in a downturn since June 2015, but it has recently retaken its declining 50-day line. Meanwhile, Qualcomm (QCOM) is expected to report a fifth straight EPS decline.

Facebook fell 1.1% to 120.61 on Thursday, undercutting a 121.18 buy point. Facebook cleared that entry area to a new high on Wednesday, though on light volume.Goldman Sachs lowered Starbucks' price target to 69 from 73, but said the coffee giant still has ""comp levers to pull"" and that changes in the loyalty program likely caused the drop in digital business.Late Thursday, Starbucks said the 4% growth in U.S. same-store sales in Q3 was an ""anomaly"" citing weaker consumer confidence, geopolitical uncertainty and civil unrest.In Q3, adjusted earnings grew 17% to 49 cents a share, matching views, while sales fell short of estimates with 7% growth to $5.24 billion. Analysts had expected $5.33 billion.Starbucks now sees full-year consolidated revenue growth of 10%, down from prior guidance for ""10%+"" growth.Shares fell sharply in the premarket but closed up 0.5%.Cowen raised Qorvo's (QRVO) price target to 65 from 55 but lowered Skyworks' (SWKS) price target to 72 from 76.Late Thursday, Skyworks, a supplier for Apple, reported fiscal Q3 sales and earnings that fell year-over-year but still beat analyst expectations.Fellow Apple iPhone chipmaker Qorvo rose 0.8% to 60.56. Skyworks shares plunged 8.6% to 64.81. Apple, which reports its earnings next week, fell 0.8%.Southwest Airlines' (LUV) price target was cut to 47 from 49 at Cowen. On Thursday, the budget airline missed Q2 analyst expectations and said it sees Q3 unit revenue falling 3%-4%, worse than the 1.3% drop Cowen analysts expected.The airline is working to normalize travel on Friday after a computer issue caused hundreds of canceled flights and thousands of delays earlier in the week.Southwest shares rose 1.4% to 37.83 after diving 11.2% on Thursday.Chipotle's (CMG) price target was cut to 400 from 420 at Telsey Advisory Group.

The stock dipped 0.6% to 32.59 on Thursday after hitting an 8-year high of 33 on Wednesday.Starbucks met EPS views late Thursday but sales fell short. U.S. same-store sales rose just 4%, which Starbucks execs insisted was an anomaly. The coffee giant predicts a return to 5%-plus U.S. comps growth, but Starbucks did cut full-year sales targets.Starbucks shares fell nearly 3% in premarket action.IBD'S TAKE: Starbucks is a household name, but it's not a top-shelf stock right now. It's ranked 18th in the IBD Retail-Restaurant group. Meanwhile, Domino's Pizza broke out of a base to a new high on strong earnings Thursday. For Domino's key fundamental and technical ingredients -- and how it compares to top restaurant stocks, go to IBD Stock Checkup.Chipotle earnings and sales fell even more than expected, with same-store sales plunging 23.6%. Chipotle said a new rewards program and chorizo sausage are helping to boost traffic, but there's a long way to go before the one-time standout is back on its feet.Chipotle shares sank about 2% before the open.Skyworks, which makes chips for the Apple iPhone, reported fiscal Q3 earnings and sales that topped views, but still fell vs. a year earlier as iPhone sales slump. Skyworks fell 4% in premarket action. Apple, which reports its quarterly results next week, edged lower.PayPal fell about 3% in the premarket after rising late Thursday following its Q2 report.

Several other highly rated big names are close to entry points. Oil prices retreated to below $45 a barrel.Internet television network Netflix attracted just 1.68 million new customers in the second quarter vs. its target for 2.5 million. For Q3, Netflix expects to add 2.3 million new subscribers, vs. analyst estimates for 3.7 million. Netflix blamed the slowing subscriber growth on increased churn related to price increases for longtime subscribers. It also said the Summer Olympics will put the brakes on new subscriber gains in August. Netflix topped profit views, but shares sank nearly 13% for the week.Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk unveiled his ambitious, long-term plans for the electric car company in combination with SolarCity (SCTY), which Tesla aims to acquire in a $2.8 billion offer.

But weaker-than-expected Americas comps were an ""anomaly,"" said CEO Howard Schultz. Starbucks rallied Friday to hit three-month highs. Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) turned in mixed results. Shares fell Thursday but rose 2.3% for the week.EBay (EBAY) gapped out of a base, spiking 16% for the week to a record high after reporting Q2 EPS growth of 2% to 43 cents, beating views by a penny. Revenue rose 6% to $2.2 billion, also topping. Top- and bottom-line guidance for Q3 was light, but eBay's full-year projections were strong.

Intel's $13.5 billion and 59 cents earnings per share ex items for Q2 edged and topped the consensus, respectively. But Intel shares fell from an 18-month high on weaker-than-expected data center sales, though they closed the week down just 1.2%. Qualcomm reported $6 billion in sales and $1.16 EPS ex items for fiscal Q3, beating Wall Street expectations for a respective $5.58 billion and 97 cents. Qualcomm shares rose nearly 12% to a nine-month high.

Shares rose on the news though, as investors had priced in skepticism that the deals would win approval. Meanwhile, Humana raised its EPS guidance and said it will exit many ObamaCare exchange markets next year. UnitedHealth (UNH), the largest managed care firm, topped EPS views and said 2017 profit will improve from exiting nearly all exchanges.United Airlines (UAL) beat Q2 estimates and cut full-year carrying capacity growth, as international uncertainties weighed. The carrier also said it would reduce winter flights to the U.K. Delta Air Lines (DAL) said in the prior week that it would do the same following the nation's Brexit vote. Southwest (LUV) forecast a Q3 unit revenue decline, which would be its first this year. The carrier also missed Q2 estimates, and, like Spirit Airlines (SAVE), indicated that heavy lower-fare competition persists -- good for customers, but bad for airlines' financial results. American Airlines (AAL) reported a Q2 profit drop that wasn't as bad as expected. American also said the Brexit may help, not hurt, global carriers.The Q2 season kicked off with three solid reports from big-cap drugmakers. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) beat estimates and raised guidance, driven by the strength of its pharma division. Novartis (NVS) also beat Q2 estimates, but its stock fell as it warned of rising expenses related to new drug launches, and also said the FDA had rejected its biosimilar version of Amgen (AMGN) drug Neulasta.

GE and Honeywell shares fell Friday after hitting long-term highs earlier in the week.Lockheed Martin (LMT) raised its full-year outlook after reporting Q2 results above analyst estimates, but management warned it can't sustain its current level of F-35 spending unless the defense giant gets another production contract from the Pentagon soon. The attempted coup in Turkey isn't expected to weigh on the fighter's sales or production. Textron (TXT), maker of Cessna planes and Bell helicopters, reported a 10% jump in EPS, beating analyst expectations and revenue that climbed 8.1%, also above Wall Street views. It sees full-year EPS of $2.60 to $2.80. The midpoint is under analyst estimates for $2.72.Lockheed stock hit a record high during the week, closing the week up 0.1%. Textron rose 2.8%.

556,SWKS,"Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS) shares nosedived Tuesday after Pacific Crest analyst Michael McConnell downgraded the stocks and predicted a 15%-20% decline in Apple (AAPL) iPhone 7 shipments later this year compared with shipments of the iPhone 6S after that product was released last September.Cirrus Logic stock closed down 6% at 35.76 on the stock market today, and Skyworks Solutions also fell 6%, closing at 58.82. Broadcom (AVGO), Analog Devices (ADI) and Qualcomm (QCOM) stocks followed, down a respective 2.2%, 2.3% and 2%.McConnell downgraded Cirrus Logic and Skyworks stocks to sector weight. He cut his price target on Broadcom to 180 from 185, on Analog Devices to 60 from 62, and on Qualcomm to 59 from 61.Cirrus Logic will benefit from Apple's transition to digital headsets, and Skyworks is likely to gain 10%-15% radio frequency content in the iPhone 7, but ""we ultimately don't believe this will be enough to offset a 15%-20% decline in iPhone 7 shipments,"" McConnell wrote in a research note, comparing it with the iPhone 6S.He has a 40 price target on Cirrus Logic stock and a 90 price target on Skyworks stock.Slowing iPhone sales will similarly slug InvenSense (INVN), Qorvo (QRVO), Synaptics (SYNA) and Texas Instruments (TXN), McConnell wrote, also cutting his estimates on these companies. Qualcomm will continue to struggle to re-sign Chinese licensees under new agreements, he said.But No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC), which will reportedly supply a third of the Apple iPhone 7 modems, got a price target boost to 37 from 35 on better-than-seasonal notebook forecasts for Q3, up 7%-10% sequentially vs. typical 6% growth, he said.Graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) garnered higher estimates on its July GeForce 1060 launch date to compete with rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Coupled with strong demand and higher average sales prices, Nvidia is likely to exceed its Q2 guidance, McConnell wrote.

557,SWKS,"Apple (AAPL) chip suppliers Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) saw their stocks downgraded on iPhone sales concerns on Tuesday, as internet television network Netflix (NFLX) received a downgrade on growth risks.On the upside, autonomous driving technology firm Mobileye (MBLY) and online security software maker CyberArk Software (CYBR) received bullish reports ahead of the opening bell Tuesday.Pacific Crest Securities on Monday lowered its sales and earnings estimates for a host of Apple component suppliers on weaker-than-expected iPhone 7 supply chain forecasts. The investment bank downgraded Cirrus Logic and Skyworks Solutions to sector weight from overweight. It set a fair value range on Cirrus Logic of 33 to 36 and on Skyworks of 60 to 67.Cirrus Logic ended the regular session Friday at 38.04 but finished 6% lower Tuesday. Skyworks also lost 6%.Pacific Crest maintained its overweight rating on Analog Devices (ADI), but lowered its price target to 60 from 62. It took similar action on shares of Broadcom (AVGO) and Qualcomm (QCOM). It reiterated overweight ratings on Broadcom and Qualcomm, but cut their price targets. Broadcom was lowered to 180 from 185 and Qualcomm to 59 from 61.Analog Devices closed Friday at 56.63 and closed down 2.2% Tuesday. Broadcom ended last week at 154.22 and fell 2.2% Tuesday. Qualcomm closed before the holiday weekend at 53 and eased 2% Tuesday.""Our lowered estimates reflect a much more disappointing second-half 2016 iPhone 7 ramp than what we had previously expected, as feedback from Asia indicates units are expected to be down 15% to 20% as compared to the iPhone 6S, as Apple appears to be taking a much more cautious view of the ramp,"" Pacific Crest analysts said in a report.IBD's Take: While analyst comments can move stocks in the short term, investors should base their decisions on objective criteria and sound buy and sell rules. For access to IBD's proprietary data and chart tools, take a trial of IBD's Marketsmith.Needham analyst Laura Martin on Tuesday downgraded Netflix stock to hold from buy on concerns that Brexit adds to risks of decelerating growth for Netflix in the U.K. and European Union over the next 12 to 24 months. She also predicted higher subscriber churn in the region.Meanwhile, Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris on Tuesday reiterated his buy rating on Netflix and added the stock to the firm's ""Best Ideas List.""

"
559,SWKS,"SoftBank's (SFTBY) announcement late Sunday of its $32 billion deal to acquire Apple (AAPL) iPhone component supplier ARM Holdings (ARMH) could stoke further M&A activity, with top-five chipmakers -- Intel (INTC), Texas Instruments (TXN), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Broadcom (AVGO) -- cited as potential acquirers.Any company with a $10 billion to $15 billion market capitalization is on the table, says S&P Global Market Intelligence analyst Angelo Zino. Companies valued around $5 billion are in the ""sweet spot."" Recent rumors have targeted Xilinx (XLNX), which is valued above $12 billion.Marvell Technology (MRVL), Cavium (CAVM), Cypress Semiconductor (CY), Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) and Integrated Device Technology (IDTI) also fit the bill for possible acquisitions, Zino told IBD.Of IBD's 41-company Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry group, five names top $15 billion in market valuation: Qualcomm, Broadcom, ARM, Nvidia (NVDA) and NXP.At the close on the stock market today, ARM stock catapulted 40.6% to 66.17 and at an all-time high. That helped pull the IBD Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry group up 2%, hitting a 13-month high. Meanwhile, Apple gained 1.1% to 99.88. Qualcomm, which reports earnings later this week, also added 1.1%, and ended the day at 55.35. Broadcom advanced 0.7% to 162.33. Intel, which has struggled to enter the low-power microprocessor market dominated by ARM, ticked down 2 cents to 35.05.IBD'S TAKE: The Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry ranks No. 24 out of 197 groups tracked and includes leaders like Nvidia, the group's No. 1-ranked Monolithic Power Systems, Silicon Motion Technology, Broadcom and MaxLinear. All five have Composite Ratings of 99, meaning they perform in the top 1% of all stocks in key metrics such as earnings and sales growth.""Intel and Qualcomm are sitting on a hoard of cash, and both have concerns with regards to growth,"" Zino said. ""Broadcom, formerly Avago, has done a phenomenal job with acquisitions over the last three years. They're at a point now where they're looking to increase their war chest over the next 12 to 18 months.""Canaccord analyst Matt Ramsay puts Silicon Laboratories (SLAB), Cavium and GoPro (GPRO) supplier Ambarella (AMBA) on his potential takeover list, but says he doesn't see ARM as a target. U.K.-based ARM treats its licensees with a very ""vendor neutral approach"" and wasn't bandied on the typical rumor mill.""After last night's news, I wouldn't put anything (in M&A) past anybody,"" Ramsay told IBD. ""I don't think anything is off the table. Bigger companies buying differentiated tech is not off the table.""What's newer is companies doing more financial-engineering-type mergers, where it's a merger of equals to protect earnings growth and cash flow growth.""But 2016 M&A won't resemble the frenzy of 2015 chip-sector deals, when the value of M&As rocketed above $115 billion. In 2015, companies were buying innovation. Such was the case when Intel spent $16.7 billion to acquire field-programmable gate array (FPGA) maker Altera. This year, companies will be buying earnings leverage.""The semiconductor space has seen a dramatic slowdown in growth, and there's going to be a move by larger players to generate growth and earnings leverage via acquisitions,"" Ramsay said. ""You've got fairly healthy balance sheets across the sector here, and because of that, you're going to see more M&A.""Zino added: ""But in terms of dollar amount, you're not going to see what you saw in 2015 again.""Smartphone growth slowed to 10% in 2015 from 29% in 2014, Zino said. That's tugged at the bottom line for Apple iPhone suppliers like Qualcomm and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), which analysts expect to report a respective fifth and sixth quarter of decline later this week.This year, Zino expects smartphones to decelerate to 5%-6% growth. Canaccord's Ramsay is less bullish -- he views flat growth for 2016. For 2017, though, Apple's iPhone 8 ""super cycle"" could lend itself to 5% growth, Ramsay told IBD. And niche sectors like video, gaming and automotive will continue to growth.On the latter point, the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January used to be all about smartphones, but automotive and self-driving efforts by Apple, Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla Motors (TSLA) have pressed chipmakers into a new role, Ramsay says, noting, ""Now, there's a car in every booth.""

606,SWKS,"Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) stock was up nearly 1% Thursday afternoon, after the Apple (AAPL) chip supplier announced it will expand operations in Osaka, Japan.Skyworks teamed up with Osaka-based Panasonic in April 2014 to design and develop high-performance filters for use in mobile devices and the emerging Internet Of Things markets.Skyworks expects its expansion — a two-story, 405,000-square-foot facility — to be complete by September, according to its press release.Those operations will be critical to addressing the increasingly challenging task of keeping up with consumer demand for constant connectivity, CEO David Aldrich said in the release.""Given the increasing importance of filters to our target markets and customers, we are expanding our internal capability to meet current and future demand in a world-class environment,"" he said.Skyworks stock has risen 115% to above 90 since its April 2014 team-up with Panasonic. The stock broke out in May, setting a record high at 112.88 in June before hitting a snag that sent it back below its 200-day moving average a month later.In early afternoon trading on the stock market today, Skyworks stock was trading near 90.50.In its IBD Electric-Semiconductor Manufacturers group, Skyworks boasts a leading 98 Composite Rating.

607,SWKS,"Analysts downgraded Apple (AAPL) iPhone suppliers Skyworks (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO), while also weighing in on the outlook for Netflix (NFLX) and SolarCity's (SCTY) proposed merger with Tesla (TSLA).Mizuho downgraded Skyworks to a neutral from buy, slashing its price target on the wireless chipmaker to 68 from 99. The research firm stressed the need for Skyworks to diversify its revenue stream as its core smartphone market, which accounts for 75% of sales, slows.Mizuho also downgraded Qorvo to neutral from buy, putting a 55 target on the wireless and broadband chipmaker, in line with its closing price on Thursday.Skyworks shares fell 1.1% to 62.60 in the stock market today. Qorvo lost 1.4% to 54.50. Apple shares rose 0.3% to 95.89, but found resistance at the 50-day line.Canaccord started coverage on Netflix with a buy rating and 120 target. Earlier this week, Nielsen disclosed viewership data for streaming shows on Netflix, Hulu and other platforms.The premier episode of ""Orange is the New Black,"" which is produced by Netflix and streams on the site, was seen by 6.7 million in the U.S., comparable to HBO's hit ""Game of Thrones.""Netflix shares were up 5.7% Friday.Credit Suisse said that it thinks Tesla's proposed merger substantially undervalues SolarCity. Still, the research firm sees 60% to 70% odds that the deal closes with little or no change in the terms. It cut its rating on SolarCity to neutral from outperform, lowering the target to 27 from 38.Shares were down 0.7%.Evercore ISI downgraded Qualcomm (QCOM) to hold from buy. That followed Qualcomm's downgrade by Bernstein on Thursday, which sees Wall Street expectations for licensing revenue as too aggressive.Qualcomm was off 1.1% to 53.Meanwhile, RBC Capital Markets pared its price target on Texas Instruments (TXN) to 66 from 68 while keeping an outperform rating. Texas Instruments fell 0.9% to 62.11.Barclays downgraded temporary staffing firm Manpower's (MAN) to equal weight from overweight, slicing the price target to 65 from 85. Analysts cited the company's 64% exposure to Europe in the wake of Brexit. Manpower skidded 2.2% to 62.95.

608,SWKS,"No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) reportedly swiped a third of Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7 modems from Qualcomm (QCOM), benefiting Qorvo (QRVO) to the potential detriment of Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), but the U.K.'s decision to exit the European Union will slug all of them, Mizuho says.On Friday, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh downgraded Skyworks and Qorvo stocks to neutral, matching his neutral rating on Qualcomm stock. He estimates that all three are 75% tied to the smartphone market, unlike radio-frequency chip competitor Broadcom (AVGO), which is 22% exposed.Also, RBC Capital analyst Amit Daryanani cut his price targets and estimates for chipmakers Analog Devices (ADI) and Texas Instruments (TXN), noting the likelihood of stalled IT spending, and industrial and automotive demand in the wake of Brexit.On the stock market today, Qorvo stock fell 1.4% and Qualcomm 1.1%. Broadcom, Skyworks and Texas Instruments were down 0.8%, 1.1% and 0.9%, respectively, while Analog Devices dipped 1 cent to 56.63 and Intel 0.15% to 32.75. Apple rose 0.3%.""While the iPhone 7 is ramping and our checks indicate (China smartphone maker) Huawei is comfortable with its 2016 outlook, the demand uncertainty combined with a seasonally weaker Samsung/China handset market makes for a challenging second half of the year,"" Rakesh wrote.That will impact Qorvo, Qualcomm and Skyworks to a greater degree than Broadcom, he wrote. Since merging with the former Avago, Broadcom has reduced its smartphone exposure, which had accounted for half of its revenue. That lower exposure will be key amid slowing smartphone sales.Rakesh suggested Skyworks tackle M&A again after its failed attempt to buy PMC-Sierra. He cut his price target on Skyworks stock to 68 from 99, but he said the company, a key Huawei supplier, could see strength as that company ramps its newest flagship.Meanwhile, he says, Intel's likelihood of taking 30% of the iPhone 7 mix will boost Qorvo ""given its legacy relationship"" in making chips compatible with Intel chips. And Qorvo will enjoy gains on better-than-expected strength in the Samsung Galaxy S7. Rakesh kept his 55 price target on Qorvo stock.RBC's Daryanani, in his separate report, said Apple likely accounts for 10% of revenue for Texas Instruments and Analog Devices. He cut his price target on Texas Instruments to 66 from 68, and cut his PT on Analog Devices to 63 from 65, to reflect Brexit's impact. But he kept an outperform rating on both stocks.""This could offset some softness in other markets,"" he wrote. ""While it is early to access any sizable impact from Brexit, we think it is prudent to adjust expectations for Europe.""Gartner estimates that global enterprise IT spending will rise 1.2% in 2016 vs. its earlier views for 1.6% growth, Daryanani pointed out, but in the U.K., IT spending will decline 1.5% vs. prior expectations for 1.7% growth. Europe's spending is expected to dive ""modestly.""In automotive chips, RBC sees North American production as flat and European production declining 1.4% in 2017 vs. earlier projections for 2% and 2.9% growth, Daryanani wrote.Texas Instruments' automotive sales have grown at an 11% four-year compound annual growth rate, while Analog Devices has had a 14% five-year CAGR. For both, investors should now expect single-digit growth, Daryanani wrote.

610,SWKS,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) crushed analysts' Q2 expectations and Q3 outlook early Thursday, guiding to more than $1 billion year-over-year growth amid Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7 ramp, with the smartphone expected to be released in September.CFO Lora Ho credited Taiwan Semiconductor's Q2 performance to increases in mid- and low-end smartphone segments, and hinted at Apple's upcoming iPhone 7 release. TSM is widely rumored to be the sole producer of Apple's upcoming A10 processor.""We expect our business in the third quarter will benefit from new product launches by major mobile device customers, as well as continued inventory restocking by our customers,"" Ho said in a statement.TSM's U.S. stock rose 0.8% to 27.11 on the stock market today, in a buy zone from a 26.68 entry point out of a cup-with-handle base. Shares are up 19% this year, and the stock has a good-but-not-great IBD Relative Price Strength Rating of 80, putting it among the top 20% of all stocks in performance over the past 12 months.Shares of fellow Apple suppliers Qorvo (QRVO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Broadcom (AVGO) lifted Thursday, up nearly 4%, more than 3% and about 2%, respectively. Qualcomm (QCOM), another Apple chip supplier, is set to report earnings next Wednesday, and Skyworks' result are due next Thursday, July 21. No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) also is slated to report its Q2 earnings on Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: Taiwan Semiconductor isn't the only chipmaker to rebound on its supposed tie to Apple's iPhone. Intel and Cirrus Logic have become the subjects of recent speculation. Intel is now 6% extended from a flat-base entry point at 37.85. Cirrus Logic is 3% extended from a cup-with-handle base and 38.24 entry point.For Q2, TSM reported $6.84 billion in sales and 43 cents earnings per American Depositary Receipt ex items, topping the consensus of analysts polled by FactSet for $6.79 billion and 41 cents. Three months ago, TSM guided revenue to about $6.65 billion to $6.75 billion.On a year-over-year basis, sales rose 3% and EPS dipped 9%. Excluding non-recurring gains in the year-earlier period, Taiwan Semiconductor's EPS would have grown by 17%, the company said.Current-quarter sales guidance for 254 billion to 257 billion Taiwan dollars (about $7.86 billion to $7.95 billion) would be up 18% from $6.67 billion in the year-earlier quarter at the midpoint. That would be TSM's biggest gain in six quarters. Analysts had modeled $7.75 billion.TSM doesn't provide EPS guidance, but analysts polled by FactSet see 55 cents, up 20% from Q3 2015.

612,SWKS,"Analog Devices (ADI) racked up $500 million in Force Touch sales, implying a tenfold return on its Apple (AAPL) iPhone 6S investment, Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer said Friday, estimating that the chipmaker will gain 30% content in the iPhone 7.But the Brexit vote Friday prompted stocks to broadly topple, leading Analog Devices stock to plunge 5.3% to 55.04 in the stock market today. It was far from alone. Fellow Apple chipmakers NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Broadcom (AVGO) fell, respectively, 8.3%, 8.3%, 7.8% and 6.2%. IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing group dropped 5.9%.Pitzer retained his outperform rating and 72 price target on Analog Devices stock. And while its Apple-related sales gets all the headlines, Pitzer says that Analog Devices' best growth will stem from its core infrastructure, automotive and industrial segments.Since 2012 when competitive pressure from Bosch and STMicroelectronics (STM) prompted it to exit parts of the passive-safety market, Analog Devices' automotive sales have grown at a 4% compound annual growth rate vs. peers at a 12% CAGR, Pitzer says. But other automotive areas have been a boon for Analog Devices. Its sales of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) have grown at a 44% CAGR, powertrain at a 9% CAGR and infotainment at an 8% CAGR over three years.Pitzer sees Analog Devices' Apple sales being under-modeled. Apple, which is notorious for swapping components, would be hard-pressed to displace Analog Devices as the Force Touch supplier, he said.He estimates that Analog Devices spent $10 million to $15 million developing Force Touch which, in turn, pulled in $500 million in accumulated sales. That tenfold return on investment compares to the typical seven times ROI, Pitzer wrote in a research note Friday. And unlike other chips, Force Touch is not a commodity, he says.Analog Devices' Apple sales grew from nil in Q1 2015 to $250 million in Q4 2014, representing 25% of total sales, he says. Pitzer expects Analog Devices to add three new applications for a total of five in the iPhone 7.Analog Devices could grow its Apple content by 30%, he said.

613,SWKS,"Technology giants in the S&P 500 are expected to turn in their worst earnings drop since the recession, dragged down by falling sales of the Apple (AAPL) iPhone.Overall, S&P 500 earnings in the second quarter will fall 4.7% vs. a year earlier, the fourth straight quarterly decline, according to analyst estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters. Revenues are expected to dip 0.9%, the sixth straight quarterly slide.Technology earnings are expected to decline 6% from a year earlier, worse than the 4% fall in Q1, according to Thomson Reuters. Tech revenue should slide 4.8%. But excluding Apple, tech profits should dip just 1%, with revenue off 2.5%.Apple's earnings per share are seen falling 24.9%, as revenue tumbles $7.6 billion from a year earlier to $42 billion. Apple revenue fell 13% in the prior quarter, the first drop in more than decade.Apple's revenue drop will more than offset a combined $5 billion pop from Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB). Google parent Alphabet is expected to report a 15.2% rise in earnings as revenue grows by $3 billion, or 17.0%, to $20.7 billion. Facebook's earnings are forecast to expand 62%, as revenue surges by just under $2 billion, or 48.5%.Despite Apple's ongoing slump, the stock has recently shown flickers of life, moving back above its 50-day moving average. But it's still in a yearlong downtrend.Facebook rose 1.2% on Friday, retaking a 117.09 entry point, but in below-average trade. Alphabet is close to retaking its 50-day but is much nearer its highs than Apple is.IBD'S TAKE: Facebook was just one of many notable breakouts Friday, with General Electric and Lowe's among those clearing entry points. Microsoft (MSFT) and Intel (INTC) are expected to see earnings declines of 3.3% and 3.6%, respectively. Weaker iPhone sales won't just hit Apple, but its suppliers too: Skyworks (SWKS) is seen reporting a 9.7% drop in earnings, as revenue falls 7.4% to $750 million.S&P 500 energy earnings are expected to tumble 78.5%, though that's better than Q1's outright loss.The energy sector is ""the main drag,"" but not the only one, Thomson Reuters analyst Greg Harrison told IBD. Six of 10 S&P 500 sectors tracked by the data provider are expected to show negative earnings growth.S&P 500 earnings excluding energy are on tap to fall 0.8%, the first drop in several years, after a scant 0.4% Q1 rise. Revenue should climb 2.1%.Companies tend to beat profit views by a few percentage points overall, so non-energy earnings likely will show a gain.Overall earnings and revenue are expected to return to growth in the current third quarter, as energy companies face easier comparisons.Stock markets typically rally ahead of a profit recovery, as investors anticipate stronger results. The current bull market began in March 2009, months before corporate results bounced back. But sustained profit declines usually occur during a recession -- such as the 2007-2009 slump. Not this time. And while stocks have been choppy for months, they've generally moved sideways to slightly higher.Also, the earnings upturn for the S&P 500, packed with corporate titans with heavy overseas exposure, is looking somewhat less certain after the U.K.'s Brexit vote sent interest rates sliding and boosted the value of the dollar.S&P consumer staples earnings rose 1.5% in the first quarter, but they are expected to slip 1.7% in the second quarter. Wal-Mart (WMT) earnings will likely show a 5.6% earnings decline amid flat revenue. Wal-Mart is continuing to face margin pressures after boosting its base wage to $10 an hour in February.After falling for nearly all of 2015, Wal-Mart shares have gradually recovered, rising last week to their best levels since July 2015.Financials have been another laggard, with sector earnings expected to fall 5.4% after a 10.4% tumble in the first quarter. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is expected to see a 6.5% earnings drop as revenues dip 1.7%. Earnings for Wells Fargo (WFC) are seen off a more modest 3.3%. JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup (C) are due to report Q2 results in the coming week.Low interest rates have eroded the spread between the interest they can charge borrowers and what they have to pay depositors, and the further drop in borrowing costs since Brexit could mean more of the same in the current quarter.Shares of JPMorgan and other major banks remain far off their highs.Earnings in the consumer discretionary sector are expected to lead the way, rising 8.8% in the quarter. The sector includes Amazon (AMZN), which is projected to have another knockout quarter. The online retail giant and web-services provider is seen posting a 27.4% revenue boost. Amazon earnings should soar to $1.10 a share from 19 cents a year earlier.Amazon shares are at all-time highs after finding support at the 50-day line amid the post-Brexit vote sell-off.The other sectors expected to see positive earnings are health care (up 4.5%); industrials (3.1%) and utilities (1.6%). Health care demand tends to rise steadily, while domestic-focused utilities are shielded from overseas turmoil.Industrials like General Electric (GE) received something of a reprieve from the strong dollar in the second quarter, but that appears at risk of reversing in the third quarter after the U.K. vote to leave the European Union sent the dollar higher.Still, General Electric shares hit an eight-year high on Friday, closing at 32.20, just over a 32.15 buy point.Brexit isn't expected to have much of a direct impact on earnings in the near term, with the U.K. and Europe accounting for about 1% and 7% of S&P 500 revenue, respectively, Thomson Reuters' Harrison said.Yet, indirect effects from the stronger dollar and lower interest rates will be a factor. Earnings estimates for the third quarter have come down just ""a tad bit"" since Brexit, Sheraz Mian, director of research at Zacks Investment Research, told IBD.""We'll begin to learn the full extent (of the impact) in coming days and weeks as companies share their outlook on earnings calls,"" he added.

614,SWKS,"Stocks fell to session lows Tuesday afternoon as Brexit fears gripped the market again, sending shares of Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan (JPM) and Apple (AAPL) sharply lower.The Nasdaq slumped 1.3%, the S&P 500 shed 1% and the Dow Jones industrial average gave up 0.9%. Volume was mixed, tracking higher on the NYSE but lower on the Nasdaq vs. the same time Friday.Financial stocks resumed their post-Brexit slide. American Express (AXP), Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase were among the Dow's biggest decliners. American Express lost 2.7%, Goldman Sachs 3.2% and JPMorgan 3.4%.Also on the Dow, Apple gapped down and fell more than 1% after hitting resistance at its 50-day moving average on Friday. Shares have closed below the line since an April 26 gap down and are 28% off their 52-week high. Citi cut its forecast for the iPhone maker's fiscal Q3 and Q4 earnings, citing macro uncertainty stemming from Brexit, currency volatility and longer iPhone replacement cycles.Apple suppliers Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) took big hits after getting downgraded to sector weight from overweight by Pacific Crest Securities, due to weaker-than-expected iPhone 7 supply-chain forecasts.Shares of both stocks plunged about 7%. Pacific Crest also cut its price targets on Analog Devices (ADI), Broadcom (AVGO) and Qualcomm (QCOM).

634,SWKS,"Avago Technologies stock jumped late Wednesday after the Apple supplier reported fiscal Q4 earnings that topped Wall Street expectations, with full-year fiscal 2015 EPS jumping 83% from fiscal 2014.Wireless sales growth helped push fiscal 2015 revenue to a record, Avago (AVGO) CEO Hock Tan said during the company's earnings conference call with analysts.Shares were up 7.5% in after-hours trading, after the supplier of chips to Apple (AAPL) and other mobile device makers released its earnings. Shares of fellow Apple chip suppliers NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) were both up more than 1% after hours.Broadcom (BRCM) stock was up 4.5%. In May, Avago agreed to buy Broadcom for $37 billion, but Avago hasn't said when it expects that deal, the largest chip merger ever, to close.For its Q4, which ended Oct. 31, Avago reported $1.853 billion in non-GAAP sales and $2.51 earnings per share ex items, up 15% and 26%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter.Non-GAAP sales narrowly beat the $1.85 billion consensus estimate of 24 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, but EPS ex items easily topped analyst views of $2.38.For the fiscal year, Avago smashed records with $6.9 billion in non-GAAP sales, up 60% from fiscal 2014. EPS ex items jumped to $8.98, topping the $8.84 analyst estimate.Wireless sales accounted for 37% of Avago's Q4 sales and rose 10% sequentially during the seasonally strong quarter as ""our North American customer"" ramped its flagship smartphone, Tan told analysts. He was almost certainly speaking of Apple, but not by name.Enterprise storage sales accounted for 35% of Q4 sales, rising 9% from Q3, Tan said.Wireless Weakness To Hit Q1For fiscal Q1, ending Jan. 31, Avago guided to $1.768 billion in sales, plus or minus $25 million — the midpoint slightly short of Wall Street forecasts for $1.82 billion. That would be up 8% year over year at the midpoint but would mark the company's smallest gain since the July 2013 quarter.""Unlike last year, we do see a seasonal decline in Q1 demand and expect our wireless revenue to decline in the low teens,"" Tan said. ""Last year, Q1 (wireless) demand held out, offsetting seasonal declines. We don't see that phenomenon this year.""Avago's industrial sales, which fell 10% sequentially in Q4, will be down again sequentially in Q1 by low single digits, Tan said. Enterprise storage and wired infrastructure are expected to be up slightly, sequentially.Teardowns show Avago radio-frequency (RF) chips in Apple iPhones. Again without identifying his customer by name, Tan said that Avago ""had to walk away from supplying additional RF content"" in a new smartphone model ""because of constrained manufacturing. That will not happen again.""Many analysts predict a decline in Q1 unit sales for the iPhone, and other Apple suppliers have noted as much during their September-quarter conference calls.Tan, though, predicts a 20% increase in Avago RF content in the next smartphone from the unnamed North American customer — i.e., Apple. Analysts questioned that growth prediction.""Not many people can do it,"" Tan said. But ""content keeps going in that range, and we're always able to capture that. That is a broad trend in the smartphone market, and we do not see that changing in the next three years.""Avago stock fell a fraction in Wednesday's regular session but is up 31% for the year.

635,SWKS,"Apple (AAPL) supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) inked a deal Wednesday with Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi, resolving a piece of a continuing overseas royalty battle that dented the chipmaker's September-quarter sales and dampened December-quarter guidance.

"
637,SWKS,"Apple (AAPL) supplier Avago Technologies (AVGO) might jettison its unprofitable industrial segment in lieu of a renewed focus on smartphone chips, MKM analyst Ian Ing suggests.This comes as Avago and fellow Apple chip suppliers like Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Qorvo (QRVO), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS) face continued constraints from slowing growth in the iPhone market, Ing wrote.""Avago is increasingly exposed to the challenges of cyclicality at both Apple and broader semiconductors,"" Ing wrote in a recent research report.The industry is expecting a 10%-15% decline in March-quarter iPhone sales, and a Credit Suisse analyst suggested earlier this month that Apple had cut its November orders by 10%. Shares of Apple and its suppliers tumbled on that report.Ing sees Avago as having a slim chance of guiding Q1 above the consensus when it reports its fiscal Q4 earnings after the close Dec. 2. If its guidance falls short, that would reflect hampered iPhone sales and Avago's sale of its optical module manufacturing business to China-based tech manufacturer Foxconn Interconnect Technologies, Ing wrote.He maintained his buy rating on Avago stock but dropped his price target to 158 from 159.Record-Smashing Sales, EPSFor its Q4 ended Oct. 31, Avago is expected to report a record $1.85 billion in sales, up 15% vs. the year-earlier quarter, and $2.38 earnings per share ex items, up 20%.Three months ago, Avago guided to $1.84 billion in sales, plus or minus $25 million.For the year, the consensus of 24 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters sees Avago pulling in $6.9 billion in sales and $8.84 EPS minus items, up 60% and 80%, respectively, vs. 2014 figures.Ing looks for Avago to return to aggressive M&A after it completes the Broadcom deal. In May, Avago agreed to buy Broadcom for $37 billion — the largest pure-tech merger ever until Dell and EMC (EMC) last month announced their $67 billion combination.""Much of Avago's story continues to revolve around how fast it returns to large acquisitions as it de-levers post-Broadcom,"" Ing wrote.Rampant chip sector M&A action broke records in 2015 as expenses skyrocket and growth slows. Possibly to counteract rising costs and add new vertical markets, Avago, a fabless company, submitted a winning bid earlier this month for an idle Eugene, Ore., fabrication (chip manufacturing) plant, Ing wrote.""We see this as a sign that Avago plans to have the benefits of scale and low-cost, in-sourced manufacturing as the semiconductor industry matures,"" he wrote.Avago is in IBD's Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless Group, where it has the fifth-highest Composite Rating of 92, out of a possible 99. The higher CR performers in the group are Integrated Device Technology (IDTI), ARM Holdings (ARMH), Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) and Inphi (IPHI).Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

With Skyworks unwilling to nudge up its offer, PMC-Sierra terminated the deal and will pay Skyworks an $88.5 million breakup fee.Skyworks initially bid $10.50 a share in cash on Oct. 5. Microsemi offered stock and cash two weeks later — $9.04 plus 0.771 share. Skyworks upped its offer to $11.60, but Microsemi tweaked its bid to $9.22 plus 0.771 share, equal to $12.01 at Monday's close.Skyworks stuck with its recently raised guidance. But Skyworks, which rode Apple iPhone and other smartphone demand to a long streak of accelerating profit and sales growth, has reported three straight quarters of decelerating earnings per share, with analysts expecting another four quarters of smaller EPS gains.Apple Chip Suppliers DiversifyOther Apple suppliers also are making acquisitions to diversify.

662,SWKS,"Semiconductor consolidation slammed Mentor Graphics (MENT) stock late Thursday, after the maker of software used to design chips guided fiscal Q4 far below Wall Street expectations, as it loses customers to M&As.
"
663,SWKS,"Mentor Graphics stock plunged as much as 30% in after-hours trading after the company released its fiscal Q3 results and gave its guidance. Shares rose a fraction in the regular session, to near a 14-year high of 28.09 touched on Nov. 11.
"
664,SWKS,"For its Q3 ended Oct. 31, Mentor reported $290.5 million in sales and 28 cents earnings per share minus items, narrowly missing the consensus of eight analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $291.8 million and 29 cents.

665,SWKS,"Sales declined 1% and EPS ex items fell 18% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Since March 2011, sales have only declined twice and EPS just three times.

666,SWKS,"Both measures, however, beat Mentor's own guidance, given three months ago.

677,SWKS,"Apple (AAPL) iPhone supplier Qorvo (QRVO) is better-positioned to grow than low-band radio-frequency (RF) rival Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) as infrastructure upgrades spur data usage and demand for increasingly advanced chips, Citigroup analyst Atif Malik said Thursday.Malik upgraded Qorvo stock to neutral from a sell rating on the likelihood of continued content gains in Apple's iPhone 7 following increased dollar content in Samsung's Galaxy S7 and Apple's iPhone SE. And Qorvo's high-end BAW (bulk acoustic wave) filters will be key to breaking into the carrier aggregation market.But Skyworks was downgraded, as it lacks premium filters necessary to hit the carrier aggregation market, and has seen increased competition amid dual sourcing in the low-band market.""We could become constructive on the stock is Skyworks can accelerate its diversification strategy,"" Malik wrote in a research report. ""Mobile (is) still 80% of the overall sales.""Malik cut his fiscal 2017 earnings per share view on Skyworks to 3% below broad expectations which would be $6. The consensus model of 24 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters is for $6.18. His fiscal 2017 Qorvo model is roughly in line with Wall Street for $4.90.Skyworks stock dipped 0.6% on the stock market today, trailing shares of top rivals Qorvo and Broadcom (AVGO), up less than 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively. Apple added 0.7%.On average, RF chipmaker stocks are up 20% since early May on Apple's iPhone 7 ramp-up and better-than-expected Q2 mobile demand in China, Malik wrote. He expects continued iPhone 6S inventory burn ahead of the iPhone 7 launch, expected in September.But Skyworks stock is underperforming Malik's estimate as well as IBD's 41-company Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless industry group and key competitors Broadcom and Qorvo. Since early May, Skyworks stock is up 2% vs. 24.5% and 12% increases in Qorvo and Broadcom stocks. Broadly, fabless chipmakers are up 12%.

678,SWKS,"Ride-hailing app Lyft tapped the Silicon Valley matchmaker that wheeled Microsoft's (MSFT) $26.2 billion LinkedIn (LNKD) acquisition to help it raise funds or find a buyer, anonymous sources told the Wall Street Journal.Qatalyst Partners founder and Executive Chairman Frank Quattrone, a well known Silicon Valley deal maker,  has contacted companies, including carmakers, about acquiring a large stake in Lyft, the sources said. That stake could be a total takeover.Qatalyst has nearly $190.5 billion in deals listed on its website since 2008, including $41.6 billion in pending deals. Notably, it helped broker the $10.6 billion acquisition of KLA-Tencor (KLAC) by Lam Research (LRCX) and Microsemi's (MSCC) $2.5 billion PMC-Sierra buy against rival bidder Skyworks Solutions (SWKS).Lyft, which declined comment to IBD, is Uber Technologies' largest U.S. rival but pales in size, according to Fortune's list of unicorns. Lyft was last valued at $5.5 billion vs. Uber's $62 billion valuation (likely near $68 billion now) and Didi Chuxing's $16 billion value.Apple (AAPL)-backed Didi is giving Uber a greater run for its money in China, where Didi's ride-hailing app dominates in more than 400 cities to Uber's 60 cities. Didi's recent fundraising added $7 billion and includes infusions from Apple, Baidu (BIDU) and Tencent (TCEHY).Lyft's Qatalyst hire could mean it's seeking a sale or doubling down on its fundraising efforts against Uber. Recently, No. 1 carmaker General Motors (GM) invested $500 million for a 10% stake in Lyft -- a sixth of Lyft's total estimated value.Toyota Motor (TM) bet an undisclosed amount on Uber, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU) is said to be in talks with Uber to make autonomous vehicles. Fiat is also developing a self-driving minivan with Google (GOOGL) and has said it would partner with Apple.Tesla Motors (TSLA), too, is grinding away on the self-driving car route and chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) are champing at the bit with autonomous driving platforms.Other investments in this field include a $300 million investment by Volkswagen (VLKAY) in Israeli ride-hailing app Gett, and Google's expansion of its Waze app to test out a carpooling service in San Francisco.

679,SWKS,"This week's insider trades include sales from executives at Tesla Motors (TSLA), Schlumberger (SLB), Apple (AAPL) supplier Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Edwards Lifesciences (EW) and Continental Resources (CLR).Vice President of Engineering Douglas Field disclosed on Thursday that he sold 1,000 shares for $230 a share, or $230,916.Field was recruited by Tesla in 2013 from Apple, where he served as vice president of Mac Hardware engineering, to head the electric vehicle maker's new-car development program.The tech giants have engaged in what some have called a ""poaching war,"" hiring each other's executives. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has even dismissed Apple as a ""Tesla Graveyard,"" saying the iPhone maker hires people that Tesla fires.Electrek in April reported that Apple had hired former Tesla VP of Vehicle Engineering Chris Porritt for a ""special project,"" further fueling speculation that Apple is developing its own vehicle.Tesla Motors shares closed down 0.8% for the week, erasing solid gains, on reports that safety regulators are probing Tesla's suspension and the company's nondisclosure agreements.The oilfield services giant's CEO, Paal Kibsgaaard, on Monday disclosed the sale of 32,857 Schlumberger shares for $2.63 million, amid a rally in oil prices.The energy industry has been hit hard as oil and gas prices plunged the last couple of years, prompting Schlumberger and rivals Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) to cut tens of thousands of jobs.But the uptrend in oil has brought drilling back to life, with the U.S. oil rig count rising in recent weeks.Schlumberger shares are up 3.8% for the week.Chairman David Aldrich reported Thursday the sale of 15,000 shares of the Apple chip supplier in a transaction valued at about $1 million.Prior to being named chairman in May 2014, Aldrich had served as the company's chief executive since Skyworks was formed in 2002 via a merger between Alpha Industries, where he was president and CEO, and Conexant Systems.Citigroup downgraded Skyworks Thursday, saying that rival Qorvo (QRVO) is better positioned to grow. Citi cut its fiscal 2017 earnings per share view on Skyworks to 3% below consensus of $6.18, which would be $6.Skyworks shares are down 2.1% this week.

681,SWKS,"Broadcom (AVGO) CEO Hock Tan hinted Thursday at Apple's (AAPL) ""imminent"" recovery, thanks to its iPhone 7 ramp, MKM analyst Ing Ing said Friday after Tan guided to 20% sequential wireless growth in the July quarter and increased content in the 7 vs. the iPhone 6S.Sales of Apple's iPhone 6S have largely disappointed. In April, Apple reported its first year-over-year decline in iPhone sales. The July quarter will be ""a very different picture,"" Tan told analysts Thursday during the company's Q2 earnings conference call.A ""large North American customer"" -- widely assumed to be Apple -- is ramping up its next flagship smartphone with a ""substantial"" increase in Broadcom content, Tan said on the call. That will likely increase again in October, he said.IBD Take: Broadcom ranks No. 7 in its big group. Find out why at IBD Stock Checkup.""A strong Apple smartphone cycle appears imminent,"" Ing wrote in a research report Friday as he boosted his price target on Broadcom stock to 188 from 162. Ing reiterated his buy rating on Broadcom stock.Ing was one of at least 16 analysts Friday to boost their price targets on Broadcom stock following the company's fiscal Q2 earnings report late Thursday. Broadcom stock gapped up to a record high of 166 early on the stock market today, and shares were up nearly 5%, to 162.56 at the close.Radio-frequency competitors Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) stocks also lifted early Friday, though Qorvo was down a fraction in morning trading. Broadcom's fiscal Q3 guidance topped the consensus, and it posted a hefty 15-cent Q2 earnings beat on better-than-expected post-Avago merger synergies.Late Thursday, Broadcom reported $792 million in wireless sales, up 38% vs. the year-earlier quarter but missing guidance for $820 million. Wired infrastructure sales soared 440% to $2.06 billion. Enterprise storage and industrial sales came in at $525 million and $182 million, up 12% and down 17%, respectively. Broadcom's Tomahawk switches drove blowout wired revenue, Craig-Hallum analyst Anthony Stoss said Friday.Stoss maintained his buy rating and 200 price target on Broadcom stock, and he sees Broadcom growing its iPhone 7 content by 30% vs. the iPhone 6S, potentially offsetting the possibility of another dip in iPhone unit shipments.Investors are missing the runway on RF chipmakers, Stoss wrote in a research report.""We expect at least several more years of additional content gains due to more bands, carrier aggregation and additional RF filters,"" he wrote. ""We believe the expected launch of 5G in 2020 will only add to the content gains and RF flexibility.""He also expects Broadcom's appetite for M&A might be growing. Broadcom paid off $565 million of debt in Q2 and expects to pay $1 billion in Q3 with cash from divestitures, such as the sale of its Internet of Things unit to Cypress Semiconductor (CY).Analysts have posited Broadcom could make a play for small chipmaker Xilinx (XLNX). Fellow Apple supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) has also been thrown into the hypothetical Xilinx bidder mix. In 2015, chip sector M&A topped $115 billion.""We believe Broadcom will be in a position to make an additional acquisition or two by the end of this calendar year,"" Stoss wrote. ""Broadcom has demonstrated the ability to extract substantial value and reap the benefits of scale through accretive acquisitions.""

683,SWKS,"Broadcom (AVGO) stock rocketed late Thursday after its first post-merger earnings report, topping Wall Street's earnings view by 15 cents and edging revenue views despite Apple's (AAPL) first year-over-year decline in iPhone sales.In after-hours trading, Broadcom stock was up more than 6% following its fiscal Q2 earnings release.

The former Avago bought Broadcom for $37 billion, a deal that closed on Feb. 1, keeping the Broadcom name and Avago's ticker. Now, analysts say Broadcom could deleverage and seek more M&A.Broadcom competes against fellow Apple suppliers Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) to provide radio-frequency chips for smartphones, including the iPhone.A UBS analyst was bullish earlier Thursday on RF names vs. analog names like Analog Devices (ADI) and Texas Instruments (TXN), both also Apple suppliers who've seen investors pull back because of the companies' consumer exposure.

685,SWKS,"Apple (AAPL) chip suppliers Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Qorvo (QRVO) stocks lifted Monday on a bullish RBC Capital report that sees fellow chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) reaching $16 earnings per share on merger synergies and iPhone 7 content gains.But Broadcom's Q2 wireless sales will likely dip $40 million to $50 million on slowing current-generation iPhone sales, RBC Capital analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in the research report. He rates Broadcom stock his top semiconductor pick, with a 180 price target.Over the next two years, Broadcom stock could reach 200, Daryanani says.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Broadcom stock was up nearly 1% to 148.10. But it trailed shares of InvenSense (INVN) and Qorvo, which jumped 2.8% to 5.98 and 2% to 50.40, respectively. Cirrus Logic, Skyworks and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) stocks were up 2.8%, 1.9% and 1.5%, respectively.NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) stock was up 0.6%, while Integrated Device Technology (IDTI) was up a fraction.Broadcom is slated to report its Q2 earnings after the close June 2. Daryanani expects Broadcom to miss consensus expectations for $3.55 billion in sales on petering Apple iPhone sales, despite stronger-than-expected Samsung Galaxy S7 sales.Apple comprises 15% of Broadcom's sales, Daryanani estimates, with Samsung in the high single digits. Apple's June-quarter guidance implies 40 million iPhones shipped vs. consensus views for 44 million. Near term, Apple will pose a headwind until the iPhone 7, expected to be released in September, ramps up.""To that end, Broadcom's FBAR (film bulk acoustic resonator) business could see double-digit year-over-year growth driven by content gains,"" Daryanani wrote. Wi-Fi combo chips could also see modest average sales prices tailwinds.Earlier, Broadcom saw wireless account for 23% of sales. Daryanani expects that segment to grow 37% quarter over quarter as the company's recent merger is factored. The former Avago Technologies bought Broadcom for $37 million in February, but kept the Broadcom name.Storage sales will likely become ""incrementally worse,"" Daryanani wrote. Western Digital (WDC) and Seagate Technologies' (STX) recent earnings suggest a $100 million hard-disk drive total addressable market in March and a $95 million TAM in June, down 20% and 15% vs. last year.Enterprise storage is expected to account for 17% of Broadcom's Q2 sales. Daryanani sees the segment declining 14% vs. Q1, vs. 6% sequential growth in the prior quarter.

That production target is also the highest in about two years.The iPhone 7 is due out in September and could give Apple the boost it needs after the company reported its first-ever quarterly decline in iPhone sales last month.Shares closed up 1.3% in below-average volume, hitting their highest level in nearly a month. But the stock still has a lot of recovering to do after gapping down on its latest quarterly report, as it’s down about 27% from its 52-week high.Meanwhile, Apple chip suppliers Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Broadcom (AVGO), Qorvo (QRVO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) are also getting a boost from the report.Taiwan Semiconductor rallied 1.5% in light turnover, but hit resistance at its 50-day line. Shares are trading 7% below their March high and a flat-base buy point of 26.72.Broadcom climbed 1% in below-average volume, but it’s also hitting resistance at the 50-day line. Broadcom's stock is 7% below its April peak and a potential buy point.Qorvo rose 2% in big volume after having retaken its 50-day and 200-day moving averages in Friday’s session. The stock is nearing a cup-with-handle buy point of 52.05, but it’s trading 42% below its high reached last June.Skyworks added 1.9% in fast trade, but it’s still 41% below its June high.

687,SWKS,"Apple (AAPL) supplier Broadcom (AVGO) likely gained another 20% in iPhone 7 content on top of continued increases in Samsung Galaxy smartphones, giving investors ""multiple ways to win,"" Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer said Thursday.Broadcom is slated to report Q2 earnings on June 2 after the market close. Pitzer expects in-line Q2 sales, but he sees a ""significant EPS cushion"" on cost-cutting and synergies related to Broadcom's merger with the former Avago. In February, Avago completed its $37 billion acquisition of Broadcom, with the merged company taking the Broadcom name, in a deal the companies said gives the combined entity an enterprise value of $77 billion.For Q2, the consensus of 30 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expects Broadcom to report $3.55 billion in sales and $2.38 earnings per share minus items, up 116% and 12%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter.On Wednesday, fellow Apple supplier Analog Devices (ADI) reported year-over-year sales declines for fiscal Q2 and guided to another 5% sales dip for its July quarter. Pitzer expects Broadcom's July-quarter sales view to likewise disappoint.But, like Analog Devices, Broadcom expects to grow its iPhone 7 content. Three months ago, CEO Hock Tan said Broadcom's radio-frequency (RF) content in smartphones has increased by 20% every year, and that this year will be no exception.Tan's view came before Apple reported its first-ever decline in iPhone sales, occurring in the March quarter.Pitzer sees Broadcom guiding to $3.39 billion in fiscal Q3 sales, below the consensus view for $3.72 billion. But he boosted his EPS-minus-items view to $2.64 from $2.51, matching the consensus model. For 2016 and 2017, he expects $11.16 and $12.86 EPS ex items, respectively.Wireless sales -- including sales to Apple -- have declined to 25% of total revenue from 50%. Less volatile data center sales now account for half of Broadcom's revenue, he wrote.""Broadcom's portfolio of businesses is significantly dampening the impact of any single headwind,"" he wrote in a research report. ""Broadcom can weather 'isolated storms' while maintaining the integrity of EPS upside.""Pitzer reiterated an outperform rating and a 180 price target on Broadcom stock. Broadcom shares fell a fraction, to 142.74, on the stock market today. RF rivals Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) fell 1.2% and a fraction, respectively.The trio fell amid fresh reports examining the effect slowing smartphone sales will have on chipmakers.
"
688,SWKS,"Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7 expectations might have dug into guidance provided Wednesday by Analog Devices (ADI), as the 3D Touch supplier topped Q2 expectations but guided to current-quarter sales that would dip 5% year over year.In early trading on the stock market today, Analog Devices shares were up a fraction, near 55.50. Fellow Apple suppliers Broadcom (AVGO), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) were up all by close to 2% or more.For its fiscal Q2 ended April 30, Analog Devices reported $779 million in sales and 64 cents earnings per share ex items, down a respective 5% and 12% vs. the year-earlier quarter. It was the first quarter in nine that Analog Devices' sales have fallen and the second period of declining EPS.But both metrics beat the consensus of 29 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $777.6 million and 62 cents, as well as Analog Devices' own guidance issued three months ago.Consumer sales toppled 27% year over year, leading a 3% fall in communications sales, Analog Devices said. Industrial and automotive sales -- Analog Devices' bread-and-butter segments -- fell 1% apiece.For fiscal Q3, Analog Devices CEO Vincent Roche sees a return to consumer market growth and mid- to high-single-digit growth in the company's business-to-business segments. But the high point of ADI's Q3 sales and EPS guidance lagged Wall Street consensus.Analog Devices guided to $800 million to $840 million in sales and 66-74 cents, down a respective 5% and 9% vs. the year-earlier quarter, missing analysts' model for $846.6 million and 75 cents.On average, Analog Devices' Q3 sales have grown 13.5% year over year, trailing 20% growth in Q4. But recent reports indicate Apple might have cut its component orders for the iPhone 7, expected to be released in September.

689,SWKS,"Applied Materials (AMAT) is capable of sourcing 100 million Apple (AAPL) iPhone screens amid its OLED push, a UBS analyst said Thursday as chipmakers Analog Devices (ADI) and Texas Instruments (TXN) got sell ratings from Goldman Sachs on their Apple exposure.Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari initiated coverage of Analog Devices stock with a sell rating, noting the company's 10% Apple exposure, but is neutral on shares of 20%-Samsung-exposed Maxim Integrated Devices (MXIM). Sell-rated Texas Instruments is 30% exposed to consumer sales, Hari said.Investors have ""punished"" analog chipmakers with high mobile exposure, Hari wrote in a research report, as sales of iPhones and other smartphones slow. To that point, Analog Devices stock is in a 253-day period of consolidation, trailing Texas Instruments stock which is now 3% extended beyond its 291-day consolidation period.""The opportunity to take on Apple business is hard for analog companies to turn down given relatively high margins and incremental revenue opportunities, (but) investors have been critical of such moves and we do not expect this trend to reverse in the near future,"" he wrote.Margin expansion, not sales growth, drives analog outperformance, Hari wrote. Texas Instruments has aggressively reduced costs, but Maxim still has some ""juice to squeeze"" and Analog Devices' gross and operating margins have stagnated since 2010, he says.Among chip stocks, Hari prefers NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), radio-frequency suppliers Broadcom (AVGO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), and ""growth stock"" Nvidia (NVDA), a Tesla Motors (TSLA) partner. The four buy-rated stocks have weathered volatile consumer sales better than analog chipmakers, he says.Hari boosted his price target on Applied Materials stock to 27 from 25 and kept his buy rating, noting the company's OLED (organic light-emitting diode) and 3D Nand (flash memory) push and Chinese business could drive earnings per share minus items to $1.81 and $2.10 in calendar years 2016 and 2017. For its fiscal 2015 ended Oct. 25, Applied reported EPS minus items of $1.19.UBS analyst Stephen Chin sees Applied Materials bolstering its EPS by 80 cents annually, assuming the TV market, like the smartphone market, also adopts OLED screens. OLED screens are thinner and more flexible than other display screens, and is expected to be a feature in Apple's iPhone 8, expected to be released in the fall of 2017. So far, Apple uses OLEDs on just one product, the Apple Watch.Chin has a buy rating and 28.50 price target on Applied Materials stock.In total, Applied Materials could pump out 33 million OLED screens for the iPhone each month, Chin estimates.""We estimate Applied can generate incremental EPS of 15 cents next year just from selling its OLED equipment to Apple iPhone,"" Chin wrote in a report. ""We estimate this base case OLED EPS impact from smartphones is sustainable for a few years as more customers possibly adopt OLED screens.""Applied Materials stock finished 0.5% higher on the stock market today. Analog Devices stock dipped 0.65%.

694,SWKS,"Semiconductor sales are still rising after a stellar year in 2014, but the pace is slowing. On Monday, industry trade group, the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) said that worldwide chip sales rose 2% to $84 billion in the second quarter from the same period a year earlier. But that was down from a solid 10.8% increase last year.
"
695,SWKS,"For the month of June, chip sales rose 2% year-over-year to $28 billion. But sales eased 0.4% from May's totals. Regionally, demand was strongest in China and the Americas, where sales climbed 7.8% and 5.6%, respectively. But sales slumped 13.6% in Japan and 11.5% in Europe.""Macroeconomic headwinds and softening demand have slowed global semiconductor market growth somewhat, but the industry still posted its highest-ever second-quarter sales and remains ahead of the pace of sales set in 2014, which was a record year for semiconductor revenues,"" noted SIA President and Chief Executive John Neuffer in a press release.Last year, global semiconductor sales jumped nearly 10% to a record $335.8 billion. According to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS), sales are expected to reach $347 billion this year, which would represent growth of 3.3%. Industry sales are slated to reach $359 billion in 2016 and $370 billion in 2017.Chips are in electronic devices such as computers, smartphones, tablets, TVs, radios, medical equipment and automobiles.Leading semiconductor stocks have put on mixed performances amid tough market conditions. Last week, chipmaker Qorvo (QRVO) plunged nearly 20% on a weak outlook for the current quarter.In late June, Qorvo wiped out a 13% gain from a 78.10 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. Then in late July, it fell 8% below the 78.10 trigger. Both marked sell signals.Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), which had been in a strong uptrend, continues to unravel. The stock triggered a sell signal in early July by falling 8% under a 102.87 entry from a flat base.Worries over growth at tech heavyweight Apple (AAPL) have weighed on Apple suppliers such as Skyworks Solutions and Avago Technologies (AVGO).Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO) extended a six-week slide Monday. Shares of the the Taiwan-based firm already dropped 8% last week despite news of better-than-expected second-quarter earnings and record sales.But NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) is showing better action. It jumped 7% and halted a five-week slide last week. But it now faces resistance at its 10-week moving average.Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI) is another that is firming up. Last week, the stock breached a low from late April but staged a big upside reversal.In Monday's paper, the Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless group ranked 37th, down from 24 three weeks ago. But the Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing group was at 159th.

"
882,SWKS,"A good stock idea isn't much use if you don't understand what you're looking at. Is it an institutional-quality stock? Is it a cyclical play that probably will only profit from its industry cycle? Is it a turnaround story that involves the fixing of a company problem? Is it a fad stock that will run hot until people tire of the novelty?
"
883,SWKS,"The strategy and target will differ for each of these situations, and it will vary by the kind of uptrend the market is in.Peg the stock wrong or the market wrong, and you will probably lose money or at least make less than you should.If an investor is going to make big money, institutional-quality stocks, operating in a strong uptrend, will most often be the investor's best choice. However, there are times when a cyclical stock, turnaround or fad stock can deliver good gains.Where can an investor find or identify great stock ideas? Your Weekly Review (YWR), also known as the 85-85 list, is a good place to look in Friday's IBD.In this screen, stocks must score an 85 in EPS Rating and in Relative Price Strength Rating. The 85 means that the stocks must be in the top 15 percentile among stocks in IBD's database. Stocks also must be within 15% of a 12-month high.Charts are listed by industry group, but charts aren't printed for every stock. Additional stocks are listed in the fine-print listing on the last page of YWR, today on A8.The big net makes the 85-85 a good place to look for stock ideas. A low-hurdle screen will pick up more cyclicals, turnarounds and fad stocks than a high-hurdle screen.Some people sneer at ""fad stocks."" They argue that such stocks are dangerous, won't last and aren't for serious investors.Well, all stocks are dangerous. While fad stocks might have a shorter life, sometimes all we're talking about is a solid company indirectly benefiting from a fad.For example, egg producer and distributor Cal-Maine Foods (CALM) rode the Atkins diet to big stock gains in 2003.In other cases, fads develop into longer-lasting trends.For instance, Deckers Outdoor (DECK) bought UGG Holdings in August 1995 and eventually turned the Ugg boots — once popular mostly with surfers — into a broader fashion trend.From October 2002 to October 2011, Deckers Outdoors shares rose 9,193%, with Uggs deserving much of the credit.How might the 85-85 be used?Let's look at the 85-85 screen that was published in IBD on Oct. 24, 2014, not long after a market low and the Oct. 21 follow-through day. A follow-through day soon after a market low is often the best time to scout for breakouts, retaking of buy points and bounces off the 10-week moving average, as seen in the minicharts.An investor could've found five institutional-quality stocks in the 85-85 that soon set valid entries: Apple (AAPL), Celgene (CELG), Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Illumina (ILMN) and Skyworks (SWKS). Gains varied from 15% to 79%.Four cyclicals in the 85-85 eventually offered entries: Landstar System (LSTR), Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL), FedEx (FDX) and Lennar (LEN). Gains ran from 11% to 15%.Turnarounds and fads were scarce.The market itself was and had been choppy, which is why taking a 10% to 15% profit in Apple was prudent.

""It will take several years for China to disrupt new semiconductor markets, but disruptions — notably margin risk — could end up being significant for established players and for the global chip market overall.""Morgan Stanley analysts said China is not spreading its investments broadly, but instead pushing for ""national champions"" in semiconductor segments.""These include one national manufacturing champion Semiconductor Manufacturing International, one assembly subcontractor (Jiangsu Changjiang Electronics Technology), likely local DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) and Nand flash-memory production and one semi equipment company and a few fabless companies such as Spreadtrum Communications and HiSilicon,"" according to Morgan Stanley's report.Opportunities for non-Chinese firms include partnerships such as the one that Intel (INTC) has with Spreadtrum Communications and Rockchip Electronics, and Qualcomm 's (QCOM) joint venture with Semiconductor Manufacturing International.Morgan Stanley analysts also expect opportunities for chip technology licensing companies such as ARM Holdings (ARMH) to find new customers and for chip equipment makers to find new customers.

1060,SWKS,"Apple (AAPL) chip suppliers tumbled Monday on Wall Street after a German iPhone 6S chip supplier guided Q4 revenue growth down to single digits, a day before Apple is expected to report colossal earnings.Dialog Semiconductor's 20% dip in shares could also hurt its $4.6 billion attempt to acquire Silicon Valley chip gear maker Atmel (ATML). In September, Dialog valued Atmel at $10.42 per share. Now, the deal is worth 20% less.In early trading, Atmel stock dropped more than 10%.For Q4, Dialog guided to $430 million to $460 million in revenue, which would be down 1% to up 6% vs. the year-earlier quarter.Apple stock dropped more than 3% by early afternoon on the stock market today. But, the iPhone peddler's chip suppliers fell harder. Cirrus Logic (CRUS) stock took the biggest hit at 13%, ahead of the company's scheduled Q4 earnings report Wednesday.Qorvo (QRVO) stock dipped 8%. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) stock fell nearly 6%. Shares of Avago (AVGO) and Broadcom (BRCM) — set to merge next year — were down almost 5%. Qualcomm (QCOM) stock suffered the least, down 3%.Late Tuesday, Apple is expected to report $51.1 billion in Q4 sales, up 21% vs. the year-earlier quarter, according to 50 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. The consensus also models 32% earnings growth to $1.88 earnings per share minus items.Both measures would show decceleration. Earnings have topped 40% growth for three sequential quarters. Revenue growth hasn't dipped below 25% over the same time period.Apple's December guidance is key and could dispel worries of an ""iPhone 6 hangover,"" FBR analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a research report.""We view tomorrow's earnings as a seminal event for (CEO Tim) Cook to prove the iPhone 6S skeptics wrong with a sub 70 million iPhone guide viewed as bearish,"" he wrote.Earlier this month, Apple chip suppliers took a severe hit upon reports that, despite then-record iPhone 6S series shipments, the smartphone giant had stepped down its Q4 intelligence-chip orders.Then, insiders said Apple would reduce its Q4 expectations to 65 million to 70 million smartphones sold.Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

1061,SWKS,"Will Microsemi tie the knot with PMC-Sierra, or will it be left waiting in the wings? The jury is still out on whether Microsemi (MSCC) or Apple (AAPL) supplier Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) will win over PMC in a potential bidding war that has emerged between the two chipmakers.Here's how the saga has unfolded: On Oct. 19, Microsemi submitted a bid to acquire semiconductor firm PMC-Sierra (PMCS) for about $2.4 billion, or $11.50 per PMC share based on the closing stock price of Microsemi on Oct. 16. The bid topped Skyworks' earlier all-cash bid valued at roughly $2 billion, or $10.50 a share, announced after the close on Oct. 5.Under the terms of Microsemi's proposal, PMC shareholders will receive $8.75 in cash and 0.0736 of a share of Microsemi common stock for each share of PMC common stock. Microsemi put the offer at a 50% premium to PMC's closing price on Oct. 5.The implied total transaction is valued at about $2.4 billion, and the implied enterprise value is $2.2 billion, net of PMC's net cash balance on June 27, according to Microsemi.'Engage In Discussions'On Oct. 20, PMC acknowledged receipt of Microsemi's unsolicited bid: ""PMC's board of directors believes, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the Microsemi proposal would reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal ... so it has determined to engage in discussions with Microsemi.""But PMC says that there can be no ""assurances that any definitive agreement or transaction"" will result from Microsemi's offer and that it has yet to determine whether Microsemi's offer constitutes a ""superior proposal"" over Skyworks' bid.Still, PMC adds that its board continues to recommend the merger pact with Skyworks. The boards of both Skyworks and PMC have approved the transaction between the two companies, which is expected to close in the first half of calendar 2016, subject to PMC shareholders' OK, Skyworks said.Microsemi provides chips for communications, defense, security, aerospace and industrial markets. Products include high-performance analog and FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays) — chips that can be reprogrammed to desired application or functionality requirements after manufacturing; timing and synchronization devices; power management products; voice-processing devices; radio-frequency chips; security technologies; scalable anti-tamper products; and others.PMC's portfolio enables many different types of communications-network infrastructure equipment in the storage, mobile and optical networks market segments.Microsemi is no stranger to acquisitions, having purchased more than 40 companies. In the last five years, it's completed a number of large, transformative acquisitions, including Actel, Zarlink, Symmetricom and most recently Vitesse Semiconductor in April.Microsemi is expected to put up a good fight to come out a winner.""I think Microsemi really wants this deal and expect they will continue to pursue PMC,"" Raymond James analyst Steven Smigie told IBD. ""For Skyworks, the deal helps them diversify their business a little. It's helpful for them. But they don't have a hole in their portfolio where they need to buy PMC.""Smigie says the PMC transaction is the type of deal Microsemi likes.""(PMC) is struggling a bit, and there's a lot of costs they can take out,"" he said. ""It's a good fit with Microsemi with the type of portfolio Microsemi typically buys. My feeling from speaking to management over time: this (company) is something Microsemi will be more aggressive about buying. My thinking is Microsemi is more likely to win at end of day.""According to the company, Microsemi and PMC have been in negotiations for the past 18 months.Microsemi has much to gain from acquiring PMC.""We believe this transaction offers compelling strategic and financial benefits for the shareholders of both Microsemi and PMC,"" Microsemi CEO James Peterson said. ""This acquisition will provide Microsemi with a leading position in high-performance and scalable storage solutions targeted for data-center and cloud applications while also adding a complementary portfolio of high-value communications products.""Microsemi expects the transaction to be immediately accretive to Microsemi's non-GAAP earnings per share and free cash flow. Microsemi estimates more than 60 cents of non-GAAP EPS accretion in the first full year after closing the transaction.Microsemi sees greater than $100 million in total cost synergies, with $75 million in operating savings realized in the first full quarter of the combined operations.Robust GrowthMicrosemi has been faring handsomely on the financial front with its current mix.It's seen six straight quarters of double-digit earnings growth. In the third quarter, earnings rose 17% to 68 cents a share. Sales increased 8.5% to $317.1 million.Revenue in its aerospace segment was up 16% from a year earlier in the third quarter, propelled by strength in commercial-air end markets, Peterson said on the quarter's conference call. Commercial-air end markets saw ""record results in booking, benefiting from strong industry fundamentals, (and) increasing content on next-generation aircraft,"" he said.The company's defense end markets ""are recovering and poised to take a leadership role in driving future results,"" he added.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year earnings to rise 24% to $2.72 a share. They expect a 16% gain in 2016.In announcing the bid for PMC, Microsemi said that it expects fourth-quarter EPS of 72 to 74 cents, in line with prior guidance.Microsemi intends to fund the PMC transaction and repay its existing credit facility with existing cash, $2.7 billion in new transaction debt and about $600 million in Microsemi common stock.Shareholders of Microsemi would own roughly 85% of the combined entity after completion of the transaction, and PMC shareholders would own 15%.Meanwhile, Microsemi's stock fell 5.43% on Monday, Oct. 19, the day it announced the deal. It then slipped Tuesday and Wednesday, recovering Thursday and Friday for a 2.9% loss for the week, closing at 36.26, just a hair below its all-time high set in the prior week.""They levered up a lot to get the deal done,"" said Smigie. ""The environment is soft out there, and (having a lot of debt) makes people a little nervous. Also, we've been seeing a big run in the stock, and a lot of people might want to cash out.""Another reason for the stock decline may be some ""fears"" that there could be a bidding war that ""could force Microsemi to either increase the amount of debt, or it's going to have to give away more stock, which would make it more costly for them,"" he added.Microsemi is a part of IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group, where it earns a 94 IBD Composite Rating out of a possible 99. Other members of the group include Analog Devices (ADI) and Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), both of which have 95 Composite Ratings.

1095,SWKS,"Sales of advanced car safety systems for automakers surged in supplier Mobileye's estimate-beating third quarter, sending its stock up Tuesday.
"
1096,SWKS,"With new cars now capable of collision avoidance by keeping a car in-lane, and automatically braking on their own, the auto industry is on its way to self-driving cars. The safety systems use cameras and sensors. Mobileye (MBLY) supplies advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) — its software algorithms, system-on-chips and customer applications are based on processing visual information from cameras, to do things like detect lanes and barriers and read traffic signs.
"
1097,SWKS,"Israel-based Mobileye's products go into cars from 23 automakers including BMW, Ford (F), General Motors (GM), Nissan, Volvo, Volkswagen's (VLKAY) Audi and Hyundai.

1103,SWKS,"Mobileye stock rose 2.7% Tuesday, to 46.77. The company made its IPO, at 25, in August 2014, and peaked at 64.48 on Aug. 17.
"
1104,SWKS,"Mobileye reported Q3 revenue of $70.6 million, up 104% from the year-earlier quarter, where analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected just $67.4 million. About $10 million came from aftermarket system sales and the rest from the automaker industry, as original equipment manufacturing (OEM) revenue.

1119,SWKS,"Tech firms working in autonomous driving with sensor-and-camera setups also include NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Nvidia (NVDA), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Avago Technologies (AVGO) and Ambarella (AMBA).Sales of advanced car safety systems for automakers surged in supplier Mobileye's estimate-beating third quarter, sending its stock up Tuesday.With new cars now capable of collision avoidance by keeping a car in-lane, and automatically braking on their own, the auto industry is on its way to self-driving cars. The safety systems use cameras and sensors. Mobileye (MBLY) supplies advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) — its software algorithms, system-on-chips and customer applications are based on processing visual information from cameras, to do things like detect lanes and barriers and read traffic signs.Israel-based Mobileye's products go into cars from 23 automakers including BMW, Ford (F), General Motors (GM), Nissan, Volvo, Volkswagen's (VLKAY) Audi and Hyundai.Along with making progress on existing business for its EyeQ3 processor platform, during the quarter Mobileye launched it on Nissan (NSANY) vehicles in Asia, with TRW as the tier-one auto supplier involved.""This launch includes autonomous emergency braking, or AEB, for avoiding collision with both vehicles and pedestrians, and we expect this same program to extend to the U.S. in Q4,"" Mobileye CEO Ziv Aviram said on a morning conference call with analysts.On advanced work that Mobileye has been doing, Aviram said: ""Recently we launched our first deep learning functions on Tesla 's (TSLA) 'Autopilot' feature.""How Tesla Autopilot SeesThey include ""semantic free space,"" he added, ""which uses every pixel in the scene to help us understand where are the curbs, barriers, guardrails, moving objects and anything that's not part of the driving path.""Mobileye stock rose 2.7% Tuesday, to 46.77. The company made its IPO, at 25, in August 2014, and peaked at 64.48 on Aug. 17.Mobileye reported Q3 revenue of $70.6 million, up 104% from the year-earlier quarter, where analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected just $67.4 million. About $10 million came from aftermarket system sales and the rest from the automaker industry, as original equipment manufacturing (OEM) revenue.Mobileye earned 15 cents a share, up from 4 cents in Q3 2014, 2 cents above analyst estimates.The company raised full-year revenue guidance to a range of $238 million to $240 million, up from $235 million to $239 million. It guided EPS up to 46-47 cents a share, from a prior range of 44-45 cents. Analyst consensus calls for 2015 EPS of 45 cents on sales of $238.4 million.In what turned out to be a hint of Mobileye's Q3 report, one of its largest tier-1 supplier partners, Delphi (DLPH), reported better-than-expected active safety systems growth in its Q3 report last week.Analysts see developing car-safety regulations as key to sales of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), like Mobileye makes.Mobileye CEO Aviram notes that autonomous braking is in the process of being regulated worldwide.""The NCAP star safety rating standards in Europe, Japan, Korea and soon in the U.S. all are promoting AEB as a key active safety feature, and we believe that we will benefit significantly as the demand for these features increases in the coming years.""He added that in September, 10 original equipment manufacturers made the joint announcement with Nissan and the Insurance Institute For Highway Safety that they plan to offer AEB as a standard feature in the U.S.""Mobileye is already working with the vast majority of these automakers,"" Aviram said on the call.Self-Driving CarsMobileye's technology supports semiautonomous driving.

1168,SWKS,"IBD research shows that the 600 best-performing stocks between 1952 and 2001 had one thing in common: strong earnings growth. ""During bull markets (major market uptrends), I prefer to concentrate on stocks that show powerful earnings gains of 40% to 500% or more,"" IBD founder and Chairman William J. O'Neil wrote in ""How to Make Money in Stocks.""
"
1169,SWKS,"The ""C"" in IBD's CAN SLIM investing system stands for current quarterly earnings. Companies whose profit is rising sharply tend to be those that are operating efficiently or offer superior products and services. Dell, Cisco Systems (CSCO) and America Online (AOL) were among stocks whose big advances were fueled by strong earnings growth.
"
1170,SWKS,"Strong earnings growth is defined as a minimum 25% increase in quarterly earnings per share compared to the year-earlier quarter. Such numbers tend to produce an Earnings Per Share Rating of 80 or higher on a scale of 1 to 99, a level that investors should look for when creating watch lists of the best growth stocks.
"
1171,SWKS,"""You have thousands of stocks to choose from. Why not buy the very best merchandise available?"" O'Neil wrote.
"
1172,SWKS,"Accelerating gains are even better. Stocks with the best potential tend to have two or three quarters of increasing year-over-year profit growth leading up to their breakouts.

"
1175,SWKS,"From a decline of 2% in the fiscal fourth quarter that ended in September 2012, profit rose 8%, 14%, 20%, 21% and 22% in the quarters prior to the breakout. That's five quarters in a row of EPS acceleration.
"
1176,SWKS,"The stock possessed a 93 Composite Rating and a 94 Earnings Per Share Rating when it cleared the buy point. Another key metric — the SMR Rating, which stands for sales, profit margins and return on equity — was a robust A on a scale of A to E.
"
1177,SWKS,"Skyworks offered investors several secondary buying opportunities en route to a gain of more than 350% to date, including a couple of rebounds off its 10-week moving average. Buying on the first two rebounds off a stock's key support line carries less risk than those that occur further along the way up.
"

1180,SWKS,"Listings in the NYSE & Nasdaq Research Tables provide a three-quarter average and a current quarter estimate.IBD research shows that the 600 best-performing stocks between 1952 and 2001 had one thing in common: strong earnings growth. ""During bull markets (major market uptrends), I prefer to concentrate on stocks that show powerful earnings gains of 40% to 500% or more,"" IBD founder and Chairman William J. O'Neil wrote in ""How to Make Money in Stocks.""The ""C"" in IBD's CAN SLIM investing system stands for current quarterly earnings. Companies whose profit is rising sharply tend to be those that are operating efficiently or offer superior products and services. Dell, Cisco Systems (CSCO) and America Online (AOL) were among stocks whose big advances were fueled by strong earnings growth.Strong earnings growth is defined as a minimum 25% increase in quarterly earnings per share compared to the year-earlier quarter. Such numbers tend to produce an Earnings Per Share Rating of 80 or higher on a scale of 1 to 99, a level that investors should look for when creating watch lists of the best growth stocks.""You have thousands of stocks to choose from. Why not buy the very best merchandise available?"" O'Neil wrote.Accelerating gains are even better. Stocks with the best potential tend to have two or three quarters of increasing year-over-year profit growth leading up to their breakouts.""Our analysis of the most successful stocks also showed that, in almost every case, earnings growth accelerated sometime in the 10 quarters before a towering price move began,"" O'Neil wrote.Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) showed accelerating earnings-per-share growth in the quarters leading up to its January 2014 breakout past a 28.66 buy point of a handle on a long first-stage consolidation.From a decline of 2% in the fiscal fourth quarter that ended in September 2012, profit rose 8%, 14%, 20%, 21% and 22% in the quarters prior to the breakout. That's five quarters in a row of EPS acceleration.The stock possessed a 93 Composite Rating and a 94 Earnings Per Share Rating when it cleared the buy point. Another key metric — the SMR Rating, which stands for sales, profit margins and return on equity — was a robust A on a scale of A to E.Skyworks offered investors several secondary buying opportunities en route to a gain of more than 350% to date, including a couple of rebounds off its 10-week moving average. Buying on the first two rebounds off a stock's key support line carries less risk than those that occur further along the way up.Later, in January 2015, Skyworks broke out past a 75.07 buy point of a three-weeks-tight pattern, another follow-on entry, as earnings growth continued to accelerate — rising 54%, 75% and 88% in the quarters leading up to the breakout.You can get a sense of a stock's earnings growth history by going to Stock Checkup tab, located inside the Research tab at investors.com.

1208,SWKS,"Texas Instruments (TXN) and Analog Devices (ADI) could grapple for Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM), which is rumored to be on the sales block amid heavy chip industry M&A action.Maxim stock was up 7% Wednesday afternoon on a report that Texas Instruments was looking to acquire the company. Reports last week had Analog Devices doing the same. Texas Instruments stock was down nearly 1% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, while Analog Devices stock was up a fraction.Bloomberg reported Wednesday that Texas Instruments is in talks to acquire Maxim. Maxim, which has an $11 billion market value, might not sell unless the company's receives a high premium, sources told Bloomberg.An $11 billion offer would actually be on the low end in terms of big chip industry deals this year. Broadcom (BRCM) is being acquired by Apple (AAPL) chip supplier Avago (AVGO) for a whopping $37 billion.That deal, announced in May, was the biggest pure-tech merger — until this month's announced $67 billion merger of Dell and EMC (EMC).In June, Intel (INTC) agreed to buy Altera (ALTR) for $16.7 billion.This month, Lam Research (LRCX) announced it plans to buy KLA-Tencor (KLAC) for $10.6 billion. That same day Western Digital (WDC) said it agreed to acquire SanDisk (SNDK) for $19 billion.Also this month, Microsemi (MSCC) leaped over the bid by Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) in a battle to acquire PMC-Sierra (PMCS), making a $2.4 billion offer.Chip M&A action has ramped amid an industry downturn with slowing growth, increasing costs and competition, and macroeconomic concerns, particularly in China, analysts say.Maxim makes sense for Analog Devices and Texas Instruments, analysts say, and both figure in on the M&A speculation.Texas Instruments CEO Kevin March, however, seemed doubtful of joining the M&A move, in comments during the company's recent Q2 earnings conference call with analysts.""We already have what we believe is a significant scale advantage and we believe we're focused on the two best opportunities that are out there today, being analog and embedded processing,"" March told analysts. ""So those two reasons aren't motivating us to think differently about M&A.""MKM Partners analyst Ian Ing suggested in a research report that Texas Instruments might want to change its M&A tune.""Assuming robust M&A activity, we think the potential exists for the creation of an analog competitor with comparable scale and cost leadership,"" he wrote. ""Texas Instruments may need to respond pre-emptively and become acquisitive.""Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter and on Facebook.

Nasdaq volume was on pace to be slightly higher.Advancing stocks outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by less than 2-to-1. Decliners had a slight edge over advancers on the Nasdaq.Some oil and gas-related groups extended gains as oil rose again. At the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil futures jumped $1.56, or 3.4%, to $47.82 a barrel.Among the day's gainers, Autobytel (ABTL) followed through, rising nearly 8% after Monday's breakout from a double-bottom base with a 19.66 buy point.IBD Sector Leader LGI Homes (LGIH) scored an all-time high, rising 3.5%. It's been a solid performer after a base breakout in early August over a 20.20 buy point. But it's extended after a bounce this week off its 10-week moving average.It's a pretty quiet week of economic data, but the market will be looking closely at the tone of the Fed minutes from the Sept. 17 meeting when they're released Thursday.

1331,SWKS,"Apple (AAPL) and its chip supplier NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) are getting closer to buy territory on the stock market today.Earlier this week, a Morgan Stanley report said that Apple iPhone demand is ahead of expectations for the June quarter. That's good news not only for the iPhone maker itself but also for its suppliers.Apple shares are edging back up near a 133.70 buy point from a flat base. The stock tried to clear that pivot on April 28, but reversed to close the session down 1.6%.And NXP Semiconductors is also nearing buy range in a seesaw session. It's trading just under a 108.60 flat base buy point.

"
1332,SWKS,"Investors looking to buy a great stock should not only study its earnings and sales growth. Be sure to also check out a company's profit margins. Profit margins measure how much a company keeps on every dollar of sales. For example, a company that earns 22 cents for each dollar of sales before taxes has a 22% pretax profit margin.Profit margins are closely watched by Wall Street analysts and fund managers because they provide an indication of a company's fundamental strength.In some cases, a company's margins may be rising because it enjoys strong pricing power due to unique or superior products and services versus the competition.In other cases, a company may be superior at keeping costs low.Rising profit margins can justify higher stock prices. On the other hand, falling profit margins can hurt a stock, especially if they're caused by a company that's cutting prices to sell its products.On Jan. 13, the stock of KB Home (KBH) crashed 16% after the homebuilder warned that margins were declining. The company said it was being squeezed by rising building costs and falling home prices.There are a variety of definitions for profit margin, but IBD focuses on quarterly after-tax and annual pretax margins.Looking only at quarterly margins can be misleading, as some companies' products or services may be influenced by the seasons.For example, Apple's (AAPL) sales tend to rise around Christmas, while those of homebuilders such as KB Home tend to fall in the winter due to harsh weather.In such cases, it's best to compare quarterly after-tax margins to the same period a year earlier.Also, since profit margins vary widely by industry, it's important to compare companies in the same industry.For example, tech stocks like Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) tend to have much wider margins than grocery stores like Kroger (KR) that have famously thin margins.Just because a stock has fat profit margins doesn't mean it's a buy.Investors should look for accelerating quarterly and annual margins. They should be near or at the company's historical peak and among the highest in its specific industry.A company's annual pretax margin can be found in the Stock Checkup feature at Investors.com and in charts accompanying the IBD 50, the Sector Leaders, IPO Leaders and Income Investor columns.A pair of other measures give an indication of a company's strength.IBD's SMR Rating combines a company's sales, profit margins and return on equity into a single indicator. Stocks are ranked on a scale of A to E, with A being highest. Investors should look for those rated A or B.The stocks in the table accompanying this story were taken from a recent IBD 50 list. All show strong annual pretax margin in the prior fiscal year.

1337,SWKS,"ETFs that track the iconic S&P 500 index can produce very different results. They may approach that benchmark's investment universe from distinct angles. Most give investors plain-vanilla broad exposure to the U.S. stock market.
"
1338,SWKS,"Others offer less volatility than a traditional stock portfolio. Or they overweight stocks that outperform in certain market conditions.
"
1339,SWKS,"These three S&P 500 exchange traded funds exemplify those differences:
"
1340,SWKS,"For most ETF investors, the mighty $174.28 billion SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) represents both the broad market and the benchmark against which they compare the performance of other investments. SPY has a simple goal — diversified, efficient exposure to roughly 500 U.S. large-cap and some midcap stocks.
"
1341,SWKS,"A market-cap-weighted ETF, it gives a bigger weighting to larger stocks. Big price changes in these holdings can have a dramatic impact on the value of a cap-weighted ETF.
"
1342,SWKS,"Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) are its top three holdings, weighing in at about 4% for Apple and 2% for the other two. More recent additions include IBD Leaderboard stocks Mallinckrodt (MNK), Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS).
"
1343,SWKS,"SPY has a 0.09% expense ratio, or $9 in fees for every $10,000 invested. It's up 3% in 2015 and produced an average annual gain of 20.4% in the past three years.
"
1344,SWKS,"The $11.41 billion Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight (RSP) owns all the stocks in the S&P 500, but gives greater weight to smaller stocks. A smart beta ETF, it follows an equal-weighted index. This method gives each stock more or less the same portfolio weighting. Apple, with a market cap of $742.5 billion, gets a 0.2% stake in RSP. So does IBD 50 stock United Health Services (UHS), whose market cap is $12.6 billion.
"
1345,SWKS,"In SPY, United Health has a 0.06% weight.
"
1346,SWKS,"RSP has a 0.4% expense ratio. It has gained 2% year to date and averaged an annual 22.5% advance in the past three years.
"
1347,SWKS,"Its returns also beat SPY's in the past five- and 10-year periods. Its stock market gains were helped in part by the skew towards smaller stocks in the underlying index. These companies tend to outperform when the market's in a strong uptrend.
"
1348,SWKS,"PowerShares S&P Low Volatility (SPLV) is also a smart beta ETF. It selects the 100 S&P 500 stocks with the lowest volatility and gives bigger weightings to those that are less volatile. But those differences are relatively small.
"
1349,SWKS,"Stericycle (SRCL), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Allstate (ALL) are its top three holdings. They get a 1.2% portfolio weighting. The stocks with the smallest weightings get 0.9%.
"
1350,SWKS,"SPLV has a 0.25% expense ratio. Low volatility ETFs can lag in bull markets. SPLV has fallen 1.4% in 2015 and gained an average 15.3% in the past three years.
"
1351,SWKS,"But this low-vol ETF should hold up better than its S&P 500 peers if the market trends down and in the long term, experts say. It does not have a five-year return history.

1753,SWKS,"SanDisk (SNDK) early Thursday lowered its Q1 revenue guidance, prompting at least one analyst to downgrade the stock. The Milpitas, Calif.-based flash-memory chipmaker revised its Q1 revenue outlook to $1.3 billion, down 13% from the year-earlier quarter and below its prior guidance of $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had modeled on $1.42 billion. Before SanDisk announced Q4 earnings in January, analysts had forecast $1.56 billion in Q1 revenue.SanDisk in a brief press release cited ""certain product qualification delays, lower-than-expected sales of enterprise products and lower pricing in some areas of the business.""SanDisk says that it expects continued impact to its 2015 financial results from these factors, and it now forecasts 2015 revenue to be lower than its previous guidance. The company withdrew other forecasts for the quarter and year, and said that it will reschedule its investor day, which had been set for May.The move Thursday follows an earlier one in January, when SanDisk lowered its Q4 revenue guidance, citing softer-than-expected sales of retail products and flash-drive memory chips. At the time, SanDisk said that it had lost ""a large customer,"" which analysts said likely was Apple (AAPL).SanDisk stock was down more than 16% in midday trading in the stock market today, hitting a 15-month low near 67.

""We believe our growth prospects remain strong, and we are encouraged by the progress we are making in our 3D Nand technology.""Memory chipmaker and rival Micron Technology (MU), which is slated to report February-quarter earnings on April 2, was up more than 1.5% in midday trading Thursday despite SanDisk's warning.IBD's 42-company Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing group was down nearly 3% after falling nearly 5% on Wednesday but still ranks No. 2 out of 197 groups tracked.

All three share a highest-possible 99 Composite Rating and are in various stages of stock price action.Qorvo may be working on a cup-shaped base with a potential buy point at 78.15. It's in the sixth week of its current consolidation, a stage three pattern, which kicked off following a 50% run-up from a flat-base breakout in late October.The maker of chips used in mobile devices, wireless networks and metering devices has scored triple-digit or higher profit growth the past nine quarters, after seven straight quarters of declines. Qorvo said last week it's expanding its product for China and other developing markets.Skyworks is trading at record highs and is overextended past its last breakout as well as subsequent rebounds off its 10-week moving average. There's no current buy point, but staying alert for a new base would be prudent.Skyworks' chips enable wireless connectivity in smartphones, tablets and other devices. Profit and sales growth accelerated the past four quarters. Canaccord Genuity on Monday lifted its price target to 102 from 90, citing the chipmaker's grip on the mobile market.Taiwan Semiconductor gapped down and fell nearly 3% in fast trade before finding support at its 50-day moving average. Shares have almost given up an 11% gain from a mid-January breakout from a double-bottom base, but remain almost 3% above a 22.84 entry. Pacific Crest Securities on Monday downgraded the stock to underperform from sector perform, citing a potential loss of some of its Apple (AAPL) business.

1813,SWKS,"Avago Technologies (AVGO) hit a new high and received several price target increases Thursday after reporting better-than-expected fiscal Q1 earnings and guidance, driven by Apple iPhone and enterprise storage demand.After the market close Wednesday, the Singapore-based wireless chipmaker also announced plans to acquire networking company Emulex (ELX) for $606 million, or $8 a share. It expects the deal to close before November.""In our view, Emulex, which provides fiber channel connectivity, should complement Avago's enterprise storage and optical segments well,"" Pacific Crest Securities analyst John Vinh said in a research report Thursday.Vinh, who raised his price target for Avago stock to 135 from 115, said, ""Emulex is another accretive gem and extends the runway for our bull case.""Avago was up 14% in midday trading in the stock market today, near 128 and at a record high for the fifth straight trading day. The Leaderboard stock is extended from a 104.27 four-weeks-tight buy point and from a pullback to the 50-day line.Emulex stock shot up 25% in midday trading Thursday, near 8.Apple chip suppliers Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) both were up 1% in midday trading Thursday.Avago late Wednesday reported its biggest year-over-year earnings and revenue growth in more than four years, as wireless sales surged in its fiscal Q1 ended Feb. 1.Avago, which supplies radio-frequency chips for Apple (AAPL) iPhones, also guided Q2 revenue above Wall Street forecasts and said Emulex would immediately add to earnings once the acquisition closes.Avago's Q1 marked the seventh straight quarter of accelerating sales and earnings growth, which analysts say has been driven by strong demand for better and faster smartphones, particularly in China. The seven-quarter run includes six straight quarters of double-digit or better gains on the top and bottom lines.Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley boosted his target price on Avago stock to 145 from 125, noting in a research report Thursday that Avago is ""well positioned for solid long-term growth led by its wireless business.""We believe Avago's industry-leading FBAR (film bulk acoustic resonator) filter portfolio, strong position and our expectations for increasing radio-frequency dollar content in Apple and Samsung's net-generation flagship smartphones, and growing sales to the China LTE smartphone original equipment manufacturer base position the company to benefit from strong secular radio-frequency total addressable market growth trends through 2016,"" Walkley said.The company's FBAR filters are designed to minimize interference in cellular, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices.Avago's wireless segment accounted for 40% of total revenue in Q1 and jumped 90% from the year-earlier quarter, the company reported.""Given this level of (wireless revenue) growth, coupled with our expectation for additional FBAR filter content in upcoming smartphone generations, we expect to remain capacity constrained through the balance of this year even as we continue to grow our FBAR capacity over the next 12 months,"" CEO Hock Tan said in a conference call with analysts Wednesday.RELATED:Google Android Remains King Of The Smartphone Hill.

"
1842,SWKS,"Apple investors looking for the next big catalyst for the consumer electronics company have turned their attention to the upcoming Apple Watch launch in April.
"
1843,SWKS,"Apple (AAPL) introduced the smartwatch at a media event on Sept. 9. The wrist-worn device will come in standard, sport and luxury styles and will offer 1.5- and 1.65-inch screens, plus a variety of wristbands. Prices will start at $349.Many details have yet to be disclosed about the Apple Watch, including prices for the entire lineup of devices and accessories. Battery life for the watch is an issue as well.Consumer demand for the new smartwatch is also a big question mark. Surveys to date have shown only modest interest in the Apple Watch among smartphone owners.Apple CEO Tim Cook wore an Apple Watch to the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference in San Francisco on Tuesday. He sang its praises when asked about it in an on-stage interview.Other companies have come out with smartwatches, but Apple will be the one that gets it right, just as it did with the iPod for MP3 players and iPad for the tablets, Cook says.What's On 'Apple Watch' List?Apple hopes that the Apple Watch will change people's lives for the better, whether by encouraging them to be more physically active or by discouraging them from checking their smartphones for information all the time.""People will be surprised by the breadth of what it will do,"" Cook said. ""Everyone is going to have their favorite thing, just like when the App Store came out. You remember the tagline 'There's an app for that' and the way you felt about your favorite app. You're going to have a feeling like that.""The Apple Watch looks ""fantastic"" and is more than a timepiece, he said. It can provide subtle notifications to your wrist, such as updating you on sports scores and financial markets, and it can track your health and fitness data.Cook says that he uses the Apple Watch in the gym to track his activity level and exercise data. In the office, it taps his wrist if he is sitting too long, to remind him to get up and move. ""A lot of doctors believe that sitting is the new cancer,"" he said. ""Activity is good for all of us.""He also uses the Siri voice-response personal assistant app, built into the Apple Watch. ""I constantly use Siri with my watch and ask different things,"" he said.""There's an enormous number of things that it can do,"" Cook said. ""You're going to think, 'Wow, I can't live without this.'""He added that he's ""super excited"" about the third-party apps in development for the Apple Watch.Consumer polls measuring purchase intent for the Apple Watch are pretty much meaningless at this point, Hudson Square Research analyst Daniel Ernst tells IBD. As Apple co-founder Steve Jobs used to say, people don't know what they want until you show it to them, Ernst says.Among 500 million-plus Apple users, ""there's going to be enough willing to give it a whirl without it even becoming a mainstream product,"" he said. ""It will do well.""Production is apt to be limited at first as Apple gauges demand and ramps up production, he says.Morningstar analyst Brian Colello says that the monster success of the new iPhone 6 series phones, which debuted last September, demonstrates that Apple's brand is very strong. That strength should help the Apple Watch, he says.""It bodes well for the possibility that customers will buy the next Apple gadget, perhaps independent of price and features,"" Colello said. The Apple Watch could ""ride the coattails"" of the iPhone, he said.Macs, iPhones, iPads Sell WellWhile the Apple Watch is the company's next big thing, the outlook for its current product categories is upbeat, Cook says.Mac computer sales are up, while the rest of the PC industry is in decline. The iPhone 6 upgrade cycle is poised to continue this year after a record December quarter. The company's partnership with IBM (IBM) is aimed at increasing iPad usage in corporations and other large enterprises. And the Apple Pay contactless payment service is seeing faster-than-expected adoption, Cook says.Plus, Apple is setting the stage for future growth with software innovations rolled out last year, Cook says. They include its Swift programming language, HealthKit for correlating and sharing health and fitness information, HomeKit for controlling your home with Siri, and CarPlay to extend iOS into your car. ""That is huge for our future. It's not every day you can plant that many foundational technologies,"" he said.But the iPhone is the product currently driving Apple's business.In the December quarter, Apple's Q1, the iPhone accounted for 69% of total sales. Huge demand for the bigger-screen iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus fueled a surge in sales. Apple sold 74.5 million iPhones in fiscal Q1, up 46% vs. a year earlier.Apple's total sales rose 30% year over year to $74.6 billion. It was the third straight quarter of accelerating revenue growth.Earnings per share at Apple have grown even faster than sales, thanks to aggressive share buybacks and sales of higher-margin iPhone 6 series phones. EPS grew 48% year over year in fiscal Q1, marking the fifth straight quarter of growth that was equal to or higher than the quarter before.Apple investors have applauded the company's recent performance, driving the stock price to all-time highs this week.""Tech stocks are ultimately about growth,"" analyst Ernst said. ""In 2013 their earnings declined 10%, but in the year before that they rose 60%. There was a lot of prognostication during that time and a lot of theories and big-picture thinking about (Apple's future). But at the end of the day, the one reason why Apple stock fell (in 2013) was because earnings declined.""In fiscal 2014, ended in September, Apple's earnings rose 14%. In Q1 fiscal 2015, earnings skyrocketed. So it's no surprise that Apple's stock price is up as well, he says.A rising Apple has floated the boats of many of its component suppliers.

"
1878,SWKS,"No single stock screen will be the best in every uptrend. Different uptrends reward different kinds of stocks, and the screens reflect that reality. For example, during the last bear market, the aggressive and growthy complexion of the IBD 50 (then the IBD 100) faded.Stocks making the list on Oct. 27, 2008, included El Paso Electric (EE), Campbell Soup (CPB), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).The mention of those equities alone said, ""It's a bear market.""As of early November, the 85-85 screen has been the top-performing screen over the past six months. The 85-85 was up 6.1%, while the S&P 500 gained 1.1% and the IBD 50 1.5%.What can be made of this? There are two ways to use a screen — the micro approach and the macro approach.The micro approach studies the list to find stocks that might be near buy points and that have few misses by CAN SLIM standards .The macro approach looks for patterns in the list. What kind of stocks are making the list — small caps or big caps? Which sectors or industry groups are plentiful? Are the stocks making the screen aggressive or defensive?Let's contemplate two screens — the IBD 50 and the 85-85, also known as Your Weekly Review in Friday's newspaper.Generally, the IBD 50 is a collection of stocks that have higher ratings than those in the 85-85 screen. Because the IBD 50 has higher ratings, these stocks should do better in a long and strong uptrend.Quality growth stocks, though, will likely correct more sharply than defensive stocks when the market runs into trouble.What is the advantage of the 85-85 screen?The 85-85 will pick up more turnaround stocks than the IBD 50. (A turnaround stock is less likely to have strong annual ratings over the past three years.) The 85-85's looser standard means that it's also more likely to pick up stocks benefiting from sector rotation. It also will pick up more small and thinly traded stocks than the IBD 50.The sector rotation angle has been apparent recently. Small bank and S&L industry groups accounted for 40 of the stocks in the 85-85 at the end of October.Yet only two bank stocks made the IBD 50 — Bank of the Ozarks (OZRK) and Signature Bank (SBNY). Many of the 85-85 bank stocks are thinly traded. Some, though, still attract quality mutual fund holders, as the table shows.

1880,SWKS,"Qorvo CEO Bob Bruggeworth is leading a new management team working to integrate two chipmakers' products and cultures, leverage their combined strengths and define long-term technology and product road maps.He'll draw on 31 years of experience to accomplish the challenge.The name Qorvo (QRVO) might not ring a bell. RF Micro Devices, also called RFMD, agreed in February 2014 to acquire TriQuint Semiconductor for about $1.6 billion.The deal, billed as a merger of equals, culminated a five-year courtship. The pair officially merged as of Jan. 1 under the new name.Qorvo battles Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Avago Technologies (AVGO) among the top radio-frequency chip suppliers.Bruggeworth first delved into semiconductors while building transistors in college.""Most of my classes were taught by professors who worked at an RCA fab,"" Bruggeworth said.He started his career in 1983 at Santa Ana, Calif.-based Accelerated Memory Production, or AMP, where he began working on sockets for integrated circuits.""Before I left AMP to join RF Micro Devices in 1999, I was responsible for AMP's global computer and consumer electronics business based in Hong Kong,"" he said. He moved to RF Micro for ""the opportunity to move from wired to wireless technologies.""In June 2002, Bruggeworth was named president of RF Micro Devices. Seven months later, he added the CEO title.Bruggeworth recently spoke with IBD about Qorvo, which is set to release Q4 earnings after the close Wednesday.IBD: What's the merger's goal?Bruggeworth: We see the merger creating a new leader in RF (radio-frequency chip) solutions. Qorvo is highly diversified, with greater than $2 billion in annualized revenue and expertise in mobile devices, complex infrastructure and global defense applications. These are robust markets with strong long-term prospects, and we have a goal of outpacing our markets' underlying growth rates of approximately 10% to 15%. We've assembled a world-class team with a legacy of innovation and a sharp focus on superior financial results, and we believe we can achieve our target operating model of 50% gross margin and 30% operating margin within two years while posting above-market growth.IBD: Why the name Qorvo?Bruggeworth: Since this was a merger of equals, we wanted to create a new name for the company. Qorvo (pronounced ""kor-vo"") isn't a name that existed before, so we have an opportunity to create a new brand from a clean sheet of paper.The name combines the words ""core"" and ""voyage."" Qorvo delivers the core technologies so that our customers can launch their next-generation designs faster. The second part of the name, ""vo"" for ""voyage,"" evokes moving through air or space.IBD: How do the two companies' technologies and products complement one another?Bruggeworth: RFMD and TriQuint served many of the same markets and had developed some very complementary technologies. We have core strengths in system design, semiconductor processing, advanced packaging, high-volume manufacturing and strategic foundry services, and we are capable of serving both high-volume commercial and defense customers.That said, there was surprisingly little overlap in our product portfolios. So as Qorvo, we can combine our many strengths — in areas like premium filters, switches, antenna tuners, power amplifiers and power management — to offer our customers RF solutions that are much more highly integrated and much more valuable.IBD: Will the companies have one headquarters at RF Micro's home base in Greensboro, N.C.?Bruggeworth: Qorvo will have dual headquarters in Greensboro and (TriQuint's home base) Hillsboro, Ore. We're a global company with dozens of locations and thousands of customers around the world. Our leadership team is distributed across Greensboro and Hillsboro, as well as in other locations globally, and we use technologies like TelePresence videoconferencing to help bridge time and distance, and create a sense of being in one location.IBD: What is your goal in cost savings?Bruggeworth: We are committed to $150 million in cost synergies within two years of the merger; $75 million in annualized synergies exiting the first year after closing; and an additional $75 million exiting the second year.IBD: What are market trends and your revenue drivers looking like?Bruggeworth: The underlying trends in the markets we serve — mobile, infrastructure and defense — are positive, particularly in the applications we make possible. The demand for mobile data is growing, and Qorvo is very well positioned with the core technologies necessary to help our customers accelerate their products to market.Whether you're talking about mobile devices, radar/avionics systems or communication infrastructure like base stations, point-to-point radio links or optical and cable networks, Qorvo is helping to connect people, networks and things, both wirelessly and over wired networks.IBD: As smartphones become more complex, is more RF content needed? Premium filters, switches and modules?Bruggeworth: Yes. Half of the world's handsets shipping today are 2G and average significantly less than $1 of RF content. With the increasing global demand for mobile data and the migration to 4G, that's increasing to significant dollars of RF content per device over a multiyear period.Consumers in all geographies want their mobile devices to deliver longer battery life, broader coverage, increased throughput, greater functionality and overall improved performance.To achieve this, smartphone manufacturers are adding new LTE bands to their devices, and the cellular industry is supporting new technologies, like envelope tracking, carrier aggregation and, later, transmit MIMO (multiple input multiple output, an antenna technology for wireless communications in which multiple antennas are used at both the source \ and the destination \) to enrich the user experience.For Qorvo, that's driving incremental demand for our RF content, primarily premium filters, switches and tuners, as well as our power amplifiers.

1887,SWKS,"Connected cars are cruising forward, with implications for the stocks of companies supplying the technology. They're just one aspect of the so-called Internet of Things being built out, where it's gizmos communicating instead of people.By 2020, one in five vehicles on the road — about 250 million — will have a wireless network connection, Gartner predicted Tuesday. The buildout of connected cars will enable new in-vehicle services and automated driving capabilities, the research firm says.A few companies working on such car-tech are recent IPO Mobileye (MBLY), which makes advanced driver assistance systems on the way to self-driving cars; chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), on a similar path and also with a stake in advanced display technology; NXP Semiconductors (NXPI); and car-camera technology provider Ambarella, among others.The increasing connectedness of cars creates ""opportunities or makers of application processors, graphic accelerators, displays and human-machine interface technologies,"" Gartner research director James Hines said in the study release.Beyond just cars, Gartner predicts 4.9 billion connected things will be in use this year, up 20% from last year, and headed for 25 billion by 2020. These could be anything from cameras to refrigerators.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brad Erickson sees three focus names to do with the Internet of Things: recent IPO and action-camera maker GoPro (GPRO), chipmaker Ambarella (AMBA) and electric-car maker Tesla Motors (TSLA). Looking at their next earnings reports, Erickson expects GoPro to slightly beat expectations and raise guidance, and for Ambarella to beat and raise, while he sees Tesla in line with results and guidance.Erickson says optimism around the nouveau Internet of Things has moderated relative to last year, but there's value to be ""squeezed"" out of every vertical market over time.""Enablers of connectivity benefiting already to varying degrees,"" he said in a research note, include carriers and ""component vendors like AMBA, SLAB, SWKS, NXPI, MXIM.""Of all these names, the ones highest ranked by IBD are Ambarella, NXP and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), each of which get a highest-possible 99 Composite Rating from IBD, followed by Nvidia with a 95 and GoPro with a 92. The lowest is Tesla, with just a 24 Composite Rating, after a 344% stock runup in 2013 and 48% in 2014.Of the highest-rated names, those recently making some tracks in the stock market include Skyworks, Nvidia, NXP and Ambarella.RELATED:Skyworks, NXP, Avago Have Been Hot Chip Stocks.

1914,SWKS,"A more than $40 billion merger plan announced over the weekend begins to build what one analyst calls an ""automotive powerhouse.""
"
1915,SWKS,"IBD Leaderboard company NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), a connected-car chipmaker and also a supplier of some chip technology in Apple (AAPL) iPhones, said it will merge with Freescale Semiconductor (FSL) to establish the No. 1 automotive semiconductor supplier as well as the market leader in general purpose microcontroller products, or MCUs.
"
1916,SWKS,"NXP shares rose 17.3% to 99.56 on the stock market today, hitting a new all-time high. Freescale shares climbed 11.8% to 40.36.
"
1917,SWKS,"The deal, expected to close in the second half of the year, is one of several chipmaker mergers recently. The combination of NXP and Freescale gives depth and breadth of product offerings to industries — automakers and smartphone suppliers, for example — that routinely use chips from many makers but could benefit from consolidation.
"
1918,SWKS,"NXP says Freescale shareholders will get $6.25 in cash and 0.3521 of an NXP share for each Freescale share, which values Freescale equity at $11.8 billion based on NXP's Friday closing price, and puts total enterprise value at $16.7 billion including Freescale's net debt.
"
1919,SWKS,"At Monday's close, the deal valued Freescale stock at $41.31.
"
1920,SWKS,"Netherlands-based NXP does about $5.7 billion in annual sales to Austin, Texas-based Freescale's $4.6 billion. NXP has a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99 and Freescale an 88.
"
1921,SWKS,"RBC Capital Markets analyst Doug Freedman said in a Sunday research note that $200 million in annual synergies are expected to grow to $500 million, and that ""the synergies appear completely respectable and achievable.""
"
1922,SWKS,"""Automotive powerhouse being built, opportunity for higher margins ahead,"" he wrote, noting that the transaction is expected to add to NXP's non-GAAP earnings and free cash flow.
"
1923,SWKS,"The announcement ""is a transformative step in our objective to become the industry leader in high performance mixed signal solutions,"" NXP CEO Richard Clemmer said in the merger announcement. ""We fully expect to continue to significantly out-grow the overall market, drive world-class profitability and generate even more cash, which taken together will maximize value for both Freescale and NXP shareholders.""
"
1924,SWKS,"Along with serving many other industries and companies, could the combined NXP and Freescale figure bigger as a supplier to Apple, which at last check had a gigantic market cap of $748 billion?
"
1925,SWKS,"With Apple working on the Apple Watch and rumored to be possibly working on an Apple car, there are several ways in which the merged NXP-and-Freescale company's products could be of use. NXP's investor presentation on the merger notes that the combined company will be working in the areas of connected cars, security, portables and wearables (where it shows the image of a watch), and the Internet of Things.
"
1926,SWKS,"Freescale works in a host of areas, and among its interesting roles in the car industry are development of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), a step on the way to self-driving cars, and motor controls for both conventional and electric vehicles.
"
1927,SWKS,"Analysts have recently commented on what Apple might want to do in the car realm. It already makes CarPlay, a standard that lets its devices work with the built-in displays on car dashboards.
"
1928,SWKS,"""AAPL may not be interested in building whole vehicles,"" Stifel Nicolaus analyst James Albertine wrote recently in a research note on Tesla Motors (TSLA), ""but rather trying to strengthen its position in the battle for the 'center-stack' (where car infotainment solutions and connectivity reside).""
"
1929,SWKS,"NXP notes leadership positions in car entertainment, in-vehicle networking and powertrain among other features of the combined company's standing as the top auto semiconductor vendor by sales.
"
1930,SWKS,"Among other high-rated connected-car tech companies is Ambarella (AMBA), which makes chips for cameras used in many industries, including next-generation 360-degree car safety cameras. It is slated to report quarterly earnings on Tuesday after the stock market close.

2043,SWKS,"Stocks powered out of the starting gate Wednesday as mixed economic news took a back seat to optimism over potential developments in the eurozone.The Dow Jones Industrial average and the Nasdaq were up 0.9% each. The S&P 500 climbed 0.8%.Volume rose, up about 5% each on the Nasdaq and NYSE exchanges.The stock market today continued to carefully watch the ongoing Greece/eurozone crisis. A letter from Greek leaders Tuesday night conceded to more of the creditors' austerity demands than before, but requested an extension for the now-expired bailout support and additional funds. Reuters reported that German officials were skeptical of the proposal, but said the ""door was still open for negotiations.""Early U.S. economic news was mixed, with new jobs and layoffs increasing in June.June manufacturing softened. The Purchasing Managers Index eased to 53.6, down from 54 in May and a tad shy of views for 53.7.The ISM Index from the Institute of Supply Management was more positive, rising to 53.3. That was above May's 52.8 tally and narrowly above consensus estimates for 53.2.Construction spending slowed sharply in May, the Commerce Department said, rising 0.8% vs. April's downwardly revised 2.1% increase. Still, the number was better than the 0.5% increase forecast by economists.Among automakers reporting June sales, Nissan Motor (NSANY) led with a 13.3% increase. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) reported an 8.2% gain for the month. Ford (F) sales gained 1.6%. General Motors (GM) sales fell 3%.In stocks, insurer Travelers (TRV) popped 3.6% to lead the Dow. The stock was possibly boosted by this morning's news that Switzerland-based Ace (ACE) would buy New Jersey-based insurer Chubb (CB) in a deal valued at $28.3 billion. Chubb shares spiked 33% at the open. Ace climbed 7%.On the Nasdaq 100, Wynn Resorts (WYNN) spiked 7%, stretching its legs for a second day after regulators in China eased travel restrictions for visitors from mainland China to Macau, where Wynn and competitors operate a hive of casinos. Wynn has been in a correction for 15 months.Among IBD 50 stocks,France's Criteo (CRTO) sparked up 5% out of the starting gate. The move lifted the stock out of buying range, 7% above a 46.60 buy point.Epam Systems (EPAM) leapt nearly 4%, moving to the top of buying range — almost 5% past a 70.59 buy point.Among the group's few early declines, Taser International (TASR) slipped a bit less than 2%. The stock remained just above its 50-day moving average after retaking that support in light trade Tuesday.

2045,SWKS,"With the market in a confirmed uptrend, most stocks should advance. But investors should look for the true market leaders, such as Skyworks Solutions (SWKS).IBD's Screen of the Day, Bolting RS Lines, separates the wheat from the chaff. It focuses on top-rated companies whose relative strength lines are rising to new highs. A rising RS line means the stock is outpacing the benchmark S&P; 500 index.Skyworks has advanced for the past six sessions, rising 2% Monday to a new closing high of 82.48 on the stock market today. Even more impressive, Skyworks has reported nine straight quarters of accelerating earnings per share growth, including last week's Q1 2015 gain of 88%. Sales growth has picked up for four straight quarters.Skyworks shares have been on a tear since finding support just above its 200-day moving average on Oct. 10. Its RS line has been hitting new highs since early November.Skyworks makes radio frequency chips used in the Apple (AAPL) iPhone 6, Samsung Galaxy GS5 as well as many other wireless devices and in other industries. Apple reports earnings Tuesday night, with analysts raising iPhone 6 sales targets.Centene (CNC) is a leading health insurer, focusing on Medicaid programs. It's benefited from the ObamaCare Medicaid expansion as well as winning more state Medicaid contracts.Centene said Monday it will buy Oregon-based Agate Resources , which provides some Medicaid, Medicare Advantage and ObamaCare exchange coverage in the state.Q4 earnings likely doubled (101%) in Centene's next report due in early February, accelerating from the prior quarter's 37% advance. Centene shares cleared a short consolidation base last week, hitting a record intraday high on Friday. Its RS line hit a new high ahead of the stock, a bullish sign.Shares rose 1.2% to 111.80 on Monday, a new closing high.Several other health insurers are on the Bolting RS Lines screen — though not in the top 5 — including UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Cigna (CI). UnitedHealth earnings beat estimates last week as medical costs remained tame.Next on the Bolting RS Lines' top 5 is Qorvo (QRVO), another RF chipmaker. The name may not be familiar, but it's forged from the recent merger of RF Micro Devices and Triquint Semiconductor. The Apple iPhone 6 also boasts Qorvo chips. Qorvo rose to a new high Friday after clearing a 3-week consolidation following a rapid ascent. Qorvo stock fell a fraction Monday.Rounding out the top five are Electronic Arts (EA) and Alaska Air Group (ALK). Alaska is one of three airline stocks on the Bolting RS Lines screen, along with Southwest Airlines (LUV) and Delta Air Lines (DAL).Follow Ed Carson on Twitter: @IBD_ECarson.

2233,SWKS,"Skyworks Solutions late Thursday reported fiscal Q4 sales and earnings that handily beat Wall Street estimates, as did the company's outlook for the current quarter.Investors, however, apparently wanted more upside from the Apple (AAPL) supplier, as Skyworks (SWKS) stock was flat in after-hours trading, after the company released results for the quarter ended Oct. 3.Skyworks said that its Q4 revenue jumped 51% from the year-earlier quarter to $718 million — its biggest sales gain in at least 18 quarters.Skyworks is widely believed to be a supplier of radio-frequency chips for Apple iPhones and iPads. Other customers include action-camera maker GoPro (GPRO).Q4 earnings per share excluding items were $1.12, up 75%, for the eighth consecutive quarter of rising year-over-year EPS gains.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected $682 million in revenue and EPS of $1.08.The Woburn, Mass.-based company said that it expects revenue to climb 52% in the December quarter to $770 million, with EPS ex items to rise 76% to $1.18.Analysts had been expecting EPS of $1.08 on sales of $718 million.For the fiscal year, Skyworks' revenue rose 28% to $2.3 billion and EPS ex items rose 47% to $3.24.$3 Billion Run-Rate""We are now scaling to more than a $3 billion revenue run-rate with annualized non-GAAP earnings per share approaching $5,"" company CFO Donald Palette said in a statement.Skyworks' better-than-expected outlook comes as a result of its ""strong leverage to the tier-1 handset OEMs and emerging market 4G rollout, end-market diversification, operational excellence, high-performance analog design wins, solid cash generation and relative valuation,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Thomas Diffely told IBD.In Q4, Skyworks showed its diversity by providing chips for a wide range of clients and uses. It provided chips for General Motors (GM) collision-avoidance systems and for GPS applications to support avionics for Rockwell Collins (COL). Its chips were in thermostat and lighting platforms made by General Electric (GE) and video cameras from recent hot IPO GoPro.Skyworks is among several radio-frequency chipmakers that analysts say are well-positioned as suppliers for Apple iPhones and iPads. Others include two firms that are merging, RF Micro Devices (RFMD) and TriQuint Semiconductor (TQNT).""We are enabling the global adoption of connectivity in all its forms and across all applications and end markets,"" Skyworks CEO David Aldrich said on the company's earnings conference call with analysts.""This powerful and secular megatrend is in the early innings and is spanning diverse markets like mobile, the connected home, media, security, computing, enterprise and networking across a number of communications protocols. These include 4G, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, ZigBee and others,"" Aldrich said.Growing DemandSkyworks is benefiting from the growing need for complex analog chips that can handle higher data-rate connectivity standards in smartphones from Apple, Samsung and others. Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley says that Skyworks increased its dollar content share by more than 10% in the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus compared with the iPhone 5s/5c models. He added that the company remains ""a key leading RF supplier to Apple.""Skyworks is also tapping into the Internet of Things trend, where household appliances, cars and other items are wirelessly connected to the Internet. Skyworks said that it expanded its chip designs for wearables in Q4, including three new smartwatch programs, though it didn't identify the smartwatch makers.The company's chips enable control systems inside cars that allow drivers to activate garage door openers, entry door locks, home lighting and security systems remotely. The global connected car market Transparency Market Research is expected to reach $131.9 billion by 2019, growing at a compound annual growth rate near 35%, as was reported in October.Skyworks is seeing new opportunities for its connectivity chips due to the rise in popularity of streaming music and video, mobile payment systems and cloud-based applications. Skyworks says that its chips will be used in wireless audio speakers from Bose and Sonos, for streaming music and for video networks.Skyworks stock rose 2.1% in Thursday's regular session to 62.14, a more than 14-year high for the fourth consecutive day.

2251,SWKS,"Chip leader Intel's (INTC) Q3 earnings beat late Tuesday and an upbeat outlook for the current quarter helped allay fears of a broad industry slowdown.But Intel stock fell Wednesday on a rough day for the stock market, as weaker-than-forecast economic data added to concerns about slowing economic growth.Intel stock was down 4.5% in midday trading in the stock market today, near 30.50.Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore downgraded Intel stock to underweight, saying in a research note that ""the disparity between Intel's unit shipments vs. demand is unsustainable at best, or signaling inventory build at worst. ... We see limited upside.""But at least four investment banks hiked their price targets on Intel stock.Intel's report was ""just what the doctor ordered to mend broken chip stocks,"" Srini Sundararajan, an analyst with Summit Research Partners, said in a research note.""Intel made clear that they did not see any one-off China-related 'October surprise' of the sort (CEO) Steve Sanghi from Microchip Tech (MCHP) shocked the market with last Friday,"" Sundararajan said.Microchip warned last week that ""another industry correction has begun"" and lowered its revenue estimates. The remarks sparked a sell-off of chip stocks Friday.But Intel CFO Stacy Smith said in a conference call with analysts that Intel wasn't seeing any kind of broad slowdown in the chip market.""On the supply chain and seasonality for Q4, what I'd say is there is an appropriate amount of inventory in anticipation of a seasonal Q4,"" Smith said. ""We're guiding 1% up; if you take midpoint of our guidance, that's kind of the seasonality we've seen over the last several years.""Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) on Tuesday raised its guidance for the September quarter. Analysts attributed Skyworks' guidance to strong demand for Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 6 and to the build-out of broadband wireless LTE connections in China.Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said on the call that overall business was strong. The PC Client Group saw sales increase 9% from the year-earlier quarter to $9.2 billion. Sales for the Data Center Group, consisting of server chips and more, rose 16% to $3.7 billion.Intel's Q3 results were driven by ""continued strength in enterprise-focused PCs and strong year-over-year growth in multiple data center segments — even 10%-plus core enterprise growth for the second consecutive quarter where recent growth has disappointed,"" Matthew Ramsay, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity, said in a research report Wednesday.Intel's revenue guidance for the current quarter of $14.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million, beat views.Revenue in Intel's Mobile and Communications Group, however, fell to $1 million from $51 million the previous quarter and $353 million in the year-earlier quarter.Intel has set a goal of putting more of its chips into tablet computers this year. But it has paid subsidies to hardware companies to use its tablet chips rather than chips based on designs from ARM Holdings (ARMH), which are the standard in many mobile devices. Intel's tablet initiative has increased costs, resulting in a $1.04 billion operating loss for its Mobile and Communications Group.Stephen Chin, an analyst with UBS Securities, said in a research report Wednesday that Intel's ""contra revenue"" strategy, or essentially paying tablet makers to use its chips, is showing signs of improving returns on its investment. He estimates Intel's mobile segment would have generated $300 million to $350 million in revenue in the quarter.""We expect the trajectory of MCG margins in 2015 to be a key focus of the analyst meeting on Nov. 19,"" he wrote.Chin sees Intel shipping 10 million to 12 million (tablet processors) in Q4, ending the year at 40 million to 45 million and in line with its initial target.Intel's Internet of Things business saw sales rise 14% year-over-year to $530 million.Intel also maintained its outlook for capital spending for the full year of $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion.RELATED:Skyworks A Winner Inside Apple iPhone 6.

""In fact, we believe Skyworks increased its dollar content in Samsung's Galaxy S6 vs. the S5 and is well positioned to keep and potentially increase its content share in the next generation (Apple) iPhone 6S and 6S Plus models.""Matthew Ramsay, another Canaccord analyst, wrote that Cavium is in good shape in the wireless infrastructure, security and data center markets.""Long term, we anticipate continued strong sales growth for core wireless infrastructure, security, data center and server products driven by increased capital spending trends focused in areas Cavium differentiates: high-bandwidth packet processing, deep packet inspection, application-specific hardware acceleration and security,"" he wrote. ""We anticipate sustainable 20%-plus top-line growth with operating expense growth less than half of top-line growth long-term, yielding considerable leverage.""

2302,SWKS,"The tech Q1 earnings season begins Tuesday, with Wall Street cautious even though Q4 tech results easily trumped a less conservative outlook.
"
2303,SWKS,"As with Q4, concerns about the strong dollar and weakness in Europe are among the reasons 27 of the 66 tech companies in the S&P 500 issued negative guidance for the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters. Only five issued positive guidance.
"
2304,SWKS,"""Tech is less negative than the overall index, but it's still a pretty pessimistic quarter for guidance in general,"" said Gregory Harrison, an earnings analyst at Thomson Reuters.
"
2305,SWKS,"For the S&P 500 overall, there have been six negative preannouncements for every positive one. For tech, the ratio is 5 to 1. The long-term S&P 500 average is about 2.5 to 1, Harrison said.
"
2306,SWKS,"It's common for companies to give cautious guidance. Heading into Q4, the consensus estimate on S&P 500 earnings was for a 3.7% gain vs. a year earlier. But in the end, earnings jumped 7%, as 69% of companies beat views.
"
2307,SWKS,"Techs Were Q4 Standouts
"
2308,SWKS,"For S&P 500 techs, earnings ended up 18%, more than double the 8.9% estimate. A big factor was a strong, accelerating profit gain from Apple (AAPL).
"
2309,SWKS,"Thomson Reuters breaks the S&P 500 into 10 sectors. The strongest earnings growth is expected for the financial sector, with analyst estimates at 10.8% growth, followed by health care at 7.4%. Close behind are industrials and consumer discretionary. Tech is fifth, with 4.3% profit growth seen.
"
2310,SWKS,"For the S&P 500 overall, analysts expect a 2.9% fall, dragged down by the energy sector. But outside energy, profit growth likely slowed as the dollar rose sharply vs. major currencies.
"
2311,SWKS,"""In previous quarters, tech was among the leaders,"" Harrison said. ""Now, it's in the middle of the pack.""
"
2312,SWKS,"Apple And Its Suppliers Lead
"
2313,SWKS,"Among the 13 tech subsectors, the hardware, storage and peripherals industry has the strongest expected earnings growth rate, 18%. Credit Apple, which reports April 27. Apple is expected to show EPS of $2.13, up 28%, on sales of $55.7 billion, up 22%.
"
2314,SWKS,"The chip industry is another strong tech group with expected profit growth of 13%. Avago Technologies' (AVGO) EPS should soar 134%, with Skyworks Solutions' (SWKS) profit expected to fly 82%. Both are Apple suppliers.
"
2315,SWKS,"A few techs have reported March-quarter results, but the season really kicks off with Intel (INTC) after the market close Tuesday. The No. 1 chipmaker is expected to post EPS of 41 cents, up 8%. Revenue is expected to inch up 1% to $12.9 billion.
"
2316,SWKS,"Intel, long by far the largest maker of PC microprocessors, has been under pressure as Q1 PC shipments fell more than 5% vs. Q1 2014, market trackers IDC and Gartner said last week.
"
2317,SWKS,"Netflix (NFLX) and SanDisk (SNDK) report late Wednesday. A flurry of earnings reports arrives next week, starting with IBM (IBM), after the close on April 20. As a broad-based tech vendor, IBM is often a bellwether for information technology spending overall.
"
2318,SWKS,"Dollar Hits IT Spending
"
2319,SWKS,"Gartner expects global IT spending to fall 1.3% to $3.66 trillion in 2015, as the strong dollar and emerging cloud computing affect business spending worldwide. The strong dollar has hit the global IT market, Gartner said. On a constant-currency basis, IT spending is expected to rise 3.1% this year, says Gartner.
"
2320,SWKS,"""A lot of U.S. companies are concerned about going into earnings season because of the exchange rate,"" Harrison said.
"
2321,SWKS,"Earnings at IBM, which generates most of its revenue offshore, are expected to be $2.85 a share, down 19%. Revenue is expected to fall 9% to $19.86 billion.
"
2322,SWKS,"Tuesday, April 21, will see the first huge earnings day, with Yahoo (YHOO) among the techs reporting. It's part of the Internet software and services group. Average EPS growth in this group is expected to be just 3%, hurt by Yahoo. Its EPS ex items is expected to tumble 53% to 18 cents. Without Yahoo, the group has an 8.7% expected growth rate.
"
2323,SWKS,"Wednesday, April 22, has Facebook (FB), eBay (EBAY) and Google (GOOGL) on tap after the market close.
"
2324,SWKS,"Analysts expect Facebook to post EPS ex items of 40 cents, which is up 18% from Q1 2014 but would mark its slowest such growth in eight quarters. Revenue is expected to rise 42% to $3.55 billion, but that would mark the fourth straight quarter of deceleration. Facebook has warned that its expenses will keep rising as the social networking giant spends heavily to advance mobile advertising. Its total costs and expenses jumped 47% in 2014 to $7.47 billion.
"
2325,SWKS,"Google is seen posting EPS of $6.64, up 6%. Revenue is estimated at $17.6 billion, up 14%.

2472,SWKS,"How sweet is it to win a slice of the Apple iPhone 6 business?It should be like candy for analog chipmaker and IBD Leaderboard stock Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), a key supplier for the new Apple (AAPL) smartphone.The Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus use chips from Skyworks, Avago Technologies (AVGO) and other firms, according to findings from tech repair firm iFixit, which opened up iPhones bought in Melbourne, Australia.Multiple power amplifier components from Skyworks were found in the iPhone 6 teardowns, Sterne Agee analyst Vijay Rakesh told IBD.In terms of iPhone 6 component suppliers, ""big winners"" are Skyworks, Avago and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) ""with content up 30%-90% from previous iPhone 5s models,"" he said in a research note.Rakesh estimates about $4 worth of content comes from Skyworks in every new iPhone 6. The opportunity for Skyworks, he adds, depends on the number of iPhones Apple sells.He cites Apple's Sept. 22 announcement that it sold over 10 million new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models, a record, just three days after the launch Sept. 19.""Apple is always a big catalyst for all smartphone component suppliers,"" Rakesh said.Stock Amps UpSkyworks' stock on Sept. 19 notched its highest closing price since 2000, ending at 57.68 after the Apple iPhone 6 teardown news. It closed up 3.4% Wednesday to 58.84. But Skyworks powered up well before the Apple iPhone 6 debut. It has gained 106% this year.In an interview with IBD, Skyworks CEO David Aldrich would not comment on whether Skyworks is a supplier for the iPhone 6, although the iFixit teardowns found the technology inside.""I am not at liberty to comment about specific companies,"" he said. ""But Skyworks has become very successful at increasing our content with all of our smartphone customers.""Skyworks develops and manufacturers high-performance analog semiconductor products. Its portfolio includes amplifiers, attenuators, battery chargers, circulators, DC/DC converters, demodulators, detectors, diodes, directional couplers and infrastructure RF (radio frequency) subsystems.Its semiconductors enable wireless connectivity in smartphones, tablets and other devices.Leveraging core technologies, Skyworks supports automotive, broadband, wireless infrastructure, energy management, GPS, industrial, medical, military, wireless networking, smartphone and tablet applications.Skyworks has been on a roll on the financial front. It's seen double-digit sales and earnings growth in all but one of the past seven quarters. Its growth accelerated in the most recent quarter to the fastest pace since mid-2011. Earnings rose 54% to 83 cents a share. Sales climbed 35% to $587 million.Connectivity Is The KeyWhat's been fueling growth at Skyworks?""Fortunately for us, the growth is being driven from both a market and product standpoint,"" Aldrich told IBD. ""We've worked very hard over the past decade to diversify our business into a broader set of markets and to produce more products and solutions. At the core is connectivity in all its forms, whether that is through a smartphone or an automobile or the home, which is becoming increasingly connected in many ways.""He said on a July conference call for Q3 of fiscal 2014: ""Our business results are being fueled by a surge in global adoption of connectivity in all its forms across a diverse set of end markets. We are riding a wave of powerful underlying market forces, all enabled by the availability of efficient, high-performance connectivity solutions.""Among these forces, he said, are ""the enabling of billions of unconnected users with first-time Internet access in the emerging economies; advancing new forms of content delivery, such as streaming music services, on-demand media and over-the-content distribution; and supporting cloud services and mobile ecommerce.""Skyworks' technology has its largest presence in smartphones, Aldrich told IBD.In the past couple of quarters, smartphones and tablets have been big growth drivers, he adds, whether it's increasing Skyworks' content in these products by providing more complete solutions or by gaining market share.""In general, smartphones are becoming more complicated and complex,"" he said. ""They need to operate over many frequencies having more functionality.""Skyworks provides a lot of the technology that goes into the more sophisticated smartphones such as solutions that support GPS and high-resolution cameras.Another growth driver: ""Skyworks has been very successful at capturing developing economic markets like China and penetrating new regions of the world that are deploying connectivity in a big way,"" said Aldrich.He points out that Skyworks is penetrating markets outside Europe and North America, with many Chinese buying smartphones for the first time.As for the future: ""Skyworks is entering a new and exciting growth phase driven by global wireless proliferation and the Internet of Things,"" said Aldrich in a statement announcing Q3 results. ""Quite simply, we are capitalizing on the macro trend to connect virtually everyone and everything, all the time. Our high-performance analog solutions and system-level integration capabilities coupled with our operational agility and scalability are enabling us to connect the previously unconnected.""Skyworks is a part of IBD's Electronic-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group. It has the highest Composite Rating in the group, with a 99 out of a possible 99.Key customers include Cisco Systems (CSCO), General Electric (GE), Google (GOOGL), Honeywell (HON), Nokia (NOK) and Samsung Electronics.

Markets were further rattled on Jun 19, after Trump asked the United States Trade Representative to identify Chinese goods worth $200 billion for additional tariffs of 10%.This further escalated trade war fears, resulting in huge sell offs. Tech stocks have been suffering particularly as China accounts for a large portion of revenues for a number of U.S. companies.Apple Fears the Worst Bite Trump’s announcement of 25% tariffs on up to $50 billion of Chinese goods including semiconductors could make Apple, Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) one of the biggest victims of a U.S.-China trade war. Apple is the most successful U.S. tech company in China. In 2017, the iPhone maker generated approximately 20% of its revenues from China, shipping more than 41 million iPhone to China in 2017. Moreover, Apple operates its services like Apple Music and App Store in China.  A trade war could result in China banning Apple’s services, which it did in 2016 by shutting down iTunes Movies and iBooks Store. Services are becoming an integral part of Apple’s business in a slowing smartphone market. Another increasing concern is: what if China bans Apple citing concerns of national security just like the United Stated cautioned customers not to buy Chinese mobile phone maker Huawei on fears of being spied by the Chinese? This would hurt Apple’s business severely. Shares of Apple declined 1.6% on Jun 19.Chipmakers to Bear the BruntChipmakers with significant exposure to China were hit on Tuesday, following Trump’s announcement of 25% tariffs on semiconductors. Telecommunication equipment maker Lumentum Holdings Inc.’s (LITE  -  Free Report) shares tumbled 3%, while Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) plummeted 0.8%.The United States is the largest semiconductor manufacturing country, with China being its biggest market. Naturally, higher tariffs will take a toll on the revenues of these semiconductor manufacturers. Qualcomm has tie-ups with a large number of Chinese companies, including Huawei. Qorvo, Inc. (QRVO  -  Free Report) too generates its almost 60% of its revenues from China. The company’s shares tumbled 2.7% on Tuesday.Similarly, other semiconductor giants like Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (SWKS  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm too depend heavily on the Chinese market. In fact, Apple and Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) are among the top 16 U.S companies that generated a total of $105.5 billion from China in 2017. Qualcomm, Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) generated respectively 16.6%, 9.5% and 1.9% of their revenues from China. Shares of Skyworks, Intel, Broadcom and NVIDIA declined 1.6%, 0.5%, 0.7% and 1.9%, respectively, on Tuesday. NVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Bottom LineTech stocks have been driving markets for a while now. However, the U.S.-China trade spat has been rattling markets, with tech stocks, particularly semiconductors, at the helm of the carnage. Tech companies depend heavily on China, which accounts for a large portion of their revenues, and retaliatory tariffs would make things worse that they already are.  Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%. And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

2856,SWKS,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (SWKS  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 6.9% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is SWKS due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Recent EarningsSkyworks delivered second-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP earnings of $1.64 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents. The figure improved 13.1% from the year-ago quarter but declined 13.1% on a sequential basis.Revenues of $913.4 million were up 7.2% year over year but down 13.2% sequentially. The reported figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $914 million.Both earnings and revenues came ahead of management’s guidance. The better-than-expected performance was driven by worldwide demand for its wireless communications engines. The results reflected Skyworks’ growing clout in the connectivity solutions and 5G markets. Meanwhile, the company’s solutions continue to capture strategic design wins across the broad markets.Adoption of Connected Home Solutions: Key CatalystThe emergence of connected homes, autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality, wearables and network infrastructure presents significant growth opportunity for Skyworks’ connectivity solutions.In the quarter, Skyworks powered connected home and virtual assistant systems at Bosch, Amazon, GE, AT&T/DIRECTV, Netgear, Sonos and Google.Across broad markets, the company ramped Wi-Fi, fully-integrated Zigbee and Thread devices for Nest’s portfolio of video doorbells.Further, management is elated that world’s largest automotive manufacturer leveraged its connectivity solutions.Other Developments in the QuarterIn the wearables segment, Skyworks supported Forerunner fitness smartwatches for Garmin. The company also enabled Honeywell’s LTE handheld enterprise hubs. The company witnessed additional design wins for its high-speed mesh networks at Belkin.The company partnered major European network infrastructure suppliers to support small cell deployments in the quarter including Verizon, AT&T, Vodafone and T-Mobile. It furnished massive MIMO solutions to India’s largest network carrier.The company launched a new suit of network-driven solution that supports wireless 5G networks, called Sky5. Notably, Sky5 solution is a platform that deals with revolutionary 5G applications. Across high-performance computing markets, Skyworks has commenced volume production of SkyOne Ultra.The company witnessed dominant mobile customers leveraging its precision antenna tuners, DRx modules, SkyOne and SkyBlue which aided the top line.Margin DetailsNon-GAAP gross margin expanded 30 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis and contracted 70 bps sequentially to 50.7%. The year-over-year improvement can be attributed to higher revenues and unit volumes, improving operating efficiency and filter in-sourcing.Research & development (R&D) expenses, as percentage of revenues, increased 120 bps year over year and 240 bps sequentially to 11.7%.Selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expenses expanded 70 bps from the year-ago quarter and 140 bps sequentially to 4.9%.As a result, non-GAAP operating margin contracted 40 bps on a year-over-year basis and 310 bps sequentially to 36.3% in the reported quarter.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowAs of Mar 30, 2018, cash & cash equivalents were $1.88 billion, up from $1.68 billion in the previous quarter. Cash flow from operating activities was $434.2 million, up from $360.8 million in the previous quarter and $228.7 in the year-ago quarter.The company declared a cash dividend of 32 cents per share in the second quarter, payable on Jun 12, 2018. It paid dividend of $58.4 million and repurchased 1 million shares for a total of $111.7 million.GuidanceFor third-quarter fiscal 2018, revenues are projected to be in the range of $875-$900 million.Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be $1.59 per share, up 1.3% year over year and down 3% sequentially.Gross margin is expected in the range of 50.7-51%, relatively flat sequentially. Operating expenses are also projected to remain flat sequentially.ConclusionSkyworks is currently plagued by trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. government on ZTE. Management anticipates that it will hurt third-quarter revenues by $25-$30 million.Furthermore, the near-term softness witnessed across leading smart-phone customers keeps the analysts cautious. Overdependence on Apple for revenue generation continues to be a major headwind for the company. The company generates around 40% of its revenues by selling radio frequency chips, which are used in iPhone devices. Sequential decline reported in iPhone unit sales is likely to impact its performance, going forward.However, management remains optimistic on Skyworks’ expanding product portfolio and new customer wins to keep revenues churning and help its gross margins improve to achieve long-term target of 53%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been two revisions higher for the current quarter compared to seven lower. In the past month, the consensus estimate has shifted downward by 6.1% due to these changes.Skyworks Solutions, Inc. Price and Consensus Skyworks Solutions, Inc.

2858,SWKS,"Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (SWKS  -  Free Report) could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective, as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front. Recently, the 50 Day Moving Average for SWKS broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average, suggesting short-term bearishness.This has already started to take place, as the stock has moved lower by 8.3% in the past four weeks. And with the recent moving average crossover, investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for SWKS stock.If that wasn’t enough, Skyworks Solutions isn’t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either. It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately, which is usually not a good sign of things to come.Consider that in the last 30 days, 3 estimates have been reduced, while 1 has moved higher. Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate, and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here.That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead. So either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for SWKS.

2860,SWKS,"Skyworks Solutions Inc. (SWKS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 3, after the market closes. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether or not this semiconductor company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter.Notably, the company has an impressive earnings surprise history. In the trailing four quarters, its results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, coming up with an average positive earnings surprise of 4.1%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Skyworks Solution is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.It should be noted that stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) are best avoided, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Skyworks Solutions carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of -0.01%, which makes surprise prediction difficult. Furthermore, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal second-quarter earnings remained unchanged over the past 30 days.In addition, on a year-over-year basis, earnings and revenue growth rates are likely to have slowed down. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal second-quarter revenues and earnings is pegged at $910.4 million and $1.60, marking year-over-year growth of 6.9% and 10.3%, respectively. Notably, growth rates for the to-be-reported quarter are much lower than what the company witnessed in the previous quarter. In the fiscal first quarter, Skyworks Solutions’ revenues and earnings grew 15% and 24%, respectively.Skyworks Solutions, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Skyworks Solutions, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Skyworks Solutions, Inc. QuoteWhat’s Behind the Disappointing Projections?Overdependence on Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) for revenue generation continues to be a major headwind for the company. The company generates around 40% of its revenues by selling radio frequency chips, which are used in iPhone devices.It should be noted that Apple’s sales of iPhones have been below expectations, particularly the latest one — iPhone X. Owing to the troubles, this January, Apple slashed its production target by half from almost 40 million projected during the iPhone X release, per Nikkei.Moreover, Apple reported a dreary iPhone unit sales performance in the fiscal first quarter, thanks to the lower-than-expected holiday season sales of its premium device iPhone X.  For the quarter ending Dec 31, 2017, iPhone unit sales edged down 1% year over year.Goldman Sachs’ latest prediction regarding iPhone sales has put further shadow on the growth prospects of Apple’s component suppliers. The investment firm, in its Mar 27 note, announced trimming iPhone sales expectations by a whopping 1.7 million units to 53 million, for the March quarter. Also, for the quarter ending June, the firm forecasts sales of 40.3 million units, a decline of 3.2 million from the previous projection.Lower production implies lesser component requirement, which, in turn, will have a substantial impact on suppliers.Nonetheless, loss of business from Apple is expected to have been offset by elevated demand for Wi-Fi, Zigbee and LTE solutions. The demand for highly-integrated solutions is increasing as customers implement the next level of functionality for higher bandwidth. We believe Skyworks’ expanding product portfolio has the potential to address this rapidly growing need.Additionally, the company’s expanding customer base, which comprises the likes of Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report) in MIMO gateways, Nintendo (NTDOY  -  Free Report) in its Switch Gaming console, Fitbit, Garmin and LG, positions it well for growth.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2861,SWKS,"Earnings season unofficially kicked off this morning with the reports of big financials like JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) coming in before the bell. Those reports were a mixed bag, with industry headwinds weighing down each stock more than anything else, and investors will now look ahead to one of first busy weeks of another key reporting period.Earnings growth was certainly there for the bank giants—as one would expect in our rising rate environment—but today’s reports did little to inspire investors. A flattening yield curve will likely continue to subdue bank stocks for the time being.Elsewhere, earnings growth is expected to be aplenty this season—although it will take a strong batch of marquee reports for investors to overlook global economic uncertainty in the face of ongoing trade disputes. One important battleground will be in the technology sector, which will see a number of major reports next week.With that said, investors can always use the Zacks Earnings Calendar to plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases. This handy tool is your perfect one-stop-shop to properly prepare for the market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio.In this piece, we will be taking a look at three of the most-important reports from the tech sector to watch over the coming days. Make sure to keep an eye on these companies as they prepare to report during the week of July 16.1. Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report)Video streaming giant Netflix is scheduled release its latest quarterly earnings report after the closing bell on July 16. Netflix has largely been able to shake off market-wide volatility in 2018, posting more than 100% year-to-date gains en route to becoming one of Wall Street’s hottest tech stocks.However, a few bearish analyst reports in recent days have questioned whether the hot streak can continue, and the stock looks poised to carry a rare downtrend into its report date. Still, investors will be looking for impressive growth.According to our Zacks Consensus Estimates, analysts are expecting adjusted earnings of $0.80 per share and revenue of $3.94 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth of 433% and 41%, respectively. Investors should note, however, that this consensus EPS projection has shed a penny in the past month. 2. Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report)Tech behemoth Microsoft is scheduled to announce its latest quarterly financial results after the market closes on July 19. Cloud computing has helped Microsoft pick up steam in the past year, with shares gaining more than 42% in that time—including a decent 3.3% surge over the last month. Still, MSFT is holding just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now, and recent estimate revisions trends have been apathetic.In fact, for the soon-to-be-reported quarter, Microsoft has actually seen a negative estimate revision since last week, bringing our consensus projection down a penny. We are now looking for Microsoft to report adjusted earnings of $1.07 per share and revenue of $29.17 billion, which would mark growth rates of 9% and 18%. 3. Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (SWKS  -  Free Report)Popular chipmaker Skyworks Solutions is slated to release its most recent quarterly results after the closing bell on July 19. Skyworks is an American manufacturer of RF chips, which every cellphone needs to operate. This means Skyworks deals directly with companies like Apple (AAPL) and is a great bellwether for the smartphone industry.SWKS is currently holding a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for adjusted earnings of $1.59 per share and revenue of $887.7 million. This would represent minimal EPS growth of 1.3% and a revenue slump of 1.5%. Want more market analysis from this author?

2863,SWKS,"Shares of Xiaomi Corp. declined 5.9% at the beginning of its first day of trading on Jul 9, at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The Chinese smartphone manufacturer managed to raise just $54 billion, far below its expectations. In what was touted be one of the biggest IPOs of the year, this definitely is a disappointing start for the world’s fourth-largest mobile phone maker.Interestingly, Xiaomi’s debut on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange comes three days after the United States and China imposed tariffs of $34 billion on each other, thus waging a trade war against each other. Xiaomi’s IPO was being seen as an important tech listing among Internet giants from China like Tencent, which also plans to list its shares on a U.S. stock exchange. The disappointing start to Xiaomi’s stock saw the Shenzhen Component Index, which tracks technology and other new economy firms, falling to its lowest level in three and a half years on Jul 5. Top of FormThat said, Xiaomi was perhaps being overvalued and might just have given an indication that IPOs of tech companies may not enjoy lofty valuations in the tariff-trauma that mat grip the markets. However, tech stocks have been performing well and it’s still too early to say that trade war has started taking its toll on players in this corner.Xiaomi’s IPO Disappoints Xiaomi’s disappointing debut comes as a time when the U.S.-China trade war has just begun. At the same time, Chinese stocks have been taking a hit with the Shanghai Composite Exchange officially entering bear market in the last week of June. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange has declined more than 10% since early June.Given this scenario, doubts over Xiaomi’s lofty valuation started cropping up days after the company filed for its IPO. People close to the deal had initially expected that Xiaomi could raise at least $10 billion at a valuation of $100 billion that would have made it the biggest global offering since Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA  -  Free Report) made its debut at the NYSE four years ago.Xiaomi had priced its IPO at a price higher than tech giants such as Apple, Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report). However, it managed to open trade with a valuation of only $54 billion. Understandably, Xiaomi’s debut proves that investors have realized that at $100 billion, the company was being overvalued.Moreover, apart from trade war fears, what may have gone against Xiaomi is investors’ skepticism toward the company’s usual business model. Questions have also been raised over Xiaomi’s ability to increase profit margins in the future given that most of its smartphone are targeted at the low end of the market.Trade War May Not Really Affect Tech Companies The United States imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods on Jul 6. China retaliated with tariffs on an equal amount of goods. This definitely has made investors jittery. However, the list doesn’t contain products commonly purchased by Americans such as televisions and mobile phones.Interestingly, Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) despite losing a patent infringement case in a Chinese court last week, which could be a result of the trade dispute, said that it won’t impact the company much. This saw the company’s shares rise 0.7% on Jul 6. Micron has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.One of the biggest reasons behind this is that perhaps China knows that it cannot make microchips on their own and will have to rely on U.S. companies. The United States is the largest semiconductor manufacturing country, with China being its biggest market.Semiconductor giants like Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (SWKS  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm depend heavily on the Chinese market. In fact, Apple and Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) are among the top 16 U.S. companies that generated a total of $105.5 billion from China in 2017. Qualcomm, Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) generated respectively 16.6%, 9.5% and 1.9% of their revenues from China.Summing UpXiaomi’s disappointing debut might just be an indication that IPOs of tech companies may not live up to lofty valuations in the near term. Tech stocks are already reeling under trade war fears, which could possibly be another reason that went against Xiaomi.That said, it may be too early to assess if trade war will really take its toll on tech companies, as China depends heavily on U.S.-manufactured microchips. Naturally, imposing higher tariffs will adversely affect China itself.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.

2864,SWKS,"The United States formally imposed the first set of tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports on Jul 6. The trade war has finally been triggered, with China firing counter tariffs on an equal amount on imports from the United States.And if President Donald Trump does what he said he will do, the war will only intensify, with his additional tariffs that could reach an estimated worth of $500 billion Chinese goods. It now needs to be seen, who gains and who loses from the trade war, given that both countries have drawn up a long list of goods and services that will be impacted by higher import duties.Relief for Domestic Steel, Aluminum ManufacturersIn March, Trump announced tariffs of 25% and 10% on imported steel and aluminum, respectively, from China. The announcement came with the objective of protecting domestic steel and aluminum industry by increasing production, which will eventually help create more jobs.Trump’s decision was cheered by domestic steelmakers, as they stand to benefit from the newly imposed tariffs. On Thursday, shares of United States Steel Corporation X and Nucor Corporation NUE jumped 3.1% and 2.1%, respectively, while Steel Dynamics, Inc. STLD surged 3.3%. United States Steel Corporation has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Similarly, shares of Alcoa Corporation (AA  -  Free Report), Kaiser Aluminum Corporation (KALU  -  Free Report) and Century Aluminum Company (CENX  -  Free Report) jumped 2.4%, 1% and 0.2%, respectively, on Thursday.Manufacturing Sector to Suffer                                         American companies that earn huge revenues from China or sell products to that country will be hit by tariffs of 15% to 25%. Heavy equipment manufacturers and airplane makers are at the highest risk. Last year, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) earned 13% of its revenues from China. Moreover, the company also entered into a deal with a state-run Chinese company to sell 300 planes for $37 billion.Excavator and earth-moving manufacturing company Caterpillar, Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) has more than 20 facilities in China. Other heavy-equipment manufacturers like Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report) too will be hit hard as it will find it hard to manufacture equipment with higher-priced steel.Tough Time for Automakers Not only the automakers but the overall auto sector, comprising carmakers, auto parts and transportation companies will bear the brunt of tariffs. For them, the tariffs are more like a double-edged sword. While producing vehicles in the United States will attract higher tariffs in China, producing vehicles in China and importing them back to the United States means paying higher import duty.Almost 30% of General Motors Company’s (GM  -  Free Report) U.S. unit sales are imported from Mexico and China, Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) imports 20% of its vehicles from these two countries. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. (FCAU  -  Free Report) manufactures almost 50% of its vehicles in the United States, while the rest is imported from its Mexico and Canada plants. Tech Companies to Take a HitMany tech companies earn a significant portion of their revenues from China. Thus, a trade war will definitely affect tech companies, particularly chipmakers with significant exposure to China.The United States is the largest semiconductor manufacturing country, with China being its biggest market. Higher tariffs will take a toll on the revenues of these semiconductor manufacturers. Qualcomm has tie-ups with a large number of Chinese companies, including Huawei. Qorvo, Inc. (QRVO  -  Free Report) too generates almost 60% of its revenues from China.Similarly, other semiconductor giants like Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (SWKS  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm depend heavily on the Chinese market. In fact, Apple and Intel Corporation INTC are among the top 16 U.S. companies that generated a total of $105.5 billion from China in 2017. Qualcomm, Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA generated respectively 16.6%, 9.5% and 1.9% of their revenues from China.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research. It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

2865,SWKS,"The semiconductor corner of the broad technology market was badly hit last week amid a spate of negative news from industry players like chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing TSM and semiconductor-equipment supplier Lam Research LRCX.Taiwan Semiconductor reduced its target for sales growth in the global semiconductor industry this year to 5% from its prior outlook of 5-7% growth while Lam Research offered a disappointing outlook for chip-gear shipments for the rest of the year. Notably, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 4.3% on Apr 19, marking the biggest one-day drop for the index since Feb 8. In the past week, the index was down 4.4%.Additionally, the analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch dampened the mood by cutting the price target on chipmakers with heavy exposure to Apple's (AAPL  -  Free Report) iPhone business, including Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report), Cirrus Logic (CRUS  -  Free Report) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS  -  Free Report). The analyst expects chip stocks to go 4-7% lower (read: Should You Snap Up Downtrodden Semiconductor ETFs Now?).As a result, iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report), VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH  -  Free Report) and PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors Fund (PSI  -  Free Report) shed more than 4% each last week and clearly underperformed the broad technology fund (XLK  -  Free Report) by a wide margin. XLK lost just 0.2% in the same time frame. The weak trend might continue this earnings season given the lack of positive Earnings ESP but a series of positive estimate revision could provide some upside.According to the our methodology, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) when combined with a positive Earnings ESP increases our chances of predicting an earnings beat, while a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) are best avoided. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Most of the chipmakers like Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report), Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials AMAT are less likely to surprise this quarter while NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) is poised to beat estimates. Let’s delve into the earnings picture of those that have a higher allocation to the above-mentioned ETFs and the power to move the funds up or down as Q1 earnings unfold. SOXX is largely concentrated on the five firms, with a combined share of 35.5%, followed by 27.8% for SMH and 24.5% for PSI.Inside Our Earnings PredictionTexas Instruments is set to report on Apr 24, after market close. It has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of -1.39%, indicating lesser chances of beating estimates this quarter.

The company is expected to report results after the closing bell on Apr 25.Intel is slated to release earnings after market close on Apr 26. It has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -1.21%, implying a beat cannot be predicted this quarter. The stock has seen a negative earnings estimate revision of couple of cents over the past 90 days for the to-be-reported quarter but delivered a positive earnings surprise of 14.81% on average over the last four quarters. It has a VGM Score of A.NVIDIA, expected to report on May 8, has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.65%, indicating reasonable chances of beating estimates this quarter.

2866,SWKS,"After a stellar ride, the technology sector witnessed wild swings in March thanks to the decline in FANG stocks and other high-technology names. The tech onslaught stemmed from a slew of negative news from some of the key companies in the space.Behind The PlungeThe initial panic was created by Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) after the data breach report that sparked concerns about data privacy and security, and will likely lead to increased scrutiny and possible regulatory pressure. Then, Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) announced the suspension of self-driving tests, raising concerns over the new growth areas in the space and pushing shares down. Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) also dropped on expectations of further regulation on its social media platform while Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) touched a one-year low on Moody’s downgrade. All these news have raised concerns over the growth of the hottest technology trends like autonomous cars and artificial intelligence.Adding to the woes is the decline in Amazon shares late last week that has shed about $30 billion from its market value on a single day. News that President Donald Trump is looking to target the e-commerce giant over antitrust or competition laws and is considering ways to change the tax treatment took toll on the stock. As a result, the S&P Technology Sector was off 4% in March and is likely to see rough trading this month as well.Trade War Fears ReignitedFading trade war fears between the two largest economies, United States and China, seems back on the table with the start of April. China has retaliated against Donald Trump’s taxes on imported steel and aluminum with its own tariff of up to 25% on a series of 128 products worth $3 billion from the United States, including pork and wine, effective today. The Trump administration, looking to punish Beijing over technology transfer policies, is expected to unveil the list of Chinese imports targeted for U.S. tariffs this week.Trump has already signed an executive memorandum to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion in Chinese imports targeting the technology, telecom, and apparel sectors. The round of sanctions and retaliation could trigger a global trade war, hurting the global economy and corporate profits at big U.S. exporters. In particular, technology stocks, which are the biggest contributors of the nine-year bull market and a Trump rally, are expected to be hit hard as most of the tech companies, especially semiconductor manufacturers and software companies, have large operations in the Chinese market.Given this, we have highlighted five tech stocks to stay away from given their huge exposure to China. In spite of their double-digit projected earnings growth and positive estimate revisions for this year as well as a strong Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), these stocks are vulnerable to the ongoing trade jitters.Skyworks Solutions Inc. (SWKS  -  Free Report)This Massachusetts-based company designs, develops, manufactures, and markets proprietary semiconductor products, including intellectual property worldwide. The company saw rising earnings estimate revision of 11 cents for this fiscal (ending September 2018) over the past 60 days and has an expected growth rate of 12.40%. About 83% of the company’s revenues comes from China. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 and belongs to the bottom-ranked Zacks industry (bottom 18%). It was down nearly 6% last month.Micron Technology Inc (MU  -  Free Report)Micron Technology is one of the leading worldwide providers of semiconductor memory solutions. The stock saw solid earnings estimate revision of 68 cents for the fiscal year (ending August 2018) with an expected earnings growth rate of 121.57%.

2867,SWKS,"Reinforcing his protectionist agenda, President Donald Trump sought to levy new tariffs worth up to $60 billion on China, according to Reuters. Mainly Chinese apparel, technology and telecom goods are being subjected to this tariff. This month, Trump has imposed a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% on aluminum imports. These tariffs are likely to push up costs and weigh on international sales of U.S. companies (read: 5 ETFs to Buy in March & Forget Trade War, Inflation Fears).The Trump administration is also reportedly mulling over “imposing investment restrictions on Chinese companies over and above the heightened national security restrictions.”Needless to say, trade war fears are rife at the moment. Already, the European Union (EU) has threatened the United States of a tit-for-tat tariff on a range of consumer, agricultural and steel products. Now China could be the next in line to levy a retaliatory tariff (read: Trade War Talks Heat Up: ETFs & Stocks in Focus).Naturally, companies that have extensive trade relations with China might face the brunt of a trade war. Technology chip suppliers selling products to manufacturers in China will also be dealt a heavy blow. In fact, Goldman Sachs compiled some companies with considerable revenue exposure to China.Let’s take a look at those companies and the related ETFs.  Likely Stock and ETF Losers Industrial Boeing China is a key market for Boeing Co (BA  -  Free Report) where it serves as the largest exporter of America. Last September, the company said that it expects China to spend about $1.1 trillion over the next 20 years, purchasing more than 7,200 airplanes. The Chinese government has indicated that it might order Airbus in place of Boeing jets if the United States spoils its trade relation with China. Shares of Boeing fell 2.5% on Mar 14.Industrial ETFs like iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF ITA, SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA  -  Free Report) and Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI  -  Free Report) are highly invested in Boeing and could thus be hit hard.Technology Skyworks Solutions Inc (SWKS  -  Free Report)The company, which makes highly innovative analog semiconductors, has 85% revenue exposure to China, per Goldman, quoted on CNBC. The stock has moderate focus on ETFs like Global X Internet of Things Thematic ETF SNSR (around 6% weight) and iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report) (around 3.8% weight).Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report)The leader in 3G, 4G and next-generation wireless technologies has 69$ revenue exposure to China and has exposure in ETFs like SOXX (about 6%).NVIDIA Corp NVDAThis semiconductor company is 56% related to China and is heavy on ETFs like Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence Thematic ETF BOTZ (about 9% focus) and SOXX (about 8% focus).Other tech and semiconductor companies include Intel Corporation INTC, Micron Technology Inc. (MU), Applied Materials Inc. AMAT, Lam Research LRCX, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Amphenol Corporation (APH  -  Free Report), which have sales exposure of 22% to 55%to China.Consumer Discretionary Wynn Resorts Ltd (WYNN  -  Free Report)This owner and operator of casino resorts has 64% exposure to China. The stock has around 5% focus on each of PowerShares Dynamic Leisure and Entertainment PEJ and VanEck Vectors Gaming ETF BJK.Likely Stock & ETF Winners Small-Cap Retail & Technology Since Trump’s tariff plan will take consumer goods into consideration, small-cap apparel, footwear and toys companies are likely to benefit, which do not have much foreign exposure. PowerShares S&P SmallCap Consumer Discretionary Portfolio PSCD might gain in the days ahead.As far as small-cap apparel and shoe companies are concerned, the likes of Stage Stores Inc. SSI, Boot Barn Holdings Inc. BOOT and Xcel Brands Inc (XELB) may benefit from the import tariff.There is a small-cap technology ETF for investors, namely, PowerShares S&P SmallCap Information Technology Portfolio (PSCT  -  Free Report). As far as stocks are concerned, Comtech Telecommunications Corp. (CMTL  -  Free Report) and Stoneridge Inc. (SRI  -  Free Report) are some of the companies one may consider.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?    Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

2868,SWKS,"If imposition of a respective 25% and 10% tariff on steel and aluminum imports was not enough, President Trump is reportedly going to levy new tariffs worth up to $60 billion on China, targeting mainly the country’s telecom and technology sector. The Trump administration is also reportedly mulling over “imposing investment restrictions on Chinese companies over and above the heightened national security restrictions.”Meanwhile, the threat of a trade war has been looming large since the start of the month. Already, the European Union (EU) has threatened the United States with a tit-for-tat tariff on a range of consumer, agricultural and steel products. Now China could be the next in line to levy a retaliatory tariff (read: Trade War Talks Heat Up: ETFs & Stocks in Focus).The relationship between the United States and China has been in the spotlight since Trump’s election win in November 2016, as evident from the volley of verbal attacks made by Trump against China’s trade practices. Investors should note that China stocks fell into the questionable spot after Donald Trump’s win in 2016. This is because Trump was expected to take stricter steps on outsourcing, on which China is hugely dependent.Naturally, companies that have extensive trade relations with China would be at high risk of falling prey to trade war. In fact, Goldman Sachs has compiled a list of companies some companies with considerable revenue exposure to China. Per the source, technology chip suppliers selling their products to manufacturers in China are likely to be hit hard.Which Large-Cap Companies Are At Risk on Likely TariffsWe highlight a few tech companies (according to Goldman Sachs’ study) that have high sales exposure to China.Skyworks Solutions Inc (SWKS  -  Free Report)The company, which makes highly innovative analog semiconductors, has 85% revenue exposure to China, per Goldman, quoted on CNBC.Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report)The leader in 3G, 4G and next-generation wireless technologies is dependent on China with 69% exposure.NVIDIA Corp (NVDA  -  Free Report)This semiconductor company’s sales exposure to China is 56%Some other tech and semiconductor companies, which have sales exposure to China in the range of 22% to 55%, include the likes of Intel Corporation, Micron Technology Inc., Applied Materials Inc., Lam Research, Apple and Amphenol Corporation.Time for Small-Cap Tech Stocks?While these large-cap stocks may get hurt by the possible trade war, investors can take a look at small-cap technology stocks, which are more domestically focused and thus less vulnerable to souring trade relations.Stock PicksThe following tech stocks have market cap of less than 1 billion.Xplore Technologies Corp (XPLR  -  Free Report)This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company is in the business of developing integrating and marketing mobile wireless Tablet PC computing systems.

2872,SWKS,"The world’s largest and the ultra-popular large cap ETF, SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, has been enjoying its strong asset accumulation on the completion of its 25th anniversary. This is because it has become the first ETF with $300 billion in AUM. Though SPY’s inception date is Jan 22, 1993, it officially debuted on the American Stock Exchange on Jan 29, 1993 (read: Amazing ETF Strategies for Skyrocketing Markets).Inside The ETFSPY tracks the S&P 500 index and holds 505 stocks in its basket, with each security holding no more than 3.62%. This suggests a nice balance across each security and prevents heavy concentration.About one-fourth of the portfolio is tilted toward the information technology sector, which has fully emerged from the burst of the dot-com bubble and is flying higher in the current bullish market. Moreover, financials, health care, consumer discretionary and industrials, each of which accounts for a double-digit exposure, are also performing remarkably well.The ETF charges 9 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in heavy volume of 71.6 million shares a day on average. This ensures higher liquidity with a tight bid/ask spread, leading to lower trading costs for investors (see: all the Large Cap ETFs here).Factors Driving SPYThe U.S. stock market is in the midst of the second-longest bull run in history. Encouraging domestic and international fundamentals as well as better-than-expected corporate earnings are the major catalysts. This, coupled with Trump’s pro-growth agenda aimed at accelerating economic growth, reducing regulation, increasing spending, slashing taxes, and boosting jobs and corporate profits, are bolstering optimism in the economy.Since Trump’s win, the stock market rally has been the fourth largest since 1936, according to Goldman Sachs. Per Sam Stovall of CFRA Research, the S&P 500 rally during Trump’s first year is the third best since World War II, behind only President George H. W. Bush and President John F. Kennedy (read: Trump's First Year in Office: 5 Must-See ETF Charts).Further, a combination of other factors like rise in oil prices, a weak dollar and rounds of upbeat global economic data have bolstered the appetite for riskier assets in recent months. Good news flowing despite the global trade fears, political instability in Washington and geopolitical tension.As a result, SPY generated more than 545% returns over the past 25 years and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook.

2874,SWKS,"The year 2018 has started off with the rumor mills churning out news about major mergers and acquisitions. Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) is now rumored to show interest in Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report). Post President Donald Trump’s intervention into Broadcom-Qualcomm deal, chances of a possible merger has brightened up between the two big chip-makers.Intel Corporation Price Intel Corporation Price | Intel Corporation QuoteIntel carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Rationale Behind the Rumored DealBroadcom has been hogging the headlines of late with its hostile bid for Qualcomm. However, the deal has finally come to a conclusion, with President Trump prohibiting the proposed takeover on grounds of national security concerns. The rejection stems from Trump’s concern of conceding China the upper hand in 5G communications technology.Intel was skeptical that a Broadcom-Qualcomm combination could have posed serious competitive threats to its growing data centric business. Reportedly, the second-largest chipmaker had been planning to launch a bid for Broadcom since last year, which, however it postponed due to the ongoing Brocade integration.Further, Intel took a wait & watch policy after Broadcom announced the hostile bid for Qualcomm. We believe that Broadcom’s failed attempt to buy Qualcomm can now encourage Intel to make a bid as the acquisition willprovide its significant competitive advantage in the chip market.Further, a significant portion of Broadcom’s revenues come from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), which contributed more than 10% of revenues in fiscal 2017. Hence, grabbing Broadcom will improve Intel’s foothold into Apple’s supplier chain.We believe that this can be a major incentive for Intel to bid for Broadcom’s assets, which will improve its position in the mobile communications market.3 Technology Stocks at Risk The possibility of Intel acquiring Broadcomhas raised concerns among the chipmakers namely Skyworks Solutions (SWKS  -  Free Report), Qorvo (QRVO  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report).Let’s dig into the details on how these semiconductor companies will be hurt by Intel-Broadcom deal:Firstly, Skyworks Solutions, a designer as well as a manufacturer of high performance analog and mixed signal semiconductors,stands to get hurt from Intel-Broadcom deal. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is significantly dependent on Apple, which accounts for about 40% of Skyworks’ revenues.Skyworks Solutions, Inc. Price Skyworks Solutions, Inc. Price | Skyworks Solutions, Inc. QuoteSkyworks has won contracts in recent times from multiple Tier 1 original equipment manufacturers (OEM) including Apple. The company’s growing presence into Internet of Things (IoT), connected cars, and 5G are significant growth drivers.However, Intel-Broadcom deal can put this ambition into jeopardy. The sheer size of the combined entity will put significant pricing pressure on Skyworks leading to declining margin profile.Secondly, let’s gauge the impact of this possible deal on Qorvo. This Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) companyis a leading provider of core technologies and radio frequency (RF) solutions for mobile, infrastructure and aerospace/defense applications. A significant portion of Qorvo’s revenues come from a handful of customers including Apple and Huawei, which contributed 34% and 11% of its revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2017.Qorvo, Inc. Price Qorvo, Inc. Price | Qorvo, Inc. QuoteQorvo’s BAW filters, antenna tuners, RF front end modules and envelope tracking power management solution were used in Huawei’s flagship Mate 10 device. Moreover, the company tested the industry’s first RF front end module addressing 5G standalone and 5G non-standalone requirements.During the quarter,  Qorvo was selected as a provider of front-end power amplifiers (PA) to Qualcomm for its Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) Reference Design. This will help the company penetrate deeper into the automotive industry.However, Broadcom’s Wireless Communications segment serves the smartphone market with similar products that include a broad variety of RF semiconductor devices, connectivity solutions and custom touch controllers is the closest competitor to Qorvo.Hence, it’s obvious that if Intel acquires Broadcom, it will intensify the competition for Qorvo.Lastly, Micron remains one of the outstanding performers in the semiconductor space. Notably, this Zacks Rank #2 is witnessing improved pricing as well as elevated demand for DRAM and NAND chips. Mobile Business Unit (“MBU”) which includes Micron’s DRAM, NAND Flash, and NOR Flash products that are sold to smartphone, feature phone, and tablet mobile-device manufacturers accounted for 22% of fiscal 2017 revenues. Moreover, Micron recently added Apple to its customer roster.Micron Technology, Inc. Price Micron Technology, Inc. Price | Micron Technology, Inc. QuoteIf Intel buys Broadcom the combined strength will pose significant threat to Micron's position in the Flash-based products market. Further, the combination can help Intel grab share from the company in Apple’s supply chain base.Bottom LineWhile Apple stands to gain from the deal, Skyworks, Qorvoand Micron could lose out if it goes through. This explains their opposing stands on the issue even as the fate of this rumored deal hangs in the balance.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

2878,SWKS,"Skyworks Solutions Inc. (SWKS  -  Free Report) unveiled a new suit of network-driven solution that supports wireless 5G networks called Sky5.Sky5 solution is a platform that deals with revolutionary 5G applications. According to the press release, “Our Sky5 solutions will address new 5G waveforms and spectrum, enhanced carrier aggregation, dual connectivity (4G/5G) and massive MIMO requirements while delivering unmatched levels of integration and performance, all underpinned by Skyworks’ intellectual property, operational scale and financial strength.”Advantage of 5GIts common knowledge that 5G has achieved rapid momentum over the past year. In the near future, operators will likely need to support zillions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices which are expected to be wirelessly connected. This has huge technical implications, and its implementation will entail huge time and costs.5G, which marks a revolution in the field of communications and technology, is anticipated to accumulate connections starting 2020. By 2021, there should be 25 million 5G connections worldwide. Moreover, 5G mobile handsets will be available for sale in the market by 2020, following a broader rollout of the technology.Moreover, per May 2017 Research and Markets report, the 5G network infrastructure market is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 70% between 2019 and 2025. This will ultimately account for $28 billion in annual spending by the end of 2025.The 5G network will provide 50 times the throughput of the currently available 4G LTE network. Further, 5G technology is designed to be more power efficient than any other standard wireless network. Consequently, such 5G-enabled solutions are likely to last longer than their 3G or 4G counterparts. Consequently,Skyworks is well-positioned to capitalize on the 5G based infrastructures with a rising demand for high-performance analog solutions in new markets.Bottom line The manufacturer of high performance analog and mixed signal semiconductors’ strength is further intensified by increased demand for highly integrated solutions as customers implement the next level of functionality for higher bandwidth.With a customer base comprising the likes of Cisco in MIMO gateways, Nintendo in its Switch Gaming console; Fitbit, Garmin and LG, the company is on strong growth trajectory. Notably, the upcoming 5G upgrade cycle is also a major positive.Skyworks’ shares have returned 29.9% in a year, substantially outperforming the industry’s rally of 22.7%. However, customer concentration remains a risk as a significant portion of Skyworks’ revenues comes from a handful of customers, particularly Apple. Moreover, slow growth rate of the smartphone market and piled up inventories with Chinese smartphone providers remain headwinds.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderSkyworks currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

2884,SWKS,"Welcome back to the Mind Over Money podcast. I’m Kevin Cook, your field guide and story teller for the fascinating arena of behavioral economics.This episode is all about how fast the future is coming at us.I’ve talked before about the book Bold by Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotler. Diamandis is friends with futurist Ray Kurzweil who describes the advance of science and technology with the word “exponential.” And so that’s why in Bold, they describe these 6 “exponential technologies:""1. Robotics2. Infinite computing3. Synthetic biology4. Artificial intelligence5. Networks and sensors6. 3-D “printing” (more accurately additive manufacturing)Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) would fall within and between technologies 2, 4, and 5. A recent Bank of America research report forecasts that AR-related sales will grow more than 30 times to $160 billion in the year 2020.And some analysts believe that Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) will be at the forefront of many of these AR applications as they seek to answer the question ""What's after the iPhone?""To grasp why we should call these exponential technologies, think of elements in your lifetime that have rapidly changed your work, travel, education and entertainment from amazing computing tools and super advanced cars to on-demand videos and programming on just about every topic you could want to learn, or just be entranced by.You might be wondering why I didn’t emphasize the smartphone and its dramatic impact not only on economics but on our behavior. I talk about that addictive gadget and its predecessor, television, in the podcast that accompanies this article.Future ShockNow let’s honor another futurist ahead of his time (as if they could be anything but), the late great Alvin Toffler. For you youngsters who don't know the Tofflers, let me cite this excellent intro from Wikipedia...Alvin Toffler (October 4, 1928 – June 27, 2016) was an American writer, futurist, and businessman known for his works discussing modern technologies, including the digital revolution and the communication revolution, with emphasis on their effects on cultures worldwide.Toffler was an associate editor of Fortune magazine. In his early works he focused on technology and its impact, which he termed ""information overload."" In 1970 his first major book about the future, Future Shock, became a worldwide best-seller and has sold over 6 million copies.He and his wife Heidi Toffler, who collaborated with him for most of his writings, moved on to examining the reaction to changes in society with another best-selling book, The Third Wave in 1980. In it, he foresaw such technological advances as cloning, personal computers, the Internet, cable television and mobile communication. His later focus, via their other best-seller, Powershift, (1990), was on the increasing power of 21st-century military hardware and the proliferation of new technologies.I am very interested to find out what Alvin and Heidi were thinking even 5 years ago when Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Chinese web giants like Alibaba were either surpassing or on their way to surpassing the size of GE, Microsoft, Intel and IBM. Were they ever surprised or simply amazed at the way the Internet created massive wealth and massive disruption in industry after industry in such a short time?I imagine they were occasionally in shock, or simply in awe. But they also understood the exponential nature of these changes and the compound growth of wealth that could feed new innovation – especially in the R&D labs of these new nation-states of the cyber-sphere.Everyone can grasp the exponential advance of population growth, technology patents, and transistors on microchip processors. The latest NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) GPU systems for advanced machine learning/AI applications, and for only a few thousand bucks, have 21 billion transistors.Hardly anyone I know is impressed by that because we just take the relentless march of computing power and miniaturization for granted.But you have to ask yourself, if even the smartest futurists like Toffler and Kurzweil could only get about half of their predictions right, how can you or I really know what’s coming, in what time frame and in what combinations?I think we have to be prepared for a world 10 years from now that could be very different from the one even 5 years ago.Finding Cassandras to Stop CatastrophesThat’s the subtitle of a new book I’m reading called Warnings by Richard A. Clarke and R.P. Eddy, both well-known national security advisors. Their goal is to highlight how very smart and prescient experts from various fields must be sought out and listened to when they have warnings for us.In short, the authors believe in the power of the expert to prevent disaster.In the first half of the book, they describe seven prior “catastrophes” where Cassandras were ignore, like Hurricane Katrina, the rise of ISIS, and Bernie Madoff’s Ponzi scheme.Then they identify seven current warnings and their expert voices, from fields such as artificial intelligence, pandemic disease, and rising sea levels.In the podcast, I chose to share some excerpts from two chapters in particular...The Engineer: The Internet of Everything (details coming up).And…The Biologist: Gene EditingThe Cassandra for biology is actually the scientist who helped discover the gene editing technology known as CRISPR, biochemist Jennifer Doudna.CRISPR stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, which are part of the structure of a bacterial defense system that forms the basis for CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology. It can be programmed to target specific stretches of genetic code and to ""edit"" DNA at precise locations.The primary technology that makes it possible to edit genes uses a naturally occurring enzyme called Cas9 that can ""cut"" DNA. Cas9 helps protect good bacterial cells by cutting the DNA of invading viruses, thus creating the microbial immune systems dubbed CRISPR.With these systems, researchers can permanently modify genes in living cells and organisms and, in the future, may make it possible to correct mutations at precise locations in the human genome in order to treat genetic causes of disease.In Warnings, Clarke and Eddy tell Doudna's story of her early science career and the discovery of CRISPR very well in just a few pages. At Harvard in the 1990s, she became fascinated with RNA, DNA's so-called secretary...""But there was a growing belief that RNA did more than just run DNA's errands and fetch its coffee, and Doudna's doctoral and post-doc work focused on this new theory.""In 2002, she became a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, continuing her work by investigating the RNA of viruses. In 2005, her colleague Dr. Jill Banfield approached her regarding some work she had been doing with unique bacteria found in a highly acidic abandoned mine.The genetic material of many of these bacteria contained ""clustered, regularly-interspaced, short, palindromic repeats"" or CRISPR for short. In essence, some of the DNA repeats itself.Scientists had learned over the years that there are ""spacers"" between these repeated sections, and that the spacers consist of sequences of DNA from viruses that had previously invaded the bacteria. The genetic code stored between these repeats plays a special role in some sort of bacterial immune system, allowing the cell's defense mechanisms to quickly identify a re-invading virus and ""cut up"" its genetic material.Two Women Who Just Changed the WorldIn 2012, Doudna's research really took off when she met French microbiologist Emmanuelle Charpentier, who was studying flesh-eating bacteria and using CRISPR sequences to protect cells from viral invasion.The two worked together for about a year and soon realized ""that their exploration had transcended basic research and had become a genetic tool with the power to reshape and engineer any known DNA-based life form.""Their collaboration to discover CRISPR as a gene editing tool is being hailed as a great medical achievement because it opens the door ways to altering and preventing inherited diseases. But it also raises the specter of bio-engineering ""custom"" babies and super humans.In 2013, several of the scientists credited with discovering and developing CRISPR joined forces to establish what is now called Editas Medicine (EDIT  -  Free Report). Those scientists – Feng Zhang, George Church and Jennifer Doudna – along with fellow founders Keith Joung and David Liu, were focused on translating the new technology into therapies that enable precise and corrective molecular modification to treat people with a broad range of diseases at the genetic level.In November 2013, Editas Medicine secured a $43 million Series A financing led by Flagship Pioneering, Polaris Partners and Third Rock Ventures, with participation from the Partners Innovation Fund, and assembled a strong leadership team and board of directors.“The way to think about [CRISPR] is molecular surgery,” said Dr. J. Keith Joung, director of the molecular pathology unit at Massachusetts General Hospital and a cofounder of Editas Medicine. “The idea is you can go in and make changes to the DNA, the component that makes up all of our genes. If there’s a defect, you can fix it; if there’s a missing piece, you can put the missing piece in.”There were always concerns from the beginning about this brand new technology, as Callum Borchers described for the Boston Globe four years ago this month when the company was new in Cambridge, MA...But while the emerging field of genome engineering holds tremendous potential, it presents ethical questions. If doctors can someday modify genes to prevent an unborn child from developing Down syndrome, for instance, what’s to stop them from engineering made-to-order babies with Olympic-caliber athleticism and the hair and eye colors their parents request?A Crack in CreationThere are many moving pieces to the CRISPR story, including strained friendships between Doudna and Charpentier, two public companies competing with the technology, and two research labs competing over patent rights.Editas Medicine was the first CRISPR-focused company to go public in February of 2016. Then CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP  -  Free Report) had its IPO in October of 2016.The competing research houses are UofC-Berkeley and the Broad Institute.But the most interesting part of the story may be what our Cassandra, Jennifer Doudna, is concerned about. And I just found the next book I'm reading to learn more about it. In June, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt published her tale of discovery and caution titled A Crack in Creation: Gene Editing and the Unthinkable Power to Control Evolution.The Cyber Espionage ThreatIn the podcast, the other chapter I read from in Warnings profiles engineer Joe Weiss and his deep experience with the energy grid -- and its attackers. I had read some research earlier this year about the growing sophistication of ""cyber espionage"" where nation-states could take warfare into new digital territory.Part of the problem as we hurtle into the future is that every new technology advance brings with it new problems to solve. Having billions of devices connected in the Internet of Everything sounds great for communications, speed, and security. This trend made me an eager investor in Skyworks Solutions (SWKS  -  Free Report) the company that makes most of the RFID chips for thousands of uses.But this trend only sounds great until something gets hacked and money, property, and even lives are at stake.On top of cyber attacks that get the headlines, like the Equifax breach and more recently Uber, the possibility of state cyber terror inspired me to get more familiar with companies like FireEye (FEYE  -  Free Report) and Cyber-Ark Software (CYBR  -  Free Report).Be sure to listen to the podcast to hear more about today's Cassandras like Joe Weiss.Disclosure: I own shares of AAPL, NVDA, and FEYE for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio, and EDIT for the Zacks Healthcare Innovators portfolio.Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks Investment Research where he runs the TAZR Trader and Healthcare Innovators services.

2885,SWKS,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (SWKS  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Skyworks Solutions has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18.2, as you can see in the chart below:    This level actually compares favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at 20.7. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, the current PE level is above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with its sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 22.9. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Skyworks Solutions has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 15.1, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term too.PEG RatioWhile earnings are certainly important, it is essential to know how much you are paying for the growth of earnings as well. One can easily do that with the PEG ratio (ratio of the P/E to the expected future earnings growth rate).The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture of the valuation of a stock than the P/E ratio.Skyworks Solutions’ PEG ratio stands at just 1, compared with the sector’s average of 2. This suggests a decent undervalued trading relative to its earnings growth potential right now.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Skyworks Solutions currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Skyworks Solutions a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Skyworks Solutions might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of D. This gives SWKS a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current year has seen four estimates go higher in the past thirty days compared to two lower, while the next year estimate has one up and one down in the same time period.As a result, the consensus estimate for the current year has risen by 0.3% in the past month, while the next year estimate has inched higher by 15.3%.

Segments that were once relatively untouched by the recent revolutions that we have seen in the world of computing, communications, and information are now finally being revamped with high tech processes.Two such major shifts as of late in the market come to us in the world of FinTech—which blends technology and finance into new types of banking, card processing, and the like—and also the Internet of Things, a wide market that touches everything from household products to industrial machinery by connecting a variety of devices to the internet so that they can send and receive data or instructions.Both FinTech and the Internet of Things look to be high growth areas and could completely change their respective industries in the near future too. And with this kind of growth potential, investors have to be asking what are the key points to know about these impressive industries?Well, for some insights on these new areas of the tech world, I spoke to Jay Jacobs, the VP, Director of Research at Global X for this week’s Dutram Report. We discussed these two markets in greater detail, and what investors need to be aware of in both of these increasingly in-focus corners of the stock and ETF world.FinTechFirst up, we discussed the topic of ‘FinTech’, arguably the less famous of the two areas, though it is certainly an important market in its own right. Jay clues us in on the growth that is being seen in this market as of late, and what the key industries are for the near future.We also talk about the Global X FinTech Thematic ETF (FINX  -  Free Report) and how investors can obtain broad exposure to this market via the fund. The product goes beyond usual suspects like PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report), and we discuss some of the other components here such as Intuit (INTU  -  Free Report) or those in the banking and asset management side, and how they fit into the overall theme.Jay also talks about what kinds of companies—from a cap perspective—are generally included in the fund, and what the most built-up areas of the FinTech ecosystem are right now. Check out the podcast for additional insights though!Internet of ThingsAfter that, we discuss one of my favorite topics in the new-tech world, and that is the Internet of Things. I am a huge fan of Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) entrant in this space, the Echo, but Jay explains how the market goes well beyond this consumer product and hits a variety of areas.One such segment that could be a huge beneficiary of the soaring demand for internet-connected devices is the semiconductor space. Jay discusses how the Internet of Things could be a huge growth avenue for the market, and how this may benefit players like Skyworks (SWKS  -  Free Report) or even Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) in the process.Jay also discusses the Global X way to play the broad industry, the Internet of Things ETF (SNSR  -  Free Report). We talk about the construction of the fund, the level of foreign exposure here, and how companies are included or not in the ETF. This is especially important for this industry, as many companies are not completely focused on the Internet of Things world, so make sure to check out the podcast for the Global X process here.Bottom LineBut what do you think about these new areas of the tech world?

The increase is expected to be driven by robust demand for connected home, smart grid, factory automation, wearables and virtual assistants.Notably, the 5G upgrade cycle is also a major tailwind for the company. Moreover, the company also enriched its product portfolio by launching high efficiency power amplifiers for advanced LTE applications. The demand for highly integrated architecture is increasing with the transition from 4G to 5G technology. These products bode well for the company’s performance.Skyworks Solutions, Inc.
