3,XYL,"Among Carillon Scout Mid Cap Fund's (UMBMX) holdings, such stocks as Abiomed (ABMD), Arista Networks (ANET) and Comerica (CMA) are providing enough lift to keep the fund ahead of its midcap blend fund peers and within shouting distance of the S&P 500.X The fund is down 0.37% this year as of Feb. 28 vs. a 0.87% decline by its midcap blend peers tracked by Morningstar Direct and a 1.83% gain by the S&P 500.But it's the fund's longer-term performance that catches the eye. It's outperformed both its peers the S&P 500 in the past one, three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31. It rose 24.02%, and an average annual 14.17%, 16.35% and 11.13% in the past three, five and 10 years.Former Air Force B-52 bomber crew member Patrick Dunkerley and his co-managers oversee the top performing mutual fund. In an interview with IBD, Dunkerley credited the strong showing to his investment team, their disciplined investment process that combines fundamental, marco economic and technical analysis, as well as a flexible valuation approach.IBD: You not only beat peer midcap funds in the past 1, 3, 5 and 10 years, but you also beat the S&P 500 in that period, one of only 16 mid cap funds to do so. What's behind the strong performance in both short term and long term?Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersPatrick Dunkerley: We are fortunate to have performed well over many years and different time periods. We seek to generate good risk-adjusted returns as measured against our benchmark, the Russell Midcap Index.  I credit our team members, including our team chemistry plus our disciplined investment process for this sustained performance.Co-managers Derek Smashey and John Indellicate have been with us since inception in 2006, and co-manager Jason Votruba joined us in 2013, along with senior analysts Craig West following health care and Eric Chenoweth following energy and utilities, who joined us in 2016 and 2017 respectively.Our investment process is unique because we incorporate both top-down macroeconomic and company specific analysis, with an emphasis on quality stocks, and a flexible valuation approach, which changes depending if market conditions are bullish or bearish.IBD: The biggest exposure has been to tech, consumer cyclical, financial services and industrials. What do you see the source of performance in the balance of this year? What macro trends are affecting your decisions?Dunkerley: Healthy leading indicators, good credit availability, adequate money supply growth, and an upward slope to the U.S. Treasury yield curve all support our bullish equity view at the moment, but increased volatility seems likely given the market sentiment is adjusting to higher interest rates.  From a sector point of view, we are sticking with investments in cyclical companies for now, with an emphasis on technology, financials — including banks and insurance companies that benefit from higher interest rates, industrials, materials, and energy as strong U.S. and global growth is lifting earnings.The consumer discretionary sector is enjoying a new tailwind, with retail sales coming in stronger than expected, and more earnings performance likely as the U.S. tax cuts and wage increases stimulate growth.  We believe stock selection is important so we own deep discounters such as Ross Stores (ROST), or other retailers than can blunt the effect of online competition.  In addition, consumer companies offering unique experiences such as Live Nation Entertainment (LYV) benefit as millennial consumers seek entertainment, such as live concerts.We believe U.S. inflation will increase and the dollar should continue to be soft if risk-on investor sentiment prevails in 2018.Our position in gold miner Newmont Mining (NEM) helps to insulate the portfolio from a gradually declining U.S. dollar, and should capture benefits from an improving gold price due to curtailed capital spending in the gold mining industry. The company pays a 1.4% cash dividend yield, and has unhedged exposure to the gold price.Stronger defense spending funded by the recent federal budget should help companies like Harris (HRS), a leader in military radios. In addition, companies like Hexcel (HXL) and Xylem (XYL) are profiting from global growth in aircraft demand and the need for better water treatment, respectively.We expect equity markets to rise further, but, if credit conditions turn bearish due to an overly aggressive Federal Reserve, then we would become more defensively positioned.  This will eventually happen, but it's not happening at the moment and we believe bullish conditions for U.S. equities are intact, despite the recent volatility in the markets.IBD: Where are we in the small cap, mid cap and large cap cycle of outperformance/underperformance?Dunkerley: We think mid caps are set up for competitive performance with the other capitalization categories. For the trailing 10 years ended Dec. 31, 2017, U.S. midcaps and small caps have outperformed their large-cap cousins, as measured by the various Russell indexes, with midcaps generating the best returns over that time period.  This midcap outperformance is consistent with longer-term historical data dating back to 1979, although we would caution that mid caps do not outperform in every time period.For example, last year, the large caps outperformed.  But, given the long-term historical outperformance of U.S. midcaps, they deserve a premium valuation and currently they do trade at a slight premium to large caps, based on forward looking (estimated) price-to-earnings ratios.  We believe the recent outperformance of large caps was driven by a valuation discount that was too wide.  But that discount has narrowed.IBD: Do you buy only midcap companies or will you buy large caps and small caps as long as they don't lift or lower the average market cap above or below midcap?Dunkerley: We seek to buy stocks within the market capitalization range of our benchmark, the Russell Midcap Index, with particular emphasis on companies with greater than a $2 billion market capitalization as they are often more liquid.IBD: What's your process for buying stocks? Do you start with screening for fundamentals?Dunkerley: We believe an active approach can outperform the benchmark by choosing higher-quality stocks, and by employing both top-down and bottom-up portions of our research process.  We follow over 150 economic indicators on a weekly basis, and we employ a toolbox approach to valuation, utilizing different tools during a bull market cycle to measure upside potential of a stock, while paying more attention to downside valuation risk during bear markets.We believe a good understanding of the macroeconomic picture helps us to more effectively position the portfolio sector weights, which are important.In addition, our bottom up research checklist helps us to identify the fundamentally strong companies with favorable financial characteristics, undervaluation, good business models, effective management, and that are free from serious litigation risks.IBD: How big a role does technical analysis play in your selection process?Dunkerley:  We do look at charts, particularly as an aid for timing of trades, or to help better understand the fundamental picture at a company.  Some of the ""cheapest"" stocks in the long run, in other words the best long-term investments from my experience, are found making new highs.We don't have to be the first to buy or sell a stock in order to be successful, as significant moves up or down can often be long lasting.  So quite often, the market will ""discover"" a stock as evidenced by strong price action seen in the chart. We just have to do the fundamental work to make sure the investment is sustainable. We also buy stocks that are experiencing price corrections if we think they have the quality characteristics we seek, so we are not exclusively buying stocks near highs.IBD's TAKE: Many of the top performing stocks in the past were trading at new price highs and above-average P-Es before they made the biggest gains of their run-ups. IBD: What are your sell rules?Dunkerley: Our process is to sell a stock due to a negative change in the fundamentals, problematic valuation, if we find a better investment alternative, or to manage our portfolio characteristics. One advantage of active management is the ability to seek to sell stocks with weakening fundamentals before the bad news is fully reflected in the stock price, so we strive to act decisively when our thesis changes.IBD: Do you spend much time talking with company management or do balance sheet and earnings report tell you what you need to know?Dunkerley: We believe the numbers reported by companies are one of the most important clues in securities analysis, determining the quality of the business, spotting trends, and evaluating the effectiveness of management. Good investment practice involves a thorough understanding of the cash flow statement and balance sheet, in addition to the income statement. We believe too many investors ignore the former and emphasize the latter, and this causes problems particularly during bear markets.However, we also like to invest with good management teams, and our investment team meets with various company managements nearly every week, or sees them at conferences in order to better size up their strategies and abilities.We also read conference call transcripts to deepen our understanding of the businesses and better understand the strategy of management, in addition to face-to-face meetings.Finally, competitive dynamics are always important and we seek to own companies we perceive as having a sustainable advantage so they can better protect profits and grow, such as a unique products or strong industry position, new product cycle, or management skill.  But we don't exclude commodity businesses that we think are experiencing an upcycle in fundamentals.IBD: Do you have a standard size, steps or range for beginning positions?Dunkerley: We often ramp a new position to at least 50 basis points (half of 1%) of the portfolio fairly quickly.IBD: Your portfolio is quite diversified with 154 stocks and 18% in the top 10 and no stock account for more than a little above 3%. How do you manage your winners?Dunkerley: We let winners run when it seems prudent to do so, although we often trim the position if we think the upside move is overdone. Our forward-looking valuation tool, the discounted earnings model helps us to gauge upside potential in a stock, primarily during bull markets.We build these for each stock we invest in, it's part of our fundamental analysis. So if we notice a stock discounting too much of its future potential, we will often trim it down or swap into another stock. This is another advantage of active management over passive, when properly executed.IBD: What strategy do you have for lagging stocks that were put into the portfolio with expectations of superior gains but become a drag on portfolio performance?Dunkerley: Our sell discipline is well defined, and has helped us to outperform our Russell Midcap benchmark by controlling downside risk. We will sell or trim a stock when we detect fundamental deterioration in the business outlook, or if we determine that high valuation is an outsized risk. Each of our team members covers one or more sectors of the market, and we emphasize looking at the downside risks all of the time, but especially prior to each quarterly earnings report.So we do a lot of work detecting and analyzing downside risk factors in the stocks we own. It's an ongoing project, and we seek to avoid complacency regarding the fundamentals or the valuation. Keeping tabs on stocks we already own is the majority of the work we do typically.IBD: Turning to a few of your top holdings, DXC (DXC) has run up 50% since last April and is trading at all-time highs near 103, with a market cap of $29 billion. What do you like about the Hewlett Packard Enterprise spinoff? Sales are down and it's expected to post its first profit in five years. And does the stock have more room to run, or is it getting too rich — and its market cap too big?Dunkerley: A clearer picture of the earnings history can be found under the former ticker CSC. On a GAAP basis, the company was profitable four out of the past five years.  The top end of the market capitalization range of the Russell Midcap Index is currently near $40 billion, so a $29 billion market cap company is a midcap company as currently defined by Russell.We think the stock is cheap at under 7X total enterprise value to EBITDA if you look two years out, and Mike Lawrie, the CEO there has a great track record of delivering earnings progress, and positive shareholder actions such as special dividends and spinoffs.  If they successfully spinoff the government technology services business, that will be the second time he has accomplished a spinoff since 2015, back when it was named Computer Sciences and they spun off CSRA, another government services technology business.They also paid a $10.50 per share special dividend that year, so a repeat in 2018 of a special dividend would be sweet, but we can't forecast that.This is not a rapid top-line growth situation, it is more about rationalizing the business and managing it more efficiently, so margins can expand.  The recent merger with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Services gives Lawrie a bigger platform to work with. This is one of the best CEOs in America today, we think. So this is an investment in good management execution in what is a competitive technology services industry. We have owned this stock for many years and it has performed terrifically for shareholders.IBD: Abiomed has also run up, but it continues to post big earnings increases. What's the potential for this stock and what are the risks?Dunkerley: For the long term, we think Abiomed has great prospects.  They have a strong competitive position in small heart pumps for cardiac surgeries. We think the available possible total market (TAM) for these pumps could be as much as an estimated 500 thousand units globally over time, although we don't expect Abiomed to capture all of that market, as few companies ever do that and competition almost always surfaces at some point.We estimate their unit volumes just passed the 24,000 annualized run rate, so there is a long potential runway to this story. Their products are life savers in the hands of a well-trained cardiac surgeon, and they are expanding overseas.The risks in a stock like this are usually competition, which is developing slowly, high statistical valuation that can lead to a correction in the stock, or some type of unexpected flaw in the technology, or poor execution. Since their devices are approved and used in the U.S., Japan, and Germany, among others, and they have great sales and profit momentum, we view the latter risk as low. The stock has had a great run so it could be a better one to buy on pullbacks.IBD:  Atmos Energy (ATO) is 12% off its high and looking for a bottom. What's your thinking on this stock's prospects at this point?Dunkerley: This is a quality utility company, serving the lower-risk market of regulated gas utility service, with a service footprint in eight states including a large presence in Texas.  Regulated utilities offer a better safety profile in our opinion than many industries, so we have owned them in size from time to time when the cycle is right, such as when we expect interest rates to be stable or falling.Atmos has an excellent safety record, which helps them to gain favor with state regulators, and that has driven better than average earnings growth. They also maintain a conservative balance sheet, which we like.Atmos may be one of the few utilities that keeps a chunk of their tax savings from the recent corporate tax cuts, due to potential favorable treatment in Texas, where 70% of their assets are located. However, that is a developing situation and will depend on political outcomes, never a certainty.The main concern with the stock now is the direction of interest rates, which have moved higher.  So Atmos has moved down with the utility sector. Our weighting in utilities is underweight currently vs. the benchmark due to our outlook for higher interest rates.IBD: What happened to Arista Networks that it's 22% off its all-time high after beating earnings estimates? How do you handle a stock like this?Dunkerley: Arista is a share taker in the fast-growing switch market for cloud infrastructure. However after a big run-up, the stock has pulled back, possibly due to what we perceive as conservative guidance by management. We think Arista's advantages are in their software and management expertise, so we are confident in their long-term outlook. Enterprises are rapidly shifting workloads to the cloud and Arista's networking software was built for this environment.IBD: What's your favorite stock at this point, the one with potential to deliver the strongest performance?Dunkerley: For the near to intermediate term, I would have to go with DXC Technologies, our largest holding due to its low valuation and potential operating margin improvement, the potential for a spinoff, and or another special dividend. The global macroeconomic background is favorable for technology companies at the moment, with decent economic growth in many areas of the world, a change from a few years back.Finally, technology spending is a capital expenditure which we think can do well in the middle to late part of an economic cycle, since we believe companies are more likely to spend on technology systems when they feel better about their financial prospects. The recent corporate tax cut in the U.S. helps reinforce our point of view on this, we believe.  However, for the long-term, Abiomed may have the greatest upside potential due to reasons previously mentioned.IBD: Where did you serve in the Air Force, and are there any aspects of serving in the military that translate well to money management?Dunkerley: I served in B-52 bomber units, and was stationed in Maine and California. Military service is good at fostering teamwork and communications skills, and the ability to perform under stress. I enjoyed my time of service and learned a great deal.RELATED:Look Who's Replacing This Top Fidelity Manager During His LeaveWhat's The Stock Market Doing Now?

5,XYL,"Buffalo Discovery Fund (BUFTX) turns to market disrupters like Align Technology (ALGN) and long-term secular trends in shaping its investment strategy, which has landed the fund among the top mutual funds in the third annual IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards.The $1.9 billion fund has been led by Clay Brethour, Dave Carlsen and Elizabeth Jones since 2004. ""We seek the early identification of attractively priced, financially strong, well-managed companies,"" Carlsen said. ""We take a patient approach to stock selection, looking for stock opportunities where long-term growth is underappreciated or where there's been an overreaction in the near term.""The approach has paid off for the top-performing mutual fund. It has beaten the S&P 500 in each of the past one, three, five and 10 years. In doing so it won IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards in both the Growth Fund and Midcap Fund categories.Over the last 10- and 15-year periods the fund has turned in average annual returns of 13.6% and 14.7%. These gains have handily surpassed those of midcap growth funds tracked by Morningstar, which have posted 9.6% and 11.4% returns for the same periods. Where does that put it among top mutual funds? Buffalo Discovery's 10- and 15-year annual average returns ranked among the top 3% and 2% of Morningstar midcap growth funds.In 2017, Buffalo Discovery returned 25.4%. It earned a top-three ranking in the IBD Best Mutual Funds 2018 Awards list for midcap funds.Innovation is essential for inclusion in the Buffalo Discovery portfolio. ""We've found that our focus on innovation is one of the best ways to hitch our wagon to share gainers and market disrupters,"" Carlsen said. ""We believe these companies will be the most likely to reap the rewards of the big secular growth trends.""Carlsen's team uses secular trends to home in on worthy portfolio candidates. ""The secular trends provide a growth tailwind and narrow our stock picking universe to a durable growth universe that we believe should grow faster and have less cyclicality than the overall market,"" he said. ""Our growth universe establishes our hunting grounds, not the constituents of a benchmark index. This purposely distances us from relative benchmark portfolio management styles leading to high active share.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Buffalo Discovery team looks for companies that can gain market share in almost any market environment. ""We let our innovators run,"" Carlsen said. ""We have a preference for small- and midcap stocks with long runways for growth where the benefits of innovation are sustainable and early relative to the potential opportunity, resulting in high rates of growth for many years.""Buffalo Discovery owned 86 stock holdings and maintained an annual turnover ratio of 53% as of Dec. 31. Technology, industrials and health care were its three largest sector weightings.Top holding Align Technology has been a mainstay in the portfolio for much of Carlsen's tenure. The stock has surged more than 4,000% since the maker of Invisalign was added to the portfolio in 2005, and has climbed into large-cap territory. The Buffalo Discovery team still sees plenty of room to run. ""We believe robust growth is sustainable over the intermediate to long term,"" Carlsen said. ""Less than 15% of the orthodontic market has converted from metal braces to clear aligners. The company has also been focused on driving down the cost of its product resulting in tremendous growth internationally.""In Q4, Invisalign case shipments spiked 34% on a year-over-year basis.Carlsen sees the fund's stake in Nevro (NVRO) benefiting from an aging population and a government push away from opioids for pain management. ""The company makes high-frequency spinal cord stimulation (SCS) devices that treat chronic back and leg pain more effectively and with better clinical outcomes than competing SCS devices from traditional players,"" he said. ""It has rapidly gained nearly 15% market share and remains well positioned for further share gains and rapid growth. Continued product innovation like smaller footprint devices should expand the market and recent full-body MRI approval in Europe bodes well for future U.S. approval.""Xylem (XYL), the No. 2 holding of the fund, enables municipal and industrial customers to manage water systems more efficiently. ""They've incorporated sensors and analytics to proactively provide alerts when a problem requires attention, before it breaks and causes costly downtime,"" Carlsen said. ""They have also incorporated intelligence on pumps to use less energy and boost efficiency. The company should have earnings growth in the midteens over the next several years.""Shares of Xylem are up 50% from a year ago.In the tech space, the Buffalo Discovery team is bullish on the video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA). ""Video game companies have enjoyed a strong year as investors realize the positive business model effects of downloadable games and in-game content,"" Carlsen said. ""Emerging online player networks should help further expand the user base as players connect from around the world.""Electronic Arts has seen its stock price rise 43% over the past year.Buffalo Discovery bought shares of Praxair (PX) in 2015. The industrial gas supplier was a top 10 holding at year-end. ""It is a premier operator and serves a consumable (product) to a diverse set of industrial customers,"" Carlsen said. ""This tends to insulate it from negative flash points in the economy. Its strategy is to grow profitably regardless of the macroeconomic environment. The name brings some nice stability to our portfolio.""Shares of Praxair are up 31% versus a year ago.With an eye on its current holdings, the Buffalo Discovery team remains on the lookout for opportunities to add innovators to the portfolio.""We believe the market frequently overreacts to near-term events, which will create opportunities to buy premier stocks at attractive prices,"" Carlsen said.""The market volatility experienced this past February is the most recent example. Only through active management can an investor benefit from these temporary market dislocations. Anyone can ride an index fund or ETF up during the bull market, but you need the skill of an active manager to protect your capital when the tide turns.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Read The Full IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards 2018 Special ReportHere's The List Of The Best Mutual Funds Award Winners By CategoryBest Mutual Funds: News, Performance Reports And Investing IdeasHow To Invest Like Fidelity Stock Gurus Will Danoff And John RothWhich Stocks Are The Best Mutual Funds Buying — And Selling?

15,XYL,"Investors will find quite a few leading stocks in Fidelity Trend Fund (FTRNX), but it's taken more than just owning the likes of Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook for fund manager Dan Kelley to keep his fund apace or ahead of peers and the stock market.Much of the fund's success can be traced to what goes on behind closed doors: depth of research, fund manager experience, investment philosophy and the timing of buys and sells.And Kelley's views about several of his top holdings, appearing below, reveal a good deal about his plan of attack for beating the market.The $1.6 billion large-cap growth fund was up 3.43% year to date, through Wednesday, well ahead of its peers' 1.7%, and a bit behind the S&P 500's 6.52%. But its long-term track record is also looking good: Average returns over the past three, five and 10 years amount to 9.05%, 13.88% and 8.54%, respectively. The S&P 500 turned in 9.0%, 13.91% and 6.68% for those periods.IBD's TAKE: Stock holdings of top-performing mutual funds are a great place to look for investment ideas. But before buying any, you should thoroughly analyze them using such tools as IBD Stock Checkup.Fidelity Trend is also an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Award-winner, having beaten the S&P 500 in the past one, three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31.Kelley, the fund's manager since 2012 and with Fidelity since 2005, says Trend's main differentiating factor is it selects stocks with mispriced growth. ""I don't really care as much about how fast the growth is, I care about what I'm paying for the rate of growth.""As a result, he likes ""being paid twice, with both positive earnings revisions and a valuation re-rating if I'm right on those positive earnings revisions."" Estimated P-Es of stocks are adjusted lower when expected earnings are revised upward. This improves the attractiveness of such stocks.Kelley segments growth stocks into three buckets: quality, secular and opportunistic growers. Quality growth companies have proven management teams, stable earnings-growth profiles and strong balance sheets. Examples include Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL) and Visa (V).Secular growers ""are companies where I get a little discomfort in the valuation on near-term numbers, but they have the ability to grow at a very high organic growth rate for quite some time, and usually for longer than the market expects."" Salesforce.com (CRM) and Facebook (FB) fall in this category.Asked for his view on top holding Apple (AAPL), which just reported fiscal Q4 earnings and its first decline in annual profit in 15 years, Kelley said he could only comment on the situation as of the fund's last filing, Aug. 31.""In general, Apple needs to continue to innovate further on the smartphone for customer demand to remain high and earnings to grow,"" he said. ""The smartphone has become the most important device in most people's lives as the average person checks in 100 times a day. Hence, Apple needs to continue to provide customers with the best user experience, leading operating performance, and exciting new features to drive growth.""On Amazon (AMZN), he said the company, as of the fund's latest filing, still looked cheap vs. its long-term growth potential. ""What has changed from prior years, is the market has come to further appreciate the Amazon Web Services business and the long-term opportunity for that business, both from a revenue growth and earnings potential,"" he said. ""In addition, with respect to the core retail business, more retailers have embraced Amazon as a powerful distribution platform, which has allowed the company to operate more as a marketplace and enhanced the company's margin profile.""The third bucket includes opportunistic growth companies such as Williams Cos. (WMB). ""Those are companies that tend to trade at cheap valuations due to some concern — whether it be a cyclical company and the market gets worried about excess capacity, whether it be some sort of company-specific issue — and those names usually have the highest probability of being re-rated once we see some positive change,"" he explained.In the case of American natural-gas producer Williams, Kelley says that once they didn't get acquired, they started to make some corporate governance moves — changing the board and reducing their risk profile — which led to a re-rating of their stock.""Williams stock increased 28% in price from the end of July through Sept. 30,"" Kelley noted. ""It was the second-biggest contributor to fund performance during 3Q16. Before owning WMB, the fund had a preference to hold WPZ (Williams Partners (WPZ), a Williams affiliate), which also benefited from some of the same de-risking and commitment to balance-sheet improvement that Williams did.As a general rule, Kelley tries not to take huge sector bets. However, earlier in the year he did allocate about a 500 basis point overweight vs. the fund's Russell 1000 Growth index benchmark in the energy sector, which significantly contributed to the fund's performance.As to the three buckets, he usually lets the market dictate where the most compelling value is. That said, the quality bucket has probably been the largest one over time, comprising about 60% of the fund.Metal-packaging maker Ball (BLL) and water-pump and valve producer Xylem (XYL) both strongly contributed to last quarter's fund performance.Xylem has pulled back 9% from its early October peak and has fallen below its 50-day moving average.Kelley's take: ""While I can't comment on specific market moves that have happened since our latest public holdings disclosure, I think it's important to note that I take a long-term perspective when making investments on behalf of fund shareholders and look to take advantage of possible short-term market dislocations.""Global food-and-ketchup manufacturer Kraft Heinz (KHC) is a company that may have low organic growth and a high multiple, but it has a management team that are great capital allocators, points out Kelley. ""When they combined Kraft and Heinz, they took out a lot of cost. ... the management are really known to be really good operators of companies and they can go in and run them much leaner than they were run before. And so, what's happened historically, is that the synergies from these large-scale acquisitions had been much greater than initially expected.""RELATED:Amazon, Facebook, Alibaba Drive USAA Growth FundWhy A Top Columbia Fund Likes These Stock Leaders

19,XYL,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Xylem Inc. (XYL  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Xylem is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for XYL in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 77 cents per share for XYL, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 76 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for XYL, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.65% heading into earnings season.Xylem Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Xylem Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Xylem Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that XYL has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Xylem, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

20,XYL,"The equity universe has been witnessing an upward trend, of late, recording gains of 2.4%, 3% and 3.4% for the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow Jones Industrial Average, respectively, over the last three months.An improving U.S. economy will likely bring to the forefront some winners across the market this year. However, speculations regarding a probable inflation spike (due to outstanding growth in U.S. wage rates) and a subsequent hike in interest rates remains a cause of concern.Consequently, investors must not invest in typical bets without a clear roadmap.Among the numerous potential gainers, adding Xylem Inc. (XYL  -  Free Report) to your portfolio would likely be a promising move.Over the last month, shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have gained 4.6%, as against the 4.2% loss incurred by the industry. Notably, the attractiveness of this stock as a current investment choice is further accentuated by its favorable VGM Score  B.Reasons for the Bullish RunTop-Line Prospects: Xylem reported better-than-expected revenues in fourth-quarter 2017. Revenues improved 7% year over year on an organic basis. From end-market’s perspective, sturdy public utility, commercial and residential demand bolstered revenues during the reported quarter. Xylem believes the improving Water Infrastructure, Applied Water and Measurement & Control Solutions segments’ performances will prove conducive to revenue growth.Water Infrastructure results will gain from sturdier water transport and dewatering business. In addition, stronger industrial, commercial and residential applications businesses will improve the Applied Water segment’s performance. Moreover, Xylem believes solid analytics, gas, solutions, software and services business will reinforce performance of the Measurement & Control Solutions segment in the near term.For 2018, the company anticipates to generate revenues in the range of $5.1-$5.2 billion (estimating organic revenue growth of 4-6%). Margin Growth: Xylem’s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin expanded 40 basis points (bps) in the fourth quarter 2017. The company noted that this upswing was primarily driven on the back of healthy performance of Sensus analytics business and ongoing productivity initiatives.Notably, the company realized $148 million cost savings and a remarkable amount of volume leverage from its productivity initiatives. The company expects to widen its EBITDA margin by 70-100 basis points and secure cost savings of $160 million in 2018.Business Buyouts: Xylem perceives that strategic business acquisitions will boost its competency in the quarters ahead. The company successfully acquired Pure Technologies on Jan 31, 2018, in a bid to reinforce its progressive infrastructure analytics business. Xylem believes this buyout will open up new opportunities for its business and boost shareholders’ value as well.Notably, the Pure Technologies acquisition is anticipated to drive the company’s revenues by 2% in 2018. Additionally, the buyout of premium stormwater and sewer analytics company — EmNet (January 2018) — is anticipated to fortify Xylem’s analytics business arm in the quarters ahead.Liquidity: Xylem has been steadily boosting its free cash flow on the back of working capital improvements across all businesses and the robust Sensus business operating performance. In fourth-quarter 2017, the company’s free cash flow improved 58% year over year.During the quarter, the company financed new capital expenditure programs, provided dividends and repaid debt with these proceeds. Xylem claims that better working capital management will continue to boost its liquidity over time. Upward Estimate Revisions: Over the past 7 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Xylem moved 3.6% upward to $2.91 and 4.3% to $3.36 for 2018 and 2019, respectively.The positive earnings estimate revision indicates upbeat sentiments and substantiates the Zacks Rank #2 for this stock.The stock’s projected earnings per share (EPS) growth rate for 2018 and 2019 is pegged at 20.4% and 15.2%, respectively.Other Stocks to Consider Some other top-ranked stocks in the same space are listed below:Colfax Corp.

21,XYL,"Every week the government and other entities release economic reports that cover all areas of the economy - from retail sales to housing, to international trade to consumer sentiment.In fact, on virtually any given day there could be anywhere from one to a handful of reports.And while the financial media does cover them, they usually focus on headline numbers without doing a deeper dive.This is unfortunate because within these reports often exists money-making details that can quickly be uncovered with just an extra few minutes of reading.For example, in the Employment Situation report, it details what sectors saw the most new jobs or labor force expansion, and which ones contracted.I can remember countless times where that report got me into the right sectors and industries at the right time before anybody else was talking about them.In fact, I still remember getting into housing in early 2012 while everybody else was staying as far away from it as possible. But, after seeing construction jobs continue to rise in report after report after report, I knew the housing market had turned. And that was one of the first alerts to the housing recovery - for those who knew where to look.But the headline number and the obligatory one-or-two-sentence write ups on many news sites missed the best part of the story by not going the extra mile (or paragraph).Well here we are again, with more stock-picking insight, straight from last week's Employment Situation report. Last week it showed that some of the biggest job creation came from these four industries:1) Construction: +36,000(up 226,000 over the last 12 months)2) Food Services & Drinking Places: +31,000(up 255,000 over the last 12 months)3) Health Care: +21,000(up 288,000 over the last 12 months)4) Manufacturing: +15,000(up 186,000 over the last 12 months)Once these reports point you in the right direction, you can then plug in the appropriate sectors and industries to capitalize on this information and find the best stocks within those groups.This is just one very specific way to do top down analysis. But you can go to any screener (like the one on Zacks.com or the Research Wizard) and locate the sector, then industry of interest.Then you should add in your favorite and most successful stock-picking criteria to drill down to the best ones, such as Zacks Rank 1s or 2s (Strong Buys or Buys); market-beating growth rates; below industry valuations; upward earnings estimate revisions, etc.Here are 4 stocks from some of the industries singled out as the biggest job creators in last week's Employment report:(MDC  -  Free Report) M.D.C. Holdings(Construction)(RUTH  -  Free Report) Ruth’s Hospitality Group(Food Services & Drinking Places)(MEDP  -  Free Report) Medpace Holdings(Health Care)(XYL  -  Free Report) Xylem(Manufacturing)Profitable stock ideas can come at any time and any place. But instead of waiting for the next great stock to fall into your lap, you can actively search for them.

26,XYL,"On Jan 8, we issued an updated research report on premium diversified machinery company Xylem Inc. (XYL  -  Free Report).Over the last six months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock yielded a return of 27.5%, outperforming 15.4% growth recorded by the industry.Existing ScenarioXylem believes that robust public utility sector demand as well as stronger industrial end-market business will drive its top-line growth in the quarters ahead. Moreover, elevated sales from residential and commercial end markets are anticipated to bolster its revenues. Notably, the company estimates organic revenues to grow in the range of 3-4% in the fourth quarter.Moreover, Xylem aims to boost its financials on the back of diligent business acquisitions. In this context, the acquisition of Tideland Signal Corporation (February 2016), as well as Sensus and Visenti businesses (October 2016) are worth mentioning. Notably, considering the benefits of the Sensus and Visenti acquisition, Xylem anticipates organic revenue growth rate in the band of 4-6% by 2020. Also, the latest Pure Technologies buyout (December 2017) will likely drive the company’s results and smart water portfolio.In addition, backed by the ongoing lean initiatives, Xylem intends to secure increased cost savings and offset the adverse impact of inflation in the near term. Notably, it intends to finance new research and development investments, and also offer increased returns to shareholders with increased liquidity.However, Xylem’s business largely depends on third-party suppliers, as well as commodity and contract manufacturing market conditions. The company accrues different types of components, raw materials and input parts from these entities. If these third-party suppliers are unable to provide the required materials on time, then Xylem will face severe supply-chain challenges going forward.Moreover, adverse climatic conditions, such as heavy floods and droughts, might give rise to operational challenges.Greater internationalization exposes Xylem to political, environmental, economic and legal headwinds. For instance, adverse foreign currency translation impact reduced the company's earnings per share for the first nine months of 2017 by 2 cents. A stronger U.S. dollar enhanced the competitive power of smaller companies based in low-cost nations, thereby hurting Xylem's results. Notably, further appreciation of the U.S. currency is expected to dent the company's financials in the quarters ahead.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space are listed below:Atlas Copco AB (ATLKY  -  Free Report) currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

27,XYL,"In the current market scenario with changing customer preferences and habits, evolving needs, demographic changes and an extremely competitive environment, maintaining steady sales growth is the key to survival for any business. Companies are always looking for ways to boost their marketing initiatives to drive sales.Revenues are often more closely monitored than earnings at the time of assessing the growth of a business. It’s worth keeping in mind that in cases when companies incur a loss, albeit transitorily, they are valued on their revenues, as top-line growth (or decline) is usually an indicator of a company’s future performance. Therefore, the Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio can turn out to be a suitable metric for stock valuation. It remains a key stock selection criteria keeping in mind that management usually has limited opportunities to tamper with revenues as they can with earnings. Thus, the P/S ratio is subject to lesser manipulation than the Price-to-Earnings ratio.  Sales growth in isolation is, however, not enough. Consideration of a company’s cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments.Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the 16 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Bethesda, MD, Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) operates, franchises, and licenses hotels and timeshare properties.

28,XYL,"Investors looking for stocks in the Manufacturing - General Industrial sector might want to consider either Wolseley (FERGD  -  Free Report) or Xylem (XYL  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Right now, Wolseley is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Xylem has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that FERGD is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.FERGD currently has a forward P/E ratio of 17.62, while XYL has a forward P/E of 23.96. We also note that FERGD has a PEG ratio of 1.06. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. XYL currently has a PEG ratio of 1.33.Another notable valuation metric for FERGD is its P/B ratio of 4.17. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, XYL has a P/B of 4.88.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to FERGD's Value grade of A and XYL's Value grade of D.FERGD stands above XYL thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that FERGD is the superior value option right now.

Total earnings for these companies (accounting for 64.2% of the index’s total market capitalization) are up 8.7% year over year on 6.7% higher revenues, with 75.7% beating earnings estimates and 66.2% surpassing top-line expectations. Based on the hitherto observed pattern, the Q3 reported cycle has been robust so far!Industrial stocks have been in investors’ good graces, of late, driven by impressive factors such as elevated rebuilding activities (thanks to two major hurricanes), an upbeat job market picture, as well as recovery of the Chinese economic conditions.We note that the Industrial Products sector is currently placed at the top 44% out of the 16 Zacks Sectors. This sector has also been outperforming the S&P 500 market in recent times. In three months’ time, the sector has recorded around 5.3% growth, above the S&P 500 index’s growth of 4.3%. As of Oct 27, we project that earnings and revenues of all the Industrial stocks in the S&P 500 Group would climb 18% and 4.2%, respectively, year over year.What’s in Store for These 3 Industrial Stocks?AGCO Corporation (AGCO  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter results before the market opens. The company pulled off an impressive average positive earnings surprise of 39.70% over the last four quarters.In second-quarter 2017, the company’s earnings of $1.15 per share topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.6%. However, we cannot conclusively predict that AGCO Corporation will likely beat estimates in this quarter. That is because a stock should have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as we will see below.AGCO Corporation’s Earnings ESP is -3.77%, as the Most Accurate estimate of 70 cents comes below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 72 cents.

39,XYL,"A few industrial products companies are gearing up to report quarterly numbers on Aug 1. The Q2 earnings season is in full swing, with about 286 S&P 500 companies having already reported results, reconfirming broad-based expectations of better-than-expected earnings (as on Jul 28).Earnings of these companies (accounting for 68.8% of the index’s total market capitalization) are up 11.3% on 6.1% higher revenues. Of these companies, 74.5% have surpassed earnings estimates, with 69.2% coming ahead of revenue estimates.As per our latest Earnings Preview, dated Jul 28, data projects that the total earnings for the S&P 500 companies are now on track to grow an impressive 9.2% from the year-ago period, on 5% higher revenues. This is comparable to earnings growth expectations of 5.6% recorded at the beginning of the reporting season.The Industrial Products space (which accounts for about 2% of the S&P 500 index’s total market capitalization) is anticipated to chart one of the highest earnings growth rates this quarter amongst all Zacks sectors. In fact, its earnings are on track to be up 17.6% in the quarter, on 13.8% higher sales compared with the last year.Industrial products stocks have performed well in second-quarter 2017, with the industry gaining roughly 4.7%, outperforming the S&P 500’s rally of 2.7% (Apr 1 to Jun 30). We believe that growth-conducive policies of the government and expectations of higher infrastructure spending drove the shares’ performance.Further, there are economic indicators which point toward a strong operating environment for the industry. Industrial production — which measures the level of output of manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors — grew at an annual rate of 4.7% in the second quarter, led by robust growth in mining and utilities. Additionally, new orders for U.S.-manufactured machinery rose 4.6% in the first five months of 2017, largely for the construction, mining and oil and gas field machinery. These indicators bode well for the industry.Let’s have a look at how some industrial companies are positioned, ahead of their scheduled announcements tomorrow:Emerson Electric Company (EMR  -  Free Report) is engaged principally in the worldwide design, manufacture, and sale of a broad range of electrical, electromechanical and electronic products and systems. The company has a modest earnings surprise history, having beaten estimates twice in the trailing four quarters, for an average positive surprise of 4.3%. In the last reported quarter, the company reported in-line earnings.Our quantitative model hints at an earnings beat for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company in Q2. This is because it has an Earnings ESP of +2.94% (the Most Accurate estimate of 70 cents being higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents), in addition to the favorable Zacks Rank.(For more details, read: Emerson to Report Q3 Earnings: Is a Beat in Store?).For a possible earnings beat, the company should have the right combination of two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1(Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3. It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Emerson Electric Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Emerson Electric Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Emerson Electric Company QuoteSimilarly, we expect Eaton Corporation, PLC (ETN  -  Free Report) to outperform estimates when it reports quarterly results tomorrow. The power management company has a decent earnings surprise history, having beaten estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters, for an average positive surprise of 3.3%. In the last reported quarter, the company surpassed estimates by 10.3%.A favorable rank and positive Earnings ESP hint toward an earnings beat this season for the company.For the to-be-reported quarter, the company’s Earnings ESP of +1.72% and a favorable Zacks Rank #3 indicate that Eaton Corporation’s earnings will likely beat estimates this quarter. Its Most Accurate estimate of $1.18 is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.16.

In the last reported quarter, the company missed estimates by 5.1%.We do not expect Xylem to beat expectations this quarter.

41,XYL,"The first-quarter earnings season is in full swing with around 267 S&P 500 companies already having reported financial numbers till Apr 27. Total earnings for these companies are up 25.1% year over year on 10% higher revenues, with 76.8% beating earnings estimates and 73.8% surpassing top-line expectations. Based on the hitherto observed pattern, the first quarter is anticipated to register improvement in earnings and revenues.  Per the latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to rise 22.6% on 8.4% revenue growth, the highest quarterly earnings growth rate in the last seven years. This represents better growth projections from the previous quarter — courtesy of a corporate tax overhaul and relatively healthy job data.Given the ongoing healthy scenario, it is quite natural that most sectors should deliver an impressive performance. In fact, per the above report, 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors are projected to end the first quarter with double-digit earnings growth on a year-over-year basis. Only the Autos are expected to end the quarter with bottom line decline.One of these well-performing sectors is Industrial Products sector. According to the latest report, total first-quarter earnings of the sector participants are likely to increase 35.4% from the same period last year on 15.4% higher revenues.Currently, the sector seems to have regained its momentum after struggling with reduced investment in the energy sector, soft commodity prices as well as poor economic conditions in some developed and developing nations over the last few years. The rebound can be attributed to increased infrastructure spending as well as rise in manufacturing and mining activity.Given this backdrop, it will be interesting to wait and see how some of the Industrial stocks fare when the companies release their results on May 1.Emerson Electric Co. (EMR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results before the opening bell.

44,XYL,"Xylem Inc.

The average four-quarter earnings surprise is a negative 0.02%. In the last reported quarter, its earnings of 76 cents came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to PlayStronger smart-meter business, sturdier analytics sales, higher light industrial markets’ demand, ongoing government investments in water infrastructure projects, and recovering mining as well as energy market conditions are expected to drive Xylem’s top-line performance in the first quarter. The company also believes strategic project wins, product launches, acquisition benefits and favorable exchange rates will aid in boosting its revenues in the quarters ahead.From end-markets’ perspective, public utility and industrial end-market sales will likely mark highest growth in Europe and the United States, in the near future. However, robust industrial sales in the emerging countries, like India and China, will likely be offset by softness in Latin-American industrial revenues. Commercial end-market sales will likely be the strongest in China and India. Also, residential end-market revenues are predicted to improve in China and the Asia Pacific but will likely face stiff competition in the United States in the near term.Xylem anticipates to record year-over-year revenue growth of 5-6% in the first quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of first-quarter revenues for the company’s Applied Water segment is currently pegged at $365 million, lower than $333 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of first-quarter revenues for the company’s Water Infrastructure segment is currently pegged at $464 million, lower than $496 million recorded in the year-earlier quarter.Ongoing commercial initiatives, greater operational excellence, elevated volumes, high margins secured from acquired businesses, and reduced corporate taxes are expected to have favorably impacted Xylem’s profitability in the to-be-reported quarter. Nevertheless, persistence of headwinds like unfavorable revenue mix, input-cost inflation and expenses relating to the ongoing product-localization investments might have depressed the company’s bottom-line performance in the quarter.Xylem anticipates to record adjusted operating margin of 11.3%-11.5% in the first quarter. However, the company noted that the Pure Technologies buyout (February 2017) will dilute its earnings per share by a penny, in the quarter to be reported.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of first-quarter adjusted operating income of Xylem’s Applied Water and Water Infrastructure segments are currently pegged at $53 million and $55 million, respectively, lower than $61 million and $103 million recorded in the last quarter.Earnings WhispersXylem’s favorable Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), when combined with an Earnings ESP of -0.10%, makes surprise predictions inconclusive.Xylem Inc.

45,XYL,"On Mar 5, we issued an updated research report on Terex Corporation (TEX  -  Free Report). The company is anticipated to benefit from its focus on strategic priorities, product development, disciplined capital allocation strategy, strong backlog and cost-saving initiatives. However, the recent imposition of tariffs on steel imports is likely to lead to raw material inflation for the equipment manufacturer catering to the construction, infrastructure, and surface mining industries. Improving Backlog Signals Upbeat Performance in 2018 Terex’s fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings soared a whopping 230% year over year to 33 cents per share. Increased operating margins, bookings and backlog in every segment led to the overall improved performance in the quarter. For the fourth quarter in a row, Terex’s backlog grew year over year in every segment. Its total segment backlog grew 56% at 2017 end. This along with an improving global market environment positions the company well for 2018. Terex anticipates net sales to be up around 10% year over year in 2018. For the year, EBITDA is projected to lie between $385 million and $415 million, approximately 40-50% higher than 2017, driven by strong operational performance. Effective tax rate in 2018 will be approximately 23%, an improvement of about 400 basis points (bps), of which 300 bps relate to the new U.S. reform. The company projects 2018 earnings per share of between $2.35 and $2.65. The mid-point of the guidance reflects year-over-year growth of 85%. From a quarterly perspective, the company expects a normal historical sales pattern and earnings per share to be generated roughly 15% in first quarter, 35% in second, 30% in third and 20% in fourth. Northward Estimates Reflect Optimism The Zacks Consensus Estimate for both fiscal 2018 and 2019 has undergone positive revisions following the strong results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 has gone up by 10% while the same for fiscal 2019 has moved up 7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is currently pegged at $2.52 for fiscal 2018 which reflects year-over-year growth of 87%. For fiscal 2019, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $3.21, year-over-year growth of 28%. Terex has a long-term expected earnings per share growth of 16%. Rising Cost Headwinds, Steel Tariffs a Woe   Terex’s margin outlook is tempered by pricing and steel cost headwinds. If steel prices continue to rise from current levels, then the company apprehends that 2018 earnings will come in near the lower end of its guidance range. Terex has underperformed its industry with respect to price performance in a year’s time. The stock has gained around 49%, while the industry has recorded growth of 16%.  Segments Poised for Growth Terex expects to increase revenues and operating margins in every business segment while continuing to implement the Simplify and Execute to Win elements of its strategy. Further, it intends to follow disciplined capital allocation strategy. In the Aerial Work Platforms segment, sales are projected to increase approximately 10% while operating margins will be between 9.5% and 10.5%. Improved markets, modest increase in pricing and continued escalation in manufacturing productivity is likely to drive results. The Cranes segment delivered the third consecutive quarter of positive operating profit. The global crane markets have stabilized and the company is witnessing pockets of growth, improving order rates and backlog. Terex plans to improve productivity on higher volumes and better operational execution, adding to benefits from the restructuring actions taken in 2017. It will continue to make significant year-over-year improvement with revenues and operating profit increasing 12% and 2%, respectively, in 2018. The Materials processing segment will continue its robust performance with sales up 8% operating margins between 11.5% and 12.5% aided by higher backlog and strength in its markets. Stronger demand for fluids material handlers and broad line of environmental products will also drive results. The Materials processing segment is investing in innovations and will continue to launch new products and services that improve customers' return-on-investments in 2018. Simplifying Structure to Fuel Growth The sales of the Material Handling & Port Solutions (“MHPS”) segment and the remaining construction businesses concluded the Focus element of the company’s strategy and created substantial value for shareholders. Terex continues to simplify its structure by footprint rationalization plan, exiting 12 manufacturing locations totaling 2.6 million square feet. The company also cut down administrative expenses while maintaining focus on increasing investment in innovation, strategic sourcing, and commercial excellence. Focus on Disciplined Capital Allocation Terex plans to follow its disciplined capital allocation strategy in 2018. The company projects to nearly double its free cash flow to approximately $100 million. Terex anticipates its gross financial leverage to go down to approximately 2.5 times at year-end. The company reiterated target to achieve 20% or greater ROIC by 2020. In 2017, ROIC was at 8% and is expected to improve to 15% in 2018. ROIC expansion values both operational improvement and significant improvements made to Terex’s capital structure. Terex carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks in the same sector include Mobile Mini, Inc. (MINI  -  Free Report), Capstone Turbine Corporation (CPST  -  Free Report) and Xylem Inc. (XYL  -  Free Report).

It also identifies certain risks of owning nVent ordinary shares. The separation and distribution of nVent ordinary shares is subject to the satisfaction of a number of customary conditions, which include the declaration that the Form 10 is effective by the SEC.   Able Leadership to Steer Toward Growth In October 2017, Pentair unveiled the name of the future Electrical company as nVent Electric plc and announced additional key leadership. Beth A. Wozniak, will assume the position of CEO of nVent upon completion of the separation. Also at the helm will be Stacy McMahan as Chief Financial Officer and Randall J.

48,XYL,"On Jul 9, we issued an updated research report on premium diversified machinery company, Xylem Inc. (XYL  -  Free Report). The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the stock’s earnings remained unchanged for both 2018 and 2019 at $2.89 and $3.37, respectively, reflecting neutral brokers’ sentiments.Let’s dig into the fundamental aspects influencing the performance of this stock.Existing Growth DriversXylem has been steadily enhancing its product portfolio on the back of the company’s value-added water solutions and leading-edge technological know-how. The company recorded organic growth of 4% in 2017 on the back of elevated demand from utilities, commercial, industrial and residential end-markets. Notably, its top line improved 7% year over year in first-quarter 2018.The company expects that stronger utility and industrial end-market’s demand, increased water infrastructure spending in emerging countries like India and superior customer relationships will bolster its revenues in the upcoming quarters. Xylem currently anticipates securing organic revenue growth of 4-6% in 2018. The company’s revenue guidance for this year currently lies in the $5.1-$5.2 billion range.Per our estimates, Xylem’s year-over-year revenue growth is currently pegged at 9.4% and 5.1% for 2018 and 2019, respectively.Xylem pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 1.27% over the last four quarters. The company has been steadily widening its margins backed by the ongoing productivity-enhancement programs and diligent cost-saving moves. Xylem anticipates to secure around $160 million cost savings in 2018. Also, the company’s operating margin for 2018 is predicted to expand by 60-100 basis points (bps).Per our estimates, Xylem’s year-over-year earnings growth is currently pegged at 20.4% and 16.4% for 2018 and 2019, respectively.We also expect that strategic business acquisitions will continue to drive Xylem’s revenues and profitability in the upcoming quarters. For instance, the acquisition of Pure Technologies (January 2018) has been reinforcing the company’s infrastructure analytics business. The company also expects this buyout to boost its revenue growth by 2% in 2018. Moreover, the EmNet and Valor Water acquisitions (February 2018) will likely continue to fortify Xylem's advanced analytics business in the quarters ahead.Causes of ConcernRising material cost, if unchecked, might weigh over Xylem's profitability in the upcoming quarters. The company’s cost of sales had escalated 23.6% and 2.7% in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Notably, in first-quarter of 2018, the company’s cost of revenues flared up 14.9% year over year, primarily on the back of material cost inflation. Notably, the company's gross margin shrunk 70 bps due to elevated cost of sales.Notably, on a P/E (TTM) basis, Xylem's stock looks a bit overvalued compared with the industry, with the respective tallies of 26.6x and 21.7x for the 12-month period. Also, the stock looks relatively more leveraged than the industry. Its debt/capital ratio is currently pegged at 0.5x, higher than 0.3x recorded by the industry.In addition, other headwinds like stiff industry rivalry or issues with third-party suppliers remain major risks for the company.Price PerformanceOver the past year, Xylem’s shares have rallied 22.3%, outperforming 2.6% growth recorded by the industry.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the industry are listed below:Chart Industries, Inc. (GTLS  -  Free Report) sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company’s earnings per share (EPS) are predicted to grow 26.9% for the next three to five years.

51,XYL,"Weakness in the technology sector as well as fears over the outcome of U.S.-China trade war pulled down the major U.S. indexes on the first trading day of April, though some recovery was witnessed a day later. These burning issues might influence investors’ view of the U.S. equity universe in the days ahead, especially for the companies in the tech sector.However, despite these near-term concerns, we believe that the country’s solid fundamentals and some recent policy changes will help in strengthening its prospects. The most impressive was the implementation of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act in December 2017. This measure will help improve liquidity of the corporates, enabling them to make additional investment in growth projects.Also, accelerating growth of the global economy — from 3.2% in 2016 to 3.7% in 2017 and 3.9% projected for 2018 by the International Monetary Fund — will support the country’s prospects. This premier institution expects the country to advance 2.7% in 2018 and 2.5% in 2019, reflecting hike of 0.4% for 2018 and 0.6% for 2019 from its earlier forecasts.Based on our in-house classifications, the U.S. equity stocks have been grouped under 16 broad sectors. Each sector is given a rank calculated on the basis of the average of Zacks Rank of all the companies within it.The Zacks Sector Rank of 1 is placed at the top, with the first eight sectors placed in the top half and the other eight in the bottom half.

53,XYL,"The U.S. economy has performed significantly well in the past five years, with its major stock indexes, including the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial surging 91.6% and 93.8% respectively. Its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded roughly 9.5% in these years, with a year-over-year expansion of 2.3% recorded for 2017.The future expansion projections issued by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also appear quite appealing. In its January 2018 report, IMF predicted that the U.S. economy will expand 2.7% in 2018 and 2.5% in 2019. These estimates reflect an improvement of 0.4% for 2018 and 0.6% for 2019 from its earlier growth forecasts. These alterations were primarily induced by the country’s tax policy changes as well as strong global growth momentum.Our in-house projections, published on the Earnings Trends report dated Mar 7, indicate roughly 20.7% growth in earnings and 7% increase in revenues of S&P 500 companies in 2018. This compares favorably with a growth rate of 7.1% for earnings and 5.9% for revenues recorded in 2017.Sector in FocusWe believe that investors keen on exposure to industrial companies have reasons to rejoice. Industrial Products, one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors, yielded a solid 35.2% return in the last five years. It currently holds the first position in the Zacks sectors list.The constituent electrical products industry is at the top of the 265 industries comprising the Zacks sectors while those dealing with construction and mining equipment, office supplies and uniform and related services are in the top 3%. Also, companies dealing with metal & glass containers are in the top 6%. Going by the Zacks methodology, companies in the top half of the 265 industries have greater chances of financial outperformance than the bottom half. (To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank)In 2018, the sector’s earnings are projected to grow 23.3% year over year on revenue expansion of 10.1%. Margins are likely to expand 1.12%. The growth for earnings and margins are higher than 15.1% and 0.37% respectively recorded in 2017, while that for revenue is below 2017-figure of 10.6%.In the next three to five years, earnings of the Industrial Products sector are projected to grow 10.7%.What’s in Store for Growth Investors?Operating conditions for the Industrial Products sector seems to have improved over time. A strengthening U.S. housing market, job additions and plans for investment in infrastructural improvement by the government are some positives. In addition, any effort aimed to improve trade relations with other nations will be a boon.Key economic indicators like an 11.4% rise in new orders for U.S.-manufactured machinery in January 2018, 4.4% year-over-year growth in industrial production in February and 2.9% month-over-month rise in the ISM Purchasing Managers’ Index or manufacturing index for February point toward healthy operating conditions in the industry.Also, lower taxes due to the implementation of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act in December 2017 are expected to free resources for the corporates, enabling them to make further investment in growth projects. However, the recently approved tariff on import of steel and aluminum might have certain adverse impacts in the form of competitive threats from international players and hike in cost of production.Despite the near-term hurdles, we believe that Industrial Products sector’s solid long-term growth potential represents a win-win situation for growth investors. Also, the industries within the sector are capital intensive and have a large gestation period for yielding returns in any projects. Per the Zacks Style Score system, a growth investment strategy zeroes in on stocks after analysing the company’s income statement, cash flow statement and balance sheet. Instead of paying shareholders regularly, the majority of the annual earnings are reinvested in the business for funding growth programs. These stocks reward shareholders with solid capital gains.Companies with favorable Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) are anticipated to yield solid returns, clearly outperforming the market.Suitable Growth Investment OptionsWe have zeroed in on five Industrial Products stocks with solid growth potential over the next three to five years and are worth investing in.H&E Equipment Services, Inc.

54,XYL,"When it comes to choosing stocks, investors often opt for complex investment strategies in a bid to book higher returns. But with ever changing market dynamics, this may not yield the desired results every time. Therefore, using conventional strategies, based on key fundamentals, to choose stocks is always a wise decision.One such strategy is sales growth. Maintaining steady sales growth is the key to survival for any business. Sales growth as such remains a vital measure for any corporate house, as it is important to growth projections and strategic decision making.So, when companies incur losses for a temporary period, they are valued based on their revenues, as top-line growth (or decline) is usually an indicator of a company’s future earnings performance. Also, in contrast to price to earnings and price to book value ratios, which can turn negative and cease to be relevant, price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is available even for companies that have hit choppy waters.Additionally, profits and book value are largely influenced by several factors including accounting decisions tied with depreciation, significant charges and inventory. However, management has limited opportunities to manipulate sales, which further underscores the importance of P/S ratio. Hence, P/S ratio can serve as a more reliable metric for stock valuation. Focusing solely on sales growth is, however, not enough.A consideration of a company’s cash position along with its sales can be a more dependable strategy. Significant cash in hand and steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments.Picking the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the 12 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in West Palm Beach, FL, Platform Specialty Products Corporation (PAH  -  Free Report) produces and sells specialty chemical products.
