0,ADS,"Baidu stock surged Monday as an investment bank upgraded shares of the Chinese search engine, but turned more cautious on Chinese internet services Alibaba Group (BABA) and Tencent Holdings (TCEHY).KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Hans Chung upgraded Baidu (BIDU) stock to overweight from sector weight. He sees ""near-term headwinds"" for Alibaba and Tencent. He kept his overweight rating on the three Chinese internet stocks.His quarterly review of the Chinese internet market left him incrementally more positive on fundamentals at Baidu. He set a price target on the stock at 305.Baidu stock jumped 4.1% to 261.97 on the stock market today. Alibaba rose 0.2% to 192.72, while Tencent popped 2.3% to 50.93.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

1,ADS,"The decision to sell a stock depends on your time frame. Where position trading looks at holding a stock for a couple of months, swing trading focuses on just a couple of weeks. The shorter trade requires more sensitive sell rules. That extra sensitivity led us to sell Alibaba stock on IBD's SwingTrader but hold Alibaba on IBD's Leaderboard.The traditional buy point on Alibaba (BABA) showed a 201.60 entry from a double-bottom base. An early entry presented itself as the stock hit resistance multiple times around 200. We added Alibaba to IBD's SwingTrader on May 25 as the price crossed that area, but it didn't hold above it by the close (1). The next day, Alibaba challenged the price level again but failed (2). With the market still trading flat, we took half the position off the table as a cautionary measure.A few days later, the stock recovered and cleared its traditional buy point (3). Buying the shares back would be an option at this point. The relative strength line cleared new highs more definitively (3) than at our original buy (1). But volume was a little light for a traditional breakout and the market was just starting to regain steam.Alibaba continued to make progress and reached our 5% profit goal as it crossed 210 (4). Normally, this would trigger our rule to sell half the position. In this case, since we only had a half position, it changed the math. That would leave us with a quarter-position size. It's hard to make much impact when your position size gets too small. You can also fall into the trap of ignoring losses because they are smaller and holding stocks longer than necessary. We decided to hold Alibaba early in the day for a 10% profit goal. We still raised our stop to 1% profit from our entry. But, we saw another bearish reversal (4) by the close leaving us less certain.The following day, Alibaba didn't participate in a strong market move and we removed the remaining shares around 208 (5). The change in character was enough to suggest that the stock might struggle over the next few days. That's not something you want to sit with in a swing trade. For a position trade, the decision could be different. That's why the stock stayed on IBD's Leaderboard at the time. Different sell rules apply to swing trades over position trades.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Leaderboard is already up over 21% year-to-date while the S&P 500's gain is under 4%. Alibaba is one of 11 stocks on the Leaders List. Trial subscriptions are available. The decision to sell Alibaba stock worked well for the swing trade. The next day it was down nearly 3% closing well below its 5-day moving average line (6). More than a week later and it's still trading around the same level as our sell. As for Leaderboard, the stock is still contributing to profits there. Its relative strength line is still holding up and Alibaba got support at its 10-day moving average line. Its fundamental story of retail dominance in China is compelling. The different sell decisions may prove to both be correct for their respective time frames.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Swing Trading Versus Position Trading: When To Take ProfitsWhich Moving Average Is Best For Profiting On Swing Trades Swing Trading Strategies And Lessons

3,ADS,"China's mainland stock markets ended their first week fully in bear market territory on Friday, as Shanghai joined Shenzhen in pulling back more than 20% from February highs.Chart damage across the landscape of China-based stocks trading in the U.S. was significant. Leaders including Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA), New Oriental Education & Technology (EDU) and Autohome (ATHM) stabbed below support in heavy trade. Others, like Baidu (BIDU) and YY Inc. (YY), also broke support but in weak trade and therefore inflicting less damage on their charts.For several, including Baozun (BZUN), iQiyi (IQ) and CLPS (CLPS), the week's losses may have been a positive.China markets have fallen largely in response to the trade brawl underway as the U.S. attempts to restructure its international trade agreements. The tit-for-tat threat of sanctions between the two countries, and similar skirmishes underway between the U.S. and various other trading partners, has created the kind of volatile environment that is hostile to investor confidence.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseVarious types of institutional investors seek shelter in safe havens that can include the dollar, the Japanese yen, gold and Treasury bonds. That flight to safety helps drive currencies such as China's yuan lower. After a tough week, the yuan staged a modest rebound on Friday. But it was still set for its largest monthly decline on record, losing about 3.3% of its value vs. the dollar in June, according to Reuters.China Shenzhen Composite entered a bear market on June 19, as it fell more than 20% below its November high. The Shanghai Composite slipped into bear territory on Tuesday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index pulled back to a Thursday low that was 15.8% below its January high. That left it well above the 20% drop that defines a bear market.In response, U.S. investors have backed away from China-based names as indicators suggest things may get worse before U.S. trade strategy begins to bear any real fruit. U.S.-based stocks with China exposure also continue to suffer. Caterpillar (CAT) dropped more than 10% in June. Deere (DE) fell more than 5%. Boeing (BA) held to a loss of less than 4%.But the declines may also produce some opportunities worth watching. Two of those are IPOs.IQiyi dropped almost 11% for the week, its second steep weekly decline. The divot looks severe. But the pullback marked its low at 34.6% below its June 19 high. That leaves it within the 35% boundary of what is usually considered to be a normal pullback for cup-type bases. The stock remained up 57% since clearing an IPO base in May. But it has yet to form a standard base.The chart for another IPO, Huya (HUYA), looked similar at the end of the week. The pullback from its high was 41%, however. That means any base it builds will be a risky bet at breakout time.Financial IT services provider CLPS may be ready to form a base. The stock has nearly doubled since clearing an IPO base in mid-June.Baozun pulled back more than 10% for the week, but managed to keep close to its 10-week moving average. The stock could shape a base, or it could rebound from support at its 10-week line. In either case, Baozun's last breakout was from a third-stage base.

4,ADS,"The bear market is back in China, but should that matter to U.S. investors? On Friday, the Shanghai Composite dropped to 20.9% off its Jan. 29 high. Traditionally a 20% decline is the definition of a bear market.IBD's Stock Spotlight screen offers a partial answer to the who-cares question. Going into Tuesday's session, only one China-based stock made the screen: Alibaba (BABA).Earlier this year, as the Shanghai peaked, as much as 25% of the Spotlight lineup was China-based stocks.Individual investors might argue that the 2015-16 bear market in China meant little to U.S. investors. From a peak in June 2015 to a low in January 2016, the Shanghai Composite lost about half of its value. Meanwhile, U.S. indexes dropped less than 10% in the same period.Still, a decline is nothing to cheer about, especially since circumstances today are different.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn the 2015-16 China bear market, the chief bearish driver was slowing economic growth in China. Now President Trump's trade war is the chief catalyst.Let's take a look at the nine China-based stocks that have made the Spotlight screen at least once this year. What can their relative absence tell us now?No. 1: Online marketplace Alibaba is 10% off its high, not bad vs. the Shanghai's 20% drop. Yet the stock lost its 10-week moving average Monday. China is trying to shift to a more consumer-based economy and Alibaba could benefit from those efforts.No. 2: Tutoring center operator TAL Education (TAL) has made the Spotlight screen for more weeks this year than any other China stock. But after hitting a new high June 12, the stock has fallen 21% off its high. The last few bases were late-stage patterns.No. 3: Express delivery provider ZTO Express (ZTO) is 9% off its high. Action appears normal, even positive. The 2016 IPO recently found support at its 10-week line. The up-down volume ratio is a bullish 2.1, above the neutral 1.0 level.No. 4: Hotel chain Huazhu Group (HTHT) is 11% off its high after trimming gains from its May 15 breakout. The relative strength line, which measures a stock's price movement vs. the S&P 500, is bending south.No. 5: Solar-related stock Daqo New Energy (DQ) is 51% off its high. Both the 10-week and 40-week lines have been lost.No. 6: Social networking platform Weibo (WB) is 35% off its high. It hasn't made the Spotlight screen since March.No. 7: E-commerce solutions provider Baozun (BZUN) is finding support at its 10-week line. This is the first trip to the line since Baozun broke out in May.No. 8: Online marketplace 58.com (WUBA) lost its 10-week line this week. The stock is 19% off its high.No. 9: Health care services company iKang Healthcare Group (KANG) is 1% off its high. The company has agreed to a merger.What can investors learn from the Spotlight lineup?Many of the above China-based stocks carry seriously damaged charts.ZTO's chart is probably the most promising for two reasons. First, it's newest to the Spotlight lineup, having appeared in two of the past four weeks. Second, it is holding above its 10-week line.ZTO could be a watch list candidate. If the Shanghai Composite can find a bottom and rise, and the U.S. indexes can shake off their problems, ZTO could become a winner.RELATED:Trump Threatens Harley-DavidsonIs Stock Market About To Relive 1930?Stocks That Are Showing Relative Strength?MarketSmith: 3 Weeks For $19.95

5,ADS,"When top stocks break out, it's important to manage your expectations. Some stocks advance immediately and lead to solid gains, like Twitter (TWTR).

6,ADS,"Cutting losses quickly is critical to success in swing trading. You must have a set stop loss and the discipline to act if it hits. With China trade war headlines jostling stocks, you need to know where to put your stop loss for the protection it provides.Baozun (BZUN) had a lot to offer as a swing trade opportunity. It's a member of the computer enterprise software group, one of the top-performing groups of this year. Its last earnings report acted as a catalyst for a strong breakout (1), vaulting 20% move in the next few weeks. Rather than fretting over the missed opportunity in Baozun's move, you can look for a new opportunity in a pullback. In this case, a bullish reversal presented itself as the stock fell below 60 then powered back above it in a single day (2).Typically in a reversal, we look for the price to surpass the previous day's close to confirm the strength. The reversal day fell short in that regard. But the next day, the stock opened above the reversal day high and started making progress early in the trading day (3). Baozun joined IBD's SwingTrader at an early entry of 62.36. But before entering a trade, you need to determine where to put your stop loss.For reversals, we often look to the low of the reversal day as our stop loss. In this case, that would amount to an excessive risk for a swing trade at nearly 10%. Using the low of the entry day would normally be an acceptable alternative, but that was too tight.There seemed to be an area of support around 60 from a few weeks back on the daily chart and this matched up nicely with an area of support on the intraday chart. At over a 3% risk percentage it was on the higher side but still reasonable. You could also reduce the risk to your portfolio by adjusting your position size.Two days later, short-term market conditions worsened and Baozun hit our stop loss (4). It's not fun taking a loss, but it is a part of trading. Sure, by the end of the day the stock was above our stop loss but you don't know if it will come back when your stop loss triggers. You have to protect yourself from the loss potentially growing.The China trade war rhetoric continued the next week and Baozun fell 10% the day after we removed it from SwingTrader. It continued falling throughout the week. If you don't respect your stop loss, you set yourself up for devastating losses.It's bad enough that you reduce the capital in your portfolio. It means starting with less money for your next opportunity. But even worse is what a large loss can do to your emotional capital. You can get more timid at the next move, investing less or investing late. That's the hidden cost of big losses. Cut losses short, respect your stop losses and it will save you from a lot of costly mistakes.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED: What To Do When A Swing Trade Doesn't WorkCutting Losses Quickly Is Key To Long-Term Stock ProfitsSwing Trading Strategies And Lessons

12,ADS,"An investor who had bought all 10 of IBD's Global Leader stocks listed on Dec. 29 would have, as of Tuesday, a 10.3% profit.That is well above the S&P 500, but a tad behind the Nasdaq's 10.9% increase over the same period. All in all, it's an uninspiring performance for profit-seeking investors.But what if you had followed CAN SLIM rules and only bought stocks at valid buy points? That strategy would immediately knock off what turned out to be the two worst performers on the final Global Leaders list of 2017. Both were Argentina-based names. Grupo Financiero Galacia (GGAL) is down 27% for the year through Tuesday. Grupo Supervielle (SUPV) showed a 34% loss. Neither entered buy zones before starting their sell-offs.Eliminate those two and the year-to-date average for the remaining eight stocks jumps to 20.5%. But that is misleading. Some stocks didn't reach buy points for a while. Others on the list saw breakouts fail and triggered sell rules, before later recovering.CAN SLIM rules further pared the list by eliminating two China-based names. YY Inc. (YY) failed to form a proper base before beginning its sell-off in January. New Oriental Education (EDU) topped a buy point, but in such weak trade that it left doubts about the breakout.That left a total of five of the 10 Global Leaders that moved into buy ranges either late last year or in January. Two of those five breakouts, Alibaba Group (BABA) and China Lodging (HTHT), quickly failed and triggered automatic sell rules.But the CAN SLIM method would have caught and held onto the breakout of Autohome (ATHM) on Jan. 2. The stock was up 63% from the 67.79 buy point on Wednesday.The list's other big gainer, Atlassian (TEAM), would've been harder to hold. It broke out Jan. 16, but triggered a sell rule four weeks later. Investors had two chances to buy back in, as the stock retook that buy point in heavy volume in late February and early March. The stock was 26% above that entry on Wednesday.The average for the five stocks that passed buy points late last year and in January gives an average gain of 16.1%. That assumes a 7% loss for each of the two failed breakouts. In addition, it's probably safe to assume most investors would've sold India-based bank HDFC (HDB), as the stock lagged through the first quarter. A sale at the early March low of 95.05 would've produced a loss of 5%.That lowers the performance of the five ""buy"" stocks to 14.8%.But a CAN SLIM investor would also have followed some of the stocks into subsequent buys. Michael Kors (KORS) never quite reached its buy point in April. The stock immediately weakened, underscoring the importance of not buying before a buy point.China Lodging topped a 41.65 buy point in a cup base on May 15. It traded about 17% above the entry Wednesday. Two weeks later, IBD Leaderboard investors closely followed Alibaba's June 1 breakout above a 201.60 buy point. It gained as much as 4% but has erased the entire gain.That means an investor who opened $5,000 positions on each of the five ""buy""stocks early in the year would now have grown those to $28,700. Also, that same investor could have invested cash freed from the early Alibaba, China Lodging and HDFC sales (minus 7% each for Alibaba and China Lodging, minus 5% for HDFC) in new positions.If the full $14,050 from those sales were invested, 50% in Alibaba and 50% in China Lodging, it would've grown to $14,963.It's not a knockout profit, but the simple strategy produced a combined total of $29,613 — an 18.5% gain. That comfortably outclasses the Nasdaq's 11.4% year to date gain through Wednesday, not to mention the S&P 500's 3.6% increase.Acacia, Lumentum Gain As U.S. To Lift Ban On ZTE Component SalesThe Robot Revolution Is Here, And Medicine Is Embracing ItAutohome Stock 'Ascends' Into Buy Zone Via This Rare, Bullish BaseAtlassian Bulls Focus On Customer Growth, Product InvestmentsChinese Stocks: Latest News & Analysis

Meanwhile, Huya extended its gains Friday, though it backed well off its intraday high. At one point Friday, the stock was extended as much as 40% from its 10-day moving average.When a stock becomes 20% extended from its 10-day moving average, that's usually when pullbacks are seen.

Bilibili and iQiyi both debuted in late March.And Huya, a livestreaming platform for gaming in China, went public on May 11 as a spinoff of YY (YY), which is also a livestreaming company. The stock has yet to take an official breather, never forming a proper IPO base along its run. Shares have risen 285% from the IPO price of 12.As iQiyi, Bilibili and Huya are young names in China's growing internet marketplace, their growth stories still seem to be in the early stages. Huya is turning profitable, while Bilibili is expected to be profitable soon. And all three of these China stocks have already seen strong revenue growth. Looking at stocks that are in the early stages of growth is key to scoring big gains.China's Momo, which went public in December 2014, is well extended from its last proper buy point.

23,ADS,"The cup-with-handle chart pattern is to serious investors what the single is to a baseball fan. It's the starting point for scoring runs and winning the investing game.Among the eight principal base patterns — including the flat base, double bottom, saucer, base on base, ascending base, IPO base, and high, tight flag — the cup with handle remains to this day one of the most successful.Why? Simple. Over the centuries, human nature hasn't changed. Greed, fear, hope, despair and other emotions drive stock prices. So do the laws of supply and demand.This is why sifting through the charts of the market's greatest winners is time well worth spent.As you'll see, the general shape of the cup with handle and other critical chart patterns appear over and over again. That's why they give the prepared investor an edge in the stock market. (You can sift through more than a century of history among the greatest stock market winners by going to the fourth edition of William O'Neil's classic, ""How To Make Money In Stocks,"" and studying Chapter 1.)So let's dissect this base. This is something you should know inside out. You need to know if that cup with handle is as it should be, or if it has flaws.The stock needs to show a 30% uptrend from any price point, but it must be before the base's construction. Or, the stock must show a minimum 20% increase from a prior breakout.The cup with handle must be at least seven weeks long. If there is no handle, then the cup itself must stretch a minimum six weeks.The handle alone needs at least five days to form, but it could go on for weeks. Make sure it doesn't exceed the cup portion in time or size of decline. A good cup with handle should truly look like the silhouette of a nicely formed tea cup. The handle always shows a smaller decline from high to low; it represents a final shakeout of uncommitted holders, sending those shares into sturdier hands in the market.In most cases, the decline from high to low should not exceed 8% to 12%. During bear markets, some good cup with handle bases show a large, double-digit decline within the handle. But again, it should not exceed the drop within the cup.The handle usually begins with a down day in price. Be aware that the handle itself, which must stretch for a minimum five trading sessions, can morph into a base of its own in certain cases. That's not a problem; it's often a stock's way of offering a buy point that's clearer or lower than that suggested by the larger pattern.The handle should form in the upper part of the entire pattern. If it's too low, it's flawed.One way to check if that handle is proper: use the simple midpoint test. Add the highest price and lowest price within the handle and divide by 2. That number should be greater than the midpoint of the actual base itself.Let's take the cup with handle fashioned by Baidu (BIDU) (see the chart below) in 2007. In the cup base, the high was 134.10 and the low was 92.80. Add the two prices together and divide by 2 and you get a base midpoint of 113.45. The handle showed a high of 132.80 and a low of 120.25, and its midpoint of 126.53 easily exceeded the cup's midpoint.The handle should also show a downward slope along at least a portion of its price lows, not an upward one.An upward-sloping handle is flawed; it represents weak demand as new buyers move into the stock at a trickling pace. During the stock's actual breakout, you want to see a new wave of buyers coming in at a torrid pace, not a trickling one.Also, a steep, high-volume decline should put you on alert. You don't want to buy a stock that institutional investors couldn't wait to unload at any price.The cup should form smoothly, without major price declines on the left side. Sharp gains on the right side aren't necessarily good, either. You might think that the opposite of a panic-driven exit would be a good thing. Likely not.Try to limit your picks to cups that are no more than 30% or 33% deep, except for those built during a bear market. In that case, an exceptional growth stock can fall 40%, 50% or more and still make a successful breakout.Still, shallower is better. It shows that the big hands are catching the stock.Look for volume to dry up along the lows of the base. Volume should be light in the handle, too.Tighter price action is better. This is true of almost all bases. A loose, choppy base shows the stock needs to go far for price discovery. If institutions are holding on to the stock, it won't fall too far.This, of course, is where all the above parameters lead if they appear correctly. The buy point from a cup-with-handle base appears at the highest point of the handle, plus 10 cents. In the case of former big winner Baidu, the proper buy point during its May 14, 2007, breakout was 132.90, a dime above the handle's intraday high of 132.80.Less than six months later, the leading Chinese web search engine rocketed to 428, up 222%.Even if all other parameters come together, you should avoid stocks that break out below their 10-week moving average.Also, when the stock is breaking out, you should generally see a rush in turnover. Volume should ideally rise at least 40% above its 50-day average. For small and midcap stocks, expect breakout volume to double or triple.The daily and weekly charts at both Investors.com and MarketSmith make heavy turnover easy to spot. Simply compare the day or week's volume with the moving average line drawn across the volume bars. An Investors.com chart will also tell you in real time how volume is running in comparison with typical level at that time of the trading session.For the weekly chart, the moving-average line traces 10 weeks' worth of turnover.What should you do if volume on breakout day is much lighter than usual? Sometimes volume will pick up in the next few sessions. Light volume in the market in general may also be a factor. Also consider that the breakout may have started later in the day.O'Neil has often said at past IBD seminars that after a stock breaks out, he wants to see weekly volume rise vs. the prior week. This signifies a sudden shift in demand for shares that could continue to build up.Are quarterly results coming up? If so, traders often hesitate before the news. But if the stock fails to make much headway in price, the relative strength line is fading, and the market itself is not showing positive action then something may be wrong with the timing of the breakout.At that point, it makes sense to exit the stock, even if the 7%-8% loss-cutting sell rule has not yet been triggered.(Editor's Note: A version of this column was first published in the July 9, 2010, edition of IBD.

Shares of Galapagos tumbled 3.8%, to 92.18, though AbbVie stock lifted 0.3%, to 92.69. Broadly, biotech stocks rose about 1.5%.Galapagos tested its drug, GLPG2737, as a cystic fibrosis treatment for patients with a specific genetic mutation. The patients had already received Vertex's drug, Orkambi. But Galapagos' goal of showing its drug could be part of a triple-regimen in cystic fibrosis fell short.At day 28, patients treated with GLPG2737 showed a 3.4% improvement in lung function over those who received the placebo. That failed to hit statistical significance. It also trailed Vertex's data for its drugs VX-659 and VX-445, which showed benefits of 10%-11% and 12%-14%, respectively.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

""With Vertex already advancing into Phase 3 pivotal studies with their triple regimens, we see few competitors that will be able to challenge Vertex in the near/intermediate term.""Chico kept her outperform rating on the biotech company's stock.An improvement of 10% vs. the placebo would have been competitive, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said in a report. GLPG2737 is also being tested as part of a triple-regimen containing a pair of other drugs from Galapagos. But Divan is now bearish on that study, called Falcon.Thursday's ""data raises significant concerns about Falcon and the competitiveness of the entire (cystic fibrosis) franchise,"" he said.Galapagos is partnered with AbbVie on its cystic fibrosis efforts. But AbbVie is ""taking a knee in"" cystic fibrosis, Raymond James' Chico noted. In a press release, Galapagos said AbbVie decided not to proceed with a previously contemplated second triple-regimen therapy.Now, ""Galapagos is reviewing the future of its CF (cystic fibrosis) collaboration with AbbVie,"" the biotech company said in its release.The data release from Galapagos removes a major overhang on Vertex stock, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said in a report. He expects Vertex to be ""the dominant (cystic fibrosis) player for the foreseeable future.""Abrahams expects the biotech company to hit out-year cystic fibrosis treatment sales of about $7.5 billion and $15 per share in earnings. He has a 202 price target on Vertex stock.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges has a 175 price target on Vertex. He noted Galapagos' cystic fibrosis treatment resulted in a sweat chloride reduction that was also materially lower than Vertex's results in its experimental triple-regimens. Sweat chloride is an indicator of cystic fibrosis.""None of this is particularly surprising to us,"" he said in a report.

28,ADS,"Dow Jones futures were little changed late Thursday, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. President Donald Trump has approved a revised China tariffs list, according to multiple reports. Adobe Systems (ADBE) topped earnings views and guided higher, but its stock fell. AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX) rose late as the Justice Department won't seek to stay Tuesday's court ruling blessing their merger. Meanwhile, red-hot Chinese livestreaming IPOs iQiyi (IQ), Huya (HUYA) and Bilibili (BILI) extended big gains from the regular session.During the regular session, the Nasdaq composite rallied strongly to a new high, fueled by strong gains in FANG stocks such as Netflix (NFLX) and Facebook (FB), with software and internet IPOs (including iQiyi, Huay and Bilibili) continuing to shine. The S&P 500 index rose slightly, while the Dow Jones industrial average dipped as energy and retail stocks slumped.Dow Jones futures were essentially flat vs. fair value. So were S&P 500 futures. Nasdaq 100 futures climbed a fraction.President Donald Trump reportedly has approved tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods, with a revised list affected products. The official announcement will come Friday, though it's not clear when the tariffs will go into effect.

The IBD 50 stock also guided higher for the current Q3.Despite the seemingly positive news, Adobe stock fell 3.4% in late trade. That action offers three lessons for investors.Don't buy an extended stock: Adobe has run up 38.5% since its January breakout. The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has consistently hit new highs. While Adobe could keep running, it would not be surprising to see Adobe pull back for a short period or consolidate over a period of weeks or months.Be cautious about buying a stock into earnings: Earnings reports are high risk, high reward. A strong report can send a stock soaring, but huge losses are also possible. Adobe's after-hours action is relatively muted give the stock's recent run. But investors should consider buying call options to minimize the downside risk while reaping any upside gains.Don't trust after-hours action: Whether it's Adobe stock or Dow Jones futures, overnight action doesn't always translate into trading in the next regular session. Perhaps Adobe will pull back modestly on Friday. But the stock could show a sharper loss or close with a gain.The Justice Department won't seek a stay to Tuesday night's federal court ruling. That would let the AT&T-Time Warner merger close, though the DOJ later could appeal the ruling itself. Time Warner stock rose 2% after hours. AT&T stock edged higher.During the regular session, Baidu (BIDU) spinoff iQiyi ran up nearly 17%, YY (YY) spinoff Huya jumped 13%, and Bilibili climbed 2.1%.

30,ADS,"China growth stocks withered and Wall Street felt more selling pressure Wednesday as concerns over potential tariffs imposed on goods between the U.S. and its trading partners weighed on stocks today. The Nasdaq composite led with 1.5% decline, while the S&P 500 dropped almost 0.9%.Volume rose on both exchanges, according to early data. That signaled strong propensity among mutual funds, hedge funds, banks, insurers and the like to anxiously sell equities and raise cash.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) almost resisted the overall decline, edging less than 0.2% lower and outperforming the market. The relative strength has come at an important time. Earlier this week, the iPhone and iPad giant sold off hard and closed beneath its 50-day moving average for the first time in nearly two months.At 184.16, the megacap tech remains mildly above a 179.04 entry in a narrow and shallow double-bottom base. Therefore, for now, this is one reason why the leading tech stock can still be held by those who bought at the most recent proper buy point.The Dow Jones industrial average performed relatively better, losing just 0.7%, while the small-cap S&P 600 slid 1.4%. Yet at 1018, the S&P 600's 8.9% advance since Jan. 1 still sharply outperforms a less than 1% gain for the S&P 500.Breadth was severely negative as losing stocks outmatched winners on the Nasdaq by a 4-1 ratio. On the NYSE, losers beat winners by a 5-2 margin.Meanwhile, crude oil jumped sharply. U.S. near-term futures gaining 2.6% to $72.38 a barrel. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury yield dropped 6 basis points to 2.82%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

At 28,356, the Hang Seng is now down 5.2% year to date.Sector Leader play Baozun (BZUN) slumped more than 7% and sliced through its 50-day moving average in heavy turnover. The stock gave back all of a solid double-digit gain after breaking out of a seven-week base at 52.43.Baidu (BIDU) slumped for a fifth day in six sessions, falling more than 3% to 243.10 and closing back below the long-term 200-day moving average.Since the start of the year, the Chinese search engine has traced a series of higher highs and higher lows, but the severe choppiness has made it difficult for investors who have tried to buy Baidu shares on a breakout.Baidu announced plans to buy back as much as $1 billion worth of its common shares. The company's market value is nearly $85 billion.Plenty of other Chinese growth stocks got hammered.Autohome (ATHM), a former Leaderboard name, sharply undercut its 50-day moving average and issued a key defensive sell signal. Shares fell nearly 8% to 97.51 in volume that grew 169% above average.The 50-day moving average, painted as a red line in IBD's daily charts, had contained no fewer than five pullbacks by Autohome since early February.Therefore, Wednesday's big cut of the 50-day line showed a bearish change in character in the leading stock.The online marketing firm for the Chinese vehicle market had vaulted out of a double-bottom base at 66.55 on Jan. 2. It ultimately rallied 79% before sliding into its current price correction.Apple has not made much price progress compared with 2017, when it cleared a cup with handle at 118.12 on Jan. 6 of that year. That cup with handle was not only first stage, but also served as a bottoming-base chart pattern after the stock's lengthy decline. Shares have risen 64% since then.However, the stock has continued to trace a slow yet steady uptrend while finding buying support at the key 10- and 40-week moving averages.Plus, the fundamental picture still looks bright. Earnings in the June-ending fiscal third quarter are forecast to grow 31% to $2.18 a share. That would mark acceleration from EPS gains of 2%, 11%, 18%, 24%, 16% and 30% in the prior six quarters.On Wednesday, Reuters reported that Apple and arch rival Samsung of South Korea settled a years-long technology patent infringement suit in a U.S. district court in Northern California. Terms were not disclosed in the court filing.Also, earlier this week, the Economic Times of India reported that Apple plans to boost production of certain iPhone models in the South Asian country in a bid to lower costs.According to IBD Stock Checkup, Apple's SMR Rating has risen to a top-drawer A grade on a scale of A to E. This proprietary rating focuses on sales growth, profit margins, and return on equity.A handful of companies staged breakouts, but their finishes lacked oomph.Kemet (KEM), part of the IBD 50, attempted a breakout from a long, deep cup with handle that showed a 25.79 buy point. Shares got as high as a 3.7% gain to 26.33 before cooling off and falling 15 cents to 25.23. Volume jumped 54% above usual levels.The drop within Kemet's cup base, a 49.8% slide from a 27.35 high to 13.73 at the bottom, is way more than the acceptable limit of 33% to 35% corrections in a normal cup with handle.However, keep in mind that the stock ramped up from as low as 1.26 in early 2016, a 2,070% gain until it carved the latest base. In some cases, a leading stock can build such a deep base, break out properly, and keep running to new highs.Outstanding fundamentals going forward usually factor into the story.Kemet, an expert in capacitors for electronics manufacturers, has grown its earnings per share 44%, 175%, 250%, 450%, 246%, 373% and 221% vs. year-ago levels in the past seven quarters.That kind of blistering growth is not likely to continue. But the Street sees earnings in the fiscal first-quarter ending in June rising a healthy 39% to 46 cents a share.Despite Wednesday's negative reversal, Kemet hasn't yet triggered the golden rule of investing.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on growth stocks, buy points, breakouts, sell signals, and financial markets.)RELATED:This Key Tech Sector Flashes Big WarningThe Stock Market Gets A Bloody Nose; Watch For This Key Sell SignalThe Latest Inside Investor's CornerSector LeadersCan You Spot The Next Major Market Top?

31,ADS,"Baozun, a May 2015 new issue, has waged a terrific run-up ever since it cleared a super-deep bottoming base at 9.99 during the week ended Aug. 26, 2016. How long can its rally last?And more importantly, how much impact could the China-U.S. trade dispute have on the company's fundamentals?To answer the first question, it's really key to learn how to count bases.After a stock breaks out of a sound chart pattern, watch to see if rises 20% or more. If it does, the next serious decline begins the process of a new base.What if a stock rises just 15% from the proper buy point, then settles into a new base? Put another way: You find a stock that launches out of a cup with handle, breaks out, goes up 15%, but then forms a flat base on top of that cup? In most cases, both bases count as one entire base. IBD calls it simply a base on base.Going back to Baozun (BZUN), the stock nearly doubled in price and hit all-time highs after that first breakout in 2016. Base No. 2 was also quite deep, but Baozun cleared a 17.68 entry during the week ended May 5, 2017. That breakout spawned a 130% advance.Baozun formed two more bases, one from September 2017 and another from March 2018. These two bases showed big weekly price swings. But the breakout from these bases showed hefty volume, a good sign.Some late-stage breakouts can work, even if there's higher risk of failure, when a company has truly excellent fundamentals and solid institutional sponsorship.This week, the stock has fallen to the 10-week moving average for the first time since its May 17 breakout. A first or second rebound off the 10-week line offers investors a fresh opportunity to buy shares. Risk is higher now with the market's outlook downgraded by IBD on Monday to ""uptrend under pressure.""During a rally off the 10-week line, look for a swell in turnover. A strong price gain in heavy volume signals solid institutional demand. Try to buy as close as possible to the 10-week line, or in this case, near 55.70.Contrast Baozun's action to fellow Sector Leader ServiceNow (NOW). The latter dropped briefly below its 50-day moving average on Friday, then closed beneath the line on Monday. Volume hasn't been overly intense, however. On Monday, ServiceNow saw trading volume increase merely 3% above average.To answer the second question, on the U.S.-China trade dispute, it's key to study recent numbers.Baozun, the expert in e-commerce markets in the second largest economy, has superior earnings gains. According to IBD Leaderboard, the average EPS increase over the past three quarters is 58%. The Street sees earnings rising 27% in the second quarter.In Q1, the Shanghai-based firm reported a profit 0f 9 cents per share, a penny above the consensus forecast. Revenue has jumped 24%, 19%, 31% and 25% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters.According to a May 17 news release, Baozun said the number of its brand partners rose to 156 as of March 31 from 125 the same time a year earlier. Officials do not make clear how many of those partners are American corporations. One can surmise that many of its brand partners are East Asian companies. For instance, Baozun established a wholly owned subsidiary in October 2014 to expand its e-commerce services to the Taiwan market.In October 2015, Baozun started a 100%-owned unit aiming to introduce more Japanese brands to Chinese consumers. And in September 2016, it launched a joint venture with a division of the South Korean culture and lifestyle conglomerate CJ Group ""to introduce highly sought-after Korean brands to Chinese consumers,"" according to a filing with the SEC.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:The Bull Market Gets A Bloody Nose; Watch For This Critical Sell Signal5 Reasons Why This Market Uptrend Is Still StrongThe Latest Inside Investor's Corner: This Should Happen On Breakout DayHow Many Chinese Companies Make The IBD 50 Today?

U.S. crude oil futures were mostly unchanged at around $68.55 a barrel.In stock market results today, defensive sectors such as food and utilities outperformed. Steel, mining and database-software firms lagged. So did networking firms and oil drillers.In the IBD 50, China stocks fell the most, with names like Momo (MOMO), Huazhu (HTHT), Alibaba (BABA) and YY (YY) down around 6%.Current holders of Momo who bought at the last breakout over 40.55 have reason to lock in partial, if not full, profits.Alibaba, meanwhile, gave up support at the 50-day moving average.

It wasn't booted until it made a distinct break of that line, which teaches investors the importance of judging action at the 10-week line properly.The Chinese internet company, sometimes called the Craigslist of China, was added to Leaderboard on July 10 (1). At the time, the stock was breaking out of a cup without handle in double its usual volume. The base was well-crafted, with no wild price swings and a symmetrical outline.The stock closed slightly below the 47.48 buy point on the day of the breakout, but the next day it finished business above it. From that point on, shares never looked back. 58.com kept adding gains apace.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn Aug. 21, the company reported quarterly earnings. With some cushion from the entry, we decided to keep the stock through the report. The cushion would help absorb losses if results sparked a sell-off. Instead, shares soared more than 20% on the earnings announcement, widening the profit from the buy point.Some of the gains were wiped out in a Sept. 25 sell-off (2). But 58.com held at the 10-week and 50-day moving averages. That was a signal to continue holding. In fact, the show of support became a follow-on buy area for investors to add some shares and enhance their returns. Indeed, the stock quickly bounced back.By late October it was back to the 10-week line. This time, 58.com traded below the line, something that had not occurred in the entire run (3). Still, it was a modest drop below the moving average, and on Halloween the stock was right back above the line.In early December, a similar harmless pullback occurred (4). Yet there was something different this time. 58.com took longer to rebound, and a five-week cuplike pattern was actually an improper base. The stock managed to make some gains, but the peak was coming into focus.On Feb. 2, the stock closed the week down 15% and below the 10-week moving average (5). Notably, volume was 52% above average for the week. When a stock closes the week below the 10-week line in weekly volume at least 40% above average, that's a sell signal — one that had not appeared in earlier pullbacks.Conscious that 58.com was well past a standard 25% gain from the buy point, Leaderboard editors decided to remove the stock from the Leaders list. The profit from the breakout was more than 55%.Since then, 58.com has stalled. The stock broke out of another base on April 30, and was added back to the Leaders list at that time. But it was removed about three weeks later due to slack price action.With Leaderboard, investors can get the needed guidance, as market specialists study the selected stocks and annotate charts with the latest signals.

Along with iQiyi stock's huge advance and being well-extended from the 10-day moving average, that action suggests a short-term pullback is likely.That could give investors a reason to book some profits.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhile iQiyi is growing fast, it's losing money. Its IPO filing showed 50.8 million subscribers — and losses of $574.4 million in 2017 on $2.67 billion in revenue.Per-share losses will continue for the foreseeable future, analysts say, narrowing from $7.80 this year and $6.48 in 2019, per Zacks Investment Research.The stock's fundamentals bear watching. Its IBD Composite Rating is a solid 90. But it has a lowly EPS Rating of 39 out of a best-possible 99.IQiyi also faces tough competition in China, primarily from Tencent (TCEHY) Video and the Alibaba (BABA)-owned Youku Tudou, reports say. But in a testament to its growth potential, Netflix struck a licensing deal last year, making some Netflix original shows available on the streaming service.Netflix also will reportedly acquire Chinese-language content from iQiyi and Youku Tudou.Huya, which is a video game livestreaming giant, has tripled since its May IPO at 12. Huya stock also is extended from its 10-day line. Huya fell 0.5% to 36.22 after setting a record 37.61 intraday.Bilibili, a youth-oriented online media platform, has also run in short order after its recent debut at 11.50. The stock hasn't run up quite as fast as iQiyi and Huya and is closer to its fast-rising 10-day line. Bilibili stock climbed 1.3% to 18.66.Momo blasted out of a long consolidation in late May and has continued to rally.

37,ADS,"If you follow the Investor's Business Daily analysis of the stock market closely, you know that a significant shift took place this past Monday.The Nasdaq composite got hammered by sellers on June 25, falling 2.1% in heavy turnover. That sell-off, combined with a dearth of impressive breakouts lately and a large load of distribution days (or significant declines in higher turnover), sent IBD's Market Pulse outlook in The Big Picture column one notch down to ""uptrend under pressure.""The outlook change doesn't mean you must sell the top dogs in your portfolio. View the new status as a yellow light on a traffic signal. Don't come to a full stop. Proceed with caution. But as the IBD 50 shows, if you hold many superior growth stocks, then you likely felt the heat of institutional selling a lot more than your neighbor who exclusively trades index ETFs.Major indexes showed nice rebounds on Thursday and through Friday afternoon trade. The S&P 500 cut its weekly loss to less than 0.6%. But companies in the IBD 50 shaved off a lot more of their recent gains. Twenty names, or 40% of the entire list, slumped more than 3% for the week through Thursday's close. Only Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN), ZTO Express (ZTO) and Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) and two more gained 2% or more.If you bought a true leader early in its run and your paper profit has topped 50%, 100%, or more, then you have the luxury of choices. If the stock is correcting in normal fashion, you might keep the entire position and wait for it to break out again. Or you might sell some shares, and give the rest a chance to grow more. A third option? Sell the entire position. Sit on the cash until you find a new royal opportunity.But what if your post-breakout gain runs in the 10% to 25% range? If you didn't take at least partial profits on the way up, then consider deciding where to draw the line in the sand.One of the most relevant sell rules: Don't let a double-digit gain turn into a loss. To go from, say, a 28% gain to an 8% loss not only hurts your portfolio; it can damage your personal investing psychology. If you come away with a single- or small double-digit gain, you can always buy back shares when the market shows better action.Momo (MOMO) illustrates how the 10-day moving average could help investors keep most of the advance after a May 18 breakout.At first, the move above a 40.55 buy point in an eight-week cup base was dull. But six sessions later, the Chinese social media play roared like a lion. It gapped up 15% in heavy volume on superb Q1 results (EPS up 57% to 69 cents, revenue up 64% to $435.1 million). Nine trading days later, the gain from 40.55 to a new high of 54.24 gushed up to 33%. A great profit.Besides selling on the way up once the stock hits the 20%-25% profit zone? Look for a sharp undercut of the short-term 10-day moving average. Momo did just that on June 19, falling 3.8% to 51.09. The 10-day line stood at a lofty 52.09, well above the 50-day moving average's value of 41.18. Sell at the June 19 close, and you would have locked in a 26% profit. (The 10-day line is not plotted on IBD Charts but is available in MarketSmith.)Momo's cup was lodged inside a larger, much deeper base. The stock has a penchant for making really big moves, really fast. So the recent waterfall slide to 41.44, just 2% above the 40.55 breakout point, should not come as a big surprise.All daily charts in IBD Leaderboard show the 10-day moving average as a green line.You can trade the IBD 50 in just one transaction with the Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) exchange-traded fund, managed by Innovator Capital.

45,ADS,"Dow futures rose modestly Tuesday morning, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. The Dow Jones led another solid stock market advance Monday, with the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite also strong following Friday's big rally. But quality breakouts were scarce. Monday's big winners tended to be recent laggards, including Dow Jones components Caterpillar (CAT), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) as well as recent China livestreaming IPOs Huya (HUYA) and iQiyi (IQ).The lack of breakouts is somewhat surprising. Friday's post-jobs-report, post-China-tariffs surge triggered a shift in IBD's market direction back to confirmed uptrend. Given that stocks, even leading stocks, tend to follow the major averages, you'd expect to see some new breakouts. The Nasdaq composite is just below last month's record high, while the S&P 500 index is just below a four-month best, near a handle-like formation. The Dow Jones reclaimed its 50-day moving average Monday.There are some quality stocks working on buy points. Marathon Oil (MRO) and EOG Resources (EOG) are among the many energy stocks closing in on breakouts.

53,ADS,"China's Shanghai Composite peaked in October 2007. So did the U.S. stock market. Unlike the U.S. stock indexes, though, the Shanghai never regained its peak.The Shanghai Composite is down 48% since Oct. 31, 2007. Compare that to the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, which respectively gained 167% and 78% in the same period.Initial public offerings have an advantage in these kinds of situations. They don't carry the baggage, the old scars and the overhead supply that the suffering stocks deal with.Instead, three recent China IPOs enjoy a place in the Sector Leaders list, a powerful IBD screen with the most stringent criteria.Online marketplace Alibaba (BABA) launched its IPO on the NYSE on Sept. 19, 2014. The stock immediately began to consolidate.A consolidation is exactly what an IBD-style investor wants to see in an IPO. Alibaba formed an IPO base (which can be shorter than normal) and scored a 20% gain in a couple of weeks.The next base was a long time coming. In August 2016, the stock completed a base and broke out. More consolidations and breakouts followed.Going into Tuesday's session, Alibaba was in the 5% buy zone from a recent breakout. The pattern, though, is late stage.The gain from the Sept. 19, 2014 close: 122%.Social networking provider Momo (MOMO) launched its IPO on Dec. 11, 2014. An early base and breakout gained 13%. Then the stock formed a series of consolidations.In December 2017, the low in a consolidation undercut the low in the previous base, which reset the base count to first stage. The stock is too extended to buy.The gain from the Dec. 11, 2014 close: 191%.E-commerce solutions provider Baozun (BZUN) launched its IPO on May 21, 2015 with an IPO price of 10.The going was initially tough. Baozun did not shape a base above $10 a share until October 2016 through May 2017. But then things turned up. Baozun eventually delivered three post-breakout gains of 117%, 28% and so far 21% after its most recent breakout.Admittedly some of the price progress came in a choppy fashion, making the stock tough to hold.The gain from IPO's May 21, 2015 close: 505%.A bear market will weigh on everything. But recent IPOs that skipped the tough years, and debuted in a friendlier phase, have better prospects.RELATED:IBD's Stock Of The DayBest Marijuana StocksIPOs Can Result In Rich Gains

54,ADS,"In the African country of Nigeria, oil wells may be flowing again, but the country's largest operator says attacks continue to put a brake on output.""Security in parts of the Niger delta remains a major concern with persisting incidents of criminality, kidnapping and vandalism as well as onshore and offshore piracy,"" said Igo Weli, general manager for external relations at Royal Dutch Shell's (RDSA) local unit. The warning underlines the enduring threat of attacks even as production recovers from a major militant campaign in 2016.Shell declared force majeure on Bonny Light crude shipments last month following pipeline leaks, while loadings of Forcados exports were also delayed. Weli didn't specifically link those incidents to his comments on vandalism.Militant assaults on Nigeria's oil infrastructure in 2016 cut the country's output to less than 1.4 million barrels a day, the lowest in 27 years. While there hasn't been a major attack since, the security situation in the oil region remains fluid, according to Weli.""Facilities operated by both indigenous and international oil companies continue to be vandalized by attacks and other illegal activities such as crude-oil theft,"" he said by email. ""We are continuing to monitor the situation to mitigate any exposure and minimize risks faced by our personnel.""Shell pumped an average of 631,000 barrels a day in Nigeria last year, about a third of the nation's production. Despite the rally in output, the company still counted 60 cases of sabotage and theft, compared with 49 the year before. There were 10 such incidents recorded in the first two months of 2018, according to Weli.Nigeria is scheduled to load at least 1.8 million barrels a day next month. That equals the production cap it agreed on with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which took effect in January.RELATED:Which Energy Sector Stocks Have A Spot In The IBD 50?

Huya, a YY (YY) spinoff, plunged nearly 14%. Both are sharply higher over the past several weeks. IQiyi stock and Huya stock had vaulted far above their fast-rising 10-day moving averages, so they were due for a pullback. On Thursday, Huya fell below its 10-day line for the first time ever, while iQiyi ended just above that line.Livestreaming is booming in China, and Huya has turned profitable. However, even if the future is bright for the livestreaming business, that's no guarantee that these two IPO stocks will be among the big long-term winners.If you are confident in these stocks, you might hold tight. Otherwise, you could trim or cash out your position.Huya stock fell 8% Friday morning, closing down 6.5%.

72,ADS,"Biotech giant Celgene (CELG) could win big after U.S. patent officials shut down a challenge facing Novartis' (NVS) multiple sclerosis drug Gilenya, analysts said Thursday.On Wednesday, an appeals board of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office upheld a patent protecting Novartis' Gilenya until December 2027. This extends Gilenya's exclusivity well past a prior August 2019 expiration date, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said.While undoubtedly a win for Novartis, the decision also has implications for fellow multiple sclerosis drugmakers Celgene and Biogen (BIIB), he said in a report. Celgene recently suffered a delay for its multiple sclerosis drug, ozanimod.This gives Celgene more time to get approval for ozanimod — which is currently hamstrung by questions from the Food and Drug Administration — before a generic Gilenya comes out and begins to take share, he said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""For Celgene, this should provide a better ozanimod launch runway especially after their (new drug application) filing delay, and give Biogen less medium-term price/share compression risk for its MS franchise, particularly for (its drug called) Tecfidera,"" he said.On the stock market today, Celgene jumped 2.7%, to close at 85.60. Novartis advanced 3.4%, ending the session at 78.94. Biogen rose 1%, to 347.66.Generic competition in multiple sclerosis is already underway. In October, Mylan (MYL) gained approval for a generic version of Teva Pharmaceutical's (TEVA) multiple sclerosis drug, Copaxone. In the first quarter, Teva said its U.S. sales of Copaxone declined 40% year over year.The same could happen for Novartis' Gilenya if generics arrive. Despite the patent appeals board decision, generic rivals will likely appeal, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said. Gilenya could still lose patent protection at some point in 2022-24 depending on appeals.""In summary, ozanimod will no longer be launching vs. a generic Gilenya in 2019,"" he said in a report to clients. ""This gives ozanimod at least a three-year window to launch in a branded market and establish presence in MS.""RBC's Abrahams noted Celgene could benefit to the tune of $200 million in upside depending on the length of the delay for generic Gilenya.Ozanimod is meant to be a safer version of Gilenya. Both belong to a class of drugs called sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator, or S1P modulators. Gilenya is tied to heart rate and liver issues.

Micron stock fell 5.5% on Tuesday after Taiwanese rival United Microelectronics (UMC) announced that it won a patent-infringement lawsuit against Micron in China.On Thursday, though, Micron shares climbed 2.6% to 52.84 on the stock market today.The Fuzhou Intermediate People's Court in Fujian province, China, imposed a preliminary injunction against Micron's subsidiaries in the country.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe affected products make up slightly more than 1% of Micron's annual revenue, the Boise, Idaho-based company said in a news release. Micron reiterated its previous revenue guidance for the current quarter of $8 billion to $8.4 billion. The company said it will comply with the ruling while requesting the Fuzhou court to reconsider or stay its decision.""Micron is disappointed with the ruling by the Fuzhou Intermediate People's Court,"" Micron General Counsel Joel Poppen said in a prepared statement. ""We strongly believe that the patents are invalid and that Micron's products do not infringe the patents.""The Fuzhou court issued the preliminary ruling before allowing Micron a chance to present its defense, Poppen said.

The claims also came in response to Micron's lawsuit against UMC and Jinhua in the U.S. District Court in California's Northern District. Micron claimed its trade secrets were misappropriated by the two companies.China might restrict Micron from participating in that country's market, says BMO Capital Markets analyst Ambrish Srivastava.

83,ADS,"For individual investors who trade Chinese stocks on U.S. exchanges, which index has the most influence on a stock? Is it the Shanghai Composite, the Hong Kong Hang Seng or the S&P 500?That's a tough question to answer because elite, China-based stocks have followed their own drumbeat this year. For example, Alibaba (BABA) is up 14% year to date.Meanwhile, the indexes in Shanghai, Hong Kong and the U.S. have been downright stingy.Year to date, the Shanghai Composite is down 3%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng is up 4%, while the S&P 500 is up 2%.Despite the small gains in the indexes, action has been kind of wild.After reaching a high in late January, the Shanghai Composite dived 15.2% and then rebounded to 10% off its high. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index made similar tracks, retreating 13% before rebounding to 6% off its high.The S&P 500 moved in like fashion, though not as sharply drawn. The S&P 500 lost 11.8% and rebounded to 4% off its high.In the context of price action, Alibaba has corrected as much as 19%. Yet, Alibaba's consolidation looks more disciplined than the indexes.The stock has fluctuated within a W-shaped, double-bottom pattern.Still, it would've been better if Alibaba had pulled back a bit more than 19%. The stock then could've undercut the previous low, which would've reset the base count.Does that sound freakishly technical?In IBD-style investing it's important to remember what's behind the rule. When sellers drive a stock underneath the previous low, they are demonstrating that they are weak holders, fearfully eager to get out of the stock. Their departure, once digested, gives the stock a better shot at success.But when a stock fails to undercut the previous low, a risk lingers. The weak holders are likely still in the stock, waiting for a better exit. That better exit — in the weak holder's mind — could be the breakout.A proper shakeout is ultimately good for a stock.Bulls are always happy to say good riddance to weak holders.Alibaba's base shows three down weeks in above-average volume, though one of the weeks is just barely above average. Three weeks show gains in above-average volume.The relative strength line (the blue line on an IBD chart) is near a high, which is bullish. The RS line measures a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500. A rising line points to outperformance.The base is third stage, which lowers the odds for a successful breakout and run-up.RELATED:These 5 Top Stocks Get A Handle On Buy PointsSurprise!

87,ADS,"The stock market uptrend might be under pressure, but you wouldn't know it by looking at several top growth stocks in Tuesday's Stock Spotlight screen.Names like HealthEquity (HQY), Oasis Petroleum (OAS), Inogen (INGN) and China-based ZTO Express (ZTO) are testing support successfully after recent base breakouts.On a weekly chart, heavy-volume support at the 10-week moving average is always good to see after a breakout. It's often a sign that institutional investors are adding to a current successful position, or buying the stock for the first time.After a breakout from a base in early May, health savings account provider HealthEquity paid a visit to its 10-week line last week. It wasn't a convincing case of support, though, as shares fell nearly 7% for the week. Still, the stock closed in the top half of its weekly range, ending just above the 10-week line. Shares are up 2.5% so far this week.Houston-based oil and gas producer Oasis Petroleum is also showing decent action around its 10-week line. A bounce off the support level during the week ended June 22 was compelling, but volume was light. Shares slumped nearly 6% last week but held above the support level. As of Tuesday's close, Oasis was still holding above the 10-week line, but interested buyers should wait for a bounce off the line with conviction before pulling the trigger.Inogen, a maker of portable oxygen concentrators for patients with chronic respiratory conditions, is also holding support at the 10-week line after a breakout from a base in April. But an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of D- gives pause. The rating is hurt, in part, by a heavy-volume drop for Inogen during the week ended May 26. Inogen has recovered nicely, albeit in light trade, as it trades tightly near the 10-week line.China-based package delivery firm ZTO Express is getting support after a base breakout during the week ended May 25.

93,ADS,"Chinese video streaming firm iQiyi (IQ) has rallied in four of the past five sessions, rose as much as 14% intraday Monday, and made a new high of 32.40.So, is the recent price action a climax run, and thus a sell signal?No. The quick reason: iQiyi simply hasn't shown the necessary size of gains that typically precede this offense-type sell signal.In a climax run, a stock goes up in a nearly vertical manner after rising steadily for months or years. Statistically, the stock will also rise 25% to 50% within the span of just a couple of weeks. It may also rise in seven of the past eight trading sessions, or in eight of 10 days.IQiyi has vaulted 42% in just five sessions. But in a typical climax run, most market leaders will have broken out of a base and rallied for a minimum 18 weeks. They usually will have already doubled, even tripled, in price, before staging the climax run. IQiyi fails to meet these criteria. The company debuted less than three months ago on March 29, pricing its IPO at 18 a share.At Monday's peak, the total gain was 80%.Still, the big swing seen in Monday trading is enough justification for holders to take at least some profits off the table. Why? IQiyi broke out of a three-week IPO base on May 10, bolting past a 20.60 buy point. The gain from that proper entry has now exceeded 50%.One of IBD's top offense-type sell rules is this: Take gains in most of your stocks when the breakout achieves a 20% to 25% advance from the proper buy point. If you have huge conviction in the company, then aiming for a 30% to 50% gain is fine. But at some point, you'll want to lock in gains before the winner goes into a natural price correction.The Baidu (BIDU) spinoff is seen as the Netflix of China, providing a platform for high-quality videos over the internet. In addition to original content, iQiyi also offers live broadcasts, online games and books and e-commerce services.The company's sales jumped 56% to $2.6 billion in 2017, but the company also lost $3.86 a share.Analysts see iQiyi posting a net loss of $1.37 a share this year and a loss of $1.09 in 2019.Elsewhere, Apple (AAPL) established a new follow-on buy point, a four-weeks-tight pattern as it unveiled new products and upgrades. Shares rose more than 1% and got as high as 193.41, 1.5% above a 190.47 entry. Volume is running below average as of Monday afternoon action.The four-weeks-tight is an extension of the three-weeks-tight pattern. The tight action reflects an unwillingness among institutional holders to sell their shares.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more analysis on charts, buy points, sell signals, and financial markets.)RELATED:When To Sell Stocks: What Is A Climax Run?The Latest Inside Investor's CornerHow Much Are These Companies Crushing The S&P 500 This Year?

96,ADS,"A migraine prevention treatment from Eli Lilly (LLY) faces an uphill battle against Amgen (AMGN) which, late Thursday, had strong results from long-term studies of its approved medicine.Both Amgen and Lilly have migraine prevention drugs called anti-CGRPs. These drugs work by blocking a specific peptide associated with migraines. Amgen's drug, Aimovig, grabbed approval in May, but Lilly's is fast approaching approval, likely in September.Although Allergan's (AGN) Botox is well known as a treatment for wrinkles and facial lines, it has other uses in excessive sweating, urinary incontinence and to prevent migraines. On Wednesday, Lilly showed that its drug, called Emgality, can benefit patients for whom Botox didn't prevent migraines.But RBC Capital Markets analyst Kennen MacKay doesn't expect the study to ""substantially impact positioning in the marketplace.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""We do find the post-Botox analysis to provide a unique perspective and marketing point for Emgality with the physicians who have established familiarity with Botox and the estimated 50% of patients that may step through Botox to CGRP therapy,"" he said in a report.On the stock market today, Lilly advanced 1% at the closing bell, to 85.49. Amgen sank 0.1%, to 183.34. Shares of pharmaceutical and biotech companies each rose a fraction.Late Wednesday, Lilly said Emgality benefited some patients for whom Botox didn't work to prevent migraines.Lilly tested its anti-CGRP at 120-milligram and 240-milligram doses in patients who failed on Botox as a migraine prevention treatment. On average, 41.3% and 47.5%, respectively, saw their migraine days per month cut in half.""These data are compelling given that Botox is a commonly used agent in the prophylactic treatment paradigm for migraine, and could potentially be required as a step-through therapy prior to treatment with the CGRP class,"" RBC's MacKay said.But Lilly will continue to face an uphill battle against Amgen, MacKay said. U.S. officials approved Aimovig in May. The drug already has an established safety and effectiveness profile. It also beat rivals Lilly, Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) to market.""We expect that Aimovig will continue to benefit from their first-to-market status,"" he said.But MacKay doesn't expect Aimovig to completely fill the revenue hole Amgen faces amid a growing list of challenges for its legacy products. Notably, three of Amgen's drugs are facing potential competition from biosimilars, nearly identical drugs.Further, Amgen partners with Novartis (NVS) on Aimovig, meaning it will have to share sales.Amgen is more bullish, though. The biotech released results on Wednesday of a survey of 11,000 patients who experience at least four migraines per month. Six in 10 respondents said they missed at least a week of work each month due to migraines.Effective migraine prevention could help ease an estimated $22 billion annually in economic cost, Amgen said. About half of that is due to lost productivity. Additional data show patients are often reluctant to admit suffering from a migraine.This suggests the ""already extremely large market could see potential upside beyond the incident and prevalent populations estimated in medical literature, as well as the numbers underpinning assumptions in our model,"" MacKay said.MacKay estimates that there are 2.4 million chronic and 4.3 million episodic migraine patients in the U.S.""However, despite potential for the migraine market to be significantly larger vs. established literature, we see (Amgen's) base business erosion creating a significant/challenging revenue hole to fill, especially given Aimovig revenues are shared with partner Novartis,"" he said.Late Thursday, Amgen said Aimovig was tested for a year in chronic migraine patients. The biotech also took an interim look at data three years into an ongoing five-year study in episodic migraine patients. Researchers tested patients at doses of 140 milligrams and 70 milligrams.On average, patients saw their migraine day per month decline by a respective 10.5 days and 8.5 days. Monthly migraine days declined by half for 67% and 53% of patients, respectively. Those days also dropped by three-quarters in 42% and 27% of patients, respectively.Just 13% of patients on the 14-milligram dose and 6% of patients on the 70-milligram dose had no migraine days.""These data showing sustained (effectiveness) and consistent safety and tolerability of Aimovig over an extended period of time are important for migraine patients and their clinicians to know,"" Stewart Tepper, professor of neurology at Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth Medical School, said in a prepared statement.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Trade Stocks: Why Most Penny Stocks Fail To Make Investors RichSell And Take Profits Or Hold?

That left the financial software provider more than 150% above its May 24 IPO price.The list's only other gains for the week came from stocks outside China: Mellanox (MLNX) and Orion Engineered Carbons (OEC). Both are extended from buy points.Among the week's more interesting chart action, software developer Atlassian — headquartered in the U.K. with its operations in Australia — added a tenth week to an unusual base pattern.Atlassian's cloud-based products help direct project-management and team collaboration within large companies and government agencies. IBD Sector Leader ServiceNow (NOW) is a key competitor, as are Box (BOX) and the start up Slack. In addition, Microsoft (MSFT) entered the market in early 2017 with its own products. It moved more seriously into the space early this month with its $7.5 billion acquisition of GitHub.Atlassian has also been an acquirer, paying $425 million for Trello in January last year. Analysts expect to see more deals.Despite the competition, consensus views see Atlassian earnings rising 33% this year and 40% in 2019. Revenue growth is projected at 34% and 30%, respectively, over the same two years.Atlassian shares are up about 42% so far this year. The advance has been saw-toothed, with many highs and lows, including a breakout attempt that failed in February. At the same time, the gains have been loosely cradled by the stock's 10-week moving average.The result sets up the perfect circumstances for an ascending base, considered to be a rare but bullish chart pattern. An ascending base forms when buying pressure forces a stock higher, while general weakness in the market triggers periodic flight among investors.The result is a three-lobe base that forms over a nine-to-16 week period. Each grotto within the base forms higher highs and higher lows. The final high provides the position of the buy point.In Atlassian's case, the base began during the week ended April 20. The buy point is at 68.85. The stock has been trying to clear that entry but fell almost 5% early Friday, testing support at its 10-week moving average before paring losses to around 2%. That left shares down a bit more than 2% for the week.While the base is considered rare, IBD Leaderboard and Global Leaders stock Autohome (ATHM) broke out from an ascending base May 30 with a 107.64 buy point.And while the bases tend to be bullish, some do fail. Alibaba Group broke out from an ascending base in September. The stock rose 8% before pulling back far enough to trigger the automatic sell rule in February.By Thursday, Atlassian's relative strength line had leveled out at new highs.

109,ADS,"Several years ago China e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) set out on a path to change the face of retailing. Billions of dollars and several acquisitions later, you could say it's well on its way to accomplishing its mission.XIt started in 2014, when the Amazon (AMZN) of China paid $692 million for a stake in department store chain and mall operator Intime Retail Group, in a move to digitize brick-and-mortar department stores. A year later Alibaba paid $4.6 billion for a 20% stake in Sunning, an electronics retailer with 1,600 outlets. The company then forked over $2.9 billion for a 36% stake in Hong Kong-based Sun Art Retail. It's the largest operator of supermarkets in China, with about 446 stores in 224 cities.The company didn't stop there. Early last year it shelled out $2.6 billion to acquire the rest of Intime it didn't already own. During this same period Alibaba was building its own chain of brick-and-mortar supermarkets, called Hema. There, consumers have a variety of options on how they shop.Its ""New Retail"" strategy integrates e-commerce and conventional retailing in an effort to boost sales and convenience. Similar to Amazon's $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods Market last year, Alibaba believes a foothold in traditional retail is the path to future growth.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Our New Retail initiatives are substantially growing Alibaba's total addressable market in commerce,"" said Joseph Tsai, Alibaba executive vice chairman, during the company's quarterly earnings conference call May 4. ""In retail, we are anticipating changing consumer behavior and increasing expectations of quality and convenience, whether these consumers shop online or in offline stores.""The New Retail phrase was coined by company founder Jack Ma more than two years ago.""The big prize for Alibaba in New Retail is modernizing the 'other 80%' of retail sales not yet online,"" Raymond James analyst Aaron Kessler said in a recent report to clients. ""This means redefining the entire process of conventional retail workflow.""That includes new marketing methods, pricing models, inventory management, and sourcing and supply-chain management.""We think this business will ultimately be as high a margin, or better than the existing marketplace model,"" Kessler said. Kessler has raised his price target on Alibaba stock to 300 from 250. That is more than 50% from where the stock currently trades.As an example, users with a Hema supermarket app hook up to Alibaba's e-commerce platform and payment system. They then can shop for groceries online and have them delivered or pick them up.Or they can order fresh food and have it prepared by Hema chefs. And they can pay for any of it using the Alibaba online payment platform Alipay.The idea is to draw customers deeper into Alibaba's consumer-facing ecosystem. Alibaba is already the largest e-commerce services provider in China and looks to leverage that to grow its brick-and-mortar business.""With this transformation, China's $5 trillion in retail sales will be available to Alibaba as our total addressable market,"" Tsai said.There are 47 Hema stores in 13 cities across China, with 14 added in the first quarter. While that's not quite the 400-plus Whole Foods outlets that Amazon gained in one fell swoop with its $13.7 billion deal, Alibaba says its pace will accelerate.Part of the overall strategy involves attracting customers online, then directing them to physical stores and service centers. The partnerships also involve companies working together on integrating e-commerce platforms and logistics, in part to provide speedier delivery or in-store pickup. And they often include exclusive partnerships with retailers and brands.Alibaba is also developing algorithms to analyze customer data. It looks at brand affiliation, purchasing history and even tracks store visit time. The idea is to better understand shopper preferences and predict changes in habits. The results can then be used to adjust product offerings.

The company expects revenue growth for fiscal year 2019 to exceed 60%, or more than 50% excluding acquired companies.KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Hans Chung expects the company's new retail initiatives to be the key driver of revenue growth in fiscal 2019.

111,ADS,"A rumored buyout of drugmaker Tesaro (TSRO) by Swiss drugmaker Roche (RHHBY) — which sent shares of Tesaro soaring Wednesday — makes little sense from a strategic standpoint, one analyst says.RBC analyst Kennen MacKay sees the combination as unlikely ""given what we see as a lack of a compelling strategic rationale."" Tesaro makes an ovarian cancer drug called Zejula, which competes against rival drugs from AstraZeneca (AZN) and Clovis Oncology (CLVS).MacKay notes Tesaro's 2018 guidance for Zejula sales is in trouble as rivalries grow in ovarian cancer drug sales. He expects Tesaro to lower its full-year outlook. That would make a potential acquirer hesitant, he said in a report to clients.Spanish website Intereconomia.com said late Tuesday that Roche is interested in acquiring Tesaro after it announced its plan to buy Foundation Medicine (FMI). The site reports Roche could announce the acquisition of Tesaro in the next few days.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAt the closing bell on the stock market today, Tesaro stock rocketed 16.3%, to 46.49. The stock popped as much as 19.6% in earlier trading. Roche lifted 2.1%, to 27.09. At the same time, biotech stocks rose less than 1.5%.Further, Tesaro already has ongoing collaborations with Dow Jones component Merck (MRK) in treating forms of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. It's also partnered with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in developing Zejula to treat prostate cancer.Roche, on the other hand, is collaborating with Roche's rival Clovis in treating gynecological tumors. Clovis makes an ovarian cancer drug called Rubraca. The duo is testing Rubraca with Roche's immuno-oncology drug called Tecentriq.""With Roche's focus on developing/acquiring best-in-class molecules, we see Rubraca (with its in-line effectiveness and superior safety vs. Zejula) as a potentially better fit within the context of this strategy than Zejula,"" MacKay said.Tesaro, too, already has partnerships with Zejula in markets outside the U.S. This may detract from the value of acquiring it for a global pharmaceutical company like Roche.On the flip side, Roche and Tesaro do have an ongoing clinical collaboration to look at Roche's Tecentriq with Zejula in bladder cancer. Researchers are also combining Zejula and Roche's drug Avastin in a form of ovarian cancer.RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

During the quarter, Crestor brought in $389 million in sales, declining 38% year over year.In China, sales of Crestor grew 39% to $145 million. But in the U.S., revenue from Crestor toppled 59% to $46 million. European and Japanese sales fell 67% and 76%, respectively.

119,ADS,"Seven of IBD's current 10-stock list of Global Leaders are companies based in China. Three of those seven are still in bases or buy ranges.The three are Daqo New Energy (DQ), Alibaba Group (BABA) and ZTO Express (ZTO). Overall, the bases are messy. But all three are IBD 50 names. In addition, Alibaba is on IBD's Sector Leaders screen. So all three stocks are worthy of a closer look.The choppiness in the bases has less to do with the stocks themselves and owes more to the back-and-forth uncertainties as the U.S. and China wrestle to restructure their trade relationship. The tumult is affecting nearly all China stocks.Still, Daqo's base is sloppy because of the way the stock has spiked and tumbled during its consolidation. Still, it managed to build a valid double bottom with a 65.10 buy point. The base is also odd because the stock seemed to form a five-week handle beginning April 10.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut the would-be handle is too low, with its midpoint below the midpoint in the overall pattern. What's more, the handle is 19% deep — beyond the 12% maximum for normal handles. (The 19% depth also squelches the interpretation that the five-week handle is a flat base.)Daqo broke out in a big 14% spike on May 16. On May 8, the producer of polysilicon used in photovoltaic cells had reported a solid first-quarter beat. After the breakout, shares rose almost 10% above the buy point. The stock is still near the entry.Investors are likely to be wary of Daqo's earnings outlook. The consensus view sees EPS down 24% this year, although growth for the June quarter is forecast at 93%.Alibaba's base is a neater double bottom, a third-stage pattern with its buy point at 201.60. But while Daqo's base held comfortably above support at its 40-week moving average, Alibaba's fell below support at its 40-week line for four weeks, then recovered.The stock has been testing resistance around 200. Shares failed to climb much even after Raymond James on Thursday raised its price-target hike to 300 from 250.ZTO Express, a delivery and logistics services provider, broke out past an 18.18 cup-base buy point in heavy trade during Thursday's stock market action. The October 2016 IPO remained well within buy range, but it is below its initial offering price of 19.50 a share.ZTO's cup was also rangy and turbulent.

121,ADS,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) is getting some breathing room, an analyst said Thursday, as rival Proteostasis (PTI) tumbled on disappointing results from a study testing cystic fibrosis drugs.Proteostasis tested its drug, PTI-801, in patients also taking Vertex's drug Orkambi. The regimen showed improvements in blood glucose, sweat chloride — an indicator of cystic fibrosis — and weight gain. But patients didn't experience a major improvement in their breathing.It's ""not as easy as it looks,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note. Vertex shares have dipped 10% quarter to date on competitive worries. But the ""sell-off can reverse after competitive threats fade,"" he said.Vertex rose as much as 2.5% intraday, but ended the regular session down a fraction to 145.75. Shares of Proteostasis crashed 38% to 3.03 on the stock market today. Galapagos (GLPG), another rival, saw its shares lose 2.5% to 102.67 on Proteostasis' news.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseA number of cystic fibrosis drugs work to correct malfunctioning protein made by the CFTR gene. PTI-801 is what's known as a CFTR corrector. Vertex has a portfolio of correctors that work in different patients based on their own genetic mutations.Vertex, Proteostasis and Galapagos with partner AbbVie (ABBV) are all working on combinations of drugs to treat cystic fibrosis. The study from Proteostasis was looking to determine the best doses of PTI-801 for double- and triple-pill studies, Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz said.The key metric these tests look to improve is forced expiratory volume for one second. In Proteostasis' study, the best result came from a 200-milligram dose of PTI-801 on top of Orkambi. That improved forced expiratory volume for one second by 2.5 percentage points.But that lagged Vertex's newly approved drug Symdeko — a two-medicine regimen — which improves patients' ability to forcefully expel air by 10% to 11%, Leerink's Porges said. Now, Proteostasis' competitive threat ""appears modest,"" he said""While Proteostasis' corrector binds to a different site on the CFTR protein than Vertex's medicines, the failure to match the high (effectiveness) bar established by Vertex is a testament to the difficult development path for competitors with small molecule therapies for cystic fibrosis,"" he said.Galapagos will likely have data later this month for a study of its second-generation corrector on top of Orkambi.The results from Proteostasis ""suggest that the medicinal chemistry at Vertex may indeed be a durable competitive advantage for the company in the cystic fibrosis indication,"" he said. But if Galapagos is successful, Vertex could ""retrace back to the 160-170 range through June and July.""RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Tame A Volatile Swing Trade With A Half PositionLooking For The Next Nvidia?

122,ADS,"President Donald Trump won't be at the June 22 OPEC meeting, but his presence will be felt as the oil group's split over a production increase could result in a rare public stalemate.XAt issue is OPEC's agreement with nonmembers like Russia to cut production by 1.8 million barrels a day. OPEC's de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, and Russia want to boost output, while top OPEC members Iran, Iraq, Venezuela and Kuwait aren't on board.Any official decision to boost production laid out in the post-meeting communique needs to be unanimous. But Saudi Arabia and Russia have already started boosting output and are expected to keep going, despite the opposition.U.S. crude, which fell 2% overnight, rebounded to close 1.2% higher to $65.88 per barrel. Brent crude jumped 2.6% to $75.34 Markets are now pricing in a production hike of 300,000-600,000 barrels per day, closer to the lower end of expectations.Shares of Exxon Mobil (XOM) rose 0.2% to 80.82 on the stock market today, Chevron (CVX) popped 1.6%. BP (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) climbed 0.5%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBob McNally, president of the Rapidan Energy Group consulting firm, believes the upcoming meeting could rival a contentious 2011 meeting, which then-Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi called ""one of the worst meetings we have ever had,"" in terms of discord.The 2011 meeting fell apart after Venezuela and Iran gathered enough support to block Saudi Arabia's effort to boost output, as the Arab Spring created tensions between traditional Persian Gulf allies.Political discord is rising again in the region and Iran and Venezuela might be able to block another official output increase. This time, Trump's recent bashing of OPEC over its effort to curb production and boost oil prices is deepening fissures.Iran's OPEC governor, Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, said he objected to an increase after Trump blamed the cartel for high oil prices. Ardebili said that Iran, Iraq and Venezuela are prepared to veto a production increase from Saudi Arabia and Russia.""Three OPEC founders are going to stop it,"" Ardebili told Bloomberg. ""If the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Russia want to increase production, this requires unanimity. If the two want to act alone, that's a breach of the cooperation agreement.""And Kuwait reportedly believes its traditional close ally Saudi Arabia isn't looking out for OPEC but is instead trying to appease Trump, who has backed the kingdom's hard-line stance against Iran.""Trump has made him a target of the hawks, Iran, Kuwait,"" McNally said. ""It will be harder for hawks to agree to increase if it looks like it was partly caused by President Trump's pressure.""But Russia could have some sway over Iran, said Thomas O'Donnell, a senior energy analyst at the consulting firm Wikistrat. Russian President Vladimir Putin played the intermediary between rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran in 2016, when the deal to curb production was reached.""It will be interesting to see if he (Putin) has good relations with the Iranians,"" O'Donnell said. ""I do expect down the road when the campaign against Iran gets more intense, Putin will essentially sell them out.""But production will likely increase no matter OPEC's official stance.""It is pretty clear that the countries participating in the Vienna group, those that can increase production, will,"" McNally said, referring to OPEC and its nonmember partners.Saudi Arabia already reported an increase in production in the latest OPEC monthly report. And Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said June 14 that an agreement to boost production was ""inevitable.""Meanwhile, even the countries that want to raise production don't agree on how much. Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies want to raise total output by 300,000 barrels per day, but Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said the group should boost production by as much as 1.5 million bpd. Reuters sources said the two sides are looking at raising production by 1 million bpd. McNally expects an increase of 400,000-500,000 bpd.While Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United Arab Emirates might unofficially agree to boost production, the official communique, if there is one, will likely be vague, McNally said.This could create further cracks in OPEC and lessen its effectiveness.Top oil producers and emerging allies Saudi Arabia and Russia are already looking at their own, separate agreement. In a statement released Thursday, the two countries announced they would develop a ""comprehensive bilateral agreement"" on energy cooperation.Congress is also adding pressure to the already contentious OPEC meeting. On June 13, the House Judiciary Committee submitted the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act bill to the floor of the House. The NOPEC bill would allow the Treasury Department to sue OPEC countries under the Sherman Antitrust Act.McNally said the bill has ""overwhelming"" bipartisan support. Presidents Bush and Obama pushed back on similar bills when they came up in the past. But McNally isn't sure Trump would oppose the latest one.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Permian Oil Prices Dive As Gas Prices Rise, Boosting These RefinersWhy The Next Oil Bonanza Could Be Deep Under WaterOil Stocks And Industry News

It rose 5.2%, vs. the internet content group's 4.3% gain and a 4% advance for the enterprise software developers.Netflix (NFLX) is clearly the big dog in the movies group. It posted a 4.9% gain over the five-day period. That pushed it toward new highs and further into its profit-taking zone with expectations high ahead of its Q2 report.The group has ranked No. 1 for most of the past four weeks among the 197 groups tracked by IBD. It is not home to the big, diversified media names such as Walt Disney (DIS) and 21st Century Fox (FOXA). Yet it holds plenty of other recognizable names.Lion's Gate Entertainment (LGFA) has been the breeding ground for everything from ""Rambo"" to ""The Hunger Games."" It climbed 3.1% in the five sessions through Tuesday. Cinemark Holdings (CNK), which operates more than 300 theaters with 4,500 movie screens across 41 states, gained 3.2%.Analyst consensus expects Lion's Gate to post its first quarterly loss in 11 quarters when its reports fiscal first-quarter results on Aug. 9.

In fact, Ning Tang has a new word for it: ""wealthtech.""Tang, founder and CEO of Beijing-based CreditEase Ltd., says the market for investment management services in the No. 2 world economy is ""actually in a quite primitive market stage."" Why?Chinese people ""don't have a good idea on asset allocation or long-term investing,"" Tang told IBD in an interview at the Milken Institute Global Conference held in Beverly Hills, Calif., last month. ""They don't have a top-down approach."" They tend to be ""more speculative investors.""Speculators have certainly gotten bit hard by big swings in mainland China equities. In June 2015, the Shanghai Composite ended a yearlong rally with a swift decline. The index plunged 45%, from 5178 to 2850, in just 11 weeks. The severe drop, sparked in part by government measures to restrict margin loans by stockbrokers, rocked equity markets around the globe.That bear market has made some Chinese investors willing to invest only in fixed income products, says Tang, who attended The University of the South in Sewanee, Tenn. ""The Chinese investing class is several decades behind the U.S., in my view,"" he added.Today, the Shanghai lies more than 40% below that peak. Hong Kong's Hang Seng benchmark, has performed better. At 30,492, the index is just 8% below its all-time peak marked on Jan. 29 this year.Tang envisions a new phase of growth in financial services over the next decade. The internet will play a pivotal role. Online-based financial advisory services will help Chinese investors learn concepts such as dollar-cost averaging, having both short-term and long-term investments, holding cash in the portfolio, and using insurance products for long-term goals.Such financial services just may be the opportunity for further growth by companies including online consumer finance marketplace Yirendai (YRD), the first pure-play ""fintech"" company from China to debut on the U.S. stock exchanges. Tang's CreditEase owns an 82% stake in Yirendai, which debuted on the NYSE at 10 a share in December 2015.After a severe slide in the early 2016, Yirendai muscled its way back to break out at 10.49 in the week ended April 1, 2016. Shares went on a rocky yet impressive climb over the next 18 months, rising 410%. It peaked at 53.50 in October last year. Yirendai shares are now back in deep correction mode. The stock has fallen in five of the past six weeks. At 24.89, it's slumped 53% below the all-time peak.One reason for the decline? Yirendai's growth engine is in need of a big spark.The company lost money in 2013 and 2014, then turned a profit of 74 cents a share in 2015. Over the next two years, Yirendai's earnings jumped 354% to $3.36 a share in 2017. But in three of the past four quarters, earnings fell vs. year-ago levels even as revenue continued to rise at a rapid clip (up 58%, 73%, 82% and 71% in the past four quarters). In Q1 this year, Yirendai said it facilitated $1.91 billion in loans to 174,128 qualified individual borrowers via its online marketplace. The delinquency rate for loans due 60-89 days was 1.3%.Wall Street sees profits rising 14% this year to $3.84 a share this year, then ramping up 41% to $5.42 in 2019.Lending site LexinFintech (LX) and Noah Holdings (NOAH) also look poised to benefit from future growth in demand for online and offline wealth management and related services.LexinFintech, a Dec. 21, 2017, new IPO at 9 a share, is working on a new base since topping at 20 on March 12.

129,ADS,"Oil prices and stocks, led by Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA), Marathon Oil (MRO) and California Resources (CRC), surged after OPEC agreed to increase production next month, though the vagueness of the deal underscored the fissures in the oil group.XOPEC producers and allies like Russia will aim to increase output by about 1 million barrels per day, Saudi Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih told reporters, though the actual increase is likely to be smaller as countries like Venezuela struggle to ramp up. S&P Global Platts expects a net output increase of around 700,000 bpd, largely met by Saudi Arabia.But OPEC's official statement on the decision didn't provide a specific number for the production increase. Instead, the statement said producers will more closely adhere to an earlier deal to reduce production by 1.8 million barrels per day. Since that deal was struck in 2016, participants have substantially overshot that target, with the reduction estimated at 2.8 million bpd.Despite the mixed signals coming from OPEC, the highly awaited policy decision Friday is bullish for oil prices as the planned output boost will bring markets closer to balance, said Edward Jones analyst Brian Youngberg.But he also found the contentious run-up to Friday's decision telling, as Iran had threatened to veto proposals to boost output.""OPEC is not the unified group it once was, they are all different interests and different capabilities,"" said Youngberg, who sees the introduction of electric vehicles and rise in U.S. shale production further crimping OPEC's leadership in the years ahead.He added that politics are more of an issue within OPEC now, with Russia playing both sides of the Iran-Saudi Arabia geopolitical rivalry.Last week, Saudi Arabia and Russia, which isn't an OPEC member, notably began looking at forging their own, separate agreement on energy cooperation.U.S. crude oil prices jumped 4.6% to settle at $68.58 a barrel, and Brent crude rallied 3.4% to $75.55 a barrel. Royal Dutch Shell spiked 4.4% on the stock market today. Marathon Oil leapt 8%, and shale producer California Resources soared 10%.

""They don't have to renegotiate quotas,"" bypassing a thorny issue and avoiding antagonizing OPEC members who can't produce, he added.What OPEC achieved, he added, ""is trying to keep (Brent crude) prices in a narrow range and not to cross $80+.""Ahead of OPEC's policy meeting in Vienna on Friday, divisions within the oil cartel threw the outcome into uncertainty up to the last minute.OPEC's de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, and Russia sought to boost output again. But Iran was stubbornly opposed to a boost, as renewed U.S. sanctions would prevent it from selling more oil anyway. Other OPEC members like Venezuela and Iraq also signaled they weren't on board with an increase.OPEC was able to overcome objections by Iran and others to production increases by framing their decision as a return to the originally agreed 1.8 million bpd cuts, S&P Global Platts noted.""The fact that we dealt with overcompliance (on cutback commitments) that was worrying the industry … this is what made the deliberations meaningful,"" OPEC President Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei of the United Arab Emirates said in a press conference Friday.On Saturday, OPEC and its non-member partners will hold another meeting to ratify today's agreement.Meanwhile, the OPEC decision is unlikely to drive any strategic shift from American shale companies in the near term, Youngberg said.In the past year, many companies have promised to prioritize spending discipline over production expansion after previously rushing to pump more oil when prices recovered.""Shale plays are focused really on living within their cash flow and returning excess cash to shareholders,"" reflected in their debt reduction, dividends and buybacks, he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, CoalIBD Stock Of The DayBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

130,ADS,"Sellers still held the upper hand in stocks today as the Nasdaq composite and the Dow Jones industrial average fell between 0.6% and 0.7%. At 3 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 dropped 0.5% and is poised to make its first weekly loss after rising four weeks in a row. But New York Times defied the sell-off with a new breakout.Hot new China IPO iQiyi (IQ), meanwhile, sold off sharply. The video streaming firm fell more than 10% to 39.51, showing its biggest single-session point loss since breaking out of a narrow IPO base at 20.60.When stocks have made many months of gains and are in a climax run, that would be a sell signal. IQiyi's advance doesn't quite fit that profile, but its slide today is reason to take at least some profits in an offense-minded way.IQiyi also gave short-term traders a potential sell signal after the stock dipped below its 10-day moving average near 38.78 for the first time since its breakout. At one point, iQiyi fell as much as 14.5% to a session low of 37.80. You can see the 10-day moving average as a thin green line on a Leaderboard chart.Among fast-rising growth stocks, the 10-day line often acts as a better indicator of when a leader is ready to take a pause. When a stock has risen more than 10% from a proper buy point, then sharply undercuts the 10-day moving average, it can act as a timely sell signal for short-term traders.The small-cap S&P 600 did slightly worse than the major averages, falling roughly 0.8%. But at 1044, the S&P 600 continues to outmatch the S&P 500 in year-to-date gains, up 11.5% vs. a 3% advance since Jan. 1 for the large-cap benchmark.With less than hour to go in stocks today, volume is running a touch lower on the Nasdaq vs. the same time on Wednesday and roughly 5% lower on the NYSE.One small cap in the media space broke out. New York Times (NYT) rallied nearly 5% to hit a high of 26.50. Shares cleared a four-month flat base, a key chart pattern for growth stock investors, at 25.80 in average trade. The permissible buy zone goes up to 27.09.Buying too far extended in price puts an investor at higher risk of being shaken out during a normal pullback by the stock after it breaks out.According to IBD Stock Checkup, NYT's Composite Rating has improved to a respectable 86 on a scale of 1 to 99. Plus, that score is tops within the Media-Newspapers industry group. The next best company is New Media Investment Group (NEWM), owning a mediocre 71 Composite score.NYT logged an 8% increase in the top line to $1.68 billion in 2017. That marked only the second time in at least nine years that the company's sales increased on a year-over-year basis. More recently, NYT has shown a big turnaround in earnings.Profits grew 64%, 117%, 30% and 70% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. Easy comparisons helped the cause. Revenue grew 9%, 6%, 10% and 4% over the same time frame. That falls well short of the C factor in IBD's CAN SLIM seven-point investment paradigm. The best stocks tend to show earnings and sales increases of 25% or higher in recent quarters.New Media Investment recently broke out of a 10-week flat base with an 18.05 buy point. At 18.82, the small cap is 4% past that correct entry, or still within the proper buy zone.New Media has grown revenue by 18% and 11% in the prior two quarters, the biggest gains since the first quarter of 2016.Retail internet companies got thumped after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states have broad authority to enforce the collection of sales taxes by online retail companies doing business in their jurisdiction. Stamps.com (STMP) slid more than 11% in quadruple normal share turnover and briefly undercut its 50-day moving average.Leaderboard name Etsy (ETSY), the global online marketplace for arts and crafts entrepreneurs, hit a new high of 45.88 but reversed to a 1.6% decline. Volume is running twice its 50-day average.Big declines in heavier than normal volume are a telltale sign of pronounced institutional selling.Etsy, which holds a top-notch 99 Composite Rating, has already rallied more than 45% since vaulting off its 50-day moving average near 29.18 in late May.Shares are also up more than 108% since clearing a cup without handle at 21.96 on Feb. 21, one week after the market staged a Day 4 follow-through and signaled a new market uptrend was possibly in play.The automaker group fared among the 10 worst performers in IBD's daily ranking of 197 industry groups.Ferrari (RACE) gapped lower at the open and skidded 2%. At 140.32, the maker of luxury sports cars is now slightly below a 141.66 buy point in a five-week flat base.Tesla (TSLA) fell nearly 3% but is still finding a floor of potential support at the 350 level. Shares of the electric-vehicle pioneer continue to sail well past its rising 50-day moving average, which has recently risen back above 300.The stock continues to work on a large first-stage base.While the Street sees the company losing $6.82 a share this year, it also expects Tesla to turn a profit of $2.52 a share in 2019.In other financial markets, investors bought back long-dated U.S. Treasuries. The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond fell 3 basis points to 2.90%.Ahead of the OPEC meeting on Friday in Vienna, Austria, WTI crude oil futures edged 0.1% lower to $65.62 a barrel.

For the week ended June 8, Aimovig prescriptions grew 103% week over week to 1,565, RBC analyst Kennan MacKay said in a note.Alder is testing its drug, eptinezumab, as a preventive treatment for episodic and chronic migraines. It also has a migraine prevention drug in preclinical studies. Lilly's galcanezumab is under review in migraine prevention and is also being studied in cluster headaches.Meanwhile, Biohaven Pharmaceutical (BHVN) has an anti-CGRP drug in development as an acute treatment for migraines. It's also testing another anti-CGRP drug to treat and prevent migraines. Allergan (AGN), too, has an anti-CGRP in development as an acute treatment for migraines.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow Much Volume Should You Look For In A Stock?Investing Basics: How To Sell A Stock

OPEC reported in its monthly oil market report Tuesday, that Saudi Arabia has already increased production.But the U.S. request and a Trump tweet in April that blamed OPEC for high oil prices has caused a split within the oil group, with some members accusing Saudi Arabia of being too eager to do Trump's bidding.Meanwhile, IEA sees non-OPEC supply rising by 2 million bpd this year, lead by growth from the U.S. But infrastructure and logistics could constrain growth and the IEA only sees supply growth of 1.7 million bpd in 2019.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Why The Next Oil Bonanza Could Be Deep Under WaterOil Stocks And Industry News

148,ADS,"President Donald Trump rejects the narrative that Russia wanted him to win. USA Today examined each of the 3,517 Facebook ads bought by the Russian-based Internet Research Agency, the company that employed 12 of the 13 Russians indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller for interfering with the 2016 election. It turns out only about 100 of its ads explicitly endorsed Trump or opposed Hillary Clinton.Most of the fake ads focused on racial division, with many of the ads attempting to exploit what Russia perceives, or wants America to perceive, as severe racial tension between blacks and whites.Think of it. Vladimir Putin, president of a formerly communist country with the blood of possibly tens of millions of its own people on its hands, is using the race card in America, the least-racist majority-white country in the world, a country that just a few years ago elected and reelected a black person for president. Putin therefore ""colludes"" with race-card carrying Democrats like Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who once called the ""good"" Bush, George Herbert Walker Bush, a ""racist."" Then there's former Vice President Joe Biden, who recently told the Rev. Al ""no justice, no peace"" Sharpton: ""It's what these guys are all about, man. These Republicans don't want working-class people voting. They don't want black folks voting.""Sharpton, earlier this year, said that Trump ""is someone who's chosen a path that is absolutely racism with steroids."" Sharpton also wrote: ""There were hopes last year that the executive office would temper some of this pettiness, but sadly we now see this is not the case. Rather than attempt to grow and learn, Trump has leaned into his role as divider-in-chief. This is exactly the same racially divisive, unapologetic blowhard I knew in New York.""Sharpton lectures Republicans on political etiquette?Is this the same Sharpton who shot to fame by falsely accusing a white man of raping a black woman? Is this the same Sharpton, who, according to The New York Times in 2014, owes ""more than $4.5 million in current state and federal tax""? Is this the same Sharpton who called the black then-mayor of New York City, David Dinkins, a ""n----- whore""?Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

If you cannot surmise that this President — if he's not racist, he's certainly racist-adjacent. ... We have come to a consensus in our society that facts matter. ... I feel like it's my obligation as a journalist to say it.""Aside from routinely being called ""racist,"" President Trump is denounced on left-wing cable shows and late-night television as a ""liar."" MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell, a former aide to Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., called Trump ""a pathological liar."" CNN's Don Lemon opened a recent show by discussing ""the 3,000 lies that the President has told since inauguration.""Trump's ""lies"" pale in comparison with the Big Lies of the modern left.The left insists, teaches, preaches and indoctrinates that racism remains a major problem in America. So-called ""civil rights"" organizations — like Black Lives Matter, the NAACP or the Southern Poverty Law Center — denounce alleged ""institutional"" or ""systemic"" or ""structural"" racism as a serious problem in America, even as racism continues to recede.The left insists that ""sexism"" remains a major problem in America. Women, President Barack Obama insisted, earn only 77 cents on the dollar compared with men while performing the same work. Even Obama's Department of Labor called it untrue. In 2009, the Labor Department found that, after controlling for obvious education and job differences, the gender ""wage gap"" shrank to only 95%.The Labor Department found that women often make different choices than men: ""A greater percentage of women than men tend to work part-time. Part-time work tends to pay less than full-time work. A greater percentage of women than men tend to leave the labor force for childbirth, child care and elder care. ...""Research also suggests that differences not incorporated into the model due to data limitations may account for part of the remaining gap. ... Much of the literature, including the Bureau of Labor Statistics ... focus on wages rather than total compensation. Research indicates that women may value non-wage benefits more than men do, and as a result prefer to take a greater portion of their compensation in the form of health insurance and other fringe benefits.""The left insists that the rich are getting richer, while the poor are getting poorer. Actually, the percentage of the world living in ""extreme poverty"" — currently less than $1.90 a day — has plummeted in the last three decades. In 1990, the United Nations set a goal to cut the world's poverty rate in half by 2015. That goal was reached five years early: By 2010, over a billion people had escaped extreme poverty in just 20 years.Thanks to a media obsessed with racism, sexism and inequality, and Democrats who play the race card for votes, the Russians have willing accomplices in spreading dissent. After all, President Barack Obama claimed that racism is part of America's ""DNA.""Somewhere, Putin is smiling. Yet none dare call it ""collusion.""Other columns by Larry Elder

161,ADS,"The stock market rarely finds equilibrium — a balance between supply and demand. In fact, CAN SLIM investing is partially based on pinpointing instances on a stock chart that are furthest from equilibrium — where demand is most likely to outstrip supply. So when you want to locate the big market winners, knowing the role of volume is key.This is the S in IBD's CAN SLIM seven-letter acronym for great investing: It stands for supply and demand. And it is the prevailing reason why IBD discusses volume action regarding the overall market, and tracks volume trends and percentage changes in the number of shares trading hands in individual stocks.Supply, in stock trading, is gauged at several different levels. The term outstanding shares refers to all of a company's shares, even restricted shares and those held by company executives or long-term investors and which in most cases aren't likely to see the light of day anytime soon.Another term, the float, subtracts closely held shares from the shares outstanding. This gauge more accurately reflects a stock's liquidity and is more closely related to the action in both price changes and turnover.IBD'S TAKE: Demand from institutional investors — the I in the CAN SLIM methodology — drive winning stock runs. Investors can track that demand using a stock chart's volume characteristics.A couple other key terms are important in a stock's supply/demand relationship: the average daily volume and the average daily dollar volume.  The first averages the number of shares traded over 50 days.  In general, seek a minimum average of 400,000 shares for a leading stock. This level of volume helps make the stock more resistant to manipulation by large-scale investors.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe average daily dollar volume combines a stock's price and daily volume to gauge the amount of capital moving in and out of a stock each day. CAN SLIM rules generally call for potential leaders to trade a minimum dollar volume of $25 million per day.  That is equal to a $63 stock averaging 400,000 shares a day, or a $25 stock averaging a daily turnover of 1 million shares.Used in combination, those measures help investors track the behavior of institutions acting on a single stock.Alibaba Group (BABA) offered a good example. The September 2014 IPO consolidated for 27 months before its breakout in the first quarter of 2017.With a float of more than a billion shares, the stock's supply overwhelmed demand, dragging shares off their high in November 2014 and into a correction more than 50% deep.Throughout the consolidation, large stabs of buying moved upward from 70 million shares per day (1). As more of those shares fell into the hands of investors set to hold, the big-volume buying gradually began to contain the stock's supply.Volume levels started to settle as the stock swung into a five-month cup-with-handle base in September. When the stock began forming a handle in January, volume levels dropped to below average (2) — exactly what you want to see: The sellers have what they want, and the buyers have established their positions.The supply is tight, so that any subsequent demand will drive prices higher. Alibaba found a stasis for almost a month and a half, bumping up against its correct entry price at 104.67. The stock climbed past its buy point in March (3), advancing in 11 of 12 weeks through May 16.Through the end of May in 2018, Alibaba has rallied as much as 102% from the proper buy point.A version of this column was first published on May 19, 2017.RELATED:Top Growth Stocks Today: Inside IBD 50A Stock Breaks Out; How Far Up In Price Can You Buy Shares?Also In Investor's Corner: What Does A ""Base On Base"" Look Like?Global LeadersHave You Mastered This Key Chart Pattern That Many Great Stocks Form Before They Break Out?Sector Leaders

Baozun stock jumped 4.3% to 57.81 Monday while Momo stock pared most of its gains and rose 0.5% to 46.65.Baozun and Momo are top China stocks in the fast-growing internet segment that each earn an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of 99. That means their shares outperform 98% of stocks in the market based on key fundamental and technical factors. Those factors include earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and relative price performance.China internet stocks were some of the top performers in June. But as stock market indexes came under pressure in the latter part of the month, so did China stocks. But pullbacks aren't necessarily bad, as they can lead to buying opportunities.Baozun stock is looking to close at its highest level in eight sessions, and to retaking the 50-day line Monday after hovering around that level for about two weeks of trade.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhen a stock rebounds higher after finding support at the 50-day line, that could be a chance to add shares to a position. With add-on buy points, you want to buy as close to the 50-day line as possible to prevent from buying an extended stock.This represents Baozun's first pullback to the 50-day line, or 10-week line on a weekly chart, since the China stock's earnings fueled a breakout past a 52.43 buy point.The first two pullbacks to the 50-day line after a breakout are seen as good opportunities to add shares to an existing position, as long as the line is above the buy point.But Baozun stock plunged below the 50-day line in above-average turnover on June 27, closing below the buy point. That may have prompted some investors to exit their positions.That's why it's a good idea to take at least partial profits when a stock becomes 20% to 25% extended from a buy point. Baozun reached that level in its third week after the breakout.Meanwhile, Momo is holding above its 50-day line after rebounding from that level Friday. While Momo stock pared all its gains Monday after rising as much as 4.4% early in the session, volume isn't massive. If the stock was falling hard in heavy volume after rising that much, that would be very bearish.The cup-half-full investor would note that Momo battled back to break even after losing as much as 0.9% midway through the session.The chart for Momo stock looks similar to that of Baozun. Shares gapped up, past a buy point, after earnings and then ran up more than 30%. Then it pulled back to the 50-day line. But unlike Baozun, Momo never round-tripped its gains.As this is the first pullback to the 50-day for Momo after a breakout, it could qualify as an add-on opportunity as well.Momo's June-quarter earnings are projected to accelerate from 57% to 77% as revenue growth slows from 64% to 54%. Accelerating earnings growth is bullish. While the top-line growth is seen slowing, a 54% jump still represents strong growth.Meanwhile, Baozun is expected to see earnings growth slow from 29% to 17% on a sequential basis. Revenue growth is estimated to decelerate slightly from 25% to 21%.In addition to looking at stocks with strong technical action, it's important to focus on stocks that have good fundamentals.

163,ADS,"Akorn's (AKRX) top executive complained Tuesday that Fresenius (FMS) officials are unfairly smearing his firm's reputation as Fresenius tries to pull out of $4.3 billion deal to buy the generic-drug maker.Raj Rai, Akorn's chief executive since 2010, told a judge Tuesday that Fresenius' claims that flaws in the company's computer system led to fraudulent test results aren't true. Akorn says that Fresenius is using minor mistakes to create a pretext for backing out of the $34-per-share buyout.Hurting Akorn's reputation with false claims ""is not right,"" Rai told Delaware Chancery Court Judge Travis Laster. ""Customers are sensitive to what is happening to us.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLaster must decide whether Fresenius properly walked away from the Akorn deal in April or whether the German company must finalize the buyout. Some analysts have predicted that the deal could still close at a lower price.Fresenius officials say Akorn's testing miscues, and a history of operational problems that drew warnings from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, justify canceling the deal. They point to what they allege are phony drug-test results. Those were included in FDA submissions to back up their allegations of fraud. The company was forced to withdraw one of the submissions.Under cross-examination, Rai acknowledged that Akorn hasn't lost any customers as a result of Fresenius' fraud claims. The generic drugmaker, once run by billionaire John Kapoor, wouldn't collapse if the deal fell through, Rai contends. Kapoor, now under indictment for racketeering, is Akorn's largest shareholder.Earlier Tuesday, a lawyer for Fresenius said a review of Akorn's computer system found flaws in its security system. Security was so lax, they said, any employee or vendor could review or change the firm's drug-testing data.John Avellanet, a consultant that Akorn hired in 2016 after regulators questioned its operational procedures, made the discovery. He found executives had little security control over the pharma company's computer system. That raised doubts about the integrity of its record-keeping, Lewis Clayton, one of Fresenius' lawyers, said Monday.Akorn fell as much as 4.6%, the most intraday since May 3. Shares had climbed 2.8% Monday. Fresenius fell 0.4%. On the stock market today, Akorn lost 3.3%, to 17.97, at the closing bell.

165,ADS,"With artificial intelligence now firmly entrenched in many hospital operating rooms, the field of robotic surgery is starting to get competitive.Giant companies like Alphabet (GOOGL), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Medtronic (MDT) are training their sights on Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), the king of robotic surgery companies. But analysts say the booming medical technology segment has lots of room to run.Robotic surgery is an area that could grow by billions of dollars as more machines are used to treat patients. Intuitive commands the space with $3.3 billion in annual sales. Its signature da Vinci robotic surgeons, however, are limited in the types of procedures they handle. The multi-limbed da Vinci can be used in a variety of procedures — including cardiac, colorectal, gynecological, head and neck, thoracic and urologic surgeries — but only as long as they're minimally invasive.How big the market could be is still unclear, yet analysts agree the potential has yet to be tapped. So more players are moving in, and quickly.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""I think investors need to understand that the robotics and AI (artificial intelligence) revolution is happening, and it's touching every sector of the economy,"" said Jeremie Capron, the director of research and managing partner for Robo Global, an index and advisory firm specializing in robotic industry investments. ""This is a technological revolution that investors can't afford to miss.""Analysts say that in March, Auris Health became the first company to pose a formidable threat to Intuitive when its catheter-based Monarch Platform gained U.S. approval. Intuitive will counterpunch by seeking approval for a flexible catheter similar to the Auris device, likely this year, RBC analyst Brandon Henry said in a recent report.Meanwhile, others are working in areas where Intuitive Surgical doesn't have a foothold. Smith & Nephew (SNN) has a robotic assistant for knee replacements. Stryker (SYK) has a robotic joint replacement system. Mazor Robotics (MZOR) and Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) have robotic offerings in brain and spinal surgery. Mazor alone could see around $3 billion in sales just from its systems.But these players have a long way to go to take Intuitive Surgical's throne.In 2005, Intuitive had a market cap of $1.3 billion. Today, it's worth nearly $52 billion. Capron calls Intuitive ""an amazing stock.""""I think the investment community has been scratching their heads trying to figure out the impact of those new entrants for Intuitive Surgical,"" he told Investor's Business Daily. ""We feel pretty relaxed about it. The size is big enough for small players to come in.""Shares of medical tech companies have been relatively insulated from the woes frustrating biotech and pharmaceutical stocks of late. The stocks of medical equipment makers such as Intuitive and Mazor have collectively spiked 15% year to date.Intuitive's ""blowout quarter"" in April helped to spur excitement, Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar said in a recent note to clients. Recent investor days from J&J and Medtronic are helping to drive that frenzy.""Robotic surgery is the topic currently in medtech with a blowout quarter from Intuitive Surgical hinting that the pace of manual-to-robotic transition might be picking up,"" Kumar said. ""The topic of competition elicits various responses from investors.""Intuitive Surgical stock is up 33% this year, after climbing 78% in 2017. Kumar expects Intuitive Surgical's competition to become more apparent over the next 12 to 18 months. Intuitive's da Vinci Surgical System now boasts ""five million patients and counting.""The da Vinci systems are also moving deeper into hernias and are seeing early-stage adoption in bariatrics surgery performed to induce weight loss.Myriam Curet, executive vice president and chief medical officer for Intuitive, noted in an email to IBD that an estimated 82% of prostatectomies in the U.S. are performed via robotic-assisted surgery. The same is true for about 80% of malignant hysterectomies.""General surgery is our fastest-growing specialty, and one where we are still in early stages of adoption for procedures such as ventral and inguinal hernia repair, colorectal and bariatric surgery,"" she said. ""We believe there is substantial opportunity to expand robotic usage in these categories, and we are developing additional tools and technologies to do so.""For the year, Intuitive guided on its first-quarter earnings conference call to 12%-15% growth in the number of procedures performed with its systems this year. That followed what many considered a strong fourth quarter in which recurring revenue — including instruments and accessories for its da Vinci systems — grew 11%. Recurring revenue represents 73% of the sales pie.Still, even Intuitive Surgical sees itself in the early innings and expects robotic surgery to present a huge total addressable market. The number of da Vinci procedures performed each year grew nearly 68% from 2013 to 2017.Among other robotic surgery companies, Intuitive's closest competitor, Auris, doesn't trade publicly. Until recently it was in ""stealth mode,"" Kumar said. But in May the medical technology company signed a commercialization agreement with a division of J&J. The agreement came two months after Auris' Monarch system grabbed approval in the U.S.Monarch is a flexible catheter. Surgeons thread it through a patient's mouth and into the lungs by remote control. Before its approval, investors believed ""credible competitors"" to Intuitive would be years away, Kumar says. But Monarch got approval months ahead of views. Intuitive Surgical plans to seek approval of its own flexible catheter later this year.On its website, Auris says Monarch's first target is lung cancer. Some experts estimate half a million lung biopsies are performed in the U.S. each year. Surgeons could also use flexible catheters in urinary tract procedures, which number roughly 400,000 procedures a year.Intuitive isn't sweating the competition. Auris' chief executive, interestingly, is Frederic Moll, who founded Intuitive Surgical in 1995. Intuitive's current CEO, Gary Guthart, joined the medical technology firm in 1996 and took over as CEO in 2010.""We have built technologies and made decisions about our architecture based on first principles, not by looking over our shoulder at what other people are doing, but by really engaging customers deeply and understanding their clinical needs,"" Guthart said on a recent earnings call.RBC's Henry notes Auris' Monarch has a 25% larger catheter than Intuitive's to allow for its camera. Intuitive sees a benefit in a smaller catheter that can move deeper into the lungs, Henry wrote in a recent report. That would allow surgeons to potentially use it to remove diseased tissue.Meanwhile, J&J has teamed up with Google on a company called Verb Surgical. Analysts are unsure what system the team is creating. They do expect it to enter the robotic surgery market in 2020, though.At the same time, Medtronic is partnered with Mazor. Medtronic also expects its own robotic surgery system to launch in 2020.It's not unreasonable to suggest Intuitive could keep 80% of the market, Evercore's Kumar told IBD. New robotic surgery companies will have to differentiate themselves.""They can't have a straightforward, 'me too' product,"" he said. ""Investors have put a pretty punchy marketable valuation on Intuitive Surgical because we're still in the early stages of this robotic conversation.""But, he added, ""This market is big enough to sustain multiple players.""That's where companies like Mazor and Zimmer Biomet, which makes systems called ROSA, come in. Both have systems that surgeons use in brain and spinal procedures.Like others, Mazor CEO Ori Hadomi says sizing the opportunity for robotic surgery companies is difficult. Surgeons use the $1.1 million Mazor X system in spinal surgeries. The company's Renaissance system can perform spinal and brain surgeries and costs $500,000.Disposable instruments and materials comprised 40% to 60% of Mazor's revenue, Hadomi told IBD. For each surgery performed with the Mazor X, the list price is $1,500 in terms of disposable items. An estimated half a million procedures would generate $750 million.Stakeholders expect spine procedures to grow rapidly.""People are being more and more active,"" he said, meaning they will suffer more injuries and require surgery more often. ""The procedures will become less invasive. The safer the procedures will become, the more patients will be willing and interested to be treated, to be operated on.""The benefits of robotic surgery are plentiful, Hadomi says. Revision surgery — surgery to correct mistakes or tweak prior surgeries — are significantly lower with a robot assisting. The precision of the robot helps to curb potential errors, he says.Last October, Mazor unveiled the results of a 379-patient study. It found a fivefold reduction of complications for surgeries performed with its Mazor robotic surgery technology. Notably, there was also a sevenfold reduction in revision surgery compared with freehand lumbar fusion surgeries.""There's no doubt from the patient's perspective, I would not consider going to surgery without the robot there knowing the chance of going through revision (surgery) is seven times higher,"" he said. Revision surgery is also costly for the hospital, which can face reimbursement hurdles.All agree that robotic surgery won't replace human surgeons. Hadomi likens his system and others like it to ""the toolbox of the surgeon"". These are simply medical technology tools that make operating easier on the surgeon and safer for the patient, he says.The benefits are also growing for investors, says Robo Global's Capron.""What's really exciting is the fact that we are at an inflection point where the technologies that enable robotic surgeries and the price point are attractive,"" he said. ""Now there's a lot of action around J&J and Medtronic. I see that as confirmation that this is a substantial, addressable market.""RELATED:Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

171,ADS,"With recent Dropbox (DBX) and Spotify Technology (SPOT) IPOs, here's one simple lesson to be learned from the initial public offerings of Facebook (FB), Alibaba (BABA), Snap (SNAP) and Square (SQ): Big-buzz IPOs don't always live up to the hype — at least not at first.X Buying a stock right when it has an IPO is a high-risk proposition, regardless of how convincing the hype may seem.Facebook, Alibaba, Snap and Square all headed south from their second week of trading, providing clear examples of why you should wait for a new IPO to form its first base before you invest.It's an important rule to keep in mind when evaluating IPO stocks like Dropbox, which just went public in March, and Spotify, which started trading in April.The Spotify IPO is technically referred to as a direct listing. This approach allows Spotify to avoid having bankers set the initial share price in a typical order book creation. The music streaming service has hit many of the right notes since its IPO and is now 6% a recent breakout.Dropbox had been on the same trajectory as Spotify, but that changed this week. After a heavy volume breakout on June 14, Dropbox's stock has dropped sharply over the last four days. The cloud-based storage stock is now back below its 34.93 buy point.The same lessons about how to buy IPO stocks apply to top 2017 new issues like Floor & Decor (FND), Canada Goose (GOOS), Smart Global (SGH) and Roku (ROKU).Zscaler (ZS) and Carbon Black (CBLK), both of which went public this year, have also had their fair share of post-IPO volatility.  Canada Goose has been one of the top IPO stocks in recent months, but it has also run into some selling pressure this week.The bottom line with all newer IPO stocks is that if you are going to trade them, you need to always follow a sound set of sell rules.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFrom its first weekly close on May 18, 2012, Facebook sank 54% over the next four months. Snap plunged 48% from its first weekly close on March 3 of this year until apparently finding a bottom in August. And after closing out its first week of trading on Nov. 20, 2015, Square fell 37% over the next 10 weeks.Keep in mind that if you take a 50% loss, you need a 100% gain just to get back to break-even.Alibaba fared better when it went public in September 2014, declining just 12% from its first weekly close while forming an IPO base.It did offer a buying opportunity when it broke out of that pattern in October, but the Chinese internet giant soon proved another point about new stocks: They can be quite volatile.After quickly rising as much as 20%, Alibaba reversed course, falling 47% from November 2014 until finding a bottom in September 2015. The stock continued to struggle and didn't really get going until it launched its current run with a breakout at the beginning of last year.Although many investors chose to ignore it amid all the buzz, Facebook flashed a serious warning sign before its IPO: a sharp slowdown in earnings growth.In the three quarters prior to going public, the company's EPS gains slowed from 100% to 25% to 9%. And in Facebook's first two reports as a publicly traded company, it posted 0% growth.It wasn't until about 14 months after its initial public offering that Team Zuckerberg finally found its mobile mojo and delivered a return to growth with earnings of 13 cents a share on a 58% gain in revenue for Q2 2013.Facebook bolted out of a double bottom on that report and made an impressive multi-year run, although the new Cambridge Analytica data breach has hammered Facebook's stock.Interestingly, it also took Square about 14 months of roller-coaster action before it found its market legs and began to climb. It's no coincidence that the provider of payment-processing software started to climb as its earnings growth started to improve.Square pulled back last November after a sharp climb, but has bounced back to form two new bases and and launch two new breakouts. The stock is now over 10% above its most recent buy point.Premium outerwear maker Canada Goose is yet another example of why it's important to give a new IPO time to set up. Since going public in March 2017, the Toronto-based stock has formed multiple bases, including a cup with handle that it broke out of in November. Canada Goose soared 41% last week on earnings, but has reversed somewhat to give back a piece of those huge gains this week.Specialty retailer Floor & Decor, which went public last April, pulled back after forming an IPO base, but went on to build a 26-week long cup with handle. Since then the stock has struggled to make a sustained upward move and is now testing support at its 10-week line.And then there was Snap.After heading due south for months after it went public, the Snapchat parent seemed to have found a bottom in mid-August, then popped in early February on its Q4 earnings report. But Snap has once again broken down and is now trying to find support at its 10-week moving average, which has fallen below its 40-week line. In addition to its chart action, keep in mind that unlike Alibaba, Facebook and Square, Snap has no profits.So while Snap may go on to make a nice run, the jury is still out.Buying a brand-new IPO can be tempting, but it can also be costly and painful.As the examples above show, you can significantly reduce your risk and still reap plenty of rewards if you follow these three steps:In other words, just like with any stock, make an IPO prove its fundamental and technical strength before you invest.If the pre-IPO buzz turns into a bust, you'll be glad you stayed out. And if the hype turns out to be true, you'll still have plenty of chances to profit.RELATED:Track Today's Top-Performing IPOsUse This Buying Checklist To Review A Stock Before You BuyNetflix, Nvidia Reveal 3 Telltale Clues To Look For In Stock Charts

The second bucket holds dynamic growth stocks — stocks in newer industries with rapid growth. The third bucket holds cyclical growth stocks. Operating in more economically sensitive sectors, they may be more volatile.Abiomed is in the dynamic growth bucket. The stock replaced leisure-lodging stock Wyndham Worldwide (WYN) in the S&P 500 index.

""It works substantially better than all preceding technologies.""The company's market opportunity is about 10 times what its market is today, Kelly says, as its technology grabs market share over the next five to 10 years.Alibaba is another dynamic growth holding. It is the leading e-commerce platform in China, and its share is growing.""Alibaba is pursuing four markets that are extremely large,"" Burton said. ""The first is its traditional e-commerce business in China. The second is digital advertising. As the company adds e-commerce customers, it boosts its advertising business. The third is its cloud computing business. As it builds its online infrastructure, it can sell that service to other companies. And the fourth is its emerging retail business. It is taking its e-commerce and logistics expertise and applying them to grocery and food delivery, where there is a massive total available market opportunity.""Alibaba is a member of the IBD 50 roster of growth stocks. So are Netflix and Abiomed.Amazon, which is on IBD's Leaderboard, is in the fund's consistent growers bucket. The stock barely paused when it recently took heat amid news that one of the company's Echo smart-speaker devices recorded a couple's private conversation in their home and sent it to someone on their contact list without their knowledge.""Amazon is our largest holding,"" Kelly said. ""We're still excited about their two main businesses. The first is retail, which still has a tremendous runway to go. They have 5% of total retail transactions in the U.S., but they get 20% of the total growth. That indicates that they will get to 20% of the total market, so the opportunity is four times what it is today.""Amazon Web Services is the second business that Kelly and Burton like. ""We think it is in the early stages of moving corporate work flows from on-premises software to the cloud. Their technology for doing this is in the front of the industry, so they should remain the leader, with Microsoft (MSFT) number two, and that's why Microsoft is our second largest holding.""Among other holdings, ASML (ASML) is in the fund's cyclical growth bucket. The Dutch-based company is a manufacturer of lithography systems used to manufacture integrated circuits. Its shares are up 15% this year.""ASML has two key drivers,"" Burton said. ""First is global demand for semiconductor chips, which is expanding at two-plus times the growth rate of global GDP. It's driven by growth in cloud computing and mobile communications.""Burton likes ASML's EUV technology. ""It stands for extreme ultraviolet, and it helps makers of chips.

Volume is running at a 127% faster than usual pace after Goldman Sachs reportedly boosted its long-term price target to $490 from $390. Analyst Heath Terry forecast that in 2019 the video streaming firm would garner 32.5 million net new subscribers. That well exceeds Wall Street's consensus estimate of 26 million net new adds.The very best companies in terms of fundamentals and stock price strength are able to launch breakouts from third, fourth, and even fifth stage bases. But later-stage bases always carry a higher risk of failure and a significant price correction.Netflix hauled out of a first-stage base at 107.07 in October 2016, then broke out again in the week ended July 21, 2017. Shares cleared a 166.97 buy point in a six-week cuplike base, then ramped up more than 20% before forming a third-stage base.More recently, Netflix surpassed a 338.92 follow-on entry point after testing support at the 10-week moving average in both March and April.In the year 2009, Netflix scored $1.67 billion in annual revenue. Last year, the top line grew 32% vs. the prior year to $11.69 billion. So over the past eight years, Netflix's revenue has not only risen 600%, but it's also achieved a compounded annual growth rate of 27%.Earnings have climbed from 28 cents a share to $1.25 over the same time frame.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see the Los Gatos, Calif., company growing earnings 129% this year to $2.86 a share on a 38% jump in revenue to $16.1 billion.The Street also sees Netflix's top line shattering the $20 billion barrier in 2019.Other FAANG stocks continue to act well.Alphabet (GOOGL) edged up 0.2% for a third up day in a row. The Google search engine owner has formed a seven-day handle on its new double bottom.In Alphabet's double bottom base, the second sell-off took shares down to 984, undercutting the early February sell-off low of 997.An undercut of the first low is good action within this type of base, and the middle peak in between the two sell-offs plus 10 cents offers a standard buy point.So in Alphabet's case, the buy point of 1,178.26 offers a proper entry for growth investors. But the new downward slanting handle, formed in light volume, offers a lower buy point at 1,161.20.Microsoft (MSFT), part of the so-called ""FAAMG"" megacap tech clan, continues to inch higher and is near new highs. At 101.33, the cloud computing, business software and computer and video game console giant remains within the 5% buy zone after a breakout past 97.34 in a six-week flat base.In the March-ended fiscal third quarter, Microsoft posted a 16% boost in earnings to 95 cents a share. That's on top of a 30% increase in the year-ago quarter. Fiscal Q3 revenue accelerated 16% to $26.82 billion. That marked the biggest year-over-year top-line increase in 14 quarters.In other stocks today, TAL Education (TAL), ranking No. 9 in the IBD 50, fell sharply on reports that short selling firm Muddy Waters said it's sold shares short. The Carson Block-led firm reportedly accused the for-profit school operator of overstating its earnings from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2018, ended in February that year.The stock slumped as much 16% to a session low of 38.41 before recouping some of those losses. The stock undercut the 50-day moving average but quickly gained institutional buying support.On May 10, TAL broke out of a six-week cup without handle, but heavy volume was absent. Ideally, a breakout should involve a minimum 40% to 50% increase in volume vs. the 50-day average.All daily charts in Investors.com and MarketSmith show the 50-day average turnover as a red line drawn across the volume bars at the bottom of each chart.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on growth stocks, charts, buy points, proper sell signals, and financial markets.)RELATED:How Are The Top Growth Stocks Faring?

177,ADS,"Even though it's been pummeled many times for its role in exposing private data on millions of people, Facebook stock remains a favorite with investors.XShares of the social media giant closed at 203.23, up 2.4% on the stock market today. Facebook stock hit all-time high of 203.55 on June 20.Facebook (FB) came under scrutiny in early February after it was revealed that political consultant Cambridge Analytica had wrongfully accessed personal data from 87 million Facebook users. Hackers allegedly used the data in the 2016 presidential election. It also led to Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg facing 10 hours of congressional testimony over two days.As reports of the data-privacy breach grew, Facebook stock dropped 23% in one month, starting in early February. Facebook stock has since rebounded about 36% thanks in part to Mark Zuckerberg's long apology tour.Despite its troubles, Facebook continues its consistent pace of double-digit growth in revenue and earnings. In reports, analysts often point to the success of Instagram, Facebook's photo and video-sharing app with more than 1 billion users.BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield on Thursday raised his price target on Facebook stock to 275 from 175, with a buy rating.""Instagram has become an absolute monster in terms of user growth and engagement,"" he wrote in a research note to clients.Facebook has steadily monetized Instagram with ads.

It combines your two favorite things: warm lighting and llamas.""This was a real advertisement from retail brand Cost Plus World Market. Such overly personalized ads alienate many shoppers. Three in four consumers say highly personalized ads, as well as marketers' requests for personal information, are ""creepy.""Despite the risk of spooking customers, most marketing departments still closely monitor customers' purchase and browsing histories. For more than a decade, this has been the only way to construct accurate customer profiles and send them relevant ads.Fortunately, there's now a better way. Thanks to artificial intelligence, marketers can create targeted ads based on just a few anonymous data points. This ""probabilistic"" marketing model generates strong sales without creeping out customers or exposing firms to legal and reputational risk in the event of data breaches.For years, marketing departments have been caught in a Catch-22.If they didn't collect enough data to personalize customers' shopping experiences, they'd forego billions in revenue. In 2016, businesses collectively missed out on $756 billion in sales by failing to personalize, according to Accenture.But if they did collect customer data, firms risked losing customers' trust. Consider what happened to Facebook (FB) when 87 million users learned that Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm, secretly scraped their data from the social media site.After the story broke, the company lost $50 billion in market value in just a few days. CEO Mark Zuckerberg was dragged to Capitol Hill to testify before Congress.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBrands can escape this no-win situation by changing how they target customers.Right now, most companies use ""deterministic"" data modeling. When a customer logs into a site with his username and password, a brand can follow his actions and suggest future purchases.With probabilistic data modeling, brands don't digitally stalk the customer. Instead, they create an anonymous profile of a person with a few known preferences.For example, they may know that a certain customer is a 26-year-old male who enjoys science fiction. Based on that information, the brand can use artificial intelligence to infer what that anonymous customer will probably also like.AI can be used to analyze millions of podcasts, books, hotels, designers, artists, and cafes and generate billions of cultural correlations. For instance, Spotify could use AI to learn that anyone who listens to a particular artist is also likely to shop at H&M.Spotify could then sell H&M the right to run ads whenever people play songs by that artist.Probabilistic data keeps consumers' identities secure and also allows brands to gain insights from a much wider array of consumer-related topics and interests.Chipotle could find out which podcasts its users probably enjoy. American Express could predict where a subset of customers will travel this summer on vacation. Nike could predict which Hulu shows its customers probably watch.Probabilistic cultural correlations are highly reliable.Consider Amazon's ""you may also like"" recommendation engine. By leveraging probabilistic, anonymous data, Amazon can expose consumers who have clicked on certain products to similar products that might interest them. The engine drives over 30% of the tech giant's sales.Or consider my company Qloo. Given specific preferences in one cultural domain, say food or music, Qloo's cultural AI can accurately infer relevance for a given entity in a different domain 55% of the time, on average. With two known preferences, that number jumps to 75%, and with three, more than 90%Soon, using anonymized probabilistic data may become a financial imperative.The European Union's General Data Protection Regulations, which went into effect last month, aim to ""give citizens back control of their personal data"" by implementing a higher standard for data protection and privacy.In theory, the rules only apply within the EU. But in practice, all multinational companies with a significant European presence must adhere to them, since it'd be difficult to separate the data of EU users from non-EU residents. The EU plans to fine companies up to 4% of their global annual revenue if they refuse to comply.Luckily, aside from probabilistic data, companies have another modern data privacy tool at their disposal — blockchain.Blockchain decentralizes databases ranging from title insurance to social identities, so that no single corporate entity owns the data.Essentially, it gives consumers private keys to their own data in a public domain. It won't be long before consumers will have complete control over which companies see data on their tastes and preferences and when, perhaps even rendering GDPR regulations moot.Consumers don't like it when brands stalk them and pinpoint who they are, even if it eventually leads to a cool llama lamp. Eventually, blockchain will give consumers full sovereignty over their data. Until and even after then, companies can use AI to better divine consumers' preferences without ever collecting terabytes of data on precise identities.Zuckerberg Starts Talking, And Makes Facebook's Problems Even WorseCould Blockchain Be A Bigger Disrupter Than The Internet?The End Of Money As We Know It?More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

180,ADS,"LOS ANGELES — Esports are a big theme at this year's E3 video game expo, but the primary focus has been on fighting games. The NBA 2K League is trying to stand out from the crowd with its professional esports league built around Take-Two Interactive Software's (TTWO) popular basketball simulation game.The NBA 2K League, a joint venture of the National Basketball Association and Take-Two, brought league officials and three top players to E3 Tuesday for a media roundtable.Now in its inaugural season, the NBA 2K League has faced a good amount of skepticism. Critics wonder whether fans will want to follow a virtual sport when a real-world version of the game already exists.Brendan Donohue, NBA 2K League managing director, said the league has a number of business advantages compared with other esports for games like ""League of Legends"" from Tencent (TCEHY)-owned Riot Games or ""Overwatch"" from Activision Blizzard (ATVI).Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

""We're lucky that our game is globally recognizable.""Several companies were hosting esports competitions at E3 this week.

The 17 teams in the league chose them following two stages of qualifying and out of 72,000 hopefuls.Teams compete in five-on-five gameplay using unique characters, not existing NBA players.

Games are streamed on Amazon (AMZN)-owned Twitch.The season runs for 17 weeks, beginning in May and ending in August. There are 12 weeks of weekly matchups, followed by three weeks of in-season tournaments and two weeks of postseason play.The league is already planning for the second season, Donohue said. It is looking to add more teams, perhaps even outside the U.S., he said.""Our NBA owners are extremely bullish on esports,"" Donohue said, and not just in the NBA 2K League. Riot Games recently sold 10 franchises for a ""League of Legends"" professional league in North America and seven of those have NBA ownership, he said.

Shares broke out of a cup base at an 18.70 buy point earlier in the week.

"
198,ADS,"Check out the way Facebook stock has responded to the data-breach scandal that smacked the company earlier this year, and it seems clear the social networking giant's long apology tour has helped lift the stock.XOn the public relations and Facebook (FB) news pages of the company's website, there are headlines such as ""Removing Bad Actors From Facebook."" It says Facebook took down 2.5 million pieces of hate speech and disabled 583 million fake accounts in the first quarter of 2018. Further, the company is still running a media blitz that started in May called ""Facing Facts,"" an explanatory campaign that includes national commercial broadcasts and regular messages to Facebook users.Facebook also is trying to keep users updated on what it's doing to prevent false news and how its fact-checking program is working. It has pledged to commit a task force of 20,000 people to get the job done.Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights, has called the data breach the darkest chapter in Facebook's 14-year history. Still, he says, the fundamental damage to the social network's platform has been ""very contained.""""We're seeing minimal damage over the last few months, in terms of user engagement, trends and advertising,"" said Ives. ""Facebook is going through a hand-holding period with users, regulators and app developers to make sure these things can't be repeated.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAs details of the data breach emerged, Facebook stock plunged 24% from a high of 195.32 on Feb. 1 to a one-year low of 149.02 on March 26. But the stock has rebounded 32% since then, indicating Facebook's mea culpa and recovery plan is working. Facebook stock surged to another all-time high of 203.55 on June 20. On Monday, shares gained 1.6% to close at 197.36 on the stock market today.Facebook's data breach involved research firm Cambridge Analytica and its access to personal information from 87 million users of the social network. The breach seeped its way into the U.S. presidential election of 2016, due to its connection with alleged Russian meddling.In subsequent congressional hearings, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg was dragged before both House and Senate panels, giving 10 hours worth of testimony. Since then, Facebook has faced a storm of criticism from users, advertisers and regulators over the past few months, both in the U.S. and Europe.Facebook's troubles helped spur the European Union into implementing the General Data Protection Regulation, which created data protection rules across Europe. It took effect in May, and Facebook and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google unit already have complied.But it has also raised a question as to whether digital advertising revenue at Facebook and Google will be impacted long-term by a regulatory wave in Europe and in the U.S.""It's created some disruption but I think the bark is worse than the bite,"" said GBH's Ives. Ives has a rating of highly attractive on Facebook stock and price target of 225.Whatever troubles Facebook is facing hasn't slowed its consistent pace of double-digit growth in revenue and earnings. Facebook's first-quarter revenue jumped 49% from the year-ago period to $11.96 billion, along with 63% growth in earnings per share.For the second quarter, analysts are looking for Facebook to report revenue growth of 43% to $13.3 billion. They also see 30% growth in earnings per share.Working in Facebook's favor is its massive size. It has 2.2 billion monthly active users, one-third of the world's global population. That's up 14% from the same period a year ago. About 1.45 billion people log on daily, spending an average of 20 minutes per visit.Put it all together and Facebook has enormous influence among advertisers, which account for about 96% of its revenue. Facebook's clout, resulting from the large amount of data it has on users, is matched only by Google. Combined, the two rake in about 60% of digital advertising spending. That includes Alphabet's YouTube.Other social networking sites, including Twitter (TWTR), Snap (SNAP), Pinterest and Yelp (YELP) have hardly put a dent in Facebook's armor.All this is occurring while Facebook stock still has several revenue-growth levers to pull. Its biggest ace-in-the-hole right now is Instagram, the photo- and video-sharing mobile platform that just surpassed 1 billion users. Compare that with Snap's Snapchat, which had 191 million users at the end of the first quarter.Facebook has steadily monetized Instagram with ads. The company does not break out Instagram revenue. It is, however, seen by analysts as a core revenue driver with a lot of room to accelerate.KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Andy Hargreaves believes ad revenue will more than double from a year ago to $8.9 billion. By 2020, he thinks Instagram will account for 26% of Facebook's total revenue.""As core Facebook matures, Instagram is the key to the next leg of growth,"" Hargreaves wrote in a report to clients this month. He has an overweight rating on Facebook and price target of 245.""Facebook continues to grow its core user base and increase the effectiveness of its advertising offerings, which, when combined with a massive opportunity to grow Instagram and monetize its messaging products, we believe creates a substantial opportunity for future growth for many years,"" he wrote.Another growth lever is the Facebook Messenger platform.This past month, analysts have spotted some of the first advertisements on Messenger. That includes ads from Staples, Uber and Peloton.""Just in the last two weeks we have seen consistent ads in Facebook Messenger for the first time,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said in a June 19 note to clients. Facebook Messenger has 1.3 billion monthly active users.Mahaney thinks Messenger could contribute $6 billion to $8 billion in revenue. That translates into $1 in earnings per share to the company by 2020. He has an outperform rating on Facebook and price target of 250.Another future growth lever is Facebook's other messaging platform, WhatsApp, with 1.5 billion users.There is one overhang out there that analysts are watching closely. The issue is whether younger users are abandoning the platform for social apps considered more ""cool,"" or other reasons. It's already happening, but not to a level that has yet threatened the stock, GBH's Ives says.Facebook had dominated the social media landscape among America's youth. But it no longer is the most popular online platform among teens, a recent Pew Research Center survey said. In a survey on Facebook and teenage usage, about half of U.S. teens ages 13 to 17 say they use Facebook, but they use YouTube, Instagram or Snapchat more often, in that order.Notably, it said 95% of those teens have a smartphone, with almost half saying they ""almost constantly"" use the internet. That's a big pool of advertising opportunity.""That's been a challenging demographic for them and speaks to why the Instagram acquisition will go down as one of Zuckerberg's best moves in the evolution of Facebook,"" said Ives.

202,ADS,"Don't feel bad if you've never heard of Baozun (BZUN). The China-based stock stands poised 8% below a proper buy point ahead of its earnings report due Thursday.When it comes to China internet stocks trading in the U.S., Baozun doesn't have anywhere near the name recognition of a Baidu (BIDU) or an Alibaba (BABA).But it does qualify as an IBD Sector Leader. And among non-China-based companies doing business over China's internet, Baozun is a leading brand. The company's website cites data from iResearch saying Baozun holds 22% of China's e-commerce solutions market.That is a big piece of business. China's online population rose by 40.7 million connected users in 2017 to 772 million, according to the China Internet Network Information Center. The number is well over double the entire population of the U.S.Baozun provides e-commerce systems to homegrown Chinese companies, as well as to non-China-based companies aiming to connect with China's avid internet shoppers. It assists client/partners including Nike (NKE), Microsoft (MSFT) and Dutch consumer electronics and industrial products titan Philips (PHG). It helps market and deliver products via Chinese retail venues such as Alibaba's Tmall and JD.com (JD).In addition, it helps spin products and promotions across social media platforms, such as WeChat and Weibo (WB).Baozun's enterprise product suite covers essentially the entire e-commerce arc. From IT solutions and store operations, to digital marketing, customer services, warehousing and fulfillment. Markets range from apparel, electronics, insurance, automobiles, food and health products, and home furnishings.The stock, which is listed on the Nasdaq, began trading on the U.S. market three years ago. It spent its first 15 months consolidating below its IPO price. It staged its first official breakout in May 2017. On Monday, the stock traded up 158% from that initial breakout. It was 339% above its IPO price.For the first quarter, analyst consensus projects a 14% EPS gain to a modest 8 cents. The company has either met or beat analysts' targets in the past four quarters. In the December quarter, Baozun topped earnings expectations by about 35%.It also has grown earnings by triple digits in six of the past nine quarters. Consensus estimates point to a 10% rise in revenue. That would be down sharply from Baozun's 25% average revenue gain over the past three quarters.Shares on Monday were about 8% below a 52.43 buy point in an eight-week base. The base is a third-stage pattern. Baozun plans to report early Thursday.Among the other China-based names set to report results this week: Vipshop Holdings (VIPS) and China Lodging (HTHT) report after Monday's close.

217,ADS,"The biggest oil stocks were slow to join the shale boom, but they're ready to pounce on what soon could be the next bonanza: deepwater oil drilling.XOnce too costly except when oil prices were at their highest levels, deepwater oil projects now can break even at price points similar to many low-cost shale fields. New technology and streamlined processes get the credit. Consider this: Crude prices can fall to $35 a barrel, less than half current levels, and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) could profit off the Vito deepwater oil project, 4,000 feet deep in the Gulf of Mexico.Shell gave the final green light to the Vito project in April, after slashing development costs by 70%. A month later it announced another deepwater oil discovery, also in the Gulf. This isn't a coincidence. The oil company plans to boost deepwater oil production by over 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, to more than 900,000 by 2020. This comes even as Shell ramps up shale activity in places like the Permian Basin.Shell is not alone. Other big oil stocks are again looking at deepwater oil projects, whose high costs made them ripe targets for cuts after crude oil prices collapsed in 2014. Deep-pocketed companies like Shell, Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) are uniquely positioned to capitalize on the potential boom. The steep startup costs of a deepwater drilling platform and rig mean only the biggest companies can afford to invest even as deepwater oil grows increasingly competitive with shale. And deepwater opportunities are wide open next to the crowded competition onshore, where many smaller companies are vying for land, labor and equipment.""A gap had emerged between offshore and onshore,"" said John Kerr, chief technology officer at BHGE's (BHGE) oilfield equipment unit, in an interview with IBD. ""The last three to four years we basically applied a strict diet into what was a historically expensive environment.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAnalysts caution against direct comparisons of deepwater oil drilling and shale, saying they are like apples and oranges. But in general, shale drilling is more nimble. That means companies can respond more quickly to price fluctuations by adjusting activity without sinking their cash flow. A well in the Permian can cost about $10 million.Deepwater oil projects, those that reach depths of 500 feet or more underwater, can require billions of dollars of total investment. And their complex, sprawling operations can't throttle back so easily. The Vito development, for example, will consist of eight subsea wells.However, once those upfront costs are sunk, so to speak, deepwater projects look different. Before oil crashed, they used to cost as much as $1 million a day in the Gulf of Mexico, according to Wood Mackenzie, an energy research company. Today that's down to $400,000 or less.The steep rate of decline for shale well production also requires companies to ramp up drilling just to keep a shale project's output steady, driving up costs. A typical onshore shale well's output drops off 60%-80% in 12 months, said James Williams, an economist at energy consultant WTRG. But a typical offshore well has a 10%-12% drop-off rate in 12 months.And because deepwater oil plays have orders of magnitude more oil than shale plays do, costs are spread out over more barrels. Oil exploration and production company Hess (HESS) said unit development costs for its Liza deepwater project off Guyana are about $7 barrel. Compare that with $12 a barrel seen in the Permian's Delaware Basin.""The Delaware Basin is a great place to invest your money but Guyana is even better,"" CEO John Hess said in May, according to E&P Magazine.In fact, Guyana is among the most interesting deepwater basins in the world, Andrew Latham, vice president of exploration research at Wood Mackenzie, told IBD. He noted that Exxon Mobil and Hess make discoveries with almost every well they drill in the region.""They are basically going to where geology is favorable,"" he said. ""The focus is on quality, going after very productive reservoirs.""He is also bullish on the potential in Brazil, Gulf of Mexico, Senegal and the eastern edge of the Mediterranean Sea near Egypt and Cyprus.One of those areas could be the next ""super basin,"" another windfall for oil stocks on the scale of the Permian.At the CERAWeek energy conference in March, the chief exploration officer at Italy's Eni (E) mentioned the Santos basin in Brazil, saying deepwater can be profitable with oil prices at $50 per barrel.Also at CERAWeek, BHP Billiton's (BHP) exploration chief said the company is focusing on the Gulf of Mexico, Western Australia and the Caribbean.In the Gulf of Mexico alone, an estimated 2.5 billion barrels in ultra high-pressure fields have been discovered, says William Turner, who analyzes the Gulf for Wood Mackenzie. And there are likely even more discoveries in the Gulf that companies haven't reported yet.Companies don't have approvals yet to use the technology that can tap into them. But once approvals start, oil firms like Total (TOT) and Chevron will start drilling and report more ultra deepwater finds, he says.If oil is at $70 a barrel, Wood Mackenzie estimates more than 69 billion barrels of deepwater oil are profitable worldwide as well as 31 billion barrels of oil equivalent of gas.As it did with shale projects, the oil crash forced deepwater project managers to find ways to streamline.Companies used their best drilling and completion crews. The ones that didn't cut it didn't make it during the downturn.Increased coordination between drilling and surface teams helped them get the job done right the first time. Or, if there was a problem, they were able to fix it more quickly.Companies also used off-the-shelf drilling platform technology instead of costlier bespoke equipment.""The two big areas they have worked on are drilling expenses and facility expenses,"" Judson Jacobs, senior research director of upstream operations at research firm IHS, told IBD. ""Largely what they've done is become more efficient with how they drill.""The time between a deepwater discovery and the start of production is now about three to five years, instead of seven years as in the past, according to Bob Fryklund, chief strategist for IHS' upstream division.So what might've been a ""long-cycle"" project is now a medium-term one, making it more competitive, he says.Another technique gaining interest is subsea processing. That's where oil processing takes place on the seafloor instead of the ocean's surface.""What drives the costs the most is the topside, what you have to put on the surface,"" Fryklund said. ""We can now put a lot of stuff on the floor.""Oil companies could reduce costs by an additional 30%-50% with newer technology and higher levels of data analytics, Jacobs says.For example, 3D printing has improved the turnaround time for repairing and replacing parts.In the future, artificial intelligence and robotics will further cut costs for deepwater drillers.Among the big oil stocks, BP (BP) already uses magnetic crawler robots to scour for cracks in pipes in some Gulf of Mexico projects. Later this year, Total will deploy a robot to look for gas leaks in its North Sea operations off the coast of Western Europe.Tech advances are also enabling more remote drilling, says Kishore Sundararajan, chief engineering officer at BHGE's oilfield services unit. And since space on the rig is the most expensive real estate on a deepwater project, moving personnel off the rig via remote operations saves money.The Trump administration plans to open new areas to the oil industry. Nearly the entire U.S. coastline would be fair game.The Northeast Atlantic, which hasn't seen drilling since the 1970s, could be a particularly attractive spot for oil companies, Fryklund says.The Trump administration also wants to remove regulations imposed after the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon disaster. Those rules added to the industry's production costs, worsening the downturn seen a few years later.""With the Trump administration, there is expectation they are going to review some of the more stringent offshore drilling rules in the U.S."" that resulted from overregulation, according to Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group. ""Expect to see a more friendly environment for producers to come in.""Still, Flynn says, BP's disaster-related expenses, which are about $65 billion, could be a deterrent against lax safety that regulators can't provide.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Oil Stocks And Industry NewsWhy Oil Stocks Are Getting Slammed On The Stock MarketHere's The Clearest Sign Yet That The Biggest IPO Ever Is On HoldBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

These law-abiding newcomers must feel like idiots, watching what's happening on the southern border.Hundreds of thousands of Central American migrants are walking right in. They're not waiting in line. They're using ""asylum"" requests as their E-ZPass. Just 12% of requests from El Salvadorans, 11% from Guatemalans and 7.5% from Hondurans are actually granted, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Never mind, the request gets them in.It's a shameful distortion of a program intended to provide a haven for true victims of state-sponsored religious, ethnic and political persecution. The U.S. offered asylum to Hungarian anti-communists after their uprising was crushed by the Soviets in 1956; to Cubans fleeing Castro's prisons; to Vietnamese after the fall of Saigon to the Communists in 1975; to Chinese political dissidents escaping the crackdown after Tiananmen Square in 1989; and more recently, to Chinese Christians and Muslims threatened for practicing their religion.Not to be confused with what's happening on the southern border. Migrants walk up to a border agent with a familiar story. Women typically plead they're victims of an abusive boyfriend or husband, and men claim they're escaping gang violence. They're detained briefly, but many are then released into the United States and given a date for an asylum hearing.Being granted asylum means hitting the jackpot. Asylees get the Refugee Cash Assistance program, including medical care, a housing allowance and hundreds of dollars a month in cash. All inclusive, as the Sandals getaway ads say. In contrast, immigrants who go the green card route are ineligible for most benefits for years.Half who use asylum as their excuse for crossing the border never even file a claim or show up at a hearing. They're also winners. After all, they made it inside the U.S., unlike the East Asian waiting 12 years to enter as a legal worker.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLast weekend, open borders advocates held 700 marches across the country, protesting the Trump administration's policies. One target was Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recent clarification that domestic abuse is not sufficient grounds for seeking asylum. A few immigration judges have granted asylum on those grounds, but it's not how asylum is defined.House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., accused Sessions of ""staggering cruelty."" But Sessions is right. The asylum law ""is not a general hardship statute,"" he says. If every hardship qualifies for asylum, it will mean everyone can come in.That's the marchers' objective. And increasingly the goal of the progressive flank of the Democratic Party. Their rhetoric suggests any limit on immigration is a crime against humanity. New Yorkers like Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who toppled Congressman Joe Crowley last week, and Cynthia Nixon, running to unseat Gov. Andrew Cuomo, are calling for the abolition of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency.A similar battle is raging inside the European Union, which is overwhelmed by mostly bogus asylum claims from North African migrants. More than 70% of their claims are rejected, according to special envoy of the U.N. High Commission on Refugees, Vincent Cochetel. But the migrants who are turned down for asylum stay anyway, eluding deportation. They're straining public schools and government benefits and provoking a backlash against German Chancellor Angela Merkel's government.Last weekend, EU leaders tentatively devised a plan to screen asylum seekers in disembarkation centers along the North African coast, before they make their way across the Mediterranean to Europe. Trump is proposing something similar to vet asylum applicants on the Mexican side of our southern border, before they enter the U.S.In America and Europe, demagogues tell us to have a heart and let everybody in. But the public understands that immigration affects public schools, wages, taxes, even cultural identity. That's why we have immigration laws.The aspiring Americans who obey those laws and wait their turn deserve our respect. Allowing other immigrants to jump in front of them using flimsy asylum claims is a slap in the face.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

230,ADS,"Biogen (BIIB) could benefit from a ""fear-of-missing-out rally"" as it closes in on pivotal data for its Alzheimer's disease treatment, aducanumab, an analyst said this week as he upgraded the stock.Canaccord analyst Sumant Kulkarni updated Biogen to a buy rating from hold, though he trimmed his price target to 335 from 350. The new price target is based on conservative expectations for sales of spinal muscular drug Spinraza, he said in a report to clients.""We acknowledge our call could be early especially as multiple sclerosis/Spinraza dynamics play out in the coming quarters,"" he said. ""That said, we like the potential for the stock to benefit from a fear-of-missing-out rally as more data points crop up on Biogen's high-stakes Alzheimer's disease pipeline.""On the stock market today, Biogen slipped 0.2% to close at 293.96. Biogen stock is consolidating with a buy point at 370.67. Shares of other biotech companies collectively lifted 2.1%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBiogen is working on a number of Alzheimer's disease treatments, including aducanumab and a drug partnered with Eisai called BAN2401. Aducanumab data isn't expected until 2019 or 2020. Meanwhile, investors aren't hopeful for data from an 18-month study of BAN2401 in the third quarter.The 18-month study of BAN2401 could have some impact on expectations for aducanumab, he said. So far, aducanumab has shown some promise. Kulkarni sees a 35% chance aducanumab will get approval to treat Alzheimer's disease. He noted stocks tend to be volatile on Alzheimer's news.Aducanumab has been largely devoid of scares thus far, Kulkarni said. In February, Biogen increased the size of a study of aducanumab by 510 patients. That sent Biogen shares diving 6.6%. About the same time, Dow Jones component Merck (MRK) scrapped its studies of an Alzheimer's disease treatment.Still, ""the Alzheimer's disease market is large enough for Biogen to benefit from a fear of missing out in case positives emerge,"" he said.Kulkarni sees multiple sclerosis drug sales accounting for about 67% of Biogen's total revenue in 2018. Risks in that segment include rivalry from Roche's (RHHBY) drug Ocrevus — though Biogen gets a royalty on those sales — and drug-pricing concerns.""While that risk (of headwinds) still remains, we note that Biogen's prescription share, at least in the U.S., appears to have been stabilizing,"" he said. ""We will continue to monitor trends closely, and are also mindful that it may be too early to ascertain the effects of initiatives such as value-based pricing.""Multiple sclerosis is often cited as an ""expensive"" condition to treat. In general, though, the frequency of price increases for these drugs has slowed from twice per year to once annually. Further, generics from the likes of Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) could eventually take share.For now, however, Biogen looks safe. Multiple sclerosis patients tend to stick with branded medicines and don't seem to see their doctors as often, Kulkarni said.Sales of spinal muscular atrophy drug Spinraza could be choppy on its loading dose schedule. Patients receive four loading doses in quick succession before moving to maintenance doses every four months. This means sales-per-patient peter off when they move to maintenance doses.""It is our view that investors were generally caught by surprise by the fast launch, and are now somewhat more pessimistic on the product given the most recent quarterly performance,"" he said.Further, Novartis (NVS) could compete now that it has acquired spinal muscular atrophy player AveXis.RELATED:How Much Volume Should You Look For In A Stock?Long-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFsStill The No. 1 Rule For Stock Investors: Cut Your Losses Short

236,ADS,"Two of China's biggest internet names appeared on IBD's Global Leaders screen in the past few days. Both Alibaba Group (BABA) and Baidu (BIDU) are rising fast and climbing the right side of interesting base patterns.Alibaba is getting close to a 201.60 buy point in a third-stage, double-bottom base.The Hangzhou-based company on May 4 delivered fiscal Q4 results that muscled past analyst estimates. Revenue growth accelerated to 76%, while earnings rose 44%. Cloud-computing revenue more than doubled, to $699 million (still less than 10% of the giant's total take for the quarter).Alibaba's annual active users grew to 552 million, up 37 million from a year earlier. It also added 37 million new active monthly mobile users, bringing its total to 617 million.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseForbes reported Wednesday that Alibaba was investing nearly $160 billion to grow ""their cashless ecosystem of street vendors across China."" Street vendors, generally selling different sorts of food items, receive a vendor code from Alibaba. Customers can then scan the code to pay, Forbes said.Linked to the Chinese government's effort to implement a cashless system across the country, Alibaba's program allows street vendors to take loans for up to three years to participate in the system.Reports also surfaced that Alibaba bought Berlin-based Rocket Internet's Daraz unit. Daraz is an online apparel and accessories store operating across Mynamar, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.The chart pattern for another heavyweight China internet play, search engine Baidu, is more challenging.One interpretation of its chart would be a cup with handle starting in mid-March with a 257.40 buy point. That reading would place the stock near the top of the buy range that goes to 270.27.In this view, the cup with handle formed after a double-bottom base failed when the stock triggered an automatic sell rule by dropping more than 8% below the 265.87 buy point.On May 8, Baidu cleared the 257.40 buy point but in only moderate trade. Volume has not yet kicked in to confirm that advance as a breakout. Yet the stock is acting well.That means a significant move in heavy volume above conventional entries at either 270.68 or 275.07 could mark another breakout.For its first quarter, Baidu reported a 108% earnings gain alongside a 36% rise in revenue. Earnings in particular were far above analyst forecasts. The company said it plans this year to sell its majority stake in iQiyi (IQ), the streaming video unit Baidu spun off in March. The IPO has yet to turn a profit, but reportedly generates about 20% of Baidu's revenue.A May 2 report from Trefis projected that Baidu would grow its profit margin from 26% in Q1 to 27.3% by the end of the year (aided by the offloading of iQiyi). That would enable a 40% increase in operating profit for the year, the note said.

237,ADS,"It's not hard to find top growth stocks in IBD's Sector Leaders screen. ZTO Express (ZTO), one of many top growth stocks based in China, debuted in Monday's screen. The screen also includes China names Baozun (BZUN) and Alibaba (BABA).ZTO Express is an express delivery firm with a market capitalization of around $12.8 billion. It's very liquid with an average daily volume of 2.7 million shares.It was an inauspicious debut for ZTO Express when it went public in October 2016 at 19.50 a share. The good news at the time was that it priced above the proposed range of 16.50 to 18.50 a share. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs were the underwriters. The bad news is that the stock headed lower after its first week of trading. Shares fell about 35% over the next four months.Fast forward to today, however, and a booming e-commerce market in China is fueling growth at ZTO Express. Just like UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX) deliver packages for Amazon.com (AMZN), ZTO Express does the same for Alibaba.Earlier this month, the company reported adjusted profit of 17 cents a share, up 70% from the year-ago quarter. The results marked the second straight quarter of accelerating growth. Sales growth, meanwhile, accelerated for the fourth straight quarter, rising 48% to $563.4 million.Parcel volume in the fourth quarter totaled 2.015 billion, up 35.8% from the year-ago period. Full-year parcel volume in 2017 increased 38.3% from 2016. Parcel volume market share increased 15.5% in 2017 from 14.4% in 2016.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The conventional entry is 18.18, 10 cents above the Nov. 10 intraday high of 18.08.Since ZTO Express is relatively new as a publicly traded company, fund sponsorship is on the light side.At the end of Q4, 155 funds owned shares.

238,ADS,"With as many as seven oil and gas-related industry groups rising 1.8% or more in stocks today, an investor shouldn't be surprised to see more names in that sector run to new highs. On Thursday, they included brand-new IPO Apergy (APY), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA), and oil drilling firm Transocean (RIG).Apergy, which debuted on the NYSE as a spinoff of industrial equipment firm Dover (DOV) on May 9, moved to a new high after rising 4.3% to close at 43.90. That marked a fourth straight advance.While cup bases should be a minimum six weeks in length and flat bases at least five weeks, IPO bases can be extraordinarily narrow in width, as short as seven days. In Apergy's case, the five-day pullback was too short to be a proper IPO base.Apergy hit a high of 43.11 on its market debut, then fell the next two sessions. Notice on a daily chart how Apergy refused to go below the intraday low of its first trading session as an independent new company.That said, what tail winds benefit the drilling technology expert?Apergy's oil drilling industry group has scaled up the six-month performance rankings among IBD's 197 industry groups. As of Wednesday's close, the group ranked No. 22, up from No. 91 just six weeks ago.Given that oil is a commodity and thus the industry is highly cyclical, investors should expect Apergy's annual results to swing. And swing they have.In 2014, the Woodlands, Texas-based firm earned a robust $2.88 a share. But the next year, earnings plunged 77% to 67 cents a share. And in 2016, Apergy suffered a net loss of 16 cents a share. In 2017, it returned to the black, earning $1.43 a share as sales picked up 34% to $1.01 billion.Sales fell sharply in 2015 and 2016, down 30% in both of those years.Analysts expect Apergy's earnings to fall 11% to 32 cents a share in the first quarter of 2018.Apergy's products include plunger lifts, rod pumping systems, progressive cavity pumps, and electric submersible pump systems.Transocean, Apergy's industry group mate, rallied past 14 for the first time in more than 14 months. The stock climbed 0.11 to 13.71 after erasing most of the day's gains.Transocean is climbing out of a deep first-stage bottoming base. Go to a monthly chart, and you'll see why. The stock remains 92% below an all-time peak of 163, set in May 2008. (Go to MarketSmith to see historical daily, weekly and monthly charts.)In the near term, the global expert in offshore deep-ocean drilling surpassed a 12.50 buy point in a 13-week cup without handle on April 18. The stock didn't get very far, though, and pulled back for nearly three weeks. That decline, in turn, can be seen as a downward slanting handle on the giant cup base.Thus, a new buy point emerged at 12.85, 10 cents above the handle's high. Transocean rushed past that new entry on May 9 in excellent volume, up 65% vs. its 50-day average.Meanwhile, Royal Dutch Shell, the global integrated energy giant, rose more than 1% to 73.33 in about average volume. On May 9, the stock cleared a 71.79 buy point in a nearly 15-week cup with handle.Royal Dutch Shell remains in buy range. The 5% buy zone goes up to 75.38.In other sectors, Baozun (BZUN) gained more than 18% as it moved past a 52.43 buy point in an undefined seven-week cuplike base.

So the Chinese use platforms like WeChat and Alibaba.Now the Chinese government takes data from those platforms to assign all people who use them a ""social credit score.""In other words, the government monitors your web activity and gives you a grade. Your purchases, social interactions and political activity will determine what privileges you get.Having a low score — because you smoke, are slow to pay bills or criticize a government official — could get you barred from flying, using certain hotels or sending your kids to better schools.Li Schoolland grew up in China. As a teenager, she survived China's Great Leap Forward, Great Famine and Cultural Revolution. Her parents were doctors, which meant they, and she, were intellectual enough to be targeted for communist ""re-education.""""Mao said we shouldn't learn from books; we should learn from the military, from the farmers, from the workers,"" she recalls in my online video. ""The poorer you were, the better you were. If you're illiterate, you're the best. ...""After I came to the United States I thought, oh, no more politics. I'm in the land of the free,"" she recounts.

People complain because Facebook is irresponsible about sharing our data. But to that I say, so what? I voluntarily give Facebook that information. I'd rather see targeted ads than random ones, and no one forces me to use Facebook.I worry more about what my government does. Facebook and Google cannot use force. Government can. Governments do.Already, there are new surveillance programs.Los Angeles police brag that they now practice ""predictive"" policing. They pay a company called Palantir to analyze social media, trace people's ties to gang members and predict the likelihood that someone may commit a crime.That makes some people feel safer.But ""I think they are giving government too much power,"" says Schoolland. ""They didn't realize this is going to lead to more and more.""I might like to know people's ""trust score"" before interacting with them, I tell her.""Yes, we want to know who we can trust when we do business,"" she responds, ""but those are market behaviors. We don't need the government to get involved.""For now, the internet, and other new technology, enhances my freedom.My son complains that it distracts us so much that we can't focus on what matters. That's true also, but I say, on balance, it's wonderful. It helps me band together with others who think like I do. It makes it easier for me criticize the government and business practices I consider unfair. Heck, that's what I do every week in my videos.But we should be on guard against use of technology to curtail our freedom. Government was dangerous enough — before it could spy on us so easily.

253,ADS,"The U.S. has begun an investigation into imports of automobiles and auto parts to determine whether those imports ""threaten to impair"" national security and the U.S. economy, the Commerce Department said late Wednesday, sending shares of automakers like Tata Motors (TTM), Toyota (TMC) and Honda (HMC) into retreat.XThe decision followed a ""conversation"" with President Trump, the Commerce Department said. And it could result in tariffs on automobiles brought in from abroad. The decision also represents the Trump administration's latest attempt to get tougher on international trade, which Trump has argued comes at the expense of U.S. workers' jobs.""There is evidence suggesting that, for decades, imports from abroad have eroded our domestic auto industry,"" Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said in a statement.""The Department of Commerce will conduct a thorough, fair, and transparent investigation into whether such imports are weakening our internal economy and may impair the national security,"" it continued.Trump, in the past, has also criticized U.S. automakers General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) for producing cars in Mexico.The move comes just a few days after China said it will cut import tariffs on certain vehicles to 15% from 25% effective July 1.""China opposes the abuse of national security clauses, which will seriously damage multilateral trade systems and disrupt normal international trade order,"" a Ministry of Commerce spokesman told reporters in Beijing on Thursday.Meanwhile, the Trump administration is trying to determine how, or whether, to hit back against overall imports from China.

""From 1990 to 2017, employment in motor vehicle production declined by 22%, even though Americans are continuing to purchase automobiles at record levels.""Ford was up 1.6% on Thursday, near its 200-day line.

In such a pattern, the stock has already broken out but then posts three quick corrections of around 10% to 20% over a nine- to 16-week period.

The ETF made a 52-week high Tuesday but reversed lower and continued to drop the rest of the week.

The bench mark 10-year Treasury note saw its yield fall 5 basis points to 2.95%. Yields fell after durable goods orders dropped more than expected in April, down 1.7%. It was the first decline since January and more than the 1.2% drop economists had forecast.Homebuilders, which have been facing higher mortgage costs as yields have risen for much of 2018, were another leading industry.

265,ADS,"Through May 31, the S&P 500 was up 1.3% year to date. Not a savory number for index investors. The Nasdaq composite rose 7.8%. And the IBD 50 gained 5.1%.While the list of premier growth companies has outperformed the large-cap benchmark by nearly fourfold, have some of the individual names done even better? You bet.Use the IBD 50 as a timesaving screen for picking great stocks at the right time. You know that making the IBD 50 means a company has top-notch fundamentals and wonderful relative strength. But the IBD 50 remains a watch list, not a buy list.What does this mean? Let the chart analysis at the bottom of every mini chart in IBD Weekly be your compass. If a stock is breaking out and in the permissible buy range, the analysis will say so. If not, then stay alert for follow-on buy points.Such additional entry points may include first and second rebounds off the 10-week moving average. Or a stock may thrust out of a three-weeks-tight pattern.Let's consider Viper Energy Partners (VNOM), Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), SVB Financial (SIVB), Trade Desk (TTD) and TAL Education (TAL). All five made the IBD 50 during the week of Feb. 26. February was a pivotal month in 2018 so far; the S&P 500 suffered its first 10%-plus correction since February of 2016. Yet these five companies flexed strength.They also help teach stock traders the importance of being nimble.Viper Energy finished the week ended Feb. 23 with a tiny gain, up 0.3%. That trailed a 0.5% rebound by the S&P 500. Then the U.S. oil and gas play fell for three weeks in a row.On the surface that sounds bad, right?Well, not necessarily. This is where careful analysis of Viper's weekly chart comes into play. While the stock did fall three weeks in a row, it limited the overall decline to 3.2% — skimpy and stingy losses.Check out the week ended March 16. Viper bounded off its lows of the week and cut the loss to just 0.4%. It was a tight weekly close. Tight weekly closes within a base matter. Viper had a lot of them. Treat them as a subtle clue that institutional investors are not that willing to dump shares.The Midland, Texas-based firm uncoiled out of its base with a breakout past 26.29 on April 5. Volume wasn't hissing quietly; 1.3 million shares exchanged hands, 219% above the 50-day average. Big price move, big volume on the breakout? Good results usually follow.Viper is now trading near 32, up 22% past the proper entry.Intuitive Surgical, noted as a ""stock of the day"" in IBD's social media coverage, hit a new high of 452 on Jan. 25, then began falling a few days before the major indexes did. Shares basically floated within a relatively tight trading range of 400 to 450.But on April 18, the stock's character changed. After reporting strong Q1 results (earnings up 43%, revenue up 25%, the biggest top-line jump in more than four years), Intuitive jammed out of an 11-week base. Both 452.10 and 445.20 are valid entry points.The robotic surgery systems pioneer has not gained a lot since then. But at 459, the medical stock leader has stretched its advance from an early breakout at 242.49 in February 2017 to 89%.SVB Financial, TAL and Trade Desk have also cleared new bases in recent weeks and are spanking the S&P 500 with year-to-date returns of 33%, 43% and 87%.You can trade the IBD 50 efficiently with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) by Innovator Capital.

266,ADS,"Oil prices continued to drop Friday as top OPEC and non-OPEC producers reportedly discuss options for raising crude production later this year, amid fears that crude's rally has gone too far.XEnergy ministers from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Russia are meeting in St. Petersburg to consider ways to boost output for the first time since 2016, when they began cutting production by a 1.8 million barrel per day. The meeting comes ahead of the official OPEC meeting next month.Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told Bloomberg there would likely be a gradual increase in production in the second half of the year as worries from consumers about the price ""is a concern to us.""Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies only want to raise output by 300,000 barrels per day, but Russia favors raising production by 800,000 bpd, sources told Bloomberg.

While Venezuela's economic crisis is crippling its oil industry, it actually saw an increase in production last month.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and Russia both want to raise output as supply worries from economic unrest in Venezuela and the renewed sanctions on Iran have raised prices to the point of hurting demand.Earlier this month the International Energy Agency warned in its monthly oil market report that it expects the ""recent jump in oil prices will take its toll,"" on demand and lowered its outlook for global demand growth.But Saudi Arabia won't want oil prices to fall to far as it looks get a good price for the initial public offering for state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco. Al-Falih said the IPO would ""most likely"" happen in next year.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Energy Stocks And Industry NewsLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

267,ADS,"The long-awaited Saudi Aramco initial public offering will ""most likely"" happen next year, but it depends on the oil market, said Saudi Arabia's energy minster as he dropped hints that sank the oil market Friday.XThe state-run oil company, which is the world's largest oil producer and one of its biggest companies by revenue, was supposed to list a 5% stake on an exchange this year and generate capital for the country's economic reforms.Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has estimated Aramco's valuation at $2 trillion, meaning the IPO could yield proceeds of $100 billion and dwarf Alibaba's (BABA) $25 billion haul as the biggest-ever IPO.But some analysts say the figure is closer to $1 trillion. But even then, that would be bigger than Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN), as they close in on the $1 trillion mark, and nearly three times the valuation of oil giant Exxon Mobil (XOM).Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseRecent reports had cast doubt on Aramco's initial 2018 timeline. In March, sources told the Financial Times that it would likely to be pushed back to next year or possibly later. Later that month, sources told the Wall Street Journal that Aramco would hold off on an international IPO and instead list on a domestic exchange next year.Then on Friday, Saudi Energy Minister and Aramco Chairman Khalid al-Falih told reporters ""most likely it will be in 2019, but we will not know until the announcement has been made. All I could say is stay tuned.""In March, he downplayed the importance of the IPO's timing, saying ""between December 31 (2018) and January 1 (2019) there is no value lost for the kingdom.""Several reasons have come up for the delay. Previously, it was due to low oil prices, which would've weighed on proceeds from Aramco's offering. But until prices fell this week, they were at the highest levels since 2014.Other factors include Riyadh's desire to seek a higher valuation for Aramco before going public as well as deciding where to list shares. The kingdom had wanted a listing on major exchanges in New York or London but has balked at the disclosures that would've been required.On Friday, Falih attributed a delay to the market, in which he plays a key role as the de facto leader of OPEC.""The timing I think will depend on the readiness of the market, rather than the readiness of the company or the readiness of Saudi Arabia,"" he said.Falih wielded his market influence, telling reporters that oil production may rise later this year as Saudi Arabia and Russia debate how much to boost crude output over worries that higher oil prices could stifle global demand.U.S. crude tumbled 4.5% to settle at $67.56 a barrel and lost 5.3% for the week. Brent fell 3.4%, to $76.12 per barrel and lost 3% for the week.Still, Saudi Arabia won't want oil prices to fall too far as it looks to get a good price for Aramco's IPO.""We are ready.

291,ADS,"The S&P 500 index, Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite all started last week higher but closed the week modestly lower. This sideways stock market action offered a chance for many leading stocks to work on handles in their consolidations. Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR) and Akamai Technologies (AKAM) finished handles last week, offering new buy points. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Alibaba (BABA) finished handles on Monday.All five stocks rallied at least 1% on Monday, with Twitter attempting a breakout. The stocks were mixed Tuesday morning.Handles offer a last shakeout of weak holders. When a stock clears a proper handle in strong volume, it's evidence that the stock is ready to advance.Proper handles involve at least five days of moderate declines, though some develop over several weeks. You want to see a gradual drift, ideally in light trade. Heavy trade would imply selling from big institutions. The midpoint of the handle should be above the midpoint of the base. If a handle forms in the lower half of a pattern, there may still be selling pressure as old investors seek to exit with a profit or minimal losses.While handles are most closely associated with cup bases, they also form on double-bottom patterns. Twitter and Akamai stocks are cup-with-handle bases, while the Facebook stock handle is on a double bottom. Alphabet and Alibaba stocks are trying to finish handles in double bottoms.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFacebook stock formed an oddly shaped, double-bottom base, with the second leg of the W falling sharply lower amid the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal. The stock cleared a 186.20 buy point on May 11, but volume was well below average. Indeed, shares had been rallying for a few weeks on weak trade.But after that tepid breakout, Facebook stock has pulled back modestly in even-lighter volume. As of Friday's close, Facebook stock has a handle with a new 188.42 buy point. Shares closed Friday at 182.68, then rose 1% to 184.49 on Monday.Facebook fell 0.4% to 183.80 in stock market trading today.Keep in mind that the relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been lagging since the start of November and hasn't made headway for the past 10 months.Twitter has formed a cup-with-handle base with a 33.88 entry. Much of the base formed below its 50-day moving average, though the handle is moderately above that level. Twitter stock price ended Friday at 32.63.Twitter climbed 3.1% to 33.63 Monday after rising as high as 34.03. The breakout attempt came on below average. Twitter fell 2.3% to 32.86 on Tuesday.Akamai Technologies formed a cup base since March 9, forging a handle last week. That gives the stock a 77.69 buy point. The stock climbed 1.5% to 76.46 Monday. Shares popped to 78.25 intraday Tuesday, briefly clearing the entry point, but reversed to close off 0.1% to 76.39.The Google parent rose 1.3% to 1,084.01 on Monday. As of Monday's close, Alphabet stock has a proper handle with a 1,118.25 entry point.However, the midpoint of the handle is just above the midpoint of the base. While that's proper, it also means a fair amount of overhead resistance could remain.Also, the stock's RS line has gone sideways for year, as Alphabet has moved in line with the S&P 500 index.Alphabet fell 0.8% to 1,075.31 on Tuesday.Alibaba has formed a shallow double-bottom base. On Monday, shares rose 1.35% to 197.64. The stock now has handle on a daily chart, creating a 200.10 entry.  Alibaba lost 0.9% to 195.87.But on a weekly chart, this potential handle isn't visible, because Alibaba rose fractionally last week and is up slightly so far this week. The handle buy point also isn't much lower than the 201.60 entry from just above the middle of the double-bottom's ""W.""At minimum, Alibaba's stock appears to be facing resistance at 200. The stock hasn't been above 200 since the mid-March peak of the middle part of the W.

For instance, if an investor refuses to heed the 8% sell rule, or averages down on a stock, or buys late-stage stories, pain is likely.Yet knowing the rules thoroughly can bring an awareness of exceptions. Consider Apple (AAPL), for example.In June 2012, IBD published a column with this headline, ""Acting Normal Isn't In Apple's Recent History."" The article pointed out that Apple broke out of several late stage bases in 2006 and 2007 and posted nice gains.What were the factors that let Apple succeed where most breakouts would fail?Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UsePart of the reason was Apple's fundamentals. Earnings jumped 60% to 32 cents a share in 2006. Don't a lot of stocks do the same? Yes, but this was only the second year that Apple had left the world of single-digit EPS increases. Growing earnings from a penny a share to six pennies a share — as Apple did in 2003-04 — isn't as impressive as big increases on top of sizable, year-ago earnings.In 2007, Apple grew earnings 75% to 56 cents share. Revenue grew 39% and 27% in the same two years.Institutional investors clearly saw a long-term, bullish picture for Apple. And that kind of conviction can allow a stock to win despite the base count.But enough about Apple. The Sector Leaders screen has four stocks that are either working on or recently broke out from a later-stage base. Do any of the stocks have what it takes to succeed from a later-stage base?Let's take a look at the four stocks.—China-based social-network provider Weibo (WB) is working on a fourth-stage base, according to MarketSmith's pattern-recognition technology. Earnings rose 156% in 2016 and 120% last year.Revenue rose 37% and 75% in the same years.One drawback for Weibo is that the stock doesn't have a lot of quality institutional support. Also, the stock gapped down Wednesday after reporting Q1 results.—Chip designer Nvidia (NVDA) is shaping a third-stage consolidation. The company grew earnings 138% in fiscal 2017 and 79% in fiscal 2018 ended in January.Revenue increased 38% and 41%.Nvidia has institutional support, but Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) trimmed its position 22% over the past two quarters and Primecap Odyssey Aggressive Growth Fund (POAGX) sold 34% of its position over the past two quarters. Both Contrafund and Primecap are A+ funds.—Internet entertainment site Netflix (NFLX) is working on a third-stage consolidation. Earnings stepped up 39% and 191% in the past two years.Revenue rose 30% and 32% in the same periods.Netflix has good institutional support. The A+ funds are either adding shares, standing pat or trimming lightly.—China-based online marketplace Alibaba (BABA) is working on a third-stage consolidation.Earnings grew 31% and 46% in the past two fiscal years. The fiscal year ends in March. Revenue increased 47% and 62%.Alibaba has good institutional support with one dent. Over the past two quarters, Fidelity Contrafund unloaded 56% of its stake.Do any of these stocks look like another Apple?Netflix looks like the most likely, by virtue of its institutional support.

The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review previously estimated drugs in the same class could go for $8,500 per year.Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond suggested Amgen was trying to avoid a battle with insurers over reimbursement by purposefully setting the price below expectations. Amgen learned that lesson with cholesterol drug, Repatha, he said in a report to clients.""Compared to the PCSK9 payer experience (Repatha), we think this may prove to be a shrewd move by Amgen and Novartis,"" he said. ""We think this will be seen as a reasonable price, which will likely preempt access and reimbursement hurdles.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn the stock market today, Amgen stock rose 0.9% to close at 176.30. Shares are consolidating with a buy point at 192.72. Shares of rival Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) popped 4.5% to close at 15.20. Eli Lilly (LLY) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA), which are working on similar drugs, each lifted a fraction.Aimovig and competing drugs from Alder, Lilly and Teva belong to the CGRP class, short for calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor. These drugs work by blocking the receptor to cut down on the number of migraines a patient suffers in a month.Amgen and Novartis are first to gain approval for a CGRP drug. Late Thursday, the Food and Drug Administration approved Aimovig to prevent migraines, both chronic and episodic. Teva, Alder and Lilly will likely follow with their own iterations over the next two years.The label is broad and clean, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note. It doesn't list any cautionary or warning language. Further, ""we believe that Amgen has avoided the pitfalls of excessive pricing in this kind of high-volume indication,"" he said.Amgen estimates there are 10 million patients in the U.S. who could benefit from drugs to prevent migraines. This is the first new class of migraine drugs in nearly three decades, Porges said. Before that, Botox gained approval to prevent migraines in chronic sufferers.Now, Amgen is preparing to jump on its first-mover advantage. It already has a number of patients ready to receive the drug within the next week. Porges ultimately expects Amgen to keep 35%-40% of the market in the long-term as other CGRP drugs come online.Lilly's drug, galcanezumab, will likely gain approval in 2018 with Teva and Alder following over the next two years, Porges said. European officials are now reviewing Aimovig.Aimovig's approval is a de-risking event for Alder, RBC analyst Brian Abrahams said in a report. Alder has been under pressure this year after its chief executive unexpectedly quit in March. The firm previously guided to a launch in 2019.""We believe the price point set by Amgen should enable good patient access and adoption for the class from the start,"" he said. This is ""favorable for Alder's ultimate later entry into this large market with a differentiated product.""Meanwhile, Teva is expected to be delayed until the end of this year over issues at a plant where the active ingredient is made. Analysts expect its drug, fremanezumab, to launch in mid-2019.Abrahams models the overall market for CGRP drugs that prevent migraines to be $10 billion to $20 billion. Long term, Leerink's Porges forecasts Aimovig grabbing $1.7 billion in U.S. sales in 2025, below consensus views for $1.8 billion.RELATED:How To Build Long-Term Profits In Stocks?

The deal, which is Walmart's largest-ever acquisition, requires regulatory approval in India.""India is one of the most attractive retail markets in the world, given its size and growth rate, and our investment is an opportunity to partner with the company that is leading transformation of e-commerce in the market,"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in a press release.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseDow Jones component Walmart fell 3.1% on the stock market today, hitting a seven-month low. Amazon was up 1%.In a research note, J.P. Morgan analyst Christopher Horvers said Walmart believed the deal offered a ""unique, moment-in-time opportunity"" to get in early in a potentially huge market. However he believes the capital may have been better allocated at home, especially as Uber will halt Walmart grocery deliveries next month.""With the Uber test reported to have ended, and AMZN in relentless pursuit, TGT already buying Shipt for $550MM in December, and COST and others partnering with Instacart, we'd prefer large capital deployments in fighting the last mile battle here,"" Horvers said.Baird Equity Research senior analyst lowered his price target on Walmart stock by $10 following the move.""Given pending EPS dilution, we are lowering our price target to $95 (from $105), or ~20x prospective FY19E EPS in the $4.60-$4.80 range,"" he said in a research note. ""That said, WMT's improving omni-channel relevance adds durability to the company's longer-term growth opportunity.""He also said the deal is CEO McMillon's ""boldest move yet as he continues to transform the company to compete/succeed in the future of retail.""Walmart and Flipkart will maintain distinct brands and operating structures. According to Euromonitor, online sales in the world's second most-populous nation are growing about 35% per year. Morgan Stanley sees India's e-commerce market growing to $200 billion in around a decade.Walmart's investment includes $2 billion of new equity funding. The aim is to aid Flipkart in accelerating future growth.Walmart expects a negative impact to fiscal 2019 EPS of around 25 to 30 cents, including an incremental interest expense related to the investment.For fiscal 2020 the company anticipates an EPS headwind in total of around 60 cents per share. This is comprised of an operating losses of approximately 40-45 cents per share. It also expects an interest expense of approximately 15 cents per share.The retail giant has not given a specific timetable on profitability.Walmart and Amazon had both reportedly bid for a controlling stake in India's leading e-commerce company, at a valuation of about $20 billion.Flipkart, founded in 2007, is India's most valuable startup. But it's not profitable. India is rapidly growing but it still has a relatively small middle class. Poor infrastructure complicates home delivery.Former Amazon employees founded Flipkart, and SoftBank reportedly had favored a sale to Amazon. But Flipkart's board reportedly believes Walmart could close a deal more quickly and smoothly. An Amazon-Flipkart pact would have faced regulatory hurdles, because Amazon is already India's No. 2 online retailer. Another point in discount giant Walmart's favor is its apparent willingness to let Flipkart founders Sachin and Binny Bansal continue to help lead the business.Amazon has committed $5.5 billion to India. Founder Jeff Bezos is keen to become the leader in the market of 1.3 billion people. The giant has already lost the Chinese market to Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD).Amazon and Walmart are in a knockdown, drag-out clash, trading punches in an escalating retail war with the lines blurring between online and offline.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Heading For The Checkout?

299,ADS,"The Russell 2000 showed on Thursday that stocks today remain in a confirmed uptrend, at one point rising more than 0.6%. But the general market stumbled lower in afternoon trading on news reports that President Trump expressed doubt that the U.S. will make concrete progress in ongoing trade talks with China.Even as the major indexes deflated, market breadth remained positive. On the Nasdaq, winners beat losers by a 4-3 margin. On the NYSE, winners led by roughly 100 issues. And, at the Russell 2000's session high of 1627, the popular gauge of small-cap stocks is up almost 6% through nearly five months of trading in 2018.China's Baozun (BZUN), a small-cap e-commerce expert, cleared a 52.43 buy point in a new base. Shares reached as high as 53.90, up 19.5%, before pulling back some.Baozun has already seen 11 million shares exchange hands, more than double its float of 19 million. The stock trades on average 2.6 million shares a day.Baozun ranks No. 8 in IBD's current Global Leaders Stock List.At 2:30 p.m., the Russell 2000 advanced 0.4%. The Nasdaq composite and the Dow Jones industrial average slumped around 0.3%. The S&P 500 edged down 0.2%. (For more updates on stocks today, please check IBD's Stock Market Today section, found beneath ""Market Trend"" on the homepage of Investors.com.)Volume is mixed, running lower vs. the same time Wednesday on the Nasdaq but higher on the NYSE.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, shows that the FAANG stocks shouldn't be ignored either.The iPhone, iPad and digital services titan is not participating in the market's upside, but the nearly 0.6% decline in superdull volume (apologies for the stock-market-style oxymoron) is actually a good thing for Apple investors. Why? The stock is making a quiet pullback after thrusting nicely past a new buy point: 179.04, 10 cents above the 178.94 middle peak within a double-bottom base.The double bottom is one of seven critical chart patterns that every savvy growth stock investor can use to build positions at the precise moment that a true market leader breaks past historical price-resistance levels and ramps to a series of new highs.On Jan. 6, 2017, Apple initially broke out of a first-stage cup with handle that furnished a 118.12 correct buy point. IBD's Stock Market Today feature covered that breakout in real time as well as the setup of that key juncture in the stock's current turnaround story.Baozun, featured frequently in Investors.com and IBD Weekly over the past few years, helps multinational companies gain inroads into the Chinese consumer market. You can read more about what Baozun does in a June New America article.The stock has 19 million shares in the float and 55 million shares outstanding. The market value is just under $3 billion. Early on Thursday, Baozun posted a 29% increase in earnings to 9 cents a share. The first quarter appears to be one of Baozun's seasonally slowest periods. But that 29% EPS gain also comes on top of a 75% jump to 7 cents in the year-ago quarter.First-quarter revenue rose 25% to $146.4 million, the highest for any first quarter in the company's history. That result is almost the same as Baozun's full-year revenue in 2012.Keep in mind that the stock swings much more wildly than any S&P 500 firm. Thursday's breakout past a 52.43 buy point is from a late-stage pattern. This does not mean the breakout won't work. But the risk of a negative reversal and a breakout failure is higher.Baozun initially broke out of a long, deep, first-stage cup base near 10 in late August of 2016.Elsewhere in stocks today, Cisco Systems (CSCO) gapped down at the open and slid more than 3% to 43.56. The Nasdaq tech giant undercut its 50-day moving average and is now nearly 6% below a 46.26 buy point in a cup without handle.That decline is not enough to execute the golden rule of investing.Watch to see if the data networking pioneer can hold up close to and eventually retake the 50-day line. As reported by IBD earlier today, Cisco has announced a huge new stock-buyback plan.For those who bought at the 46.26 entry, investors would have to cut losses at 8%, or when Cisco hits 42.56.Lithium miner Sociedad Quimica y Minera (SQM) dropped more than 4% to 55.24 in volume running nearly triple normal levels. Yet the sell-off does not wreck the current work on a new base being formed by the Chilean company.On April 5, Sociedad Quimica gapped up bullishly in price, leading to an eventual retaking of the 50-day moving average. That's a good sign. It means institutional investors are getting greedy again, showing renewed demand for shares.The Street sees SQM's earnings rising 10% to $1.80 a share this year and 17% in 2019. Over the past six quarters, earnings have lifted 320%, 82%, 77%, 19%, 105% and 35% vs. year-ago levels.That impressive record meets the C factor in CAN SLIM, IBD's seven-point paradigm for growth investing.

305,ADS,"Annie Turnbo Malone became a millionaire early in the 20th century, when a million bucks still meant something.And she did it the hard way: as a black woman without formal education. Against all odds, she combined an innate skill in caring for hair with an unquenchable desire to succeed to create a national beauty care product company. In the process, she gave jobs to thousands of African-American women who sold her products door to door like early-day Avon Ladies and even started a college for women that taught skills for success.Her unlikely journey began in Metropolis, Ill. Annie Turnbo (1869-1957) was the 10th of 11 children born to former slaves. Her parents died when she was still a toddler, so Turnbo was sent to live with an older sister in Peoria.Shomari Wills, author of ""Black Fortunes: The Story of the First Six African Americans who Escaped Slavery and Became Millionaires,"" noted: ""She was very smart. She looked around and saw her options were (limited): become a sharecropper or a domestic servant, and she certainly didn't want what she saw as a very hard life without money. But she knew she had a skill.""From a very young age, Turnbo had a penchant for working on women's hair, braiding and combing often difficult-to-manage locks. Her sisters and their friends happily let Annie work on their tresses, but also warned her not to vest too much in her foolish notions of starting her own hair care business, as necessary as it might have been.As Wills wrote, ""There was no defined black aesthetic"" for hair care in the years following the Emancipation Proclamation."" Women often braided their hair in an African style or covered their heads with scarves or bonnets. Some used harmful lye or bear grease in a misguided attempt ""to look more like white people.""Added Adia Harvey Wingfield, professor of sociology at Washington University in St. Louis and author of ""Doing Business with Beauty: Black Women, Hair Salons, and the Racial Enclave Economy"": ""Around this time, black women often considered their hair unattractive and unmanageable. Particularly in the post-slavery era, women had to work outside the home and they tried to improve their appearance to more conform to white society and be more acceptable to white employees. They'd receive ads for hair straightening products from white-owned companies that damaged their hair.""Though not in school, Turnbo continued to read about the latest advances in chemistry, which had been her favorite subject. One day, she read an article about an ointment that dairy farmers used to treat the skin of cows' udders. She purchased some from a local drugstore, mixed in natural ingredients from an herbalist to add a fresh, attractive aroma and created a formula that regrew hair in bald patches left by snake oil concoctions women had used in the past.She went door to door and stopped by as black churches let out Sunday mornings. Success didn't come immediately. The locals were skeptical. But slowly word spread that this product — she continued modifying and improving it — worked. She called it, appropriately, Wonderful Hair Grower. It eventually outgrew the small-town market.She moved to St. Louis, anticipating large crowds for the 1903 World Fair. By this time, she'd already expanded her line of hair care and beauty products for black women, including face powders, cleansing cream and shampoos.As she'd done back in Illinois, she hired and trained women to sell her products. She had to. Because she was black, normal distribution and sales channels were closed to her. But here the World's Fair proved a major boon to her business. It attracted African-Americans from around the country and the Caribbean. They were tourists who were not only potential customers, but also potential salespeople.She visited the fair as often as she could, pitching the idea every chance she had. In relatively short order, she built a national sales network.Around 1906, she named the company Poro. There is some question about how she came up with that. One theory is that it likely was named after a West African secret male society dedicated to discipline and enhancing the body physically and spiritually. Another was that she selected it just because it sounded African. In either case, it became clear that she wanted to connect her sales agents with their African roots.For Malone, it wasn't just about money. She believed if African-American women improved their appearance, it would enhance their self-respect and improve their ability to achieve success in all aspects of their lives.""The thing that struck me most about her is not only that she worked for her own success, but that it was important for her to help other African-American women succeed on their own,"" noted George T. Haley, professor of marketing and quantitative analysis at the University of New Haven's College of Business.""She wanted them to be independent, earn a decent wage and have a decent life. She recognized a salesperson's appearance (and the way she spoke) was a key to her success. It was something she learned on her own, and she made it part of the training for her sales force.""She was right. It was during this period that Jim Crow replaced Reconstruction laws. Black shoppers were excluded from white-owned stores and white institutions. The result was the creation of a sizable black economy stimulated by black-owned businesses.Turnbo not only rode this wave — at its height the company's sales amounted to almost $37 million in today's dollars and employed 75,000 women around the world — but she fueled it as well.  (One benefactor was Madam C.J. Walker, who worked for Turnbo and borrowed her formulas to found her own beauty company.)Turnbo, who married Eugene Malone (a former teacher and religious book salesman), extended the brand by franchising beauty salons around the country. She assured a continued supply of qualified beauticians and salespeople by starting Poro College in 1918. Given her interest in promoting a better life for black women, the school's curriculum went far beyond hairstyling and sales techniques. It included also courses on etiquette: how to walk, talk and dress — all this to prepare women for the workplace.Turnbo was the first black female millionaire and a strong believer in giving back. An important philanthropist, she donated substantial sums to Howard University School of Medicine and the St. Louis Colored Orphans Home (now the Annie Malone Children and Family Service Center), among other charities.Used her natural gifts and unbridled determination to build a multimillion-dollar beauty care empire.Overcame: Deep-seated prejudice and a Jim Crow society.Lesson: If you have a good product and a dedicated sales force, you can overcome a lot.Quote: ""Would you like a job selling the Wonderful Hair Grower?"" she asked satisfied customers again and again.

308,ADS,"Top hedge fund managers have bet against Warren Buffett and taken large positions in UnitedHealth (UNH), Anthem (ANTM) and other health insurers.XMeanwhile Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) has more than doubled its stake in generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA). It also confirmed it has become the second-largest shareholder in Apple (AAPL).In an SEC filing detailing its U.S.-listed stock holdings as of March 31, the company said it owned about 40.5 million Teva American depositary receipts worth about $693 million. This is up from 18.9 million ADRs worth $358 million the previous quarter.Health insurers shares slumped after Buffett, Amazon (AMZN) chief Jeff Bezos, and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon announced January a joint venture whose aim is to cut U.S. health care costs.""We want our employees to get better medical services at lower cost,"" Buffett said at Berkshire's annual shareholder's meeting earlier this month. ""The resistance will be unbelievable, and if we fail, at least we tried.""However rivals are betting against the plan, with power player Jana Partners revealing Tuesday new positions in Anthem and Cigna (CI), while Omega Advisors and billionaire investor Julian Robertson's Tiger Management have taken new positions in UnitedHealth, according to their regulatory filings.Teva had been under pressure since Mylan's (MYL) generic version of its multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone was approved in October and amid challenges facing the U.S. generic medicines industry.To contend, Teva announced a restructuring plan to trim $3 billion in spending by closing plants and cutting drug programs. In February, Teva said it was well on its way to realizing half those savings by year's end.One Buffett decision that hedge fund managers seem to agree with is his increased Apple holding. Barry Rosenstein's Jana Partners has a new position in the tech giant, though it has sold all its shares in Facebook (FB). Highlighting the rough recent performance of homebuilders, Jana also revealed it had cut its stake in D.R. Horton by 96% to 47,000 shares. Other new positions include Adobe Systems (ADBE), ADT (ADT), Boston Scientific (BSX) and Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS).In contrast, Tiger Management upped its positions in Facebook, while also taking more stock in Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL).David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital added InterActiveCorp (IAC) and exited Chemours (CC)Activist investor Carl Icahn sold off his stake of American International Group (AIG) and increased his position in Herbalife Nutrition (HLF). Hedge fund superstar Bill Ackman famously lost his $1 billion bet against Herbalife back in March, which he took out after claiming the company was a pyramid scheme.Third Point raised its stake in Facebook by 18%, took 1.5 million shares in Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and 550,000 shares in Microsoft (MSFT).YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:CVS: 'We're Going To Deliver' What Amazon, JPMorgan, Berkshire Seek To DoAmazon, Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan Chase Team On Health Care; CVS, UnitedHealth DiveCould Facebook, Esports, Media Boom From Legalized Sports Betting?

309,ADS,"Amgen (AMGN) stock took double hits Tuesday as Dow Jones component Pfizer (PFE) grabbed approval for a knockoff of Amgen's anemia treatment and Eli Lilly (LLY) reported strong results for a competing headache drug.On the stock market today, Amgen stock toppled 2.1% to close at 172.34. Pfizer dipped 0.5% to finish at 35.69. Lilly slipped 1% to 82.21.Shares of all three stocks are consolidating with respective buy points at 192.72, 39.53 and 89.19. And shares of biotech companies and pharmaceutical companies each fell a fraction.The Food and Drug Administration approved Pfizer's drug called Retacrit midday Tuesday. Retacrit is a biosimilar — and almost identical biologic copy — of Amgen's drug Epogen/Procrit. Epogen/Procrit is an anemia treatment.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UsePfizer's approval isn't a major hit for Amgen's revenue, which saw just $244 million in first-quarter sales of Epogen. Epogen was Amgen's seventh biggest drug in the first quarter, but sales declined 10% vs. the year-earlier period.But others are attempting to copy Amgen's biggest drugs, Neulasta and Enbrel. Neulasta increases bone marrow stimulation. Enbrel treats five chronic diseases including some forms of arthritis and psoriasis. Both are blockbusters.Novartis (NVS) has an Enbrel biosimilar called Erelzi. The drug is approved, but Novartis' unit Sandoz can't launch Erelzi until its patent dispute with Amgen is complete. Novartis' Sandoz, Mylan (MYL) and Coherus Biosciences (CHRS) also are working on biosimilars of Neulasta.Amgen is also rivaling Lilly, Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) with a migraine drug in a class called anti-CGRPs, short for calcitonin gene-related peptide. All four firms are working on treatments that would prevent chronic migraines.On Tuesday, Lilly said its medicine, called galcanezumab, met its key goal in a late-stage study of patients with episodic cluster headaches. It reduced weekly cluster headaches compared with a placebo across weeks one to three of a two-month treatment period.A statistically significantly greater percentage of patients treated with Lilly's medicine also saw at least a 50% reduction in weekly attacks compared to placebo at week three. The drug proved safe and tolerable. Lilly's drug is also being studied in migraines.Amgen and Novartis partnered to develop Aimovig. It's likely to be the first in its class to get approval to prevent chronic migraines. The Food and Drug Administration is expected to make a decision about Aimovig later this week.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Tame A Volatile Swing Trade With A Half PositionLooking For The Next Nvidia?

311,ADS,"Stock market futures rose modestly early Friday, with Dow Jones futures, S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures all higher.Applied Materials (AMAT) was a big loser on disappointing sales guidance late Thursday. Fellow chip-equipment makers such as Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) also retreated. So did memory chip giant Micron Technology (MU).Meanwhile, China search engine giant Baidu (BIDU) fell sharply after announcing a key executive shakeup involving its artificial intelligence efforts.As for stock market futures today, Dow Jones futures rose 0.25% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.1%. Nasdaq 100 futures advanced nearly 0.2%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn Thursday's stock market trading, the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite closed with slim losses. Small caps continued to lead, with the S&P 600 rising for the ninth time in 10 sessions.Baidu says that COO Lu Qi will leave the role and no longer oversee the search engine giant's artificial intelligence efforts. Qi had joined the company in late 2016 to head up AI efforts. Baidu has made huge spending bets on AI to drive future growth.The stock fell 6.2% to 262.50 in premarket trading. That would push Baidu back below a conventional entry of 275.07 from a long consolidation.Applied Materials earnings rose 54% to $1.22 a share in its fiscal Q2, with revenue rising 29% to $4.57 billion. Both comfortably beat analyst views. But the chip-equipment maker sees Q3 revenue of $4.43 billion. That's roughly in line with the Zacks estimate of $4.45 billion, but clearly below other consensus targets for $4.53 billion.Applied Materials fell 5.1% in the premarket, suggesting a move below its 200-day moving average at Friday's open. On Thursday, the stock fell 2.2% to 53.96, once again hitting resistance at its 50-day moving average.The Applied Materials stock chart, which previously had been forming a double-bottom base, is starting to look like a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern.Meanwhile, Lam Research lost about 1.5% early Friday. KLA-Tencor was not yet active Friday but had fallen late Thursday by about 1.5%. Lam has been fighting to hold above its 50-day, while KLA-Tencor is just above that level.Applied Materials is heavily exposed to the memory market, with over half its sales going to the DRAM and flash markets. Memory giant Micron Technology lost 0.6% early Friday. Micron fell 3.2% to 54.70 on Thursday. The IBD 50 chip stock has been building the right side of a consolidation, retaking its 50-day line on Monday.The broader chip sector has been so-so in recent months. Chipmakers and fabless chipmakers have done reasonably well, helped by Intel (INTC) and Nvidia (NVDA) moving into buy range. A few others are consolidating in decent form, but breakouts are scarce. But chip-equipment makers have struggled in recent months, with the Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment group falling to 133 out of the 197 industries tracked by IBD. The group's relative strength line has been lagging for nearly six months, reflecting its underperformance vs. the S&P 500 index.Typically, the broader stock market struggles to rally without chips. The major averages have largely done so in recent weeks in part due to the surge in oil stocks. But it's also due to Apple (AAPL), which is a huge buyer of chips. But Apple's big recent breakout reflects optimism about a $100 billion buyback, strong growth in services and Warren Buffett buying more shares. None of that benefits chipmakers. Indeed, iPhone shipments were slightly below estimates in the latest quarter.But with Apple now pausing after its 17% surge over nine sessions, watch to see if the relationship between chips and the broader market reasserts itself.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Small Caps Sail As Rest Of Market HesitatesBest Oil Stocks: Callon Petroleum Grows Like Gangbusters In Permian BasinThe Stock Market Myth That Too Many BelieveTop IPO Stock Triggers Sell Signal, But Rebounds; Is It Safe To Buy?Deere Reports, These 2 IBD 50 Stocks Form Bases: Investing Action Plan

314,ADS,"Allergan (AGN) crushed Botox sales expectations in the first quarter and raised its 2018 guidance, but shares toppled Monday on a report the drugmaker is ""very unlikely"" to make a transformative acquisition.The potential for Allergan to make a deal hit a fever pitch earlier this month when the firm briefly confirmed it was considering a bid on Shire (SHPG). Hours later — following its stock plunge — Allergan said it wouldn't rival Takeda Pharmaceuticals for Shire.Early Monday, in an interview with Reuters, Chief Executive Brent Saunders said Allergan is considering five options as part of a strategic review. Management could deploy capital to buy back shares, divest its operations, split the company, make acquisitions or operate Allergan as is.But doing deals is a ""very low priority and a very unlikely outcome,"" he reportedly said. A split would take the longest and be the most disruptive, he noted.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn the stock market today, Allergan shares tumbled 5.2% to close at 153.65, on the news. That followed an earlier pop up 2.7% after Allergan topped first-quarter estimates, crushed 2018 profit views and narrowly topped full-year revenue guidance expectations.For the first quarter, Allergan reported adjusted income of $3.74 per share, growing 11.6% to beat the consensus for $3.36. Sales of $3.67 billion grew 2.8% and topped the view of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $3.59 billion.In the U.S., Botox cosmetic sales of $196.7 million grew 7% year over year and topped the view of Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler for $172.4 million. Botox as a therapeutic brought in $358.5 million, up 16.1% and also beat Koffler's estimate for $330.4 million.Outside the U.S., Botox sales brought in $244.8 million, topping Koffler's model for $224.6 million. In total, Botox revenue advanced 14.5% to $817.3 million.But Juvederm, a collection of facial fillers, only grew 2.5% to $122.8 million in the U.S. This ""may reflect some destocking from the fourth quarter,"" Koffler said in a note. Globally, sales of the Juvederm collection grew 11.1% to $268.9 million.Restasis, Allergan's powerhouse eye-disease drug, generated $274.1 million in sales with 93% of that coming from the U.S. Year over year, though, sales of Restasis fell 15.1%. Allergan cited ""trade buying patterns and lower net selling prices"" for a 17.2% decline in the U.S. alone.Allergan also upped its 2018 guidance. For the year, the firm sees $15.15 billion to $15.35 billion in sales, with a midpoint of $15.25 billion that was slightly north of views for $15.22 billion. Previously, Allergan had modeled $15 billion to $15.3 billion in sales.Adjusted income is now expected to come in between $15.65-$16.25 per share, up from the firm's earlier estimate for $15.25-$16. The midpoint of Allergan's new guidance is $15.95 per share and crushed views for adjusted earnings of $15.63 per share.For the second quarter, Allergan expects to report adjusted profit of $4-$4.20 per share and $3.85 billion to $4 billion in sales. At the midpoints, both metrics easily topped the consensus for adjusted earnings of $3.92 per share on $3.847 billion in sales.RELATED:New Option Strategy Limits Risk Around EarningsShould You Buy A Stock Ahead Of Its Earnings Report?Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn Friday, Perrigo said the FDA will likely delay its generic ProAir, though the firm didn't say why. Previously, Perrigo had expected to launch its copycat in the fourth quarter of 2018. It had expected generic ProAir to be worth 9 cents in full-year earnings per share and had guided to $5.05-$5.45 a share in overall profits on its May 8 quarterly earnings conference call.Steadman noted the difficulties with developing an asthma product. GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) Advair also faces mounting competition. Teva launched a generic in 2017 and Mylan (MYL) is expected to launch one this year. But he sees the delay for generic ProAir as ""relatively minor.""""As evidenced with generic Advair development and now ProAir, it's been extremely difficult to develop generics for inhaled products and we're not certain of the timeline for a potential ProAir launch,"" he said.For Teva, Perrigo's delay means there are no other potential makers of generic ProAir in 2018, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said in a note. ProAir generated $350 million in U.S. sales in 2017.Still, Teva is facing a number of other issues as it attempts to restructure under new Chief Executive Kare Schultz. Its plan, unveiled in February, cuts the workforce by 14,000, closes several plants and terminates a slew of specialty programs in an effort to save $3 billion.""While a delay in generic competition would be a benefit to Teva's top line, this is obviously a rather minor positive relative to the other challenges the company is currently facing,"" Divan said. He sees ProAir adding $20 million to $40 million quarterly through mid-2019.Divan has an outperform rating and 23 price target on Teva.RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

329,ADS,"Akorn (AKRX) shares lost a third of their value Monday after Fresenius (FMS) walked away from a pending $4.3 billion merger deal for the U.S. maker of generic cancer drugs after a probe found problems with Akorn's product-development practices.Germany-based Fresenius said its outside experts found ""material breaches"" of U.S. Food and Drug Administration standards while reviewing Akorn's operations. Fresenius said it offered to delay its decision until Akorn had completed its own investigation, but was turned down. That sets up a potential legal battle with the U.S. company over the aborted takeover.Shares of Akorn, which is based in suburban Chicago, fell 33.8% to close at 13.05. Fresenius' U.S.-listed shares dropped 5.5% on the New York Stock Exchange to finish at 49.17.Investors became increasingly wary of the deal after Fresenius announced it a year ago.

Its former chairman, John Kapoor, left the company after being arrested on separate racketeering charges.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseUnder the terms of the deal announced in April 2017, Akorn had agreed to pay a $129 million termination fee if the agreement fell through, Fresenius said. Akorn said in a statement Sunday that the issues being investigated weren't a condition to closing. It said the issues wouldn't materially hurt the German company, therefore giving it no reason to drop the deal.""We categorically disagree with Fresenius' accusations,"" Akorn said after Fresenius issued its own statement saying it was walking away. ""We intend to vigorously enforce our rights, and Fresenius' obligations, under our binding merger agreement.""Fresenius disclosed its investigation, prompted by an anonymous tip, in February. Some analysts had viewed a price cut as more likely than a collapse of the deal.Fresenius will keep pursuing a stronger position in the U.S. generics market via organic growth, as well as through acquisitions, spokesman Matthias Link said on Sunday.Akorn's shares have traded well below Fresenius' offer price since the end of February. That's when the German company said violations of FDA rules could imperil the takeover. Akorn closed at $19.70 on Friday, about 42% below Fresenius' $34-a-share price.Through Friday, Fresenius shares had lost about 11% since the Akorn deal was announced on April 24 of last year, compared with a 4.5% increase in Germany's benchmark DAX Index.Akorn would have given Fresenius' Kabi drugs unit access to a network of retail pharmacies and outpatient clinics, a broader range of potential customers for its generic drugs for cancer.

Vertex thinks its can treat up to 90% of cystic fibrosis patients with its treatment. On Thursday, Vertex said it will send a second regimen into Phase 3 testing.But a third potential combination is being held up as Vertex does additional studies on one drug involved in the regiment, known under the test moniker of VX-561. In Phase 2 testing, a regimen of VX-561 and tezacaftor with either of two other test drugs, VX-659 or VX-445, improved patients' ability to forcefully expel air.However, ""given very little monotherapy or dose-ranging work has been done with VX-561, FDA requested additional clinical trial(s) prior to Phase 3 start,"" Needham analyst Alan Carr wrote in his report to clients. ""No guidance on timing, but a first quarter 2019 initiation seems feasible.""The once-daily regimen using VX-561 is a ""nice to have"" but far from a ""must have"" for the first three-drug regimens, RBC analyst Brian Abrahams said in a note. Two combinations in Phase 3 studies are also daily regimens, but require a single dose of Vertex's Kalydeco in the evening.Further, the delay for the VX-561 regimen doesn't mean other combinations won't pass muster with the FDA, analysts say. Vertex has a total of four potential combos in pivotal studies, Piper Jaffray analyst Edward Tenthoff said in his note. He sees Vertex as a year ahead of Galapagos.Leerink's Porges now expects Vertex's first three-drug regimens will be on the market in the first quarter of 2020. Previously, he'd predicted a late 2019 launch for these regimens.""This change is not particularly meaningful to our forecast, since Vertex's primary competitor, Galapagos, seems no closer to U.S. pivotal trials than they were six months ago,"" he said. Further, Galapagos may also be required to run additional studies before going into pivotal testing.Porges reduced his sales views for 2018 and 2019 by 4%-5%. He still sees rapid revenue growth to almost $5 billion in 2020 and $6.7 billion in 2022. He also cut his price target on Vertex to 175 from 190, though reiterated his outperform rating.""Vertex remains one of the most uncomplicated growth stories in large-cap biotech,"" he said.

341,ADS,"""Across Europe and North America, centrists are the least supportive of democracy, the least committed to its institutions and the most supportive of authoritarianism."" So wrote political researcher David Adler in The New York Times after analyzing responses to two multi-country surveys on values.Adler found that centrists are less likely to regard democracy as ""very good"" and to consider free elections and protecting liberties from state oppression ""essential"" features of democracy. His study is subject to criticism, notably that his classification of centrists is overbroad, but it contains at least a kernel of truth.The most vitriolic critics of electoral decisions in recent years around the world have been long identified — and celebrated — as centrists. They have been arguing that extremists, mostly on the right, are undermining the foundations of democracy. Democracy, in their view, is becoming dangerously undemocratic.That is the essence of much of the ""Resistance"" in this country to Donald Trump. His election was the result of a handful of Russian-sponsored Facebook ads. His complaints about the press are seen as a prelude to shutting it down. Hillary Clinton's election-season denunciation of those unwilling to accept an election result has given way to nonstop whining from someone who bridles at accepting an election result.Similarly, in Britain, Tony Blair has refused to accept the June 2016 Brexit referendum, in which more voters supported leaving the European Union than have ever voted for any party. Blair is looking to the House of Lords and the courts to force a revote.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn Colombia, voters in October 2016 rejected President Juan Manuel Santos' peace agreement with the FARC guerrillas. Centrists disapproved of the vote; four days later, Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. But voters have persisted, and in last Sunday's election, Santos' handpicked successor got only 25% of the vote.In Italy, the normally ceremonial role of president has just changed. The current president is about to force another election because he refused to approve the new euroskeptic government's nominee for finance secretary based on his threats to leave the eurozone.Blair, the Nobel committee and the Italian president — and the would-be Trump impeachers — evoke the oft-cited attitude of one American military officer in Vietnam: They believe they have to kill democracy to save it.Of course, they could argue — and sometimes do — that the policies advocated by the winners in the democratic process would be harmful and that they would undermine democracy. But that's a stretch, particularly coming from leaders whose centrist policies have proved to be far less successful than people used to think.Take Blair, whose decisions were seldom challenged in his 10 years as British prime minister. He surreptitiously changed policy to admit hundreds of thousands of low-skilled immigrants and led a government that refused to prosecute Muslim gangs that preyed on young working-class girls. If it hadn't been for the opposition of his colleague and rival Gordon Brown, who would become prime minister, Blair would have ditched the pound and put Britain on the euro.The euro was the work of political centrists — and was clearly an enormous policy blunder. The decision to admit a million mostly Muslim young men to Germany, made without consultation by the most praised current centrist politician, Chancellor Angela Merkel, was another obvious blunder.Another centrist policy, eased mortgage standards for minority homebuyers, got staunch support from both George W. Bush and Barack Obama — and was a major cause of the Great Recession.Given this record, it's not surprising that centrist leaders are increasingly the objects of voters' scorn. ""The chief accomplishment of the current educated elite,"" wrote centrist David Brooks in The New York Times this week, ""is that it has produced a bipartisan revolt against itself.""Meanwhile, the centrists' warnings against the authoritarianism of the extremes look like a case of projection — attributing your own shortcomings to others.It's slightly absurd for unelected and unaccountable European Union officials to criticize decisions of national electorates as undemocratic and to refuse to accept the results of national referendums and force revotes until the people get it right.As for freedom of speech, centrist governments in Britain, Sweden and Germany aggressively suppress reports of violence and crime by Muslim immigrants. Supposedly centrist colleges in the United States routinely suppress free speech, and their recent graduates hired by Silicon Valley firms — Google, Facebook, Twitter — are busy suppressing speech in the larger society.So if you're worried about extremists' authoritarianism, keep an eye on the centrists, too.

342,ADS,"The stock market doesn't care about your opinions. The stock market doesn't care about what was true yesterday, only what's true right now. As an investor, you need to set aside your preconceptions and be ready to adapt to changes in the market direction and individual stocks. Apple (AAPL), Alibaba (BABA), Facebook (FB), Boeing (BA) and Taser maker Axon Enterprise (AAXN) have all gone through good times and bad.Apple is now a leading stock, but just a few weeks ago it had been lagging the S&P 500 index for months. Alibaba and Facebook had long slumps soon after their IPOs before big runs. Boeing moved sideways for years before suddenly becoming the biggest Dow Jones gainer in 2017. (Alibaba, Facebook and Boeing are once again in a state of flux.) Much-smaller Axon Enterprise went through a years-long slump before doubling in the last few months.As for the the major stock market averages, the S&P 500 index rose for 14 out of 15 months before stock market volatility returned. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones struggled to move and hold above their 50-day moving averages since early February, but they did so last week.Bottom line, if you want to make a dime in the stock market, you have to be ready to change on a dime.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseGo back to April 27. Apple's stock had fallen through its 50-day and 200-day moving averages amid growing signs of flagging iPhone demand. The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, was falling. The RS line had peaked in early November and hadn't made progress over the past year — or the past five.At this point, investors had every reason to be wary of Apple.But then Apple went on a nine-day, 17% winning streak, which only ended Friday with a 0.8% dip. Early in that run, Apple reported better-than-expect profit and announced a $100 billion stock buyback. A few days later, Warren Buffett announced that Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) had bought another 75 million shares of Apple in the first quarter, bringing its total stake to nearly 5%. That sent Apple stock blasting through a double-bottom base and to a new high on May 4. Its RS line also set a record high.Apple stock edged higher in early stock market trading today.IPO shot up at the open of its May 2012 debut, but closed near session lows and just above its 38 IPO price. Facebook then slumped for months, hitting 18.03 in August. Remember, back then it was unclear if Facebook would successfully transition to mobile in terms of users and especially ad revenue. The stock looked like an overhyped IPO bust, much like Snapchat operator Snap (SNAP) has since its 2017 debut.Facebook didn't break out of a base until July 2013. It didn't set a new high until September 2013.Since then Facebook has been on a huge run, back by mammoth earnings and revenue growth.More recently, the RS line trended lower since November. Facebook crashed in late March over the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Shares have rebounded since then. But after retaking its 50-day and 200-day lines on April 26, the stock has risen in low volume.On Friday, Facebook stock rose 0.8% to 186.99. Technically, Facebook cleared an odd-shaped double-bottom base, but the weak volume and price gain raises concerns.Low-volume breakouts can work, but a strong gain in heavy trade would be encouraging.Facebook shares rose a fraction in the premarket.Alibaba came public at 68 in its September 2014 debut, but jumped to an intraday peak of 99.70. The fast-growing Chinese e-commerce giant pulled back for a few weeks, then rallied and cleared an IPO base with a 99.80 entry. The stock ran up to to 120 by November 2014. Great stock, right?But shares actually reversed sharply lower on that November 2014 record day. By year-end, Alibaba was below its 50-day line. The stock kept falling until September 2015, when it finally bottomed at 57.20, more than 50% below its all-time high and undercutting its IPO price. Terrible stock, right?The top Chinese stock then underwent a long consolidation. Shares finally broke out in August 2016. That worked for a while, but shares then nearly roundtripped the buy point. Shares set up and broke out again in February 2017, triggering months of outperformance vs. the S&P 500.More recently, Alibaba has moved sideways. Much like Apple, its RS line has been flattish for months, trending vaguely lower since November peak. But since April 25, the stock has trended upward, approaching a double-bottom entry. Unlike Apple, it has not broken out and its RS line is not at highs.Shares rose slightly Monday morning.Investors should keep an open eye and open mind about Alibaba.Boeing moved sideways from late 2013 to late 2016. Its RS line trended slightly lower. Dead money?As it turns out, the Dow Jones aerospace giant was finally ready for takeoff.Boeing shares broke in October 2016 in its heaviest daily and weekly volume in eight months, on better-than-expected earnings. The RS line was at consolidation highs. Boeing also broke out of flat bases in January 2017, again in the spring and once more in late summer. Boeing went on to be the top Dow Jones stock in 2017. Shares kept rallying and outperforming through February.The stock pulled back, falling below its 50-day two weeks later. Boeing has largely traded below that level since then, though it reclaimed that support last week. It's working on a new consolidation. Its RS line is off highs, but not radically so.Boeing edged up in the premarket.Axon Enterprise, formerly Taser, ran up from 2012 to June 2015. The stock then sold off until January 2016. It  rallied somewhat, but then moved sideways into early 2018.Once known for its Taser guns, the renamed company is focusing on body-worn cameras and data storage of that footage.Axon briefly cleared a long cup-with-handle in mid-February, pulled back to its 50-day, but entry still valid.Then Axon reported blowout earnings, sending the stock skyrocketing 28% on Feb. 28. Well above the buy zone, the breakway gap offered a buying opportunity. The stock has kept rising and hasn't formed a new entry point. Axon blasted 22% higher on Wednesday following her latest earnings, then rose into the end of the week.Axon stock was little changed early Monday.In less than 3 months, Axon stock has more than doubled.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Trump Tweets Lifts Stock Futures; Good News For These Techs?Time To Buy These 5 Hot Payment Stocks?Splunk Leads This Trio, All In Buy Ranges: Tests Chart-Reading SkillsBreakout Watch: No. 1-Ranked Software Stock Salesforce Enters Buy ZoneThese 4 Top Stocks Attempt Breakouts, But All Have FlawsThis Medical Stock And New Issue Is In Buy Range After Break

371,ADS,"Have you noticed how some top growth stocks seem to make the IBD 50 week in, week out? Or, after taking a brief vacation outside the list, some of these market leaders knock on the IBD 50's door, saying ""I'm home""?One reason for that: high-quality growth in quarterly sales and earnings. Consider Adobe Systems (ADBE). What is high quality? How about the digital imaging and marketing company growing earnings per share 48%, 39%, 45%, 42%, 44%, 47%, 40% and 65% in the past eight quarters?A second reason: strong price-and-volume action. Adobe's relative strength line, a gauge of performance vs. the S&P 500, climbs higher over the long term. That RS line doesn't show a big break in its upward trend, especially on a weekly chart.Want a third reason? High relative industry group strength. Adobe helps fulfill the L in IBD's CAN SLIM investment paradigm. The ""L"" stands for leader, not laggard.Stocks showing excellence across the broad industry sector or specific industry group tend to do much better than stocks that belong to an industry group that's merely bumbling along. No wonder, then, that the IBD 50 tends to have a tilt toward the strongest sectors over the past three to 12 months.So an experienced stock picker will not be surprised to find that the computer, finance, medical and consumer-oriented sectors occupy the biggest tracts of real estate within the IBD 50.As of Thursday, the computer and finance sectors held the highest number of slots in the IBD 50, with nine stocks each. The related bank sector had one member, SVB Financial (SIVB). Medical was third with seven.Grubhub (GRUB) shows how some special stocks in the current market uptrend seem to straddle two or more sectors at the same time.You don't call Chicago-based Grubhub on the phone and ask them to order pizza or sushi on your behalf. Grubhub is an internet and mobile-based platform. It brings restaurants ever closer to customers. This business model is not exactly new, but the managers are executing growth with the precision of an all-star slugger.Trade Desk (TTD) hails from the business services sector. As of Thursday, it ranked No. 4 among the 33 sectors that make up IBD's stock research tables. The sector has advanced 11% since Jan. 1. Trade Desk is up 82% year to date. Why? Here again, fundamentals matter.The Ventura, Calif.-based company has created a self-service platform in which ad buyers and agencies can efficiently select when and where to place their ads. The goal: maximize return on investment. Judging by Trade Desk's sales, its ""omnichannel"" and ""programmatic"" features are attracting more advertising dollars and bigger corporate customers.Trade Desk's sales grew 61% in the first quarter to $85.7 million. In Q4 last year, the top line bulged 42% and hit the $100 million mark for the first time. Sales rose on average 63% vs. year-ago levels in the prior four quarters.That kind of sales growth tends to lead to fantastic bottom-line growth. Trade Desk, which in some respects can be seen as an internet sector play, is no exception.

Dow components Boeing (BA) and 3M (MMM) were the only two out of 30 names to rise 1 point or more.Ninety minutes into Thursday's session, the blue chip index slid as much as 1.6% before slowly climbing higher the rest of the way.The Dow industrials poked below its long-term 200-day moving average for the second time since April 2. That's evidence of a new shakeout taking place.At 23,930, the Dow industrials still stands nearly 10% off its peak, despite the fact that IBD's current outlook for the market holds at ""Uptrend under pressure.""The S&P 500 also slid below the long-term 200-day moving average but turned a loss of more than 1.4% to just a 0.2% dip, another bullish sign. Still, watch to see if the large-cap benchmark tries in future trading sessions to mark another close below the 200-day line.The Nasdaq composite was off less than 0.2% after having fallen as much as 1.5%. The premier index of growth companies continues to test buying support near the 7000 level.Volume ran sharply higher on the Nasdaq vs. the same time Wednesday and slipped lower on the NYSE, according to early data.The Russell 2000 and the Dow transports both fell 0.5%. The Russell 1000, a popular small-cap gauge, is clinging to a tiny year-to-date gain.Marathon Oil rallied more than 6% at one point and got as high as 19.51 before cooling off some. The stock easily surpassed an 18.76 buy point in a 13-week cup with handle. The 5% buy zone extends up to 19.70.Marathon is an integrated oil and gas firm. The large-cap firm from Houston posted earnings of 18 cents a share in Q1, reversing a 13-cent net loss in the year-ago quarter. Sales boomed 62% to $1.73 billion.Marathon is not the only company with strong relative performance and good IBD ratings, as seen in IBD's stock quotes and in the Stock Checkup tool. Ecopetrol (EC), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Italy's Eni Spa (E) all hold a Relative Price Strength Rating of 80 or higher.While oil and gas explorers slumped, integrated firms such as Marathon Oil advanced smartly as the rally in crude oil futures show no signs of abating. U.S. WTI near-term futures bounced from a nearly 0.7% loss to finish up and well above $68 a barrel.WTI crude is now up more than 13% year to date. In contrast, the S&P 500, at 2627, is down nearly 1.7% since Jan. 1. The 500 ran up 19.4% in 2017.Tableau, meanwhile, gapped out of a base-on-base pattern at 87.70, rising more than 7% to 91.30 in quadruple normal volume.Tableau is a Big Data analytics software expert. The Seattle-based firm notched its fourth quarter in a row of solid earnings per share. Revenue climbed 23% to $246.2 million, the biggest jump in five quarters.According to IBD Stock Checkup, Tableau's so-so 68 Composite Rating belies a strong 89 RS Rating, meaning the company is outperforming 89% of all publicly traded firms in IBD's database over the past 12 months. Given Thursday's strong advance, watch to see if Tableau's ratings edge higher.Going back to Apple, the iPhone, iPad and digital services titan acted stingy in giving back Wednesday's strong gain, a good sign for the bulls. The stock initially fell more than 1% to 174.63 in brisk trade. Then it wiped out those modest losses to end 0.2% higher to 176.89.The megacap tech is possibly forming the right side of a shallow seven-week double-bottom base. The middle peak between the base's  two lows is 178.94. Hence, a new buy point would be 179.04, 10 cents above that middle peak. The decline within the base is very light at 12.5%.Apple is still trading near all-time highs, another bullish sign. At $897 billion, it's the largest company by market value on the U.S. financial markets. In IBD Stock Checkup, the Cupertino, Calif., firm shows decent ratings such as an 85 for EPS (Earnings Per Share) and 86 for Relative Price Strength.Earlier this week the iPhone giant reported a 30% jump in fiscal second-quarter earnings to $2.73 a share, the biggest jump in 10 quarters, as revenue grew 16%, marking a sixth quarter in a row of top-line acceleration.Apple's revenue slumped 9% during the fiscal fourth quarter of FY 2016, then rose 3%, 5%, 7%, 12% and 13% in the next five quarters.The Street expects Apple's earnings turnaround to keep shining brightly. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expect profit to climb 30% in the June-ending fiscal third quarter to $2.17 a share.Despite the nifty reversal by the major indexes, investors also seem to show nervousness on the outcome of two-day trade talks between top U.S. and Chinese economic officials in Beijing.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and other key players arrived in the Middle Kingdom on Thursday for talks later in the day and Friday.Bloomberg reported a senior Chinese government official as saying that China will refuse any U.S. preconditions for negotiations, such as narrowing the bilateral trade gap.On Friday, a number of top Federal Reserve officials and regional bank presidents are slated to speak, including William Dudley, John Williams, and Esther George. On Wednesday, the U.S. central bank kept short-term interest rates unchanged. The fed funds rate that's charged on overnight cash infusions to major lenders currently hovers at a 1.5%-1.75% target range.CME futures see a nearly 45% probability that the Fed will raise the fed funds rate three more times to a target range of 2.25%-2.5%, slightly down from recent days. Numerous money center banks, Wall Street investment giants and regional lenders have recently been hit with intense selling.Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Bank of America (BAC) have either sliced below or came close to touching their 200-day moving averages. But some fast-growing banks, such as Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) and SVB Financial (SIVB), have been holding up much more firmly.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on leading stocks, breakouts, sell signals, and financial markets.)RELATED:Inside The Big Picture?

379,ADS,"Will the current creep up in interest rates slow demand in the vacation-resort time share market? One executive answers an emphatic, ""No.""Mike Flaskey, CEO of Diamond Resorts, says his firm is ""very bullish"" and aims to keep expanding in hot leisure destinations such as Hawaii. One piece of proof: the company's recent $225 million purchase of The Modern Honolulu in Oahu.Diamond will upgrade it to meet customers' demands for luxury-style suite accommodations that feature full-size kitchens and one- or two-bedroom formats.""It's a four-star property. We're going to go through it floor by floor,"" Flaskey told IBD during an interview Monday at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, Calif.Flaskey said that Diamond Resorts generates roughly $100 million in annual sales centered on its collection of membership-based hotels across the entire Hawaiian isles. While Las Vegas is Diamond's top sales market, Flaskey believes Hawaii will in time take the top spot.One leg of Diamond's business is financing the purchase of customers' points-based time share ownership. Flaskey says the typical customer makes a 15% down payment on an average transaction of $24,000. Then he or she borrows to pay off the rest via a loan from Diamond.""Middle America is our customer. The usual household income is between $110,000 and $140,000,"" Flaskey said. ""They are very comfortable with making a regular payment"" to fund the buy. Plus, 30% of Diamond's customers pay off the outstanding loan before maturity.Flaskey's bullish sentiment dovetails with the rising fortunes in recent years among publicly traded hotel companies.The lodging industry veteran foresees the total public market value of timeshare-oriented companies rising to nearly $37 billion within a couple of years. That's up nearly fourfold since the fall of 2013, when Diamond Resorts and competitor Marriott Vacations Worldwide (VAC) totaled less than $10 billion in market cap.Marriott Vacations fell more than 8% in big volume Monday. Plus, shares undercut the 200-day moving average on news it's buying Miami-based ILG (ILG). The operator of the Interval International ""exchange network"" allows timeshare owners the opportunity to access other properties.IBD's Leisure-Lodging group has faded within rankings of 197 industries for six-month price performance. Through Monday, the 15-member group ranked 79th, down from 64th six weeks ago. But seven companies, nearly half of the total, carry a Relative Price Strength Rating of 80 or higher. They include Hyatt (H), Hilton Worldwide (HLT) and Marriott (MAR). All three stocks are forming new bases after decent run-ups since the fourth quarter of last year.In the same group, China Lodging (HTHT) shows the best ratings from IBD Stock Checkup, including a best possible 99 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99. The diversified hotel chain broke the $1 billion sales barrier in 2017, growing the top line by 25% to $1.22 billion. China Lodging earned a record $2.66 a share, up 46%.The best stocks in the market tend to break out of well-formed bases, such as the cup with handle, while having strong RS ratings. In the same lodging group, Hilton Grand Vacations (HGV) shows a 79 RS score and an 85 Composite on IBD Stock Checkup. The stock has risen as much as 75% since its debut in January 2017.Diamond Resorts had traded on the NYSE from its July 2013 debut until September 2016, when private equity giant Apollo Global Management completed its $2.2 billion acquisition.The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury bond hit 3% last week for the first time since January 2014. The yield has more than doubled from a July 2016 low near 1.37%.The Federal Reserve is not expected to hike the cost of money at the end of two-day meeting Wednesday. Futures traders, though, are seeing a nearly 50-50 chance that the fed funds rate will reach a 2.25%-2.5% target level by December. That implies three more rate hikes of a quarter point each for the rest of the year.The current fed funds target is 1.5%-1.75%.RELATED:Where Is The Stock Market Headed Right Now?

The new company would be called T-Mobile..T-Mobile plunged 6.26% to 60.51 on the stock market today while Sprint tumbled 13.7% to close at 5.61. Sprint shareholders also digested a disappointing valuation of Sprint in the deal hammered out by parents SoftBank (SFTBY) and Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY). While Deutsche Telekom struck a favorable deal with Japan's SoftBank, shares in the German phone company fell a fraction on Monday in trading in Europe.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Regulatory approval is a tossup in our view,"" UBS analyst John Hodulik said in his note to clients.If the deal is blocked by regulators, Sprint has the most to lose, analysts say. That's because debt-laden Sprint's competitive position is much weaker than T-Mobile, which has been gaining share vs. Verizon Communications (VZ) and AT&T (T). Plus, a breakup fee is not included in the merger agreement.One question is whether federal regulators will approve a merger that reduces the number of national wireless firms to three from four. The other two major players in the market are Verizon and AT&T.Further, foreign ownership could be a hot potato amid rising trade tensions between the Trump administration and Germany, says one analyst.""One may ask how the current U.S. administration, which places much emphasis on 'putting America first,' will view the creation of a major foreign-controlled operator that aims to deliver significant synergies to its German and Japanese majority shareholders — no matter how these synergies are pitched,"" Jefferies analyst Ulrich Rathe said in his report.President Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, a move opposed by German business and Chancellor Angela Merkel. The U.S. ran a nearly $65 billion trade deficit in goods with Germany last year. President Trump has been critical of Merkel's trade policies, saying German imports have damaged the U.S. manufacturing industry in such areas as car production.Before the merger announcement, Softbank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son had courted President Trump with pledges to invest in the U.S. and create jobs.""While we believe the merger has an improved chance of regulatory approval given management's outlook for job creation, there are likely to remain concerns about customer concentration and the impact on overall consumer pricing given that T-Mobile and Sprint were market leaders in pricing,"" William Blair analyst Jim Breen said in his note.Sprint and T-Mobile promise to sustain competition by investing in next-generation 5G technology.

389,ADS,"Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) rode the surge in oil prices to even greater heights, posting a profit not seen since the days of $100 a barrel. Investors were displeased that the company didn't take them along for the ride.XWhile French rival Total (TOT) has started disbursing the rewards of rising energy prices -- with higher dividends and share buybacks -- Shell has other priorities, at least for now. Chief Financial Officer Jessica Uhl declined to say when her planned $25 billion to $30 billion stock-repurchase program would start, telling reporters on a call that she wanted to focus on debt reduction first.There are two big reasons for the company's caution. First, it still has to pay off the acquisition of BG Group Plc in 2016, a deal that's turbo charged natural gas earnings but left Shell heavily indebted. Second, its cash flow -- little changed from a year earlier despite higher oil prices -- ""may not necessarily support"" the planned buybacks, according to RBC Capital Markets.Earnings at Europe's largest energy company vaulted ahead of the upswing in crude to an average of $67 in the first quarter, reaping the benefits of years of cost cuts. Adjusted net income was $5.32 billion last quarter, compared with $3.75 billion a year earlier. That surpassed analysts expectations of $5.2 billion, rising to a level only consistently seen when oil traded for more than $100.Get Free Access To IBD Digital Through April 29

""It's a little bit lighter than what I was expecting.""Shell's free cash flow was sufficient to fund the company's cash dividends and interest payments in the first quarter, which wasn't always the case during the oil-price slump. Like its peers, Shell was forced to make some payments to investors in shares during the downturn, known as a scrip dividend, while also borrowing to fund the cash portion of the payout.Those newly created shares diluted the holdings of some investors, who have maintained a sharp focus on the timing of the buybacks required to offset the impact. Shell wasn't able to offer a clear answer on what could trigger the repurchases.""It's an integrated decision. I've provided enough insight,"" CFO Uhl told reporters in response to several questions about buybacks.That situation should change.

399,ADS,"Japan's Takeda Pharmaceuticals clinched the $62 billion acquisition of Shire (SHPG) early Tuesday after a six-week tussle between the two companies in which Allergan (AGN) also was briefly interested in a possible merger.If approved, it will be the largest overseas purchase by a Japanese company, according to Dealogic. Dealogic says that with debt, the deal is worth $81.5 billion. Takeda will add its roughly $33 billion market cap to Shire's, which is north of $49 billion. The new Takeda will be close in size to Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Eli Lilly (LLY).RBC analyst Douglas Miehm said the deal alleviates some concerns, notably that the Japanese drugmaker could de-lever sufficiently and that its dividend will remain intact. The firm expects to general annual pretax cost synergies of $1.4 billion by the end of the third year.""We do anticipate the deal spread to remain wider than normal given the complexity of the transaction requiring approval in various geographies, ability to realize synergies, especially R&D (research and development) and long-dated closing date,"" he said in a note to clients.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The companies expect the deal to close in the first half of 2019.Under the terms of the deal, Shire shareholders will receive $30.33 in cash and either 0.839 new Takeda shares or 1.678 Takeda American depositary receipts for each Shire share.

It's also expected to provide a return on interest above Takeda's cost of capital over the same time period.Takeda confirmed that it still needs approval from two-thirds of its existing shareholders.

407,ADS,"Shares of Alibaba stock, one of the best Chinese stocks in recent years, have been suffering from a lack of buying demand. The weakness comes after a bullish follow-through day for the Nasdaq last week.A breakout during the week ended Jan. 26 was powerful as shares of Alibaba (BABA) surged 11.5% in strong volume. But new buyers were disappointed when shares lost nearly 9% the following week in higher volume. Volume during that down week surged 50% above the 10-week average as well.Big sellers in a stock immediately after a breakout is never a good sign. In Alibaba's case, it foreshadowed more price weakness.Alibaba's stock is currently testing support at the 200-day moving average, a longer-term support level. The test comes after Alibaba gapped below the 50-day line on March 22 in heavy volume.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHow can a stock like Alibaba turn into a laggard amid seemingly bright fundamentals?Sales growth accelerated nicely in the latest reported quarter, up 66% from a year ago to $12.75 billion. In Q3 last year, the top line increased 47%. For the current quarter, sales are seen rising 52% to $9.28 billion. Annual earnings estimates are also robust, with EPS this year expected to rise 54% from 2017 to $5.27.The lack of buying interest is due, in part, to a slowdown in institutional demand. Alibaba's up-down volume ratio is a tepid 1.0, while its Accumulation/Distribution Rating has faltered to C- on a scale of A to E.Several recent higher-volume declines are the culprit. Alibaba stock is not under heavy distribution, but signs of institutional selling started in early February. Three above-average volume declines from Feb. 1-5 were a sign of it.New signs of institutional buying would strengthen Alibaba's technical picture. Watch for higher-volume gains from here. The stock's 50-day moving average is a potential resistance level to watch. But if mutual funds and other big investors start buying shares again, a move back above the 50-day line is possible.A double-bottom pattern could even form, but note that Alibaba's latest pullback didn't undercut the low of the prior base (164.25). That means any new base that forms would be the third-stage variety after a strong move in 2017. A general rule of thumb is to buy breakouts from early-stage bases, not later-stage patterns.Keep in mind that when stocks move they tend to move in groups, and that appears to be the case with China stocks in general. In the latest IBD 50, for example, buying demand has also dried up in China Lodging (HTHT), TAL Education (TAL) and Weibo (WB).For now, the top China name in the IBD 50 is Baozun (BZUN), which continues to hold near highs.RELATED:Alibaba Invests Another $2 Billion Into Leading SE Asia E-Commerce Site LazadaBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsIPO Stock News And Analysis: Find Today's Top New Issues

410,ADS,"Whether or not Walt Disney's (DIS) acquisition of 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) entertainment assets goes through, Disney CEO Bob Iger assured investors late Tuesday that the ESPN+ streaming service and the upcoming stand-alone Disney pay-TV platform would not be dependent on the deal.But without Fox, Hulu — jointly owned by Disney, Comcast (CMCSA)'s NBCUniversal, Time Warner (TWX) and Fox (for now, until Disney's acquisition of its entertainment assets is complete) — will be deprived of some content as Disney looks to pump the streaming service with more original programming.Iger nodded to that goal on the call, telling analysts that ""much"" of Hulu's future original programming would come from both Disney and Fox. The merger of assets would bring Fox shows such as ""The Simpsons"" and ""Empire,"" to name a few, not to mention the entirety of FX Networks and National Geographic Channels under Disney's wing.Those remarks follow Hulu's update last week that it now has 20 million subscribers. That's still less than half of what Netflix (NFLX) claims stateside, but a formidable figure as the streaming platform stakes out its own turf in the entertainment arena and tries to build revenue streams in ways that its ad-less rival cannot.Hulu also inked a multiyear deal with DreamWorks Animation, stealing away the kids content creator from Netflix. Netflix said in December that it would release half a dozen original DreamWorks Animation Television series on the service in 2018.But Hulu's announcement last week means that it, too, will soon have DreamWorks content, and exclusive content at that. The platform and studio are teaming up to develop original kids and family series based on current DreamWorks franchises and movies, to be released in 2020. Starting next year, Hulu will be the only place where American viewers can watch DreamWorks movies such as ""How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World"" and ""Trolls 2"" online.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The dystopian series, which became the first streaming show to win the Emmy for best drama, last week began its second season. Hulu claimed the season-two premiere doubled viewership vs. the first season.While Netflix has shied away from featuring ads, Hulu plans to debut ""ad-supported downloadable content,"" in which advertisers can insert their commercials into shows and movies that users have downloaded on their devices. The company is also going to start offering ad space in its live-TV subscription service.Netflix shares edged up 0.2% to 326.89 in the  stock market today.

411,ADS,"Exxon Mobil (XOM) said it would focus on boosting shareholder value after missing earnings views for a second straight quarter Friday, as output slipped despite the recent surge in oil prices, while Chevron (CVX) topped profit forecasts.XExxon is focused on ""growing shareholder value"" as its first priority, then on investments and raising the dividend, before looking at share buybacks, said Jeff Woodbury, head of investor relations, during the company's first-quarter earnings call.But he added that buybacks ""remain on the table"" and will be looked at on a quarter-to-quarter basis.In the earnings release, the company also said it doesn't plan to use buybacks to reduce outstanding shares but will buy shares to offset dilution related to benefit plans and programs.With crude prices at the highest levels in more than three years, hopes have been higher that oil companies will return more capital to shareholders after years of being cautious with cash.But on Thursday Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) reported its highest profit since oil prices were above $100 a barrel, but declined to say when a planned $25 billion-$30 billion buyback would start and instead prioritized debt reduction.Exxon's cash flow from operations and asset sales rose 12.4% in Q1 to $9.96 billion, the highest since 2014.

437,ADS,"With an oil renaissance underway in the United States, it's a good time to be a refiner, especially when you're HollyFrontier (HFC) and at the forefront of American energy stocks.As favorable economic conditions fatten margins, HollyFrontier's shares are surging. It's sitting in a sweet spot, reaping the benefit of low acquisition costs for crude oil. Yet it sells refined petroleum under a higher pricing standard.""The whole refining space is the beneficiary of a fairly wide spread between Brent crude oil in Europe and the North American-based WTI (West Texas Intermediate) crude oil,"" CFRA analyst Stewart Glickman told Investor's Business Daily.The current pricing dynamic for Dallas-based HollyFrontier is simple. The company says 100% of its purchased crude barrels are WTI-based. That means its local crude acquisition costs are driven off what is now a low WTI price. But once it refines the product and sends it out to customers like Shell (RDSA) — one of its biggest customers — it's able to sell into global markets under the more costly Brent standard under which overseas refiners operate.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseRight now, that gap is roughly $5 a barrel, and Glickman says the spread is widening. That can be attributed to ""fairly good"" compliance with output cuts by OPEC and Russia. Further, U.S. shale production that has ""surprised to the upside,"" Glickman said.Another thing working in HollyFrontier's favor is the location of its refineries, mostly in the middle of the U.S. Analysts say it's unusual compared with other refiners, many of whom are centered in the Gulf Coast region.""Although it's smaller than its Gulf Coast peers, (HollyFrontier's) refineries are competitively well positioned,"" Morningstar analyst Allen Good said in a Feb. 22 report.HollyFrontier operates five refineries across the U.S., located in Wyoming, Utah, Kansas, Oklahoma and New Mexico. In particular, a competitive advantage for HollyFrontier is its proximity to the Canadian border.""Canadian crude is extremely price disadvantaged right now,"" Glickman noted. ""If you are a Canadian producer trying to export your crude to the U.S., there's an awful lot of production and very little take-away capacity.""That results in even lower initial crude prices, and ""that disadvantage for Canada works in HollyFrontier's favor,"" Glickman said.Of the 450,000 to 470,000 barrels per day HollyFrontier refines, some 80,000 to 100,000 barrels of that are from Canada. The other base oil comes from the Bakken shale formation, Permian Basin and other hot shale-drilling spots.HollyFrontier stock broke out of a cup-with-handle base with a 50.60 buy point on April 4. Volume on the breakout was lighter than average, which isn't ideal. Heavy volume on a breakout indicates institutional support.Still, the relative strength line hit a new high before the stock hit a new price high, which is bullish. The line is continuing higher along the run. The relative strength line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500.Shares are now extended roughly 15% from the buy point, and were flat in Friday trading to near 58.25.While energy stocks have been on a steady climb as of late, oil refining is a ""volatile and competitive"" industry, Glickman said in a March 22 report.For now, that volatility has been to the upside. Crude oil prices hit a more than three-year high of $69 per barrel Thursday. According to S&P Global Platts-owned PIRA Energy Group, the projected price for WTI is $68 per barrel this year and $63 per barrel in 2019.The volatility of the price of crude has an impact on energy stocks. Glickman says, though, it's less important if WTI ""slips a bit"" than if the spread between it and Brent remains high.""As long as that spread remains high, (HollyFrontier) should be fine,"" he said.Morningstar's Good expects the spread ""to remain wider than historical levels (before 2010) when WTI and Brent traded close to par. Ultimately, we think the transportation costs to move light crude from the midcontinent to the Gulf Coast result in a long-term WTI average differential to Brent of $5 per barrel.""HollyFrontier primarily plays in the downstream, or refining, space. Through its majority stake in master limited partnership Holly Energy Partners (HEP), it also has midstream, or transportation and storage, operations.Glickman notes that the MLP model itself is not a concern. But the increasing level of distributable cash flow, which HollyFrontier benefits from as the general partner, could potentially result in Holly Energy Partner's abandonment of the MLP structure.Aside from its relationship with Holly Energy Partners and crude-margin tightening, another potential concern for HollyFrontier is regulatory risk. A new regulation that makes it more difficult for HollyFrontier to obtain, ship or refine product could weigh on margins, Glickman said. But he also noted that risk is ""part and parcel"" for any investment in the oil and gas industry.The shale boom in recent years has no doubt reinvigorated the oil and gas industry in the United States.""Shale has a seat at the big-boy table,"" Maynard Holt, chief executive of energy industry-focused investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co., told IBD at the CERAWeek oil and gas conference in Houston earlier this year. ""Shale is here, it's in a politically stable place which just improved its tax regime, where services are plenty, were labor is plenty, where you deal with landowners and not governments. It is arguably the best place on the planet if you're choosing where you want to invest (in the oil industry).""HollyFrontier is seeing a big benefit from corporate tax reform, with its rate shrinking to 21% from 35%.""The reforms to the U.S. tax code encourage capital investments and lower the corporate rate to better enable manufacturers to compete in the global market,"" HollyFrontier Chief Executive George Damiris said during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call on Feb. 21.HollyFrontier is increasing its capital expenditures this year to $450 million from $275 million in 2017. While that is a ""big step up,"" Glickman says this is a ""very acceptable problem"" since the company is generating over $1 billion in cash flow.Another way HollyFrontier could get more competitive vs. other energy stocks would be through an acquisition. But the company is being decidedly conservative on that front.""We've seen a number of deals in 2017 that we participated in the process but didn't end up winning, obviously, otherwise we'd have announced the deal. We're going to continue to look and only pull the trigger when we see value,"" Damiris said on the call.HollyFrontier is set to issue first-quarter results before the open on May 2. The company is expected to swing to a profit of 38 cents a share vs. a loss of 19 cents a share last year, according to analysts with Zacks Investment Research. Revenue is projected to rise 9% to $3.36 billion, a deceleration from the prior quarter's 35% sales growth.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, CoalStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksCrude Oil Prices Are Up Sharply, But Is The Bakken Shale Play Back?

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSpeculation about a Shire-Takeda merger has been swirling since late March. Since then, Takeda has made three bids on Shire. In each case, Shire's board determined the bids ""significantly undervalue"" the firm's growth prospects and pipeline.Takeda confirmed it put forth a buyout bid for Shire worth about $66 per share, comprised of cash and stock. Both firms say they are willing to continue negotiating. Still, Takeda is confident it ""remains well positioned"" even if negotiations fall through.""Building on Takeda's existing momentum, the acquisition of Shire would accelerate its transformation and result in a global, value-based R&D-driven biopharmaceutical leader headquartered in Japan,"" Takeda said in a prepared statement.The short-lived interest from Allergan came as a surprise, Leerink analyst Etzer Darout said in a note. The firm has said it could become acquisitive and is looking at strategic options.""A combination with Shire introduces some growth challenges in out-years, which are reflected in the negative stock reaction,"" he said.Shire is likely to face erosion of attention deficit hyperactivity medicine Vyvanse beginning in 2023 and significant erosion of its hemophilia business as it competes with rival Roche (RHHBY). Allergan would have had to justify the bid to its shareholders, he said.The Shire interest comes amid a flurry of biotech acquisitions that kicked off earlier this year when Celgene (CELG) announced its plan to buy Juno Therapeutics and Sanofi (SNY) unveiled plans to acquire Bioverativ (BIVV) and Ablynx (ABLX).Novartis (NVS) sold its share of GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) consumer health unit for $13 billion and used part of the proceeds to fund its $8.7 billion plan to acquire AveXis (AVXS). Merck KGaA agreed to sell its over-the-counter unit to Proctor & Gamble (PG), days after it was rumored Mylan (MYL) might buy it.Earlier this week, Shire said it would sell it cancer unit to France's Servier for $2.4 billion.Analysts have speculated that Celgene could also be on the lookout for more acquisitions with Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO) and Jounce Therapeutics (JNCE) as potential targets. Amgen (AMGN) also has a huge war chest and is facing competition for its older medicines.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityLong-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFsSell And Take Profits Or Hold?

445,ADS,"Major indexes, after catching their breath on Tuesday, struggled to hold on to early mild gains in Wednesday-morning trading and fell broadly. Meanwhile, leading leisure-sector play China Lodging (HTHT) got burned with big losses after reporting solid results, but still has the opportunity to form a new base.Among stocks in the 30-member Dow Jones industrial average, at least four members dropped 1 point or more, including industrial heavyweights Boeing (BA)and United Technologies (UTX). Boeing dropped 13.29 points, or nearly 4%, and undercut its 50-day moving average in heavy turnover.Boeing's big decline represents the first time the Dow Jones industrial component dropped below the medium-term support level since breaking out of a flat base at 185.81 in May 2017, and thus serves as a sell signal. Holders can consider taking at least partial profits. However, those with a very big profit cushion in Boeing can decide to sit tight and see if the stock does one or both of these two things: 1) form a constructive new base, such as a cup with handle, flat base or double bottom; or 2) find institutional buying support at or near the 50-day line or the longer-term 200-day moving average.Boeing has solid profit estimates from Wall Street (up 17% to $14.07 a share in 2018, up 19% in 2019), and the aerospace giant has halted a four-quarter slump in the top line as sales gained 2% and 9% vs. year-ago levels in the past two quarters.But some observers on Wall Street are watching closely for any signs of retaliatory measures that America's trading partners may take against key U.S. products, which could include aircraft.United Tech (the aircraft engine, elevator and security systems manufacturer) is forming a new base after breaking out of a saucer with handle at 123.38 on Dec. 11 and gaining as much as 13% before its latest correction.At 11:30 a.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite slumped 0.4% after opening with a gain of nearly 0.4%. The S&P 500 sank more than 0.5% and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 1%. Volume is running higher on the NYSE vs. the same time Tuesday.Soft U.S. retail sales for February (down 0.1%, vs. the Econoday forecast for a 0.4% pickup) did not initially spur widespread selling. But investors are expressing concerns over the impact that new U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum may have on global trade.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAs noted in The Big Picture column, the major indexes on Tuesday logged a fresh distribution day, or bout of intense professional selling, as the Nasdaq fell 1% in higher volume vs. the prior session. The S&P 500 dropped 0.6% as NYSE turnover edged higher. But with most leading stocks acting all right and the two key indexes now having retaken their respective 50-day moving averages, the market's current outlook remains at ""confirmed uptrend"" for now.Steel makers haven't made much headway in the wake of historic tariffs of 25% set on steel imports by President Trump, although the White House has set exemptions for Canada and Mexico amid three-party talks to rethink the Nafta trade treaty. However, the highly rated members of the group are generally holding up and are beating the S&P 500.U.S. Steel (X) fell more than 2% and is headed for a fifth down day in a row. Watch to see if institutional buying support can prevent a severe undercut of the stock's rising 50-day moving average.U.S. Steel holds a 92 RS Rating on a scale of 1 to 99. Shares are up 13% since Jan. 1, beating a 3.3% lift by the S&P 500.Wall Street expects U.S. Steel, which has a $7 billion market value and is thus a midcap firm, to increase earnings by 98% this year to $3.84 a share, then boost earnings by 17% in 2019 to $4.50.Tenaris (TS), part of IBD Leaderboard, and Steel Dynamics (STLD) are also group leaders, rising mildly after successful tests of support at their 50-day moving averages.Tenaris is slightly below a 36.43 buy point in a long, deep cup with handle.This week's pullback looks normal so far, given that Tenaris has rallied nicely for four weeks in a row.Notice on a MarketSmith weekly chart how in the week ended Feb. 9, while IBD's current outlook shifted to ""market in correction"" in The Big Picture column, Tenaris respected its 40-week line. That's bullish.The Street sees the expert in oil and gas well steel pipes increasing earnings 43% to $1.10 a share this year and 47% in 2019.Meanwhile, China Lodging (HTHT) dropped more than 10% to 131.70 in heavy turnover and gave back all of its year-to-date gains and then some. But the stock is trying to hold near the 130 level, where it found institutional buying support during the early February market sell-off. The stock is also trading above its long-term 200-day moving average for now.The hotel chain operator late on Tuesday notched an 86% jump in Q4 profit to 52 cents a share, accelerating from EPS gains of 19% and 58% in the prior two quarters, on a 42% rise in revenue to $340.1 million, the second highest for any quarter.After-tax margin jumped 290 basis points to 11.2%.Through Tuesday's close, China Lodging ranked No. 10 in the IBD 50. Shares had already made a stunning climb, rising more than 400% from a first-stage breakout from a cup without handle at 33.10 during the week ended March 18, 2016.This year, the midcap firm formed a new cup with handle, but it was a late-stage base (meaning the risk of failure was greatly elevated) and the stock hadn't yet broken out ahead of Q4 results.In other markets, crude oil was drifting near break-even after a report showed weekly U.S. inventories rose to 5 million barrels in the week ended March 9. WTI slipped 0.1% to $60.64 a barrel.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond fell to around 2.83%, off from a Feb. 21 high of around 2.94%. The Federal Reserve meets on interest rates on March 20-21 and is widely expected to increase the fed funds rate by a quarter point to a range of 2.25%-2.5%.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on stocks, investing, growth companies and financial markets.)RELATED:When To Sell Stocks: A Big Drop Through This Support Level Means Institutions Are Selling HardStocks Near A Buy ZoneIf The Stock Market Keeps Rising, Can You Spot This Rare Bullish Chart Pattern?Which Way Is The Stock Market Headed From Here?

Producer price data from the Labor Department was more positive, up 0.2% in February, half of January's 0.4% gain and in line with expectations. Core prices, minus energy and food, also rose 0.2% and met economists' targets.The Energy Information Administration delivers its weekly oil inventories update at 10:30 a.m. ET.On the Dow, Nike swung out to an early lead, rising in strong trade as the stock looked to break free of its recently stick 50-day moving average.Ford roared to the top of teh S&P 500, rising more than 4% after J.P.Morgan upgraded the stock to overweight, from underweight, and hoisted the price target 50%, to 15.

Amazon, Kroger (KR) and Target (TGT) had previously announced similar services. Walmart shares rose 0.4%.Insurer Prudential (PUK) put up one of the morning's best moves, rising nearly 6% after announcing plans to spin off M&G Prudential, its European savings and investment unit.  The gain sent shares back above 10-week support and up the right side of a three-month base pattern.The fourth-quarter earnings season was grinding to a close and investors were hard on slip ups early Wednesday.

Even as the U.S. is reviving its own oil industry and exporting, Libya managed to ship more crude to America in the fourth quarter than a year earlier while supplies from Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Iraq declined, the report showed.""Libya is holding onto its recent gains,"" the IEA said.

448,ADS,"The rapidly growing field of professional video game competitions, called esports, is not expected to be a huge business for game publishers for some time, but it's already paying off for graphics-chip maker Nvidia (NVDA), which makes processors for running high-end gaming PCs.X That's one finding from a report on esports released Tuesday by Wall Street investment research firm Bernstein.""While much of the focus (at Nvidia) has been on the AI (artificial intelligence) and data-center opportunity, gaming still makes up well over 50% of the business, and has been growing very strongly over the past several years,"" Bernstein said in a note to clients. Gaming processor sales increased at a compound annual growth rate of 33% from 2012 through 2016, the firm said.""Going forward we model gaming growth sustaining in the double digits,"" Bernstein said.

But shoe, auto parts, truck, construction machinery, movie, aerospace and wireless telecom service stocks fell 1% or more.Just three of the 30 components within the Dow industrial average climbed 1 point or more, including IBM (IBM) (still deep within a base) and Goldman Sachs (GS) (trying to clear a 273.89 entry in a new flat base). Fellow Dow Jones 30 member Intel (INTC) struggled, losing 0.84, or 1.6%, to 51.35. Volume was running 12% above average.Intel last week hopped out of a flawed cup base that formed in less than six weeks. Yet the chipmaking titan is having a positive 2018 so far, up more than 10%. The Santa Clara, Calif., tech bellwether has enjoyed healthy double-digit profit increases in five of the six past quarters, up 21%, 4%, 22%, 22%, 26% and 37% vs. year-ago levels.The Street expects Intel to grow first-quarter profit by 8% to 71 cents a share.Four components in the price-weighted Dow also sank 1 point or more, including Home Depot (HD), Caterpillar (CAT) and United Technologies (UTX).Leading companies, in terms of fundamentals, relative price strength and quality fund sponsorship, include Alibaba (BABA) (basing), Broadcom (AVGO) (also in a base), Booking Holdings (BKNG) (up 7% from a breakout point at 2,068.09 and thus extended) and Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) (slightly out of the 5% proper buy zone after clearing a flat base at 170.40).Ligand was showcased in IBD's Stock Spotlight column on March 6, two days before the stock broke out of its five-week flat base, one of the most important chart patterns that can help growth investors time their buys for maximum gains and minimum risk during a confirmed stock market uptrend.On Friday, the IBD Big Picture column noted that the rise by the Nasdaq composite to all-time highs ended the ""Uptrend under pressure"" phase that began on March 1.All four companies have a record of smashing the performance of the S&P 500 and other benchmarks. Only Broadcom, still in a quest to acquire fellow wireless chip technology giant Qualcomm (QCOM), is lagging the S&P 500 in year-to-date performance. Broadcom, however, gapped up more than 3% to 262.58 in fast turnover and is now up more than 1% year to date.Broadcom, the product of a mega-merger with Singapore's Avago Technologies, is up 554% since clearing a nearly 18-month base-on-base pattern with a 39.84 buy point in the week ended Sept. 20, 2013. The company has superior earnings growth, with profit rising 29%, 38%, 51%, 46%, 42% and 32% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters.Revenue picked up 119%, 125%, 134%, 18%, 18%, and 17% in the same time frame. The merger between Broadcom and Avago accounted largely for the triple-digit top-line gains in prior quarters.Analysts see earnings in the January-ended fiscal first quarter rising 39% to $5.03 a share on a 28% jump in sales to $5.32 billion.As noted in IBD's Earnings Calendar, Broadcom is slated to report Q1 results on Thursday.Like the one formed recently by Ligand, a good flat base must form over a minimum five weeks and correct no greater than 10% to 15% from head to toe. Such action indicates tight price action and a general unwillingness among large fund managers to dump their shares.Ligand has scored a ninth straight advance, rising more than 2% to 179.92 in volume running more than 100% above usual levels. Before the stock broke out, its relative strength line jumped into new high ground, a bullish sign.The relative strength line, painted in blue in all IBD charts and in MarketSmith, compares a stock's price performance with the S&P 500.On Feb. 21, the specialist in developing treatments for numerous difficult and chronic diseases posted a 77% leap in fourth-quarter profit to $1.31 a share as revenue rose 32% to $50.5 million.As noted in this IBD New America piece, Ligand earns royalties based on the therapies and technology platforms it sells to larger pharmaceutical and biotech firms. In February, management noted it currently has 165 platforms in development together with more than 95 business partners.Ligand joined IBD Leaderboard last week.Shares are up more than 30% since Jan. 1, while at 2786 the S&P 500 is up 4.2%. The Nasdaq composite is up nearly 10%.Alibaba, one of China's leading e-commerce firms, had a huge 2017 as shares rolled 96% higher that year, vs. a 19.4% lift by the S&P 500.The stock sprinted higher in January, then caved in step with the market. However, notice how the stock refused to sink below its long-term 200-day moving average (visible as the black line on a MarketSmith chart). After a strong run-up, it's not uncommon for leading stocks to not only sharply undercut the 50-day moving average but also test buying support at the 200-day line as well.The 200-day moving average traces a stock's average price close over the past 200 trading sessions, or roughly 10 months' of price action. You want to see the 200-day line rising. Plus, a leading stock will lead its 50- and 200-day moving averages higher.Alibaba has fallen a mild 18% in its current base, which so far has the makings of a cup base.The latest pullback is not a proper handle. Why? The midpoint test shows that the handle didn't form up high enough within the cup itself.The midpoint of the cup (the base's intraday high plus intraday low, divided by 2) is 187.54, while the midpoint of the handle is 185.30.In a good cup with handle, the midpoint of the handle is usually higher than the base's midpoint. A good cup with handle must also form within a minimum seven weeks.Alibaba has scored EPS gains of 39%, 30%, 37%, 60%, 63% and 25% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters. Such results help boost the stock's Earnings Per Share Rating to a 97 on a scale of 1 to 99 in IBD Stock Checkup, and the megacap member of IBD's Retail-Internet industry group shows an equally robust 98 Composite Rating.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see first-quarter earnings rising 49% to 94 cents a share.One concern is that fourth-quarter aftertax margin fell by 970 basis points to 32.5% vs. the year-ago period. That broke a two-quarter string of rising net margins.The Dow transportation average, a 17.3% gainer in 2017, fell nearly 0.6% before rebounding some and is now off 0.2%. At 10,712, it's up almost 1% since Jan. 1.In other financial markets, WTI crude oil futures fell 1.7% to $60.92 a barrel while gold, silver and copper futures backtracked 0.3% to 0.6%.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond edged lower to 2.88%, still up from 2.41% at the start of the year.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more analysis and commentary on growth stocks, breakouts, and financial markets.)RELATED:Inside IBD's Stock Spotlight: Can This Hot China Consumer Spending Play Break Out Again?Who Are The Global Stock Leaders On Wall Street?Intel, Broadcom, Qualcomm Buzz Has A Lot To Do With AppleThese 5 Top China Nets Have New Bases, Buy PointsHow To Score Big Profits With A Small Account?

Aggressive investors could treat 125.40 as an early entry point.

460,ADS,"Shares of YY.com (YY) flashed a sell signal Tuesday as the stock plunged through its 50-day moving average in huge volume, following its fourth-quarter earnings report late Monday.YY stock plunged 12.3% to close at 118.76 on the stock market today. YY shares initially broke out in mid-July with a 61.62 buy point. Prior to Tuesday's action, YY shares more than doubled from that breakout.Setting off the sell alarms was that YY's trading volume, which was approaching 9 million shares by mid-afternoon, marked more than six times the company's average daily volume. Shares also traded a wide range between 117 and 140.39 and were hovering near the low end of that range late in the session. Further, the stock has crashed through its 10-week moving average.YY, a fast-growing provider of internet live streaming services, reported fourth-quarter revenue of $557.4 million, beating the consensus estimate of $551 million. Adjusted earnings of $2.27 a shares thumped estimates of $1.84. But YY's revenue outlook fell short. It projected first-quarter revenue to be in the range of $472.5 million to $496.2 million. The midpoint of $484 million is below the consensus estimate of $493 million. During the earnings conference call, analysts also expressed concern about growing competition.Also reporting fourth-quarter earnings early Tuesday was Baozun (BZUN) , which beat consensus estimates. Baozun stock soared 31.1% to finish the regular session at 48.21. Baozun, an e-commerce company that helps major brands navigate China's growing online market opportunity, reported adjusted earnings of 42 cents per share, up 133%, on revenue of $240.6 million, up 31%, both above estimates, as was revenue guidance.More quarterly earning reports are coming.

The consensus on Autohome, which provides an online car-buying service, is for revenue growth of 7% to $268.4 million, and adjusted earnings of 69 cents.Shares of China's two largest e-commerce companies, JD.com (JD) and Alibaba (BABA), were also up. JD.com shares ticked up 0.4% to 43.14. Alibaba gained 3.2% to near 187.37.JD.com, on Friday, reported weaker-than-expected earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter.

461,ADS,"Here is your Investing Action Plan for Tuesday — what you need know as an investor for the coming day.X Sports retail chain Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and China Lodging Group (HTHT) report fourth-quarter earnings. Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) present at the J.P. Morgan Aviation, Transportation and Industrials Conference.Wall Street will also be watching for Consumer Price Index data, a key measure of inflation.Dick's Sporting Goods' fourth-quarter earnings will follow the retailer's decision to stop selling assault-style rifles and raise the minimum age for gun purchases to 21 in the wake of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Kroger (KR) and Walmart (WMT) have also raised their minimum gun-purchase age to 21.American Outdoor Brands (AOBC), the company formerly known as Smith & Wesson Holding, said the decision would have a minimal effect on sales. A former business analyst recently told USA Today that the same was true for Dick's, arguing that its customers go there for apparel and other gear related to team sports rather than firearms.Meanwhile, Dick's has been investing more in e-commerce, but has remained concerned about aggressive competitive discounting from rival retailers.Wall Street expects Dick's fourth-quarter earnings per share to fall 9% to $1.20, with revenue up 10% to $2.732 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. Same-store sales are expected to fall 1.2%, according to Consensus Metrix.Dick's rose 2% to 32.56 in the stock market today. Hibbett Sports (HIBB), which reports on Friday, was down 1.75%. Foot Locker (FL), which this month forecast lackluster sales for the first quarter, rose 1.1%.Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Airlines are set to present at the J.P. Morgan Aviation, Transportation and Industrials Conference. The conference follows United's announcement in January that it would be growing capacity — or an airline's supply of seats and flights — this year, next year and 2020. That decision, combined with the carrier's promise to keep matching fares from low-cost rivals, revived Wall Street's anxieties of a protracted airfare battle.For now, though, some analysts expect that the financial forecasts the airlines are likely to issue during the conference will be good news for airline stocks.""We expect the airlines to update 1Q18 investor guidance, and suspect the updates will be positive given relatively modest industry capacity growth in 1Q18, declining jet fuel costs, and continued global economic improvement,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note.She added: ""If there is even a hint about United reducing their 2018 capacity growth, it would be a key positive driver for the stocks.""Delta edged up 0.1%, while United Air climbed 0.6%.American cleared a 55.70 cup-with-handle base on Friday, but volume was well below normal. Shares rose 0.8% to 56.60, also in light trade. Meanwhile, the relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is at a very short-term high but hasn't made headway since late 2016.Delta and United are in consolidations.China Lodging Group, a hotel operator in China, reports fourth-quarter results amid solid travel demand in the nation, whose economy and middle class have grown over the years. The company as of Sept. 30 operated nearly 3,700 hotels in 375 cities, with much of its business geared toward economy and midtier hotels.Estimates were unavailable from Zacks.Shares found support at their 50-day line Monday, rallying to close up 0.5% at 154.50.The stock is near a 161 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. But China Lodging is in a fourth-stage base. Late-stage bases can work, but they are more likely to fail than first- or second-stage bases.Consumer Price Index data are set to be released by the Labor Department at 8:30 a.m. ET.

462,ADS,"When looking for the best stocks to buy and watch, focus on those with rising relative price strength. One stock that fits that bill is Talend (TLND), which saw a welcome improvement to its Relative Strength (RS) Rating on Thursday, with an upgrade from 88 to 93. X When looking for the best stocks to buy and watch, one factor to watch closely is relative price strength. This unique rating measures market leadership by showing how a stock's price action over the last 52 weeks measures up against that of the other stocks in our database. Decades of market research shows that the market's biggest winners often have an RS Rating of above 80 at the beginning of a new climb.Looking For Winning Stocks? Try This Simple RoutineTalend broke out earlier, but has fallen back below the prior 46.42 entry from a cup without handle. If a stock you're tracking breaks past a buy point then falls 7% or more below the original entry price, it's considered a failed base. It's best to wait for the stock to form a new consolidation and breakout. Also keep in mind that the latest pattern is a later-stage base, which makes it riskier to establish a new position or add shares to an existing one. Talend showed -115% EPS growth in its most recent report. Revenue increased 36%. Talend holds the No. 44 rank among its peers in the Computer Software-Enterprise industry group.

463,ADS,"Major indexes felt investors' chill over news that Gary Cohn is leaving his White House role as chief economic advisor, but the Nasdaq composite continues to prove that it is the index to beat in 2018. However, as seen in recent sessions, the U.S. equity markets continue to show rapid seesawing action as well.X Due to a recent spate of heavy distribution, or pronounced institutional profit-taking, from Feb. 20 to March 1 in both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, IBD's current outlook continues to stand at ""Uptrend under pressure.""At 3 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq shaved its mild losses and is trying to hold above the breakeven level, up 0.1%, despite having multiple large-cap and megacap companies that do business overseas. But in the wake of continued uncertainty over the possibility of trade spats between the U.S. and China, the rest of Asia, and Europe, clearly the selling has been more focused on industrial companies.The Dow Jones industrial average, down at one point 1.4%, has cut its losses to around 0.7%. During session lows, at least half of the 30 components sank 1 point or more. IBM (IBM) was the sole stock within the Dow Industrials to rise 1 point or more.The S&P 500 slid nearly 0.8%, then cut the loss to less than 0.4% with an hour to go in Wednesday's session. At 2707, the large-cap benchmark has shaved its year-to-date gain to 1.6%.The Nasdaq is up 6.7% since Jan. 1.The Russell 2000 gained 0.7% as small caps outperformed. Perhaps institutional investors hold a general view that a budding trade war that focuses on tariffs on select products would hurt larger multinational companies more than smaller firms that sell primarily in the domestic market.The S&P SmallCap 600 is up 0.6%, and at 955 is now up 2% since Jan. 1.While steel stocks are emerging as a new leading sector thanks to strong gains by the likes of United States Steel (X), Steel Dynamics (STLD) and Nucor (NUE), the software, consumer and China sectors of the market continue to do well.Alibaba (BABA), Weibo (WB) and TAL Education (TAL) continue to show nice long-term uptrends and high relative strength. (See a detailed analysis of TAL's chart action near the bottom of this article.)Alibaba, a big winner in 2017, continues to a long trend of higher highs and higher lows. Notice on a daily chart how the Chinese and international facilitator of e-commerce and mobile payments had sold off in line with the early February correction that took the Nasdaq down nearly 12% from its perch. Yet Alibaba, hitting a 2018 year-to-date low of 168.88, did not undercut the Dec. 5 near-term low of 164.25. That's bullish.Plus, Alibaba has been weaving above and below its still-rising 50-day moving average. Such action indicates that the stock is trying to form a new base that could serve as a launching pad for a new breakout and a new run to price highs.When a stock breaks out and hits new highs, everyone in the market is happy, except for short sellers.Alibaba broke out of an eight-week cup with handle at 192.59 on Jan. 24, rallied 7%, then got reeled back into the belly of that chart pattern. So, a new base that potentially forms would technically serve as a base next to a base.Autodesk (ADSK) gapped up on very strong results and gave a rosy outlook based on success with its transition into a ""software as a service"" business model. Adobe Systems (ADBE) has already shown it's succeeded by selling its products online and giving users flexible subscription-based offerings.Both Autodesk and Adobe are members of IBD Leaderboard, which currently shows nine names on its Leaders list. Each of those Leaders has an annotated daily and weekly chart to help users find the right time to buy and the best time to sell to lock in gains and minimize losses.Autodesk jumped past a 131.20 buy point in a three-month base that can be viewed as a double bottom. Last week, the stock briefly surpassed the 119.34 entry in the double bottom. Add 10 cents to the middle peak between the two lows to locate the traditional buy point.Autodesk's sales grew 16% to $553.8 million, posting its best top-line results in more than four years.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

Start NowIn the stock market today, industry groups bucking the market sell-off include cosmetics and personal care, long term medical care, educational software, fiber optics telecom and enterprise software, all up 1% or more.Going back to leading China ADRs, TAL is a perfect example of a company that would appear to be impacted far less from U.S. tariffs on select commodities than other compatriot companies. The leader in for-profit education for China's fast-growing middle class inched up on Wednesday, but more importantly, the large-cap consumer spending play continues to hold near a 36.26 buy point in a new four-month cuplike base.TAL, which has a relatively limited float of 182 million shares, has performed exceptionally well since it initially cleared a 12-week perfect cup with handle at 13.07 on Jan. 19, 2017 (adjusted for a 6-1 stock split later in the year). On that day, the stock vaulted 7.4% in very heavy volume and sprinted past the highest price within the downward-slanting handle within the base. Add 10 cents to a handle's high to find the exact buy point.To see that exact breakout, MarketSmith offers excellent easy-to-use historical charts that allow users to go back decades in time.On the day of TAL's January 2017 breakout, the correct buy point was 77.93, a dime above the handle's high, before the big stock split. In the handle portion of the base, TAL fell just 5% to 74.06. The handle indicates the final shakeout of remaining uncommitted shareholders before fresh new institutional demand comes in to lift the stock and spur the breakout to new highs.Since that breakout, TAL has advanced 200%.Over the same time period, the S&P 500 has gained as much as 27%, excluding dividends.TAL grew its revenue 39%, 38%, 43% and 68% over the past four years. In the fiscal year 2017 ended in February that year, the top line was $1.04 billion, hitting the billion-dollar level for the first time.The Street sees earnings rising 14% to 32 cents a share in FY 2018 (which just ended in February), then leaping another 62% to 52 cents in FY 2019 on revenue increases of 63% to $1.7 billion and 52% to $2.59 billion, respectively.In other financial markets, WTI crude oil futures slumped 2.3% to $61.14 a barrel despite reports that weekly U.S. crude oil inventories came in higher than expected at 2.4 million barrels, suggesting continued strong domestic output. In the prior week, inventories were higher at 3.0 million barrels.Bond traders have been conducting relatively quiet trading, at least from the view of U.S. Treasury long bonds. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note stood at 2.88%, relatively unchanged for the past two sessions and seven basis points below the year-to-date peak of 2.95%.The CME Fed Watch tool for analyzing fed funds futures currently shows no significant change in the probability that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates four times by December. The probability that the fed funds rate will hit a 2.25%-2.5% target range is 34%. This means the majority of bond traders see just three increases of a quarter point each for 2018, with the first one coming up after the Fed holds a two-day meeting on interest rate policy on March 20-21.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on top growth stocks, breakouts, sell signals, and other financial markets.)RELATED:Hot IPO LeadersDo You Know How To Spot This Money-Making Bullish Stock Chart Pattern?Stocks Near A Buy ZoneWill More Hot Growth Stocks Begin Forming This Key Pattern?Autodesk Shines After Its Q4 Results

465,ADS,"Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google plans to ban advertisements related to cryptocurrencies starting in June, joining Facebook (FB) in barring the promotion of an industry that has the potential to change the way the world thinks about money but has faced growing concerns about fraud.XIn a section of  Google's website related to advertising policies and financial services, the search giant said the ban would cover ads for ""Cryptocurrencies and related content (including but not limited to initial coin offerings, cryptocurrency exchanges, cryptocurrency wallets, and cryptocurrency trading advice)"".Facebook announced its decision to ban cryptocurrency-related ads in January. In a blog post, the social media leader said that many companies advertising cryptocurrencies and ICOs were ""not currently operating in good faith.""The decision by Google comes as Bitcoin's value continues to crumble — it was down 9% to $8,313 on Wednesday evening and more than 50% below its peak. However, the digital asset and others continue to gain more mainstream acceptance.Nomura-Instinet analyst Dan Dolev, in a research note Wednesday, said that 60% of Square (SQ) merchants surveyed by the firm said they were willing to accept Bitcoin as a payment.

Coinbase said that the move would give its U.K. customers faster and more secure bank transfers.""Since we began offering our services to European users in 2014, we have seen the crypto space grow significantly,"" Coinbase said in a the blog post. ""The EU grew twice as fast as any of our other markets in 2017, and the UK continues to be our largest market here.""Also Wednesday, the men's magazine Playboy said it is developing an online payment wallet that will support a variety of cryptocurrencies.

466,ADS,"HOUSTON — Offshore oil could be the next big thing again for the energy industry as the once high-cost production technique can now be profitable at today's lower oil prices.X While there is a huge focus on cheap, unconventional onshore drilling, especially in the Permian Basin, deepwater areas may be the next accessible ""super-basin"" for producers.Currently, pumping from deepwater sources is more expensive than pumping from shale formations, but Luca Bertelli, chief exploration officer at Italy's Eni (E), said he believes deepwater can be profitable with oil prices at $50 per barrel.Eni is using some lessons from unconventional shale operations to help make deepwater drilling cheaper, Bertelli said at CERAWeek 2018, a top gathering of energy industry and policy leaders, on Wednesday.He added that digitization and automation of some processes will help lower costs and improve production times to make deepwater drilling cost effective amid lower oil prices.But while the Permian is a single, discrete area, there is no one deepwater zone that could be the next super-basin. Bertelli mentioned the Santos basin in Brazil, while BHP Billiton's (BHP) vice president of exploration, Niall McCormick, said the company is focused on the Gulf of Mexico, western Australia and the Caribbean.Eni's U.S.-listed shares rose 1.4% on the stock market today, while its oil giant peers generally retreated: Exxon Mobil (XOM) lost 2.5%, BP (BP) 0.6%, and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) 1.1%. Chevron (CVX)% rallied for a 0.2% gain.

476,ADS,"The Dow Jones industrial average is capping a solid week of gains with a 1.5% advance Friday afternoon to help lead the major U.S. equity indexes. But more importantly, stocks in numerous sectors are showing strength following good breakouts.X Just one example: Tenaris (TS), the expert in steel pipes for the energy industry, burst out of a long cup with handle at 36.43 as shares rolled 2.5% higher to 37.09. Volume was running 150% above average, just what you like to see on breakout day.Tenaris recently joined IBD Leaderboard. The Luxembourg-based company recently posted hot Q4 results (earnings per share up 575% to 27 cents, sales up 52% to $1.59 billion) and is expected to grow 2018 profit 42% to $1.09 a share.Meanwhile, stocks in the leisure, internet, chip and medical sectors continued to command the upside.Booking Holdings (BKNG), 58.com (WUBA), Bluebird Bio (BLUE) (extended past an aggressive entry at 215.10) and Google operator Alphabet (GOOGL) (forming a new cuplike base) all scored solid gains of more than 1% and continue to act as market leaders.Booking, formerly known as Priceline Group, represents the strength of the airline, cruise and hotel markets. Shares posted a sixth straight gain, rising nearly 1% to 2,170 and edging nearly 5% past a breakout point of 2,068.09. Booking was highlighted in a Stock Market Today column earlier this week.58.com, the Craigslist of China and a former IBD Leaderboard member, is back above its 50-day line as shares jumped more than 6% to 82.41 in heavy turnover. Watch for a potential new cup base to form. The base's left side peak is 87.65.58.com, now a mid-cap firm with a market value of $12 billion, has posted strong earnings in the past four quarters as revenue lifted 24%, 31%, 34% and 41% vs. year-ago levels in the same time frame.The Street sees Q1 profit jumping 150% to 25 cents a share and rising 25% to $2.42 for the year, then accelerating 48% to $3.59 a share in 2019.At 2 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite caught up with the 30-stock Dow, also gaining 1.5%. The small S&P 600 rallied 1.3% but is still trailing the 500 in year-to-date performance, up more than 3.3%. The 500 is up 3.9% since Jan. 1.Volume is running mildly higher vs. the same time on Thursday in both main exchanges on Wall Street.The Dow, which got scorched with a nearly 3.1% loss in the prior week, is close to recouping all of those losses. Watch to see if the blue chip index can retake its 50-day moving average.The Nasdaq remains the leading index, striking new all-time highs. At 7532, the tech, medical, banking and retail-driven index is now up 9.1% since Jan. 1.Going back to Tenaris, the stock enjoys a positive Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A- on a scale of A+ (heavy net buying by fund managers) to E (heavy net selling), as seen in IBD Stock Checkup.The Accumulation/Distribution Rating helps offset Tenaris' relatively weak EPS Rating of 79 and boosts the stock's overall Composite Rating to a very healthy 95 on a scale of 1 to 99.Keep in mind that commodity stocks can show big cyclicality in profits. Tenaris is no different.Tenaris' earnings peaked at $2.88 a share in 2012, then fell sharply over the next four years ($2.63 a share in 2013, $1.96 in 2014, a net loss of 17 cents in 2015, a net profit of 2 cents in 2016). Such a record certainly impacts a stock's EPS Rating because IBD's proprietary measure of profit growth takes into account three to five years' worth of results, not just the past few quarters.That dismal performance was likely tied to the severe drop in crude oil prices and a dismantling of exploration and production capacity in the industry. But now, WTI prices are aiming at making new multiyear highs and production is booming in North America.Tenaris saw its earnings soar to 77 cents a share in 2017. The Street sees earnings rising 42% to $1.09 a share this year, and another 45% in 2019.Revenue declined on a year-over-year basis for nine quarters in a row, through the first quarter of 2017. Yet since then, Tenaris has now grown the top line by 18%, 32% and 52% in the past three quarters. In Q4 of last year, net margin soared 760 basis points to 10.1%.Amid a strong February U.S. jobs report, institutions sold long bonds.

More than 45 million borrowers are lugging around a combined $1.45 trillion in student loan debt that they have not paid back yet, according to LendEDU.com, a marketplace for private student loans and student-loan refinancing and consolidation. Nearly 7 million federal-loan borrowers alone are in default on a total of $113.5 billion in student loans. And student loan debt is the second-largest pile of debt in the U.S., trailing only mortgages.XIf you are a graduate or proud grad's parent who wants to get rid of student-loan debt, how do you start? The stakes are high, especially for millennials. More than 34% of borrowers blame their delay in starting a family on their student debt burden. And more than 73% say it's the reason they have not started to save for retirement.Coping with that debt requires a combination of common sense and an ability to ignore debt myths, financial advisors say. Here are eight tips for attacking your student loan debt. The first three concern your broad strategy for tackling student loan debt.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIt's a question of what the best way is to use your income or assets. It makes more sense to get rid of a, say, 7% loan than continuing to pay the loan while using your money to make an investment that earns only, say, 5%, says Andrei Cherny, CEO of Aspiration, a financial advisory firm that lets customers set their own fees.If you have loans from both private lenders and the government, odds are that your private loans carry higher interest rates. ""Pay those off first,"" Matherson said.""Only a very small percentage of people qualify for student-loan forgiveness,"" Matherson said. ""You see many ads, but the vast majority are just scams. We did a study earlier this year and found that about 50% of borrowers think they qualify for forgiveness. It's just not true. It's only in the low single figures.""You can learn more about loan forgiveness at this U.S. Department of Education site.Once you've decided which loan you're going to pay off first, take certain steps to make your payment process easier and less burdensome. These five steps spell out tactics for how to proceed.Auto-pay has additional benefits. ""If you can't see the money, you won't miss it as much,"" said Doug Amis, president of Cardinal Retirement Planning, in Cary, N.C.Amis recommends starting with a small amount that you know you can afford, then ratcheting it up over time as the maximum you can afford becomes more clear or as your income rises.Some automatic payment programs work by transferring from your bank account to the loan-service provider's account, like any online bill-payment program.RELATED:How Millennials Are Building Better 401(k) Accounts Than Older WorkersSee What Amazon's First Bookstore In Los Angeles Looks Like You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

""This would be a drag on the margin, because Alibaba now owns more delivery men and inventory, but it has no choice because long-term wise, most consumption still takes place offline.""An acquisition would hand Alibaba the biggest chunk of Chinese online food delivery and pit it directly against Meituan. Ele.me — which means ""hungry yet?"" — runs an army of delivery people on motorbikes across the country that could enhance Alibaba's last-mile ability to get parcels to customers' doorsteps and complement its Koubei neighborhood services business.Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!The e-commerce giant, which owned 23% of Ele.me as of May, plans to buy the stock from existing investors including Baidu, the person said, requesting not to be named because the matter is private.

488,ADS,"Think of the cup-with-handle pattern as a launching pad that great stocks use to rocket into huge price runs. But what about the cup base that forms with no handle? Can it work as well?XBut sometimes a dynamic moneymaker is in too much of a hurry to form a handle before blasting up to new highs. Savvy investors also know how to spot a cup base that forms without a handle.A CAN SLIM-type investor always first pays tremendous attention to a company's profits, revenue, profit margins, return on equity and other metrics of growth. But don't look at fundamentals in a vacuum. When it comes to winning the stock trading game, precise timing is of the essence.So it's dangerous and actually foolish to ignore technical analysis, a fancy term for simply rolling up your sleeves and analyzing a stock's behavior via charts.If you ignore price-and-volume action, you are clearly missing out on a significant factor in what makes certain stocks great. Ignoring the ""technicals"" means you disregard the all-powerful forces of supply and demand that drive a stock's price day in, day out, and over much longer time periods.As you would expect, the cup without handle resembles a U.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe base starts to develop when a stock begins to decline after an advance of 20% or more from a prior successful breakout. If there was no prior breakout, demand that the stock has risen at least 30% from any given price before it forms a cup pattern.IBD chairman and founder Bill O'Neil says this decline often outpaces the overall market's slide. ""It's normal for growth stocks to create cup patterns during intermediate declines in the general market and to correct 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 times the market averages,"" he writes in his best-seller ""How to Make Money in Stocks.""At the same time, you want the stock to show some resilience too.O'Neil writes: ""Your best choices are generally stocks with base patterns that deteriorate the least during an intermediate market decline. Whether you're in a bull market or a bear market, stock downturns that exceed 2-1/2 times the market averages are usually too wide and loose and must be regarded with suspicion.""You want to see a drop of no more than 30% to 33%. While some cups shaped during severe bear markets can be 40%-50% deep or more and still work out, it's generally smart to focus on stocks that make shallower declines from their 52-week highs.A cup without handle must be at least six weeks long. Most are about three to six months long, and some can span a year or longer. Tight price action is preferable to wide and loose movements. In addition, there should be more up weeks in above-average volume (a sign of accumulation) than down weeks in fast trade (distribution).The buy point for a cup base is 10 cents above the high hit before the base took shape.As with all breakouts, look for the stock to clear its buy point in strong turnover, meaning trade that's at least 40% above its 50-day average.You can quickly see the 50-day average volume of any stock by either going to MarketSmith or viewing an IBD chart. Gen-Probe, an expert in diagnostic tests and blood-screening systems, went public in September 2002 and finished its debut week at around 16 a share.

490,ADS,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) will snap up Wilson Therapeutics for $855 million in a move that helps it diversify from its blockbuster franchise and compete with Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA).The acquisition of Wilson adds a ""much-needed"" late-stage asset, RBC analyst Kennen MacKay said. Alexion's biggest product, Soliris, brought in 88% of sales in 2017. Soliris treats two blood diseases and a neuromuscular condition. It's also making a follow-up drug called ALXN1210.""Investors have increasingly focused on Alexion's business development efforts to diversify revenue/value away from Soliris/ALXN1210,"" he said in a note to clients. ""As such, we anticipate this transaction could help add positive sentiment to the stock.But investors weren't as keen on the buy as MacKay had expected.

At the same time, the broader biotech group advanced 0.2%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UsePiper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond noted that Alexion shareholders are still waiting for more data on ALXN1210 before giving the stock some love. He sees ALXN1210 as a potential $500 million peak product, which would be meaningful to the biotech with $4 billion revenue.""This remains a show-me stock for now,"" he said in a report to clients. ""With most investors waiting for ALXN1210's (switch-over from Soliris) study results, we understand this name is likely to remain in a trading range until then.""The acquisition also could help Alexion compete with Valeant, which offers two highly priced treatments called Cuprimine and Syprine to treat Wilson disease. Wilson Therapeutics is targeting Wilson disease with a late-stage drug called WTX101.WTX101 answers two significant unmet needs, Piper Jaffray's Raymond said. Wilson disease occurs when excess copper builds up in tissues including the liver and brain, leading to organ damage. The condition isn't adequately treated by the current standard of care.""This would also compete with some of Valeant's more controversially priced drugs,"" he said.Price increases for Cuprimine and Syprine were ""front and center"" during the public outcry over spiking drug prices, Raymond said. He added the two drugs can cost anywhere from $8,000 to $300,000 annually.Syprine was invented decades ago. Valeant acquired it and Cuprimine in 2010. The firm gained notoriety in 2015 when it raised the price to $21,267 from $652 just five years earlier. Teva just announced it will begin offering a costly generic of Syprine.""We think this history perhaps gives Alexion some options on pricing for WTX101, as it could offer a heavy discount and still have a nicely priced product,"" he said.RBC's MacKay sees about 28,000 Wilson disease patients in the U.S. and Europe. Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges estimates 10,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe each.The current standard of care includes avoiding copper-containing foods and a therapy called copper chelation, which detoxifies a patient's blood. But there's still an unmet need in those who have advanced forms of the disease, RBC's MacKay said.""While these therapies are seen as effective, patient compliance/adherence is seen as an unmet need, which is critical toward maintaining a good long-term prognosis,"" he said.Alexion will pay the $855 million through cash on hand. The bid mostly empties the biotech's coffers, MacKay said. However, he does see the potential for the firm to make smaller deals going forward.Alexion's board unanimously approved the offer, and Wilson recommended shareholders accept it. Close to three-quarters of Wilson's shareholders have either agreed to or expressed support for the offer. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter.""The Wilson acquisition also continues to broaden Alexion's rare disease therapeutic footprint beyond its core strength in complement/hematology,"" MacKay said.Leerink's Porges sees WTX101 as a solid strategic fit for Alexion. Alexion has expertise in liver diseases. It could also parlay its commercial footprint for three approved therapies into selling WTX101, he said in a note.WTX101 is also in a stronger position than the drug Kanuma, which Alexion acquired along with Synageva BioPharma in 2015. Kanuma treats a condition known as Wolman disease, which happens when the body doesn't produce enough of a specific enzyme.Alexion struggled following its launch of Kanuma. The drug brought in $65.6 million in sales in 2017. Porges blamed Kanuma's lackluster sales for souring ""investors on Alexion's business development acumen.""He's hoping the acquisition of Wilson Therapeutics could show management's willingness to assume clinical risk for more moderate cash outlays.""Unlike the requirement with Kanuma to find and diagnose patients to drive revenue growth, Wilson disease patients are generally diagnosed and actively managed by hepatologists or neurologists, which would make initiating patients on WTX101 relatively easier,"" he said.RELATED:How To Tame A Volatile Swing Trade With A Half PositionLong-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFsNew Option Strategy Limits Risk Around Earnings

But a gain like the stock saw in the week ended April 6 — or even less — could put it past the potential buy point at 25.05.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFor its part, Weibo is rebounding after a four-week decline that took shares near the 40-week moving average. The stock met some resistance for a few days just above 125, at the underside of its 50-day moving average. The buy point is 142.22.Both stocks hold powerful EPS ratings from IBD. Fiat scores a 98. Weibo clocks in at 99. Analyst consensus projects Weibo's first-quarter year-over-year earnings growth will slow slightly, to 85%, atop a 72% revenue surge. Fiat is expected to post an 80% EPS gain, although revenue growth is forecast to slow to less than 3%. Fiat plans to announce first-quarter results April 26. Weibo has not yet announced its first-quarter reporting date.Other important gauges vary. Fiat's Accumulation/Distribution Rating — a measure that shows buying by large investors — is a healthy B+. Weibo's is a decent C+. Weibo's relative strength line is lagging below its February high. Fiat's RS line is pressing to new highs ahead of a possible breakout — an important indication of vitality.Last, but not least, is the difference in the two stocks' base counts. Weibo is forming a late stage pattern. Its last breakout (which also was late stage) failed.Fiat's base is a third-stage piece of work. That's getting  a little long in the tooth, but suggests the stock has a bit further to run from its next breakout.RELATED: Fiat Chrysler Keeps 2018 Forecast As SUV, Pickup Rollouts SetGoPro Jumps On Possible Takeover Interest From Chinese FirmNew-Car Sales: These 2 U.S. Automakers Roared In MarchBest Chinese Stocks To Buy And Watch

497,ADS,"In a volatile week for U.S.-China relations, China stocks trading on U.S. markets predictably posted mixed results.The shake-up was largely the result of the ongoing trade feud, as the Trump administration attempts to restructure the long-standing latticework of trade agreements between the two countries.The clearest pocket of strength among China stocks was in solar components makers. Daqo New Energy (DQ), JinkoSolar (JKS) and JA Solar Holdings (JASO) each posted gains of 8% or more through Friday afternoon. IBD Leaderboard stock Autohome (ATHM) and IBD 50 member Baozun (BZUN) turned in positive performances. Both comfortably maintained support as they consolidated below recent highs.At the same time, the biggest China stocks generally weakened. Baidu (BIDU), JD.com (JD) and Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) all broke down below critical levels of support. In each case, the damage will likely to take some time to repair. In addition, Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) held above its 40-week moving average, and above the prior low in its current two-month-long consolidation.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Among those, Changyou (CYOU) jumped 5%, enough to retake support at its 10-week moving average.Among new issues, IQiyi (IQ) is trading between 15.30 and 16.50 after surging when it went public March 29.The week also produced one breakout for the China stocks. Chemical giant China Petroleum & Chemical (SNP), commonly called Sinopec, broke out past an 89.78 buy point in a cup base. That aced its fifth straight weekly advance.Makers of solar panels had been an early target of U.S. tariffs. In January, the Trump Administration imposed duties of up to 30% on solar components made in China. That news initiated Daqo Solar's current basing pattern. The stock spiked the past week, rising toward a 65.10 buy point in a double-bottom base.China's markets lost ground in a week shortened by the country's Tomb Sweeping Day holiday.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseDropbox, Spotify, Bilibili and iQiyi all came public within the past month. All four have valuations above $1 billion, making them tech unicorns. The stocks have consolidated briefly, but their relative strength lines have been at or near record highs, signaling outperformance vs. the S&P 500.While all four new listings are growing strongly, they are still unprofitable. You can find profitable IPOs, including hot Brazilian payments firm PagSeguro Digital (PAGS), on the IPO Leaders stock list. The data storage provider came public at 21 a share, rising 36% to 28.47 in its March 23 debut. The stock hit a new high of 34.37 intraday on March 29. It's consolidated since then. Dropbox popped 3.5% to 32.32 on the stock market today, a new closing high.Spotify technically wasn't an IPO at all. The stock was a direct listing on April 3. The stock opened at 165.90 and hit 169 intraday before closing at 149.01. Shares fell 3.4% to 149.57 on news that top rival Apple (AAPL) Music hit 40 million subscribers.Baidu's majority-owned internet TV streaming unit priced at 18, but didn't have a great debut on March 29. Shares rose to 18.52 intraday but closed at 15.55. But after a few days, iQiyi began turning higher. The stock rose 3.8% to 18.07, a new closing high.While called the Netflix of China, iQiyi actually licenses Netflix content in China.As for Netflix, the FANG stock rose 1.9% to 303.67 on Wednesday in volume that was 29% above normal, continuing the stock's rebound from the 50-day line. That action creates a new buying opportunity, but with Netflix reporting earnings on Monday investors should be wary. Netflix is an IBD Leaderboard stock.Bilibili came public at 11.50 a share. The stock fell as low as 9.62 in its March 28 debut, closing at 11.24. Shares hit a record high of 11.80 intraday on March 29, as iQiyi debuted but reversed lower. Since then shares have consolidated in a smaller range. Bilibili dipped 0.2% to 11.48 on Wednesday.The Chinese-based online company makes most of its money from mobile games. But it's also positioning itself as a video-streaming firm like Alphabet (GOOGL)-unit YouTube, iQiyi or Netflix.IPOs are important because they offer fast-growing companies, often with new ideas and markets. But investors should avoid buying an IPO on the first few days, because of the high risk that the stock will swing wildly. Let a stock shake out and form an IPO base or other bullish pattern. IPO bases can be extremely short, but breakouts from these patterns offer investors a chance to jump into a new stock with better odds of success.IPO bases and breakouts can be wild, so be ready to cut losses quickly. Also be aware of the market environment. IPOs tend to be more volatile than the broader averages and even the typical growth stock.

506,ADS,"Guns: While viciously attacking Republicans for opposing gun control, Democrats are celebrating the victory of gun-loving Conor Lamb in the Pennsylvania special election. What would those student gun control protestors say if they knew about that?Lamb defeated his Republican opponent Rick Saccone by a handful of votes in a district that went heavily for Donald Trump. It's being heralded as a referendum on Trump and a bellwether for Democrats prospects in the fall midterm elections.What has barely been mentioned over the past few weeks, however, is the fact that Lamb ran as a something of a poster boy for the NRA.One of Lamb's campaign ads, for example, showed him firing a scary looking assault weapon while the voice over touted his Marine background and said he ""still loves to shoot.""After the Parkland school shooting, when Democratic leaders were demanding immediate action on gun bans and stoking rage against Republicans, Lamb came out and said that ""new gun laws aren't the answer to preventing more mass shootings like the one at a Florida high school.""He also came out against a proposed ban on high-capacity ammunition magazines.""I believe we have a pretty good law on the books,"" Lamb said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn effect, Lamb sided with Republicans on what should be done, namely to focus on improving the system of background checks and on mental health issues.As Vox.com put it, Lamb's pro-gun stance ""is putting the Democratic Party in a tricky position.""That's putting it mildly, given the unbelievably hostile way Democrats have described Republican positions on gun control.Rep. Nancy Pelosi has declared that someone with Lamb's views on guns is nothing more than a ""wholly-owned subsidiary of the NRA."" Sen. Charles Schumer said at one of the student protests on Wednesday anyone with Lamb's views is in ""the viselike grip of the NRA.""According to Sen. Diane Feinstein, Lamb's positions, including his opposition to banning the AR-15, aren't just misguided, they are ""dangerously wrong""Rep. Elizabeth Esty said that the focus on mental health over gun control ""shows either a fundamental lack of understanding or incredible unwillingness to face reality."" To Sen. Richard Blumenthal, it's just ""an excuse for inaction.""By late night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel's definition, Lamb is one of those ""crazies"" on guns.To liberal activist group MoveOn.org, Lamb's views on guns puts him squarely in the ""tiny group of people (who) are holding the rest of our lives hostage. The blood is on their hands.""And by Hollywood liberal director Judd Apatow's standard, Lamb's position on gun control makes him ""a dangerous idiot who is too much of a coward to reject the NRA.""Of course, none of these politicians, organizations, or celebrities will turn their flame throwers on Lamb, because, well, he's a Democrat who might help Democrats regain the House, which would then allow the party to do still more pointless posturing on gun control.Just a few days ago, Pelosi said that gun control was so important that ""I would rather pass gun safety legislation than win the election."" Right.We've got nothing against pro-gun Democrats. We wish there were more of them, and that we could then have a sensible debate on the issue.But the Democratic Party can't get away with calling Republicans blood-soaked monsters while cheering a candidate who shares the GOP's pro-gun views.

507,ADS,"A couple of relatively obscure biotechs are challenging the likes of Novartis (NVS) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) with a new form of treating cancer that not only could undercut their bigger rivals, it could render recently approved oncology drugs from those drug giants obsolete.X Novartis and Gilead are still in the early stages of launching their respective drugs called Kymriah and Yescarta, which are known as CAR-T drugs. But Cellectis (CLLS) and Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP) — each with a tiny fraction of their rivals' market cap — already are creeping in with an off-the-shelf variation on CAR-T therapy that uses healthy donor cells to create a less expensive version of these cancer drugs.This could make treatments from Novartis and Gilead ""less attractive or obsolete,"" Instinet analyst Christopher Marai told Investor's Business Daily.""Never mind pricing. (These) could be dosed more effectively,"" Marai said.CAR-T therapy is a form of oncology treatment currently created by extracting immune cells from a patient's blood. Using an ""empty"" virus, drugmakers affix what are known as chimeric antigen receptors to the immune system T cells.These receptors, also known as CARs, are proteins that can recognize other proteins used by cancer cells to hide in the body. When these re-engineered T cells are reintroduced to the body, they are directed to seek out and destroy cancer cells carrying those proteins.But the process is complex and costly. It's also tailored to individuals, meaning these drugs can't be mass produced and often take weeks to manufacture. Some patients die while they're waiting, Crispr Chief Executive Sam Kulkarni told Investor's Business Daily.His off-the-shelf approach to CAR-T is aiming to change that.Off-the-shelf CAR-T, also known as allogeneic, uses healthy donor cells to prompt the same immune response as first-generation CAR-Ts that Novartis and Gilead are using, known as autologous. Kulkarni says the donor cells are typically healthier, allowing for a more robust response in patients.The manufacturing process is less complex and, from one run, could make hundreds of doses, Kulkarni said. And because the process is uniform, it's less costly. Cellectis has estimated its cost of goods at less than $5,000 per patient. Autologous CAR-T runs into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, experts say.Kulkarni and Marai note the benefits of allogeneic CAR-T could be huge if the theory pans out in late-stage clinical testing.Healthy donor cells could also prompt a better response than using compromised T cells from a cancer patient, they say. Patients could also potentially receive repeat doses if the benefit doesn't persist from one dose. That's difficult with the much pricier autologous CAR-T.""Overall, allogeneic is so much more powerful because it's off-the-shelf,"" Kulkarni said. ""A patient can be treated the very next day. They (allogeneic CAR-Ts) have a good chance of working better than autologous CAR-Ts and they can be accessible broadly to patients.""But this theory is still a little short in the tooth. In December, Cellectis with partners Servier and Pfizer (PFE), a Dow Jones industrial average component, unveiled the results of its first clinical trial that used donor cells to create a CAR-T treatment for a form of leukemia.Brad Loncar, who runs the biotech fund known as Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF (CNCR), called the results mixed. In patients with a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the drug known as UCART19 resulted in an 83% complete remission rate across adult and pediatric patients.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

Start NowThe data weren't as strong as results from Juno Therapeutics — formally acquired by Celgene (CELG) earlier this week — when it was at that point. In Phase 1 data presented in December 2016, Juno's JCAR017, a first-generation CAR-T drug, achieved a 93% remission rate in children with the same form of leukemia.""If they had equal (effectiveness), of course the off-the-shelf CAR-T would make (first-generation CAR-T) obsolete,"" Loncar told Investor's Business Daily. ""If they have equal (effectiveness), that's a gigantic thing to say and it's far from proven. And there's reason to believe that it will never be so.""Allogeneic CAR-T could be the ""holy grail"" of oncology therapies, said Nadeem Sheikh, vice president of research and development for privately held Dendreon Pharmaceuticals. Dendreon makes an immunotherapy treatment called Provenge for advanced prostate cancer.""The entire cancer field would love something like an allogeneic approach,"" he told Investor's Business Daily. ""The allogeneic approach is: I could take your cells and give them to me. That's the holy grail. But we know there's a lot of problems with that approach.""Using a donor's cells could introduce the potential for a condition known as graft-versus-host disease, Sheikh said. With that disease, the donor immune cells don't recognize their surroundings and begin to indiscriminately attack everything that appears foreign.Crispr's Kulkarni thinks he has the answer. The company's gene editing process uses a technique called CRISPR in which a receptor on the donor's T cells is removed, preventing those cells from wildly attacking unintended targets.""Essentially, by using CRISPR we change the genetics of the healthy donor's T cells,"" he said. ""When we do that, they no longer will indiscriminately attack the patient's cells. They only attack the tumor within the patient.""By performing a second edit, the donor T cells are then engineered to appear as if they belong in the body so the patient's own immune cells won't try to destroy the donor cells, Kulkarni said. This allows the donor cells to persist longer in the body.""Think of CRISPR as like a blow torch,"" he said. ""You can actually cut metal and weld metal with it. Here, we can either add genes or remove genes from a cell. Essentially we take a healthy person's T cells and make the CAR-Ts by adding or subtracting genes.""Cellectis is in a class of its own in allogeneic CAR-T, Loncar said. Its Servier/Pfizer-partnered drug, UCART19, already has preliminary Phase 1 data. Its own drug, UCART123, is in testing in acute myeloid leukemia and a form of leukemia known as blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm.In February, Cellectis was granted a pair of U.S. patents to use CRISPR gene editing for the genetic engineering of T cells. Cellectis said it plans to make these patents available for licensing to other companies willing to use CRISPR technology in T cells.The theory is catching on quickly, even among the biggest first-generation CAR-T players. Gilead announced its acquisition of Kite in late August. The merger closed on Oct. 3 just before the FDA approved Kite's drug Yescarta on Oct. 18. Now Gilead is eyeing the allogeneic approach.Last month, Gilead partnered with Sangamo Therapeutics (SGMO) for $150 million up front to develop cellular therapies using a technique of gene editing called zinc finger nucleases. This process of gene editing is more complex and costly than the CRISPR technology used by Crispr, Editas Medicine (EDIT) and Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA).Under terms of its deal with Gilead, Sangamo is eligible for up to $3.01 billion in potential payments across 10 or more products. The two will work on autologous and allogeneic approaches to cellular therapy.Crispr, the biotech, also is working on an allogeneic CAR-T therapy called CTX101. Like Yescarta from Gilead and Kymriah from Novartis, it targets the CD19 protein, meaning it could potentially be used to treat similar blood cancers. So far, the firm has had three meetings with the FDA to discuss filing an investigational new drug application, Kulkarni said.Such an application would allow Crispr to begin a clinical trial. Kulkarni expects to file an application by the end of the year to begin clinical testing in 2019. He's bullish on Crispr's prospects, but notes it will ""take a lot of up-front time and energy.""""I think we're still in early days,"" he said. ""We have to see how the data bear out and autologous CAR-T has a head start with a number of trials. But if allogeneic starts working in one tumor type, it's a very scalable program.""RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Tame A Volatile Swing Trade With A Half PositionLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

They've taken only sparse and tentative steps to stop the spread of misinformation. This needs to change.The cause of the fake news epidemic is simple — companies prioritize profit over social responsibility. These firms' executives publicly condemn fake news. Their business models, however, dictate that any crackdowns will be little more effective than window dressing.Social media platforms are free. They generate revenue by selling ads. The more users there are, the more the platform can charge for advertising space. Facebook, for instance, has more than 2 billion users, the most of any online social network. Less than five years ago, it had just 1 billion.That growth has enabled it to hike ad prices. The cost to an advertiser per one thousand impressions for mobile ads is up 29% in just the last three months.  In the second quarter of this year, Facebook's profit hit nearly $4 billion — a 70% increase over the previous year's figure.To attract and keep users engaged, these companies need to curate entertaining and provocative content.

For example, fastfollowerz.com charges only $250 for 25,000 Twitter users to retweet a post to their own followers. Those followers can then retweet and share the post to more followers, and so on.One analyst reported that by the end of the 2016 election, fake news stories were spreading faster on Facebook than verifiable news stories published by prominent media outlets.The public's inability to distinguish between factual claims and misinformation poses a danger to our society.After news anchor Megyn Kelly clashed with then-candidate Donald Trump in August 2016, the website End the Fed falsely claimed that Fox News executives had fired Kelly for being ""a closet liberal who actually wants Hillary to win."" Facebook promoted the article in its Trending News section. The story and accusations were fake. But the avalanche of online hate and harassment was very real.Late last fall, bloggers spread a fake news article accusing Hillary Clinton of running a child sex-trafficking ring out of Comet Ping Pong, a Washington, D.C., pizza spot. A 28-year-old with an AR-15 took justice into his own hands, ""self-investigated"" the posted story, and threatened an innocent employee.Things haven't improved in the last year. In October, several tweets circulated photos of comedian Sam Hyde and incorrectly identified him as the perpetrator of the mass shooting in Las Vegas. Other purveyors of fake news claimed that the sniper was an anti-Trump Democrat and that the motive for the attack was linked to his dislike of Trump. The stories were shared thousands of times on Facebook.The social media companies that enable this chaos to continue portray themselves as champions of social responsibility. Alphabet, Google's parent company, swapped its former ""Do no evil"" motto for a new code of conduct: ""Do the right thing."" Similarly, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter co-founder Biz Stone have publicly defined their technologies as agents of social good. But their attempts to rein in fake news have been lackluster.Last November, Google announced it would stop placing ads on nonreputable sites. Yet this month, ads promoting fake news stories were featured on, of all places, the fact-checking websites PolitiFact and Snopes.This month, Facebook announced that it would include links to Wikipedia entries on publishers in its news feed in hopes of helping readers detect outlets peddling fake news. But it's unrealistic to think that users will do background research on each and every publication they encounter.These tech giants are far from struggling startups. They are some of the most profitable companies in the world and have become integral to the very fabric our lives. Given their vast influence, privileged positions and near-bottomless resources, they have an obligation to create a viable, cohesive strategy that stems the dissemination of false information.

532,ADS,"Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) surged early Thursday after announcing it would slash its workforce by more than a quarter, close several manufacturing facilities and suspend its dividends on ordinary shares.X Teva expects to eliminate a total of 14,000 positions worldwide, more than 25% of its workforce, over the next two years. The majority of the reductions are expected to occur in 2018. Most of the affected employees will be notified within the next 90 days.The restructuring plan comes as Teva struggles to pay back $34.7 billion in debt. According to sources cited by Bloomberg earlier this week, Teva is reportedly working with advisory firm Evercore to review its options related to its debt.""These are decisions I don't take lightly but they are necessary to secure Teva's future,"" Chief Executive Kare Schultz said in a prepared statement. Schultz took over at Teva in November.""We will implement these changes with fairness and the utmost respect to our colleagues worldwide,"" Schultz went on to say.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Teva had leapt 10.2% to close at 17.30. During premarket action, it rocketed more than 17%.Under the restructuring plan, Teva expects to cut its total cost base by $3 billion by the end of 2019. This follows an announcement last month that it would combine its generic and specialty drug units and focus solely on the U.S., Europe and emerging markets.More than half of the plan is expected to be achieved by the end of 2018. Teva expects to pay a restructuring charge of at least $700 million, mainly related to severance costs with additional potential charges tied to closures or divestments of plants, facilities, headquarters and offices.IBD'S TAKE: Teva has a poor Relative Strength Rating of 3 out of a best-possible 99, meaning the stock's price performance has lagged over the last 12 months. Better stocks tend to have an RS Rating of 80 or above. Head to IBD's Research page for more on how to spot winning stocks.The drugmaker plans to close or divest a ""significant number"" of research and development facilities, headquarters and other office locations across the globe. It will review its research programs to prioritize core projects and terminate others to keep a substantial pipeline.Teva also plans to strengthen its generic unit by adjusting prices or discontinuing products. This will allow it to close or divest a number of manufacturing plants in the U.S., Europe, Israel and growth markets.The company will also suspend dividends on ordinary shares and American depository shares. Teva's annual bonus will not be paid in 2017 ""due to the fact that the company's financial results are significantly below our original guidance for the year,"" the firm said in a news release.Teva expects to provide full guidance for 2018 in February and will update its longer-term strategic plan later in 2018.RELATED:Teva's Restructuring Plan: Another Case Of Been Here, Done That?Teva Survives Price Cut As Billionaire Reportedly Mulls StakeGeneric Drug Makers Face Pricing Issues That Other Pharmas Don't

533,ADS,"The $1.7 billion Columbia Large Cap Growth Fund III (NFEAX) is way ahead of the broad market as measured by the S&P 500 this year, and that's a nice change from last year. The rebound has a lot to do with the rally by growth stocks vs. value stocks in general, especially technology sector names like Alibaba Group (BABA) and Facebook (FB), says lead manager John Wilson.X Those two holdings are up 101% and 55%, respectively, this year. ""Technology this year is anchored by strong performances in internet stocks and semiconductor names and infrastructure (internet platform) software names,"" Wilson said.The shift has helped the fund. In 2016 the fund edged up 1.26% while the bogey advanced 11.96%. This year going into Wednesday the fund was up 27.58% vs. a 21.30% gain for the S&P 500 and a 26.97% gain by the fund's large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc.The fund appears poised to keep riding that wave. Its largest sector as of Oct. 31 was technology, with a 34% weighting. That was more than double its next biggest weighting, which was 15.37% in consumer cyclical stocks. Health care stocks were less than one percentage point behind.In tech stocks, Wilson and co-managers Peter Deininger and Tchintcia Barros are playing several themes. One is a switch by technology consumers. ""They are starting to re-architect the different applications they use and software platforms they use,"" Deininger said. ""That benefits some individual software companies like Salesforce.com (CRM) and ServiceNow (NOW).""Another theme involves the companies that create and supply the internet infrastructure — including the cloud — that firms like Salesforce and ServiceNow use to provide their services. ""Nvidia (NVDA) helps power some of the computer processing in next-generation data centers,"" Deininger said. ""It also helps drive business for more mundane suppliers, whether they are Micron Technology (MU), supplying underlying memory architecture, or Lam Research (LRCX), providing capital equipment that drives expansion that we see in the semiconductor industry overall.""Micron makes several types of computer chips, including dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) and flash memory (NAND), which are increasingly important in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and augmented- and virtual-reality applications on Apple (AAPL) iPhones and other high-end smartphones, Deininger says.Lam is a semiconductor capital equipment manufacturer. It benefits not only from robust demand for memory chips and a rotation away from old disk drives to solid-state flash-driven drives. It also benefits from the shift to multilayered computer chips and the increasing capital intensity of manufacturing with advanced technologies, Deininger says.After Alibaba's big share-price gain this year, the fund has moderately trimmed its share count in recent disclosures. ""These were modest position trims given the stock's strong performance this year,"" Wilson said. ""It had elevated to the point where we took a modest percentage off the table. It reflects the stock's strong price performance and the fact that its relative weighting had increased a lot, so we made trims to bring the relative risk-return down.""Wilson and his colleagues still like Alibaba because ""it's done a good job of monetizing their mobile user base,"" he said. ""There was some concern when they went public (about three years ago) that that would be a slow process. But they've done a good job of improving the relevance of their ecosystem to the Chinese consumer. And they've done an excellent job of tying in their retail network as a marketplace for them to sell a broad variety of goods and services.""He adds that Alibaba has done a good job of developing their infrastructure business like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud.The fund has made moderate trims to its share count in Facebook for similar reasons. The fund still likes the stock. ""Our view is that the company has a tremendously strong global franchise,"" he said. ""They're increasingly effective at monetizing, especially in their core Facebook platform. And they've done a tremendous job of ramping up their Instagram platform, which is smaller but growing quickly.""He added, ""There are six million advertisers in Facebook and only two million on Instagram. But it is fair to say Instagram will get to six million, so it has a lot of runway."" User growth will spur advertiser growth, which will fuel Instagram's pricing power, Wilson says.In addition, he expects the firm to monetize Messenger and WhatsApp. ""They have some additional opportunities that are interesting, but not totally clear,"" he said.As for Facebook's spending, Wilson is not worried. ""Clearly they are spending aggressively to address issues of newsfeed-quality issues,"" Wilson said. ""They're addressing those issues head-on and it is relatively well understood by the marketplace at this time.""Health care may be the fund's third-largest sector, but it is the fund's biggest overweight vs. the Russell 1000 Growth Index. The fund managers like some biotechnology stocks that offer ""new revenue streams driven by new products that are perhaps not well understood by the market,"" he said.Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) is one. The company's lead drug, Soliris, has been used to treat blood disorders. The company now has approval to begin selling Soliris for treatment of myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune neuromuscular disease. But the stock, trading around 113, is 24% off its 51-week high of 149.34 set Sept. 5 and attempting a rally from its Dec. 7 low of 105.01.RELATED:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

545,ADS,"Stocks were higher at midday Wednesday but gave back some gains, as the market tried to find its footing following Tuesday's broad slide.X The Dow Jones industrial average led with a 0.4% increase, a leap that came largely thanks to Boeing's (BA) 5% rally to an all-time high. Boeing today beat earnings expectations and gave an upbeat forecast on profit and revenue for the coming year.The S&P 500 was up 0.1% after being up as much as 0.6% in today's market. The Nasdaq also climbed around 0.1% as it also faded from early gains. The main indexes recovered only a fraction of Tuesday's sharp losses and were near session lows. As IBD's signature market analysis column, The Big Picture, has noted, the market has seemed frothy and a larger pullback would not be surprising.Volume was lower compared with the same time Tuesday. Breadth was mixed, with advancers over decliners by 6-to-5 on the NYSE but losers ahead on the Nasdaq by the same ratio.The small-cap Russell 2000 reversed lower and was down a fraction. The Dow transports, however, rose 0.6% as airline and trucking stocks were among the morning's top performers.Brazil-based airline Azul (AZUL) broke out of a cup-without-handle base, gapping past a 29.53 buy point. But volume was unimpressive.A few other breakouts also were fading, including insurer Chubb (CB) (which tried to top a 156.10 buy point) and chip company Aquantia (AQ) (13.90 entry). Chubb missed earnings estimates late Tuesday. Aquantia went public on Nov. 3 and is thinly traded with an average daily turnover of 224,000 shares.Internet retail also was one of the day's winners, as Amazon.com (AMZN) rose to a new high and extended a scorching advance.The stock has risen more than 20% from its 1,213.51 buy point, an increase that justifies taking profits. Amazon.com reports earnings Thursday after the close, and shareholders have the opportunity to lock in gains and sit out the earnings announcement, and thus the risk that comes with any quarterly report.Amazon has been a member of IBD Leaderboard since March 29, 2017.Homebuilders were bouncing back and were one of the 10 best industry groups this morning. D.R. Horton (DHI) beat earnings expectations Wednesday. But the stock met resistance at the 50-day moving average and erased most of its early gains. It was a disappointing move that failed to remove worries about the industry's ability to remain a market leader.Energy, recreational vehicle, steel and some retail industry groups were the weakest. U.S. crude prices fell 0.3% to $64.27 a barrel. Officials reported a surprisingly large build in domestic crude inventories while oil production increased again.The Innovator IBD 50 Fund (FFTY), an ETF that tracks the IBD 50 index, was only slightly higher but still endeavoring to rise from support at the key 50-day moving average.RELATED:Boeing Beats Q4 Earnings Forecast, Gives Strong GuidanceHomebuilder Giant D.R.

546,ADS,"Stocks reversed lower after the Fed's comments, but closed out the session with modest gains. Boeing (BA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) boosted the Dow Jones industrial average.X SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) rose 0.3%, PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) advanced 0.4% and SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) added 0.1% in the stock market today. Emerging markets outperformed with iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM) up 0.5%. Small caps lagged: iShares Core S&P Small-Cap (IJR) and iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) fell 0.5% each.The Fed held rates steady, but slightly more hawkish comments regarding inflation spooked the market.Boeing led the Dow with a 5% gain after topping Q4 views and offering bullish guidance. Also on the Dow, Microsoft rose nearly 2%, on track for a new closing high. Apple recovered 0.3%. The iPhone maker reports on Thursday.REITs, utilities and semiconductors led the upside among sector funds. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH), featured in Monday's ETF column, advanced 0.8% to retake a 105.93 buy point. Graphics chip designer Nvidia (NVDA) rose 2% to a new record high.Biotech, health care and building plays were lower. Oil funds were mixed as West Texas intermediate crude prices rose 0.5% to %64.82 a barrel. Gold funds climbed as did underlying gold futures.But Bitcoin edged 0.4% higher to $10,073.52, according to CoinDesk. It had earlier climbed back above the $10,300 level. A South Korean official said the country doesn't plan to ban but will regulate cryptocurrency exchanges, according to Reuters. Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), however, slumped 12%. It's now 61% off its mid-December peak.Stocks got smacked across the board Tuesday. But on the plus side, that may help set up new buy opportunities in equity ETFs holding top stocks like AI player Nvidia and Alibaba (BABA).Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) gapped down and fell more than 3% early Tuesday, but found support at its 50-day moving average and pared its loss by the close. If it continues to bounce off the support line, that could mark a chance to buy shares. An early January rebound off the 50-day yielded an 8% advance through a Jan. 22 intraday high. A late August pullback and bounce off the line produced a near 23% gain through a Nov. 22 intraday high.The fund, which launched in April 2015 as a partnership between IBD and Innovator Capital Management, has attracted $376.8 million in assets. It tracks the IBD 50 Index, which comprises the top 50 growth stocks selected by IBD.

Smaller positions in industrials, energy, consumer staples and materials made up the rest. The U.S. represented the biggest country weighting, 81%, followed by China at 14%, Australia 3% and Argentina 2%.IBD'S  TAKE: Nvidia is a leading chip stock, but how do the company's fundamentals rank in its industry group?

Arista and Align fell sharply in early trading and closed near the top of their session range.Align Technology fell before the opening bell on the stock market today despite reporting better-than-expected earnings late Tuesday.So far this year, FFTY lags the S&P 500 with a 4.1% to 6.2% return. The ETF's one-year return of 40% leads the broader index's 26.9% gain. FFTY carries a 0.80% expense ratio.

547,ADS,"Investors hoping that esports will be a near-term driver of sales and earnings for the major video game publishers are going to be disappointed, a Wall Street analyst said Tuesday.""Over the long run, we believe that esports will be a meaningful new revenue stream for the video game industry,"" Cowen analyst Doug Creutz said in a note to clients. ""However, we expect progress to remain somewhat slow, probably frustratingly so, for any investors basing nearer-term investment theses on esports growth.""Esports involves playing video games competitively for cash prizes in front of audiences, both in person and online. Esports has seen tremendous growth in popularity over the last few years and publishers Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Electronic Arts (EA) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) are angling for a piece of the pie.But there are likely to be few major winners in esports, Creutz said.""We expect that professional esports will come to be dominated by a relatively small number of successful titles (six to eight on a global basis), similar to traditional sports,"" Creutz said.Currently three games dominate the esports scene: Tencent's (TCEHY) ""League of Legends"" and Valve's ""Dota 2"" and ""Counter-Strike: Global Offensive."" Those three games accounted for over 60% of total esports prize money in 2017 and well over half of total esports viewership, Creutz said.""While we think this leaves room for other successful professional esports franchises, the window is not enormously wide,"" he said.Activision is best positioned to break into that group of esports leaders, because it already has esports titles in ""Overwatch,"" ""Hearthstone,"" ""StarCraft"" and ""Heroes of the Storm,"" Creutz said.Earlier this month, Activision officially launched its Overwatch League, which features city-based teams competing in the science-fiction shooter game ""Overwatch."" It's off to a ""respectable start,"" but will need to grow its audience to become a meaningful contributor to Activision's financials, Creutz said.Activision shares fell 1.2% to close at 71.61 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Activision stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 88, meaning it has outperformed 88% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more analysis on Activision and its publicly traded peers, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Media rights and advertising revenue are keys to making esports a growth driver for publishers, he said.High-water marks in media rights so far are Walt Disney (DIS)-owned BamTech Media paying $300 million for a seven-year deal to stream ""League of Legends"" tournaments and Amazon (AMZN)-owned Twitch paying a reported $90 million for a two-year deal to stream the Overwatch League.""Neither (deal) is terribly material to their respective company's bottom lines (we estimate the Overwatch League deal is worth about 2 cents EPS to Activision),"" Creutz said.Electronic Arts is pushing its FIFA, Madden and Battlefield franchises as esports contenders, while Take-Two is touting NBA 2K as an esport. But those games need to develop esports interest and infrastructure to be successful, Creutz said.By contrast, the top esports games, such as ""League of Legends"" and ""CS:GO,"" developed organically with players and organizations creating tournaments and building audiences online.""While we are relatively bullish on the long-term future of esports, we think its contributions over the next two to three years (at least) are likely to remain small and not terribly incremental to existing business models,"" Creutz said.RELATED:Take-Two Seen Getting Boost From 'Doomsday Heist'Can Esports' Armchair Gladiators Vanquish Hulking NFL Players?

Shares are recapturing their 54.06 cup-shaped base buy point, just one day after giving up that entry. The 5% buy range topped out at 56.76, so shares quickly became extended. Driving the company's profit outlook is the stunning success of the Nintendo Switch console, which is a hybrid console that allows users to play on their TV and then pick up the device and play on the go.Video game maker Electronic Arts was breaking out of a cup-shaped base with a 122.89 buy point. Shares are just out of buy range.

Notably, acquiring the rare disease biotech would strengthen Takeda's offerings in oncology, gastrointestinal and neuroscience, the firm said. It would also help Takeda delve deeper into the U.S. market.The potential offer comes as rival Genentech, a subsidiary of Roche (RHHBY), reports additional deaths in patients taking hemophilia drug Hemlibra. Hemlibra competes against Shire's drug Feiba. In total, five patients taking Hemlibra have died, Miehm said.None of the deaths are related to Hemlibra, Roche has said.

Patients treated with Tesaro's Zejula are cautioned about blood toxicity and cardiovascular effects, he said.Rubraca is the cleanest and safest drug in its class, RBC analyst Kennen MacKay said in a note to clients.""We see these dynamics driving Rubraca's competitive positioning in the recurrent maintenance market despite being third to market behind AstraZeneca and Tesaro,"" he said.Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond kept his neutral rating on Tesaro stock in his report to clients.""Competition and lack of differentiation in the PARP inhibitor space has long been one of our primary concerns for Tesaro's Zejula,"" he said. ""The approval of a third PARP inhibitor for maintenance in recurrent ovarian cancer does little to quell our concerns.""Like RBC's MacKay, Raymond expects the PARP inhibitors to be differentiated on their safety. This ""does not favor Zejula."" The announcement underscores the competitive pressure intensifying in the space, he said.""The similarities among the three PARP inhibitors continue to grow,"" Raymond said.

566,ADS,"When the stock market indicates a new uptrend is underway, many individual investors who want to trade growth stocks and make money ironically remain skeptical.A bullish follow-through signal comes after a mostly negative period in the market, so the negative reaction is natural.The reaction may be natural but, to be blunt, it's not too smart. The investor is heeding the recent past while ignoring a signal that says present conditions have changed.What is a follow-through day? It's a bottoming signal that occurs when a major index surges in higher volume than the previous day, and at least four days from an index low.The prudent investor will make an effort to buy something on a follow-through day. The stock should be highly rated and breaking out in strong volume.What if there aren't any stocks breaking out on the follow-through? That happens, and it justifies caution.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhat if the stocks breaking out are stocks the investor has never heard of? That too happens, but it only means the investor hasn't been doing his or her homework.Rallies are often made of stocks that nobody but professional fund managers and devoted IBD readers have heard about.Here are several stocks that broke out on a follow-through day in recent years and the size of the gains that followed. The condition of the relative strength line, which points to outperformance vs. the S&P 500, is also noted. See the RS line painted in blue in every daily and weekly chart at Investors.com.March 1, 2010: SanDisk broke out in volume 89% above average. The RS line was at a 52-week high. The stock  rose 57% in three months. (Western Digital (WDC) acquired SanDisk in May 2016.)On the same follow-through, Power Integrations (POWI) broke out in volume 237% above average. The RS line was also at a new high. The stock gained 24% in about six weeks.Sept. 1, 2010: Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) broke out of a solid 10-week cup with handle that featured a 154.53 buy point (1)  in 124% faster turnover than usual.The accompanying weekly chart clearly shows that volume during the breakout week surged vs. the prior week, a sign of superb institutional demand. Notice how turnover was also the highest in six weeks.The RS line was at a new high. You can see historical relative strength lines and earlier charts via MarketSmith, IBD's premium stock charting and screening service. Some of the charts go back decades in time.The stock rose 70% in three months before peaking at 262.77 and dipping beneath its 10-week moving average (2) to begin a new base.June 21, 2011: Lululemon Athletica (LULU) broke out in volume 61% heavier than usual. The RS line was at a new high. Lulu advanced 25% in one month.Lululemon, a leader in premium-priced athletic apparel, is a current member of IBD Leaderboard.June 29, 2012: Anheuser Busch InBev (BUD) broke out in volume 200% above the 50-day average. The RS line was at a new high. The parent of Budweiser rose 21% in about three months.July 26, 2012: Cabela's (CAB) retook a lost buy point in volume 271% above average. The RS line was at a new high. Cabela's posted a 41% gain in a little more than two months.Oct. 21, 2014: Snap On (SNA) broke out in volume 49% above average. The RS line was at a new high. Snap On advanced 34% in 10 months.May 14, 2015: Criteo (CRTO) broke out in volume 197% quicker than normal. The RS line was at a new high. The stock gained 22% in about two months.The point here isn't that investors should fill up the portfolio with new buys on the follow-through day. Instead, an investor should buy one or two stocks and see if they continue to act well. Avoid the extremes of either jumping in too aggressively or refusing to test the waters at all.And keep track of the relative strength line. It's an important indicator of strength.(A version of this column was originally published on Sept. 4, 2017.

Facebook announced a ban on cryptocurrency ads this week.Bitcoin declined as much as 12% today to $8,796, the lowest since November, in part on concern that India may crack down on cryptocurrencies.

""We're still correcting as the rally had gone too far.""Bitcoin's dizzying 1,400% ascent last year, which created $200 billion in new wealth for investors, has made its 30% fall in January all the more painful. The $44.2 billion in market value lost last month is by far a record for the digital currency, whose entire market cap hadn't come close to that amount until 2017, according to price data from Coinmarketcap.com.India's Finance Minister Arun Jaitley told lawmakers in New Delhi on Thursday that the country doesn't consider cryptocurrencies legal tender ""and will take all measures to eliminate use of these crypto-assets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payment system,"" while it will explore the use of blockchain technology.While major U.S. exchanges launched Bitcoin futures contracts in December, there has been a pushback elsewhere.

587,ADS,"Grocery giant Kroger (KR) and China e-commerce heavyweight Alibaba (BABA) have recently chatted about potentially working together, according to multiple reports. The talks are happening as stores continue to eye Amazon's (AMZN) moves in the food space following its multibillion-dollar acquisition of Whole Foods Markets last year and its debut this week of cashier-less convenience-store concept Amazon Go.X The discussions were in the early stage, said Reuters, and will not necessarily result in a deal. According to the New York Post, which first reported the news, senior execs on both sides met in China last month. Alibaba has reportedly been expanding the store count of its Hema supermarkets in the country.The Kroger-Alibaba news follows last week's report that Kroger was mulling a bid to acquire online home goods seller Overstock (OSTK), which would bolster its e-commerce operations and expand its presence in the home-furnishings market.Kroger, which operates 2,790 stores under the Food4less, Fred Meyer, Harris Teeter and Ralphs names among others, is also said to be in advanced talks to acquire Boxed.com, a wholesale e-tailer that has earned the moniker ""Costco for millennials.""Despite Amazon's smaller presence on the grocery front — there are fewer than 500 Whole Foods stores and only one Amazon Go — Wall Street is keenly aware of the online retailer's disruptive potential. After the takeover, Amazon was quick to cut prices at the upscale grocery store, offer Whole Foods products on Amazon.com and install Echo displays in Whole Foods stores.Kroger shares closed up 2.65% at 30.26 in the stock market today, finally retaking the 30 price level for the first time since Amazon first made its bombshell acquisition announcement last June. Alibaba rallied 1.4%, and Amazon added 1.5%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Kroger isn't the only chain scrambling to build a greater digital defense in this e-commerce age. Target (TGT) announced Thursday that, in tandem with newly acquired online grocery marketplace Shipt, it would roll out same-day delivery in Florida.And as Investor's Business Daily reported last week, Wal-Mart (WMT) has trademarked ""Wam! by Walmart,"" which relates to ""retail and online grocery store services featuring home delivery service.""A Wal-Mart spokesperson said the company did not have further details to share on that trademark at the moment, but is ""always thinking about new concepts and ways that will help us best serve customers now and in the future.""Target shares finished down 0.8%, and Wal-Mart edged up 0.8%.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Amazon Raises Monthly Fee On Prime Membership Program 18%Here's Why Wal-Mart Is 'Still Very Much In Control Of Its Own Destiny'Here Are Your 20 Cities Vying For Amazon's New Headquarters

Nomura-Instinet analyst Andrew Orchard wrote in October that a big summer-season course promotion dented margins more than expected, but that the rest of the year looked solid.Separately, Sunlands.com, a Beijing-based education firm backed by New Oriental, is planning a U.S. IPO, Bloomberg reported, citing sources.

Apple could guide to 51 million to 57 million iPhone unit sales for the current quarter, he said.""Our analysis points to a sequential decline in iPhone units of 33%, which is only modestly higher than the (roughly) 30% decline Apple has seen in each of the last two years from December to March,"" Sacconaghi said. Bernstein rates Apple stock as outperform with a price target of 195.Apple shares fell 1.6% to close at 174.22 on the stock market today.

597,ADS,"Solar energy stocks fluctuated Tuesday, following a decision by President Donald Trump to slap tariffs on all imported solar panels, a ruling that targeted China.X The ruling was beneficial for First Solar (FSLR), the largest U.S. manufacturer of solar panels, and Tesla (TSLA), which entered the solar business with its $2.6 billion acquisition of Solar City, completed in November.In a decision announced after the market close Monday, President Donald Trump agreed to impose tariffs of 30% on imported solar panel technology, with a four-year gradual reduction to 15%. The move is an attempt to protect domestic manufacturers of the technology while taking a more aggressive approach toward China. The tariffs apply to all imported photovoltaic cells and modules, which are the core elements of solar panels.First Solar is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the ruling. Although First Solar also makes some of its panels offshore, it is not a target of the ruling. That's because its panels use a different solar technology that is exempt. In December, Baird analyst Ben Kallo raised First Solar to outperform from neutral, saying First Solar is his top pick. First Solar beat the consensus estimate when it reported first-quarter earnings.First Solar shares initially jumped 8%, but reversed and ended the regular trading session down 0.7% to 68.48 on the stock market today. First Solar shares have doubled in the past year.Tesla benefited from the ruling as some of the solar equipment it imports may prove to be tariff-free. Tesla recently opened one of its so-called gigafactories in Buffalo, New York, along with Panasonic. It began producing solar roof tiles in December.""Tesla is committed to expanding its domestic manufacturing, including Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo, New York, regardless of the solar tariff decision,"" Tesla said in a statement. Tesla shares were up 0.5% near 353 in recent action.IBD'S TAKE: After a 54% advance in 2017, the Energy-Solar group holds a No. 24 ranking among the 197 industries tracked by IBD. IBD research has shown that as much as 37% of a leading stock's price movement is directly tied to the strength of the stock's industry group at the time of breakout.Among China solar stocks, Daqo New Energy (DQ) lost 1.1% to close at 62.55. Daqo is in the notoriously cyclical business of making polysilicon material used to make photovoltaic cells.The Trump decision follows a U.S. International Trade Commission study regarding low-cost solar panels from China being dumped in the U.S. at below-market costs. The investigation resulted from a complaint by solar panel manufacturer Suniva which operated in the U.S, and in April 2017 declared bankruptcy and petitioned the International Trade Commission, claiming it could not compete with cheap solar cells imported from China.Among other U.S. solar stocks, SunPower (SPWR) plunged 6.4% to close at 8.16. San Jose, Calif.-based SunPower designs and manufactures solar panels and systems for residential, business, government and utility customers.

""It is coming very strongly and will affect behaviors, decisions, and strategies of established producers but others as well. It will affect everybody. In a shale revolution world, no country is an island.""While Birol avoided directly saying what OPEC must do, the warning from the oil watchdog is particularly ominous for the oil group, which may be forced to continue holding back its own production to prevent prices from collapsing again, as they did in 2014.OPEC and nonmembers like Russia plan to wind down their agreement to curb production by 1.8 million barrels a day. The production limits are set to expire by the end of the year and have helped ease the global glut of oil supplies and propped crude prices back up.But the price rebound has also encouraged U.S. shale companies to pump more oil, and total U.S. production has topped 10 million barrels a day and toppled a near-half-century record in November.The price of U.S. crude rose 2.2% to settle at $62.57 a barrel amid reports that a pipeline outage in Libya has forced the country's biggest oilfield to halt pumping.

The picture only worsens in 2020 with significant debt maturing, he said.""Though it is not lost on us that Valeant has a brisk pace of new/upcoming launches, we believe that Valeant's aspirational target for doubling U.S. dermatology sales by 2022 vs. 2017 is overly optimistic,"" he said.Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler deemed Valeant's outlook ""optimistic"" for a 5%-8% compound annual growth rate in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and appreciation from 2018-21.Valeant shares collapsed 11.4% Wednesday following the company's fourth-quarter report and were still in free fall on Thursday. On the stock market today, Valeant toppled another 6.9% to close at 15.26, after diving as much as 7.5% in earlier trades.Valeant is bullish on a combination of the drugs retinoid tazarotene and halobetasol called Duobrii for plaque psoriasis. But generics of tazarotene, like Allergan's (AGN) Tazorac, are now available, though higher-concentration versions of halobetasol are not widely available.""There are a number of other higher-concentration topical steroids that are generically available,"" he said. ""Put another way, Duobrii might be efficacious and well-tolerated, but there are economic/payer realities to consider.""Over the next five years, Valeant expects its ""significant seven"" drugs to grow to north of $1 billion from around $100 million. Among those, Valeant counts therapies for psoriasis, opioid-induced constipation and glaucoma.But it will have to square off vs. Allergan in psoriasis, AstraZeneca (AZN) and Purdue Pharmaceuticals in opioid-induced constipation, and Aerie Pharmaceuticals (AERI) in glaucoma, Amsellem said. He cut his price target to 10 from 12.RELATED:How To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersSell And Take Profits Or Hold?

623,ADS,"Tesaro (TSRO) crashed to a two-year low Wednesday after its biggest moneymaker fell short in the fourth quarter and the biotech said it would suspend distribution of another drug.X Sales of Zejula, an ovarian cancer drug, came in at $43.4 million, below the consensus for about $46 million, according to several analyst reports. Zejula competes with AstraZeneca's (AZN) Lynparza and Clovis Oncology's (CLVS) Rubraca.That puts Tesaro's guidance for $255 million to $275 million in 2018 sales of Zejula in doubt, Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond said in a note to clients. Raymond predicts just $250 million in full-year sales of the drug, known as a PARP inhibitor.""We continue to think increasing interchangeability of marketed PARP inhibitors on the (effectiveness) front and what may also be a safety disadvantage for Zejula could serve as a drag on this guidance,"" he said.On the stock market today, Tesaro plunged 10.3% to close at 55.23, after earlier losing as much as 15.2%. Shares hit their lowest point since July 2016. AstraZeneca sank 1.9% to finish at 33.19. Clovis lost 1.8% to 58.07.RBC analyst Kennen MacKay also ""dramatically cut"" his views of Zejula to $228 million for 2018. Tesaro's outlook is challenging as it requires 17%-29% sequential growth each period from the second quarter through the fourth based on first-quarter guidance, he said in a note.""Our updated 2018 Zejula estimates of $228 million are well below guidance of $255 million to $275 million as we anticipate emerging competition could add additional competitive headwinds to Zejula,"" he said.In addition, Tesaro said it would suspend distribution of the intravenous formula for Varubi, a treatment for nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, due to post-marketing cases of allergic reaction and hypersensitivity.Analysts were surprised by the decision. Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young, following a follow-up conversation with Tesaro, said the problem is likely due to a type of emulsifier used in Varubi rather than the drug itself.""However, to circumvent this problem, the company would need to do additional trials with a different formulation and at this point the company would prefer to focus its resources on Zejula development,"" she said in a report.Young removed expectations for $150 million in Varubi IV sales in 2025 from her model. Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez, similarly, had only modeled $150 million in peak 2026 sales of Varubi IV. He also eliminated it from his model in 2019 and beyond.""Overall, we think that this makes sense, though we view this update as a surprise,"" Credit Suisse's Young said.RELATED:Veeva Rockets After Topping Quarterly Estimates, Crushing Guidance ViewsHow Celgene 'Gambled' On Ozanimod — And Why It Didn't Pay OffCelgene Tanks After FDA Refuses To Review Multiple Sclerosis Drug

Shares have lost more than a quarter of their value since the beginning of the year as Tesaro's biggest drug faces challenges from AstraZeneca (AZN) and Clovis Oncology (CLVS).Zejula belongs to a class called PARP inhibitors, which treat ovarian cancer in some patients. During the fourth quarter, Zejula brought in $43.4 million in sales, missing expectations for $46 million, Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond said in a note to clients.""Recall at the end of last year, there was a one-week lag between the announcement and effective date of a Zejula price increase, which could have resulted in an inventory build,"" he said.

AstraZeneca, though, lifted a fraction to 35.42.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe regimen failed to improve progression-free survival in melanoma patients, and looked unlikely to have an impact on overall survival, Incyte said in a news release. The combination tested epacadostat, which inhibits the IDO1 enzyme, with Merck's Keytruda, a PD-1 protein inhibitor.Data from the study will help contribute to the overall understanding of IDO1 inhibition in combination with a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, Incyte Chief Medical Officer Steven Stein said.""We remain dedicated to transforming the treatment of cancer and will continue to explore how IDO1 inhibition and other novel mechanisms can potentially improve outcomes for patients in need,"" he said in a written statement.Safety from the combination was in line with previous studies, Incyte said. Patients will move off the regimen ""in a manner consistent with the best interests of each patient.""Incyte is also testing epacadostat in lung cancer patients in combinations with Merck, Bristol and AstraZeneca. Investigators are also looking at epacadostat regimens in kidney, head-and-neck and bladder cancers.Analysts had been bullish on Incyte's chances with epacadostat. Broadly, they theorize that combining immuno-oncology drugs could offer a more potent cancer response.Bristol has been at the forefront of combining immuno-oncology drugs. Its Opdivo, another PD-1 inhibitor, and Yervoy, which is known as a CTLA-4 inhibitor, are approved to treat melanoma. Bristol is also testing the regimen in other cancers.Merck, on the other hand, has worked to combine Keytruda with chemotherapy. U.S. regulators approved the combination as a first treatment for advanced lung cancer. Merck is also studying Keytruda with another investigational PD-1 inhibitor called MK-3475.On Friday, analysts were less bullish on Incyte's shot with epacadostat, but do see some value for Incyte's other drugs including baricitinib, a rheumatoid arthritis drug with Eli Lilly (LLY), and cancer drug ruxolitinib, branded as Jakafi and Jakavi.Raymond James' Benjamin kept his outperform rating on Incyte. He sees Incyte's Jakafi generating $2.5 billion to $3 billion by 2027. It also has the potential to book significant royalties from baricitinib as well as ruxolitinib outside the U.S., which is also sold by Novartis (NVS) as Jakavi.RBC analyst Brian Abrahams chopped his price target on Incyte to 75 from 114, completely discounting epacadostat. He still has an outperform rating on the stock. Like Raymond James' Benjamin, he still sees some value for Jakafi and baricitinib. But he expects Incyte to terminate other epacadostat studies.""Only silver lining in our view is that (the) results were unequivocal and should make future decisions clear,"" he said in a note.

Concentration. No. 3? A full understanding and conviction in IBD's seven-point investment system, CAN SLIM.Discipline means focusing your cash in the very best stocks, the ones that rise a lot and rise fast. These market lions enjoy long-term buying from institutions. IBD calls this accumulation.The big boys and the big girls move stock prices on Wall Street. Mutual fund companies, large hedge funds and registered investment advisors with hundreds of millions, even billions to invest, seem to have the advantage. Yet an individual investor can still make money. Follow the CAN SLIM system, invented by IBD chairman and founder Bill O'Neil, of selecting, buying and selling stocks, to a T.Note that the I in this seven-letter acronym stands for institutional sponsorship and strong demand. Avoid the penny stocks with bombastic promises from its promoters. Smart fund managers don't buy junk. Seek the high-quality names that the best funds are buying, and you boost your chances of making money.Harness the power of growth stock screens such as the IBD 50, Sector Leaders, IPO Leaders, Global Leaders or Big Cap 20. None of the companies trade below $10 a share. A high price is a badge of quality; a high share price also allows funds to deploy a lot of capital more quickly.Don't let a share price of $50, $100 or more stop you from seeking shares in the best quality companies at the right time. The number of shares you buy does not matter. And this is where the second ingredient — concentration — comes in. An investor with up to $5,000 to invest should really invest only in one or two names at a time.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Eight to 10 stocks makes sense in an account of say, $200,000, $500,000 or more, and when the market is in a strong uptrend.By owning just one or two stocks, you must cut losses short, at 7% or less. We call this the golden rule of investing.Doing so keeps you in the Wall Street game. Several winners that rise 20%, 40%, 100% or more will more than offset the bad trades.Let's say you opened a $2,500 account at the start of 2017.

You go in again, buying 149 shares as the small-cap growth firm rushes past a 22.44 buy point on July 17. By TAL's recent close at 32.92, that $3,343.56 stake is now up to $4,905.08. With just two buys, your portfolio has nearly doubled in value, minus commissions.No one is perfect. Let's say you had two duds after the first score.

645,ADS,"Gaming revenue in Macau, the world's biggest market for the industry, rose 5.7% in February, missing expectations. Shares of casino and resort giants Las Vegas Sands (LVS), Wynn Resorts (WYNN), MGM Resorts International (MGM) and Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO) initially held up near key support levels, but tumbled with the broader market.X The results come after casino sales jumped 36.4% higher in January, followed by an 11-month streak of double-digit sales gains last year. Those figures marked the best year-over-year increase since 2014, when a regulatory crackdown spooked VIP customers and weighed on revenue.For February of this year, analysts had expected a 9.9% revenue gain, according to Consensus Metrix.Melco Resorts fell 2.1% in the stock market today. Las Vegas Sands fell 2.7% and Wynn Resorts 2.4%.MGM Resorts, a more Las-Vegas-centric casino operator, retreated 2.8%. MGM recently opened a new location in Macau, a Chinese special administrative region and the only part of China where gambling is legal.All four stocks are trading further below their 50-day moving averages, with MGM approaching its 200-day line.Macau's results follow a tumultuous past few months for the casino business.Steve Wynn resigned as Wynn Resorts' CEO following allegations of sexual misconduct.

646,ADS,"Market-leading education firms TAL Education Group (TAL) and New Oriental Education (EDU) fell sharply down Monday amid political developments in their home country of China.X Meanwhile another Chinese company, Sunlands Online Education Group, has filed for a U.S. listing in an IPO that could raise up to $300 million, according to Chinese news organization Caixin.TAL, which is ranked No. 14 on the IBD 50, fell 5.25% to close at 36.81 on the stock market today, but closing above a 36.26 buy point cleared last week. New Oriental dropped 4.1% to 92.02, diving below its 50-day line. They are two of the top three performing stocks in the Consumer Services-Education group as measured by Composite Rating.Other Chinese education companies also slipped but not as much, with Rise Education (REDU) finishing down 3.4% and Tarena International (TEDU) dipping 0.5%. Among Chinese tech giants, Alibaba (BABA) edged up 0.5%, Weibo (WB) sank 5%, Sina (SINA) lost 2.5%, and Baidu (BIDU) gained 2.2%. TAL and Weibo were in Monday's IBD Stock Spotlight screen.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAccording to IBD Stock Checkup, the TAL's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a B+, indicating strong institutional demand over the last quarter. However, it was coming out of a later-stage base, having advanced more than 200% in 2017 alone. Later-stage bases are more likely to fail than earlier-stage formations.The falls come as investors keep a wary eye on political developments in economic powerhouse China. The ruling Communist Party put forward a proposal Sunday to remove the constitutional clause that sets the term limit on presidents to two terms in office.It is widely seen as a move to allow President Xi Jinping to stay in office indefinitely. While this could bring short-term benefits by bringing political continuity as the country works toward economic reforms, it also presents major risks in the longer term as it will allow Xi to tighten his grip on power.There is also uncertainty surrounding the administration of the stock market itself, with China's top securities regulator, Liu Shiyu, last week proposing to delay a deadline for the government to authorize a registration-based IPO mechanism until February 2020. The original deadline would expire on Feb. 28 of this year.The country announced plans in 2015 to shift to a U.S.-style registration system for stock-market flotations on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, but the National People's Congress has yet to approve the reform proposal.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, pay attention to the major averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases. TAL's dip comes despite a sunny outlook overall for the stock. In the most recent quarter — reported Jan. 25 — it saw a 125% earnings boost vs. the year-ago period, while revenue growth came in at 66%. Consensus estimates expect the firm's earnings to grow 14% in fiscal 2018 ending in February and 62% in 2019.The Chinese K-12 after-school tutoring market is expected to grow 15% annually until 2020, which bodes well for the space's leader, TAL Education.And earlier this month the firm signed an agreement with Oxford University Press that aims to bolster teacher training. TAL is to set up the Xueersi English Overseas Academic Research Institute in the English city of Oxford, which will focus on developing teachers' skills and improving learning content.By way of contrast, New Oriental missed fiscal second-quarter earnings estimates, but revenue and revenue guidance topped forecasts. The company earned nine cents a share adjusted, up 8%. Revenue rose 37% to $467.2 million. New Oriental was expected to report fiscal Q2 earnings of 11 cents a share, up 37.5%. Revenue is seen rising 34% to $464.05 million. Student enrollments rose 43% to 1.877 million.But the outlook was more positive, with New Oriental seeing current Q3 revenue of $591.1 million to $604.2 million. That's above the current consensus for $580.17 million.Meanwhile, Sunlands Online Education Group, which was founded in 2003, filed for a U.S. listing on Friday. The firm began as a traditional education company before transitioning four years ago to an online-focused business model. It now serves some 550,000 students.""The online education model has transformed the postsecondary and professional education market in China,"" Sunlands said in its IPO prospectus filed on Friday. ""It has made a tremendous number of students aware of the more flexible, cost-effective education solutions provided by online education. We expect that this trend will continue to drive further demand for such services and result in online education providers taking market share away from traditional offline players.""China's private-education programs are on the road to becoming a bigger, more competitive business thanks to a growing population of primary-school-age students and rising disposable income in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Is Trump's National Security Strategy On A Collision Path With Xi's China Vision?Best Chinese Stocks To Buy And WatchWhich Stocks Are Showing Rising Relative Strength?Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

Clovis shares, on the other hand, popped 6.6% to finish at 59.15.Analysts expect Clovis to grab approval for a second maintenance drug in ovarian cancer, helping it to compete against AstraZeneca (AZN) and Tesaro (TSRO). Exelixis' Cabometyx is still in the early days following approval as a first treatment in some kidney cancer patients.""We think U.S. approval of Rubraca in the broad second-line maintenance indication is an important growth driver for the product which has a competitive profile, according to physicians we surveyed in November,"" Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt said in a note to clients.Meanwhile, Exelixis reported $90.4 million in Cabometyx sales during its fourth quarter. That lagged the consensus for $98 million, RBC analyst Kennen MacKay wrote in his report to clients. This was the result of inventory drawdown and seasonal profit headwinds.MacKay called the miss ""unexpected,"" noting he had modeled 16% growth based on the number of Cabometyx prescriptions written in the fourth quarter vs. the third quarter.""However, we view the fourth quarter as a transitional quarter with minimal impact from the Dec. 19 approval of Cabometyx in first-line renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer),"" he said. ""We see this indication driving the Cabometyx franchise.""Cabometyx has grown its market share to 24% and tacked on 21% prescription growth in the first six weeks of 2018. This is ""indicative of a very strong launch in first-line renal cell carcinoma,"" MacKay said.Piper Jaffray analyst Edward Tenthoff forecasts Cabometyx penetrating 10% of the first-line renal cell carcinoma market. He expects 10% growth of Cabometyx as a treatment for kidney cancer that doesn't respond to other therapies.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD Newsletters""Importantly, Exelixis continues to invest in Cabometyx clinical development with now around 70 studies ongoing, including immuno-oncology combinations,"" he said in a note.Exelixis is facing off against Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), which is combining its checkpoint inhibitors Opdivo and Yervoy to treat the same population of kidney cancer patients. The Food and Drug Administration will consider Bristol's regimen in April.A recent trial showed Bristol's combination wasn't as effective in a group of patients with less of a key protein in their bodies. This should help Cabometyx, Tenthoff said.""Cabometyx should capture checkpoint failures, potentially expanding the currently addressable population,"" he said. ""More important, Cabometyx could ultimately compete in first-line renal cell carcinoma.""Rubraca brought in $17 million in fourth-quarter sales, flat and lagging the consensus for $19 million, RBC's MacKay wrote. But investors' focus is still on Rubraca getting approval as a second, maintenance treatment in ovarian cancer.This is ""where we anticipate the drug can be competitive,"" MacKay said.Clovis' Rubraca, along with drugs from AstraZeneca and Tesaro, are known as PARP inhibitors. They are being used to treat ovarian cancer, but have shown some promise as potential treatments in breast and prostate cancers.Rubraca was the first of the trio to get approval as a third treatment in a specific group of ovarian cancer patients. But AstraZeneca and Tesaro later got approval in the earlier and broader second-line maintenance population of ovarian cancer patients.The FDA is set to examine Rubraca as a second-line maintenance ovarian-cancer therapy in April. Leerink's Schmidt still sees Rubraca as capable of gaining a third of that market based on the strength of its clinical trial data.Further, Rubraca continues to maintain a leadership opportunity in a form of prostate cancer — ""the next large commercial opportunity for PARP inhibitors,"" Schmidt said.RELATED:Cancer Biotech Plunges Despite Narrowly Beating Quarterly Sales ViewsBiogen's Multiple Sclerosis Drug Franchise Takes Another HitCan CRISPR And These 3 Small Biotechs Cure 10,000 Diseases?

659,ADS,"Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) continued its two-day upswing Friday after announcing the launch of a generic version of a drug from Gilead Sciences (GILD), a day after the drugmaker unveiled a massive cost-cutting plan.X In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Teva lifted 6.2%, near 18.40. Earlier, the stock popped as much as 8.1%. Shares closed up 10.2% on Thursday, the day Teva said it would cut $3 billion by the end of 2019 to deal with its debt.Gilead's drug, Viread, is approved to treat HIV and hepatitis B in some patients. Teva is launching a generic version of Viread 300-milligram tablets in the U.S. in the hopes of taking a chunk of the $762 million in annual U.S. sales Viread garnered as of October.There are an estimated 1.1 million and 850,000 people living in the U.S. with HIV and chronic hepatitis B, respectively, who could benefit from Viread, Teva said in a news release. The launch adds to Teva's generic portfolio of nearly 600 medications.On Monday, Teva also announced its launch of a generic version of Viagra, which is branded by Dow stock Pfizer (PFE). As of August, the erectile dysfunction drug had annual sales of $1.4 billion in the U.S., Teva said in a news release.Goldman Sachs analyst Jami Rubin praised Teva for its plans to cut $3 billion in costs over the next two years. The cuts will come in the form of layoffs, closing manufacturing facilities and suspending its dividends on ordinary shares.IBD'S TAKE: Teva has an IBD Composite Rating of 14 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it underperforms the lion's share of stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But other generic drug stocks have stronger ratings like Ani Pharmaceuticals, which comes in at 97. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at other strong players in the generic-drug landscape.Rubin had initially expected Teva to announce a plan to cut $1 billion to $2 billion in costs by 2020. She expects New Chief Executive Kare Schultz to deliver on his promises based on a background at Lundbeck where he ""repeatedly understated and overdelivered.""""We acknowledge there is investor skepticism around the health of the base business, but note this is the first time in a while where we have seen a concrete strategy towards de-levering the company, which is a top priority,"" she said in a note to clients.The conference call on Thursday suggests a weaker base for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, but this will be more than offset by cost contribution, Rubin said.As part of the restructuring, Teva is combining its generics and specialty units, and will focus its efforts in the U.S., Europe and emerging markets. Rubin sees drugs in migraines and involuntary movements tied to Huntington's disease as leading Teva's specialty unit.Rubin acknowledges this could create additional downside risk to Teva's top line, but sees the exit from unprofitable businesses as a potential mark for the bottoming of U.S. generic pricing.""We are not calling the bottom yet, however, but will closely monitor the rate and magnitude of rationalization efforts as important sign posts,"" she said.She boosted her price target on Teva to 20 from 15 and upgraded the stock to a buy rating from neutral.RELATED:Teva Pharma Announces Layoffs, Suspends Dividends To Tackle DebtWhy Amgen Could Have An Edge Over These Rivals In Preventing MigrainesTeva's Restructuring Plan: Another Case Of Been Here, Done That?

CAR-T therapy teaches a patient's immune system to fight cancer using specific targets in the body.Cellectis describes its UCART platform as a ""frozen, off-the-shelf T-cell-based medicinal product."" It is allogeneic rather than autologous, meaning the cells used are from a donor and produced for a wide population rather than directly from the patient.""Fundamentally, the data presented established viability and success of allogeneic CAR-T, through a path to re-dosing and validation across multiple targets (which was previously thought to be impossible),"" Marai said.He reiterated his buy rating and 43 price target on Cellectis.RELATED:Why This Biotech Stock Is Defying A Hematology-Related PitfallWhy Gilead Could Have 'Greatest' Ever In HIV Drug LaunchesAmazon Reportedly In Talks With Mylan, Novartis About Pharma Entry

667,ADS,"China tariffs announced by the White House on Thursday sent a shockwave across global stock markets, in a wildly complex news week for investors. Markets knew the import tariffs were coming. And it was also no surprise that, by late Thursday, China had begun to set out its own import tariff targets in a tit-for-tat response.On China's stock markets, the Shanghai composite ended the week down 3.6%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 3.8%, with both giving up attempts to retake support at their 50-day moving averages. In relation to their Jan. 29 highs, the Hang Seng ended down 9.5%, and the Shanghai composite had corrected 12%.China-based stocks, which are currently a relatively small portion of the overall growth stock lineup, were under clear pressure for the week. But only a few showed any real chart damage.While global stock markets fear a trade war, the White House's penalties on China were not so much tariffs as they were an intent to advance toward tariffs. President Trump gave U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer 15 days to construct a list of China-based products on which to impose tariffs.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLighthizer is to seek input from companies and other government agencies in reviewing what is reportedly a list of 1,300 sorts of products from China. The final list aims to levy a reported $50 billion in annual trade penalties.The amount is roughly equivalent to the revenue the administration estimates U.S. companies in China lose each year as a result of forced technology transfers to local partners, according to an administration official quoted in Friday's South China Morning Post.The tactic is another instance of Trump's 'threaten, then bargain' approach to creating negotiating leverage. China's government provides the largest test so far for that strategy. Unlike Canada and Europe, China is also the first real non-democratic test for Trump's negotiating technique. In addition, the country also happens to be the largest holder of U.S. debt, and the largest buyer of U.S. Treasury bonds.These factors give a very trade-war savvy China broad flexibility in how it decides to respond to the U.S. trade-war threat.China has said it plans to challenge the tariffs by appeals through the World Trade Organization. But in an opening salvo on Thursday, it also imposed about $3 billion in tariffs on wine, fruit and almonds. Soybeans and other agricultural imports were previously named as retaliatory targets, as well as limiting U.S. companies' further access to financial markets.Among leading China-based stocks trading in the U.S., Baidu (BIDU) may have suffered some of the week's worst damage, diving almost 12%, to a test of support at its 40-week moving average. That puts the stock down 1% since the start of the year, and 15% below its March 12 high.RELATED:Stocks Dive On Trump Tariffs, But This Gauge Hints At BounceAfter Trump Tariffs Hit, China 'Not Afraid' To Fight Trade WarSteel Stocks Dive On Trump Tariff Exemptions As China Trade Is Top PriorityThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And TradeFed Rate Hike Is No Surprise, But Stock Market Weakens On Powell, 2019 Outlook

676,ADS,"I've always felt a kinship with Paul Ryan. Maybe it's the fact that we are both Jack Kemp acolytes. Maybe I have a soft spot for upright family men who are attracted to public policy by the desire to do good. Maybe I love conservative wonks. But Paul Ryan's fate over the past several years is as good an indication as any of how far our politics have fallen.Ryan's departure will not be mourned by Democrats or Trump loyalists. The Democrats caricatured Ryan as the goon throwing Granny in her wheelchair off a cliff. They actually ran TV ads with a Ryan lookalike. Barack Obama singled him out for scorn at a White House meeting, claiming later that he was unaware Ryan was in the front row.You might suppose that that would be enough to make Ryan a conservative hero, but life is often unjust, and when Donald Trump came along, Ryan found himself a sudden symbol of the reviled ""Republican establishment."" Though the anti-Ryan vitriol faded after Steve Bannon's defenestration, he continued to be viewed with suspicion by the talk radio crowd and other arms of Trump Inc.This was his reward for attempting to drag his party, and the country, toward a grown-up reckoning with our debt. Nearly single-handedly, Paul Ryan had managed to put tackling entitlements on the national agenda. As chairman of the budget committee, he convinced his colleagues to endorse modest entitlement reform. As he kept trying to explain, making incremental reforms now — with no changes for current beneficiaries or those in their 50s — can prevent drastic shortfalls and extreme benefit cuts that will be necessary in just 16 years, when Social Security is depleted. The outlook is even worse for Medicare and Medicaid.But Donald Trump arrived on scene with the supposedly blinding insight that changes to entitlements are unpopular. Well, no kidding. He promised never to touch Medicare and Social Security — not even to ensure their future solvency. And so, the responsible, future-oriented Paul Ryan found himself governing with a backward-looking, whistling-past-the-graveyard president.Even leaving aside the moral compromises that an alliance with Donald Trump necessitated, Ryan and the party he helped to lead also lost its compass on Ryan's own signature issue: fiscal responsibility.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTax reform may have been overdue, but it would have been nice if the party that fulminated about the dangers of deficits in the Obama years had found anything at all to cut — particularly as the economy is growing and unemployment is low.Instead, the budget and the tax bill combined will leave us with a federal budget deficit in excess of $1 trillion in 2020 and beyond.Congressional Budget Office Director Keith Hall said that federal debt ""is projected to be on a steadily rising trajectory throughout the decade."" Under Republican guidance, the federal deficit will be roughly double what it was in the final year of the Obama administration. That is the reality of Speaker Ryan's tenure in the age of Trump.It is often suggested that Trump has much to teach the Republican Party about the importance of the white working class and about the centrality of nationalism to Republican success.But just as with entitlement reform, it's one thing to say a thing is popular and quite another to say that it's right.What has Trump taught? That trade wars are the way to improve the lives of the working class? They are popular, at least with Republicans. A Politico/Morning Consult poll found that 65% of Republicans favored Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs. But if Republicans believe, as the overwhelming majority do, that tariffs are stupid and dangerous, then it would seem obvious that they have something to teach the president rather than the other way around.I can't say for sure, but I suspect that Paul Ryan's diagnosis of what ails America is pretty similar to my own. We are not behaving as responsible adults. Our greatest political challenge is out-of-control debt. Our greatest social challenges are declining families, increasing dependency and eroding social cohesion.The debt could have been addressed by government. The other trends continue to degrade our culture, our economy and our personal lives. And the ascension of Trumpian politics — slashing, mendacious, corrupt and polarizing — aggravates everything that was already going wrong.Paul Ryan didn't belong in Trump world. So much the worse for us.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:It's Official: Trump Tax Cuts Are Boosting Growth And Mostly Paying For ThemselvesHow Trump Schooled Xi In 'Art Of The (Trade) Deal'

But that was also the case for traditional CAR-T therapies. Then, Gilead and Novartis grabbed approvals in several types of blood cancer, Allogene Chief Executive and President David Chang said.""Many believed the idea of CAR-T therapy was rooted in science fiction, but science fiction has become a reality,"" he said in a written statement.Chang was Kite's chief medical officer and headed up its research department.

Cellectis is furthest along with an allogeneic approach, while Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP) is working on a rival.French pharma group Servier is sponsoring two clinical tests of Pfizer and Cellectis' partnered drug, UCART19. The drug is in Phase 1 studies as a potential treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Morgan Stanley touted Facebook, other FANG stocks and Apple (AAPL) on Monday, citing their ""substantial competitive moats.""Meanwhile, Twitter's revenue is falling while Snap is reporting big losses, and both Facebook rivals are struggling to increase users.IBD'S TAKE: Facebook is part of Leaderboard, IBD's premium service offering annotated charts of a select number of stocks, usually growth names in or near buy zones. Take a Leaderboard free trial.Snap came public at 17 in March and shot up to 29.44 intraday on its second day of trading. But shares fell sharply on concerns about user growth and Facebook's successful cloning of key Snapchat features, notably via Instagram Stories.Snap hit a record low of 11.28 on Aug. 14 and hit a short-term low of 12.10 on Nov. 8. Since then shares have been moving higher, working on a first-ever proper base with a 16.98 buy point.Snap shares shot up 7.6% to 18.22 on Monday, helped by a bullish note from Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co. analyst James Cakmak, who sees the Snapchat app operator's stock near a turning point. Snap executives seem to recognize the company's challenges, Cakmak noted. He also cited Snap's relationship with Chinese messaging and gaming giant Tencent (TCEHY). Tencent bought a sizable stake in Snap in November.As for Tencent, its shares rose 3.25% to 52.13, continuing a strong rebound from their 50-day line late last week.Twitter popped 4.5% to 22.05 on Monday. That's approaching a 22.58 buy point in a cup-with-handle base that goes back to October 2016.Twitter previously broke out past a 20.98 entry on Oct. 27, but within a few days had reversed and soon was down enough to invalidate the buy point.Keep in mind that both Snap and Twitter are well off 2017 highs, so there could be notable overhead resistance if the stocks break out.The Chinese short-messaging giant rose 3.75% to 104 on Monday, moving back above its 50-day moving average. Volume was below average, so investors should treat Weibo's move as a buying opportunity.Weibo does not have a buy point currently. Shares broke out from a 105.60 entry on Nov. 8, rising to 123 on Nov. 21. Shares then fell sharply, wiping out a 16.5% post-entry gain and then some. You should never let a 10% gain turn into a loss.Weibo is majority-owned by Sina (SINA). Sina rose 2.6% to 99.55 on Monday, below its 50-day line and above its 200-day.RELATED:The Big Picture: Why Tesla's Action Today Was So Bullish36 Top Funds Just Bought Shares In This Potential Breakout StockThese 2 Stocks Reclaimed Buy Points; 3 Others Are CloseFANG Stocks News & Quotes: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, GoogleBest Chinese Stocks To Buy And WatchHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

682,ADS,"Different situations call for different measures — literally. And this applies to the cup-with-handle base as well.XIn roaring bull markets, pick stocks that form bases within acceptable guidelines and stay away from ones that don't. But in nasty corrections or bear markets, some stocks with excellent fundamentals and outstanding institutional sponsorship will form deep bases.Not all of these should be shunned. Despite correcting more than normal, these deep patterns can still work, particularly when the company's fundamentals and other traits are outstanding.Take a common cup-with-handle base, for example. In an uptrending market, the correction from the high of the cup to the low in the pattern should ideally be no more than 30% to 33%.Be wary of stocks that form deep patterns during uptrending markets. But in down markets, the downdraft could knock stocks by 40%, 50% from their 52-week highs, or even more.These deep cup-with-handle bases aren't pretty technically, but you need to take a stock's correction in context with action in the overall market.Most stocks tend to be more volatile than the general market or a market index such as the S&P 500. Growth stocks, such as those featured in the IBD 50, IBD Big Cap 20 or Sector Leaders, can correct 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 times the general market. So if the market plunges 25%, you can easily see a leader get cut in half or more.From its October 2007 peak to its March 2009 low, the Nasdaq plunged 56%. During this time, a barrage of highly rated stocks carved out deep bases and still went on to become big winners.Baidu (BIDU) plummeted 74% from its May 2008 high to its December 2008 trough. It eventually recovered and cleared a deep cup-with-handle base in the week ended July 17, 2009. It doubled in eight months.Tech icon Apple (AAPL) soured 60% from its May 2008 peak to its January 2009 low. It broke out in May of 2009 and climbed nearly 60% in five months.These were abnormal declines, but they were a function of the severe bear market at the time.During the 1990-91 bear market, the S&P 500 dropped 20% while the Nasdaq tumbled 31%.Gaming equipment maker International Gaming Technology (IGT), meanwhile, had a more drastic correction. The stock dived 56% from its July 1990 peak of 20.25 to its October low of 9 (1).International Gaming rebounded and formed a V-shaped cup-with-handle base with a 16.60 buy point (adjusted for a 2-for-1 split in July 1990). The handle corrected 18% — a tad deeper than normal, but much milder than the decline within the cup.The stock had good IBD Ratings: a 73 for EPS and a 94 RS. The company's new microprocessor-based games were red-hot. Shares cleared the handle in the week ended Dec. 21 (2) but soon failed (3).International Gaming cleared another handle in the week ended Jan. 18, 1991 (4). Shares shot up 180% by May (5) before settling into another consolidation.(Editor's Note: This column originally ran in the Oct. 27, 2010, edition of IBD.

683,ADS,"The Relative Strength (RS) Rating for Diageo (DEO) entered a new percentile Thursday, with a rise from 79 to 83. X This proprietary rating identifies market leadership by using a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score that indicates how a stock's price performance over the trailing 52 weeks matches up against other publicly traded companies. Over 100 years of market history shows that the stocks that go on to make the biggest gains often have an 80 or better RS Rating as they launch their biggest price moves.See How IBD Helps You Make More Money In StocksDiageo is still within a buy zone after climbing above a 137.69 buy point in a flat base. Once a stock moves 5% or higher beyond the original entry, it's considered out of buy range. The company reported 23% earnings growth in the latest quarterly report, while sales growth came in at 15%. Diageo earns the No. 3 rank among its peers in the Beverages-Alcoholic industry group. Brown Forman (BFB) is the No. 1-ranked stock within the group.RELATED:Which Stocks Are Showing Improved Price Performance?Why Should You Use IBD's Relative Strength Rating?How Relative Strength Line Can Help You Judge A Stock

684,ADS,"One day after the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates for the third time this year, big-cap techs helped hoist the Nasdaq composite mildly higher in afternoon trading Thursday amid hopes for the U.S. stock market to end the year with gains in 11 of 12 months.XMeanwhile, Bitcoin fever stayed white hot.The Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), which whipsawed traders on Wednesday but still ended the session positive, rose another 1.7% to 2,374.99 in slightly higher than normal turnover. On Wednesday, the exchange traded fund reached as high as 2,549, up 158% after surpassing a 985.10 buy point in an unusually deep cup with handle just three weeks ago.Such gains are not abnormal for the Bitcoin-tracking ETF. From May 15 to May 25, the fund soared 200% over a nine-session period, from 188 to 565. After a steep correction in June and July, Bitcoin Investment Trust made another skyrocketing move, rising from 424 on Aug. 1 to 1,064 on Aug. 31, up 151%.The trust trades on average 99,000 shares each day over the past 50 sessions, up from 68,000 shares just seven weeks ago. For now, short-term traders can use the 10-day moving average, currently near 1,903, as a key technical tool in which to decide whether to take profits or hold longer.At 1 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite rose nearly 0.2% while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average were roughly flat. Volume is running mildly lower in today's market vs. the same time Wednesday.The NYSE composite was down 0.1%, threatening to snap a five-day winning streak, amid a nearly 3% slide for Chinese e-commerce and digital payments titan Alibaba (BABA).Alibaba, formerly on IBD Leaderboard, undercut its 50-day moving average more than two weeks ago and is currently making its deepest correction since it completed a long base at the end of last year. The megacap consumer spending and internet play broke out of that base at 104.67 in February and ramped up 82% before beginning its latest correction.Alibaba's long-term uptrend remains fully intact, and there is a healthy cushion above the stock's long-term 200-day moving average (see the 200-day line on any chart in MarketSmith, IBD's premium stock screen and charting service).Meanwhile, the new issues market remains very interesting for growth investors. IBD's New Issues Index is up 27.6% year to date, as seen on page B6 of the latest IBD Weekly print newspaper. That beats a 23.1% gain by the Dow Jones industrials over the same time frame, excluding dividends.Floor & Decor (FND), an April 27 IPO, rallied more than 4% to hit a multimonth high of 46.24 before receding. Notice on a daily chart how the small-cap stock met stiff upside resistance at the 45 level earlier in the week.Floor & Decor has yet to form a valid handle on the current cup base.Still, the specialist in tile, wood and other flooring for the home improvement and construction markets has shown good price-and-volume action since testing support at the now-rising 50-day moving average several times since October.The 50-day moving average, which tracks the average closing price over the past 50 sessions, is currently around 39.55 today vs. 36.66 at the start of the fourth quarter. A rising 50-day moving average is bullish; you want to see the line, painted in red in each IBD and MarketSmith chart, going up and not down since that reflects the medium-term price trend in the stock.Snap (SNAP) continues to rebound following bullish comments by UBS on prospects of better results in 2018. The Snapchat social network is also reportedly seeking to attract older generation consumers of social media. However, institutions are going to continue scrutinizing the Venice, Calif., firm's ability to go from bleeding red ink to turning an actual operating profit.Snap is expected to lose 65 cents a share this year and lose 57 cents in 2018. The large-cap company is a member of IBD's internet content industry group.In contrast, Floor & Decor has earned a profit every year since at least 2011. The Smyrna, Ga., firm is expected to see an 11% drop in fourth-quarter profit to 16 cents a share after earnings surged 64% in the year-ago quarter. But earnings are still seen rising 16% to 66 cents a share for the full year and jump another 29% to 85 cents in 2018.Floor & Decor grew earnings per share by 114%, 133%, 64%, 75%, 47% and 21% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters. The EPS Rating is a sterling 97.Canada Goose (GOOS) edged up nearly 0.6% to 27.90, aiming for a fifth gain in six sessions. The marketer of ultra luxury winter coats and cold weather apparel has performed like a stock market leader since its Oct. 31 breakout from a four-month cup with handle.Notice how the breakout got off to a rough start three days into the Halloween move. Yet shares did not dip more than 7% to 8% below the proper buy point of 21.84 (10 cents above the handle's high), nor did they touch the upward-sloping 50-day moving average. Thus, Canada Goose did not trigger the golden sell rule of investing.At this point, watch for a secondary entry point to possibly emerge.The Toronto-based firm posted a 32% rise in third-quarter profit to 29 cents a share as sales jumped 35% to $172.3 million. That was Canada Goose's fifth quarter in a row of healthy double-digit top-line growth.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Canada Goose boasts a maximum 99 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99 and the Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which analyzes price-and-volume action over 13 trailing weeks, is bullish at B+.RELATED:Can You Make A Million Dollars By Trading ETFs?

It's still in potential buy range from the rebound. But it's also close to a 26.20 cup-base entry, which sets up another opportunity. The ETF has made small gains in between some of the bases it's cleared as it advances along the 50-day line.The $497.7 million fund, which tracks the Dow Jones Global Select Dividend Index, marked its 10th anniversary last month. To be considered for inclusion in the index, companies must pay a current dividend, have a current-year dividend-per-share ratio greater than or equal to its five-year average ratio, and have a five-year average payout ratio of 60% or less for U.S. and European companies and 80% or less for all other countries.

Finland's Fortum, the U.K.'s easyJet and France's Natixis are also among its biggest holdings.IBD'S TAKE: Making money catching ETF uptrends requires knowledge about how to read charts.

687,ADS,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) could have a triple-pill treatment for cystic fibrosis as early as 2019, analysts said Thursday after the biotech initiated the first of its Phase 3 studies to test the drugs involved.X The pivotal trial ""should be short and sweet,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients. Vertex announced late Wednesday it's beginning a trial combining drugs known as VX-659, tezacaftor and ivacaftor to treat a group of cystic fibrosis patients.""This timing is two to four months ahead of our expectations and even more importantly, the trial will be shorter than the company's prior pivotal studies for its cystic fibrosis combinations,"" Porges said.In total, Vertex plans to enroll 360 patients in the trial. The goal is to improve patients' ability to forcefully expel air at week four of treatment. Safety will be evaluated through 12 weeks of treatment. Then, Vertex could file an application for approval in the U.S.Porges expects the trial to enroll very quickly and suggests a regulatory submission could occur as early as the first half of 2019. This means Vertex could start selling its treatment as early as the fourth quarter of 2019, up from earlier expectations for the first quarter of 2020.Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!""Our goal is to bring the best triple combination to patients as rapidly as possible, and this first Phase 3 study in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor is a significant step toward that goal,"" Vertex Chief Medical officer Jeffrey Chodakewitz said in a statement.Triple regimens could treat up to 90% of patients with cystic fibrosis, Vertex has said. AbbVie (ABBV) and Galapagos (GLPG) also are working on triple combinations, but analysts say the duo is lagging Vertex.Vertex is also planning to test the regimen of VX-659, tezacaftor and ivacaftor in a group of patients with a different genetic mutation. Another regimen of VX-445 with tezacaftor and VX-561 will be tested in two groups of patients with different mutations.Porges kept his outperform rating and 190 price target on Vertex stock. RBC analyst Brian Abrahams maintained his outperform rating on Vertex. Abrahams also expects the trial to move quickly and expects approval by the end of 2019.On the stock market today, Vertex lost a fraction to close at 157.59.RELATED:Sangamo Therapeutics Makes Double-Digit Gain On Gilead DealThese Biotechs Could Spring Back After Market Correction: AnalystWhy Payers Won't Balk At $292,000 Price Tag For Vertex's New Drug

689,ADS,"Market breadth continues to improve as the key indexes showed solid gains on Monday with just two trading sessions remaining in February.X The advance is even more impressive given the negative reaction among a few Chinese companies trading on the NYSE, including New Oriental Education (EDU) and TAL Education (TAL), amid news that China's leader, Xi Jinping, may be able to exceed his two-term limit as the country's president.TAL fell more than 5%, yet closed near the top of its intraday range. At 36.81, the stock also is holding mildly above a 36.26 buy point in a choppy late-stage base. TAL has been a monster winner, rising nearly six-fold since it initially broke out of an excellent cup with handle at 6.54 (adjusted for a 6-for-1 stock split) in the week ended Nov. 13, 2015. That base could also be interpreted as a double bottom.New Oriental, down 4% to 92.02, is trading just below a 50-day moving average and may be in the early stages of forming a new base.Plus, leading Chinese internet and e-commerce stocks don't seem to be having a severe reaction overall. Autohome (ATHM), part of IBD Leaderboard, fell more than 2%, but volume was mildly below average.The auto information website is up 28% year-to-date and remains on the north side of its 50-day moving average. Autohome, being a midcap firm with a market value of just under $10 billion, still tends to trade more wildly than, say, any stock on the Dow Jones industrial average.The Nasdaq gained 0.9% amid nice rallies by the FAANG stocks, while the S&P 500 matched that gain. Alphabet (GOOGL), which stands a good chance of posting mild double-digit profit growth in both 2018 and 2019, rose 1.1% to 1,141 in light trade and is working on new cup-type base.A cup base must be a minimum of six weeks in length, while a strong cup with handle should never be less than seven weeks.Alphabet is up more than 8% year to date, and its relative strength line (drawn in blue in every IBD chart) reflects outperformance vs. the S&P 500 for more than two weeks. The megacap tech is also up more than 13% (or extended) from an October breakout past a well-formed flat base that showed a 1,006.29 buy point, or a dime above the base's left-side peak set on July 24.The stock market followed through on Valentine's Day, when the Nasdaq ripped 1.9% higher in heavier volume vs. the prior day. That big gain came on day four of a new rally attempt following a nearly 12% correction by the leading market index.Also on Feb. 14, the S&P 500 rallied 1.3% higher as NYSE volume rose, marking a follow-through day of its own.Leading stocks lagged a bit, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) gained just 0.5%. The exchange traded fund managed by Innovator Capital that tracks stocks in the IBD 50 was up more than 37% in 2017.Top industry groups for the day included solar, computer networking, RV makers, fiber-optic telecom equipment, mortgage services, airlines and movies, all up 2% or more. Only a handful of IBD's 197 industry groups fell 1% or more, including dairy products, home-furnishings retailers, specialty retailers and auto parts.Another reason why Monday's gain is impressive: U.S. new-home sales for January came in at 593,000 on an annualized rate, badly missing the Econoday estimate of 640,000. Indeed, interest-rate-sensitive names are struggling in 2018 as U.S. government bond prices keep falling, jacking up interest rates.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond was around 2.86%, still off its recent peak of 2.95%, but up from 2.40% at the end of last year.Year to date, at least 14 of IBD's 197 industry groups have risen 10% or more. And 11 groups sport an advance of 12% or more. In contrast, the S&P 500, at 2779, is up less than 4% since Jan. 1, excluding dividends.Such information is vital for the growth investor. Why?Decades of research by IBD show that as much as half of a great stock market winner's move is influenced by the performance of its broad industry sector and precise industry group. For this reason, IBD ranks every one of the 197 industry groups and subgroups by six-month relative performance each day. See the current list in IBD Data Tables, featured inside IBD Stock Lists.Leisures-Movies and Retail-Internet are up 21% and 20%, respectively, since Jan. 1.

690,ADS,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) could have a triple-pill treatment for cystic fibrosis as early as 2019, analysts said Thursday after the biotech initiated the first of its Phase 3 studies to test the drugs involved.X The pivotal trial ""should be short and sweet,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients. Vertex announced late Wednesday it's beginning a trial combining drugs known as VX-659, tezacaftor and ivacaftor to treat a group of cystic fibrosis patients.""This timing is two to four months ahead of our expectations and even more importantly, the trial will be shorter than the company's prior pivotal studies for its cystic fibrosis combinations,"" Porges said.In total, Vertex plans to enroll 360 patients in the trial. The goal is to improve patients' ability to forcefully expel air at week four of treatment. Safety will be evaluated through 12 weeks of treatment. Then, Vertex could file an application for approval in the U.S.Porges expects the trial to enroll very quickly and suggests a regulatory submission could occur as early as the first half of 2019. This means Vertex could start selling its treatment as early as the fourth quarter of 2019, up from earlier expectations for the first quarter of 2020.Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!""Our goal is to bring the best triple combination to patients as rapidly as possible, and this first Phase 3 study in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor is a significant step toward that goal,"" Vertex Chief Medical officer Jeffrey Chodakewitz said in a statement.Triple regimens could treat up to 90% of patients with cystic fibrosis, Vertex has said. AbbVie (ABBV) and Galapagos (GLPG) also are working on triple combinations, but analysts say the duo is lagging Vertex.Vertex is also planning to test the regimen of VX-659, tezacaftor and ivacaftor in a group of patients with a different genetic mutation. Another regimen of VX-445 with tezacaftor and VX-561 will be tested in two groups of patients with different mutations.Porges kept his outperform rating and 190 price target on Vertex stock. RBC analyst Brian Abrahams maintained his outperform rating on Vertex.

753,ADS,"The results of a trial studying an ovarian cancer regimen from Tesaro (TSRO) and Merck (MRK) had analysts split on Tuesday — leading Tesaro shares to dip for the second day running.Preliminary results showed the cocktail of Tesaro's Zejula and Keytruda from Dow Jones stock Merck could provide a stronger defense than chemotherapy for hard-to-treat ovarian cancer patients. But at least one analyst was unimpressed.RBC analyst Kennen MacKay noted overall responses of 26%-29% aren't meaningfully better than solo treatment with what's called a PARP inhibitor. Tesaro's Zejula is a PARP inhibitor whereas Merck's drug is an immuno-oncology drug known as a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor.""Further, these data look to be inferior vs. competitor immuno-oncology combo data seen yesterday from ImmunoGen's (IMGN) (drug known as) mirvetuximab soravtansine and Keytruda"" in a heavily pre-treated group of ovarian cancer patients, MacKay said in a note.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn the stock market today, Tesaro slipped 4% to close at 56.70. Merck lost 0.5% to 53.75. ImmunoGen, which also presented data in ovarian cancer, plummeted 15% to 11.01. Biotech stocks broadly fell 3.6%.Tesaro studied a combination of Zejula and Keytruda in patients with ovarian cancer that is either resistant to or doesn't respond to platinum-based therapy. Overall, 25% of patients responded to the regimen. The combination also achieved a 68% disease control rate.In patients who don't respond to platinum-based therapy, the overall response rate was 24%. Typically, just 5%-18% of platinum-resistant patients respond to chemotherapy. Responses are generally much lower for patients who don't respond at all to platinum-based therapy.Patients whose tumors didn't have a mutation of the BRCA gene had an overall response rate of 26%. Historically, patients who don't have a BRCA mutation and are platinum-resistant have a low 5%-10% response to treatment with a PARP inhibitor like Zejula alone.Tesaro is now planning a registrational trial for Zejula and its own drug, TSR-042. The investigational drug is an antibody that targets the PD-1 protein.RBC's MacKay noted the Zejula-Keytruda combination looked inferior to a cocktail from rival ImmunoGen and Merck. ImmunoGen tested its drug mirvetuximab soravtansine and Keytruda in ovarian cancer patients who are resistant to platinum-based therapy.The combination achieved a 43% overall response rate in a heavily pre-treated group of ovarian cancer patients.Interestingly, AstraZeneca (AZN) also combined an immuno-oncology drug with a PARP inhibitor in patients who do respond to platinum-based therapy. In that study, overall responses ranging from 67%-77% aren't meaningfully better than treatment with a PARP inhibitor, alone, he said.""While these data remain early, we note that taken together they do not compellingly speak to transformative synergistic potential of PARP inhibitor plus immuno-oncology combos despite continued investment,"" he said.Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young still sees potential for combinations of PARP inhibitors and immuno-oncology drugs. Zejula and Keytruda together improved on the standard of care in ovarian cancer, she said in a note.Similarly, AstraZeneca's regimen of PARP inhibitor Lynparza and immuno-oncology medicine Imfinzi showed an overall response rate of 72% in ovarian cancer. The disease control rate at week 12 was 81%.Young also calls for use of PARP inhibitors outside of ovarian cancer. U.S. regulators have approved drugs from Tesaro, Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and AstraZeneca as second treatments for ovarian cancer patients who are sensitive to platinum-based therapies.Ongoing studies are looking at PARP inhibitors in ovarian, prostate and breast cancers.""Ultimately, we expect the PARP inhibitor market to grow overall and we think there could be space for three PARP inhibitors,"" she said. ""Data sets in the next 12-18 months will support the expanded opportunity we believe there is for the PARP class.""RELATED:How Much Money Do You Need To Start Investing?Investing Basics: How To Sell A StockLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

The chip-equipment giant was not yet active Tuesday.Applied Materials cleared that entry decisively in early March and rose to a record 62.40 on March 12.

A dual listing would give Chinese companies the option of raising money domestically and help boost their profile at home.Due to China regulations, investors in the country have largely missed out on the gains attained by Alibaba's rise on the NYSE since its blockbuster IPO in September 2014. Shares of Alibaba, which had an IPO price of 68, have almost tripled. Alibaba stock climbed 3.4% to close at 199.06 on the stock market today.Chinese regulators have been working on enabling China companies trading abroad, such as Alibaba, JD.com (JD), Baidu (BIDU) and Tencent Holding (TCEHY) to list at home.

762,ADS,"With the stock market plunging and the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones industrial average plummeting to right above their 200-day moving averages, this is not a good time to make new purchases. But it's a good time to be looking for growth stocks to add to your watch list. In the IBD 50 list of top stocks, five are seen reporting faster earnings growth next quarter: Nvidia (NVDA), Alibaba (BABA), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Five Below (FIVE) and Paycom Software (PAYC).All five stocks have Composite Ratings above 95, meaning that they outperform more than 95% of all stocks based on key metrics, including earnings. All-time stock winners often have Composite Ratings of at least 95 near the start of their big runs. Paycom Software and Palo Alto Networks have best-possible 99 Composite Ratings. Alibaba has a 98 CR, followed by Five Below at 97 and Nvidia at 96.Alibaba is expected to report earnings per share growth of 49% for the current quarter after a 25% year-over-year gain in the latest quarter. The Chinese e-commerce giant actually missed December-quarter EPS estimates slightly as it spends heavily on cloud computing and other projects. But that's helped fuel huge revenue gains. Sales surged 66% in the latest quarter, the best in 15 quarters. That top-line growth is now seen putting the gas on the bottom line.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAlibaba has been working on a consolidation with a 206.30 buy point, but the stock tumbled 9.5% last week to 181.20, falling through its 50-day moving average. Blame the general stock market sell-off and a tumble by archrival Tencent (TCEHY), following its earnings report last week.Alibaba rose 5.1% to 190.50 on the stock market today, retaking its 50-day line as the major averages rallied on easing trade war fears.Nvdia earnings per share are expected to soar 84%, improving from last quarter's 59%, which barely slowed from the prior quarter's 60%.It's amazing that Nvidia could be accelerating earnings growth after such a long run of huge year-over-year growth. But the graphics-chip maker is benefiting from booming demand in artificial intelligence, autonomous driving and more.Nvidia stock sank 7% last week to 232.97, dropping below its 50-day line on Friday.Its shares climbed 4.9% to 244.48 Monday, rebounding back above the 50-day.Nvidia holds its GPC Technology Conference this week, starting Monday, covering artificial intelligence, autonomous driving, augmented reality and more. CEO Jensen Huang will give a keynote address at 9 a.m. PT on Tuesday.Palo Alto Networks' EPS should ramp up from 37% in the latest quarter to 56%. Revenue growth nudged up to 28% in the latest quarter from 27%. Shares of the cybersecurity firm fell 3% to 181.76 last week, but that was better than the major stock market indexes. Palo Alto stock is well extended from a February breakout at 156.95.Palo Alto was up 3.2% to 187.55 Monday.The teen-focused retailer reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings last week, with EPS up 31% vs. a year earlier. Five Below guided current-quarter EPS estimates to 31-34 cents vs. the then-consensus of 23 cents. Not all analysts have yet revised their earnings estimates following the Q4 report and guidance. But if you take the midpoint of Five Below's target, 32.5 cents, then earnings should surge 117%. That's by far the strongest expected growth and biggest acceleration of the stocks cited here.Five Below rallied 4.2% on Thursday following earnings. The stock rose to 72.20 intraday Friday, briefly clearing a 71.69 cup-with-handle buy point. But with the S&P 500 index and stock market selling off, Five Below reversed to close down 1.3% to 69.03. The stock did manage to eke out a 0.1% weekly gain.Five Below popped 3.9% on Monday to 71.71, just above its 71.69 entry.Paycom Software earnings growth should pop to 91% from 61%. Paycom is one of several highly rated software companies specializing in payroll and human resources. Business software generally has been performing well.Its stock hit a record high on Wednesday, but closed the week down 3.2% to 106.79.Paycom jumped 6.6% to 113.87 on Monday.Ultimately, earnings are what drive stocks and the broader stock market higher. So while active investors should pay close attention to stock charts, you have to remember the fundamentals.But the fundamentals and technicals go hand in hand. It's not surprising that top stocks expected to accelerate profit growth should have relative strength lines at or near record highs. The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, makes it easy to spot true stock market winners, vs. laggards. In a struggling stock market like this one, investors should look for growth names with RS lines at or near highs. These may be the stocks that lead the next rally. YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Facebook Still In Focus, Red Hat Earnings Due After Market Sell-OffThe Big Picture: Stock Market Faces Final TestThese 5 Hot Software Stocks Are Showing Strength Near HighsConsider These 3 Defense Giants For Your Stock ArsenalWhy Did These 4 IBD 50 Stocks Shine As Boeing, Alphabet Tumbled?

Recode says there are about a half dozen more in the works, however, citing people familiar with the matter.Expect more developments coming down the pipe: JD.com said in February that it had raised $2.5 billion that it intends to plunk down on delivery innovation.""This current funding round sets the stage for us to further invest in expanding our lead in the sector in areas like automation, drones and robotics,"" said JD.com CEO Richard Liu in a statement.U.S.-listed shares of JD.com were down 1.1% on the stock market today as fellow Chinese internet giant Tencent (TCEHY) reported weaker-than-expected quarterly revenue growth.

770,ADS,"As the major indexes continue to hold near all-time highs, it might be time to take profits in these winning stocks: Grubhub (GRUB), Planet Fitness (PLNT) and Caterpillar (CAT). Weight Watchers (WTW) and Autohome (ATHM) also have reached similar gains, but you may want to hold onto these fast risers.X Grubhub settled Friday 21% above a flat base with a 57.71 buy point initially cleared on Oct. 25. When a stock becomes 20% to 25% extended past a buy point, that's usually a good time to take at least partial profits, meaning sell part of your position.But an argument could be made for holding onto — or buying more — Grubhub shares, depending on how they act around the 50-day line. Typically, the first and second successful rebounds from the 50-day line after a breakout are considered add-on buying opportunities. Grubhub also could be starting to form a new base.However, the relative strength line, which tracks the stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been slumping since Grubhub's stock peaked on Nov. 20.Grubhub rose 0.1% soon after the opening bell on the stock market today.The action of Planet Fitness shares is similar to that of Grubhub's. An earnings-inspired gap-up in early November sent shares surging out of a flat base. The stock has pulled back a few bucks from an all-time high in late December, but is successfully finding support at the 50-day line.Planet Fitness edged up 0.8% early Monday.Caterpillar has been on a steady rise since clearing a 140.54 entry point on Nov. 30. Up 21% from the buy point as of the end of last week, Caterpillar is set to report Q4 results on Thursday. The stock has gapped up on earnings for at least the last two quarterly reports, but has already been on a big run.Caterpillar fell a fraction Monday morning.Weight Watchers has made quick gains since its last breakout, running up 20% as of Friday in less than 10 trading sessions after its breakout from a cup-with-handle base. But you may want to hold onto Weight Watchers. If a stock runs up 20% or more within the first three weeks of the breakout and the market is in a healthy uptrend, you should hold that stock for eight weeks to see if it can be held for longer-term gains. Fast risers often have the best gains.The relative strength line is continuing to trend higher, which is a positive sign.Weight Watchers sank 0.4% early Monday.Autohome ended last week 22% above a buy point after breaking out of a long consolidation. Like Weight Watchers, Autohome ran up quickly, triggering the eight-week hold rule.Over the past few sessions, the Chinese internet stock has not been able to close at the high end of its intraday range. Still, Autohome has only logged three down days since clearing the buy point.Autohome rose 0.7% early Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Our New America section featured Autohome right after it powered into new high ground, launching a strong run.

778,ADS,"Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Mylan (MYL) were among a group of generic-drug makers hit Thursday after a consortium of hospitals said they would make medicines themselves to circumvent rising drug prices.X An estimated 300 hospital groups are involved in the effort, which would create a nonprofit company to provide generic medicines to hospitals, according to the New York Times. The goal is to avoid rising drug prices and medicine shortages.On the stock market today, generic stocks collectively dipped 1.3% after falling 2.7% in earlier trades. Shares of Teva fell 3.6% to close at 20.71, while Mylan lost 0.6% to 46.51.

779,ADS,"AstraZeneca (AZN) could bring in $3.8 billion in peak sales of immuno-oncology drug Imfinzi, an analyst said Thursday, citing a survey of oncologists who predict its broad use in lung cancer.X The survey of 51 oncologists suggests broad uptake of Imfinzi in advanced lung cancer patients who can't be treated with surgery. Respondents said they plan to use Imfinzi in 64% of these types of patients, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez wrote in a note to clients.Further, 65% of those surveyed said they have patients they view as treatable with surgery but would be better suited with a round of chemotherapy and radiation followed by Imfinzi therapy. These oncologists expect to treat half of those patients with Imfinzi.""One physician noted that he has not run into any reimbursement difficulties despite the agent not yet being approved in this setting,"" Fernandez said. ""He would like to see an overall survival benefit, but this has not stopped him from using the agent in the meantime.""Imfinzi is not yet approved to treat lung cancer. In October, the Food and Drug Administration accepted AstraZeneca's application for Imfinzi as a first treatment for advanced lung cancer patients who aren't eligible for surgery. The drug is already approved for use in some bladder cancer patients.Another physician said Imfinzi could be a potential option for advanced lung cancer patients who can't tolerate a combined round of chemo and radiation, and that there may be a large number of these patients.IBD'S TAKE: AstraZeneca has an IBD Composite Rating of 57 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it outperforms nearly six in 10 stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Get a look at top-rated drug stocks by visiting IBD Stock Checkup.Fernandez boosted his forecast on peak global Imfinzi sales to $3.8 billion from $2.3 billion in 2026. Imfinzi represents just 1% of the monthly immuno-oncology market, but sales have been on the rise since a presentation of clinical data in September, he said.Imfinzi works by blocking an interaction involving the PD-L1 protein in the body that would otherwise prevent an immune response to cancer. It competes against Roche's (RHHBY) Tecentriq, another PD-L1 inhibitor also approved in bladder cancer.Dow stock Merck's (MRK) Keytruda and Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Opdivo, known as PD-1 inhibitors, are similar. Oncologists surveyed also are bullish on the uptake of Keytruda in advanced lung cancer.Oncologists have ""a high degree of enthusiasm for combination regimens — particularly those with chemotherapy,"" Fernandez said. That puts Merck at the forefront. This week, Merck unveiled strong results for its regimen of Keytruda and chemo in lung cancer.Physicians are also hopeful for a combination of Bristol's Opdivo and its immuno-oncology drug Yervoy. Yervoy is known as a CTLA-4 inhibitor. But, Fernandez noted, they tend to view combos like Bristol's as more toxic than regimens like Merck's Keytruda plus chemo.At the closing bell on the stock market today, AstraZeneca inched down a penny to 35.07. Merck lost 1.5% to 61.13, as Bristol edged down 2 cents to 61.83.

781,ADS,"Despite a blowout earnings report by Twitter (TWTR) last week that indicated its turnaround strategy is working, short sellers continued to increase their position in the social media company, according to financial research firm S3 PartnersX Short interest in Twitter has been climbing throughout 2018, S3 said in a note late Tuesday. The value of Twitter short positions started the year at $911 million and has added $400 million since then for total short interest of $1.3 billion, said S3.That's the eighth-largest short position in the internet and software services sector worldwide, it said.""Unless the firm can continue to increase revenue and profits without depending on cutting R&D, sales and marketing expenses, shorts will continue to hold onto or build their short exposure waiting for Twitter's stock price to fall back into the teens,"" S3 said.Last week, Twitter received several price-target increases from analysts after a fourth-quarter earnings report that topped the consensus estimates, reported after the market close on Wednesday. On Thursday, Twitter shares rose as much as 30% before settling back to finish the regular session at 30.18, up 12%.Twitter shares climbed 8.1% to close at 33.44 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Twitter has a strong IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of a possible 99 and a strong Relative Strength Rating of 98.

But if shares rise, the short seller can face big losses.Other targets of short sellers include Alibaba Group (BABA). S3 said short interest in Alibaba shares, by dollar volume, is among the highest of any stock worldwide. Short interest in Alibaba exceeds $22.4 billion, it said.Alibaba reported its fastest revenue growth in at least 15 quarters for its fiscal third quarter, but earnings fell short of estimates.

785,ADS,"What's behind Arista Networks' (ANET) big sell-off today following its fourth-quarter earnings report and 2018 guidance? Its legal and marketing battle with Cisco Systems (CSCO) played a part, say analysts.X On its earnings call, Arista told analysts that revenue growth from its ""cloud"" customers — the likes of Microsoft (MSFT), Facebook (FB) and Amazon.com (AMZN) — slowed because of a prolonged ""workaround"" process tied to its long-running Cisco legal battle.Arista, a maker of computer network switches, plummeted 19% to close at 249.49 on the stock market today. Cisco gained 0.6% to 44.33. Arista stock had run-up 200% the past year before it reported earnings late Thursday.Shares plunged Friday in the highest volume of the stock's run, which triggers a sell signal. The stock also is close to erasing a 27% gain from a breakout past a 245.75 buy point Jan. 8 as shares head to a weekly loss in the highest weekly volume since Arista went public. Investors who bought near that entry should sell.

If that's the case, cloud revenue should rebound in the first half of 2018. On the other hand, Arista's earnings call commentary set the expectation for ""mid-20s"" revenue growth in 2018, which is below the street's 27.5% estimate, analysts say.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersBears argue that there's more going on than delays in the software work-around process.

788,ADS,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq 100 rose modestly early Friday.X On Thursday, the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones reclaimed their 50-day moving average, a day after the Nasdaq composite did. Apple (AAPL), Applied Materials (AMAT) and Baidu (BIDU) also rose above that key support, and in strong volume.Meanwhile, hot techs Arista Networks (ANET) and LogMeIn (LOGM) fell sharply overnight following their earnings reports.The market is in a confirmed uptrend, rallying strongly for the past five sessions. That means investors should be looking for possible buys. But after such a quick stock market correction and rapid recovery, many leaders have messy charts, to say the least. Also, after five straight gains, the major averages easily could have a pullback.S&P 500 futures rose nearly 0.4% vs. fair value. Dow Jones futures were up almost 0.4%. Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.5%.Apple rose 3.4% to 172.99 in Thursday's stock market trading, retaking its 50-day moving average in volume that was 39% above normal. Apple got a boost as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and David Tepper's Appaloosa Management disclosed that they added Apple shares in Q4.Apple has risen for five straight sessions, rebounding 15%, with above-average trade in four of those days.Meanwhile, Apple's relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been on the rise since Feb. 2. The RS line, the blue line in the chart below, had been lagging for nearly three months, hitting a one-year low on Feb. 2.While not shown on the chart, the RS line has now crossed over its own 50-day average, another positive signal.Apple does not have a clear buy point, but its recovery is encouraging, especially given its weight in the major averages.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersApplied Materials dithered for much of Thursday, but ultimately rallied 3.9% to 53.99, reclaiming its 50-day line in double normal volume. Late Wednesday, the chip equipment giant reported strong earnings and guidance, doubled its dividend and announced a new $6 billion buyback. Applied Materials also has risen for five straight sessions, four of which were in higher volume. The RS line also turned up, also nudging past its 50-day.Applied Materials is in a double-bottom base with a 58.83 buy point.Baidu vaulted 5.2% to 248.20 on Thursday, its fifth straight gain, all in heavy volume. On Tuesday, the Chinese search giant reported strong earnings and revenue.The RS line also has turned up, crossing above its own 50-day line, like the RS lines of Apple and Applied Materials.Baidu is in a consolidation with a 275.07 buy point, though aggressive investors could  use 265.87 as an early entry.Arista Networks earnings sped past views late Thursday, but revenue didn't beat by much, while its sales and gross margins guidance was light. Arista shares plunged nearly 10% in early Friday trading. The stock had closed up 1.9% to 307.96, hitting a record high intraday.LogMeIn edged past earnings views, but gave revenue guidance that was below estimates. LogMeIn also sold Xively, its Internet of Things unit, to Alphabet (GOOGL)-unit Google for $50 millionLogMeIn initially tumbled late Thursday well below a 128.45 buy point from a cup-with-handle base cleared Wednesday. Early Wednesday, LogMeIn briefly moved higher, but then traded down 4.3% to 128.Overnight trading doesn't always translate into how a stock will behave at the open or close of the following session.

789,ADS,"Scandal: For more than a year, Democrats have been pushing the story that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to steal the election from Hillary Clinton. But the evidence keeps piling up indicating that it was Democrats, wittingly or not, who've been helping Russia achieve its real meddling goals.The latest comes from the indictments issued Friday by Special Counsel Robert Mueller against 13 Russians accused of illegally meddling in the U.S. political system. This has been taken by Trump critics as proof that Russia did, indeed, conspire to meddle in the election.But if you read the indictments, look at the Facebook ads, the Trump ""dossier"" and other evidence, it becomes clear that the goal of this meddling wasn't to elect Trump, but to create anger, hostility, bitterness, and discord in the U.S.Consider what's quoted in the indictment as the goals of these Russians:Although not in the indictment itself, it's already been reported that in May 2016, two Russian-backed groups — ""Heart of Texas"" and ""United Muslims of America"" — organized both pro- and anti-Muslim rallies outside an Islamic center in Houston, where the two rallies squared off.Notice what's missing here? Any mention of electing Trump president. Over and over again, the stated goal of these groups, according to Mueller's indictment, wasn't to get Trump elected, but to set Americans at each other's throats.The indictment makes much of the ads these Russians bought on Facebook, and it suggests that these efforts were designed to disparage Clinton and support Trump.But the Facebook VP of Ad Product Rob Goldman reviewed every ad in question, and noted in a series of tweets over the weekend that "" I can say very definitively that swaying the election was *NOT* the main goal.""No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveMost of the ads didn't mention the election or any candidate. A quarter of them weren't seen by anybody. And, as Goldman notes, ""The majority of the Russian ad spend happened AFTER the election.""How does this point to a Russian effort to elect Trump? It doesn't. But as Goldman notes with apparent frustration, nobody wants to hear that.""We shared that fact, but very few outlets have covered it because it doesn't align with the main media narrative of Tump (sic) and the election.""We noted in this space last October that other examples of Russia's ""meddling"" didn't support the Democrats claims, either. One campaign was called ""Don't Shoot Us."" Among other things, tried to encourage those playing the augmented reality game  Pokémon Go to find and train Pokémon near locations where alleged incidents of police brutality had taken place, and name their Pokémon after the victims.In case anyone has forgotten, police brutality and social justice reform were Democrat issues.The Mueller indictment also points out that the Russians organized rallies in favor of Trump. But they also organized at least two anti-Trump rallies after the election.The Russians ""organized a rally in New York called 'Trump is NOT my President' held on or about November 12, 2016.""They ""organized a rally entitled 'Charlotte Against Trump' in Charlotte, North Carolina, held on or about November 19, 2016.""It's worth noting that the New York rally received extensive coverage from the mainstream press, who were apparently uninterested in the rally's sponsorship.Even the much-ballyhooed Trump dossier fails to support a claim that Russia was bent on getting Trump elected. If that were the case, why would top Russian officials have been feeding dirt to Christopher Steele, who then tried to peddle it to the press before the election?""If any part of the Steele dossier is accurate, Russia was playing both sides of the fence,"" noted Real Clear Politics Washington bureau chief Carl Cannon.The Mueller indictment does allege that these Russian operations were ""primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump.""But think about this for a moment. No one in the U.S. or around the world thought Trump had any chance of winning the election. On the day of the election itself, the highly cited poll analysis group FiveThirtyEight gave Trump a 28.6% chance of winning the election.When the Russian efforts were supposedly going on in earnest, FiveThirtyEight put Trump's odds in the teens. (In the end, the IBD/TIPP poll was one of the only national polls to show a Trump victory.)It's more likely that those anti-Hillary efforts weren't designed to help defeat her, but to weaken her presidency after she got elected, just as the Russian-informed Trump ""dossier"" has weakened Trump's presidency.So, to sum up: There's been no credible evidence presented so far — none — of any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia to sway the November election, despite more than a year-and-a-half of relentless FBI and media investigations.But there is growing evidence that, as Facebook's Goldman put it:""The main goal of the Russian propaganda and misinformation effort is to divide America by using our institutions, like free speech and social media, against us. It has stoked fear and hatred amongst Americans. It is working incredibly well. We are quite divided as a nation.""Indeed it has worked incredibly well.The problem is that Democrats and the mainstream press will never admit any of this, because if they did, they'd also be admitting that they were co-conspirators in this nefarious Russian campaign to undermine America's democratic institutions.During the Cold War, there was a label for Americans who unwittingly did Russia's bidding — ""useful idiots.""Perhaps it's time to resurrect this label.You might also be interested in ...The Trump, Clinton Scandals Are Claiming A Lot Of Bodies — At FBI And JusticeJustice, FBI Russia-Trump Investigation Just Got Even More Corrupt — Why Does It Continue?Russia-Trump Investigation: How Did Hillary Clinton Get FBI, FISA To Do Her Political Dirty Work?

791,ADS,"The S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite continued to rebound, despite rising inflation pressures and Treasury yields, triggering a shift from market correction to confirmed uptrend. Cisco Systems (CSCO) reported strong earnings, along with Weibo (WB) and other China internets as well as several other top-rated tech stocks. Top-rated hotels were mixed after their reports. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) hired Taco's chief to be its next CEO. Facebook (FB) showed signs of losing more young users to Snap (SNAP)-owned.X After plunging in the prior two weeks, the S&P 500 index, Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite surged in the latest week, shrugging off rising prices and the continued rise in Treasury yields. The market is back in an uptrend. Cisco hit a 17-year high on a bevy of good news. Shopify (SHOP), Hubspot (HUBS) and Weibo (WB) also had good results. But Arista Networks (ANET) and LogMeIn (LOGM) fell Friday on guidance.Cisco Systems (CSCO) announced a $25 billion stock buyback, topped earnings forecasts, reported its first revenue gain in eight quarters and guided March quarter views higher. Aside from the new $25 billion buyback, Cisco plans to use some of the $67 billion in repatriated cash for a dividend hike. Cisco would have around $30 billion, including domestic cash on hand, for acquisitions. Cisco shares rose to a 17-year high.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersArista Networks handily beat Q4 earnings views with a 64% jump but revenue only edged estimates and its sales outlook for the March quarter and 2018 disappointed. Shares dived 19% Friday after a 200% run-up the past year. Management forecast a sequential revenue decline in the March quarter, with the mid-point of revenue guidance implying 37% growth to $459 million, just above estimates of $457 million. Analysts said Arista set the expectation for ""mid-20s"" revenue growth in 2018 which is below the Street's 27.5%. The guidance could reflect stiffer competition from Cisco.Shopify (SHOP) earned 15 cents a share in Q4, up from no profit a year earlier, vs. estimates of 5 cents. Revenue jumped 71% to $222.8 million, topping consensus estimates of $208 million. The e-commerce software firm forecast Q1 and 2018 revenue above expectations. Shares edged up Thursday after surging to a record high ahead of earnings. Shopify surged 15% through Thursday.RELATED:New America: Shopify Is Killing It By Making Businesses Win OnlineFacebook (FB) is losing younger users to Snap (SNAP)-owned Snapchat at an even faster pace than previously expected, said research firm eMarketer. It said Facebook is still adding monthly users overall, but older age groups are mainly responsible for the increase. Facebook will lose 2 million users under 25 in the U.S. this year while Snapchat will add 1.9 million, eMarketer predicts. Facebook's Instagram will still add teens and young adults.Shares of China internet companies Weibo (WB) and parent Sina (SINA) both reported fourth-quarter results that largely topped estimates. Weibo is a social media company that has a Twitter (TWTR)-like platform, while Sina offers a popular internet portal. Internet search leader Baidu (BIDU) also jumped on a fourth-quarter report that topped views, thanks to upside from online video and news feed advertising.RELATED:These Top China Names Are Trying To Form BasesDiamondback Energy (FANG) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) reported Q4 results above Wall Street estimates and plan to boost production this year as the International Energy Agency said U.S. crude output will overtake Saudi Arabia ""soon"" and ""catch up to Russia by the end of the year."" The Energy Information Administration said domestic oil production edged up to 10.27 million barrels per day from 10.25 million the prior week. OPEC sees global demand growth increasing by 60,000 bpd to 1.59 million, but expects U.S. production growth to outpace demand growth. Saudi Arabia called for production cuts by OPEC and Russia to continue through 2018. That, along with a stock market revival and a weak dollar, helped lift crude by 4.2% to $61.68 a barrel.The consumer price index and core CPI rose more than expected, pushing the 10-year Treasury above 2.9%, hitting fresh four-year highs. But core inflation is still just 1.8%. Markets priced in greater certainty of three Federal Reserve rate hikes in 2018, but still only about a 25% chance of a fourth hike. Meanwhile, January retail sales fell 0.3%, leading economists to mark down expectations for first-quarter GDP growth.Bitcoin continued on its upward trajectory, moving just above $10,000 afterfter briefly undercutting the $6,000 mark in the prior week. Meanwhile, Litecoin vaulted  as anticipation builds for the launch of payment processor LitePay and an upcoming fork of its blockchain. Meanwhile IBM (IBM) warned Congress about overregulating digital currencies in case it has ""unintended consequences"" on blockchain technology.LogMeIn (LOGM) reported adjusted Q4 earnings that beat estimates while pro forma revenue topped views. For 2018, LogMeIn forecast profit of $5.48 a share, well above estimates of $4.90 a share but its March quarter and full-year revenue outlooks were a bit light. LogMeIn sold Xively, its Internet of Things business for web-connected devices, to Google for $50 million. LogMeIn completed a reverse merger with the GoToMeeting business of Citrix (CTXS) on Feb. 1, 2017. Shares, which had broken out earlier in the week, fell 8.5% on Friday, undercutting its buy point.Chipotle Mexican Grill said Brian Niccol, CEO of Taco Bell, would become the fast-casual chain's chief executive in March. Shares sprinted higher on hopes Niccol — known for helping bring hits like Nacho Fries and Doritos Locos Tacos to Taco Bell's menu — might revive Chipotle's sales and traffic following food-safety issues.Meanwhile, Restaurant Brands International (QSR) said Burger King turned out strong Q4 sales, and the company more than doubled its dividend. Shake Shack (SHAK) said that by 2020, it planned to more than double its store count from last year's levels, while Q4 results beat views. But Shake Shack tumbled Friday on its guidance.Wyndham Worldwide (WYN), Marriott International (MAR), Hilton (HLT) and Hyatt (H) all reported quarterly results that topped expectations.HubSpot (HUBS) swung to a fourth-quarter profit as revenue jumped 39% to $106.5 million.. The Web marketing softward firm gave March quarter and full-year guidance above estimates. CFO John Kinzer will leave at the end of 2018. Shares shot up 16%.RingCentral (RNG) earned  7 cents a share in Q4, with revenue rising 34% to $140.5 million vs. estimates of 6 cents and $137 million. The cloud-based business communications software maker forecast 2018 adjusted earnings well above expectations. RingCentral leapt 21%.General Dynamics (GD) will buy defense IT contractor CSRA (CSRA) for $6.8 billion plus $2.8 billion in assumed debt as the military contractor looks to increase its IT services for the Defense Department in the wake of increased defense spending.SolarEdge (SEDG) shares vaulted 43% after reporting fourth-quarter earnings that beat and guided materially above the consensus estimate, while SunPower shares fell on disappointing earnings with a first-quarter revenue outlook below expectations.NetApp (NTAP) beat quarterly earnings that beat views but gave commentary that implied a reduction in gross margins. NetApp fell 5% Thursday and 2% Friday, but closed the week up a fraction.Shares in cybersecurity firms Qualys (QLYS) and Mimecast (MIME) climbed on better-than-expected earnings. Qualys forecast March quarter profit above views. The company is investing in product marketing and sales capacity. Mimecast, an email security specialist, upped fiscal 2018 revenue guidance. CyberArk (CYBR) topped Q4 revenue and EPS views as it closed larger deals. CyberArk forecast in-line March quarter sales but EPS below estimates.Chip-gear maker Applied Materials (AMAT) delivered better-than-expected fiscal first quarter sales and earnings, guided estimates higher for the current quarter, doubled its quarterly dividend and announced a new $6 billion share repurchase plan. Shares rose more than 14% for the week.Universal Display (OLED), a provider of technology and materials for OLED displays, signed new long-term supply and license agreements with major customer Samsung. Shares rose 8%.Groupon (GRPN) saw EPS rise 33% to four cents in the fourth quarter, missing estimates, as revenue fell 7% to $873 million, beating views.

792,ADS,"The clamor is rising for Big Tech firms to be broken up. With Amazon and Alphabet, Google's parent company, reporting record profits, voices from both the political left and the right have called for the firms to be broken up using antitrust law. Both sides claim these companies use data they collect from customers to keep themselves big and powerful.X At first glance, digital markets do seem fairly concentrated in just a few companies. Facebook owns the top three social media apps: Facebook, WhatsApp, and Messenger, all of which exceed 1 billion unique monthly active users. The company captures 20.9% of total U.S. digital ad revenue, putting it only behind Alphabet's 42.2%. And given the fast growth rate of Amazon, this looks like it is only a matter of time before the three control the entire market.Viewing these numbers in perspective, however, makes the picture a lot more complicated.Apple's native iMessage service, which does not show up in social media download statistics, shows much higher user engagement than Facebook Messenger, especially among younger demographics. Facebook is actually competing in messaging with a company whose interface it depends upon to gain access — and Facebook is losing.Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!This reveals one of the difficulties in seeing who is competing against whom online. Facebook competes not only against other social media sites like Snap, but also against the likes of Google, Apple, and Microsoft in various domains. Online competition requires the firm to provide for a variety of user demands — or cede ground to rival startups. Unless a firm like Apple can provide a messaging service that its users enjoy, it would allow Facebook to gain ground, which weakens the long-term prospects of Apple's business.These ""platform wars"" mean that competition between tech giants takes place over many different products and services, at various tiers. To understand the level of concentration properly, one cannot specify the market too narrowly. While Snapchat has less than one third of Instagram's users, those under the age of 25 use Snapchat much more heavily.Taking a snapshot of one moment does not tell you about how demographics will affect market position in the next. The competition is fierce. Today's startups are tomorrow's giants, just like Facebook and Amazon once were — and not very long ago.That means the current market positions of Big Tech firms are inherently unstable, despite the best efforts of these firms to prepare for the future. Facebook's attempt to kill off Snapchat with its Camera app is now regarded as a failure, as is Google's attempt to kill Facebook with Google Plus, and Amazon's attempt to branch into mobile with the Fire phone.Having lots of data and users is not enough for these companies to branch out into new territories. If platforms fail to develop ecosystems that adapt to user demands, they can fall from seemingly dominant positions rapidly — as recent history amply demonstrates.When the competitive pressure on these firms is put into perspective, they look less dominant. Amazon currently makes 2.5% of U.S. digital ad revenue compared to Alphabet and Facebook's near 70%, but looking at total U.S. ad revenue shows these firms together make only 20%.Just consider that if tech giants are increasing their revenues to the detriment of newspapers, it still exaggerates the concentration to neglect newspapers' print ads entirely. It is also possible that some recent decisions, such as Facebook's news feed changes, will drive away users in the long-term. This is a dynamic market.One thing, however, is perfectly clear. Consumers are by and large happy with their services. None of the Big 5 tech companies (Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, and Facebook) have below a 60% approval rating. The companies may be large, but competition among them is as fierce as ever, allowing them to consistently innovate and provide consumers with new and better services.Breaking up big technology companies in an attempt to force ""competition"" (according to a model developed in the pre-tech, 20th Century economy), without a clear understanding of the current market dynamics and the impact on consumers themselves, would leave their users worse off. And these days, that means all of us.You Might Also Like...The Anti-Innovation Peril Of Global Antitrust'Do No Evil': Should Big-Tech Malefactors Be Taken Down By Antitrust?A Tale Of Two Decisions: Trump Administration Got Antitrust Wrong, But Net Neutrality RightClick here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

But Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB), run by Warren Buffett, announced it bought 18.9 million Teva shares in the fourth quarter.SolarEdge vaulted higher on blowout earnings.

But a gap-up stock gain Thursday would give the RS line a big boost.SolarEdge is in a third-stage base. Late-stage bases are less likely to deliver big winners than early-stage breakouts.TripAdvisor reported a sharper profit decline than expected. But the online travel site beat on revenue, gave bullish guidance and announced a $250 million stock buyback. Shares surged 18% early Thursday to 48.10. That suggests a move above a 46.07 bottoming base at Thursday's open.But breakouts from bases that largely form below their 200-day line are more prone to failure.

795,ADS,"Analysts weren't surprised Wednesday after Dow's Merck (MRK) terminated a late-stage study of a potential Alzheimer's disease drug and argued that it won't have implications for Biogen (BIIB) which announced an expansion to a key Alzheimer's trial, but Biogen shares fell anyway.X Late Wednesday, after its shares slid as much as 9.1%, Biogen announced it would enroll 510 more patients to the original recruitment plan for its Phase 3 aducanumab trials. Enrollment is still expected to be complete by mid-2018, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note to clients.Biogen's news follows Merck's decision late Tuesday to scrap a study of a drug called verubecestat in patients with early-stage Alzheimer's disease. Verubecestat is known as a BACE inhibitor and aims to prevent the buildup of amyloid plaques in the brain associated with Alzheimer's.""In the context of Merck's recent disappointment with the Merck BACE inhibitor verubecestat, Biogen's aducanumab is one of what is now only a handful of Alzheimer's medicines still active in pivotal trials,"" Porges said.Merck halted a late-stage trial of verubecestat this time last year when investigators found it had ""virtually no chance"" of working in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's. Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said the failure was a disappointment, but not surprising.""We remained hopeful that the drug would potentially show some benefit if given to patients earlier in the course of the disease,"" he said in a note to clients. ""We now remove all verubecestat revenues from our model.""Divan cut his price target on Merck to 65 from 66, though he kept his outperform rating. Merck will likely have to seek out mergers big enough to ""move the needle"" on a $150 billion market cap company with annual sales north of $40 billion.""The rest of the business is not strong enough to allow for the growth they are seeing in oncology to come through,"" he said. ""While today's news was not unexpected, we do believe it adds incremental pressure on Merck to pursue business development opportunities to bring additional growth drivers into their mid-late-stage pipeline.""IBD'S TAKE: The 50-day moving average can be used to pinpoint times of opportunity or risk in stocks. How? Head to the Investor's Corner for more tips on smart stock buying and selling tips.Evercore analyst Umer Raffat points out ""any failure in the (Alzheimer's) space is never good news."" Others including Biogen/Eisai, Eli Lilly (LLY)/AstraZeneca (AZN), Novartis (NVS) and Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) are also working on BACE inhibitors.Biogen's aducanumab works differently from the BACE inhibitors. It aims to remove plaque buildup in the brain. Analysts are particularly hopeful for the prospects of aducanumab.""If you look at the actual amount of amyloid plaque reduction with BACE inhibitors, it's dramatically less than what Biogen saw with aducanumab,"" Raffat said in a report. ""This plaque reduction on aducanumab is by the far the most important thing going in Biogen's favor.""RBC analyst Brian Abrahams is more bullish on aducanumab than Biogen/Eisai's BACE inhibitor, elenbecestat.""Though aducanumab also targets beta-amyloid, we would not necessarily make direct read-throughs from failure of a BACE inhibitor to a beta-amyloid targeting monoclonal antibody,"" he said. ""We believe the unknowns about the beta-amyloid hypothesis are already baked into Biogen shares.""On the stock market today, Biogen tumbled 6.6% to close at 296.08. Merck was unchanged at 54.90.RELATED:These Biotechs Could Spring Back After Market Correction: AnalystBiotech Investors Flee In Droves As Market Correction Rocks The GroupThis Biotech Stock Rocketed On An Immuno-Oncology Tie With Bristol

It's performed well after paying a visit to the 50-day moving average Friday. Facebook (FB) lost more than 1.8% after finding support at the 200-day moving average Friday.The Nasdaq notched its third straight gain, rising nearly 0.5%. It's getting closer to the 50-day moving average near 7,081, a potential resistance level to watch. The S&P 500 added 0.3% and the Dow gained 0.2%. Preliminary data showed volume on both exchanges coming in lower than Monday's levels.At the New York Mercantile Exchange, March U.S. crude oil futures eased 0.2% to $59.19 a barrel after the International Energy Agency raised its global demand growth outlook. The 10-year Treasury yield, meanwhile, eased 3 basis points to 2.82%.In the stock market today, AmerisourceBergen (ABC) jumped 9.3% after a report in the Wall Street Journal said Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) is interested in buying the drug distributor. The news comes on the heels of the proposed merger between CVS Health (CVS) and Aetna (AET) announced late last year.Inside the IBD 50, Weibo (WB) was the star of the day, soaring 9.7% on strong earnings. It was a muscular move, but Weibo recently flashed a sell signal from a handle entry at 122.31 as well as an alternate entry at 123.10. Note that its latest breakout was from a later-stage base. The company operates a social-media platform in China.Sina (SINA), which spun off Weibo in 2014 but remains a majority shareholder, jumped 6%, also on solid earnings.Elsewhere, after a failed breakout over a 52.97 cup-with-handle buy point, IBD 50 name HealthEquity (HQY) is still in buy range from a new handle entry at 52.53. Note that HealthEquity still has its recent high to contend with at 55.31.RingCentral (RNG) turned out to be a good earnings option play as shares jumped 7%. Late Monday, the enterprise software name reported another quarter of triple-digit earnings growth, along with a 34% increase in sales to $140.5 million.When shares were trading around 53.25 on Monday, a monthly call option with a 55 strike price (Feb. 16 expiration) came with a premium of around 1.40, presenting a trade with downside risk of 2.6% (1.40/53.25). One contract gave the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy 100 shares of RingCentral at 55 for a cost of around $140. If the company's earnings had disappointed, the most that could've been lost on a one-contract trade was $140, the amount paid for the contract.RELATED:Weibo Earnings, Revenue Top; Parent Sina Reports Strong Top-Line GrowthMarket-Leading Cisco, Hotel Earnings On Tap, But Inflation Data Key: Investing Action Plan Twitter Short Sellers Keep Increasing Stakes Even As Stock Rises

798,ADS,"The popular Super Bowl commercial laid out a tongue-in-cheek crisis in the future of AI. Amazon.com's (AMZN) digital assistant Alexa loses her voice. What to do in a world dependent on artificial intelligence in business and at home?X Enter a series of stand-ins, including actor Anthony Hopkins, who goes into creepy Hannibal Lecter mode and unnerves the people he's supposed to help. Thankfully, Alexa recovers her digital voice and restores order. AI proves its value.Corporate America is on the cusp of a plunge into this future of AI in business. And giant technology companies — which stand to benefit by both harnessing their own artificial intelligence applications and helping other companies make the leap — are immersed in it now.Artificial intelligence innovations are well along at Amazon, Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). Alexa, found on Amazon's Echo devices, is just one example. Digital aides like Google's aptly named Assistant on its Home smart speaker and Apple's Siri on its Home Pod can help with shopping, entertainment, school work and other tasks.Tech companies also are busy at work on deploying AI in self-driving cars. And companies ranging from giant IBM (IBM) and Oracle (ORCL) to a wave of startups are competing for talent and technology so they can cash in as AI spreads to non-tech enterprises.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportOutside Silicon Valley, companies are dipping a tentative toe into AI. Surveys show that most companies plan to evaluate how artificial intelligence can make them better, whether in making sales forecasts, automating tasks now done manually, improving existing products or enabling new ones. Budgets could more than triple in the next few years.""There's a lot of interest and experimentation; companies are still in the proof-of-concept, project phase,"" said Nicholas McQuire, vice president of enterprise research at CCS Insight. ""We'll see more deployment in about one or two years.""Artificial intelligence software programs — essentially computer algorithms — analyze huge amounts of data to identify patterns and predict outcomes.Companies are developing AI software that could save lives through early cancer detection. Other projects might someday thwart a cyberattack.Banking, retail and health care are among the sectors pushing into AI with pilot projects. Conversational ""chat bots"" are popping up on company websites, answering questions and improving customer service.Walmart Stores (WMT) harnesses AI to optimize inventories and supply chains by predicting future demand and reordering stock. Monsanto (MON) uses artificial intelligence to identify the most promising molecules in bioengineering. John Deere (DE) expects AI to reduce chemical spraying volumes in farming. And shale oil producer Devon Energy (DVN) uses AI to guide drilling gear.IBD's Take: The so-called FANG stocks are leading the way in AI in consumer apps and cloud computing. Learn more about Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google at IBD's FANG stocks news page. To keep up to date on the latest in artificial intelligence, bookmark our AI trends and news page.There's more. Banks see the future of AI in detecting money laundering and fraud. Manufacturers see AI as helpful in scheduling equipment maintenance. In health care, AI could predict diabetes and other diseases before they develop and identify the most promising treatments. A new algorithm from Google can help predict heart disease via retinal scans.In e-commerce, marketers expect AI tools to personalize website content to spotlight products or services that each online shopper is most likely to buy and to target ads more effectively. The telecom, oil and gas, media, entertainment and agriculture industries also are expected to embrace AI in their business.""A lot of companies see AI as transformational, but maybe not quite yet,"" said Jeff Cotrupe, an analyst at Frost & Sullivan.Industry disruptions and AI-based business models are off in the future.""The enterprise has been a bit slow,"" said Aditya Kaul, research director at Tractica. ""Many companies are still in the early stages of understanding what is AI, what problems can be solved, what is possible.""IDC forecasts that worldwide spending on AI hardware, software and services will jump to $58 billion by 2021, up from just $12 billion in 2017.""AI is not a budget line-item at this stage,"" said CCS's McQuire.JPMorgan estimates that AI will account for 1.8% of global enterprise IT budgets by 2021. Though still small next to, say, the 8% spent on cybersecurity, that would be up from a scant 0.3% in 2016.An AI spending boom would boost growth at enterprise software firms, cloud computing providers and IT service providers such as Microsoft, IBM, Accenture (ACN), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Oracle.""The AI killer app has emerged: cost savings,"" Brent Bracelin, a KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst, said in a recent note to clients. Aside from customer service, he says many time-consuming, back-office tasks  such as human resources, finance and accounting will be automated with AI.One key to the future of AI will be to make it easier for companies to forge ahead with artificial intelligence projects, say analysts. Salesforce.com, AT&T (T) and Google are among those seeking a faster track for AI in business.AT&T, with an open-source software project, aims to make developing AI predictive tools as easy as building a website.  Working with IT consulting firm Tech Mahindra, AT&T has launched an open-source artificial intelligence software project with the Linux Foundation.""There is some confusion that doing AI is very expensive if you look at the R&D budgets of Google and Amazon,"" said Kaul. ""But you don't need billions of dollars to get AI projects started. There is open source software — it's a big trend within AI — that helps companies build their own solutions.""Salesforce.com has a mantra to help customers build AI tools ""with clicks not code."" That means companies don't need their own programmers to write algorithms that can find patterns or make inferences from sales data.Salesforce has a line of tools it calls Einstein that use a company's historical lead and account data to predict which deals are more likely to close.""What companies need is the ability to apply AI to their business. There's not a lot of off-the-shelf AI, like Salesforce's Einstein,"" said CCS Insight's McQuire. ""But technology is advancing quickly. We're going to see a lot more technology that helps companies automate the creation of custom AI models, which will speed up the market.""McQuire says nearly 60% of companies surveyed by CCS Insight are testing or studying AI. One problem is that high-tech companies are willing to pay much higher salaries for AI specialists, which increases their expenses.If they lack in-house expertise, McQuire says many companies are turning to cloud computing vendors — Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google — to get a head start.Cloud computing vendors aim to provide AI-as-a-service. Companies can run artificial intelligence apps on powerful computers rented by the hour to crunch massive quantities of data.""All the public clouds are fighting over who has the best AI platform,"" said Jason Ader, a William Blair analyst, in a report.Google is focused on providing cloud customers with tool kits for ""machine learning,"" one type of AI. Google's AI tools enable cloud customers such as a hospital radiology department to focus computer vision algorithms so they can spot lung cancer.Many midsize or large companies lack internal technology staffers who can build AI-powered apps. That gives information technology services firms such as Accenture and IBM an opening as companies look to develop custom AI apps, says Bhavan Suri, analyst at William Blair. IBM, which has focused its Watson AI platform on health care, is moving into new markets such as digital marketing.Wall Street analysts anticipate that AI tools will be integrated with existing big data, business intelligence and industry-specific enterprise software. Kaul says many industries are still in the early stages of digitizing records handled as paperwork. Once that data is available, AI tools can go to work to help deploy AI in business.""Although Google, Facebook (FB), Baidu (BIDU), Apple, Microsoft and Amazon may have taken early advantage of their large data sets and established platforms, enterprise  software vendors like SAP, Oracle, and Salesforce are gradually embedding AI into their offerings,"" said the JPMorgan report.Software companies pushing into AI include Adobe Systems (ADBE), Tableau Software (DATA), Zendesk (ZEN), Coupa Software (COUP), Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD), HubSpot (HUBS), Splunk (SPLK) and Workday (WDAY).The fact that most non-tech companies need a helping hand getting into artificial intelligence also provides an opportunity for startups pushing into the enterprise market. Among them: Sentient Technologies, DataRobot, Clarifai, Algorithmia, Affectiva and SpaceKnow.At this early stage of AI in business, corporate America is using what's called ""machine learning"" for the most part as opposed to more complex ""deep learning."" With ML, algorithms are trained to create predictive models or identify patterns. ML helps predict what a particular customer is likely to buy or detects insurance claims fraud.Tech companies use machine learning to personalize web content and other tasks. But they also are plowing ahead in applying deep learning, which mimics neural networks in the human brain, for classifying images and other purposes. Self-driving cars will require deep learning to map their surroundings and detect hazards.Technology giants are in an AI arms race. They're funding or acquiring startups and paying super-salaries to hire AI computer scientists.Amazon isn't stopping at Alexa-powered digital assistants. Its Amazon Go retail stores use computer vision and AI to do away with cashiers.Apple uses artificial intelligence software for facial recognition in the new iPhone X. And Apple is developing AI health care mobile apps.For Facebook users, AI lurks behind the scenes, playing a central role in what advertisements or news they see. And at Netflix (NFLX), programming recommendations are getting better as software algorithms are trained to identify movie matches.What sets the tech giants apart is commitment. For them, the future of AI is now.Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai makes a point to show this. On earnings calls and tech conferences, he now calls Google an ""AI first"" company.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Is It Time To Get Into — Or Out Of — The Stock Market?No. 1-Ranked Stock With 118% Growth Breaks Out With Earnings DueBirth Of An Industry: Early Investing  Hot Spots In Artificial IntelligenceIt's An AI Arms Race: What China Has To Offer Vis-A-Vis U.S.

That crushed Wall Street estimates by 46 cents according to Zacks Investment Research. Martin Marietta Materials sales rose 2.5% vs. a year earlier to $911 million, but that failed to meet expectations for $913 million.The fourth-quarter results included a one-time, noncash benefit of $258.1 million related to the Trump administration's tax reform.Martin Marietta rose 2.6% to 218.35 on the stock market today, near session lows after hitting 229.66 intraday. The stock did close above its 200-day moving average but ended just below its 50-day after vaulting above that key level. The stock has a composite rating of 55, however its EPS rating of 84 is more impressive. The firm is ranked third in the Building-Cement, Concrete And Aggregates Group, which is led by Loma Negra (LOMA).Martin Marietta's performance was hit by delays in Texas Department of Transportation projects and a slow down in railroad ballast shipments. In addition abnormally wet weather conditions, the Hurricane Matthew and a slower energy-related marketplace.IBD'S TAKE: By learning to use call options, investors can significantly reduce risk and capitalize on basing stocks that are making breakaway gains caused by earnings reports.However the firm, which has a $14 billion market cap, has improved cost management and operational efficiency.For 2018 it expects full-year revenue of $4.16 billion to $4.36 billion, above Wall Street forecasts for $4.078 billion.Ward Nye, chairman and CEO of Martin Marietta, was bullish.""Our ability to post record results despite these external factors, among them extraordinary weather events, contractor labor constraints, and a slower-than-expected pace of public contract lettings, validates the successful execution of our strategic plan and underpins our optimism for a steady and extended cyclical recovery as we begin 2018,"" Nye said. ""Our confidence in our 2018 outlook is particularly strengthened by positive fourth-quarter trends.""The Building-Cement, Concrete And Aggregates Group is ranked 143 out of all the 197 groups monitored by IBD.The Trump administration this week proposed for a huge jump in infrastructure spending, though it's unclear if Congress will approve the planVulcan Materials (VMC) rose 1.7% and U.S. Concrete (USCR) 1.8%.Loma Negra climbed 0.6%.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Trump Seeks Mulligan On Fiscal Restraint, Starting With Infrastructure Homebuilder Stocks To Watch And Housing Market NewsEarnings Calendar, Analyst Estimates And Stocks To Watch

806,ADS,"Domestic oil stockpiles plunged last week, while production bounced back from a prior dip, according to a report Thursday, after OPEC showed concern about U.S. output growth in its monthly oil market report.X The Energy Information Administration said crude inventories fell by 6.9 million barrels, while gasoline stocks rose by 3.6 million barrels.Late Wednesday, the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, reported a 5.1 million-barrel drop in weekly stockpiles with gasoline stockpiles up 1.8 million.  Analysts polled by S&P Global Platts expected a 425,000-barrel drop in oil inventories and a 2.7 million-barrel increase in gasoline stockpiles.U.S. production rose to 9.75 million barrels a day, according to EIA, nearly recouping the prior week's drop to 9.49 million from 9.78 million.Brent crude futures fell 0.1% to $69.31 per barrel. U.S. crude dropped 2 cents to $63.95 a barrel. Both are still at the highest levels since 2015.Dow Jones industrial component Exxon Mobil (XOM) slid 0.65% on the stock market today. Fellow Dow stock Chevron (CVX) retreated 0.6%. BP (BP) rose 2 cents and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) was down 0.2%.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Earlier, OPEC's forecast for U.S. output growth this year was revised up by 110,000 barrels per day to 820,000 bpd, as higher crude prices encourage an increase in conventional production.Total non-OPEC supply is now seen rising by 1.2 million bpd, up 160,000 bpd from its previous estimate.OPEC said U.S. shale producers lowered break-even costs between 2015 and 2017 but now service companies are raising rig and labor costs so break-even prices are rising. Despite increased costs, OPEC cited a JPMorgan report that found U.S. shale exploration and production companies could achieve ""decent rates of return"" at $60 per barrel even if costs rose by another 15%.OPEC and Russian officials will meet in Oman Sunday for a joint ministerial monitoring committee to determine how closely countries are adhering to a production deal to remove 1.8 million bpd from the market.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Dividend Hikes, Largest IPO Ever Lead 5 Oil Stories To Watch This YearEnergy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, Coal

808,ADS,"Dow component Merck (MRK) surged to a three-month high Tuesday as the company did an about-face and reported strong results for its immuno-oncology and chemotherapy treatments for lung cancer a year ahead of expectations, casting the shares of rivals downward.X In a trial known as Keynote-189, Merck's Keytruda drug plus chemotherapy was tested as a first treatment in patients with advanced lung cancer, and safety proved consistent with earlier studies, Merck said in a news release. Specific results will be presented at a future medical conference, the company said.""Keynote-189 showed significant improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival for patients receiving Keytruda in the first-line setting in combination with traditional chemotherapy, compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone,"" Dr. Roger M. Perlmutter, president of Merck Research Laboratories, said in a written statement.The news comes just three months after Merck said it would delay unveiling the results of the trial until February 2019. In the October announcement, it added overall survival as a key goal of the trial.At the time, shares took a 17-month dive. Analysts suggested there could be problems with the Phase 3 trial. But on Tuesday, those concerns were alleviated when Merck said its regimen ""significantly improved"" overall survival and progression-free survival in advanced lung cancer.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Merck surged 5.8% to close at 62.07, touching an intraday high last seen before it announced the delay in late October.The results solidify Merck's status as the leader in the race for market share in first-line advanced lung cancer, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a note to clients. There, it competes with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Roche (RHHBY) and AstraZeneca (AZN).Roche tested a combination of immuno-oncology drug Tecentriq with chemotherapy and an older cancer drug called Avastin. The regimen doubled the percentage of lung cancer patients who survived a year without disease progression, Roche said in December.IBD'S TAKE: Merck has an IBD Composite Rating of 37 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it performs in the bottom half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics, lagging leaders like AbbVie with a CR of 95. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at other strong pharma stocks.Bristol is also set to unveil the results of a trial of its immuno-oncology drugs Opdivo and Yervoy as a first therapy in advanced lung cancer. AstraZeneca is also testing its immuno-oncology drugs Imfinzi and tremelimumab in the same type of patients.Shares of Bristol toppled 4.6% to close at 59.92, while Roche dove 3.4% to finish at 30.68. AstraZeneca sloughed off 1.9% to 34.99.The specific immuno-oncology drugs used in these trials vary. Keytruda and Opdivo are known as PD-1 inhibitors. Evercore analyst Umer Raffat says PD-1 inhibitors plus chemo are now ""the bar to beat"" for any potential immuno-oncology regimens in development.Raffat notes Merck's success in Keynote-189 will likely ensure the regimen's approval in Europe. The regimen already has accelerated approval in the U.S. pending confirmatory trials. Keynote-198 results could prompt further use, he said in a note to clients.""We had picked up feedback from doctors that they wanted to see confirmation of the Phase 2 data before more widespread use,"" he said. ""With this press release out there plus a likely presentation at a medical conference, it makes us more comfortable with the acceleration modeled in consensus on U.S. Keytruda through the balance of the year.""The consensus is modeling $755 million in fourth-quarter sales of Keytruda in the U.S. It sees $824.4 million, $895.3 million, $914.4 million and $1.05 billion in the respective 2018 quarters for U.S. Keytruda sales.RELATED:Roche's Cancer Drug Combo Effective For Some — But Shares DropWhy Roche Cancer Trial Is Kick In Teeth For Dow Stock MerckDow's Merck Plunges To 17-Month Low On Growing Keytruda Worries

811,ADS,"Major stock indexes turned negative in late-afternoon trading Tuesday, not a surprise given the ebullient gains during the first two weeks of trading in 2018.X The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 both showed losses of around 0.4% to 0.5% after rising as much as 1% and 0.8%, respectively. The 500 breached 2800 for the first time. The Dow Jones industrial average eased 0.2% after rising as much as 1.1% in the early going.At one point, at least nine of the 30 components in the Dow industrials advanced 1 point or more, By around 3 p.m. ET, however, only three stocks in the Dow were up 1 point or more, and all three hailed from the health care arena: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Merck (MRK) and UnitedHealth (UNH).Merck gapped up nearly 6% to 62.07 in quadruple normal turnover on good news regarding a potential treatment involving Keytruda with two additional medicines for lung cancer. For now, Merck continues to be in base-building mode.Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was running sharply higher vs. the same time on Friday.Meanwhile, Bitcoin and other alternative digital currencies continued to cool off. Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) gave back most of Friday's rebound, losing 10% to 1,763. However, the overall picture of the fast-rising exchange-traded note has not changed. It's been in a normal correction since peaking at 3,523 on Dec. 19, and Tuesday marks the start of a fifth week of digesting the superlative gains seen in the fourth quarter of last year.On Nov. 22, Bitcoin Investment Trust broke out of a very deep cup with handle at 985.10 and roared more than 257% higher in less than a month. On a daily chart, one can see that Bitcoin Investment is trying to halt its slide at the 50-day moving average.Crude oil prices and copper eased too, while gold prices rose on the back of a weaker U.S. dollar. The euro last week moved past $1.22 for the first time since December 2015. WTI near-term futures edged 0.7% lower to $63.88 a barrel.Market breadth turned negative in U.S. equities, with losing stocks outmatching winners by nearly 2-to-1 on both exchanges.A few leading stocks let their strong gains slip. Weibo (WB) moved past a 122.31 buy point in a seven-week cup with handle and rallied to as high as 128.37, up 4.9% past the proper entry. But the stock backtracked to cut its gain to roughly 1%.The decline within Weibo's cup base runs from 123 on the left-side peak to 97.49, a correction of 20.7%. That's within the normal parameters for this important chart pattern for investors on the hunt for strong breakouts. However, the most recent base is late stage, which increases the risk of failure.The Chinese social network broke out of a first-stage base at 19.20, also a cup with handle, during the week ended April 8, 2016.Weibo was initially featured in the IBD Stock Analysis column on March 24, 2016. It also became the 10th current stock on IBD Leaderboard on Tuesday, joining fellow Chinese ADRs Autohome (ATHM) and 58.com (WUBA).Weibo wasn't alone in terms of top-rated companies starting the MLK holiday-shortened trading week on a sour note.LGI Homes (LGIH) fell more than 8% to 69.53 and triggered one sell signal as volume jumped 125% above its 50-day average. The stock posted its biggest point drop since breaking out of a solid seven-week cup base at 50.05 on Oct. 2. Tuesday's drop was also the largest since the entry-level homebuilder cleared an earlier, deeper cup base at 40.57 in late June 2017.Shares in LGI are now testing institutional buying support at the critical 50-day moving average.Lithium metal supplier Sociedad Quimica (SQM), NetEase (NTES), New Oriental Education (EDU) and streaming video hardware play Roku (ROKU) also staged negative reversals in heavy or increasing volume. Such concerted selling hinted at some pronounced profit-taking among mutual funds, hedge funds, banks, insurers, large investment advisors and the like.Stay abreast of future potential changes in the overall market trend by reading The Big Picture column each day.Amid the broad market reversal, a few highly-rated names still acted well.Oneok (OKE) gained for a fourth day in a row, rising more than 1.3% to 59.45 in above-average turnover. The oil and gas transport play has cleared a 16-week cup pattern at 56.19 and is slightly outside the proper buy range. The 5% buy zone goes up to 59.00. Buying too far extended in price puts an investor in a vulnerable spot as a stock can quickly pull back and test the initial entry following a strong move up.Wall Street expects the Oklahome-based firm to stage a strong rebound in earnings in 2018, up 34% to $2.25 a share following a 1% climb in 2017. Fourth-quarter results are likely to be announced in late February.Oneok also sports a 5.1% annualized dividend yield.Abiomed (ABMD), the heart pump maker and one of 15 names in IBD Sector Leaders screen, rose more than 1.2% to 217.74 in slightly above-average turnover. The market leader is extended after surpassing a narrow flat base at 200.38 on Jan. 5.Abiomed scores a lofty 98 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup.Grubhub (GRUB), No. 23 in the IBD 50, is off around 0.7% yet remains above the key 50-day moving average following a two-day rebound on Thursday and Friday. Continued support at the 50-day line, or 10-week moving average on a weekly chart, would give investors a chance to add to a current position in the mobile and online food ordering service.Grubhub is up 21% since clearing a 57.71 buy point in a six-week flat base on Oct. 25 following robust third-quarter results (earnings up 22% to 28 cents a share, revenue up 32% to a record $163.1 million).

812,ADS,"Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) could successfully compete with larger rivals Amgen (AMGN), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) in preventing chronic migraines, a pair of analysts said Tuesday.X The comments come in the wake of Alder's results last week of a Phase 3 trial in chronic migraines in which more than 60% of patients saw a reduction in days where they're afflicted with migraines. The company also said it resolved a patent dispute over its drug, eptinezumab, with Teva and found $250 million in equity financing.""Alder is turning things around in 2018,"" Needham analyst Danielle Brill said in a note to clients. She has a buy rating and a 26 price target on the stock.Despite the bullish note, Alder toppled 5.3% to close at 16.90 on the stock market today. Shares rocketed 36% over two days after Alder revealed the results of its Phase 3 eptinezumab trial on Jan. 8. The stock broke out of a cup formation at a 13.35 buy point on Jan. 3.Eptinezumab is being developed as an intravenous treatment to prevent chronic migraines. It belongs to a class of drugs called anti-CGRPs and competes against rival drugs from Amgen, Lilly and Teva.In the Phase 3 trial, 15% of patients treated with eptinezumab had no migraines for three months. A third of patients achieved a 75% or greater reduction in migraine days from baseline through month three, and 61% saw their migraine days cut in at least half over that time.""We believe the data also showcased intravenous eptinezumab's differentiated profile,"" Brill said. ""Rapidity of onset, and magnitude of benefit with intravenous eptinezumab were clearly distinguished from subcutaneous (injection) competitors' data.""IBD'S TAKE: Alder stock rose to an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 84 out of a best-possible 99 last week, though has since fallen to a 79. Visit IBD Data Stories for what goes into an RS Rating and what prompted Alder's spike.A specialist cited by Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan prefers the intravenous route for eptinezumab ""because it will lead to regular office visits by patients where he can monitor their progress and ensure proper compliance to therapy.""Alder is likely to be fourth to the market with an anti-CGRP, Divan said in a note to clients. Analysts had worried that would put Alder at a disadvantage to its larger rivals. But, like Needham's Brill, Divan sees eptinezumab as differentiated.Still, Alder and its rivals will face the same insurer obstacles and competition from likely less costly treatments like Allergan's (AGN) Botox, he said. In the U.S., about 40% of Botox sales come from use in chronic migraines.""Based on the cost of novel therapies, it is possible payers may push patients to try older (off-label) therapies as well as Botox before patients are given access to CGRP antibodies,"" Divan said. ""But over time we would assume new patients and patients who are not having satisfactory responses to Botox will move over to the CGRP antibodies.""Shares of Teva dove 3% to close at 21.41. Lilly dipped 1.9% to finish at 85.29. Amgen lost was up a fraction to close at 185.54.RELATED:Why Amgen Could Have An Edge Over These Rivals In Preventing MigrainesBiotechs Cruise On Upgrades, But Drugmakers Miss The BoatWhy This Biotech Suffered A 2-Day Headache On Rare-Disease Trial

The Nasdaq composite also gave back a healthy gain, falling 0.5%, while the S&P 500 gave back nearly 0.4%. Small caps underperformed with the Russell 2000 down 1%.Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in higher than Friday's levels in the stock market today, resulting in a distribution day for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Higher-volume declines haven't been an issue for the broad market in recent weeks, but it's always important to pay attention to signs of institutional selling when it arises, even when the percentage declines aren't severe.Money flowing out of stocks did not translate into bond inflows as the 10-year Treasury yield was mostly unchanged at 2.54%.Strong showings from Merck (MRK) and UnitedHealth (UNH) helped the Dow early. Shares of Merck gapped above the 200-day moving average, rising nearly 6%, after the company said a late-stage trial of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda, in combination with two chemotherapy treatments, was effective in treating patients with advanced lung cancer.Shares of UnitedHealth, meanwhile, gained 2% after the company reported earnings and gave a solid outlook for 2018.Wall Street also liked the look of quarterly results from Citigroup (C). Shares rose 0.4% to 77.18. It tried to clear a flat base with a 78.02 entry but came up short.Tuesday's session served up early breakouts from many top-rated growth names including IBD 50 names Atlassian (TEAM) and Align Technology (ALGN) as well as Weibo (WB), but all three names looked a lot like the major stock indexes by the close.Results from Atlassian are due Thursday after the close. Shares rose 0.5% to 52.82 ahead of the results. It cleared a 53.55 buy point but ended below the buy point.Shares of Weibo rose more than 1% to 123.19. It ended just above a 122.31 cup-with-handle buy point. Note that the handle is only visible on the daily chart, not the weekly, and the latest breakout was from a late-stage base.Align Technology also broke out early but closed with a whimper. Shares rose 2% to 263.88, closing just below a 266.51 entry.AbbVie (ABBV) turned in a solid performance after a recent breakout over a 98.36 buy point. Shares rose another 2% to 102.46.

823,ADS,"China's Cheetah Mobile (CMCM) is off to a fast start in 2018 after shaking up its board of directors late last year and adding Microsoft's (MSFT) voice-activated digital assistant to a mobile app.New York-listed shares in Cheetah Mobile soared by 11.2% Thursday to close at 16.94 on the stock market today, continuing its run-up.Cheetah Mobile on Dec. 28 added Michael Yao, chairman and chief executive of internet content firm 58.com (WUBA) to its board. Cheetah Mobile also named Michael Zuo of investment firm Matrix Partners to its board.Shares in 58.com, the so-called Craigslist of China, have surged 173% the past 12 months, though they retreated 1.7% to 81.87. 58.com is China's largest online market place for classifieds.Cheetah Mobile owns the Clean Master utility app for smartphones that use Google's Android software. Cheetah Mobile in early December added Microsoft's Cortana digital assistant tool to its CM Launcher app for Android. Analysts say it's the first time Microsoft's artificial intelligence technology has been deployed in an Android launcher app.IBD'S TAKE: Cheetah shares are extended after breaking out Jan. 4 from a cup-with-handle base that formed over the course of 201 days. Shares now are up 35% over their pivot point. The stock's Relative Strength rating from IBD now stands at 96 out of a possible 99 and the company is ranked fifth in the Computer Software-Security Group. Cheetah Mobile stock has been in the doldrums since hitting a high of 33.75 in June 2015.

825,ADS,"The Nasdaq composite is trading near session highs in late-afternoon trading Friday with a nearly 0.5% gain. The leading index in 2017, up 28.2% that year, looks poised to stage a third up week in a row. At 7316, the tech-centered index is up nearly 0.8% for the week.XThe Nasdaq rallied 3.4% and 1.7% in the first two trading weeks of 2018 in what is shaping up to be one of the strongest starts in recent years.Digital payments firms continue to lead the market upside. PayPal (PYPL), a member of the IBD 50, added another 0.8% to 83.63 in below-average trade and is now mildly extended past a 79.48 buy point in a third-stage flat base.PayPal had first broken out of a long saucer-like pattern around 44 in April 2017, rallied more than 37%, then built a narrow five-week flat base that produced a 55.24 entry. PayPal broke out of that second-stage base on July 10 and rallied nearly 44% before correcting quickly in price for two weeks in late November to early December.Great stocks have the ability to keep running higher even after forming two, three or even four bases. But such market leaders are rare, as noted in this column in IBD's Investor's Corner, a longtime feature dedicated to helping readers how to buy and sell stocks more profitably.Meanwhile, Google site operator Alphabet (GOOGL) has gotten off to a roaring start, at least among megacap names, in 2018. Shares are down slightly, yet the stock has now advanced 7.7% since Jan. 1.Apple (AAPL)  is up 5.5% since Jan. 1. The iPhone giant, though, has had a masterful run since breaking out of a first-stage cup with handle at 118.12 back on Jan. 6, 2017.More recently, Apple cleared a 106.97 entry in an eight-week cup with handle Oct. 27, just ahead of reporting robust quarterly results.Nevertheless, both stocks are acting in healthy fashion following recent breakouts. Alphabet has rolled nearly 13% since it cleared a 1,006.29 entry in a 10-week flat base on Oct. 11.At 3 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 rose 0.3% on the back of gains in meat, tobacco, truck, electronic parts, shoe retail, specialty retail and lodging shares. Breadth is positive on both exchanges. Winning issues are exceeding losers by a more than 2-1 margin on the Nasdaq and roughly 9-5 on the NYSE.The Dow Jones industrial average reversed from small losses to edge slightly higher. But IBM (IBM) is weighing on the Dow, sliding more than 7 points or 4% to 161.56 following a big gap up Wednesday. IBM, which has been struggling for years to post meaningful gains in the top line, is still in the early stages of building the right side of a bottoming base.An additional four of the 30 components in the Dow industrials, including American Express (AXP) and Visa (V), are down 1 point or more. Amex dropped more than 3% to 96.75 and is undercutting the key 50-day moving average in whale-like volume. It's the first time Amex has probed the medium-term support level since early September.The financial services powerhouse reported a net loss of $1.41 a share on a 12% revenue increase to $9.42 billion.Meanwhile, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) backed off 57.93 to 1,799 in very light volume. The closed end fund that tracks the popular alternative digital currency is trying to hold above its fast-rising 50-day moving average.While a pullback to the 50-day line and subsequent rebound can serve as a legitimate follow-on entry, keep in mind that the fund has already made a tremendous price run following a Nov. 22 breakout past 985.10 in a very deep cup with handle. The gain from that buy point reached as much as 257%.In addition, climax-run-style action also makes it more likely that Bitcoin Investment may need more time to shape another potential good base and supply a better entry point.One major differentiator between Alphabet and Apple for investors is the fact that for years, the former has been investing in self-driving technology that in the future could become standard in all vehicles. Some observers believe that its software development may eventually become a significant new revenue driver.For now, digital ads remain Alphabet's bread and butter. In the past six quarters, revenue has climbed 21%, 20%, 22%, 22%, 21% and 24% vs. year-ago levels. That fantastic growth has boosted earnings as well, up 42%, 27%, 7%, 28%, 27% and 32% vs. year-ago levels over the same time frame.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see earnings jumping 32% in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $10 a share, which would be a quarterly high. Alphabet has 694 million shares outstanding across all share classes and a float of 295 million. Revenue is seen rising 22% to $31.85 billion.Alphabet is slated to report Q4 results Feb. 1 after the close. The stock earns a top-notch 99 Composite Rating on IBD Stock Checkup, as well as an A for SMR Rating that tracks sales growth, profit margins, and return on equity.Apple continues to be on a solid growth track as well. The Street sees earnings in the December-ended fiscal first quarter rising 13% to $3.78 a share, then accelerating to a 38% gain to $2.90 in the March-ending second quarter, on revenue gains of 10% and 29%.Elsewhere, the Dow utility average flipped 0.3% lower amid another sell-off in U.S. Treasury bonds, sending the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond up to 2.64%, eclipsing the March 2017 high of 2.62%.WTI crude oil prices fell 0.9% to $63.36 a barrel but are still up 5% since Jan. 1.(Follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more analysis on growth stocks, charts and financial markets.)RELATED:Stocks Near A Buy ZoneThe Latest In Investor's CornerWhere Is The Stock Market Headed In 2018?

826,ADS,"If you're trying to build your earnings season watch list by looking for stocks setting up in a base ahead of earnings, here's one that fits the bill: IBD 50 member TAL Education (TAL). It's expected to report on Jan. 17 and is currently about 9% shy of a 36.26 buy point. The entry is based on a tenth-stage cup without handle.X Keep in mind that buying a stock just before it reports is risky, since an EPS or sales miss could send it sharply lower.

828,ADS,"Airbus (EADSY) Chief Executive Officer Tom Enders slammed Brexit and U.S. President Donald Trump's pro-America trade policies as presenting twin threats to its business, while singling out the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union as posing the bigger issue.X The developments amount to a ""double whammy"" of protectionist hazards, Enders said in London at the annual dinner of the ADS trade association, which represents more than 1,000 aerospace, defense, security and space companies.Brexit will weaken British industry and aerospace manufacturing in particular by increasing costs and curtailing competitiveness, the CEO said late Monday. While Airbus will seek to mitigate the impact on its business, ""whatever we can do, the net result I'm afraid will be negative,"" he said.The Toulouse, France-based company has 25 sites in the U.K., including its main wing design and production facilities, while the wider supply chain extends to 672 sites and more than 5,000 ""links or relations"" in commercial aviation alone, Enders said.Though Airbus should be protected from tariffs by an exemption granted to aerospace under World Trade Organization rules, it desperately requires clarity in areas such as future customs procedures and the movement of employees, according to the executive, who said employees make 80,000 business trips a year between the U.K. and other EU states.ADS President Colin Smith, a former head of government and regulatory affairs at Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc, used the event to call on Britain and the EU to negotiate a transition period for Brexit of not less than two years during which the status quo for businesses would prevail.Under Trump, the U.S. is ""no longer fighting for opening markets but to close the U.S. market to foreign companies and foreign competitors,"" with arch-rival Boeing (BA) a direct beneficiary, Enders said.Boeing is ""ruthlessly surfing on this 'America-first' wave,"" he said, citing the import duties imposed on the C Series jet built by Montreal-based Bombardier Inc. following complaints from the U.S. company that the model had benefited from illegal state aid.Labeling the levy to be imposed on U.S. carriers that buy the Canadian plane — in which Airbus has acquired a controlling stake — as ""predatory"" and ""bullying,"" Enders said that the move may bring short-term success but will ultimately be self-defeating, adding: ""You don't attack customers.""Still, ""the wreckage that President Trump will leave after four or eight years in the White House might be easier to repair than the U.K. exit from European Union,"" he said.The CEO added in a statement Tuesday that his remarks were meant to show that U.S. airlines would be best served through competition between ""healthy and balanced"" planemakers, rather than with Boeing as the dominant supplier.Airbus earlier revealed that it secured 1,109 jet orders last year, 52 percent more than in 2016, marking its sixth straight annual sales victory over Boeing. Commercial unit chief Fabrice Bregier said the trend means the European company should overhaul its competitor's lead in aircraft deliveries by 2020.The tally could reach 800 this year, Enders said, more than the 763 Boeing handed over in 2017, though the U.S. group is also accelerating output.Airbus shares edged down 0.3% to 27.45 on the stock market today. Boeing dipped 0.3% to 335.24 after hitting a record 347.73 intraday.

830,ADS,"Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) jumped Monday after grabbing an upgrade and a price target boost on its 2018 restructuring plan which looks ""more reasonable,"" one analyst said.X Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan upgraded Teva to an outperform rating from neutral and raised his price target to 23 from 20. Last week, Teva updated investors on its plan, which includes a new organizational structure and cutting its workforce by 14,000.The firm is also closing six plants and plans to announce another six closures by the end of 2018. It's also examining its portfolios and cut 27% of specialty programs. By year's end, Teva expects to achieve at least half the $3 billion spending cut it has planned.""Now that we have more details on the plan, including a 2018 outlook that we believe is achievable and we are seeing signs of early execution toward that plan, we are taking the additional step and upgrading Teva shares,"" Divan said in a note to clients.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Teva popped 3.6% to finish at 19.27.Guidance for $18.3 billion to $18.8 billion in sales for the year includes the potential impact of a generic version of Teva's multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone 40-milligram. Teva said on its earnings conference call that the first quarter should be the strongest.IBD'S TAKE: Teva is trading in line with its 50-day moving average. But what does that line mean and is it at risk? Head to the Investor's Corner for a closer look at using the 50-day moving average to pinpoint opportunity or risk.Mylan (MYL) already has approval of a Copaxone copycat. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) is delayed on its generic, but Momenta Pharmaceuticals (MNTA) and Novartis' (NVS) Sandoz unit should have a generic on the market this year, analysts say.Copaxone was ""the one bright spot"" in the fourth quarter, Divan said. Revenue of $821 million declined 19% but held up better than expected. He assumes a second generic will enter the market in the first half of 2018 and sees rapid sales erosion through 2019.A delay to Teva's migraine drug is a new negative, but was expected, Divan said. In that class of drugs, called CGRP inhibitors, Teva is rivaling Amgen (AMGN), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR).""We believe the migraine market is large enough for multiple blockbusters, even if Teva is third or fourth to the market,"" he said.U.S. generics are likely to continue facing challenges in 2018 amid pricing pressure, an acceleration in Food and Drug Administration approvals of competing generics and difficulty in acquiring share from drug originators, he said.Divan expects U.S. generic sales of $4 billion in 2018 declining to $3.8 billion in 2019 and then facing single-digit declines beyond that.""However, here as well we believe expectations entering 2018 are more reasonable than what they have been in the past, providing an opportunity for the company to meet or beat expectations as we move forward,"" he said.RELATED:Regeneron Could Benefit From 'Lackluster' Data Presented By These RivalsCan CRISPR And These 3 Small Biotechs Cure 10,000 DiseasesThese Biotechs Could Spring Back After Market Correction: Analyst

831,ADS,"Bitcoin lost nearly a tenth of its value Tuesday, crashing below the $10,000 level amid new regulatory measures in the U.S. and South Korea and sweeping advertising curbs by Facebook (FB). Other cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin- and blockchain-related stocks tumbled as well. Investors were selling a wide range of financial assets Tuesday, including stocks and commodities.X The cryptocurrency plunged 9% to $10,159.60 after hitting an intraday low of $9,810 according to CoinDesk. Bitcoin peaked above $20,000 on CME futures in mid-December. Ethereum also dropped by 8.7% to $1,079.83, while Bitcoin Cash was down 9.7% at $1,494.91.U.S. regulators are investigating one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges and a related company, Bloomberg reported. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission sent subpoenas to virtual-currency venue Bitfinex and the related traded coin Tether last week, Bloomberg said. The firms have the same CEO. There are said to be around $2.3 billion of the Tether tokens outstanding as of Tuesday. Tether claims all its coins are backed by U.S. dollars held in reserve, but has yet to provide conclusive evidence of its holdings.Meanwhile, South Korea's measures to combat money laundering came into effect. The country, a hot spot for cryptocurrency trading, had previously announced the barring of anonymous bank accounts on cryptocurrency exchanges amid money-laundering fears.Facebook is banning all ads touting cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and initial coin offerings. The Facebook blog post said the ban, as part of efforts to crack down on ""financial products and services frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices,"" was ""intentionally broad.""Bitcoin-related stocks were also hit, with Riot Blockchain (RIOT) down 6.2% on the stock market today, Long Blockchain (LBCC) 9%, Overstock.com (OSTK) 8.1%, Marathon Patent Group (MARA) 7.35%, and Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) 8.5%.Also Tuesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission had obtained a court order to freeze the assets of an initial coin offering. The complaint was filed in Dallas on Thursday and unsealed late Monday. In the filing the SEC said Dallas-based AriseBank had ""used social media, a celebrity endorsement, and other wide dissemination tactics to raise what it claims to be $600 million of its $1 billion goal in just two months.""""We allege that AriseBank and its principals sought to raise hundreds of millions from investors by misrepresenting the company as a first-of-its-kind decentralized bank offering its own cryptocurrency to be used for a broad range of customer products and services,"" Stephanie Avakian, co-director of the SEC's Enforcement Division, said in a press release. ""We sought emergency relief to prevent investors from being victimized by what we allege to be an outright scam.""U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee Tuesday the Treasury wants to make sure cryptocurrencies are not used by money launderers.""I want to make sure that these are not used by bad guys, that they don't turn into Swiss numbered bank accounts,"" Mnuchin said.He also said wants to be sure consumers understand the issues surrounding cryptocurrencies.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Before You Buy Bitcoin, Read ThisMillennial-Focused Robinhood Will Launch No-Fee Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency TradesDoes Your Broker Allow You To Play Bitcoin, Cryptocash Market?How To Invest In Stocks For Free: Robinhood, New Apps Aim For BeginnersBitcoin And Cryptocurrency News And Trends

Top stock Amazon.com (AMZN) rallied more than 1% in the stock market today, as it tried to recover a portion of last week's heavy loss.X The Nasdaq rose 1.1%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average held gains of 1.1% and 1.3%, respectively. Still, the major indexes still have a lot of work ahead of them to make up for last week's damage. Last week's action left the market in correction, so investors should mostly be in wait-and-see mode.Within the Dow industrials — of which only one was trading in negative territory — Cisco Systems (CSCO) paced the advancers with an over-3% rise. The networking giant is moving back above its 50-day line with strong relative strength.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) followed through on Friday's upside reversal with a 2.5% gain. Shares are trying to get back above their long-term 200-day moving average line.FANG stocks were mostly in rally mode early Monday, as they looked to snap back from last week's steep sell-offs. Leading the way were Amazon.com and video streamer Netflix (NFLX) with gains of 1.5% and 2.1%, respectively. The e-commerce giant neared its 50-day line Friday before rallying sharply off its lows.Shares of Netflix remain sharply extended from their previous 204.48 flat-base entry despite a loss of nearly 7% last week.Conversely, Facebook (FB) reversed from early gains to fall almost 1%. The stock is trying to recover back above its 50-day line, which it gave up last week in heavy volume.Meanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) tried to follow up Friday's earnings-related advance with a solid gain, but turned 0.5% lower. The stock has been volatile since a Jan. 8 breakout above a 218.77 cup-base entry within a difficult market environment. Still the stock is only about 8% off its 52-week high, while its relative strength line has been hitting new highs, signifying strong outperformance of the general market.Chinese e-commerce companies Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD) moved up about 2% apiece before trimming those gains. Alibaba remains below its 50-day line after a failed breakout above a 191.85 cup-base buy point, while JD was trying to recover its 50-day line amid its own failed breakout above a 47.50 cup-with-handle entry.Inside the IBD 50, Arista Networks (ANET) jumped about 3% to move within inches of a new 52-week high early Monday. The stock has done a tremendous job of holding up over the last week. Shares have once again found support at their 10-week line after a breakout above a 245.75 buy point.Elsewhere, Stamps.com (STMP) declined about 10% to fall through its 200-day line.

838,ADS,"The battle for tax reform is far from over. Rather, it is heating up all over again, and will be resolved only by the voters themselves this election year.XPresident Trump and Congressional Republicans are proposing new legislation this year to make all tax reform tax cuts permanent. That includes the tax rate cuts for the middle class and working people, which had to be phased out after 8 years in the tax reform bill to fit into the arbitrary budget window, because not a single Democrat would vote for the tax cuts to break a Senate filibuster.Democrats, by sharp contrast, are already campaigning to repeal the tax cuts, if elected to Congressional majorities, raising taxes. They proved during the Obama years they do not understand the fundamentals of economic growth, and are pledging to make America uncompetitive again by raising corporate tax rates.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveThat will snatch away the rising wages and new jobs that President Trump and Congressional Republicans restored in his first year. Gone too would be the $5 trillion in increased GDP over the next 10 years that tax reform will produce.Other countries around the world have been cutting their corporate tax rates for 20 years. That is why the average corporate tax rate in Asia is 20.1%; in Europe 18.9%. When Trump entered office, American companies and their workers suffered the highest corporate tax rates in the world at nearly 40%, counting state rates.That is why America suffered long term stagnation under President Obama, with growth rates of 2%, comparable to third world countries. After 50 years at those growth rates, America will be fundamentally transformed into just another third world country, like Peru.Democrat Party bosses like that, because they think they can then more easily dominate America as a one-party state, with majorities of American voters begging Democrats for more government handouts. Third world countries can't finance globally dominant militaries either.That is why to Democrats, tax reform's corporate tax rate cut that makes America competitive again is a ""corporate giveaway."" Democrats have bragged publicly that they are going to spend millions behind ads spreading the message, ""The Republican tax scheme gives huge breaks to corporations but raises taxes on middle class families.""But under tax reform as passed over the opposition of every single Democrat in Congress, the first $24,000 in income is tax free, for all taxpayers. Tax reform cut the income tax rate for middle class singles earning the next $9,525 to $38,700 by 20%, from 15% to 12%. It cut the rate for middle class singles earning $38,700 to  $82,500 by 12%, from 25% to 22%. For more prosperous workers earning $82,500-$157,500, the rate was cut by 14%, from 28% to 24%.For middle class families earning $19,050 to $77,400, tax reform cut the income tax rate by 20%, from 15% to 12%. For middle-class families earning $77,400 to $165,000, tax reform cut the rate by 12%, from 25% to 22%.Sad reality, but for Democrats to spend millions this year telling voters these tax cuts do not even exist means they will have to lie to voters. When their party controlled media echoes the Democrat Party line, democracy can be completely subverted, as it was in 2012. Mitt Romney proposed the largest middle class income tax cut in American history. But when the Democrats and their party controlled media got done with it, most voters in exit polls said they thought Romney was proposing middle class tax increases.It is equally fallacious for liberals to claim the tax reform will increase long term deficits and debt. The nonpartisan Tax Foundation estimates the $5 trillion in higher economic growth produced by tax reform would reduce the revenue loss to $448 billion over 10 years. Indeed, the tax reform will be producing net federal revenue increases by the 6th year, just as tax reform/tax cuts increased federal revenue under Reagan and Kennedy.Republicans this year should also propose to completely eliminate the unfair death tax. Taxes are paid on lifetime savings when the money is earned. It is double taxation to tax anything remaining at death again. Republicans should also propose to make ""expensing,"" meaning immediate deductions, for capital investment in productivity enhancing equipment, permanent as well, because that investment is the foundation for increased jobs and higher wages.You Might Also Like...Make Trump Tax Cuts Permanent — NowTax Cuts Work — Just Ask Small BusinessesThe Trump Economy, One Year In: A Success By All Measures Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

839,ADS,"Sprint (S)-parent Softbank made waves on Wednesday as the company said it's preparing to offer shares of its Japanese wireless and telecom business and reports surfaced that it's in talks to buy a stake in reinsurance giant Swiss Re.X Shares in Japan-based Softbank (SFTBY) rose 3.8% on Tokyo's stock exchange, as it also reported fiscal third-quarter earnings. Adjusted profit surged 11-fold to $8.4 billion, with revenue rising nearly 4% to $22 billion.Softbank could buy one-third of Swiss Re for around $10 billion, reported the Wall Street Journal. Acquiring a stake in Swiss Re would provide steady cash flow for Softbank's balance sheet. And an offering of shares in Japan could raise as much as $18 billion, Bloomberg reported, but some doubted the value of such a move.""An IPO would be credit-negative because it would result in a partial loss of dividends from SoftBank's principal subsidiary,"" said a Moody's Investor Service report.Softbank's portfolio may be confusing investors, says a Jefferies analyst in a report published Wednesday.""Softbank's reporting is becoming increasingly complex and unwieldy,"" said Atul Goyal, a Jefferies analyst based in Singapore, in a report. ""Besides profits in domestic (Japan) telecom, Sprint and Yahoo Japan, it booked 81 billion yen in (non-cash) losses from ARM, Brightstar goodwill impairment, and Fortress.""IBD'S TAKE: Finding the best stocks to buy can be tricky.

840,ADS,"Plunging shares of Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) weighed on generic drug stocks Thursday after sales and profits continued to drop and it offered weak 2018 guidance, all on top of word of a potential delay for its key migraine drug.X For the fourth quarter, Teva brought in adjusted profit of 93 cents per share on $5.46 billion in sales, declining 32.6% and 15.9%, respectively. Sales of multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone declined 19% to $821 million amid growing generic competition.For the year, Teva sees adjusted profit of $2.25-$2.50 per share on $18.3 billion to $18.8 billion in sales, lagging the consensus for $2.93 and $19.17 billion, respectively. Teva's outlook reflects the likelihood of increasing challenges.""Management noted that roughly half that decline reflects the impact of the loss of exclusivity on Copaxone 40 milligrams,"" Piper Jaffray analyst David Amsellem said in a note to clients. ""A significant chunk of the decline also, and not surprisingly, reflects continued pressure in the U.S. generics business.""By the closing bell on the stock market today, Teva plunged 10.6% to close at 18.64 though earlier it fell as much as 12.6%. Generic drug stocks collectively dipped 3%.Analysts say rival Mylan's (MYL) new Copaxone generic is priced at a 30% discount to Teva's branded drug. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) is delayed, but Momenta Pharmaceuticals (MNTA) and Novartis (NVS) unit Sandoz should have a 40-milligram generic on the market this year after a Pfizer (PFE) manufacturing facility passed its re-inspection.Generic drug sales fell 16% year over year to $3.11 billion. In 2017, Teva recorded $17.1 billion in goodwill impairments related to its U.S. generics business. Pricing pressure, government regulation, accelerated generic approvals in the U.S. and delays in launches continue to be challenges.While sales were down, Teva profits and revenue both topped the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for adjusted profit of 81 cents a share on $5.3 billion in sales. Copaxone sales also beat the consensus view for $611 million, Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler said in a note to clients. Still, she expects another generic entrant in mid-2018.IBD'S TAKE: Teva's Relative Strength Rating has been on the rise this month. It now has an RS Rating of 86 out of a best-possible 99. See what goes into that rating by visiting IBD Data Stories.Further, Teva said the manufacturer of the active pharmaceutical ingredient used in its migraine drug, fremanezumab, received a warning letter from the Food and Drug Administration regarding the fill/finish part of its facility. This means fremanezumab could be delayed.Fremanezumab is currently set to go before the FDA in June. The drug belongs to a class known as anti-CGRPs, which aim to prevent migraines. Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR), Amgen (AMGN) and Eli Lilly (LLY) are all working on drugs in this class.""This is another source of anxiety surrounding a business that simply cannot afford to have additional missteps, particularly in the context of a highly competitive anti-CGRP/migraine space,"" Amsellem said.RELATED:Sanofi, Regeneron Dip As Eczema Drug Dupixent Lags In EuropeCan CRISPR And These 3 Small Biotechs Cure 10,000 Diseases?These Biotechs Could Spring Back After Market Correction: Analyst

Further, Corcept has a next-generation version that could hit the market in 2020 or 2021.IBD'S TAKE: Camille Callais was diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy in 2014. Then, the doctor told her parents, ""There's nothing you can do."" Today, it's a different story for Camille and other children diagnosed with this rare disease. Head to the Industry Snapshot for details.On timing, Corcept has 45 days to respond to Teva's application for a generic Korlym. This buys Corcept 30 months until the first generic could be approved and marketed. This should give the biotech more time to expand Corcept's prescriptions and possibly tack on price increases.Recently, Corcept guided to 2018 sales of $275 million to $300 million, north of Duncan's model for $264 million. This ""points to ongoing organic growth,"" Duncan said. He also argued, ""the business model for Korlym may be difficult to replicate by a larger player such as Teva.""Late Friday, Prothena announced the departure of Chief Medical Officer Sarah Noonberg, who joined Prothena in May 2017. She will provide transitional support to Prothena until March 15. Martin Koller, former CMO, will step in on a consulting basis until someone new is appointed.Investor concern is overdone, Instinet analyst Christopher Marai said in a note. Prothena is still running trials called Pronto and Vital to test a drug called NEOD001 in AL amyloidosis, a disorder in which the bone marrow produces abnormal antibodies that can't be broken down.""We do not anticipate regulatory filings for NEOD001 to be impacted by Sarah's departure,"" he said. ""We recommend adding to positions of Prothena on weakness caused by assumptions around the CMO's departure, noting Pronto and Vital still remain blinded.""RELATED:Bristol-Myers Squibb Dives Despite Strong Earnings, Opdivo DataCan CRISPR And These 3 Small Biotechs Cure 10,000 Diseases?AstraZeneca's Lynparza Now 'King' Of Its Class — Triumphing Over Tesaro

847,ADS,"LAS VEGAS – Amazon (AMZN) wants users of its Alexa voice interface technology to do more than ask simple questions about the weather and traffic or give basic commands to play music and control the lights. It wants users to have conversations with Alexa.X That's the message David Isbitski, Amazon's chief evangelist for Alexa and Echo, delivered to a standing-room-only session Wednesday at CES 2018, the giant consumer technology trade show that started Tuesday and runs through Friday.The goal is for people to have conversations with Amazon Echo smart speakers and other devices like they're on ""Star Trek,"" chatting with the computer, Isbitski said. It's a concept he called ""ambient computing.""""We're living in that future now where we can talk to technology like human beings,"" he said at a forum that kicked off two days of Amazon Alexa educational sessions for consumer tech firms at CES.Amazon shares inched up 0.1% Wednesday to end the regular trading session at 1,254.33, an all-time closing high.Scores of companies at CES announced that they are integrating Alexa voice controls in products ranging from lighting, thermostats and door locks to refrigerators and cars.Rival Google, a unit of Alphabet (GOOGL), also is at the show, pushing hard to get its Google Assistant voice technology integrated into as many devices as possible. Google wrapped the Las Vegas Monorail trains with its ""Hey, Google"" voice prompt message and bought video advertisements on the Las Vegas Strip at the Fashion Show Mall.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon broke back into buy territory last week.

It remains 12th in IBD's Retail-Internet Group behind top-ranked Alibaba (BABA).Google set up a whimsical building outside the Las Vegas Convention Center and operated giant gumball machines that dispensed prizes for CES attendees.But Amazon was first to market with a smart speaker with voice technology and holds a commanding lead. More than 25,000 skills have been created for Alexa to date. Those skills allow users to control devices and to get access to online information on specific topics.""At Amazon, we really feel that this represents the next major disruption in computing,"" Isbitski said. ""This is going to be the most natural way to interact with technology.""The next step for voice-activated personal assistants like Alexa is for the technology to become more infused with artificial intelligence and to understand context and remember previous conversations and interactions, he said. In other words, they need to get smarter and learn the behavior and preferences of users.

Citi expects these newer areas to drive the ""next leg of growth.""""Big data is one of our key competencies,"" Chief Executive Min Lu said during the company's quarterly earnings call on Nov. 7. ""Being a leader in the market, we're positioned to build and unify our comprehensive database of auto consumers and vehicles in China and leverage this vast amount of data to offer vehicle planning and design, consumer acquisition and sales leads conversion, highly targeted marketing solutions and detailed competitive analysis and sales projections.""Over the last three quarters, earnings growth has accelerated from 15% to 39% to 58%, and that upward trend is projected to continue in the fourth quarter.Analysts expect Autohome's next quarterly earnings to hit 75 cents a share, which would be a 60% rise year over year according to Zacks Research.After consolidating for over four months, Autohome shares surged nearly 11% in heavy volume on Jan. 2, sailing beyond a 67.79 buy point. The stock is continuing to extend its gains and is now trading roughly 7% above the entry. Looking at a weekly chart, the Relative Strength line is hitting new high ground, which confirms the move.The recent pop not only coincided with Citi's initiation of coverage, but it also came as positive economic data out of China lifted the nation's internet stocks as a group.Out on Jan. 2, the December reading for the Caixin/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index for manufacturing reached 51.5.

UBS maintained its sell rating in the wake of Autohome's quarterly report in early November, saying there's a ""lack of visibility in (the) 2018 growth outlook.""In particular, analyst Ming Xu noted concerns about a potential slowdown in advertising revenue growth and is cautious about ""revenue contribution from the auto finance platform due to limited value add.""On the other end of the spectrum, CLSA analyst Man Ho Lam said in a Nov. 14 research report that the auto finance platform has the ""potential to begin contributing meaningfully"" to revenue this year, according to StreetInsider.

In that span, Asher Anolic will temporarily take the helm from marquee manager Jason Weiner, who will spend that period away from the fund on a leave of absence, traveling with his family and pursuing educational opportunities.X Anolic will be the acting manager not only of the $1.7 billion Growth Discovery but also of its advisor-sold twin, $3.1 billion Advisor Equity Growth (FAEGX).For Anolic, the challenge is weighty. Weiner, who has steered the funds since February 2007 and early November of 2006 respectively, has led them to rarefied success.The funds outperformed the broad market in the form of the S&P 500 in the latest calendar year, 2017, as well as the three and five years ended Dec. 31. If the funds keep up that pace and add outperformance over the past 10 years, they will earn inclusion as IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards winners. Only 4% of U.S. diversified stock mutual funds with at least $100 million in assets pulled off that feat by the end of 2016.Weiner — with Anolic as co-manager since July 1 — achieved that multiperiod outperformance with portfolios featuring leading stocks like Five Below (FIVE), Red Hat (RHT) and Alibaba Group (BABA), as well as household names like Facebook (FB)  and Amazon.com (AMZN), two of the FANG stocks.Shortly before 48-year-old Weiner began his sabbatical, he and 39-year-old Anolic talked with IBD from their Boston offices about their managerial juggling act and how their investment styles overlap and how they differ.IBD: Jason, has your management style changed since Asher joined you as co-manager?Weiner: Absolutely, yes. Any time you take on a partner, you talk about what you think, what your partner thinks. Ash came with experience in health care and staples, and with a much sharper quantitative investment focus. No two people have the same skill set. So one plus one equals more than two.IBD: Asher, have you changed?Anolic: With my background in staples and health care and financials, I never had a chance to encounter some of the big open-ended growth stories that Jason has done an excellent job figuring out. Those companies can have huge addressable markets, which become multiples of what people think they are today.In the past, I would have shied away from those because I was afraid of getting caught in something that I wasn't able to visualize where it could go. Jason's been great helping me out there.IBD: Since before the 2016 elections, the fund has swung toward cyclical stocks, then growth stocks, then back to cyclicals. How has that worked for the fund?Weiner: In 2016 growth didn't perform well and we didn't get paid for owning them. We got it all back in 2017 for the first three-quarters of the year. In the last quarter those leadership names took a breather. But I think it's healthy because we don't want a bubble.We stuck with growth. Now our job is to look forward into 2018 and figure out how to extend the process. No matter what the short-term gyrations are, how do we stick with names that are growing earnings and adding value?IBD: What's been the biggest change in the market during your career, Jason?Weiner: When I started at Fidelity in 1991, I was a junior analyst picking small-cap names. There was an inherent advantage because small companies were where you found little trees that grew into big trees.Today, it's completely the opposite. The only companies growing fast are the biggest companies in the world, companies with market caps of $500 billion. That's really driven by internet economics. This is very different, very unique.IBD: And you still look for the best growth opportunities, with an overlay of valuation sensitivity?Weiner: That hasn't changed. We look for undervalued growth stories and stocks with the potential for price-to-earnings (P/E) expansion, while avoiding names that have unreasonably high valuations or deteriorating business fundamentals.IBD: Asher, what changes will you make while Jason is out?Anolic: Aside from the fact that I don't love the decor (which drew laughter from both Anolic and Weiner), I expect changes in less than a quarter of the holdings. Jason has constructed the portfolio with a two-year horizon. We've tested lots of what-if scenarios. Nothing should surprise us. If something does crop up out of left field, I will adjust. But the fundamental approach will not change.IBD: Does Facebook still meet your valuation check box?Weiner: It's valuation is a lot higher than a year ago. It occurred because they grew fast. Earnings went up. They're touching 1 billion people a day with News Feed, their main product. You can sell a lot of advertising when you touch over 1 billion people a day.I still think they will improve their ad targeting. So fundamentals are intact. Can I find better value elsewhere (in another stock)? That search goes on every day. After the big move in these (internet) names in the last year, that conversation is a little more intense.IBD: With Amazon, you're comfortable that their spending will pay off within a reasonable period?Weiner: If you say retail as we knew it is dead and the retail of tomorrow is being invented as we speak, which companies are at the forefront? It is Alibaba and Amazon.We like to take a company's profit-and-loss statement and break down the business units. For Amazon, it's domestic retail and international retail and Amazon Web Services. How is each performing? What are their opportunities? With the investments they make, what will future earnings be like?IBD: Asher, what would you add?Anolic: AWS is cost intensive, more than the rest of Amazon. But it has taken a ton of market share, and has good margins and good cash flow. It's at the forefront of a major technological shift.IBD: Any more thoughts about Alibaba?Weiner: I look at Amazon and Alibaba as a pair. You want to distill the thoughts of Alibaba's Jack Ma (founder and executive chairman) and Amazon's Jeffrey Bezos (founder, chairman and CEO)? Looking at them together is helpful to understanding what those visionaries are doing. Just one part of that is inventing a new world of retail.IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news and analysis of Chinese stocks, visit IBD's special section about Chinese stocks to buy and watch.IBD: Does Five Below defy the problems of many brick-and-mortar retailers by discounting and by focusing on a teen audience?Weiner: It's too small to worry about, but I will tell you this: It's like Dollar Tree (DLTR) plus a treasure-hunt thing. Mom can bring her kids, who go to the $5 basketballs while mom goes to the $5 makeup aisle. I remember the CEO saying once, ""This is the only store where you can bring your kids and not have any fears.""IBD: Red Hat is the top provider of open-source Linux software for corporate data centers. Is that like being the top buggy-whip maker?Anolic: With the move to the cloud, people are worried about Red Hat's growth prospects. If you have a Linux operating system for several servers, but then you move a lot of that data to AWS or Google Cloud or Microsoft (Azure), you don't need all of those servers or that operating system.But Red Hat's core Linux business is still fantastic. Much in the cloud runs on Linux. And Red Hat is reinventing its business. They have a new product that can write programs on top of the Red Hat system and port them to different clouds. It gives CIOs the flexibility of not getting locked in to one cloud vendor. This gives some visibility to how Red Hat looks in a cloud environment. We're going to keep monitoring it. It's a fascinating solution.IBD: What business hasn't been totally disrupted, but could be eventually?Weiner: Digital payments. Payments in general have entrenched players like Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) and card-issuing banks like Citi (C) and JPMorgan (JPM) and merchant acquirers like First Data (FDC) and Global Payments (GPN). That system has been built over decades.But PayPal has given us a taste of disruption. We've all used PayPal at checkout. Can they take that beachhead and expand into the payment space? They've already got Venmo in people-to-people payments. And they own Braintree, which (provides mobile and web payments acceptance and processing for) merchants. (The payments space) feels ripe for disruption.IBD: Why do you like Copart (CPRT)?Weiner: It's a duopoly (with KAR Auction Services (KAR)), a great business. Hurricane Irma rolls through (the Caribbean and) Florida, Harvey hits Houston, and 100,000 cars get wrecked. They get disposed of through auto auctions. Copart is family run, has super profitability and super acquisitions. When cars get totaled, sometimes the scrap value is higher than a resale value.IBD: Asher, you're continuing to run $784 million Select Pharmaceuticals (FPHAX). What's the biggest change in joining Jason at the helm of Growth Discovery?Anolic: Jason has been helpful in teaching and generous with his time. So I'm totally up to speed on what is needed. And we worked together before I was named co-manager, so I was familiar with how he runs money.The biggest change is moving from one sector to the whole market. Six months of partnering doesn't teach you everything that someone running for 20-plus years has learned. But the skill set I've built allows me to understand day-to-day market moves and how to learn as I go.IBD: Jason, was Asher's apprenticeship long enough?Weiner: Asher is an experienced investor. And the way the fund (Growth Discovery) is built, 70% of its assets are in the top 40 names, so Asher only has to learn about 40 names to understand nearly three-quarters of the portfolio. Also, Asher already knew some names from his work on other mutual funds. And we have a huge amount of research support.IBD: Jason, will you be able to hit the ground running when you return in May or so?Weiner: I think I'll be raring to go. I'll have had a nice break, but it will be nice to get back to business.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:2018 Stock Market Forecast: Smaller Price Gains, With A Foreign TiltHot Fidelity Fund Owns Stocks Like Tencent That Jumped Friday

865,ADS,"January's stock market performance reinforced fund manager expectations that economic growth abroad will be stronger than in the U.S.X ""Many investors believe that Europe and Latin America and places like Japan have the potential for even stronger earnings growth than the U.S. in coming quarters,"" said Tom Galvin, lead manager of $4.3 billion Columbia Select Large Cap Growth (ELGAX). ""That has led to some allocation shifts to non-U. S. stock names.""U.S.-focused Columbia Select Large Cap Growth is capitalizing on the trend in another way. ""Our fund contains many U.S. multinationals, which in aggregate obtain nearly half of their revenues from outside the U.S., so we benefit from the synchronized global recovery that way,"" Galvin said.And January's stock market showing was itself clear cut and upbeat — a fast start for the new year. The S&P 500 rocketed up 5.73%, pulling U.S. diversified stock mutual funds up 4.37% on average. That was the S&P 500's 15th straight monthly gain and its best monthly gain since March 2016's 6.78% jump. For U.S. diversifieds, it was the fifth monthly gain in a row and their best since November 2016's 5.19% climb.The broad market got a lift last month from such Dow Jones industrial stocks as Boeing (BA), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Travelers Companies (TRV) and Walmart (WMT).World equity mutual funds did even better than U.S. diversified stock funds, rising 5.66%.""The gains are evidence that economies in the U.S. and around the world are doing well,"" said Stephen DuFour, manager of $1.7 billion Fidelity Focused Stock Fund (FTQGX), which topped 86% of its peers tracked by Morningstar Direct last month. ""When I talk with people producing tractors, combines, I hear about growth in areas where it hasn't been seen in years. In the U.S., unemployment is low, wages are rising and corporate earnings were very strong the last couple of weeks. And earnings projections are rising, getting a boost from lower tax rates.""The solid gains in January came amid month-end market softness. The market was rattled by rising bond yields, the prospect of new pricing pressure on health care providers and rising oil production, Galvin said. Rising bond yields fueled fears of a rotation from dividend paying stocks into fixed income.Countering with some upward pressure were strong corporate profit reports and job gains, as well as the Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates unchanged.By Thursday, though, there was enough downward pressure for IBD to read the market's direction as uptrend under pressure. Three out of four stocks follow the market's direction, according to IBD research, so stock mutual funds are likely to have more difficulty generating gains.With a 7.99% gain, large-cap growth funds paced all U.S. diversified stock fund categories in January. Global science/technology funds topped all sector categories by advancing 8.27%.Latin American funds led world equity fund groups with a 9.9% burst.U.S. taxable bonds eked out a 0.05% gain amid expectations of three Fed interest rate increases this year.Going forward, the technology, health care and consumer sectors look like the most fertile grounds for investment opportunities to Galvin, whose fund outperformed 72% of its peer group in the 12 months ended Jan. 31.The consumer sector is still showing strength after a strong holiday shopping season, he says. In health care, recently announced mergers have fueled anticipation of more consolidation, he says. ""Coupled with the benefits of offshore cash coming home due to tax reform, that's added to investor interest,"" he said.He notes a wave of tech companies are due to report earnings in February. ""I look at tech stocks as industrials on steroids,"" he said, ""with better corporate profits and benefits from lower corporate tax rates. We should see stronger capital spending, which will likely lead to greater spending in IT (information technology). Those factors should sustain strong gains by tech in 2018.""Amazon.com (AMZN), his largest holding, after the close Thursday reported Q4 earnings that smashed expectations amid strong sales growth.Looking beyond the near term, Galvin said, ""Despite its spending, Amazon has a long runway. It continues to grow its presence in a variety of sectors. This week's announcement about a health care partnership with Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) (to form a new health care company) is another reminder that Amazon has a presence not just in pure retail.""Galvin likes Alibaba Group (BABA) because it benefits from the fast growth of online commerce in China. ""It's the largest e-commerce retailer in China,"" he said. ""And China continues to show strong economic growth. And the accelerating preference for online spending there should power strong double-digit earnings growth in coming quarters.""Alibaba on Thursday reported that fiscal Q3 earnings rose 25% on a 66% sales increase, but earnings were below expectations.IBD'S TAKE: See how Alibaba's strengths — like four consecutive years of annual earnings per share growth and being ranked No. 1 in IBD's Retail-Internet industry group — stack up against its peers at the stock's easy-to-read IBD Stock Checkup page.And he likes the prospects for Priceline (PCLN). ""It's been a laggard, but it's a leader in online travel. Consumer spending will strengthen because of growth in wages, lower taxes and (younger generations looking for novel travel experiences). It should be a midteens earnings grower, although there are some questions about margin pressure in the near term.""Tech names that Fidelity's DuFour likes include tax- and accounting-software provider Intuit (INTU) and Microsoft (MSFT).Like Adobe, Intuit is shifting to a subscription model for cloud-based software from sold-in-stores software packages. ""They've got stronger growth because the (new model) lets them produce their programs for different countries by adding new language versions,"" DuFour said.Microsoft's Azure, a cloud computing competitor for Amazon Web Services, ""let's Microsoft cope with a changing world."" Growth in online gaming is one aspect of that, he added.And Walmart (WMT) is a newcomer to his top 10. ""Walmart has the size and capability to actually take on Amazon,"" he said. Walmart is learning how to compete online with Amazon from its acquisition of Jet.com, a low-cost online sellers of a wide range of goods.One example of how Walmart can leverage its existing assets is by having store employees deliver goods to customers on their way home from work, DuFour said.Charles Shriver, lead manager of T. Rowe Price's $2.4 billion Personal Strategy Balanced (TRPBX) and $344 million Global Allocation (RPGAX) funds, says his funds have shifted to overweight in foreign stocks. Many Japanese and eurozone stocks offer better valuations than many U.S. stocks, he says. Those markets have accommodative monetary policies at a time when the U.S. Federal Reserve is raising rates. And those stocks provide exposure to markets growing faster than in the U.S.Among Global Allocation's holdings, Japan's Sumitomo is a diversified conglomerate that trades goods and services. Shares were up 33% in the 12 months ended Jan. 31. ADRs for car and truck maker Toyota Motor (TM) were up 19% in those 12 months.ADRs of Bayer (BAYRY), a German-based maker of drugs, chemicals and agricultural treatments, are up 18% in the past 12 months. Earnings per share were flat in Q3 after two quarters of decline.ADRs of drugmaker Novartis (NVS), whose Swiss headquarters is not in the eurozone, were up 22% in the past 12 months. EPS grew 0%, 5% and 8% the past three quarters.RELATED:2018 Stock Market Forecast: Smaller Gains, With A Foreign Tilt

869,ADS,"At its most basic level, a flagship IBD sell rule to take a 20% to 25% gain in a great stock is straightforward.XDecades of IBD research show that a stock tends to correct sharply in price once the gain from a base breakout reaches that threshold. That said, implementing the rule isn't always a slam dunk, especially when it comes to stocks showing signs they could be big leaders.The bottom line: While it's a good idea to take a 20%-25% gain if you have it, take other factors into consideration. Is the market in the early stages of a new bull run, or the later stages? Are distribution days, or signs of institutional selling in the Nasdaq and S&P 500, too prominent to ignore? And how much conviction do you have in the stock?In 2017, hordes of highly rated stocks broke out, made gains of that magnitude, pulled back in very light fashion, then kept going higher.Autohome's (ATHM) gain from a 67.79 entry recently hit 28%. A 20% gain came within three weeks after the Jan. 2 breakout, meaning the Chinese automobile online ad and marketing firm has potential to be an even bigger market leader. It's been an easy hold so far for those who bought the Leaderboard stock at the latest entry.So, what's a good game plan from here? Well, one option is to take the gain and move on. Another strategy? Hold longer and wait for meaningful signs of heavy selling in the stock.Short-term traders waiting for a convincing break by Autohome of the 10-day moving average got one Tuesday when shares fell 2.5% to 82.46. Selling right at the close would have produced a 21.6% profit. However, volume was just average and the stock closed near its session high. The problem with waiting for a test of the 10-week moving average is that the support level corresponds close to Autohome's latest buy area. Letting a stock erase a double-digit gain from a buy point isn't sound strategy.Third option? Sell half the position for a profit, and give the other half more room to work.After an Aug. 28, 2017, breakout over a 110.01 buy point, former Leaderboard name Thor Industries (THO) quickly hit the 20% to 25% profit level. Some may have decided to take profits when the RV maker fell 4.7% in higher volume in the week ended Nov. 10, but it held above the 10-week moving average.The Nasdaq composite showed six distribution days, an elevated count, but many of them showed relatively mild percentage declines. Those who sat tight, waiting for a legitimate test of the 10-week line, were rewarded when Thor found support, then made new highs. By Nov. 29, Thor hit a high of 156.86, raising its gain to 42%. A defense-type sell signal flashed when shares slumped 10% in the week ended Jan. 26.RELATED:How To Build Long-Term Profits In Your Portfolio: Take Most Gains At This LevelCan Some Big Stock Market Winners Keep Rising After Forming Multiple Bases?How Options Can Help You Win Big During Earnings SeasonStocks Near A Buy Zone

870,ADS,"AstraZeneca's (AZN) Lynparza is now ""king"" of its realm in cancer treatments — beating out rival Tesaro (TSRO) — an analyst said Friday after the U.K.-based drugmaker reported sales of the cancer drug that crushed expectations.X During the fourth quarter, AstraZeneca reported $54 million in U.S. sales of Lynparza, smashing the consensus view for $39 million, RBC analyst Kennen MacKay said in a note to clients. That beat Tesaro's guidance for $40 million to $50 million in sales of rival Zejula.Lynparza, Zejula and Clovis Oncology's (CLVS) Rubraca all belong to a class of medicine called PARP inhibitors which are being used to treat ovarian cancer but have some promise also in breast, prostate and other cancers.This is the second straight quarter of strong U.S. Lynparza sales following the August approval as a second maintenance therapy in a broad group of ovarian cancer patients, MacKay said. U.S. Lynparza sales have now more than doubled since that approval.""We view this strong uptake as a negative competitive threat for Tesaro, and potentially indicative that Lynparza has become the preferred agent in the second-line maintenance setting,"" he said.AstraZeneca reported $100 million in global Lynparza sales for the quarter. That puts it on a run rate for $400 million, MacKay said. Growth is also expected from expansion as a second-line ovarian cancer maintenance therapy in Europe and as treatment for some breast cancer patients in the U.S.""We view this as a favorable sign for the size of the class, but anticipate weakness in Tesaro shares on this disclosure given competitive pressure and recent Tesaro guidance implying slowing Zejula sales growth into the fourth quarter,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: Last week, AstraZeneca got an upgrade to its Relative Strength Rating, rising as high as 75 out of a best-possible 99. Today, its RS Rating is 65. See what goes into that rating by visiting IBD Data Stories.On the stock market today, AstraZeneca rose 2.1% to 35.88. Tesaro sank 5.5% to 59.94. Clovis slid 4.1% to 56.82.For the fourth quarter, AstraZeneca reported core earnings of $1.30 per share, beating the consensus for 84 cents per share, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a note to clients. Core earnings grew 7%.Total revenue of $5.78 billion grew 3% and topped the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $5.59 billion. Fernandez lists another consensus figure which put sales at $5.48 billion.

871,ADS,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) beat fourth-quarter sales expectations by more than 9% and has selected a pair of cystic fibrosis treatments to send into late-stage testing, the company said late Wednesday.X Vertex reported adjusted income of 61 cents per share on $651.6 million in sales, rising a respective 74% and 42% vs. the year-earlier period. Both metrics beat the consensus for adjusted profit of 58 cents a share on $596 million in sales.Of its total sales, Vertex brought in $621 million in revenue from cystic fibrosis treatments, growing 37% year over year. Its biggest drug, Orkambi, increased 32% to $365 million and Kalydeco, also known as ivacaftor, tacked on 44% growth to $256 million.Chief Executive Jeffrey Leiden called 2017 ""an outstanding year for Vertex,"" in a written statement.""As we look at 2018 and beyond, Vertex's scientific expertise and financial strength position us to advance key pipeline programs in CF, including our triple combination regimens and bring forth potential new medicines in multiple other serious diseases.""In after-hours trading on the stock market today, Vertex popped 3.2% after closing up 0.2%, to 166.87, during the regular session.The triple-pill treatments are expected to treat up to 90% of cystic fibrosis patients, said Jeffrey Chodakewitz, Vertex's executive vice president and chief medical officer. Vertex plans to send combos using the drugs known as VX-659 and VX-445 into late-stage testing this year.""We look forward to concluding our discussions with regulators and initiating Phase 3 development in the first half of the year, with the goal of bringing a triple regimen to patients as quickly as possible,"" Chodakewitz said in a written statement.Excitement has been building surrounding the potential triple-pill, which targets the underlying genetic cause of the disease. In total, Vertex had four potential combinations it was considering.Vertex has now narrowed that down to two potential combinations. A combination of VX-659, tezacaftor and ivacaftor will begin two Phase 3 trials in the first half of 2018. The two studies will investigate the regimen's effect in two patient groups with different genetic mutations.IBD'S TAKE: Vertex wasn't always a cystic fibrosis-focused company. In its earliest days, it was focused on hepatitis C until Gilead Sciences launched a massively successful drug called Sovaldi in 2011. How did Vertex escape that crisis? Head to The New America for more.Pending additional data in the first half of the year, Vertex also plans to send a combination of VX-445 with tezacaftor and a drug called VX-561 into Phase 3 testing as a once-daily treatment in two groups of patients with different genetic mutations.Vertex selected the treatments based on ongoing studies which show absolute improvements in patients' ability to forcefully expel air for one second. Those treated with VX-659 and VX-445 regimens showed improvements of 13.3 and 13.8 percentage points, respectively, through four weeks of treatment in some cystic fibrosis patients.The triple combinations were generally well tolerated across both studies, Vertex said, with the majority of adverse events mild or moderate in severity. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were low.Vertex isn't the only firm seeking to make a triple-regimen to treat cystic fibrosis. AbbVie (ABBV) and Galapagos (GLPG) have also teamed up to make a triple-pill. But analysts have said the duo is several years behind. Most see Vertex's triple getting approval in the 2019-20 time frame.In February, Vertex expects to get approval in the U.S. for a regimen of tezacaftor and ivacaftor as a treatment for cystic fibrosis patients ages 12 and older with a specific genetic mutation. European regulators will make their determination in the second half of 2018.Vertex said it will issue 2018 guidance for cystic fibrosis drug sales after the anticipated U.S. approval for the tezacaftor and ivacaftor regimen on Feb. 28. Analysts expect Vertex to offer an outlook of $2.89 a share in adjusted earnings on $2.73 billion in sales.Vertex is also planning to move forward with Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP) using gene therapy to treat blood diseases known as beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease.

Or they can order fresh food and have it prepared by Hema chefs. Further, they can pay for any of it using the Alibaba online payment platform Alipay.The idea is to draw customers deeper into Alibaba's consumer-facing ecosystem. It's a strategy comparable to what e-commerce leader Amazon (AMZN) is doing with its $113.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods Markets.Alibaba shares climbed 2.7% to close at 190.70 on the stock market today.Amazon also believes the future of retail is a mix of mostly online retail and some offline brick-and-mortar retailing, wrote venture capitalist Gene Munster, in his list of predictions this week.

881,ADS,"China e-commerce leader Alibaba (BABA) received several price target increases Friday following a mixed quarterly earnings report that raised concern about profits as the company missed bottom-line estimates.X Financial research firm S3 Partners issued a report on Alibaba that focused on the amount of its shares that are sold short. S3 said short interest in Alibaba shares, by dollar volume, is the highest of any stock worldwide. Following Alibaba in the short category was China-based Ping An Insurance and electric-car maker Tesla (TSLA) — a favorite target of short sellers.On Thursday, Alibaba reported its fastest revenue growth in at least 15 quarters for its fiscal third quarter, but earnings fell short of estimates. Revenue soared 56% to $12.8 billion.Following that report, Baird analyst Colin Sebastian raised his price target on Alibaba to 220 from 210 and maintained a rating of outperform, which he based on the quarterly results. The report came after Alibaba management raised its revenue estimates for fiscal 2018.Needham analyst Kerry Rice raised his price target on Alibaba to 220 from 215 and maintained a buy rating, saying that Alibaba fundamentals remain intact.Wells Fargo analyst Ken Sena was less enthusiastic, as he lowered his price target to 220 from 225 based on concerns about profitability, but maintained a rating of outperform.Alibaba's stock price reacted negatively to the earnings report, falling as much as 5.9%. Shares closed down 2.55% to 187.31 on the stock market today, dropping below a 191.85 buy point.

If the stock falls, they can buy the shares back, return them to the owner and pocket the difference. But if shares rise, the short seller can face big losses.S3 said short sellers have continued to bet against Alibaba, based partly on an ""overheated"" stock price, a bet against the China economy. They are also betting that rivals such as Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) and Baidu (BIDU) will challenge its dominance, while Amazon (AMZN) will challenge globally.Amazon soared to a record high Friday as it received a bundle of price target increases from analysts following a strong fourth-quarter earnings report. While Alibaba dominates the e-commerce market in China as Amazon does in the U.S., the two are gradually setting up for a global battle.Alibaba's short exposure has tripled in just over two years, according to S3. As of Thursday, Alibaba short interest was $25.9 billion, followed by Ping An Insurance at $16.3 billion and Tesla at $10.7 billion. In November Tesla short interest was $8.26 billion.The short position is a subject with which Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk is familiar.

It's holding just above a 124.04 buy point.FANG name Netflix (NFLX) continued to prove its mettle with a bounce off the 10-day moving average. Shares rose 1.6% to 269.25.

884,ADS,"The oil-price rally worked both ways for Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) as improved exploration and production lifted profit to a three-year high while refining and trading fell short of expectations as margins shrank.X Crude's surge raised adjusted profit at Europe's largest energy company to $4.3 billion last quarter, the highest since 2014. While the bottom line was better than expected -- and Shell is making as much money with oil at $60 a barrel as when it was $100 -- cash flow was the weakest since 2016.""Unfortunately, resilient earnings do not appear to have translated into cash generation,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Biraj Borkhataria said in a note. ""This result leaves gearing falling by less than we expected"" and could temper hopes of a share buyback program in the very near term, he said.Oil majors including Shell have cleaned up their balance sheets to survive the worst industry downturn in a generation, eliminating expensive projects and laying off staff to cut capital expenditure. After those efforts and a recovery in oil prices, some analysts predict a bright 2017. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s Michele Della Vigna said it could be Big Oil's best year in decades, so long as companies maintain discipline.Higher earnings and cash flow in 2017 are helping Chief Executive Officer Ben Van Beurden cut debt, which rose to a record of almost $78 billion following the acquisition of BG Group Plc. He can claim the company is headed in the right direction, but is still sitting on top of a massive $65 billion debt mountain, compared with just $24 billion at the end of 2014.""We have been able to pay down our debt quite a bit"" after a very good year, Van Beurden said in a Bloomberg Television interview. ""I'm very, very confident that we can indeed meet the commitments, the promises that we made, for the end of the decade, which is to have $25 to $30 billion free cash flow.""Exploration and production earnings of $1.65 billion beat analyst estimates provided by Shell. Refining and marketing profit of $1.4 billion was down both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year, falling short of expectations.Lower margins at the end of December and a smaller contribution from trading were partly responsible for the refining unit's declining earnings, Van Beurden told reporters in London. U.S. Gulf Coast margins dropped to an average $8.59 a barrel in the fourth quarter, compared with $13.04 in the preceding three months, according to Shell's documents. Rotterdam and Singapore showed similar proportional declines.Van Beurden has said he wants to make Shell the best-performing oil major, surpassing Exxon Mobil (XOM). The Dutch company is the closest it's ever been to attaining the long-coveted prize of overtaking its American rival, at least based on market value.Shell's 2017 profit was $16.18 billion, more than double the previous year. Exxon Mobil is expected to report annual earnings of $15.7 billion on Friday. That makes 2017 a ""transformative year"" for Shell, Van Beurden said.Cash flow from operations was $7.28 billion, compared with $7.58 billion the preceding quarter and $9.17 billion a year ago. Fourth-quarter oil and gas output was 3.76 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, compared with 3.91 million a year earlier.

Retailers led January's payrolls reductions, laying off 15,378 workers — almost 32% fewer cuts than the 22,491 layoffs announced in January last year.First-time unemployment claims were roughly even, at 231,000, in the week ended Jan. 27, the Labor Department said.

891,ADS,"The S&P 500 index and other major averages had their first down week of 2018, and it was their worst showing in two years. Apple (AAPL) guided lower, as many suspected. Amazon (AMZN) and Boeing (BA) delivered strong results while Facebook (FB) touted strong ad rates. Alibaba (BABA) missed on earnings. PayPal (PYPL) crashed as former parent eBay (EBAY) moved to cut ties. A move by Amazon, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) to team up to tackle health care costs hit insurers and pharmacy benefit managers.

Both narrowly beat expectations. Apple sold 77.3 million iPhones vs. the consensus for 80 million units, but average selling prices due to its new iPhone X and iPhone 8 models fueled overall results.

Traffic acquisition costs, what Google pays partner websites to carry ads, soared 33% to $6.45 billion. Google expects the rise in TAC to moderate after Q1. Google's rising TAC has been linked to a contract renewal with Apple as well as internet searches shifting to mobile phones. Revenue rose 24% to $32.32 billion, topping consensus. The adjusted EPS excluded the impact of tax reform, which resulted in additional expense of $9.9 billion.Amazon's Jeff Bezos, JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon and Berkshire's Warren Buffett said the new nonprofit company is aimed at reducing costs for their employees.

Pure-play PBM Express Scripts (ESRX) retreated 5.9%.PayPal (PYPL) reported strong earnings and in-line guidance, while former parent eBay (EBAY) reported in-line Q4 earnings but stronger-than-expected gross merchandise volume.

Earnings per U.S. share climbed 25%, but slightly missed forecasts. Alibaba will buy a 33% stake in Ant Financial, a former unit that runs payments service Alipay.

Average hourly wages surged 2.9% vs. a year earlier, far above views and the best since 2009. The ISM manufacturing index continued to point to raid employment gains. While fast growth and wage gains are good news, they could spur the Federal Reserve to raise rates more aggressively this year.The software leader reported adjusted earnings per share of 96 cents, up 20% year over year, on sales of $28.9 billion, up 12%, for its fiscal second quarter. Analysts expected 86 cents and $28.4 billion. Microsoft got a lift from its cloud computing businesses, including Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics.

897,ADS,"LAS VEGAS — At the massive CES consumer electronics show this week, Google was practically everywhere, promoting its Google Assistant voice-response technology and other initiatives, a stark contrast to last year's conference when rival Amazon (AMZN) cunningly took over the trade show with its Alexa voice assistant and Google was largely absent.X When considering winners and losers at CES 2018, Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google is a clear winner at the four-day show, which ended Friday. It received positive brand exposure for its ""Hey Google"" messaging, which is the voice-activation prompt for Google Home smart speakers and other devices. Google wrapped Las Vegas Monorail trains in ""Hey Google"" advertising, bought large display ads outside the Las Vegas Convention Center and purchased big video screen ads on the Strip and near the convention center.Google also set up a couple of giant gumball machines where CES attendees could ask the Google Assistant spoken questions and win prizes ranging from ""Hey Google"" winter caps and tote bags to Google Nest security cameras and Google Home Mini smart speakers. Google also had a large whimsical Google Assistant Playground where it provided tours and briefings on the company's hardware and software offerings. These exhibits were staffed with dozens of bubbly Google representatives dressed in white jumpsuits.Amazon had a lesser presence at the show, but seemed to match Google on the number of partnership announcements for getting voice controls into third-party products.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) was a no-show at CES again and missed an opportunity to be part of the conversation about voice assistants and the smart home with its Siri and HomeKit efforts.The biggest themes of this year's CES were artificial intelligence and the smart or connected home. All the major consumer electronics companies talked up their efforts to add AI to their devices so they are more predictive and helpful for their owners. Smart home discussions centered around voice-command interfaces and individual devices such as security cameras, lighting and thermostats.Another big topic at CES was the rise of augmented-reality glasses. AR headset maker Vuzix (VUZI) earned plaudits from tech reviewers for its Vuzix Blade Smart Glasses. For instance, U.K.-based consumer technology news and review site TechRadar named the Vuzix Blade glasses the Best AR on Show at CES 2018.The Blade glasses feature Amazon Alexa voice controls, so users can ask to play music, hear and display news or weather and more. AR glasses overlay digital information onto a wearer's field of vision.CES 2018: See The Latest Technology Trends & Top Tech StocksInternet television network Netflix (NFLX) generated a lot of buzz for a booth it sponsored in the Augmented Reality Marketplace at CES. The booth supposedly was for a company called Psychasec, but was really a marketing stunt for Netflix's upcoming science-fiction TV series ""Altered Carbon.""The Comic-Con style booth featured actors who discussed technology to achieve immortality. The company told visitors it would sell lab-grown human bodies called ""sleeves"" into which you could upload your memories and consciousness. At the end of each tour, the exhibit was revealed to be a promotion for the Netflix show.One of the big losers at CES 2018 was action-camera maker GoPro (GPRO), which on Monday preannounced weak holiday-quarter sales and said it is exiting the drone business. Observers noted how quiet GoPro's booth at CES was this year as the company's downbeat news cast a pall over the company's exhibit area.RELATED:Artificial Intelligence, 5G Wireless Seen Heralding New Data AgeCamera Makers Converge At CES To Combat 'Porch Pirates'Amazon Seeks 'Star Trek' Level Conversations For Alexa AssistantAmazon, Google Jockey For Spotlight At CES Tech Trade Show

Trump's doing that.X It's bad enough that the Obama-era CFPB has become a wet blanket on the small-business economy and on community banks, which increasingly find themselves tied up in costly CFPB red tape. But, thanks to CFPB mastermind Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the corrupt setup of the agency in effect turned it into a massive source of funding for left-wing groups.Fortunately, CFPB Acting Director Mick Mulvaney is closing the political ""slush fund"" the CFPB bureaucracy runs, courtesy of the fines it levies on the businesses it regulates. It's a great shakedown: the fines aren't transferred to the U.S. Treasury, as is normal. Instead, they supposedly go to compensate ""victims"" and ""educate"" the public. In reality, the money is forked over to far-left community groups, that use it to enlarge their influence and political clout.

905,ADS,"Futures for the S&P 500 index rose slightly early Monday morning. Several top-rated stocks that were notable winners in 2017 are moving toward fresh buy points. Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), IPG Photonics (IPGP) and Arista Networks (ANET) are five stocks that have formed bases recently and are approaching entries.XWal-Mart Stores and UnitedHealth are both Dow industrial components, each doubling the S&P 500's performance in 2017.  The latter three all more than doubled last year. Tencent Holdings is one of a slew of top-rated Chinese stocks near buy points. Laser maker IPG Photonics is on IBD's Rising Profit Estimates list while Arista Networks is an IBD 50 member.S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures rose less than 0.1% vs. fair value. Dow futures were up 0.2%.Wal-Mart Stores has been trading in a narrow range since hitting 100.13 on Nov. 17, a day after gapping up 11% on third-quarter earnings. Shares have trended up slightly for the past four weeks, rising as high as 100.38 on Friday, just exceeding a 100.23 flat-base buy point, before settling to close at 100.13.As Wal-Mart has consolidated, the Relative Strength line has drifted lower, reflecting the S&P 500 index's modest outperformance over that time. But the RS line did rise modestly for most of last year, as booming online sales and other steps convinced investors that Wal-Mart would be a survivor in the age of Amazon (AMZN) and even pose real challenges to the e-commerce giant.Wal-Mart rose 43% in 2017 vs. the S&P 500's 19% advance.Ideally, Wal-Mart would blast past its buy point in heavy volume, pushing the RS line to confirm the breakout and signal institutional support.Tencent Holdings is a Chinese messaging and online gaming giant, operating the uber-app WeChat. Tencent is the archrival of Alibaba (BABA) and owns a stake in JD.com (JD) and several other notable Chinese companies, as well as Tesla (TSLA).Tencent shares shot up 114% last year. Not surprisingly, the RS line climbing steadily during the year, reaching a recent peak on Nov. 21, when Tencent hit a record 56.05.  Shares fell sharply to the 50-day line but found support and quickly rebounded.Tencent rose 7.6% last week, far outpacing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, closing at 55.87 and finishing a 6-week cup base.UnitedHealth has just carved out a short flat base with a 231.87 buy point. Shares rose 3.75% last week to 228.73, setting a record close on Friday.The stock's RS line gradually rose from late February to the end of November. UnitedHealth's RS line is moving closer to that old high.IPG Photonics has just completed a cup-base pattern going back the minimum six weeks, giving it a 248.33 buy point. IPG Photonics tumbled from record highs in late November and early December. Shares then began to rebound, but for the rest of 2017 held below the still-rising 50-day line. IPG retook its 50-day line on Tuesday and then kept rising, surging 13% for the week to 242.34.IPG Photonics' RS line advanced in 2017, especially from July to late November. IPG shares leapt 117%Arista Networks was a huge 2017 winners, sprinting 143%.The stock is now in a cup-with-handle base with a 241.60 buy point. Handles offer a chance to shake out weak holders before the stock blasts out of a base. But the handle largely formed as the rest of the market had big gains, pushing the RS line lower last week despite a fractional stock gain. Ideally, the RS line should confirm at least a short-term high, like a handle, on a breakout. That might be challenging for Arista, unless it advances while the market pauses.Arista Networks closed Friday at 236.77.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:These 5 Top Techs Are Near Buys — Now Study The ChartsAdobe, PayPal Lead 5 Stocks Near Buy Points With Rising Earnings EstimatesThe Top 16 China Stocks Surge, In A Fast-Moving Start To 2018Bitcoin, Blockchain And Private Industry: You Ain't Seen Nothing YetDepartment Stores, Malls In 2018: Amazon Will Let You Live — For Now

912,ADS,"The major market averages were mostly unchanged in early trade Thursday, as they mounted a furious rebound following an early dive. Social media giant Facebook (FB) jumped to a new high in the stock market today.

The stock moved up over 2% to hit a fresh record high. Its 5% buy range from a 184.35 flat-base entry runs up to 193.57, so shares are barely still in buy range.Ferrari (RACE) raced 5% higher to break out past a 121.24 cup-shaped base buy point. Early Thursday, the luxury-car maker reported strong quarterly results.Meanwhile — after the closing bell — three tech heavyweights will report their quarterly results: Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL).Alphabet sits well-extended from a 1,006.29 flat-base buy point.

After the decision and statement, traders now see an 82% chance. That's according to data from CME Group FedWatch.X A 1% intraday gain for the Dow Jones industrial average faded to end with a 0.4% gain.

916,ADS,"Stocks were higher at midday Wednesday but gave back some gains, as the market tried to find its footing following Tuesday's broad slide.X The Dow Jones industrial average led with a 0.4% increase, a leap that came largely thanks to Boeing's (BA) 5% rally to an all-time high. Boeing today beat earnings expectations and gave an upbeat forecast on profit and revenue for the coming year.The S&P 500 was up 0.1% after being up as much as 0.6% in today's market. The Nasdaq also climbed around 0.1% as it also faded from early gains. The main indexes recovered only a fraction of Tuesday's sharp losses and were near session lows. As IBD's signature market analysis column, The Big Picture, has noted, the market has seemed frothy and a larger pullback would not be surprising.Volume was lower compared with the same time Tuesday. Breadth was mixed, with advancers over decliners by 6-to-5 on the NYSE but losers ahead on the Nasdaq by the same ratio.The small-cap Russell 2000 reversed lower and was down a fraction. The Dow transports, however, rose 0.6% as airline and trucking stocks were among the morning's top performers.Brazil-based airline Azul (AZUL) broke out of a cup-without-handle base, gapping past a 29.53 buy point. But volume was unimpressive.A few other breakouts also were fading, including insurer Chubb (CB) (which tried to top a 156.10 buy point) and chip company Aquantia (AQ) (13.90 entry). Chubb missed earnings estimates late Tuesday. Aquantia went public on Nov. 3 and is thinly traded with an average daily turnover of 224,000 shares.Internet retail also was one of the day's winners, as Amazon.com (AMZN) rose to a new high and extended a scorching advance.The stock has risen more than 20% from its 1,213.51 buy point, an increase that justifies taking profits. Amazon.com reports earnings Thursday after the close, and shareholders have the opportunity to lock in gains and sit out the earnings announcement, and thus the risk that comes with any quarterly report.Amazon has been a member of IBD Leaderboard since March 29, 2017.Homebuilders were bouncing back and were one of the 10 best industry groups this morning. D.R. Horton (DHI) beat earnings expectations Wednesday. But the stock met resistance at the 50-day moving average and erased most of its early gains. It was a disappointing move that failed to remove worries about the industry's ability to remain a market leader.Energy, recreational vehicle, steel and some retail industry groups were the weakest. U.S. crude prices fell 0.3% to $64.27 a barrel. Officials reported a surprisingly large build in domestic crude inventories while oil production increased again.The Innovator IBD 50 Fund (FFTY), an ETF that tracks the IBD 50 index, was only slightly higher but still endeavoring to rise from support at the key 50-day moving average.RELATED:Boeing Beats Q4 Earnings Forecast, Gives Strong GuidanceHomebuilder Giant D.R.

"
920,ADS,"Oil prices have started the new year at the highest levels since 2015, raising hopes for a sustained rally after more than three years of ups and downs that saw drastic role reversals among the industry's top players.X As investors sort out how much the industry will return to business as usual and how much a new normal will take root, here are five issues to watch:After prices crashed in 2014, oil giants took the unusual step of cutting dividends or halting buybacks to conserve cash. But they appear to have turned a corner last year after reining in investments and selling some assets. U.S. tax cuts will also free up more capital that could be returned to shareholders.In November, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) announced it would pay its first full dividend since 2015 and said that it would buy back at least $25 billion. In October, BP (BP) said it would buy back shares for the first time in three years. Look to Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) to see what they will do on dividends and buybacks.Collectively, oil companies aren't expected to dump cash into oil fields even if prices rebound. Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said investment in exploration will fall 7% this year to $37 billion vs. 2016 and will be down 60% from a peak in 2014. Spending by oil majors is expected to fall 4% but drilling is expected to rise slightly.Shale producers could make or break oil's rally after their emergence as market disrupters prompted OPEC in 2014 to step back from its swing producer role by allowing prices to sink.This past fall, U.S. exploration and production companies signaled that they are shifting their focus to cash-flow discipline rather than increasing spending to chase rising oil prices.""Investment community wants to start seeing a bit more upside. They are interested in profits rather than production. I would expect that to continue,"" said Jim Krane, an energy analyst at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy.But Tom O'Donnell, a senior energy analyst at the consulting firm Wikistrat, doesn't think shale will remain disciplined for long, despite assurances from Continental Resources (CLR) CEO Harold Hamm.""When it looks like OPEC is getting control of the market that's when the other guys come back and the spotlight will be on them,"" O'Donnell said.Either way, output will keep rising, testing OPEC's plans to curb its own production to prop up crude. The Energy Information Administration expects U.S. production to hit 10 million barrels per day by the second-half of the year as companies like EOG Resources (EOG), Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and Apache (APA) cut costs and improve well output.The world's top oil exporter is preparing for an IPO of its state-run oil giant and changed Saudi Aramco's status to a joint stock company at the start of the year to get it ready for a listing.The company's $2 trillion valuation would make it the world's largest publicly traded company and a 5% offering would make the IPO the biggest ever in proceeds generated. While exchanges in London and New York are jockeying to get a piece of the action, watch for a private placement of Aramco shares with China playing a major role.A private placement is easier than jumping through all the hoops the SEC would demand from a U.S. listing and it will also save the kingdom a lot of embarrassment if the company doesn't fetch it's lofty IPO price, said the Baker Institute's Krane.""It also links them up, creates a mutual dependence between Saudi Arabia and China, which is exactly what Aramco needs if it wants to stay in the game as oil demand starts to slip in the developed world,"" he added.Also be on the lookout for additional moves in U.S. shale. Saudi Arabia is reportedly looking at natural-gas assets in the Permian and Eagle Ford shale formations and is in talks with Tellurian (TELL), a U.S. liquefied natgas producer, as it looks to break into U.S. shale, according to the Wall Street Journal.Investing in shale would give Saudi Arabia access to the U.S. industry's ability to quickly start and stop production projects and use that knowledge back at home.""Saudi Arabia has a lot of shale, a lot of tight gas,"" Krane said. ""Aramco needs to get to the gas because Saudi Arabia is very short on natural gas. The only way to get to it without imports is to tap into shale.""The oil group will have a tricky balancing act this year as it tries to keep U.S. shale at bay, its own members in line and oil prices in a sweet spot.At OPEC's November meeting, Saudi Energy Minster Khalid Al-Falih said that ""the contribution of shale is going to be very much manageable"" next year.But the International Energy Agency has said 2018 ""might not be quite so happy for OPEC producers"" as U.S. output increases.Still, OPEC sees markets rebalancing late this year after agreeing in November to extend its production-cut deal to the end of 2018.OPEC's resolve will be tested if crude prices rise enough to trigger more shale growth and increasing calls from its own members to lift production cuts. In December, Kuwait's oil minister suggested that members will discuss an exit strategy at the biannual meeting in June.The Trump administration is making moves to roll back energy regulations. The Interior Department's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement wants to remove regulations that were enacted after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill that killed 11 people and released 4.9 million barrels of oil in the Gulf of Mexico.And on Thursday, the Interior Department issued a draft proposal to open about 90% of the U.S. outer continental shelf to offshore drilling leases between 2019 and 2024, in what would be the largest lease sale ever.Whether companies would actually boost offshore drilling is another story, as such ventures are typically costlier and require higher crude prices to be attractive.Despite the Trump administration's moves, the ending of the U.S. oil-export ban while Barack Obama was president will likely remain a bigger factor for U.S. energy producers.""The biggest energy steps were taken by Obama, the natural gas and oil exports, those were the big steps and now the opening of drilling and cutting some regulations on emissions is probably going to be small potatoes to legalizing exports,"" Krane said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, Coal

921,ADS,"Headlines are constantly vying for your attention but when putting hard-earned money at risk in an investment, you want some substance to the story. That long has been a selling point to The New America feature in Investor's Business Daily, and 2017 provided a good reason why.X The names highlighted in The New America this past year had stellar performances as a whole. In an IBD index based on the New America names, the 2017 performance was 30.4% vs. 19.4% for the S&P 500. The index assumes a holding period for a stock is six months from its publication in the feature.How is that accomplished? By applying a key tenet of IBD's investing philosophy: It's just not fundamental or technical analysis, it's both.The technical analyses often seem to garner a disproportionate amount of real estate with stock prices, chart scrutiny and discussions of base patterns.However, the elements of what the company does, its earnings growth, balance sheets, and income statements are often more important in your stock selection.Ratings such as the Earnings Per Share Rating and Sales/Margins/Return on Equity Rating give you a good starting point in stock screening, but the New America dives deeper to get behind the numbers.What are the opportunities for future earnings growth? What is the competition like? How do customers, management and analysts view the company? Understanding the details of the company gives you a leg up on playing the stock for a profit.The New America selection isn't based on fundamentals alone. In keeping with the IBD principles, companies selected also need to display technical strength.Relative strength, signs of institutional sponsorship and developing chart patterns inform the selection process. The technical selection process helps weed out weaker stocks and gives readers a more focused list of names that could be actionable soon. The combination is critical.The 57% advantage the New America Index has over the S&P 500 may seem rewarding by itself but that's really just a starting point. Chart reading and portfolio management principles applied to the names can significantly improve those results.Charts help with the timing of your buys and sells but the fundamentals guide you on what to buy in the first place and which stocks might be worth holding for larger gains.Take Planet Fitness (PLNT), featured on Feb. 13. A flat base was in the process of forming at the time and The New America put the stock on investors' radar prior to a breakout. A savvy investor wouldn't have made the purchase at that time, because it didn't break out until three months later on May 25. That was after a new base formed and offered an even lower entry opportunity.Planet Fitness exited the New America Index six months after its entry, in the middle of August. Here again, an investor using charts and portfolio management rules would most likely view the new flat base as another buying opportunity rather than a time to sell.The 13% gain Planet Fitness contributed to the New America index over six months could have easily turned into a 63% gain over seven months. The improvement was simply by delaying the entry until a breakout and holding until the end of the year since the stock never triggered any sell rules.The New America is just one element to your stock research process. Once you understand the company, you should also look at a chart to see where the stock is trading.Is it basing in a sound pattern? Is it extended and needing time to consolidate gains? No matter how great the company story is, it doesn't guarantee the stock will go up in price. Charts act as a critical supplement to the information gleaned from the article.That was the case with Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI) in July. The stock broke out in May and pulled back after making gains of 20%. At the time of the article, the best course of action would be to wait for a consolidation or a bounce off the 10-week line.Neither happened for Macom. A 25% drop after an earnings report ruined the look of the chart. While the New America Index suffered the loss, anyone looking at a chart would have avoided the stock.The New America acts as both an idea generator and a research tool. Maybe you recognize a compelling chart pattern as you're scanning the names in the IBD 50 list. Before just buying a stock based on the chart, you can do a deeper dive to understand the company's prospects.The company most likely won't be featured in The New America that day, but you can view the archives to see the most recent articles and filter by feature. Sometimes, the extra knowledge of what the company does can be a deciding factor of whether this will be a stock to hold for a larger gain.The story behind Alibaba (BABA) was certainly compelling when featured in the last quarter of 2016. Alibaba was in the process of forming a cup with handle at the time. But, when it broke out in March it quickly turned into one of the biggest leaders of 2017 with a gain over 80% from the breakout.The New America won't make the buy decisions for you, but it can certainly give you the tools to make informed decisions for yourself.RELATED:Planet Fitness Bumps 'Gymtimidation' Lunks To Powerlift Its GymsMacom Sees Gold In Mining The Silver Linings Of Data CloudsTwo Years After Its Blockbuster IPO, Alibaba Ready To Take On World

925,ADS,"Tesaro (TSRO) shares kicked off 2018 by hitting an 18-month low after an analyst cut his estimates on the company's cancer drug, Zejula, noting the medication has been associated with more hospitalizations than AstraZeneca's (AZN) Lynparza.X By the closing bell on the stock market today, Tesaro dove 8.8% to finish at 75.62. Shares hit a low last seen in July 2016. Meanwhile, shares of AstraZeneca rose 2% 35.38. Shares of Clovis Oncology (CLVS), another rival, fell 2.9% to 66.05.Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond cut his price target on Tesaro to 80 from 117, though he kept his neutral rating on the stock. He sees Tesaro's drug, Zejula, pulling in $48 million in fourth-quarter sales, down from earlier views for $53 million.""Essentially, we believe initial assumptions around duration of therapy, dose and market share are too high,"" he said in a note to clients. ""Given this, we would expect to see consensus numbers come down as we move into 2018.""Zejula is approved as a maintenance treatment for some patients with ovarian cancer who either partially or completely responded to chemotherapy. It belongs to a class of drugs called PARP inhibitors which includes Clovis' Rubraca and Lynparza.Rubraca is approved to treat ovarian cancer patients with a specific mutation who have undergone at least two rounds of chemotherapy. Lynparza is approved to treat patients with the same mutation after at least three rounds of chemo and as a maintenance therapy.IBD'S TAKE: Mergers and acquisitions could help stoke the embers under the biotech group, but look unlikely as chief executives today are less experienced than they were 10 years ago. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a breakdown on what CEO experience could mean for business development among the group's leaders.For 2018, 2019 and 2020, Raymond expects Tesaro's Zejula to generate $285 million, $433 million and $603 million in sales, respectively. The consensus is much higher with views of $49 million for the fourth quarter and $335 million for 2018.Tesaro notes 40% of patients are on the 100-milligram dose of Zejula with 40% on 200-milligram and 20% on 300-milligram. Patients who move to a lower dose generally take a monthlong break for the drug, consistent with the label instructions.""This math makes for an average quarterly net revenue per patient of closer to $16,700 vs. our modeled $21,000,"" Raymond said. ""About 30% of patient starts so far have been treatment rather than maintenance, meaning many initial patients are now beginning to roll off therapy.""Further, according to Food and Drug Administration data, the incidence of hospitalization as a result of adverse events is 40% higher for patients treated with Zejula than Lynparza.""We caution investors that the FDA's (Adverse Event Reporting System) data is likely incomplete and possibly inaccurate,"" he said. ""That said, the signal is nonetheless striking — an issue we fear could impede efforts with respect to PARP market share.""RELATED:Why These Biotech Stocks Could Be Taken Over In 2018Tesaro Takes A Swipe At AstraZeneca's Ovarian Cancer Drug SalesWhy Tesaro's $2 Million Cancer-Drug Miss Prompted Its Rivals To Topple

Meanwhile, young Chinese adults are eager to adopt credit-fueled consumer spending.""Younger Chinese who come to the U.S. to study have grown used to credit cards,"" said Brendan Ahern, chief investment officer of KraneShares. ""There's a migration to using credit that was never seen a decade ago. China was pure cash-based.""That's where Shenzhen-based LexinFintech has stepped up and tapped into those trends. The company's online shopping mall, Fenqile, targets young Chinese adults who are willing and eager to borrow money to pay for their smartphones, DSLR cameras, beauty products and more.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNow the online lender seems poised for sharp growth in a nation that now stands in stark contrast to the China that was once doggedly averse to debt.Older adults in China remember what it was like before the boom years and still abhor the use of credit, Ahern said.But younger adults have only known a rapidly growing China, and have few qualms about credit. In fact, they see installment plans as a helpful means to pay more for the brands and products they like, LexinFintech says.Chinese online sales giant JD.com (JD) is a significant investor in LexinFintech. Many of the online lender's management team, including founder and Chief Executive Jay Wenjie Xiao, worked earlier for Chinese titan Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) or its online payment unit Tenpay. Tencent is JD.com's top shareholder as the duo boast a strategic alliance.LexinFintech surged in its stock market debut on Dec. 21, closing up 19% at 10.73 from its initial public offering price of 9.Then shares shot up in heavy volume on March 9, clearing an 18.39 buy point in an IPO base. Since then, they settled back but started climbing again and were up 4.3% to around 18 in afternoon action on Monday.LexinFintech already is profitable, with huge growth seen. Total operating revenue from Jan. 1-Sept. 30 of 2017 rose 35% in local currency to the U.S. equivalent of roughly $599 million. It earned a net $21 million for the period, reversing from a net loss a year earlier.According to Yahoo Finance, analysts expect LexinFintech to earn 29 cents a share for fiscal 2017, and $1.53 for fiscal 2018.During LexinFintech's IPO roadshow, investors fretted about China's regulatory climate. Shares of industry peers and fellow IPOs Qudian (QD), Jianpu Technology (JT) and PPDAI Group (PPDF) got whacked around that time as Beijing cracked down on online and microcredit lending.""China is trying to put the brakes on the blistering, yet haphazard growth, of the country's online micro-lenders,"" Reuters reported at that time.However, LexinFintech said it welcomed the new rules, saying they would make it harder for newcomers to enter the industry.The company had 3.3 million active customers in the first nine months of 2017, up 34% from the year-earlier period. More than 90% of its customers were young, educated adults aged 18 to 36, a group it calls ""underserved"" by traditional financial institutions in China.It has grown this client base by leveraging technologies such as Big Data and artificial intelligence both to assess credit risks and to pair users with diverse funding sources.Loan partners include commercial banks, consumer finance companies, other licensed institutions and individual investors.From its start in 2013 through Sept. 30, 2017, LexinFintech originated $9 billion in loans. Loan originations grew 124% in the first nine months of 2017 vs. the same period a year earlier.Customer loan balances are getting bigger. The average balance was roughly $1,418 in the third quarter, according to LexinFintech's IPO prospectus, up 50.5% in local currency from a year earlier and nearly triple the average in the third quarter of 2015.Investors should pay attention to delinquency rates, especially for a small, foreign upstart with rapid-fire growth in rapidly evolving marketplace.But LexinFintech, in its prospectus, said just 1.3% of its outstanding balance was 30 days delinquent in the third quarter of 2017. That's down from 1.7% in the second quarter and 2.2% two years earlier.According to LexinFintech, installment payments in China should keep rising as consumers start to use them more regularly for smaller-ticket purchases, such as shoes and cosmetics.Usage is also spreading from large coastal cities to China's interior regions, and from low- to high-income earners, it says.Qudian and another Chinese lender, Yirendai (YRD), will report earnings next week.(Editor's note: This story was updated with earnings estimates from Yahoo Finance.)YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:New Addition To The IPO Leaders Nears A Potential Buy Point Top Chinese Internet Stock Jumps On Q4 Earnings Beat, Then ReversesWhat Do Facebook, Grubhub, Salesforce Have In Common With This Stock?

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOver the past week or so, Facebook, Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Oracle (ORCL), Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) and China Lodging Group (HTHT) sold off sharply after setting up in bases with proper buy points. These are great examples of why investors should wait for a proper breakout and resist the temptation to buy shares early.Oracle, Tencent and China Lodging all sold off recently on earnings reports, always a high risk/high reward situation.Facebook tumbled this week on news that a third party had data on 50 million users, with Facebook's long-term policies and its short-term response coming under fire. Alphabet retreated along with Facebook, as investors worried about the potential fallout on U.S. consumer internet giants from consumers, advertisers and regulators.Facebook and Alphabet had just finished cup-with-handle bases last Friday, when the Cambridge Analytica reports hit that evening and over the weekend. Facebook fell 9% over Monday-Tuesday, crashing through its 50-day and 200-day moving averages before rising slightly Wednesday. But shares were down 2% early Thursday, following Zuckerberg's Wednesday night interview with CNN in which he expressed his regret for the breach of trust.Alphabet has retreated 3.5% through Wednesday, below its 50-day line.Oracle topped a 53.24 last week, but never closed above that level. Shares were still close when Oracle reported better-than-expected earnings Monday night. But investors focused on weaker-than-expected cloud revenue growth, which slowed from the prior quarter, and guidance for continued deceleration in cloud revenue gains. Oracle plunged 9.4% on Tuesday.The Chinese internet giant topped earnings estimates early Thursday, but revenue growth came in a little light. Tencent, which had been 3% off a cup base buy point, sold off 3%. Tencent did hold above its 50-day line and the messaging and gaming titan could soon form a handle, creating a lower buy point. But buying now would simply recreate the same potential risk.China Lodging was working on a late-stage cup-with-handle base last week. Shares closed March 14 below the 50-day line, which was not a great sign. Then China Lodging came up short with its earnings report, sending the stock tumbling 10% the next session.Watching a top-rated stock move up in a base, waiting for it to clear a proper buy point can make investors restless. You might think to yourself that you can save a percentage point or two by buying a stock just below a buy point. But that's literally penny wise, pound foolish. If a stock is going to blast out of a base and run up sharply, the fractional additional gain won't matter. But if the stock falls back, you're can be stuck with a loss.A breakout maximizes your chances of winning, winning now and winning big. With the stock at or near a new high, essentially every investor is happy. No one is desperate to sell. To add shares, mutual funds have to bid up the price.Conversely, if you buy just below a buy point, that's when weak holders are deciding whether or not to bow out. Weak holders may have bought the stock at the prior high. After holding on and finally seeing a stock get back to break-even, they may start to sell. That's a reason why handles will often form in stocks before breaking out, and those modest pullbacks also encourage further selling.Ideally, selling is modest, and the stock can then power ahead. But sometimes a stock near a breakout and then pull back significantly over the short- or long-term.Obviously, bad news, whether stock-specific, industrywide and the broader market, can strike at any time. But with a breakout, if the stock performs poorly, there are clear technical signals. If a stock has run up some, you'll have a cushion so you can weather the sell-off or take profits, usually avoiding a loss.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: 4 Reasons Why The Market Reversal Wasn't So BadSee Which Stocks Just Got Added To – Or Cut From – IBD's Top Stock Lists Fed Rate Hike Is No Surprise, But Stock Market Weakens On Powell, 2019 Outlook

934,ADS,"If China has its own version of the FANG stocks, you could find it in KraneShares CSI China Internet (KWEB).Just as in the U.S. Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are known as the FANG stocks, there are Chinese companies that resemble most of those U.S. internet heavyweights.JD.com (JD), Baidu (BIDU), Tencent (TCEHY) are major online retail, search engine and social media companies in China, and all are major holdings of KraneShares China Internet. IQiyi, a Netflix-type video streaming service, is majority-owned by Baidu and is going public on the Nasdaq later this month.KraneShares China Internet was an unremarkable ETF until a year ago. The ETF had periods of outperformance against the S&P 500 but was mainly in a horizontal trend between 26 and about 42 from its launch in July 2013 to March 2017.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThen, a breakout in March 2017 sent the ETF on its most successful advance so far, rising about 67% until a peak on Jan. 26. The ETF has been forming a new base since then. The potential buy point is 68.49.The ETF's popularity has grown in the past year, judging from a big increase in average daily volume starting in March 2017. Today, the ETF has $1.8 billion in assets. A year ago, it had nearly $285 million in assets, according to KraneShares.Many of the fund's biggest holdings have put in good performances over that yearlong run, although the ETF has shadowed Tencent's progress most closely. Tencent — the largest holding with more than 10% of assets — has more than doubled since shares started making new highs a year ago.Tencent is a messaging and gaming giant that is also the world's largest gaming company. Its WeChat social media app has more than 1 billion monthly active users. Tencent accounts for about 60% of all mobile online time spent in China.Weibo (WB), among  the ETF's top 10 holdings, is known as China's Twitter (TWTR). The stock has risen roughly 130% since a breakout last May and a couple of bases since then.KraneShares China Internet has more than 30 holdings. Many trade in the U.S. but some holdings trade in China or Hong Kong exchanges.No doubt, China's internet sector is one of the big growth stories. China's internet population as of 2016 was more than double the U.S.' Yet, only about 52% of China had internet access, creating a long runway of potential growth, KraneShares says.RELATED:'China's Amazon' JD.com Has These Futuristic Projects In The WorksPayPal Vs.

935,ADS,"Online retail sales in China are off to a strong start for the year, creating upside potential for e-commerce leader Alibaba (BABA).China's National Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday reported online retail sales in the country reached $205.8 billion for the first two months of 2018. That's up 37% from the year-ago quarter and an acceleration in growth from the 32% increase for the same period a year ago.

Those moves fueled further uncertainty for staff at a company that's lost key executives and released a widely criticized product redesign.The rolling cuts are in part a response to over-hiring as Snap scrambled to build an advertising business and release new products, aiming to carve out a larger slice of a consumer tech market dominated by Facebook (FB) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google.After Snap's initial public offering a year ago, the company reported three straight quarters of disappointing revenue growth before finally delivering sales that blew past estimates in February.The Venice, Calif.-based company was changing the way its ads were sold, moving to an automated bidding process that allowed more kinds of marketers to participate, but dropped the average price of an ad dramatically.Snap shares slipped 0.5% to 15.87 at the close Thursday.

937,ADS,"China will open up its massive electronic-payments market to foreign companies, a move that would pit newcomers against licensed, already established firms in the nation such as Tencent's (TCEHY) WeChat Pay and Alibaba (BABA)-backed Ant Financial's Alipay.XCompanies that apply for a payments license in China will need to store the information they collect within the nation's borders. Those firms will also need to establish a commercial presence in China, payment service facilities and disaster-recovery systems.The decision, the People's Bank of China said on Wednesday, was intended to encourage innovation and competition. But it also comes as President Trump, who has long complained that China has taken advantage of the U.S. on trade, readies a plan to hit the country with at least $30 billion in tariffs.The loosening of the payments market comes after Beijing last year eased rules for foreign banks to do business in China, potentially allowing U.S. giants like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) to increase their presence in retail banking and financial services.JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo (WFC) are also among the more than 30 U.S. banks that are in a consortium for mobile payment service Zelle, which transferred $75 billion through 247 million transactions in 2017.PayPal (PYPL), which owns Venmo, already has ties in China.

941,ADS,"Imagine being told one day that your paychecks would be in Bitcoin. Pretty cool, right? Except your liquid assets could tumble in value at any moment in this cryptocurrency future. And you'd have to convert your cryptocurrency to dollars to buy groceries at Walmart (WMT), coffee at Starbucks (SBUX) or books on Amazon (AMZN).The surge in value of Bitcoin and its digital currency rivals has not been matched by their everyday utility. Payment processor Stripe cut off Bitcoin support in January, citing slow transaction times and high fees.""We've seen the desire from our customers to accept Bitcoin decrease,"" explained Stripe product manager Tom Karlo.Bitcoin and other digital rivals are nowhere near ready for prime time. They might never match the utility of today's financial-system incumbents, the banks and payment companies that facilitate the flow of funds over tens of millions of merchant locations.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseYet much like millennials will never have a landline, a coming generation might do without bank accounts thanks to secure, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions. Blockchain technology and the vast new crypto wealth have opened the door to four cryptocurrency futures that could usher in a new financial order.What are these possibilities?""Virtual currencies might just give existing currencies and monetary policy a run for their money,"" International Monetary Fund director Christine Lagarde predicted last fall. ""Citizens may one day prefer virtual currencies, since they potentially offer the same cost and convenience as cash — no settlement risks, no clearing delays, no central registration, no intermediary to check accounts and identities,"" she said.That explosive potential helps explain why so many tech entrepreneurs and investors turned cryptocurrencies into a 21st Century gold rush, even as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon has trashed Bitcoin as ""a fraud.""Dimon and other titans of finance voice certainty that commercial banks will remain indispensable, cryptocurrencies will stay on the fringe, and governments will want to keep it that way.Blockchain's potential to revolutionize the financial system has some central banks studying whether to issue their own digital currency. Yale University scholars have proposed the FedCoin. In this cryptocurrency future, FedCoin could make monetary policy more flexible and forceful, even allowing for negative interest rates.If a cryptocurrency acted as a reliable, widely accepted store of value, people could cut ties to their banks. They could keep some crypto cash in digital wallets, with other liquid assets in mutual funds, stocks and government bonds.A Bank of England study concluded that a central-bank cryptocurrency could boost GDP by 3%. Gains would come, in part, from shrinking ""monetary transaction costs that are analogous to distortionary tax rates.""Yet FedCoin looks far-fetched at present because of the massive disruption it could cause. Central bank crypto dollars ""could endanger the economically and socially important financial intermediation function of commercial banks,"" JPMorgan analysts warned.The contribution of fractional reserve banking to global growth — turning each $1 of deposits into $10 in loans — could fade. ""We would expect that central banks would think twice before disturbing this source of capital to the private sector."" Dimon is surely right about one thing: The cryptocurrency future will depend heavily on government. That could mean smothering it with regulation, stealing its thunder via FedCoin or cultivating it with a light regulatory touch.Bitcoin hit its 2018 low early on Feb. 6, the morning of a key Senate cryptocurrency hearing, briefly undercutting $6,000. The chairmen of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission both urged stronger oversight. But the financial regulators stopped short of sounding an alarm. Nor did they call for any legislation to rein in cryptocurrencies. In the weeks after that hearing, Bitcoin rebounded to around $11,000 but it has retreated yet again to below $7,000.Bitcoin had doubled in the first half of December, hitting a peak above $19,000 just as Bitcoin futures began trading on Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) and CME (CME). The anticipation of futures trading, touted as validation from U.S. regulators, stoked speculation.At the Senate hearing, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., who earned his fortune as an early investor in the cell phone industry, said he sees a parallel between mobile phones then and cryptocurrencies now. ""The same kind of transformation is about to take place,"" he said.Warner criticized the CFTC for embracing Bitcoin options at this stage. He fretted that total cryptocurrency market capitalization could hit $20 trillion — vs. $300 billion now — with another 2017-like surge.""This rises potentially to the level of a systemically relevant event,"" Warner said.Yet there's reason to doubt that cryptocurrency frenzy will return. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) — Ma Bell in Warner's analogy — banned credit-card purchases of cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, the SEC and foreign governments have cracked down on initial coin offerings. And lately, Alphabet (GOOGL)-unit Google, Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR) have banned cryptocurrency ads.Even Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin warned via Twitter not long ago that cryptocurrencies ""could drop to near-zero at any time."" He added that ""traditional assets are still your safest bet.""The Bank for International Settlements, the central banker for global central banks, has warned that cryptocurrencies in the future could become a ""threat to financial stability"" if regulators aren't vigilant. U.S. regulators appear to be playing catch-up. As of Feb. 6, the cryptocurrency working group put together by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had held a single meeting.Politicians and central bankers worry that cryptocurrencies won't hold value in a panic. ""When things really go bad, where do Americans turn?"" Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker asked a fintech conference last fall. ""Well, they're going to come back to the government. That's the history of the country.""Harker did allow that other currency models might work if another ""large player"" besides the government provided trust.Who could fill that role? Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz offered some thoughts on the coffee chain's January earnings call.""I personally believe that there is going to be one or a few legitimate, trusted digital currencies off of the blockchain technology,"" Schultz said. He doubted that Bitcoin would be one of them.Cryptocurrencies ""will have to be legitimized by a brand in a brick-and-mortar environment, where the consumer has trust and confidence in the company that is providing the transaction.""Starbucks wants to play a role but isn't making a big investment in a cryptocurrency future right now, Schultz said.Cryptocurrency investors have speculated that Amazon might accept Bitcoin or one of its digital rivals. That specific cryptocurrency would vault past competitors as a trusted store of value and useful medium of exchange. Amazon even registered the domains AmazonEthereum.com, AmazonCryptocurrency.com and AmazonCryptocurrencies, kicking such talk into high gear.Alternatively, Amazon, Walmart — or a consortium of large companies — might issue their own cryptocurrency. Doing so could let them save on transaction costs and act as a competitive weapon.But Amazon has also been cozying up with JPMorgan. Recently, Amazon and JPMorgan have partnered in a health care venture and in creating a new type of bank account.Yet imagine if Amazon or Walmart rewarded loyal customers with tokens that could escalate in value. The tokens would jump to the head of the cryptocurrency pack with potential for broad acceptance as a currency. Customers would likely hoard the tokens, rather than spend them. The effect on sales and profits might be electric.For a digital currency to gain wide acceptance from outside businesses, the issuer would have to act like a central bank. Governing a currency requires trust, so some functions might need independence from corporate issuers.Those milestones could ease fears of a massive cryptocurrency crash. The Fed shouldn't need to rush in and save the day if AmazonCoin or WalmartCoin crashed.Currencies rely on conservative and predictable rules to assure the public that massive money printing won't destroy value. Could people trust the central bank of Amazon?Then again, will people always be able to count on the Fed?The Fed controls the creation of money, but central bankers seem to be losing their grip. Any loss of faith in the dollar and the Fed bodes well for a cryptocurrency future as dollar-skeptics look for an alternative store of wealth — besides gold.Bitcoin's peer-to-peer electronic payment system, first proposed in 2008 to verify transactions through a decentralized public blockchain, arrived on the scene as the global financial crisis triggered bailouts of one big bank after another.Bitcoin fulfilled famed economist Friedrich Hayek's idea of denationalizing money. He believed competition could help keep central banks honest and prevent runaway inflation.Doubts fueled by ""ballooning balance sheets of the major central banks in the aftermath of the global financial crisis"" motivated early cryptocurrency investors, JPMorgan analysts wrote. Yet the lack of any upsurge in inflation since ""has surely reduced concerns about fiat (legal tender issued by a central bank) money.""Yet the Fed now faces a much different challenge: a runaway federal deficit even amid a strong U.S. economy. The deficit will top $1 trillion in fiscal 2019 and $2 trillion by 2027, and there's no fix in sight. Republicans have overseen big deficit-financed tax cuts and increased government spending. Democrats want more generous Social Security benefits, Medicare for all and debt-free college.""The continued growth of public debt raises eventual sustainability questions if left unchecked,"" Goldman Sachs economists warned recently.The Fed seems on track to suffer the same fate as the Bank of Japan. The BoJ has been forced to accommodate sky-high government deficits with easy money and asset purchases. Japan, with a falling working-age population, hasn't had a whiff of inflation. But the U.S. might be a different story.Deutsche Bank global credit strategist Jim Reid put this shocking headline on a November report: ""The Start of the End of Fiat Money?"" Reid argued high debt levels will keep the Fed and other central banks too accommodative, putting fiat currencies at risk.""The fiat currency system may be seriously tested over the coming decade and ultimately we may need to find an alternative,"" Reid wrote. ""Cryptocurrencies are all the rage at the moment and are as much about blockchain as anything else, but there could be an increasing desire for alternative"" mediums of exchange in the years to come.""Keep in mind that fiat money is a relatively young innovation.

943,ADS,"Oil prices rose Friday after Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of OPEC, reportedly hinted that the cartel would continue coordinating production cuts with non-OPEC members into 2019.XU.S. crude futures rose 2.5% to $65.88 a barrel, for a 5.6% weekly gain. Brent crude climbed 2.2% to $70.45. Shares of Exxon Mobil (XOM) fell 0.8% on the stock market today. Chevron (CVX) lost 0.6%. BP (BP) gained 0.2%, and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) added 0.1%.At its last meeting in November, the cartel and key partners like Russia agreed to wind down their strategy of keeping 1.8 million barrels off the market daily by the end of this year. During the CERAWeek conference in Houston earlier this month, OPEC and Russia signaled they will  continue their alliance beyond 2018, but stopped short of saying the production cuts should be extended too.The flood of oil from U.S. shale producers has been weighing on prices, however, and the International Energy Agency warned this month that OPEC and its partners would need to reconsider their plans to accommodate all the extra supply. Now, Saudi Arabia appears to be reconsidering.""We know for sure that we still have some time to go before we bring inventories down to the level we consider normal and we will identify that by midyear when we meet in Vienna,"" Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told Reuters late Thursday. ""And then we will hopefully by year-end identify the mechanism by which we will work in 2019.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

945,ADS,"A German biotech with the potential to rival Gilead Sciences (GILD), Novartis (NVS) and Celgene (CELG) in cancer drugs is looking to raise $150 million in a Nasdaq initial public offering, according to a recent filing.MorphoSys filed its registration statement in the U.S. on Thursday. It hasn't yet priced the IPO, but in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing said it plans to raise $150 million. That would help line its coffers as MorphoSys plows ahead with a late-stage oncology drug.The firm's late-stage treatment would rival approved drugs called CAR-T therapies, which aim to teach a patient's immune system to identify and fight cancer. Novartis and Gilead crossed the finish line last year with CAR-T treatments called Kymriah and Yescarta, respectively.Kymriah is used to treat a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients age 25 and younger. Novartis is also seeking approval for Kymriah in a disease called diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, where Gilead's Yescarta is already approved.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLike Kymriah and Yescarta, MorphoSys' drug called MOR208 targets an antigen called CD19. Unlike Kymriah and Yescarta, MOR208 isn't a CAR-T drug; it belongs to a class called monoclonal antibodies. It's being developed to treat diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.MorphoSys recently unveiled strong results for MOR208 in combination with lenalidomide, sold by Celgene under the brand name Revlimid, in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The trial is still ongoing, MorphoSys said in a news release earlier this month.Preliminary results show patients achieved a median progression-free survival rate of 50.4% after 12 months of treatment. Overall, 49% of patients responded to the regimen with 31% having a complete response. The regimen was also well tolerated with no unexpected toxicities.In earlier-stage testing, MorphoSys is also working on a therapy for multiple myeloma called MOR202. This could rival drugs from Celgene — via Celgene's acquisition of Juno Therapeutics. Celgene is looking at CAR-T treatments for multiple myeloma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and other blood cancers.The German biotech also has developed and licensed a drug to GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) being investigated in rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, an eczema drug in development with partner Galapagos (GLPG), and another drug being looked at for its anti-tumor properties.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Tame A Volatile Swing Trade With A Half PositionLooking For The Next Nvidia?

Analysts said Alder is looking for an executive with more regulatory and commercial experience as the biotech prepares to submit its application for eptinezumab.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan called the move ""reasonable,"" but surprising considering a new full-time replacement has yet to be identified. Leerink's Porges suggested the transition could have already been planned, but kept under wraps pending pivotal trial data.""This timing and disclosure, which obviously came directly from the board of directors, means that the company is free to openly recruit a leader with the requisite skills and experience or to secure the sale of the company,"" Porges said.Needham analyst Danielle Brill suggested the sudden departure of Schatzman could slightly delay the timing for eptinezumab. But she noted the strategy for eptinezumab is unchanged. Alder is still planning to target about 3,000 specialists with a sales force of 75-125 people.Any delay in eptinezumab could be a headwind, Credit Suisse's Divan said. Eptinezumab is part of a drug class called anti-CGRPs, which target a specific peptide to prevent migraines. Amgen (AMGN)/Novartis (NVS), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) are all working in this market.Divan noted the first-quarter conference call will be key on the timing of eptinezumab where ""a delay of even a few months could be very meaningful.""""We also remain concerned as to how (Alder) will compete against three larger players who are well ahead of them in development in a market that will likely also face significant pricing pressures,"" he said.RELATED:How To Build Long-Term Profits In Stocks?

958,ADS,"Regulation: As Facebook's privacy crisis grows, so too are calls for the government to regulate it, including from Republicans, the tech industry and Mark Zuckerberg himself. What could be wrong with that?Utah Republican Rep. Chris Stewart, for example, told CNN that ""I actually think it probably is"" time to regulate Facebook (FB) and other social media companies because ""these companies gather our private information and they monetize it.""Speaking at a China Development Forum in Beijing, Apple (APPL) Chairman Tim Cook said, when asked about Facebook, ""I think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary.""Zuckerberg himself says that ""I'm not sure we shouldn't be regulated,"" adding that ""I actually think the question is more 'What is the right regulation?' rather than 'Yes or no, should it be regulated?' ""So, with everyone seemingly in agreement — including the very company at the heart of the current scandal — why not regulate these companies?Let's leave aside for a moment the government's spectacularly bad track record when it comes to regulations, which include most recently the financial crisis in the heavily regulated banking industry.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe first question to ask is why should a company like Facebook be regulated?Here's Tim Cook's answer: ""The ability of anyone to know what you've been browsing about for years, who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life — from my own point of view it shouldn't exist.""But what Cook leaves out is that every bit of information Facebook has on its users — just as every bit of information Apple has on its own customers — has been volunteered by them, after they've agreed to the company's privacy provisions.Nor does he mention that consumers often volunteer personal information in exchange for a benefit or service — such as grocery store discount cards.Or why companies like Facebook — and Apple, and Google (GOOGL) and others — are interested in such data. It's not to snoop, but to create more personalized experiences and better targeted ads.Nor has Cook, or anyone else for that matter, made the case that the private sector can't handle this issue faster and more efficiently than a few dozen bureaucrats in Washington grinding out thousands of new rules.Facebook users are free to cancel their accounts, or switch to other social media services, if they think Facebook's privacy protections are insufficient. That's exactly what many are doing right now in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, with #DeleteFacebook even trending on Twitter.And it's why Facebook is buying full-page ads in newspapers proclaiming that if Facebook can't protect your information ""it doesn't deserve it"" and promising to ""do better for you.""Cook also labors under the delusion that the government is capable of ""well-crafted regulation."" If such a thing exists, we'd like to see it.Mostly, the government regulations manage to either make things worse or require endless new rules to deal with the distortions the previous ones created.Regulations tend to impede progress, not accelerate it. And more often than not, they hurt the very consumers they are supposed to help by raising prices and blocking competition. If you don't think so, look at the Federal Communications Commission's long and terrible history of consumer harm, which IBD has detailed.But there's a bigger problem here with these calls for regulations. Particularly when they come from industry.While conventional wisdom has it that companies oppose regulations, the opposite is more often the case, at least when it comes to large companies.As we have noted in this space before, big businesses often lobby for regulations. Why? Because big companies can hire an army of lobbyists to make sure the rules are written to their advantage. And they can absorb the costs of complying with those regulations. The same is not true for smaller competitors.As a result, regulations end up protecting existing industry giants — like, say, Facebook — who want to thwart new competition.That's why the airline industry bitterly fought against deregulation in the late 1970s, why some auto companies urged federal fuel economy standards, why Philip Morris backed tobacco regulations, why Goldman Sachs supported the heavy-handed Dodd-Frank banking regulations (admitting that Goldman would ""be the among the biggest beneficiaries of reform""), why H&R Block supports federal regulation of tax preparers.It was self-interest, not consumer protection, that prompted Google, Facebook, Netflix (NFLX) and others to aggressively support the FCC's massively intrusive ""net neutrality"" regulations, and then fight against their repeal.Has Facebook abused its trust with its members? That seems obvious, and Facebook is paying for this mistake and will likely continue to do so. If Facebook has violated any laws, it deserves what it gets in court.Meanwhile, the message to other social media companies is loud and clear — violate consumer trust at your own peril.By the time regulators get around to crafting rules for social media companies, the problem will have already been dealt with.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Funny, When Obama Harvested Facebook Data On Millions Of Users To Win In 2012, Everyone CheeredUber And Lyft Are Hurting Mass Transit?

Meanwhile, Tesla (TSLA) stock is struggling with three technical challenges as Elon Musk faces an executive exodus and fresh manufacturing concerns.S&P 500 index futures fell a fraction vs. fair value.

They made their predictions exclusively available to Investor's Business Daily ahead of time.High on the list is bitcoin and blockchain. People are aware of the cryptocurrency trend but feel pretty mixed about it, said Gaffney, noting that ""Christmas, apparently, was very big for bitcoin awareness."" (There was certainly no shortage in December of guides on how to gift bitcoin.)IBD's TAKE: Watch our exclusive interview with Adobe's Tamara Gaffney, above, as she breaks down how she thinks blockchain and virtual reality will factor into the retail experience in 2018.And there's interest in using blockchain as a ledger system beyond cryptocurrencies. In a survey of IT and marketing leaders, ""less than 9% have actually started to implement blockchain, 10% are doing a proof of concept and 33% are in the process of thinking about how to get there, which is a really high amount"" for such a technology, said Wang.""Imagine you're in high-end luxury goods, and you want to trade your latest Gucci bag or trade the latest Rolex in the used market,"" said Wang. ""How do I know it's real? When we think about provenance and authenticity, that's where it's going to play a role.""He said he can see blockchain being used not just in retail and commerce but how people trade personal data with marketers, allowing customers to opt in and out of being contacted about their interested in alcohol or cars, for example.Gaffney also sees virtual reality continuing to be a hot topic this year, but not necessarily as an at-home entertainment device, calling out The Void's Disney (DIS) VR experience in Southern California, for example.""This could be the new replacement for all of that mall space that is empty,"" she said. ""(It) could be, in my opinion, VR entertainment/theme parks coming to a mall near you.""And when it comes to at-home entertainment viewing habits, over half of all respondents across age groups still subscribe to a cable or satellite service, which she expects will translate to stabilization in the media space.""As far as the death of television is concerned — there's still people out there using it,"" said Gaffney. Still, streaming services are booming, with customers often subscribed to more than one platform. Over 77% of respondents said they use Netflix (NFLX) at least once a month, and 75% said they use Alphabet's (GOOGL) YouTube at least once a month.

With Aramco's valuation estimated at $2 trillion, an IPO was seen yielding proceeds of $100 billion, dwarfing current No. 1 Alibaba's (BABA) $25 billion haul.But insiders close to the process told the Wall Street Journal that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who runs the day-to-day affairs of the kingdom, believes the legal risks of an international listing could be insurmountable.Rising oil prices have also lessened the need to peruse a lucrative listing at a major overseas exchange. When Prince Mohammed first floated the idea of an IPO in early 2016, oil prices had fallen below $30 a barrel, but Brent crude is now above $66 a barrel.Aramco told the Journal that an international listing is still possible, saying ""A range of international options are still being held under active review.""Among oil-related stocks, Exxon Mobil (XOM) fell 1.3% on the stock market today, and Chevron (CVX) also dropped 1.3%. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) dipped 0.7%. BP (BP) lost 1.9%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe crown prince is expected to meet with President Trump during his trip to the U.S. beginning Monday, but he is not expected to make any official announcements about the listing plans during the trip.The president will no doubt be hoping his much-vaunted deal-making ability can help change the prince's mind, for he could yet reject the advice of his advisors and push ahead with an international IPO next year. It had been the main component of the Vision 2030 economic transformation plan, which had planned to funnel the proceeds into the Saudi sovereign-wealth fund to help diversify the kingdom's economy.A listing on the Saudi exchange would allow Prince Mohammed to fulfill a pledge to publicly list the company, but without the same litigation and disclosure risks the company would be exposed to on larger exchanges such as New York, London or Hong Kong. Saudi officials have been playing up the case for listing on the domestic Tadawul exchange, insisting it would allow citizens to have a stake in the country's cash cow.It is unclear whether the Tadawul would be equipped to deal with a listing of such magnitude, with the market cap of all stocks on the exchange coming in short of $480 billion, which is less than even the most conservative valuation estimates of Aramco.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN: Saudi Aramco IPO Unlikely This Year As $2 Trillion Valuation In Doubt U.S. Crude Supplies, Output Climb As Exxon Mobil Aims To Double ProfitThe 'New Future' For Oil And Gas As Technology Innovations AccelerateWhat Makes The Price Of Oil Go Up And Down?

In 2017, Amgen's total sales declined 1%. In 2018, Amgen expects total sales to again decline by 2.4% at the midpoint of guidance.Among megamergers, Celgene is most interesting, Young said. Amgen would have to pay $98 billion at a 50-50 split in cash and equity including an addition debt raise of $18 billion. Over 2019-22, Celgene could add 6% and 11% to the top and bottom lines, respectively, on a compound basis.But ""the Celgene financing and Revlimid's controversial intellectual property matters make the deal complex,"" she said. AstraZeneca would also have some interesting revenue synergy, but ""there are significant integration risks"" as AstraZeneca's employee base is three times bigger.In the midcap range, Incyte (INCY) and Alexion are also interesting ""plus they allow for some flexibility to do a few small deals as well,"" Young said. Both would fit nicely with Amgen's hematology unit and require no equity financing.But Incyte is unlikely in the near-term. In the first half of 2018, Incyte and partner Merck (MRK), a Dow Jones component, are set to unveil the results of a trial of their immuno-oncology drugs epacadostat and Keytruda in advanced melanoma.Alexion just had positive data for its next-generation version of its biggest moneymaking drug, Soliris, called ALXN1210. Amgen could buy Alexion for $43 billion, adding 3% and 8% to sales and profit, respectively, Young said.She kept her neutral rating and 194 price target on Amgen.

""Therefore a big thank you to the Founders and to our Brand Ambassador whom we wish all the best in their future endeavors.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe statement also claimed the digital currency will now ""within its ecosystem and become a genuinely anonymous cryptocurrency,"" that will no longer be controlled by any individual.A separate statement on the site said ""we have reached the Soft Cap of $75M during our ICO, we would like to thank all the ICO participants for their support and contribution. We still have limited number of the tokens available; Registered users can add more tokens anytime from their dashboard.""The development comes after it emerged Friday the Seagal-backed ICO was not above the law, with a state regulator warning residents against investing in the knockoff cryptocurrency.The Tennessee Department of Commerce said the Bitcoiin venture is a dark territory, as none of the companies, promoters, or investments related to the curiously named currency are registered with its Securities Division.""Rushing into an investment that you don't fully understand can be bad for your bottom line,"" TDCI Assistant Commissioner Frank Borger-Gilligan said in a press release.

STMicro lost 0.7% Monday morning.An earlier entry could present itself if a proper handle forms, but one hasn't yet.

976,ADS,"AstraZeneca (AZN), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are the likeliest targets of a biopharma ""detonation event"" in which tax reform spurs widespread mergers and acquisitions across the group, an analyst said Friday.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez calls the coming consolidation ""inevitable.""Products made by the likes of AbbVie (ABBV), Roche (RHHBY), Amgen (AMGN), Dow Jones stock Merck (MRK), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Shire (SHPG) are soon to face new competition and generic rivals.This follows ""an unprecedented period of innovation and new product launches within large biopharma,"" he said in a note to clients. ""Several of the largest companies will likely experience a substantial growth slowdown within the next five to seven years.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseCelgene, Biogen and AstraZeneca would be most accretive to a potential acquirer, based on short-term financials, Fernandez said. Their average accretion in 2020 would be 25%, 14% and 13%, respectively.But Bristol, AstraZeneca and Vertex make the most sense long-term and strategically, he said. These three appear to be ""best positioned"" for longer-term revenue growth based on a look at consensus expectations for 2020-24.The last major consolidation period in biopharma occurred during the last decade, in which there were seven deals greater than $40 billion in value. The largest was Dow Jones stock Pfizer's (PFE) $93.8 billion acquisition of Warner-Lambert, at a 34% premium.Pfizer also paid the biggest premium, 38%, on Pharmacia, forking over $60.5 billion to acquire the firm. Merck paid a 34% premium to buy Schering-Plough for $45.7 billion. Since 2010, deals combining Pfizer with AstraZeneca and Allergan (AGN) and AbbVie with Shire have failed.Fernandez sees the next cycle as a seller's market. Pfizer is struggling with its late entry to the immuno-oncology market, whereas Merck has a strong immuno-oncology drug — Keytruda — but lacks a robust late-stage pipeline.Roche faces biosimilar competition for its top drugs: Avastin, Herceptin and Rituxan. Novartis (NVS) is still experiencing challenges in its Sandoz unit. AbbVie is strong in the near-term, but its key drug Humira will soon see competition in Europe and in the U.S. after 2022.Strategically, AstraZeneca would be a strong fit for AbbVie, Pfizer, Roche or Merck, Fernandez said. Bristol could fit in at AbbVie and Pfizer. Meanwhile, it's possible AbbVie could swing for Vertex.Through a financial lens, AstraZeneca, Vertex, Biogen and Bristol are the most compelling targets for their ability to enhance long-term sales, he said.Amgen could be an acquirer or a target with $70 billion in funds to buy something, Fernandez said. Assuming Amgen is looking to make a deal valued at less than $90 billion, Vertex rises to the top of the list among the potential targets, outlasting Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Shire.""Among the three, Vertex looks more interesting,"" he said.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityLong-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFsShould You Buy A Stock Ahead Of Its Earnings Report?

983,ADS,"Is the IBD 50 trade war-resistant? Judging by the current composition of the list, one could argue, ""Yes, reasonably so.""More than a week after President Trump signed off on a 25% tariff on steel imports from most countries and a 10% hike in aluminum on March 8, the major indexes have taken it in stride. Both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 are up since that day's close. The Nasdaq holds a nice cushion above its 50-day moving average.However, angst over the consequences of the protectionist trade strategy still hangs over the bull market. Will China and Europe retaliate? Which sectors could suffer the most if countries engage in tit-for-tat measures? Will the Scots and Brits really stop drinking Kentucky bourbon if prices skyrocket in the U.K.?No one knows. But in the IBD 50, very few of the companies making the list at the end of Thursday sell a commodity. Such physical goods appear to have a higher risk of getting punished by quotas or tariffs imposed by other countries. Warrior Met Coal (HCC) is the sole coal play in the list and sells in U.S., European, Latin American and Asian markets.In a November release on Q3 results, management expressed confidence it will remain a top exporter of high-quality metallurgical coal for the steel industry.""Strong sales volume coupled with high price realization and an exceptionally low cost structure enabled us to achieve strong free cash flow conversion,"" CEO Walt Scheller said in the release. The firm posted an average selling price of $144.06 per short ton; cash cost of sales rose $7.65, nearly 9%, vs. Q2 to $89.91.Warrior Met shares are trying to rebound off the 10-week moving average for the second time in as many months.The bulk of the IBD 50 firms are in finance, semiconductors and software.

The savvy IBD reader recognizes that entrepreneurs deliver innovative new products and services that span a wide swath of industries.Take Casa Systems (CASA). The Andover, Mass., company is the only one in the IBD 50 hailing from the telecom infrastructure industry group. Only six companies in the 26-member group trade at least 30 a share.

Volume is running mildly lower vs. the same time Friday on both main exchanges.The S&P SmallCap 600 was off slightly.In addition to Apple, at least three more of the 30 components of the Dow industrial average gained 1 point or more, including Walt Disney (DIS), Microsoft (MSFT) and Big Pharma play Merck (MRK).Microsoft has the best IBD RS Rating among the quartet of mega-cap stocks with an 86, meaning it's outperformed 86% of all publicly traded companies over the past 12 months. Apple is second best with an 83, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. Disney (RS Rating 38) is working on a new base and Merck has the weakest RS Rating at 13.The Nasdaq composite is close to wiping away the nearly 0.7% losses incurred over the prior two weeks.Solar energy and certain biotechs, particularly gene therapy plays, led the upside thanks to strong gains from names such as gene therapy play Bluebird Bio (BLUE) and China's Daqo New Energy (DQ), which has been highlighted in IBD's Stock Spotlight screen, while retail and defensive food stocks (think dairy, meat, food preparation) sank.Bluebird, which now has a $9.7 billion market cap, qualifies as a mid-cap company despite having only $33 million in revenue over the past four quarters.

Expect the CME Group to also launch Bitcoin-related futures this month.Liquidity is decent for the individual investor, as Bitcoin Investment Trust trades on average nearly 90,000 shares each day, equivalent to $161 million in dollar turnover. The ETF initially broke out of a very deep cup with handle at 985.10 on Nov. 22 in quiet trade initially.Volume really kicked in on Nov. 27, when shares rocketed more than 23%.At this point, the 10-day moving average acts as a useful chart tool in which one may sell the ETF if Bitcoin Investment drops sharply through it. As noted in a prior Stock Market Today column, the ETF's 50-day moving average is lagging too far behind and is thus not useful for determining a short-term exit point.Apple, meanwhile, is likely rising on anticipation for a strong holiday shopping quarter. New products from the tech giant are apparently seeing robust demand worldwide, ranging from the ultra luxury iPhone X to a new Apple Watch that can receive and send phone calls.Apple is now up nearly 7% past a 160.97 buy point in a second-stage cup with handle, and is thus extended.But notice how the stock is holding above its rising 50-day moving average, a good sign.The Accumulation/Distribution Rating is also positive at B-, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup.

Shares have risen more than 49% since then and are now forming another shallow flat base with an 86.30 entry.Notice on a weekly chart how Microsoft found buying support during a brief pullback last week to the 10-week moving average, a bullish sign.Revenue at Microsoft has grown 8%, 1%, 8%, 13% and 12% vs. year-ago levels, helping to fuel a rebound in earnings.

993,ADS,"When Fidelity Investments needed a new manager of $17.4 billion OTC Fund (FOCPX) in September, it didn't need to look far. The Boston-based mutual fund behemoth tapped its own Sonu Kalra. Kalra was the manager of Fidelity's market-beating $23.3 billion Blue Chip Growth (FBGRX).X With help from leading stocks like Alibaba Group (BABA), PayPal (PYPL) and Five Below (FIVE), Blue Chip Growth gained 34.93% this year through Nov. 30, outperforming 91% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Direct as well as the S&P 500's 20.49%.He was also the manager from early 2005 through mid-2009 of OTC. Now he remains helmsman of Blue Chip Growth and lead manager of OTC.Kalra is on track to guide both funds to IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner status. As of Dec. 1, both funds had outperformed in all four time periods — year-to-date and trailing 3-, 5- and 10 years — needed to join the elite club, if they maintain those outperformances through year end.In a talk with IBD from his office in Boston, 46-year-old Kalra discussed his investment strategy, his early mentors at Fidelity, why shareholders should not fear that he is stretched too thin by adding OTC to his workload, and more.IBD: You nearly doubled your assets under management by taking on OTC Fund. How do you know you can handle two funds that large?Kalra: I have gotten that question a few times. There are a couple of reasons why I'm not spread too thin. The biggest reason is that I have a co-manager on OTC, Christopher Lin. He was an integral part of the growth team here, a research analyst in the tech sector.List Of Mutual Fund Six Month LeadersBest Performing Mutual Fund CategoriesSome Mutual Funds Get A Boost From Value Stock TiltWhich Stocks Are The Top Fund Managers Buying?Bond Fund Decline In November: Turning Of The Tide?So he covered some of the larger growth stocks in the technology sector, companies like Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN). And those companies have been key contributors to strong performance by both OTC and Blue Chip Growth funds. For him to come on as co-manager makes it possible for us to manage and for me to not be stretched too thin.Another reason is that I ran OTC before, so I'm familiar with this product. And overall, 80% of the assets in OTC I owned in Blue Chip Growth.IBD: Are the funds run the same way?Kalra: There is a lot of overlap in the portfolios. But the nature of the funds differ (at the individual stock level). Their risk profiles are different. There are similar names but different weightings. They are both growth funds. But their mandates differ.Blue Chip Growth is more of a large-cap Steady Eddie growth fund, whereas OTC is more aggressive and has more smaller names as well as some younger, faster growing companies. Blue Chip Growth is benchmarked to the Russell 1000 Growth. OTC is benchmarked to the Nasdaq (Composite). That's why OTC has a larger tech component, given the Nasdaq's larger tech component.IBD: Summarize your overall investment approach for these two funds, Sonu.Kalra: I'm trying to find companies where the market is not only mispricing the absolute rate of growth but also the sustainability of that growth. We think of ourselves as long-term investors, trying to take advantage of the market's myopic short-term focus.IBD: Do you think of all growth stocks as the same?Kalra: I try to look at three buckets. One is the business model, how a company makes money. What's the company's potential to generate free cash flow? At the end of the day, the value of a company is all of its future cash flow discounted backward. Some companies get mispriced by some investors misunderstanding its potential to generate free cash flow in the future.Second, I pay attention to whether a company's incremental business opportunities are going to be better than they are today or are they deteriorating?Last, I focus on revenue growth. It's a number you can't make up. I'm really trying to find companies that can grow regardless of what's happening in the economy.IBD: As of your latest disclosure, tell me why you hold Alibaba in both funds.Kalra: I've owned it in Blue Chip Growth for some time. I introduced it to OTC in September when I took over. They are leaders in China of e-commerce, and e-commerce is growing there. About 15% to 20% of overall retail sales happen in China online. That's higher than in the U.S. because retail infrastructure is not as developed in China. So they don't have to compete with entrenched bricks-and-mortar competitors there.IBD'S TAKE: Alibaba has agreed to let Netflix (NFLX) globally distribute a popular detective drama series owned by Youku, which is owned by Alibaba.IBD: Why have you built your Blue Chip share count in PayPal?Kalra: The investment thesis is about the online growth of e-commerce. They provide the payment mechanism that makes it easy to purchase online. Their hidden gem is Venmo, a peer-to-peer payment mechanism. It lets people share payments with a social twist that's appealing to millennials. If they go out together for dinner with friends, they Venmo each other. It's almost become a verb. Eventually PayPal will begin to monetize it, but now they're piggybacking on the growth of online commerce. My guess is we're still a few years away before Venmo makes a material impact on the parent company from monetization.IBD: Five Below is another name you've been building. Is their secret sauce the fact that they sell products for $5 or less to a teen audience?Kalra: You hit the nail on the head. Brick-and-mortar stores have difficulties. What does work is when you have a great value proposition. That enables companies to drive traffic into stores. Having a price point of $5 says it all. They have iPhone cases, power cords, chargers. They are a beneficiary of the spinner (fad) inside schools.But there's more to their story. They have a fast supply chain. They can spot trends quickly and come to market fast and provide unbelievable value to consumers.They have a differentiated store model and also a store rollout that is growing their square footage more than 10% a year. So that shows healthy top- and bottom-line growth.IBD: Do you like the way Facebook is developing new platforms?Kalra: I started as a media analyst at Fidelity. One of the first things I learned was that advertising dollars follow eyeballs. Facebook has been a key contributor to and beneficiary of the change over the past five to 10 years in how people spend time across various media.Facebook is a core platform, but they also have Instagram and WhatsApp. Those have audiences spending more time on their applications, driving up ad dollars.IBD: OTC also has stocks that are not household names, like Atlassian (TEAM). What's your thesis?Kalra: They provide project management and collaboration software — software as a service. They went public in late 2015. Their software lets teams work on projects. They can seamlessly collaborate inside an organization. They're showing strong revenue growth, in excess of 30% a year for the past two years. They're in an underpenetrated market, and they are one of the leaders.IBD: What made you introduce Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) to OTC fairly recently?Kalra: They use technology to change the way surgery is done. Their system enables doctors to do surgery through robots. The outcomes are better. Fewer injuries. Safer. More cost-efficient for hospitals as well. It's a win-win for everyone, hospitals and patients.IBD: Which Fidelity managers have been your mentors?Kalra: I feel fortunate to be at an organization with a history of great investors and to be able to learn from them, watch how they work.Will Danoff (who runs giant $124.6 billion Fidelity Contra (FCNTX) and $28.1 billion Advisor New Insights (FNIAX)) and Steve Wymer (manager of $41.7 billion Fidelity Growth Company (FDGRX)) have been wonderful mentors. I've watched their work ethic, their ability to identify great growth companies early and stick with them for the long-term.I've worked closely with Steve Wymer. We've been on the same growth team here. We've traveled together, visiting companies, attending trade shows. Same with Danoff — we've been part of the same team.I was a tech analyst starting in 1998. For six years I was part of the research team focused on tech, so I supported guys like (Robert) Stansky (who ran Fidelity Growth Company and now-$16.9 billion Magellan Fund (FMAGX) from 1996 to 2005), Danoff and Wymer. So I've worked with some high profile managers here at Fidelity, identifying great companies.RELATED:Where To Find Income Without Taking Big Risks

998,ADS,"Clovis Oncology (CLVS) rose Wednesday to the detriment of Tesaro (TSRO) and AstraZeneca (AZN) after the Food and Drug Administration accepted its application for expanded use of its cancer drug, Rubraca.X In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Clovis rose 1.8%, near 58.70, as Tesaro dipped 2%, near 83.30, and AstraZeneca lost 0.5%, near 32. All three make drugs known as PARP inhibitors to treat ovarian cancer.Late Tuesday the FDA accepted a supplemental application from Clovis for Rubraca to be used as a second treatment or maintenance therapy for some ovarian cancer patients who are in complete or partial response to chemotherapy.With priority review, Rubraca could get approval to treat this population of patients in April.RBC analyst Kennen MacKay says it's possible the FDA could approve the drug earlier, as was the case for AstraZeneca and Tesaro. Tesaro's Zejula was approved for this group of patients three months early. AstraZeneca's Lynparza got approval a month early.It's possible Rubraca's launch in this indication could be underestimated, MacKay said in a note to clients. Zejula, Lynparza and Rubraca are all similar in terms of effectiveness, meaning differentiation will have to come from safety.Rubraca's label is cleaner than Zejula's, which warns of cardiovascular effects and bone marrow suppression, and Lynparza's, which warns of inflammation of lung tissue called pneumonitis.IBD'S TAKE: Clovis has an IBD Composite Rating of 28 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it underperforms more than two-thirds of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at better-rated biotechs.""If Rubraca's (second treatment) maintenance label remains similarly clean, we anticipate this could give sales representatives a marketing position and help commercial traction in the (second treatment) maintenance market,"" he said.Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt estimates the PARP inhibitor market in ovarian cancer at a peak $2 billion opportunity in the U.S. Clovis stock has been under pressure since its third-quarter report, which outlined competitive headwinds as a third treatment in ovarian cancer.""We think Clovis' Rubraca is very well positioned to capture market share in the large (second treatment) maintenance category pending approval in April,"" he said in a report.RELATED:Tesaro Takes A Swipe At AstraZeneca's Ovarian Cancer Drug SalesWhy Tesaro's $2 Million Cancer-Drug Miss Prompted Its Rivals To ToppleNektar, Acadia Pop On Street-Crushing Quarters, But Tesaro Dips

1000,ADS,"It's never fun to take a loss in a swing trade, but it's a lesson that is best to learn early. Taking a small loss in Alibaba protected your portfolio from a 10-point drop that followed over the next week and brings up a critical element of investing: make sure you live to fight another day.As an investor, you will make mistakes and you will have losing trades. It happens to the best traders. A key component of swing trading is keeping those losses small, especially in relation to your winners. Since we take profits quick, we need to take losses even quicker. Do that and you can make money even if half your trades are losses.Having sell rules is critical in this endeavor because you will often need to fight your emotions: The hope that a stock will come back, the fear that you will miss out on a big move, or the ego that doesn't want to admit defeat.Don't be concerned if the stock immediately goes up without you, it's going to happen. But you will also see numerous occasions where the quick sell will save you money or, just as important, time. A stock that goes sideways always carries the risk of another sell-off, plus the opportunity cost of not being in a better stock.That was the case with Alibaba (BABA), a recent trade on IBD's SwingTrader. The giant Chinese online retailer was already a leading stock, and we were looking to capture a short-term profit. Alibaba pulled back to its 50-day moving average and bounced, a clear sign of support. It then followed through on that bounce the following day (1). That set up the swing trade opportunity.Two days later, on Nov. 20, Alibaba cleared a previous area of resistance at 188 and joined SwingTrader (2). Volume was the highest level in more than 10 days (3) but the close was in the lower half of the trading range. Not an ideal finish, but not a deal breaker either.After a few days in profitable territory, Alibaba triggered a sell rule by closing decisively below its 5-day moving average line (4). We exited the stock before the close that day with a loss just over a half percent.The 10-day moving average could be used in some market environments, but this year we've gravitated toward the 5-day line. That's been a function of small shallow corrections followed by relatively small rallies in the market.It turned out to be a good sell since the stock lost another 7% over the course of the week. That kind of loss could wipe out a lot of progress in swing trading. IBD's Leaderboard, which also counted Alibaba as a member at the time, treated the stock differently but it's important to realize the distinction in strategy between the two products. Leaderboard put Alibaba on the Leaders list back in April at 111, so had a profit cushion of around 70%. That kind of cushion changes the math on how much room you can give a stock to correct.More details on Past Trades, like Alibaba, are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Cutting Losses Quickly Is Key To Long-Term Stock ProfitsHolding Alibaba Was Easy; Buying It Was TrickySwing Trading Strategies And Lessons

1002,ADS,"First Solar (FSLR) and other renewable-energy stocks took a beating Monday as the tax bill passed by the U.S. Senate early Saturday contained provisions that could harm wind and solar energy investment and deployment.X Several organizations supporting the renewable-energy sector sent a joint statement to members of the Senate, asking them to reconsider the Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax, or BEAT, provision, and also the corporate Alternative Minimum Tax.The BEAT provision aims to make it harder for businesses to avoid taxes. But it could also sweep up tax credits such as the renewable-energy Production Tax Credit for wind power, and the Investment Tax Credit for solar projects. That would make the credits more difficult to monetize.""If these provisions are retained, they will result in broad instability and uncertainty for businesses and investors across many sectors, including the clean energy sector,"" said the joint statement signed by six organizations, including the American Council on Renewable Energy, or ACORE.First Solar, which posted third-quarter results on Oct. 27 that crushed estimates, plunged 5% to 57.27. Among other solar industry stocks, Daqo New Energy (DQ) crashed by 17.4% to close at 47.04. Daqo is ranked No. 1 out of 19 companies in IBD's Energy/Solar industry group. Canadian Solar (CSIQ) plummeted 10.3% to close at 16.12. Jinko Solar (JKS) tumbled 7.5% to finish at 22.58.""The BEAT program, as currently drafted, would have a devastating impact on renewable-energy investment and deployment,"" said another letter signed by four renewable-energy groups, including the Solar Energy Industries Association.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.""If this bill passes as drafted, major financial institutions would no longer participate in tax equity financing, which is the principal mechanism for monetizing credits,"" wrote ACORE Chief Executive Gregory Wetstone in a prepared statement. ""Almost overnight, you would see a devastating reduction in wind and solar energy investment and development.""Credit Suisse, in a roundup on renewable energy issued Friday, also said the BEAT provision could undercut tax equity financing.""While the language and intention of the provision is geared more towards curtailing cross-border exemptions used to reduce tax bills, the renewable industry group is worried that it could make U.S. renewable tax credit monetization difficult for investors,"" the Credit Suisse report said.Many solar industry stocks have stumbled this year amid a 2-1/2-year washout.RELATED:Solar Stocks Shine As South Miami Passes Groundbreaking Law

1003,ADS,"Spirits have chipped away at beer's popularity for several years, but executives at Brown-Forman (BFB) see an even faster-growing kind of booze than spirits: straight-up hard liquor.X The owner of Jack Daniel's, Herradura tequila, Chambord and other kinds of liquor also ratcheted up its full-year profit and underlying net sales guidance and easily topped fiscal second-quarter forecasts on Wednesday. The results, as one analyst suggested during the company's earnings call, stood out as other companies in the consumer-staples industry struggle.CEO Paul Varga attributed that success, in part, to what the company has been doing for decades.""Our categories, where we're focused – American whiskeys, bourbons, increasingly tequilas, Irish – these are categories today that are growing ahead of even the distilled spirits category in the United States,"" he said during the company's earnings call. ""We think we're particularly well positioned.""The premium ends of those kinds of liquor, he said, tend to be the categories that are growing ahead of the market.Management also said that it was positioning its new Tennessee Rye for ""long-term success,"" and expected it to help sales for the rest of the year.That strategy could echo the way it has treated its Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and its cinnamon-flavored Tennessee Fire — both of which have been rolled out in recent years in attempt to draw millennial drinkers. Varga said ""it was a conscious choice to treat those more like brands,"" rather than novelty flavors.The company, in a statement, attributed the gains in the second quarter to ""improving economies in the emerging markets,"" and the appeal of Jack Daniel's, Woodford Reserve, Old Forester and Herradura tequila. Growth in Poland and Mexico was strong. Varga, during the call, singled out what he described as the rapidly-increasing popularity of Herradura Ultra in Mexico, where tequila isn't exactly in short supply.While the company suggested it was satisfied with its strategy to drive tequila sales, management said it might need to refine how it sells its single-malt scotch, which tends to be sold more uniquely, and at a higher price, than other kinds of liquor.The company said its Scotch brands aren't performing up to plans right now due to hiccups related to timing on bringing them to market.Shares were up 6.5% at 65.82 on the stock market today, a record close after surging as much as 9.6% intraday.IBD'S TAKE: On the search for even more stocks with actionable trading opportunities? Check out our Stock Lists page, where you can find stocks near buy zones, stocks hitting new highs, sector leaders, tech leaders, IPO leaders and more. Brown-Forman's fiscal Q2 earnings per share jumped 23% to 62 cents, while reported net sales rose 10% to $914 million. Wall Street expected EPS of 53 cents and revenue of $868 million, according to Zacks Investment Research.The company boosted its full-year EPS outlook to $1.90-$1.98, up from a prior view of $1.85-$1.95, with the midpoint above the consensus for $1.92. Brown-Forman now sees underlying net sales growth of 6%-7%, up from an earlier view for 4%-5%. The EPS forecast was helped by better sales, a slightly lower tax rate, and expectations for lower inventories.The company said it expects more modest growth in emerging markets for the rest of the fiscal year.Brown-Forman faces stiff competition from other big booze companies like Constellation Brands (STZ) — whose portfolio includes Corona, Kim Crawford wines and other spirits — and Diageo (DEO), whose brands include Smirnoff, Tanqueray and Captain Morgan. News surfaced earlier this year that Brown-Forman rejected a takeover offer from Constellation.But shares of Brown-Forman have climbed since late August, when the company raised its full-year EPS forecast and delivered estimate-topping first-quarter earnings, marking what Zacks analysts called a rebound from a ""dismal"" prior quarter.A lower tax rate and an easier foreign exchange environment influenced the full-year forecast at that time, but the company also held to its sales outlook despite troubled economies outside the U.S.Brown-Forman's results also arrive as the alcoholic beverage industry tries to figure out what to do with marijuana, around which a rapidly growing industry has formed as more U.S. states legalize the plant.Constellation in October said it agreed to take a 9.9% stake in the Canadian marijuana company Canopy Growth, while Molson Coors (TAP) said last month that the company had a team to gauge ""potential impacts and/or the opportunities"" of the cannabis industry.Brown-Forman last month said it was ""continuing to monitor"" the cannabis industry's development, without offering further detail. The subject did not come up during Wednesday's conference call.RELATED:Monster Beverage Tumbles Below Buy Point On Low-Energy EarningsAs Investors Eye Marijuana Industry, These Products May Go Mainstream

1005,ADS,"Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) recently set a record by becoming the first Chinese company to reach a market valuation above $500 billion.The Tencent milestone demonstrates how publicly traded, China-based companies have matured and risen to the international stage. China is experiencing rapid capital market growth and has set its sights on being an innovation leader. And it's become increasingly integrated within global markets, providing new opportunities for investors.Tencent, the 19-year-old leader in online gaming and messaging, on Nov. 20 had its share price climb to reach a market valuation of $522 billion — higher than the $519 billion valuation of Facebook (FB) on that day. Tencent shares have more than doubled in price this year.Until now, membership in the $500 billion club had belonged to U.S. tech giants: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook and Microsoft (MSFT).Another big winner among China-based stocks is e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA). Its blockbuster initial public offering three years ago surpassed Facebook as the largest technology IPO on a U.S. exchange. Alibaba raised $25 billion, vs. the $16 billion raised by the Facebook IPO in 2012.Alibaba and Tencent are not only big, but growing fast.In its latest quarterly results, Alibaba said revenue rose 61% to $8.3 billion as adjusted earnings climbed 63%. Tencent, in its latest quarter, said revenue rose 62% to $9.4 billion as adjusted earnings rose 42%. Both companies have consistently grown revenue and earnings at double-digit rates.""It's rare to see big companies growing at the rate of Alibaba and Tencent,"" said Brendan Ahern, chief investment officer at Krane Funds Advisors, which runs several China-focused exchange traded funds.Other high-profile China stocks growing at a fast rate include JD.com (JD), which competes mainly against Alibaba in the e-commerce market. JD came public in June 2014, with shares priced at 10 and currently trading near 42.Another is Baidu (BIDU), the largest search-engine company in China, with its shares up 43% this year.Whether Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, JD.com and many other fast-growing China companies can maintain their momentum, Ahern says indicators are pointing in the right direction.""China consumer confidence is at an all-time high and you have great earnings growth, so the trajectory is there and a strong case to be made that there is further upside available,"" Ahern said.IBD'S TAKE: Visit IBD's page on the Best Chinese Stocks To Buy And Watch to stay on top of the latest movers and shakers in China.The S&P China 500 Index, which contains 500 of the largest and most-liquid Chinese companies, is up 40% this year. The S&P New China Sectors Index, which includes Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu and JD.com, is up 59% this year. That compares with 20% for the U.S. S&P 500 index.The International Monetary Fund estimates that China's gross domestic product will rise 6.7% this year from the year-ago period, ""owing to the momentum from last year's policy support, strengthening external demand, and progress in domestic reform,"" the IMF said in a report published in August.But despite being the second largest equity market and the second largest economy in the world China remains an unknown quantity to many investors and is underrepresented in their portfolios, said a recent report from UBS. But that is gradually changing. As the capital markets of China become liberalized, it's expected that Chinese equities will become more prominent in the portfolios of global assets allocators, to reflect the importance and influence of its economy and financial markets.But the UBS report also cautioned that investors will need to take a more active approach to managing portfolios, as an economy in transition will create winners and losers.Since the 1980s, China has adopted a series of reforms to stimulate economic growth, including the privatization of government-controlled enterprises to foster competition. It also established equity and bond markets to finance the growth of the private sector and also support the government's spending. And it has enticed institutional investors into the market and cultivated mutual fund and ETF markets.And about one year ago China revised rules on foreign institutional investments in the country's domestic securities, to encourage more fund inflows. Three years ago regulators established China Connect, a cross-boundary investment channel giving foreign investors access to the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets through Hong Kong.In June, after four years of discussions, index provider MSCI announced it would include mainland Chinese equities, known as China A-shares, in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, which tracks $1.6 trillion worth of assets around the world, and related indexes. It's an acknowledgment of China's gradual market liberalization efforts.""The impact of the inclusion in the initial stage is expected to be modest, due to the limited inclusion factor,"" wrote Vania Pang, a capital markets and investments analyst at ICBC Credit Suisse Asset Management, after the MSCI announcement was made. ""Nevertheless, the decision shows that the China A market has gained recognition from international investors and cannot be neglected.""RELATED:Alibaba Pushes Deeper Into Retail With $2.88 Billion InvestmentJD.com Stock Jumps As Quarterly Earnings Beat EstimatesBaidu Tech Conference To Push AI, Video Streaming Amid Stock SlumpChina Web Firms Sina, Weibo, Autohome Top Third-Quarter Views

1009,ADS,"E-commerce leaders Amazon (AMZN) and Alibaba (BABA), along with social media giant Facebook (FB) and Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL) are the top picks of a Wall Street analyst who refers to them as giant redwoods that represent compelling investments.X Baird analyst Colin Sebastian rates the four internet stocks as his best picks for 2018, each with a rating of outperform.""In order of preference, our top large-cap picks are Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook and Alibaba,"" Sebastian wrote in a research note to clients Tuesday.""One of the most frequent questions we hear from investors is whether the mega-cap Internet platform companies, namely Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook, still represent compelling investment opportunities following several years of notable outperformance,"" Sebastian wrote. The answer, he said, is yes.""We like to compare them to the giant redwoods of the West Coast – trees that dominate over their forests, with the ability to withstand a variety of threats, and with strong foundations that provide significant lasting power,"" he wrote.In 2017, Amazon shares were up 56% from the year before. Facebook gained 53.4% and Alphabet was up 36%. Alibaba more than doubled in price.IBD'S TAKE: Collectively known as the FANG stocks, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet are among the tech titans of our time. Facebook and Google alone capture the lion's share of all global online advertising, Amazon dominates e-commerce while Netflix leads in media streaming.In addition to a strong engineering focus, massive scale and founder-control, Sebastian wrote, ""What we witness at Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook is continuous improvement and innovation that is difficult for many other public companies to match.""Shares of Amazon closed Tuesday at 1,189.01, up 1.7% on the stock market today.

1010,ADS,"Wynn Resorts (WYNN), Las Vegas Sands (LVS) and Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO) are sliding Tuesday after Macau gaming revenue for the month of December unexpectedly fell short of estimates.X Gross gaming revenue rose only 14.6% for the last month of 2017 to 22.7 billion patacas ($2.82 billion), according to Macau's Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau (DICJ), short of Bloomberg survey estimates for 20% growth.High-rollers who walked away from the table with winnings wound up weighing on December casino revenue in the Chinese territory, said the outlet.""We would attribute December's weakness primarily to the luck factor on VIP, although given the miss relative to consensus we would expect shares of the Macau names to be weak today,"" wrote Union Gaming analyst Grant Govertsen in a Monday report.Shares of Wynn were down 2.6% on the stock market today. Melco Resorts sold off 2.9%, Las Vegas Sands dipped 0.6% but had fallen as much as 1.4% earlier. MGM Resorts International (MGM), which is more U.S.-focused, rebounded from an intraday test at the 50-day line and edged up 0.4%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Gamblers nevertheless plunked down enough money to make it a double-digit year for Macau's casinos, with revenue up 19.1% in 2017 to 265.7 billion patacas ($33 billion). Reuters said analysts had expected 18%-20% in gains for the year.And that marks a big swing of fortune, compared to the last three years of year-over-year gaming revenue declines in the region amid a government crackdown on corruption. The last time Macau's gross gaming revenue ended a year in the black was 2013.""Looking ahead to early 2018, we expect the combined January/February period to grow in the high teens to low twenties (against a comp of +11% spread across the two-month period),"" said Govertsen, adding, ""For the whole of 2018 we are currently expecting growth in the mid-teens, driven by VIP at ~20%+ growth and mass at ~10%+.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Coal Vs.

1011,ADS,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) popped Tuesday after it and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) were listed as top biotech stock picks for 2018 amid ""hyper-competition, pricing pressure and uncertain (merger) activity"" likely to dominate the year.X Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges pegs Vertex and Alexion as leaders in 2018 as their rivals struggle with mounting competition and rely on pricing hikes to sustain top-line growth. Both have strong management teams and attractive franchises that could garner takeover interest.""Our analysis leads us to believe that the best performing stocks in the foreseeable future will be those participating in categories with high barriers to entry, that rely on volume growth rather than positive price contribution,"" he said in a note to clients.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Alexion climbed 3.7% to finish at 124.05. Vertex rose 2% to finish at 152.90. Vertex shares ended 2017 up 103% with Alexion down 2%. Meanwhile, the broader biotech group wrapped the year up 32%.Vertex was the second best performer of the top 10 biotechs by market cap, easily leading Amgen (AMGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Celgene (CELG) which ended the year up a respective 19%, flat and down 10%. Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) led the top 10, rocketing 239%.Vertex has monopolized the cystic fibrosis category with drugs known as Kalydeco and Orkambi, Porges said. Its nearest competitor, Galapagos (GLPG), is at a time disadvantage and its products haven't shown the same effectiveness as Vertex's.""Despite the lucrative commercial opportunity that cystic fibrosis presents, the high barriers to entry in this therapeutic indication have precluded the emergence of a clear, viable threat to Vertex's cystic fibrosis franchise,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: The median tenure of chief executives at large-cap biotechs fell to just one year in 2017, plunging from 11 years in 2007. That could have an impact on mergers and acquisitions in 2018, an analyst said last week. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look.In the first quarter, Vertex is likely to gain approval for a combination of drugs known as tezacaftor and ivacaftor to treat some cystic fibrosis patients. This should gain traction among patients who discontinued treatment with Orkambi due to tolerability.This year will also be key for Vertex's triple-pill regimen to treat cystic fibrosis, he said. Vertex is planning to begin pivotal trials in the first half of 2018. Most analysts expect a triple-pill to gain approval in 2019-'20.Alexion, meanwhile, has seen 20% revenue growth for a drug known as Soliris over the past two years as a treatment for a pair of blood disorders. This increase in sales was mostly due to volume increases with little price contribution, Porges said.In October, the Food and Drug Administration approved Soliris to treat a muscle disease, which should help continue the sales trend, he said. Alexion is also working on a follow-on drug known as ALXN1210 with a favorable dosing schedule and potentially better effectiveness.Porges expect ALXN1210 to prove superior to Soliris in treating a blood disease known as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria in Phase 3 testing. That should result in high conversion rates to ALXN1210 from Soliris when it's likely approved in 2019.""This catalyst should also extend the terminal cash flow horizon for Alexion's key franchise from mid-2020s to the mid-2030s, when patents for ALXN1210 expire,"" he said.Further, Alexion said late Tuesday its board of directors agreed to work with activist investor Elliott Management to identify a new board member. In November, Alexion said it had a search underway to fill an open board seat and is looking for candidates from a range of backgrounds, skills and expertise.RELATED:Q&A: Vertex Chief Talks About Company's 'Transformational Year'Why Biotech Stocks May Wait A While Before Feeling The LoveWhy This Biotech Could See 30% Upside In The Second Quarter

The stock is building the right side of a potential base.Elsewhere in the IBD 50, Nvidia (NVDA) looked to get back on track following Friday's 2% decline. The graphics-chip firm moved up 1.6%, as it once again approached its 50-day line where it found resistance last week.On the downside, gym operator Planet Fitness (PLNT) was downgraded from buy to hold at Jefferies, sparking a retreat of about 4%.

1013,ADS,"China stocks were getting whacked Wednesday, including e-commerce leader Alibaba (BABA), as investors looked at profit-taking and raised concerns over actions by Chinese regulators.X Alibaba shares fell 3.6% to close at 179.91 on the stock market today. Alibaba, which hit a record high of 191.22 on Nov. 2, received a price-target hike early this month.Also falling was Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), dropped 4% to 52. Tencent, China's leader in online gaming and messaging, hit a record high of 56.05 on Nov. 21.

JD.com reported third-quarter results on Nov. 13 that also beat estimates.Baidu (BIDU), China's search engine leader, gave back 3.5% to finish at 235.49. Baidu shares are down 10.5% since it reported third-quarter results on Oct. 26, with an outlook that fell short of estimates.Brendan Ahern, chief investment officer at Krane Funds Advisors, the investment manager for several China ETFs, said the decline in China stocks could likely be due to institutional investors taking gains before year's end.A report from Reuters said the drop in China stocks could be due to investors assessing the impact of sweeping new guidelines by China regulators to reduce risks in the country's asset management business. UBS Securities said in a report that the rules, which were designed to rein in shadow banking, could lessen investments in China stocks.IBD'S TAKE: The bull market won't go on forever, so read IBD's The Big Picture column to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.

1016,ADS,"The hype in what was one of the biggest IPOs of the year was huge. But so far, the returns are not.The lesson for savvy growth stock investors and short-term traders? Steer clear of the hype.XSnap (SNAP), which calls itself ""a camera company"" but essentially operates the highly popular social media network Snapchat, had a nice two-day pop after pricing an initial public offering of shares at 17 each. On March 2, shares finished their NYSE debut at 24.48, up 44% from its IPO, then rose to as high as 29.44 the next session.However, the ride has been nothing but a toboggan down in price. Wall Street has been sorely disappointed by slowing growth in active users and shocked by huge net losses. In the third quarter alone, Snap posted a net loss of 14 cents a share despite growing revenue 62% to $207.9 million.Snap's fourth quarter is not looking any rosier. The Street sees the company losing 16 cents a share in Q4, more than 15-cent loss in the year-ago period.New investors may want a piece of the action fast. After all, it's a brand-new force in the ever-evolving age of the internet, thus satisfying the N (""something New"") in IBD's seven-factor CAN SLIM investment paradigm, right?Yet no matter what is the next highly touted IPO, always take a watch-and-see approach. Refuse to buy a single share until a new stock produces a solid first-stage base. Let every new stock market debutante first establish some sort of price range in the open market, in front of millions of investors.Anything can happen. So it's sensible to let the marketplace sort things out.The first few weeks or months of action gives you a real vantage point. If the stock jumps above that price range, then you know that demand among fund managers is real and growing. A true buy point that offers higher reward and lower risk emerges. And ideally that price range should not be wide, such as 40% or 50% from low to high. Prefer those stocks that form a much shallower price range.If the stock drops to the lows of that initial price range, or even cuts below it, you also know that the readily available supply of shares is much greater than demand. This is exactly what happened with Snap on May 11. Pension funds, endowments, hedge funds and mutual funds are stepping away from the stock, not rushing to grab a stake.Decades of research by IBD has found that a few big winners can form a superb initial base that is much smaller in length than the typical winning chart patterns discussed in Investor's Corner and throughout the market and news coverage at Investors.com. While a cup base must be at least six weeks long, an IPO base can form in as little as four weeks or even less.Michael Kors (KORS), for instance, went public on Dec. 15, 2011, at 20 a share. Then the stock took just 13 days from Dec. 23, 2011, to Jan. 11, 2012, to form a very narrow IPO base that saw only a 7.5% decline from high (27.58) to low (25.50).The fashion accessories maker and store operator broke out on Jan. 17 with gusto, rising nearly 6% and swiftly jetting past the 27.68 IPO base buy point. It ran up to as high as 50.69 by March 9, 2012.However, not all IPO breakouts will work out that way. Indeed, a true growth stock investor cannot achieve excellence without executing great sell rules, no matter if a stock is on the way up or on the way down.If you seek investing greatness, learn this new sell rule that will help you get the most out of new IPOs. It's simply called the eight-week rule, showcased in IBD's newest home study program, ""IPO Trading Strategies.""This rule, the product of new IBD research, is simple to follow. You need charts to use it.Suppose the market is in a confirmed uptrend, and you buy a brand-new stock as it bursts out of its initial base. It rises. A string of up weeks tells you that institutional investors are rushing to grab shares. All good.Now it's time to apply the eight-week rule. Hold the stock until eight weeks have passed since the breakout day. Then study a weekly stock chart carefully.Has the stock risen at least 5% to 10%? Does it hold above the 10-week moving average? And is the market still healthy? If the stock passes these tests, continue to hold your shares or sell a portion. Then study the action on a week-to-week basis.Sell only when the stock sharply undercuts its 10-week moving average, typically in above-average volume. And don't ever let the stock's gain turn into a loss.In November 2006, New Oriental Education (EDU) blasted out of a seven-week initial base at 28.41. That price was 89% above the initial public offering at 15 a share. Its RS line shot to a new high. The Chinese school and test-center operator proved the paradoxical truth that a strong growth stock tends to get stronger.The IPO base was pristine. It had three down-weeks in price; just one week showed heavy volume (1), and it was, in fact, a support week. New Oriental bounced off its low, signaling a burst of buying by mutual funds, banks and the like.Eight weeks into the run, New Oriental finished the week at 33.54, up 18%. Ten weeks after the breakout, New Oriental was up 39% past the proper entry. It also reversed lower and closed below the 10-week line (2), but it wasn't a decisive break.You could have held on.A true break of the line came in the week ended July 27. New Oriental fell 14% that week; volume exploded 187% above average (3). It was a great time to sell. New Oriental went on to form another base, setting up a new breakout.You can add the IPO base as the eighth basic chart pattern that you must know — on top of the cup-with-handle, double-bottom, flat base, saucer, ascending base, the base-on-base, and the high, tight flag.The IPO Trading Strategies home study program (see the ""Home Study Programs"" product category at the IBD Store at Investors.com) includes two DVDs that integrate audio commentary from Mike Webster, a portfolio manager at IBD sister firm O'Neil Data Systems, with in-depth chart annotations.(Editor's Note: Portions of this column originally published in the Aug. 31, 2015, edition of IBD, and again on Feb. 23, 2017.)RELATED:The Next New IPO Gems: Can You Find The Next Google, Facebook, Cisco Or Microsoft?How Facebook Is Employing A Strategy From ""Art Of War"" To Battle The Threat From Snapchat Investor's Corner I: How To Find The Right Time To Buy A Good Growth StockInvestor's Corner II: Everything You Need To Know To Buy A Good IPOA Tale of 4 IPOs: Facebook, Alibaba, Snap And Square

Beijing has also pledged to phase out internal-combustion engines.Ford's revamped China strategy, he added, calls for eight all-new SUVs, at least 15 electrified vehicles from Ford and Lincoln, and an all-new range of affordable all-electric vehicles in partnership with its Anhui Zotye joint venture.The China strategy follows one from rival General Motors (GM) that was unveiled in September, calling for 10 ""new energy vehicles"" in China by 2020. And by 2025, it aims to electrify nearly all models of GM brands sold in China — Buick, Cadillac and Chevrolet.Ford has seen sales slump this year in the world's largest auto market. China sales slid 5% year over year  in the first 10 months of 2017 to about 939,000 units, despite strong results from certain nameplates including Jiangling trucks and Lincoln SUVs.

1019,ADS,"Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) will combine its generic and specialty drug units in an attempt to dig itself out of its ""grim"" situation, but one analyst doubted Tuesday whether the plan would work.X ""We have been here before with Teva, with new management coming in and trying to reshape the company, but running into challenges with the board in executing their plan,"" Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said in a note to clients.Still, circumstances are different, Divan said. The situation is ""grim,"" with Teva's debt level far above its market cap. Its credit status is now walking a tightrope between investment grade and junk. Divan has an underperform rating on Teva.Late Monday, Teva Chief Executive Kare Schultz unveiled the new plan, which will see Teva's generics and specialty units combined and focusing on the U.S., Europe and emerging markets. Some investors had wanted to see the businesses divided.Each of the regions will manage the entire portfolio of generics, specialty medicines and over-the-counter drugs, Teva said in a news release. A newly formed marketing and portfolio function will oversee interaction between the regions, research and development, and operations throughout all product life cycle stages.IBD'S TAKE: Generic drugmakers have struggled this year amid a growing number of approvals at the Food and Drug Administration, stoking competition. Teva has an IBD Composite Rating of 8 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it underperforms most stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Still, there are highly rated generic drug stocks like Ani Pharmaceuticals with a CR of 96. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a closer look.The shift will also see three high-ranking employees, including Chief Scientific Officer Michael Hayden, retire from Teva effective Dec. 31. Schultz also appointed six new executives, all from within Teva.Schultz said the full plan will be unveiled in mid-December. He expects a turnaround in the short- to medium-term. The new structure will enable Teva to use a leaner setup for finance, legal, human resources and global brand and communications.Teva's board has said it will work with Schultz to bring his plan to fruition, Divan said.""But until we see that commitment backed up by action, we maintain our current outlook,"" he said.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Teva ticked up 0.3% to close at 14.69.

1027,ADS,"If you are forced to sell a stock to cut losses, don't hold a grudge against it. It may give you a better opportunity months down the road.X That was the lesson IBD Leaderboard used when it added 58.com (WUBA) on July 10, as the Chinese internet stock broke out of a long base past a 47.48 buy point in a cup-shaped base. The fast-growing company made a solid advance from that entry and remains on Leaderboard to this day.For that to happen, Leaderboard editors remembered that a stock scorned is not one necessarily forgotten, and when conditions improve it's good to put aside bad memories.Three years earlier, 58.com had been a fruitless stock on Leaderboard. It was added June 27, 2014, as shares neared a possible buy point at 58.99. But the stock faded instead of bursting above the buy point. A few days later, on July 8, it was deleted from Leaderboard after 58.com plunged nearly 9% — its entry having never triggered. That spared subscribers from suffering losses on the stock.Months went by and the stock went sideways. April of 2015 saw the stock soar 44%, but the entire gain vanished two months later. China's largest online classified-ads platform continued to sag until it finally bottomed in February of this year.The first base from that long bottoming process formed in March, and on April 20 the stock broke out (1). At that point, 58.com had posted two straight quarters of losses as it struggled with its performance. But in May, the company posted a first-quarter profit of 10 cents a share, a sharp turnaround from a year-ago loss.58.com created another base from late May to a breakout past the 47.48 buy point (2). On July 10, once shares topped the entry, 58.com was welcomed back from exile as the company atoned for its financial slump. Chinese stocks in general were leading the market, another factor in 58.com's return to Leaderboard.IBD editors also noticed the drastic improvement in the earnings outlook. Today, the consensus analyst estimate for 2017 profit is $1.47 a share, vs. a 2016 loss of 26 cents a share. For 2018, analysts expect EPS of $2.36, which keeps the recovery going.The Chinese internet has found support at the 50-day moving average a couple of times (3), which has helped extend its stay on Leaderboard. Gains from the July addition to the list exceed 50%, even after a pullback this week.With Leaderboard, investors can get the needed guidance, as market specialists study the selected stocks and annotate charts with the latest signals.

1028,ADS,"The international economy is always alive with uncertainties, but the current picture seems extraordinary.X Grexit gave way to Brexit, Russia and OPEC are now allies in the fight against the global oil glut, the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Central Bank of England are hiking interest rates, with Europe's Central Bank poised to follow suit, and the U.S. is set to renegotiate a broad swathe of its cross-border trade pacts.Does all the flux and uncertainty mean U.S. income investors should retreat onto more familiar and fast-growing U.S. turf?""Absolutely not,"" said Richard Kahler, president of Kahler Financial Group in Rapid City, S.D., via email. ""Research indicates it's a fool's game to try and pick winners and losers in equity trends, interest rate trends and even in countries.""Kahler, whose firm manages $130 million in assets, acknowledges the U.S. has enjoyed a great run recently, but says ""it's no guarantee that will continue.""Where To Find Income Without Taking Big RisksTop Dividend Fund Manager Expects Growth In These Three SectorsDoes Steady Earnings Growth Lead To Big Dividends?How Growth Stocks Can Yield Solid Income TooWhat Does Trump Tax Cut Mean For Dividends?Knowing what's going on in the stomarket helps in decIt is also true that the more familiar territory of U.S. bonds and dividend-paying stocks won't generate the kind of returns sought by most income investors — at least not until the Fed cranks rates back up closer to their long-term norms.""For many clients that we deal with, navigating a lower interest rate environment means looking at strategies that diversify the source of your income,"" said Chris Wolfe, chief investment officer with First Republic Private Wealth Management in San Francisco.That means deciding on a mix of higher-risk and safe-bet bonds, like Treasuries, combined with a portfolio of dividend-paying stocks. It could include some real estate, as well as options strategies, where applicable.Each of these segments typically benefits from overseas exposure.""If you look at the fundamentals … when you compare them and put them next to each other, we do like international components much better,"" said Ekta Patel, director with Altfest Personal Wealth Management in New York.Patel, whose firm manages $1.3 billion in assets with an average portfolio of $2.2 million, says overseas economies — particularly developing economies — are playing catch-up to the long, gradual recovery cycle that has played out across the U.S. economy.Europe's recovery continues to show promise, Patel says. And the ECB's purchase of corporate debt, although set to taper, continues to bode well for eurozone-based dividend names, she said. Altfest maintains a core, strategic investment in emerging market debt, and makes tactical trades around that core position based on shorter-term events.IBD's TAKE: Keeping up with stock market news helps in deciding how to allocate assets globally. Keep up on market events with IBD's Big Picture & Market Pulse.Wolfe, part of a First Republic wealth management team overseeing $101 billion in assets, says it is critical to understand how the risks within a portfolio relate to each other. Risks from U.S.-based and non-U.S. equities in general are strongly linked. But risks between say, stocks in the U.K., where stock index dividends have yielded 3% to 4% over the past 12 months, and U.S. real estate have weak correlation, he says.""Even though diversifying might leave you short of your goal, you still want to diversify the sources of income in order to manage the risk,"" Wolfe said.Stock funds tapping U.K. and European companies include First Trust STOXX European Select Dividend Index Fund (FDD), which currently yields 3.1% and has its heaviest weightings in EasyJet, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and electrical utility Fortum. WisdomTree Europe SmallCap Dividend Fund (DFE) pays out 2.8%, with small caps in the U.K., Sweden, Italy and Germany accounting for about 60% of its portfolio.Kahler reiterates that attempting to pick the winners among countries is a gamble.  He suggests building a cap-weighted portfolio in equities, with a reasonable amount of international exposure in bonds and real estate.  ""Our target is one-third international and two-thirds U.S.,"" he said.Not all the best international plays are overseas. IShares International Preferred Stock (IPFF) yields 3.8% by investing nearly 80% of its portfolio in Canadian companies.Patel says China, India and Southeast Asia, as well as some South American countries, have improved their balance sheets and better balanced their foreign exchange reserves, altering the outlook for their markets.""That's where the growth is going to come from for at least the next couple of years,"" she said.Wolfe says understanding the landscape is key, and a good reason to turn to funds or advisors who are experts in particular regions. In Brazil, the 10-year government bond potentially yields about 4.8% right now. A 10-year bond in Argentina yields around 5.8%.Those with even higher risk tolerance might look to Argentinian or Brazilian corporations. ""That's really where you start to see a lot higher yields, because there is a lot of risk there,"" he said.The Fed's rate increases will ultimately improve the situation for U.S. income investors, Wolfe says. And while judicious use of overseas holdings can narrow the gap between the U.S. Treasury return and the total income return goal set by investors, he says, ""it is also important to think about whether or not there are strong (U.S.-based) multinational corporations that may also be added to your income.""RELATED:Dow Stock Merck Announced $10 Billion Buyback, Increases Dividend This Top Dividend Name Shapes A Base, But Is It Too Optimistic?Can This Big Dividend Stocks Have A Joyous Holiday Season And 2018?

1033,ADS,"No. 1 biotech Amgen (AMGN) could have an edge in the preventative migraine space where it competes against Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR), an analyst said Thursday.X Late Wednesday, the New England Journal of Medicine published safety data for drugs known as anti-CGRPs from Amgen and Teva. These drugs aim to inhibit a neuropeptide that has long been associated with migraine pain. Shares of Amgen closed 2% higher Thursday to 175.66.RBC analyst Kennen MacKay expects Amgen to take 20% of the U.S. anti-CGRP migraine market which he values at a total $5 billion opportunity. Amgen's drug, known as erenumab, has a cleaner safety profile differentiating it.""Efficacy data in the publications was previously known, though new safety data from Amgen's episodic and Teva's chronic migraine trials suggested safety could become a more differentiating factor as additional data is fully presented,"" he said.Liver toxicity remained clean in Amgen's trial with partner Novartis (NVS). Teva's drug, dubbed fremanezumab, resulted in slight liver test imbalances which could be explained by other medicines taken by patients.Amgen saw injection site reactions in 0%-3% of patients. Teva reported reactions in 20%-30% of patients who received either the drug or a placebo. This could be due to Teva's requirement for multiple injections, higher injection volume and/or needle size.Between the four, Amgen will have first-mover advantage with a potential approval date in May. Teva is using a priority review voucher for a potential approval date in June. Lilly is expected to enter the market in the second half of 2018 with Alder following.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech behemoths struggled during the third quarter, leaving room for small-caps to swipe headlines with their Street-crushing metrics. Head to the Industry Snapshot for a breakdown on how the third quarter played out in the group.Payors could block reimbursement for some patients beginning and continuing anti-CGRP therapy, MacKay said. Though he notes Amgen has extensive experience in negotiating with payors, ""making them highly competitive with this dynamic.""Drugs known as triptans are considered reasonable first-treatment options for acute migraines. Still, past payor policies favored sumatriptan, the first agent in the class to go generic, despite the existence of more effective, but costly, branded drugs.""These pricier though more efficacious agents were relegated to patients who were contraindicated for, or had recently failed sumatriptan,"" MacKay said. ""Payors could require continued proof of benefit for continued reimbursement (of anti-CGRPs).""MacKay models 30 million patients in the U.S. suffer from migraines including 2.3 million with chronic migraines and 2.4 million with episodic migraines and five to 14 headaches per month.""Of these, we estimate 35% (2 million patients) are seen by specialists and could classify for CGRP therapy,"" he said. ""Ultimately, we view the CGRP class penetrating into 25% (500,000 patients) of this U.S. market.""RELATED:Why The Medicines Co.

1034,ADS,"OPEC and Russia agreed Thursday to extend their current production cuts to the end of 2018 but are making assumptions on two X-factors that could undermine their strategy.X At OPEC's biannual meeting in Vienna, the oil producers agreed to prolong the current agreement to remove 1.8 million barrels of oil per day from the market as well as include OPEC members Libya and Nigeria for the first time. The deal also includes a provision to review the cuts at the June 2018 meeting.The two countries had been excluded from the prior cuts as their respective oil industries were recovering from internal strife that weighed on production.This time around, Libya and Nigeria have agreed to keep 2018 production at 2017 levels. Their previous output gains had helped add to the global supply glut that OPEC and Russia were trying to counteract.Their adherence to the limits will be key to the deal's success, and Saudi Energy Minster Khalid Al-Falih, who also presided over the OPEC meeting, was confident they would stick to their quotas.""To the market, we say there are no surprises to be expected,"" he said.U.S. shale has been the big threat to OPEC and top nonmembers as they try to balance oil markets, with gains in innovation and efficiency continuously unlocking new sources of crude.Shale companies have signaled recently that they are shifting their focus to cash-flow discipline rather than increasing spending to chase rising oil prices.Still, total U.S. oil production has hit record levels, and even set fresh highs for four straight weeks, as crude prices have rebounded this year. Rigs in operation also are trending higher again.But those gains aren't worrying OPEC, with Al-Falih saying ""the contribution of shale is going to be very much manageable"" next year.""My expectation is that 2018 will not be significantly different than 2017,"" he said.

1037,ADS,"OPEC and top nonmembers are widely expected to extend their current output-cut deal at a biannual meeting Thursday, but there are still a few wild cards left as the current deal is set to expire in March.X Hopes are running high, so any failure to prolong the agreement to remove 1.8 million barrels of oil per day from the market could send oil prices tumbling.""I think they learned their lesson to not disappoint the market,"" said Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group.While there is broad agreement on the need for an extension, the are other factors to consider. Here are five things to watch.Russia is ready to announce an extension on Thursday, but officials want the size of the cuts tied to the strength of the oil market, Bloomberg reported.While the general consensus seems that the current deal will be extended, Venezuela, which has been rocked by soaring inflation, has pushed for even deeper cuts.""If prices were weaker they would talk about deeper cuts,"" Flynn said. ""But I don't think they are going to need to talk about deeper cuts at this point.""Brent and U.S. crude prices have surged roughly 40% since June and are now hovering around $63 and $57 a barrel, respectively.In October, Venezuela said it was inviting 10 to 12 countries in South America and Africa to join the deal but didn't give details. And Uzbekistan could attend the meeting as an observer, Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said earlier this month.Compliance will also likely be a major topic.Last month, the International Energy Agency said compliance was at 86%, higher than in the past. But the unstable Kurdish region of Iraq is one of the least compliant regions. Iraq is the second largest OPEC oil producer.""But if you look at Iran, Iraq, Nigeria and Libya, even though their production has gone up, it hasn't gone up nearly as much as some people thought it would,"" Flynn said.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.The ""linchpin"" for production deal is Russia's relationship with Saudi Arabia, said Omar Al-Ubaydli, an affiliated senior research fellow at George Mason University, adding that the Kremlin has sought to forge better ties with Riyadh.Saudi Arabia also relies on high oil prices to fund its government and needs stronger, stable oil prices to get a strong initial public offering for state-run oil giant Saudi Aramco next year.""However both Russia and Saudi Arabia have an unpredictable policy in the Middle East at present so the accord is fragile,"" Al-Ubaydli warned.Russia and Saudi Arabia have supported opposite sides of proxy wars in Syria and Yemen, while tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia are growing. Elsewhere, tensions between Qatar, which restored full diplomatic relations with Iran earlier this year, and Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Cooperation Council countries are at a peak. Sources told Reuters there has been no official contact between the GCC and Qatar.""As bad as things are between Iran and Saudi Arabia right now, they have an amazing way of separating their oil politics from normal day to day politics,"" Flynn noted. ""When it comes to oil production they have a common goal of getting prices higher.""Three years after OPEC sparked a price crash to force surging shale producers out of the market, U.S. oil output has recently set record highs, keeping the resilient U.S. energy sector high on OPEC's agenda.Andy Hall, an oil trader who closed his hedge fund earlier this year, will speak to the cartel about U.S. shale, according to Bloomberg.

1048,ADS,"The U.S. holds an enviable lead in pushing artificial-intelligence technology out of labs and into real-world applications. Thank companies like Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB) and Apple (AAPL) for that.X But China's government and technology elites aim to overtake the U.S. in AI by 2030 — or so they proclaimed in July at a Beijing political gathering.Good luck with that.Yes, China has many strengths as it sets out for worldwide dominance in AI technology. Its internet giants Baidu (BIDU), Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA) and Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) are also pouring money into AI research and hiring top scientists.China's huge population will generate massive raw data to train AI systems in how to make predictions.  So there's good reason to think China will make breakthroughs in developing computer algorithms — the software programs that aim to replicate the human ability to learn, reason and make decisions.China also has a major weakness: a semiconductor industry that still lags the U.S. in making high-end electronic processors. Chinese companies buy AI chips mainly from Nvidia (NVDA), based in Santa Clara, Calif. Intel (INTC), the dominant supplier of brainy chips for personal computers, is pushing fast into AI.""Most AI-focused chips are developed by U.S. companies, and it will be a long slog for China to catch up,"" said David Kanter, head of chip industry consultant Real World Insights.UBS forecasts that the AI chip market will boom to $35 billion by 2021, up from roughly $6 billion in 2016. But AI stakes are higher than mere chip sales.AI technology is expected to transform economies. Artificial intelligence has been called a ""winner take all"" technology, meaning that companies and countries that gain an edge will build upon that lead over time.Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that whichever country leads in AI  will dominate global affairs.""Artificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia, but for all humankind,"" said Putin.

The race is on to build AI chips for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, smartphones, drones and other devices.""The war for AI architecture leadership is the biggest battle of our lifetime,"" said Gary Dickerson, CEO of chip equipment maker Applied Materials (AMAT), in an interview. He says new, specialized processors for AI software are coming. Applied Materials sells to both U.S. and Chinese chipmakers.Right now, the U.S. is ahead in startup AI companies and commercial deployment. U.S. Fortune 500 companies are pushing AI analytical tools into finance, health care, energy, agriculture, cybersecurity and elsewhere.Tech giants Apple, Google-parent Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft have forged ahead in applying AI software to speech recognition, internet search, and classifying images. Amazon.com's (AMZN) AI prowess spans cloud-computing services and voice-activated home digital assistants.China does plan to catch up. Just not right away.""They are in it for the long run,"" said Chirag Dekate, a high-performance-computing analyst at research firm Gartner. ""The U.S. is driving AI innovation across the spectrum, in software and hardware. Early-use cases, early adopters — it's happening more in the U.S. than any geography in the world. But China is looking at it from a marathon perspective.""China's government in July unveiled a three-step development plan to steadily build up AI capabilities through 2020 and 2025 and to lead the world by 2030.Building up AI engineering talent is key to the plan. Chinese scholars already are churning out AI research papers at a faster pace. Patents have soared in robotics and other areas. Chinese internet companies have set up AI research in Silicon Valley. Meanwhile, Baidu and other companies are paying top salaries to snatch AI scientists.And yes, high on the Chinese government's to-do list by 2030 is developing high-end AI chips.""Computing power is part of the basic infrastructure underlying AI and of significant strategic importance,"" said a report on China by Vertex Holdings in July.""Stronger control over the supply of core technologies can potentially improve China's future ability to deploy AI systems more widely,"" the report added. Vertex is part of Temasek Holdings, the Singapore state investment firm.Just a few years ago, AI research projects required hundreds of computers networked together to process complex software. One key to AI's spread in the global economy, says a CBI Insights report, is a new wave of AI chips.Nvidia has emerged as the early leader in AI chips. Nvidia's edge is that its PC gaming processors can be scaled up to handle AI software, thanks to their ""parallel processing"" circuitry that can handle complex multiple tasks.Baidu has been Nvidia's partner in self-driving cars. In September, Nvidia said e-commerce giant Alibaba Group, Tencent and others will use its AI chips in cloud-computing data centers.Intel has made several AI-related acquisitions. Intel says it's ​working with Facebook to develop an AI chip for cloud-computing services.In the U.S., it's not just traditional semiconductor firms that are developing AI chips. Google's strategy is melding AI software and chip technology. Google's TensorFlow data-center software runs on its own ""TPU"" chips.Apple's new iPhone X features its own machine-learning optimized A11 bionic chip. The AI chip supports facial recognition as a way to unlock phone screens. The ""bionic"" processor is just the start of Apple's push into AI chips, analysts say.The U.S. government, meanwhile, has been vigilant in protecting high-end chip technology.The Trump administration in September blocked the sale of Lattice Semiconductor (LSCC) to a Chinese-backed investor on national-security concerns. Lattice owns programmable software technology that offers an alternative way of building AI chips.The Obama administration in 2015 barred Intel, Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) from selling high-end supercomputer chips to the Chinese government over concerns they'd be channeled to military systems.China's scientists responded a year later by unveiling Sunway TaihuLight, which broke records as the world's fastest supercomputer and contained no U.S. intellectual property. Some observers view Sunway's accomplishment as a sign China could be competitive in AI chips.China is still a far way, though, from producing AI chips for the mass market. One startup, Cambricon, has attracted funding from Alibaba, Lenovo Capital and IT firm iFlytek. Singapore's Vertex is among the backers of another startup, Horizon Robotics.Huawei, one of China's top tech companies, also has AI chip projects underway.While China plans a big push into AI, it also plans to up spending on its semiconductor industry. China has put $20 billion into a new chip industry project and could spend as much as $150 billion, according to a U.S. government estimate.China still buys most high-end chips from foreign suppliers, even though it has twisted the arms of U.S. and European companies since the 1990s to share technology through joint ventures. Intel, Advanced Micro Devices and SoftBank-owned ARM dominate in microprocessor technology, where China has little intellectual property.""The progress of building an indigenous semiconductor industry has been slow in China,"" noted a Goldman Sachs report on artificial intelligence released in September. ""We expect lower foreign dependency over time.""Google reportedly has been trying to interest China's tech companies in its TensorFlow AI software tools, which make it easier to develop apps. But it's not clear if those talks have involved its AI chips as well. Google's cloud-computing service rents access to its TPU chips optimized for TensorFlow.Venture-capital investment in AI chip startups is soaring, says CBI Insights. While Nvidia's GPU chips have grabbed an early lead, startup AI companies are focused on developing chips designed from scratch to crunch artificial-intelligence software.

1058,ADS,"Snap (SNAP) unveiled a sweeping redesign of its mobile photo-sharing application on Wednesday, hoping to lure more users and advertisers to revive revenue.X After three quarters of disappointing sales since going public earlier this year, the company said a simpler design will encourage people to spend more time using Snapchat, increasing the app's appeal to advertisers over the long term.The main change: separating photos and videos sent to users by their friends from content produced by media companies. Snap touted the move as a philosophical departure from rival Facebook (FB).""Until now, social media has always mixed photos and videos from your friends with content from publishers and creators,"" Snap said in a blog post. ""While blurring the lines between professional content creators and your friends has been an interesting internet experiment, it has also produced some strange side effects (like fake news) and made us feel like we have to perform for our friends rather than just express ourselves.""Snap shares ended trading Wednesday up 0.7% to 13.70. Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel touted the redesign in the company's earnings call earlier this month, providing hope that the company was on the path to fixing its issues, but warning the changes could disrupt growth in the short term.Spiegel has taken pains since going public to present his strategy as unique and not directly comparable to Facebook, which has seven times as many users and has copied some of Snapchat's most popular features.Meanwhile, advertisers and investors are using the social media giant as a benchmark for the much smaller company's potential. Los Angeles-based Snap's shares had dropped 20% since its March initial public offering. Amid a broad tech sell-off, shares were down 1.4% to 13.42 in midday trades Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: With a Composite Rating of 14 out of a best-possible 99, Snap shares have struggled since the company's IPO on March 2 and appear now to be consolidating. Snap is ranked 28th in IBD's Internet-Content group; Facebook is ranked No. 1 and has a 99 Composite Rating. Snapchat's new design borrows one important ingredient from Facebook's strategy: algorithmic organization of content.The redesigned Snapchat app still opens first to a camera. Swipe right, and users can see photos and video messages from their friends, as well as daily public stories friends share, in the same place. Swipe left, and all the content from Snap media partners, such as television networks NBC and ESPN, is mixed with curated event videos and ""snaps"" from internet celebrities.Snap said it will organize the content based on user behavior. Instead of listing friends in the order of whom a person talked to most recently, like in messaging apps, it will organize them based on how important they are to that person. Snap will draw on similar behavior cues for the media feed.The redesigned app will be available to a small percentage of users right away and roll out to everyone ""in the coming weeks,"" Snap said.The application's past designs listed friend stories in the same feed alongside content from media partners, but the company kept changing how prominently it displayed those made-for-Snapchat mobile magazines — where it makes much of its revenue from advertising.Having the news content in a personalized feed may make it more approachable, Snap said. Or it could be ignored, if people choose to only use the app to talk to friends.Organizing the content with the use of algorithms also creates the potential for feed ads, a type of advertising familiar to marketers from Facebook and Twitter (TWTR). The main difference with Snapchat is that its 178 million average daily users won't be served content based on what their friends like and share. Snapchat posts can't go viral within the app like those on Facebook. People will see what they like as individuals, not what's popular.""Separating social from media has allowed us to build the best way to communicate with friends and the best way to watch great content — while addressing many of the problems that plague the internet today,"" Snap said in its blog post.

1060,ADS,"MainStay Large Cap Growth Fund (MLAAX) is racing at a gallop, thanks in part to thoroughbred holdings like Alibaba Group (BABA), Nvidia (NVDA), PayPal (PYPL) and Facebook (FB).XThe first two have gained more than 100% this year. PayPal is up nearly 100%, and Facebook has climbed nearly 60%.Fund lead manager Justin Kelly describes where the $12.4 billion fund's giddy-up has come from in broad terms: ""During what we called the QE (quantitative easing) bubble from 2012 to 2016, growth stocks were (largely) out of favor,"" he said. ""Value and safety stocks were (generally) in favor because interest rates were so close to zero."" Now investors' appetite for growth has returned. ""People feel better about the growth outlook and (generally) are willing to pay more for growth stocks,"" he said.That appetite has enabled the fund to jump 32.05% so far this year going into Friday. That's well ahead of the S&P 500's 18.11% gain and the fund's large-cap growth peers' average of 25.74%. It's also nearly triple the fund's own three-year average annual gain and more than double its five-year pace.The fund itself shows a preference for three flavors, or buckets, of growth. One bucket holds consistent growers. ""Those are companies that tend to grow through positive as well as more-challenged economic times,"" Kelly said.The second bucket holds what Kelly calls dynamic growth companies that he and his colleagues estimate will grow revenue and earnings an average of 10% or more for each of the next three or so years. ""They've been growing market share in markets that are expanding,"" Kelly said, and their industries tend to be newer.The third bucket holds cyclical growth stocks operating in more economically sensitive sectors. ""We believe those companies are in the right part of their cycle,"" Kelly said about bucket No. 3.In any bucket, a holding must be addressing a growth opportunity, gaining market share or have a leading share, and have high or rising return on invested capital. It also must have sustainable competitive advantages and strong, innovative management.Managed care provider UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is an example of a stock in that first bucket. Steven Hamill, who tracks health care stocks for the fund, says the fund team believes UnitedHealth benefits from membership growth, driven by rising employment and by increased use of managed care by the U.S. government to control costs. The firm also benefits from its use of data analytics.That's a payoff from UnitedHealth's acquisitions of information-technology companies over the past 15 years, Hamill says. With more insight into patient trends and cost trends, UnitedHealth has been able to offer services at prices below those of its rivals. ""That's allowed them to gain share and have profit-margin growth,"" Hamill said.Salesforce.com (CRM) — whose cloud software helps businesses organize and handle sales operations and customer relationships — is an example of a stock in bucket No. 2 for dynamic growers. On Tuesday the company reported adjusted third-quarter profit and revenue that topped expectations, but its profit outlook for the current quarter slightly disappointed most investors, IBD reported.""Our belief is that they can grow free cash flow at (an average of) 25% annually for the next three years, and that the market is underestimating the duration of their growth,"" Kelly said.Netherlands-based ASML Holding (ASML) is an example of a company in the fund's third bucket, holding cyclical growers. ASML makes lithography systems used to fabricate integrated circuits. The fund began its current stake in June.""We saw a big upward earnings cycle developing,"" Kelly said. ""We believe the company (looked poised to) make more money in the next two years than Wall Street's consensus view expected. So our analysis differed on both the size and duration of their expected free cash flow and earnings.""MainStay Large Cap Growth's big gainers this year include Alibaba, which is in the dynamic-growth bucket. ""They are the leading e-commerce platform in China, and they have an emerging (online) payments platform (Alipay) and cloud services business,"" Kelly noted. ""They've benefited from many growing technology trends. They are the Amazon (AMZN) of China.""Alibaba is a longtime member of Leaderboard — IBD's premium service that spotlights play-by-play moves of top stocks.Nvidia, another dynamic growth stock in the fund's portfolio, has expanded well beyond its roots in video games. ""We think their video game business is a modest grower,"" Kelly said. ""We believe their gem is their data-center products business. We think their business in (chips for) self-driving cars is only beginning.""Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) enable players to see increasingly lifelike action in video games. Now variations on those GPUs provide the speedier calculations needed by data centers, machine learning and self-driving cars. ""We believe those newer businesses have faster growth than their video games business,"" Kelly said.PayPal, also a dynamic growth stock, benefits from the shift to electronic payments. ""As transactions increasingly go online, we believe PayPal makes it easier for consumers to make purchases quickly,"" Kelly said. ""We think their growth will be stronger than the market (in general) believes.""Facebook is also a member of IBD's Leaderboard. The increasing use of social media is driving Facebook, Kelly says. ""As they've gotten bigger, they've applied more analytics to their technology, increasing returns for advertisers,"" Kelly said. ""We believe it's a self-reinforcing advantage over other social media services like Twitter (TWTR) and Snapchat (SNAP).""RELATED:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

Vertex already has four potential triple-pill combos in midstage testing, whereas Galapagos just has one potential piece of its triple.Late Sunday, Galapagos said its drug known as GLPG2222 was safe and tolerable in a group of patients with cystic fibrosis. The drug also helped reduce chloride in patients' sweat — a test of cystic fibrosis — and increased patients' ability to forcefully expel air.But the lung function results were inferior to Vertex's results of tezacaftor plus ivacaftor in a failed Phase 3 trial, Porges said. On sweat chloride, GLPG2222 was inferior to Vertex's tezacaftor alone in a Phase 2 trial in the same patient population.""There is a vast amount of work in front of Galapagos and its potential partner AbbVie (ABBV) to challenge Vertex in this category,"" he said. ""These results do not yet compel us to alter our cystic fibrosis market.""IBD'S TAKE: Vertex started out in hepatitis C, but its efforts were dampened by Gilead Sciences' massive hepatitis C franchise. So it moved onto cystic fibrosis. See what transitioned the firm from its ""crisis"" by visiting The New America.Porges currently forecasts Galapagos having a 25% chance of success in cystic fibrosis, and maintained an outperform rating and 179 price target on Vertex.

1078,ADS,"Ford Motor (F) and General Motors (GM) topped December sales forecasts Wednesday, but the auto industry closed out a weaker year and faces an even worse 2018.X Overall, the annualized pace of U.S. sales fell to 17.23 million for all of 2017, according to Autodata, better than views for 17.1 million but down from 17.55 million in 2016, marking the first slowdown after seven years of growth. Analysts see a further drop to 16.7 million in 2018.Meanwhile, incentive spending is high; a glut of off-lease, used vehicles is muting new car demand; and rising interest rates could make vehicles less affordable. Automakers have cut production and idled factory workers to match slowing demand.Yet, strong sales of SUVs, crossover utility vehicles and pickup trucks are helping to offset what one industry expert called ""the near wholesale death"" of the passenger car.""This is a paradigm shift in consumer behavior, and the fallout will be reflected over the next few years as automakers make hard choices regarding which model lines will live or die,"" said Karl Brauer, executive editor of Kelley Blue Book.Automakers would do well to align product and marketing with consumer demand going forward, said Rebecca Lindland, executive analyst for KBB.As examples, she noted Ford's delay in bringing its globally successful Ecosport small SUV to the U.S. market; Fiat Chrysler's focus on the poorly received Patriot and Compass instead of the iconic Jeep brand; and GM's marketing emphasis on sports sedans, with TV ads showing Cadillacs being driven on cobblestone Manhattan streets, hardly the goal of most prospective buyers.Here's how the top auto brands fared in December, which saw an annualized sales pace of 17.9 million:Kelley Blue Book sales estimate: 294,000; down 7.9%Edmunds.com sales estimate: 301,617; down 5.5%Results: 308,539, down 3.3% vs. a year ago.

On a retail basis, 78% of GM sales are now trucks and crossovers, compared with an industry average of 65%, GM added.GM rose 2.4% to close at 42.82 on the stock market today, retaking the downward-sloping 50-day moving average.

1079,ADS,"European pharmaceutical firms AstraZeneca (AZN) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) pulled upgrades on Friday as analysts looked ahead to key 2018 clinical trial readouts in ovarian cancer and diabetes, respectively.X AstraZeneca rose 1.7% to 34.70 on the stock market today, while Novo Nordisk dipped a fraction to 53.67. JPMorgan analyst James Gordon upgraded AstraZeneca to an overweight rating. JPM's Richard Vosser boosted Novo Nordisk to a neutral rating.AstraZeneca's medium-term growth outlook is twice the European pharma sector, Gordon wrote in a note to clients. In 2018, he expects a return to topline growth with new launches being key, and he sees core earnings hitting a floor before rising in 2019.Gordon was bearish this year on a clinical trial testing a combination of immuno-oncology drugs in advanced lung cancer. In July, AstraZeneca said the regimen didn't shrink tumors. It had pinned its hopes on the trial, dubbed Mystic, and immuno-oncology in general.Now, the Mystic trial is continuing with a goal of improving overall survival, or OS.""Our bear key points in 2017 were an expectation for Mystic PFS (progression-free survival) failure and overly high base business and divestment expectations,"" he said. ""With Mystic PFS having failed and low expectations for the OS readout, we now see only modest downside.""AstraZeneca is also set to have data from a trial of its drug, Lynparza, as a first treatment for a form of ovarian cancer. There, it rivals Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and Tesaro (TSRO), but Gordon sees a high likelihood AstraZeneca will be successful in the trial is calls Solo-1.IBD'S TAKE: Large-cap biotechs and drugmakers suffered mounting competition in 2017 from newer therapies and generic rivalries. That theme is likely to continue into 2018, analysts say. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at what that trend could mean for bigger players.For 2019-'22, Gordon forecasts AstraZeneca achieving a 13% compound annual growth rate in core earnings per share, more than twice the sector at 6%. The market will likely focus on five key product launches in 2018, which could beat consensus views by 8% in aggregate, he said.Among those, he expects sales of lung cancer drug Tagrisso to top expectations by 26% in the U.S. in 2018. His 2022 forecast of $1.9 billion in U.S. sales could be achievable if just half of 15,000 patients with a specific mutation receive the therapy as a first treatment.""Based on much higher penetrations of comparable therapies, and with no competitors on the horizon, we think even our own forecast could prove conservative,"" he said.Outside the U.S, he assumes 50% price cuts in Europe and Japan for patients who receive the drug as a first treatment. In China, he expects 20% of eligible patients to receive Tagrisso and assumes a similar price cut.Gordon expects sales of immuno-oncology drug Imfinzi to be in line and sees Lynparza, which treats ovarian cancer, to post a small beat in 2018-'19. But he sees downside in the long-term for both drugs.AstraZeneca is also launching Calquence as a treatment for mantle cell lymphoma but with only 2,000 patients in the U.S. he sees near-term downside. AstraZeneca is also looking at the drug in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which affects a larger group of patients.Fasenra was also recently approved as a bi-monthly treatment for a form of asthma. But the drug rivals GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) Nucala, which is administered monthly. In 2019, it's likely Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' (REGN) and Sanofi's (SNY) Dupixent will get approval to treat asthma.For Novo Nordisk, 2018 will be a story of oral semaglutide, Vosser said. Oral semaglutide is being investigated in Phase 3 trials dubbed Pioneer as a treatment for type 2 diabetes. Oral semaglutide belongs to a class of drugs known as GLP-1 receptor agonists.Currently, GLP-1 drugs are only available as injections. Novo Nordisk looks to be the first to market with an oral GLP-1. Oramed Pharmaceuticals (ORMP) is also working on an oral GLP-1 drug, but it's far behind Novo Nordisk.""Given we see the oral semaglutide data living up to expectations, we don't see the Pioneer program being a source of disappointment to investors in 2018 and see the market leaving the more difficult commercial questions around the product until after the clinical profile is nailed down by the clinical trial results,"" Vosser said in a note to clients.Novo Nordisk is testing oral semaglutide vs. its own Victoza, Dow stock Merck's (MRK) Januvia and Eli Lilly's (LLY) Jardiance in a series of trials.RELATED:Why Clovis' Good News In Ovarian Cancer Prodded These Rivals DownTesaro Takes A Swipe At AstraZeneca's Ovarian Cancer Drug SalesWhy Tesaro's $2 Million Cancer-Drug Miss Prompted Its Rivals To Topple

1080,ADS,"We hear it all the time from stock market beginners to seasoned pros: Selling is the toughest part of investing.The reason? Emotions run high when facing a sell decision. Will the stock keep running higher without me? Is the recent sell-off a blip or the start of something much more serious?X How do you tame your doubts when locking in big profits or trimming a loss quickly? It all comes down to rules.Alibaba Group (BABA) is a case in point. The Chinese version of Amazon was a top-performing Leaderboard stock that got sent to the Cut List when it broke a simple rule.The removal actually rested on the stock's behavior in the months prior, as much as its action Dec. 1, when it was kicked out of the Leaders List with a profit of almost 60%.Alibaba went on Leaderboard April 10, as it cleared an alternate buy point at 110.55.  It was the next opportunity after a buy point at 101.67 from a cup with handle had passed. No matter, the Chinese online retail and internet powerhouse continued to climb with abandon. In fact, it didn't really break below the short-term 10-day moving average until early August.During the summer months, the stock made a series of modest pullbacks and new highs. That became an ascending base, an unusual pattern that tends to occur when a stock defies a sputtering general market.Alibaba broke out past the 177.10 buy point Sept. 13 (1). From that moment, however, the stock started having difficulties. There was little follow through on the breakout, and shares dipped below the 50-day moving average for the first time in the run Oct. 25 (2).A couple of days later, Alibaba was right back above the 50-day line, so there was no real threat. The company announced quarterly results Nov. 2, which happened to be the stock's peak. Despite a 63% surge in earnings and a 47% rise in sales, Alibaba failed to impress investors. Shares were aimless for several weeks, and Leaderboard editors started contemplating taking profits.The Nov. 29 sell-off in technology stocks shoved the stock below the 50-day line, this time with a deeper penetration below the line than any time in its advance (3). Volume was sharply higher than average that day and several that followed. The relative strength line had flattened out, which was another factor in the decision.But what really triggered the sell was the first close below the 10-week moving average in volume spike 36% above average. It was the first true break of support in the entire run — a clear sell signal (4). Once a stock has run up for more than 18 weeks, such a break of support takes on greater significance.Importantly, the 60% profit was more than sufficient to justify Alibaba's exit on Dec. 1 (5). Since then, Alibaba has remained below the 50-day line.Not all such breaks of the 10-week mean a stock is finished for good. Sometimes a deeper, longer base forms. But look at enough big winners and you'll see this recurring signal that big investors are bailing.With Leaderboard, investors can get the needed guidance, as market specialists study the selected stocks and annotate charts with the latest signals.

1085,ADS,"The final trading day of 2017 saw modest losses for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite in the afternoon as fourth quarter drew to a close.X Options abound about what's in store for the stock market in 2018, but the bull case still holds plenty of water. Leaders are generally acting well, big corporate tax cuts should continue to power earnings in 2018, while low interest rates could spur more M&A activity and a healthy IPO market.But it's important not to be too complacent, especially amid plenty of bullish sentiment in the market. When Wall Street comes back after the three-day weekend, continue to watch price and volume in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. The bulls want to see higher volume gains and lower-volume declines. The bears want to see more more signs of institutional selling, higher-volume declines in the indexes known as distributions days.The major stock indexes were down anywhere from 0.1% to 0.2%, with volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq tracking just above Thursday's light levels.Of the 30 Dow stocks, nine traded higher and 21 traded lower.

1090,ADS,"Hard-charging entrepreneurs turn their dreams into reality. And that's not easy.It's not enough to innovate, overcome obstacles and woo investors and customers. Goal-driven visionaries also need to transform their grandest dreams of success into practical building blocks on which they can ascend.To set effective goals that spur entrepreneurial triumphs:Stay close to customers. It's fine to dream, but stay grounded. As you formulate your business model, keep checking in with your target market to ensure you're on the right track.""Entrepreneurs tend to convince themselves that they're right and then set lofty goals,"" said Toby Rush, chief executive of Zoloz, a Kansas City, Mo.-based identity verification and biometrics platform. ""It's better to force yourself to do market validation early on and establish goals that flow from customer input.""Proceed in steps. Brimming with confidence and passion, entrepreneurs may set wildly ambitious goals and assume they'll attain them. But it may make more sense to do a reality check.""Entrepreneurs like to think their assumptions are correct, that they can go from zero to 100,"" said Rush, a serial entrepreneur who sold a previous firm to Alibaba Group (BABA) in 2016. ""But you have to set up incremental milestones along the way. You set your feet to the fire with the milestones.""Knowing what results you need to see each month or quarter helps you advance in steps toward your larger goal. If you miss a milestone, you can make course corrections and test different strategies while mitigating your overall risk.Heed wise counsel. Beware of setting goals in a vacuum. Instead, ask a trusted ally to help you distinguish between a realistic target and pie-in-the-sky aspirations.Rush, 43, remembers launching his first company in 2005. He kept modifying his business plan as various ideas ricocheted in his head.Finally, a board member said, ""Toby, how will we ever know if you're successful if you keep changing the idea?""""I was jumping around too much,"" Rush recalled. ""The lesson is, it's fine to change direction as long as you stick with your defined milestones and you're consistent in how you get from A to B.""Hire winners. You cannot turn dreams into reality on your own. You'll need to assemble a team of skilled, motivated stars to help you.To recruit winners, don't just focus on candidates' technical qualifications. Also consider their psychological makeup.""It's important to hire patriots, not mercenaries,"" said Jack Teboda, founder and chief executive of Teboda & Associates, a financial advisory firm in Elgin, Ill. ""Patriots have that inner drive. They'll help you reach your goals,"" while mercenaries lack the buy-in to go beyond the call of duty.Focus on how, not what. While important, goals themselves have limited value. The real driver of success is how you climb the ladder to attain your objective.For Courtney Reum, the process of setting goals is only part of the picture. He's co-author of ""Shortcut Your Startup.""""Goal-setting is not about digging in your heels for the sake of reaching a goal,"" he said. ""It's more about the tactics and action steps you take to get there.""Reum urges entrepreneurs to ask themselves, ""What are we doing to reach the goal? How will we get there?"" rather than ""What is the goal?""""It's not about the what,"" he said. ""It's about the how.""Balance micro and macro. Turning your dreams into dollars requires a mix of detailed analysis and big-picture visioning. Beware of neglecting one at the expense of the other.""A good entrepreneur needs a microscope in one eye and a telescope in the other,"" Reum said.

1092,ADS,"Shares of Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) dropped Tuesday after the generic drug giant rebuffed a request from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to spare hundreds of jobs tied to a Jerusalem facility.X By the closing bell on the stock market today, Teva fell 3.4% to close at 17.90, though it fell as much as 4.8%. Shares have lost about half their value since the beginning of the year amid competition for Teva's multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone.New Chief Executive Kare Schultz called the cuts — about 1,700 in Israel and 800 at the Jerusalem facility — ""painful"" steps to help the firm reduce some $35 billion in debt as of the end of the third quarter, according to a Bloomberg report.""The measures included in the restructuring plan are aimed to achieve our shared aspiration to sustain Teva as a strong global company, managed out of and based in Israel,"" Schultz reportedly said in a prepared statement.Without taking these steps, it's possible Teva could become a takeover candidate, the firm said. Teva didn't immediately return a request from Investor's Business Daily for comment.IBD'S TAKE: Teva has an IBD Composite Rating of 16 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it underperforms more than eight in 10 stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at better-rated generic drug stocks.In total, Teva expects to eliminate 14,000 positions globally and to close a number of manufacturing facilities by the end of 2019 to contend with its debt. The debt stems from Teva's $40.5 billion spend in 2016 to acquire Allergan's (AGN) generic unit.Analysts have applauded Teva for taking steps to cut $3 billion in costs by the end of 2019. Israeli officials, on the other hand, had hoped to work with Teva to reduce the number of dismissals by offering government help, according to a Bloomberg report.Others are reportedly calling on the government to rescind about $6.3 billion in tax breaks the generic drugmaker has received since 2006.

1100,ADS,"Apple (AAPL) paced a hearty gain for the Dow Jones industrial average at midday Tuesday, rising more than 2% to 173.49, amid a broad stock market rally.XApple is now extended past a 160.97 proper buy point in a cup with handle that formed from Sept. 5 to Oct. 26. The iPhone giant broke out on Oct. 27, ramping up 3.6% and past the handle's high of 160.87.Apple is also now up nearly 47% from a 118.12 buy point in a longer first-stage cup with handle. That base was part of a long bottoming base pattern, signaling a turnaround in the megacap consumer tech and digital services play.At 1 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average, up nearly 0.8%, also saw at least 10 other components within the 30-stock average rise 1 point or more.The S&P 500 rose a little less than 0.7%, and the Nasdaq composite led with a nearly 1% lift, courtesy of not only Apple but other megacap techs including Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL).Industry groups among the 197 tracked by IBD that led Tuesday's upside included automation machinery, residential construction, automaker, data storage, computer hardware, heavy construction and security software stocks, all up 1.8% or more.Chip equipment, fabless semiconductor, RV and mobile home, jewelry retail, farm machinery, agricultural chemical and truck transport firms also rallied 1% or more.The S&P SmallCap 600 advanced 1%, taking its year-to-date gain back into double-digit territory, up 10.4%. The S&P 500, at 2598, reached all-time new highs and is up 16% since Jan. 1.Alphabet, up almost 1% to 1,045.52 in below-average turnover, remains in buy range after clearing a well-formed flat base with a 1,006.29 buy point.The proper buy range for any breakout goes up to 5% past the buy point; in Alphabet's case, it's 1,056.60. The reason: IBD's system of buying and selling great stocks definitely involves grabbing shares when the stock is rushing into new high ground, showing outstanding relative strength.But if one buys more than 5% past a proper buy point, the risk of getting handed a fast loss goes up sharply as many top-notch market leaders often pull back after a brief run, sometimes even falling below the proper buy point.Alphabet went public at a split-adjusted 42.50 a share in August 2004. The first breakout arrived just two months later when Alphabet soared past a 56.05 buy point in a first-stage IPO base.IBD Stock Checkup scores good ratings for the megacap tech. Alphabet gets a sterling 98 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 (terrible) to 99 (terrific), while the B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating points to net buying by large funds over the past 13 weeks.The Street expects Alphabet, which still gets the lion's share of its revenue from ads, to post a 32% jump in fourth-quarter profit to $9.98 a share. Profit rose 7%, 28%, 27% and 32% vs. year-ago levels in the prior four quarters, marking a bullish accelerating trend.Elsewhere in the stock market today, Tesla (TSLA) continues to rebound mildly after a big gap-down on Nov. 2. The electric-car leader rose nearly 2% to 314.55 in fast turnover, but still remains below the 200-day moving average. According to report on CNBC Tuesday, Morgan Stanley on Tuesday said Tesla could reach 400 a share but that a sharp pullback could follow after that.Notice on a daily chart how Tesla's 50-day line has been sloping markedly lower for more than four weeks. Watch to see if the big-cap transport play gains enough strength to potentially test upside resistance at not only the 200-day line but the medium-term 50-day.While Wall Street still largely expects the Elon Musk-led company to lose money at least through full-year 2018, the company continues to show robust revenue growth and strong operating cash flow.While Tesla lost $2.87 a share in 2016, it actually posted a positive cash flow from operations of $3.84 a share.Meanwhile, several stocks have triggered IBD's offense-type sell signal.Agilent Technologies (A) had a wild day, rising off early-morning lows to gain a smidgen to 70.09 and notch new highs. The scientific and electronic measuring instruments giant has rallied more than 20% to 25% since clearing a narrow five-week flat base at 54.92 in late April.However, those with supreme conviction in the stock can decide to hold longer and take profits when a defense-type sell signal triggers, such as a sharp break through the 10-week moving average in huge weekly turnover.Agilent is likely to extend its streak of low-double-digit profit growth as Wall Street sees earnings rising 13% to 60 cents a share in the January-ending fiscal first quarter. Earnings have risen 12%, 16%, 11%, 18%, 15%, 32%, 20% and 14% vs. year-ago levels in the past eight quarters.Chinese high-growth companies continued to shine amid a nearly 2% lift for the Hang Seng benchmark in Hong Kong.E-commerce facilitator and Leaderboard stock 58.com (WUBA) jumped for a fourth day in a row, rising nearly 3% to 78.50 in heavy trading. As noted in Leaderboard, the midcap consumer-spending play gave investors a follow-on entry point when it burst back above the 50-day moving average near 65 on Oct. 30 and 31.Shares have since rallied more than 20%.IBD's TAKE: Taking many gains when your stock has risen 20% to 25% past a proper buy point is an excellent way to build a strong overall return. Not only are you locking in gains in a stock on the way up, but you are also freeing up cash to possibly put into another top market leader. Read more about this offense-type sell signal in Investor's Corner.In other financial markets, Germany's DAX 30 stabilized, rising 0.8% amid struggles by German Chancellor Angela Merkel to form a ruling coalition following recent elections. The equities benchmark, at 13,168, pulled back 5% from an all-time high of 13,525 in recent weeks but is finding support at the rising 50-day moving average.WTI crude oil futures rebounded 0.5% to $56.71 a barrel, maintaining its torrid run since late June's low near $42.53, up 33%. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note held steady at 2.37%, still below a year-to-date high of 2.62%.RELATED:Which New Public Companies Will Emerge As The Future Cisco, Google and Microsoft?How To Find The Next Great IPOs: Check This ScreenHow To Search For The Best Growth Stocks: Start Here

1104,ADS,"Institutional investors are showing a strong interest in the initial public offering of China search-engine company Sogou (SOGO), which is set to begin trading Thursday.XIPO research and advisory firm IPOboutique.com in a report Tuesday said its channel checks reveal, according to underwriter guidance, that the order for shares is ""many multiple times oversubscribed,"" meaning the request for shares is much higher than what's being made available.China-based Sohu (SOHU), an internet service company that includes search and gaming platforms, holds the largest stake in Sogou.Beijing-based Sogou plans to raise $540 million by offering 45 million American depositary shares at a price range of 11 to 13, giving it a fully diluted market value of about $4.8 billion. IPOboutique.com said its sources indicate there is a ""possibility"" of an above-range pricing.Sogou is also backed by China-based internet giant Tencent Holdings (TCEHY).

1105,ADS,"Shares of China-based online credit firm Qudian (QD) opened more than 43% higher in the company's first few minutes of trading Wednesday a windfall that came on top of an initial public offering that already had priced above its estimated range.XQudian priced 37.5 million American depositary receipts at $24, above the expected range of $19 to $22, thus raising $900 million.

1107,ADS,"The latest official Chinese government data from the third quarter highlight a huge reason why the five top-performing stocks in IBD's Internet-Content industry group all are from China, including Weibo (WB).Meanwhile, China is home to three of the four top-rated stocks in IBD's Retail-Internet industry group, with Alibaba Group (BABA) leading the pack based on a composite of earnings, sales, margin and stock performance trends.The reason: China's e-commerce boom is still enjoying accelerating growth.While China's economy grew a solid 6.8% during the third quarter, online sales in the world's most populous nation have grown at a pace that is roughly five times that rate so far this year, official government figures released Thursday showed.China online sales jumped 34.2% for the first nine months of 2017. That's an acceleration from a 26.1% growth rate for the same period in 2016, and a 33.4% pace for the first half of 2017.The most explosive growth came in sales of services, such as travel and entertainment, which surged 52.8% from a year ago.Online sales of physical goods rose 29.1% in the first three quarters, up from 28.6% growth in the first half of 2017. Online sales made up 14% of total retail sales of consumer goods, up 2.2 percentage points from a year ago.China's accelerating e-commerce growth has fueled profit growth and stock gains.IBD'S TAKE: For advanced chart analysis of leading stocks like Alibaba, 58.com and Amazon, try IBD Leaderboard, where IBD's top market writers help you spot buying opportunities as they emerge and sell signals to lock in profits.

1108,ADS,"Authorities in Macau said that they would evaluate and tighten up gambling laws and plan to increase restrictions on junket operators in January, potentially weighing on sales for casino resort operators like Las Vegas Sands (LVS), Wynn Macau (WYNN), MGM Resorts International (MGM) and Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO).XThose plans, outlined in a yearly address from Macau Chief Executive Fernando Chui, would come as gaming in the area — a Chinese special administrative and the only area in the nation where gambling is legal — continues to rebound despite the threat of greater regulatory scrutiny.Even as Macau tries to diversify its economy, the global gaming hub some two weeks ago posted its 15 straight month of sales gains, following a long stretch of declines due to anti-money laundering efforts and a general corruption crackdown. Melco Resorts & Entertainment this month reported Q3 results that beat forecasts, helped by gains in Macau and the Philippines.""The government will review and strengthen the gaming rules,"" Chui said, according to Bloomberg. ""The government will also regulate junket operations, promote responsible gaming and boost the Macau casino industry's competitiveness.""China in recent years has accused junket operators, the middlemen who loan VIPs money and otherwise try to entice them into casinos, of money laundering. Macau has also capped daily ATM withdrawal limits for China UnionPay cardholders and installed facial-recognition technology on ATMs.Las Vegas Sands rose 2 cents to 67.27 in the stock market today. Wynn Resorts dipped 1.1%. Melco Resorts sank about 2%. MGM Resorts, less exposed to Macau than the other global giants, dipped 0.6%.Separately, International Game Technology (IGT) gapped 15.1% higher to 27.45 after the maker of casino gaming machines reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings.

1109,ADS,"Thanks to the shale boom, the U.S. is set to boost oil and gas production to unprecedented levels by 2025, but OPEC will take back market power longer term, the International Energy Agency said Tuesday.XThe Paris-based energy watchdog estimated in its annual World Energy Outlook report that domestic output would jump 25% — to 30 million barrels of oil equivalent per day from 24 million currently. The U.S. had already topped Russia in 2011 to be the world's No. 1 oil and gas producer, but the IEA's forecast would put the U.S. head and shoulders ahead of any rivals.""A remarkable ability to unlock new resources cost-effectively pushes combined United States oil and gas output to a level 50% higher than any other country has ever managed,"" according to the report.Oil prices fell Tuesday, after the IEA cut its 2017 and 2018 oil demand forecast by 100,000 barrels per day, in the agency's monthly report. Brent fell 1.5% to $62.21 per barrel. U.S. crude was off 1.9% to $55.70.Shares of Exxon Mobil (XOM) were down 0.8% on the stock market today, Chevron (CVX) lost 0.3%, BP (BP) eased by 0.7%, and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) dipped 0.2%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Thanks to advances by shale producers like EOG Resources (EOG), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), Continental Resources (CLR) and Diamondback Energy (FANG), U.S. shale oil production is expected to grow by 8 million barrels per day from 2010 to 2025, exceeding the growth that Saudi Arabia saw from the 1960s to the 1980s.The IEA estimates that this boom will account for 80% of the growth in the world's oil supply by 2025 and will allow the U.S. to become a net oil exporter by the late 2020s.U.S. shale exploration and production companies weathered a global, two-year industry glut by tightening belts, cutting costs and adopting novel technological advances aimed at increasing production and lowering break-even costs.But shale production should start to decline starting in the middle of next decade, the IEA added, as a slower pace of investment weighs on longer-term output. That should let OPEC boost its market share to 46% by 2040 from about 43% today.Still, there are many other factors at play over the long term. The IEA noted the U.S. shale sector's history of beating expectations; the shift to electric vehicles putting downward pressure on oil demand; and changes in estimates of recoverable shale reserves.RELATED: Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, Coal

1110,ADS,"Roku (ROKU), Snapchat parent Snap (SNAP) and Sogou (SOGO) are all 2017 IPOs, but with different chart action. Roku skyrocketed 70% last week on its first-ever quarterly report since coming public. Snap crashed on yet another disappointing quarter as it struggles vs. much-larger Facebook (FB). Sogou, a Chinese search engine from Sohu (SOHU), had a solid first two days after pricing at the high end of its IPO last week.X But you should use the same investing strategy for all three new stocks, and recent initial public offerings generally. Wait for a newly public company to prove itself by setting up in a proper base and breaking out.Roku came public at $14 a share in late September, and on its second day of trading hit an intraday peak of 29.80. But then shares pulled back to 18.35 on Oct. 25. Shares closed at 18.84 last Wednesday.But late Wednesday Roku reported an adjusted loss of just 10 cents a share as revenue swelled 40% to $124.8 million. Analysts expected a 28-cent loss on sales of $110.50 million. Growth in users and revenue per user was strong.Shares shot up 55% to 29.19 on Thursday. Then on Friday, Roku leapt 13.9% to 33.25 in Friday's stock market trading, clearing a 29.90 buy point.Why not buy when Roku first came public, or right ahead of earnings. Anyone who did that would up a lot more than those that waited for Roku to hit 29.90 buy point. But investors had no way of knowing that the stock would ultimately rebound. If Roku had reported weak results or guidance, the stock could be trading at all-time lows.The Snapchat operator shows the downside of buying early. Like Roku, Snap rallied for its first two days, then began retreating. Unlike Roku, Snap continued to fall as it has now reported three quarters of disappointing results. Late Tuesday, Snap fell well short of third-quarter revenue and user growth levels. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, who earlier this year had laughed at the idea that Facebook was a serious threat, admitted that many people found the Snapchat ""hard to use.""Snap fell 14.6% on Wednesday, even with Chinese internet giant Tencent (TCEHY) taking a big stake. Snap closing the week at 12.76. While not a record low, shares are well below the IPO price of 17 and the all-time high of 29.44.As for Facebook, the FANG stock is in buy range from a recent breakout. But the social media giant had a disastrous IPO start. After hitting 45 soon after trading opened in May 2012, shares closed that day right around the 38 IPO price. Facebook hit a record-low 17.55 in September, and didn't set a new high until September 2013.The Chinese search engine rival to Baidu (BIDU) priced its IPO at 13, the high end of its expected range. Shares rose to 13.50 in Thursday's debut and then to 13.81 on Friday. That's a solid start, but as Roku and Snap show, you have no real idea how Sogou will perform after just two days.On the upside, Sogou is profitable and has shown accelerating revenue growth in recent quarters. Sohu is the main shareholder, but Tencent also has a big stake.IPOs will go in different directions, but you should stick to the same path. Wait for the dust to settle and only consider investing when the stock presents a sound buying opportunity.RELATED:IPO Stock News And Analysis: Find Today's Top New Issues Snap's Three LessonsIPO Leaders: See Today's Top-Performing IPO StocksA Tale Of 4 IPOs: Facebook, Alibaba, Snap And SquareWhat Are Today's Fastest-Growing Companies?Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy?

1112,ADS,"As the late 2016 Trump Trade fades in the rearview mirror, $10.3 billion American Century Ultra Fund (TWCUX) is shining brighter. Boosted by such leading stock holdings as Cognex (CGNX), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Netflix (NFLX), the fund's 28.07% gain this year going into Thursday topped 76% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Direct. In all of 2016, the fund advanced just 4.38%, beating only 58% of its peers.X""2016 was overall a value-style year where the Russell 1000 Value Index outperformed the Russell 1000 Growth Index by over 10 (percentage points),"" said client portfolio manager Kevin Lewis. ""In that context Ultra's higher growth portfolio, which should be rewarded over time, faced a headwind.""The fund lagged the most in the fourth quarter. ""Coming out of the (2016) election, investors were excited about the prospect of government stimulus helping the economy,"" Lewis said. ""With that, many cyclical stocks did well. Many of those we don't own because they are value-oriented and we are a growth-oriented fund.""But this year growth stocks have grabbed back performance leadership. That has allowed Ultra's strategy to strut its stuff. ""Our focus is on higher-quality businesses with extensive growth opportunities over the long term,"" Lewis said. ""We invest in many innovative companies creating disruption and creating new ways of developing products and services.""Reflecting that appetite for innovation, the fund's top sectors as of Aug. 31 were technology, consumer discretionary and health care, with asset weightings of about 40%, 19% and 17%, respectively.The portfolio's day-to-day decisions have been made by lead manager Keith Lee and managers Michael Li and Jeffrey Bourke since 2008. This year's fund showing is more in line with its longer-term record, like its five-year average annual gain of 17.71%, topping 80% of its rivals.What's driving some of the fund's key holdings?The fund began its current stake in Cognex last June. ""They are a machine vision company with products that are essential to automated production and also quality assurance at high rates of production speed,"" Lewis said. ""Their machine vision software systematically interprets what is being seen by the camera and is focused on guiding, inspecting, gauging and identification across a multitude of scenarios such as guiding a robot to put a screen on a smartphone.""Key customers in 2016 included BMW and Apple (AAPL).Cognex earnings per share rose 87%, 75%, 91%, 19% and 91% the past five quarters. That's helped lead the stock to a No. 1 ranking in IBD's Electronics-Scientific/Measuring industry group. In addition to beating analysts' expectations for third-quarter earnings and revenue, the company guided Q4 revenue estimates higher.IBD'S TAKE: Cognex is ranked No. 14 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks.June is also when the fund began its current position in Adobe Systems — which also happens to be ranked No. 1 in its industry group. The company provides software for digital publishing and marketing. The stock ""is high quality as shown by their operating margin of over 25%,"" Lewis said. ""We believe there will be sustained growth opportunities for them due to a shift of advertising spending from traditional media to digital media, an increasing usage of video content in ads and a shift from desktop to mobile, which needs new content creation.""The managers also like Adobe's transition to a more subscription-based customer revenue model, which provides greater stability, Lewis says. Adobe is another IBD 50 stock.Netflix is yet another stock ranked No. 1 in its IBD industry group (Leisure-Movies & Related). Its earnings per share have grown at a triple-digit pace in three of the past four quarters. ""Our long-term thesis is that Netflix is benefiting from cord-cutting,"" Lewis said, referring to consumers who are dropping cable subscriptions in pursuit of lower-cost entertainment through streaming services like Netflix's.""People are moving away from traditional cable, to over-the-top entertainment options,"" Lewis added. ""Netflix's revenues were up 30% last quarter and cash flow was up about 97%. Subscriber growth is strong, and it's growing overseas as well.""Ultra Fund's lineup of innovators includes Amazon.com (AMZN). Lewis says the fund's managers are confident that the stock's recent slowdown in EPS growth is due to investments that will pay off long-term. ""Amazon has been reinvesting (cash flow) to drive growth in the long term,"" Lewis said. ""Meanwhile, it remains very disruptive in retail and cloud computing.""Likewise, Facebook (FB) has been a core holding for a long time, Lewis says. ""Their core social platform is dominant, and they are just starting to monetize Instagram and Messenger,"" he said.""They're really benefiting from the shift to digital advertising from traditional platforms,"" he added.Early this month, Facebook's third-quarter results beat views. But shares have traded sideways since the company disclosed plans for increased spending, in part to boost security after disclosures about Russia's misinformation campaign during the U.S. presidential campaign, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in congressional hearings.RELATED:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

1113,ADS,"Several initial public offerings scheduled for this week are receiving strong interest from institutional investors, with the largest IPO being China-based Qudian (QD), a provider of loans and credit vehicles that is backed by China e-commerce leader Alibaba (BABA).XAlso coming is Singapore-based internet company Sea Ltd. (SE), which is backed by China gaming leader Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), and database software provider MongoDB (MDB).Qudian, which has a close relationship with Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial, looks to raise $769 million by offering 37.5 million American depositary shares at a price range of $19 to $22.

1124,ADS,"In what is now the largest single day of shopping worldwide, China e-commerce leader Alibaba (BABA), in the first six hours of its ""11.11 Global Shopping Festival,"" managed $13 billion in sales, the company said, putting it on pace to easily surpass last year's sales of $17.8 billion.XThe 24-hour event started at midnight on Saturday in Shanghai, or 11 a.m. ET Friday morning, starting with festival events that launched on Oct. 31.The company is expected to generate sales of about $24 billion when the event is completed, according to SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.The Alibaba 11.11 Global Shopping Festival initially began as ""Singles Day,"" in which college students picked Nov. 11 to celebrate being single, with the idea of inviting Chinese consumers to buy themselves gifts in the spirit of an ""Anti-Valentine's"" Day.Alibaba adopted and promoted the theme starting in 2009. It has since evolved into a day when consumers in China — single or not — buy gifts and celebrate. Alibaba also transitioned the event from being a 24-hour online sale into a 24-day festival, along with celebrations, shopping specials, concerts and other events.This year, Alibaba says more than 140,000 brands will be available for purchase through its e-commerce platforms, including Tmall and Taobao, up from 98,000 last year.The theme of this year's festival is ""New Retail,"" which describes the numerous ways that Alibaba attempts to engage consumers, both online and offline.

Alibaba shares are up 76% after a breakout from a 104.67 cup-with-handle buy point in February. Here's a simple routine about how to invest in stocks.The Alibaba festival towers over U.S. shopping events known as Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Black Friday last year had gross merchandise volume of $4.5 billion, and Cyber Monday had $3 billion, which when combined add up to less than half the take from Alibaba's event.Amazon (AMZN) appeared to take notice of Alibaba's one-day shopping event and created one it its own.

It's primarily a large-cap fund, with an average capitalization of $23.5 billion.Looking at the most recent economic reports, you might think it's time to tap the brakes on China. GDP growth slowed to 6.8% in Q3 from 7.5% a year earlier, and is well off the peak 15% growth under previous President Hu Jintau.Economic policies introduced in 2015 ""called for a slower pace of growth as the country's economy matures and transitions from a production-oriented focus to a services-based and consumption-oriented economy,"" analysts at Wells Fargo Investment Institute wrote in a report. ""While we expect Chinese economic growth to slow in the coming years, we also anticipate that policymakers will actively utilize credit levers to help cushion the slowdown.""The slowdown has not kept China equities from rallying. The MSCI China index surged nearly 50% from Jan. 1 to the end of October, according to Bloomberg data cited by Global X.Global X's own take on China is that the strongest economic theme is the rising spending power of China's middle class. Jay Jacobs, a Global X analyst, wrote in a Nov. 8 report that holiday and travel sales reflect that growth.China's Singles Day saw $17.8 billion in total sales on Nov. 11 last year, 32% above 2015's figures and six times more than Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined in the U.S.The ETF also appears to be forming a flat base, but still has a way to go before it climbs back to the all-time high of 21.23 seven years ago. The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

1138,ADS,"Tesaro (TSRO) took a swipe at AstraZeneca's (AZN) third-quarter sales report Thursday, suggesting $10 million of the revenue it recorded for ovarian cancer drug Lynparza was inventory buildup, not necessarily patients switching from its rival drug Zejula.XLynparza in the U.S. brought in $37 million in sales, beating the consensus for $29 million, RBC analyst Kennen MacKay said. The 61% sequential growth, in timing with a broader label for Lynparza, suggests AstraZeneca could be taking share from Tesaro, he said.AstraZeneca, Tesaro and Clovis Oncology (CLVS) all make drugs to treat ovarian cancer. These rivaling drugs belong to a class called PARP inhibitors. In August, Lynparza gained a broader label that allows it to treat a bigger population of ovarian cancer patients with a tablet.Following that, AstraZeneca noted ""an immediate encouraging uplift in new patient starts.""But Tesaro said Thursday after AstraZeneca's earnings release that data from health care tracker IMS implies 13% growth in demand during the quarter, MacKay said in a later note to clients. That would equate to $26 million in third-quarter sales for Lynparza.""We believe reported sales include approximately $10 million of stocking of Lynparza capsules before withdrawal from the market and Lynparza tablets prior to launch, which would be anticipated ahead of the transition,"" Tesaro reportedly told MacKay and other analysts.IBD'S TAKE: AstraZeneca has an IBD Composite Rating of 70 out of a best-possible 99, making it the seventh in its Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group. Get a look at better-rated stocks by visiting IBD Stock Checkup.Tesaro also believes about half of Lynparza use is outside of ovarian cancer to treat breast and prostate cancers. This would have contributed to the majority of sequential demand for Lynparza, the firm reportedly said.Tesaro estimates about a quarter of the ovarian cancer maintenance market has been penetrated by PARP inhibitors. Maintenance therapies help to avoid or slow a cancer's return if the cancer is in complete remission after the initial treatment.""Zejula has approximately a 60% share of the PARP inhibitors being used in ovarian cancer,"" Tesaro told the analysts. ""More than 90% of Zejula use is in patients with ovarian, fallopian and primary peritoneal cancer.""AstraZeneca's press release doesn't detail whether inventory buildup is included in its Lynparza sales figure for the quarter. AstraZeneca representatives told Investor's Business Daily the firm doesn't share the breakdown of net sales for its products.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Tesaro had tanked 7.6% to close at 91.01. This follows its own earnings report Wednesday in which sales of Zejula lagged the consensus by about $2 million. AstraZeneca fell 0.7% to 33.11. Clovis dipped 2.3% to finish at 67.21.Outside of its PARP inhibitor, AstraZeneca's total sales for the quarter grew 9% to $6.23 billion and topped the consensus for $5.75 billion. The firm also posted 54 cents earnings per share, down 32%, and lagging analysts' view for 57 cents.AstraZeneca updated its full-year guidance. It now expects core earnings per share to be at the low side of a low- to midteens percentage decline, on a constant-currency basis. The company maintained its guidance for a low to mid single-digit percentage decline in sales.Shares of drugmaker Perrigo (PRGO) rocketed to a 12-month high after the firm crushed analysts' expectations for the third-quarter. At the close, Perrigo jumped 8.4% to 87.99, after earlier rising as much as 13%.Perrigo's sales declined 2% to $1.23 billion, but that topped analysts' forecasts for $1.17 billion in sales. Adjusted income of $1.39 per share advanced 13% and smashed the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for adjusted earnings of $1.12 per share.Perrigo's consumer health care business in the U.S. declined 2% to $599 million and internationally fell 3% to $365 million. The company credited this to ""actions taken last year to sell nonprofitable businesses."" Prescription pharmaceutical sales dipped 1% to $251 million.But the company boosted its guidance for adjusted earnings to $4.80-$4.95 per share.RELATED:Why Tesaro's $2 Million Cancer-Drug Miss Prompted Its Rivals To ToppleNektar, Acadia Pop On Street-Crushing Quarters, But Tesaro DipsIncyte Rises On A Beat-And-Raise, Expanding Deal With AstraZeneca

1140,ADS,"Want to know how MFS Growth Fund (MFEGX) outperformed 75% of its large-cap growth peers this year? Look at its portfolio, rich in leaders, featuring the entire cast of FAANG stocks — Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) — as of Sept. 30. Their year-to-date gains range from Alphabet's 34% to Netflix's 59%.XThose FAANG stocks help make technology the $16.6 billion fund's largest sector, with a 28% weighting. Among the fund's other tech stocks are big contributors such as digital media and marketing software firm Adobe Systems (ADBE) and graphics-chip maker Nvidia (NVDA). Those two are up 79% and 96% respectively.The fund's diversification helps too. Big contributors include nontech names like cosmetics maker Estee Lauder (EL), which is up 61% this year. All together, the fund was up 29.4% in 2017 going into Thursday, according to Morningstar Direct.That's well above its 2.21% gain for all of 2016. ""We were doing well for most of 2016, but (we) lost a lot of ground in November on the 'Trump Trade,' "" said co-manager Paul Gordon. He was referring to the late 2016 stock market rally in which many investors favored lower-quality, more-cyclical stocks that they expected would benefit from policies enacted by a Republican White House and Congress.But the fund caught up big-time when investors started favoring growth stocks at the beginning of the year.The fund's performance relative to its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Direct has slipped somewhat in the past three months too. ""September '17 was a lighter version of the same (low-quality, cycle-focused) trade on the prospects of tax reform, which set us back a little that month,"" added Gordon. ""However, we maintain our focus on owning cross-cycle, above-average growers.""That translates into seeking stocks whose growth is above average and is sustainable no matter which way the political winds blow. ""We are looking for stocks that can grow earnings and free cash flow at rates above the market's growth for the long duration,"" Gordon said, referring to himself and co-managers Eric Fischman and Matthew Sabel.Gordon likes the long runway that he sees still in front of Nvidia. ""The thesis here is that Nvidia is exposed to some of the areas of technology with the largest potential addressable markets, and they have strong competitive market strengths in each,"" Gordon said.Nvidia chips have been popular in gaming, which provides about 60% of the firm's sales, Gordon says. In addition, data center operators have seen in recent years that strings of GPUs (graphics processing units) can power their computer needs more efficiently than regular CPUs, so now Nvidia's GPUs are being used in high-performance data centers, machine learning and driverless automobile functions.""Growth has accelerated in their data center business as well as in their autonomous-driving business,"" Gordon said. ""Nvidia has leadership in each. And it's able to spend to build share in each.""Adobe's earnings per share (EPS) growth has accelerated, rising 42%, 44% and 47% in the past three quarters.Gordon likes the stock's strategic position. ""We like the market they're in and their transition to subscriber selling (from legacy software),"" Gordon said. ""It expands the number of people who've bought the product, it reduces piracy, it makes revenue more recurring and it improves free cash flow conversion.""Gordon likes the firm's rate and duration of growth, which he says should lead to higher incremental margins.IBD'S TAKE: You can see how Adobe's strengths — like its 48% three-year EPS growth rate — stack up against its peers' at the stock's easy-to-read IBD Stock Checkup page.Netflix EPS grew at a triple-digit clip in three of the past four quarters. The fund has built its stake in recent portfolio disclosures.Gordon expects the internet content distributor to keep doing good things in the near term. ""They've been able to offer an incredible amount of content at attractive prices,"" he said. ""So they've done a tremendous job of raising their subscriber base in the U.S. and internationally. That's led to an ability to get pricing (increases) because they provide value.""Gordon added, ""We think there are still huge opportunities for (their subscriber) number to grow in the coming year.""Amazon is another name in which the fund has boosted its stake in recent disclosures. He likes both halves of its business. ""We think of Amazon as almost two companies within one,"" he said, citing Amazon Web Services and the firm's e-commerce side. ""We see potential for both businesses to be much bigger down the road.""Nor is Gordon antsy about Amazon's hefty investment spending. ""Amazon has always spent and typically run fairly low margins, and it's paid off over time,"" he said. ""It's an area to watch. But they have earned the trust of investors that their investments will pay off in time as future market-share gains.""Facebook is a third name in which the fund has been building its stake. ""The core Facebook business is still growing at a high rate,"" he said. ""And they've only started to monetize businesses like Instagram and WhatsApp.""Facebook has also positively surprised many investors. ""About a year ago they guided that the core business could decelerate as they slowed ad loads — ads that you see in Facebook streaming. But demand has been so strong that revenues this year are coming in better than the market expected.""RELATED:Retirement Investors Have Gained From Tech And Financial Stocks Driving MFS Growth FundYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

Rest of world sales lagged at $743.3 million vs. models for $745 million.""The U.S. segment was therefore relatively stable vs. competitors, in our view,"" Koffler said.The guidance suggests at least $250 million in positive revenue benefit and $80 million in net income benefit from the recent launch of a generic version of Copaxone in a single quarter, Koffler said.

1142,ADS,"China search engine company Sogou is set to launch an initial public offering next week that looks to raise $540 million, with Sohu.com (SOHU) holding the largest stake.Beijing-based Sogou, which is also backed by Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), will offer 45 million American depositary shares at a price range of $11 to $13, giving it a fully diluted market value of about $4.8 billion. Sohu.com will be the controlling shareholder in Sogou.Shares of Sohu, when combined with Tencent Holdings and members of management, will together have approximately 97.1% of total voting power, according to the Sogou prospectus.The lead underwriters are JPMorgan and Credit Suisse. Sogou will list under the ticker SOGO on the New York Stock Exchange. It is set to price late Tuesday and begin trading Wednesday.Based on data from iResearch, Sogou says it's the second-largest search engine in China by mobile queries, behind Baidu.com (BIDU).Last week, Baidu reported third-quarter revenue that topped views but forecast December-quarter sales that were well below estimates.Sogou said it intends to deepen its relationship with Tencent, which is China's leader in messaging services. In October, according to the prospectus, Tencent began testing the integration of Sogou Search into its WeChat messaging platform.According to iResearch, China's online search revenue in 2016 was about $11.5 billion, and is expected to reach $30.7 billion in 2021.Sogou considers its strategic strength to be its prowess in artificial intelligence. It expects the IPO to reap $501 million in net proceeds, which it will use for research and development, sales and marketing, and general corporate services, the company said.For the six-month period ended June 30, Sogou reported revenue of $373.2 million, up 16% from the same period a year ago. It reported net income of $35.7 million, compared with $25.3 million.IBD'S TAKE: The biggest stock market winners typically make their major price moves within a few months or years of their initial public offering.

1143,ADS,"NetEase (NTES), China's second-largest video game publisher, is deepening a push into e-commerce with plans to increase spending on products from the U.S., Europe and Japan to sell to local consumers.XThe company's Kaola e-commerce business will buy about $11 billion of inventory over the next three years from the U.S., Europe and Japan to woo customers with everything from Dutch baby formula to Japanese cosmetics, Kaola Chief Executive Zhang Lei said in an interview. The number will probably be higher after factoring in purchases from Australia and South Korea.""This industry could be worth ($75 billion) by about 2021,"" Lei said. ""This is a new racecourse — Kaola wants to be a major leader here and capture much of the market share from the existing leaders.""Best known for games, including bringing global title Overwatch to the Chinese market, NetEase is bolstering growth by tapping into local demand for established international brands. Overseas health supplements and cosmetics have gained favor in recent years among a populace unnerved by a rash of safety scares.While Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) dominates e-commerce in the country by acting as a digital landlord to sellers, Kaola buys almost all its inventory directly from companies overseas, bypassing local distributors and middlemen to lower costs.Kaola is the biggest player in China's cross-border e-commerce sector with about 24% of the market in the first half of 2017, according to data from iiMedia Research. That's ahead of Alibaba's Tmall Global with 20% and Vipshop Holdings (VIPS) 16%.In the next three years, Kaola will buy $3 billion of products from U.S. companies, Lei said. She singled out health supplement chain GNC Holdings (GNC) among its favored suppliers. This comes on top of announcements made last week and in April that the company would spend $4.4 billion in Japan and $3.5 billion across Europe respectively over the same period. Further funds would be spent buying stock from Australia and South Korea, she added.Bhavtosh Vajpayee, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, is currently projecting NetEase to generate $9 billion in e-commerce sales across its platform over the next three years. Cross-border e-commerce may triple to 15% of the total e-commerce market within five years if it's not curbed by new regulations, according to McKinsey & Co. The channel is projected to grow 43% in 2018, with goods valued at roughly $114.2 billion, according to McKinsey and iResearch.E-commerce has rapidly transformed from a side business into a core part of NetEase's future. The division that houses Kaola now accounts for 21% of revenue. The company doesn't disclose specific sales for the business.The company is opening a 74-acre warehouse in Ningbo that is licensed to handle cross-border e-commerce.

1144,ADS,"Tesaro (TSRO) stock plunged to a 14-month low Wednesday after reporting sales of ovarian cancer drug Zejula that came in more than $2 million below analysts' expectations — prodding rivals Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and AstraZeneca (AZN) to also topple.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Tesaro had plunged 12.2% to finish at 98.44, after earlier plummeting in heavy volume to a low it last saw in September 2016. Meanwhile, shares of Clovis and AstraZeneca dropped 4.1% and 0.8%, respectively.For the quarter, Zejula brought in $39.4 million in sales, below the consensus view for $41.6 million, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez wrote in a note to clients. He blamed this on higher-than-expected free drug rates and estimated compliance rates that missed assumptions.Fernandez had assumed $45 million in Zejula sales based on expectations for 2,478 patients on the drug in September. Tesaro reported about 2,500 patients that month, but indicated the rate of free drug samples was 25%-30%, at the upper end of prior guidance for 20%-30%.""Also, management estimates that the compliance rate may be closer to 85% (vs. our estimate of 90%),"" he said. ""If we apply the high end of the free-drug range (30%) and compliance of 85%, our model calculates $39.7 million in third-quarter sales, in line with the actual $39.4 million reported by Tesaro.""IBD'S TAKE: Fellow biotech Regeneron has been on a multiyear run since November 2010. See where Regeneron has enjoyed its support — and how to identify similar patterns — by visiting the Investor's Corner.He cut his price target on Tesaro to 137 from 140.

1146,ADS,"U.S. crude production rose to an all-time high last week while inventories unexpectedly rose last week, the Energy Information Administration reported Wednesday. Crude oil prices fell modestly as traders also mulled declining China imports and continued Mideast uncertainty.XU.S. production rose to 9.62 million barrels per day, up from 9.553 million bpd and the highest since EIA began tracking weekly data in 1983.Crude supplies rose by 2.2 million barrels, EIA said. Analysts had expected a drop of 2.7 million barrels. Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said U.S. stockpiles fell by 1.562 million barrels.Gasoline inventories fell by 3.3 million barrels.U.S. crude futures closed down 0.7% to $56.81 a barrel, but are still near two-year highs.U.S. shale producers have stressed capital spending discipline in their third-quarter results, but that doesn't mean production is stalling.Exxon Mobil (XOM) fell 0.3% to 83.47 on the stock market today. Chevron (CVX) sank 0.5%.

1147,ADS,"A British billionaire reportedly is considering buying a stake in Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA), prodding shares of the Israeli drugmaker to pop Monday despite a price-target cut following a lackluster quarter.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Teva jumped 8.9% to close at 12.41. Allergan (AGN) also sustained a price-target cut following its mixed report last week, and shares dipped 0.3% to close at 174.34.Len Blavatnik is looking to acquire up to a $3 billion stake in Teva, according to Reuters, which cited reports from Israeli outlets over the weekend. Teva has a $12.4 billion market cap. Shares hit a 17-year low last week after third-quarter earnings missed and Teva cut its 2017 guidance.Blavatnik could either acquire a stake in Teva through a private stock listing or by scooping up some of Allergan's 10% stake. Allergan received 10% of Teva as part of a deal last year in which it sold its generics business to Teva. Last week, Allergan said it was looking to sell that stake.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan trimmed his price target on Teva to 8 from 14, and kept his underperform rating. He expects the stock to continue to ""languish"" as investors await an updated strategic plan from new Chief Executive Kare Schultz.""Teva left a lot of questions unanswered on their conference call,"" Divan said in a note to clients.

Head to IBD Industry Themes for a breakdown on the industry group thus far in the third-quarter earnings season.Teva, the No. 2 maker of generic drugs, now finds itself on the flip side of the coin. Mylan (MYL) just launched a generic version of Copaxone, a multiple sclerosis drug from Teva. Now, Divan sees Teva pulling in $1.01 billion in U.S. Copaxone sales next year, down 71% year over year.""Mylan came to market immediately and at a price that was lower than Teva expected,"" he said.Questions also remain for Allergan, Divan said in a separate report. He cut his price target on Allergan to 224 from 243, though he kept his outperform rating. Like Teva, Allergan is soon to face generic competition for Restasis, an eye drug. It sees competition in either January or July 2018.""Our base case now assumes Restasis generic entry in the U.S. at the start of 2018, instead of mid-2018,"" he said. ""Our base 2018 EPS of $15.25 is down from our previous $16.55 in large part because of this change and what we assume would be a relatively rapid erosion in sales.""Generics could also pressure Namenda EX (extended release), Estrace, Delzicol and Aczone, drugs to treat dementia, a menopausal side effect, ulcerative colitis and a type of acne, respectively.Divan also lowered his estimate for Kybella, a drug to reduce fat under the chin, ""given the limited commercial progress that product has made.""

Among oil majors with holdings in Saudi Arabia, Exxon Mobil (XOM) rose 0.6% on the stock market today, Chevron (CVX) gained 1.8%, after falling out of buy range last week, BP (BP) rallied 2.1% and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) advanced 2.2%. BP and Shell are extended out of buy range.Even before the weekend's purge of top officials in Riyadh, prices had been trending higher. Here are five reasons why oil prices have been and may continue to be on the uptick:In an unprecedented move, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman ordered the arrests of several high-profile members of the royal family including billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal and Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah, the head of the Saudi Arabian National Guard.Salman has signaled support for OPEC's deal with Russia and other nonmembers to curb production and prop up prices. Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group, said in a note Monday that he expects Salman to continue to constrain production.But Salman's power consolidation also comes with some risks, especially as he seeks foreign investment to help fuel economic reforms.""The arrest of prince al-Waleed bin Talal, Saudi Arabia's richest businessman with a net worth of nearly $19 billion, could well dampen international interest in investing in the crown prince's much-heralded Vision 2030 to make the non-oil private sector the new motor of the economy,"" David Ottaway, Middle East Fellow at the Wilson Center, wrote in a note.Ramped-up regional tensions are adding upward pressure on prices, and Salman's stronger hand may also be factor on this front too, as he has been more hawkish on foreign policy.This weekend, Saudi Arabia claimed to have shot down a missile from Houthi rebels in Yemen near Riyadh. The kingdom is fighting a proxy war with Iran against the rebels in Yemen. Tehran is believed to have supplied the rebels with the missile, but Iran denies the allegations.The attack could be considered ""an act of war against the kingdom of Saudi Arabia,"" the Saudi-led military coalition said in a statement Monday.Analysts don't expect the power consolidation and increased tensions with Iran to affect the likely extension of the oil output deal. Last year, OPEC, Russia and other top producers agreed to curb production to remove 1.8 million barrels per day from the market to stabilize prices.Salman has been supportive of the deal as the country needs higher oil prices to hype up Saudi Aramco's initial public offering and Russian President Vladimir Putin has also shown signs of supporting an extension.The current production deal expires in March, but analysts expect an update at OPEC's biannual meeting at the end of this month.After looking for ways to expand production, shale producers are shifting their focus to cash-flow discipline and not working unprofitable plays, even as oil prices climb higher.Devon Energy (DVN), Cabot Oil & Gas (COG), EOG Resources (EOG) and other shale exploration and production companies showed spending discipline in their third-quarter results out last week.Meanwhile, U.S. rig counts have been falling and on Friday saw the biggest drop since May 2016, according to Baker Hughes (BHGE) data.Global demand for crude is rising, and the International Energy Agency said last month that global supply and demand will balance next year as demand growth rises 1.4% in 2018.Gasoline demand from China remains especially robust thanks to a 17% increase in SUV sales.

""In addition, (Alibaba Group's (BABA)) Alipay has been aggressively making investments outside of China.""Since it was spun off from eBay (EBAY) in 2015, PayPal has evolved from a payment button to a broad payments service provider, while expanding from online checkout to mobile payments.

1187,ADS,"Over the past six weeks, short sellers have been raising their bets that so-called ""FAANG"" stocks are due for a fall, according to a financial analytics firm.S3 Partners says growing short interest in what traditionally has been known as the FANG group — which includes four closely watched internet stocks: Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google — along with Apple (AAPL) indicates a bearish stance in those big-cap tech firms, which some collectively refer to as FAANG.""We're seeing a broad-based increase in short interest across the board,"" Brett Weiss, director of business development at S3 Partners, said Friday.Short selling involves the sale of a stock that has been borrowed by the seller. The seller believes that the stock's price will decline, enabling it to be bought back later at a lower price to make a profit.Bearish bets against the FAANGs have increased by 7.6% since mid-August, Weiss said. The total at risk in the short selling bets against those stocks is about $27.3 billion, S3 said.The largest increases in short investments have been in Facebook, Amazon and Netflix, S3 said.Short sellers have increased their positions in Netflix by $910.5 million since Aug. 15. They've upped their short positions in Facebook and Amazon by $494 million and $502 million, respectively.By contrast, they've lowered their short positions in Apple by $161.8 million over the past six weeks.Short sellers appear to be rotating out of Apple since its Sept. 12 fall product launch event, where it introduced the iPhone X and iPhone 8 series smartphones and the Apple Watch Series 3 smartwatch.Apple stock has fallen about 5% since the company's new product unveiling. Investors reacted negatively to the later-than-expected launch of the iPhone X, pronounced ""ten"" as in the Roman numeral, and concerns about short supply due to manufacturing issues.Why the increased short interest in Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google lately? It could be related to negative news hammering those big names, Weiss said.""There's a lot of news on every one of these stocks,"" he said. ""The FANGs are a popular sector.""Facebook, Amazon and Google have been the subject of potential antitrust enforcement to limit their dominance in online advertising and e-commerce.Facebook also has been dragged into the investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has acknowledged the social network ran some 3,000 politically themed advertisements that were bought by suspected Russian operatives. The disclosure could potentially lead to some government regulation on political ads and subject Facebook to more regulatory scrutiny.IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news on Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet, visit IBD's page on FANG stocks.Zuckerberg, meanwhile, revealed plans around Sept. 22 that he considered creating a new class of company stock with no voting power — but abandoned the idea. He also plans to sell a big chunk of his own shares.Netflix is facing the prospect of more Hollywood studios pulling their content off the Internet TV network, following recent moves by Walt Disney (DIS) and 21st Century Fox (FOXA). Disney and Fox plan to focus on their own subscription video-on-demand services that would compete with Netflix.While Apple is down 4.6% since Aug. 15, Netflix is up 7.6% in that period.

It has been forming a cup-with-handle base over the past 10 weeks with a buy point of 191.60.Netflix has mostly shaken off worries about losing traditional studio content because it has been aggressively ramping up production of original content, including hit shows like ""Stranger Things.""Netflix also is facing heightened competition from streaming rivals like Amazon Prime Video and Hulu.Facebook climbed 1.3% to 170.87 on Friday.

1188,ADS,"Buying stocks has never been easier, cheaper or more accessible, as new investment apps target millennials and beginning investors with deep interest in the stock market — but not-so-deep pockets.Robinhood promotes ""free stock trading."" Stash lets you ""start investing with just $5."" Acorns will ""invest spare change from every purchase."" And Stockpile offers ""your favorite stock by the dollar"" — so you can buy fractions of Alphabet (GOOGL) or Amazon.com (AMZN) shares, which are nearly a thousand dollars each.""Micro-investing apps have 'gameified' investing,"" said Lex Sokolin, fintech strategy director at Autonomous Research, in an interview. ""They are more about incentivizing participation in the financial markets — any participation by the younger generation — and making applications engaging and in some ways addictive.""The expansion of micro-investing apps will force the financial establishment to adapt — and could even disrupt traditional brokerages, say fintech and investing experts. But first these startups must show they can hang on to the customers they have acquired and turn a profit. That's no easy matter when incumbents such as Vanguard, Charles Schwab (SCHW), TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and E-Trade Financial (ETFC) have steadily lowered fees or removed minimums to trade stocks and ETFs, and have improved their digital platforms for a new generation of investors to boot.But in one early sign that these fintech startups are winning over established giants, as well as beginner investors, Stockpile said Thursday it has raised $30 million in its latest round of fundraising, led by a venture capital fund backed by global asset manager Fidelity International, bringing the total it's raised to more than $45 million.In just a few years of existence, micro-investing apps have built a core audience among millennial investors with not much in the way of investable assets.And the generation that came of age with the minimalist simplicity of Apple's iPhone doesn't want to look at screens overflowing with headlines, numbers and scrolling tickers.On Robinhood, which allows people to trade stocks for free and does away with investment minimums, there's no short interest data, analyst ratings or options information. The app is stripped of the bells and whistles found on TD Ameritrade or other fully featured brokerage apps, and doesn't even have ads that clutter the screen. Its design is carefully crafted to inspire — rather than overwhelm — the first-time investor, Robinhood says.Punch a stock ticker into the app, and you see little besides price action, a chart and a buy button. To buy the stock, enter the number of shares, preview the cost, swipe up — and you're done.""Interactions must be small, fun and easy"" for first-time investors, Sokolin said. ""Micro-investing apps nailed it better than online brokers or robo-advisors.""On Stash, you can build portfolios around investment themes like ""Clean And Green"" or ""American Innovators,"" rather than try to choose between less descriptive names like the T. Rowe Price Global Technology Fund or the Red Oak Technology Select Fund.Marie Thomasson, a 37-year-old financial planner in Los Angeles and self-described app junkie, recommends Stash to beginning investors.The app explains ""just what you need to know about investing and no more,"" she said, contrasting it to mainstream brokers' ""white papers"" that are dry, boring, outdated or overwhelming.The average age for Robinhood's 2 million users is 28, and a third of them use the app to make their first-ever stock purchase. If you think that's young, consider Stockpile: 60% of its user base is under 30 and 30% are children, who can get set up with custodial accounts.Stockpile has no account minimums and no monthly fees. And even a high-priced growth stock like Amazon can be bought for $25 or $50 or any dollar amount an investor chooses. Stockpile makes money in part by charging a flat fee of 99 cents a trade.For that amount, investors get fractional shares in the company and, often, their first taste of stock ownership, Stockpile CEO Avi Lele said in a phone call. The brokerage also offers gift cards that can be redeemed for stock, sold online and through outlets such as Target (TGT) and Safeway.But the stock ""gift card fee"" of $2.99 online ($4.95 and up in a store) — another way Stockpile makes money — has drawn flak as a hefty commission. Stockpile argues that it ensures the gift recipient gets the full stock-gift value.Lele said the app was inspired by his own struggles to scrape together a $5,000 minimum investment required by a brokerage firm. Lele was 25 before he had the money he needed to buy the Microsoft (MSFT) stock he badly wanted.""You can buy quality stocks even when you are starting out"" on Stockpile, he added. ""You can't do much with 50 bucks at a traditional brokerage.""And for those old enough to have credit cards, the Acorns app rounds up purchases to the nearest dollar and invests the change in ETF portfolios.University of Wisconsin student James Koenig, 22, estimates that his day-to-day spending nets him a $35-$50 investment every month.""Acorns is hands-down my favorite investing app,"" he said. ""I like the idea of being able to do small amounts that eventually add up to something bigger. You don't need to make a huge commitment.""There are trade-offs, of course. Robinhood, for example, offers fewer investment choices, less robust research tools, and a mobile-only trading platform. Micro-investing apps also get knocked for making stock trading much too easy.Acorns' and Stash's $1 monthly fees sound small, but could erase the yearly gains of a beginning investor who may have a couple hundred dollars or less in the apps, critics note. Jason Kirsch, a fee-only financial planner in California, argues that users have an incentive to overtrade, which can lead to huge losses, especially for novice investors.While apps such as Acorns offer some basic portfolio tracking, Kirsch finds that in more-complex situations — such as tracking individual securities for tax-loss harvesting — ""none of these apps has built-in software that makes this easy.""And Tastyworks, a new platform that enables self-directed investors to trade any investment strategy, be it stocks, options or futures, dings such apps for doing little to build either a robust technological platform or strategic know-how for investing in the stock market.""They may have captured a nice share of the business, but they may as well be selling hot dogs,"" sniffed Tastyworks co-founder Tom Sosnoff.Meanwhile, Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade and E-Trade have slashed trading commissions from $8-$10 per trade to $5-$7, narrowing the advantage that the new apps have on that score. And the incumbents have minimum balances that range from zero at TD Ameritrade to $1,000 at Schwab.In addition to questions about how much money the apps can make for their users, there is the question of how they can make money for themselves while charging nominal fees, or none at all in Robinhood's case.But in September of last year, the company launched Robinhood Gold, a premium product charging $6-$200 a month for added services like buying on margin and extended-hours trading. The service is attracting high-net-worth, active investors and becoming a major revenue driver, spokesman Jack Randall said, with some Robinhood accounts now running into millions of dollars. Robinhood also earns revenue by collecting interest on the cash and securities in user accounts.As for zero-fee trades, the company says it is able to offer this benefit because its all-electronic, tech-driven brokerage platform has slashed overhead costs. Randall dismisses trading fees as arbitrary markups with no place in the digital age, when ""executing a trade is the same as sending an email.""Robinhood is adding 140,000 accounts every month to its 2 million-strong user base, which has made $75 billion in transactions since the app's 2014 launch. But Randall could not say how many accounts are actually funded or used for trading and wouldn't share data on average account size or typical starting balance.The economics of micro-investing apps are extremely challenged, Sokolin acknowledged, while arguing that their true value lies in the opportunity to leverage the attention of audiences they have acquired.""They may offer automated savings, but then up-sell into financial planning, or provide financial literacy, or create video content and add lead-generation into other categories, or sell customer data to other parties,"" he said. ""There are lots of things you can do with a big audience other than getting them to buy funds.""Robinhood says its users check the app 10 times a day on average. That kind of engagement among a highly coveted demographic whose brand loyalties are still up for grabs could be made lucrative, for example, by monetizing users' data or up-selling premium services to them.Robinhood has won $176 million in venture capital funding since its 2012 launch and is now valued at $1.3 billion, PitchBook fintech analyst Evan Morris wrote in a recent report. Stash has raised more than $79 million since its October 2015 launch and has a $264 million valuation.

But as recent IPOs Snap (SNAP) and Roku (ROKU), as well as market leader Facebook (FB) show, investors are better off not buying new issues until they've proven themselves.MongoDB sold 8 million shares  at 24 a pop, raising $192 million.

1205,ADS,"The S&P 500 index, Nasdaq composite and Dow industrials are all near record highs. So where are the big winners?XApple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) sold off last week to drop below recent buy points, with Apple undercutting its 50-day moving average as well. Nvidia (NVDA) got off to a strong start, but has pared much of its gains. Meanwhile, many ""breakouts"" are like Alibaba (BABA), creeping into buy zones but just stalling or pulling back. All of that suggests that the risk-reward for investors isn't great.Using pattern recognition via IBD's Marketsmith, as of Friday there were 75 recent breakouts of stocks trading at least $15 million worth of shares a day, with current Composite Ratings of 90 or better. That doesn't include every breakout: Apple's Composite Rating was above 90 until its recent sell-off. Tesla now has a 77 CR, though that's in part due to a lack of profits. Citigroup (C) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) have decent but not great fundamental and technical readings. But still, this is a fairly large list to study.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, pay attention to the major averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases.Of those 75 recent breakouts, just 14 were more than 5% past the entry point as of Friday's closing bell, making them extended. Most are just out of range. The biggest winner is RV and towables maker Winnebago (WGO), with a 13.7% advance through Friday, taking on a further gain Monday morning. There are several auto parts firms in the mix. A few chip gear makers are the only tech representatives.Meanwhile, dozens are like Alibaba, SAP (SAP), Square (SQ), Amgen (AMGN) — nudging out to buy zones, stalling out and sometimes briefly undercutting their entry areas. Alibaba and Square fell in Monday morning trading to below its ascending base buy point.Some of these breakouts have come in light or lackluster volume, suggesting a lack of institutional support. Unless you bought right at or just above buy point, there's good chance you're down.Boeing (BA) and chipmaker Texas Instruments (TXN) are Sept. 15 breakouts that have advanced to near the high end of their 5% buy zones. Maybe Boeing and TI are on their way to be big gains.On the other hand, some stocks such as Nvidia and Universal Display (OLED), have made big initial moves but then pulled back.Nvidia broke out on Sept. 15. In the next session, the graphics and AI chipmaker rose as high as 9.5% above the buy point. But shares have fallen for the past four days, and are now just 2.5% over the entry.Universal Display, a maker of parts and tech for OLED screens as those next-generation displays are being used in high-end TVs, Samsung handsets and the upcoming Apple iPhone X, was 13.6% above its double-bottom entry Tuesday intraday. But thanks to three days of selling, Universal Display is now just 3.8% over the buy point. You don't want to see a 10%-plus winner roundtrip to the buy point.Nvidia and Universal Display fell more than 2% shortly in Monday morning trade, with both stocks undercutting their recent buy points.Meanwhile, 17 of the 75 recent breakouts were below their buy points as of Friday. Some are just below their entries. But Proofpoint (PFPT), MGM Resorts (MGM) and Apple iPhone chipmaker Skyworks (SWKS) fell so far that those buy points are now invalid.Because of the current 90+ Composite Rating screen, the number of underwater or failed breakouts may be higher. Apple and Tesla are definitely below their buy points but technically not quite failed breakouts, though Apple's above-average volume tumble through its 10-week line gave an additional reason for investors to cut losses. Apple fell 0.8% Monday morning while Tesla rose 0.5%.Oracle (ORCL), with its heavy-volume plunge below its buy point and 50-day line after issuing weak guidance, is a failed breakout.If the market picks up, with even a modest uptrend, you might see stocks that are hovering at or above buy points take off. On the other hand, a market slide, even modest, would likely push many more breakouts underwater.Investors need to recognize the current landscape, despite the market direction being ""confirmed uptrend."" There are stocks that are working, but big winners are scarce. Pay close attention to your portfolio as well as the major averages and leading stocks.RELATED:The Big Picture: Small Caps Up; Apple's Stock TumblesNvidia Stock Shaken On Report Tesla Is Developing Chips With AMDFacebook Stock Is At A Make-Or-Break Moment; Here's WhyThis Defense Giant Just Broke Out; These 2 Rivals Are Near BuysHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

1207,ADS,"Saudi Arabia is reportedly drawing interest from China, Russia, South Korea and Japan for private sales of shares in its state-run oil company, amid reports Aramco's international IPO could be shelved.XAnalysts originally expected an IPO to generate $100 billion in proceeds, dwarfing Alibaba's (BABA) record $25 billion in 2014, while also valuing the company at more than $2 trillion, which is more than double current leader Apple's (AAPL) $800 billion-plus market cap and eight times Exxon Mobil's (XOM) valuation.But on Friday, the Financial Times reported that the company was considering a series of private sales to wealth funds, institutional investors and foreign governments. But Aramco denied the reports, saying the IPO plans are still on track for next year.China's PetroChina and Sinopec have expressed interest in a direct deal with Saudi Aramco to buy 5% of the company, Reuters reported Monday, as part of a consortium that would also include China's sovereign wealth fund.""The Chinese want to secure oil supplies,"" one of the sources told Reuters. ""They are willing to take the whole 5%, or even more, alone.""Sovereign wealth funds from South Korea, Japan and Russia are also reportedly interested in investing in Aramco's IPO.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.In 2016, Riyadh announced plans to sell up to 5% of Aramco to help raise capital as the country looks to diversify its economy and rely less on oil.But the IPO is looking more doubtful amid debates over when and where Saudi Aramco could list shares as well as persistently low oil prices.Even if a private offering happens, shares could still be listed in Saudi Arabia's Tadawul exchange next year, and a possible international IPO could follow in 2019 at the earliest, according to the FT last week.RELATED: Crude Futures Rise As Iraqi, Kurdish Forces Clash In Oil-Rich KirkukEnergy Stocks And Industry NewsBest Chinese Stocks To Buy And Watch

1208,ADS,"Allergan (AGN) stock tanked Monday after a federal judge invalidated patents covering eye-drug Restasis, in a dispute pitting Allergan against a group of generic drugmakers led by Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Mylan (MYL).XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Allergan toppled 3.5% to finish at 198.41. Teva fell 1.8% to close at 14.71, as Mylan lifted a fraction to end the regular trading session at 38.18.Judge William Bryson said the ideas covered by the Restasis patents were too obvious to protect, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat wrote in a note to clients. Bryson tended to agree with Allergan that there would be a case for infringement if the patents were held to be valid.Allergan pledged in a news release to appeal the decision. The ruling invalidates four patents on Restasis. To date, none of the proposed generic versions of Restasis have received approval and none are able to launch in the market, the firm noted.""Allergan remains committed to vigorously defending the intellectual property of our products, which allows us to continue to invest in developing and bringing forward new medicines for millions of patients,"" Chief Legal Officer Robert Bailey said in a statement.IBD'S TAKE: Allergan has an IBD Composite Rating of 52, meaning it outperforms just over half of all stocks tracked in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of better-performing drugmakers.This followed Allergan's move last month to transfer the rights to these patents to the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe — a legal play that's been called creative and controversial as it takes advantage of the Native American tribe's sovereign status.Bryson had ""serious concerns about the legitimacy of the tactic,"" Raffat said.""Allergan purports to have sold the patents to the tribe, but in reality it has paid the tribe to allow Allergan to purchase — or perhaps more precisely, to rent — the tribe's sovereign immunity,"" he said. If successful, this method could give patent defendants a new method of defeating challenges.Raffat expects a final decision based on Allergan's appeal late into 2018. He suggests that Allergan could seek an injunction against rival generics.RELATED:Why Allergan's Hepatitis Drug Likely Won't Get FDA ApprovalGeneric Drug Makers Face Pricing Issues That Other Pharmas Don'tTeva And Mylan Under Pressure As Rivalries Loom For Key Drugs

Apple (AAPL) and JPMorgan (JPM) led the half-dozen blue chips striding to powerful gains during the session.XThe Dow Jones industrial average ended 0.4% higher to end just a fraction below the 23,000 mark; it just passed 22,000 in mid-September. The Nasdaq chalked up a 0.3% gain, and the S&P 500 added 0.2%, each knocking off new highs of their own.The session opened on positive footing after much stronger-than-expected producer price data out of China and a forecast from a central bank governor for the economy's growth to hit 7% in the second half of the year. Another boost before the starting bell came from the New York Federal Reserve, which reported its Empire State Manufacturing Survey spiking to 30.2 for October, up from 24.4 for September and trouncing outlooks for a decline.The combination, along with a positive tone headed into the earnings reporting season, left Six Dow industrials names with gains of better than 1%. JPMorgan (JPM) clocked out with a 2% advance, and Goldman Sachs (GS) rose 1.5% ahead of its third quarter report, due out Tuesday morning.Apple rumbled ahead 1.8%, after its recent move to a segmented revenue strategy earned it an upgrade, to overweight, from equal weight, from Keybanc. The price target held steady at 187. The gain put Apple shares back above their 10-week moving average as the stock continues to build the right side of a new base pattern. The stock also remains in a technical buy range above a 156.75 buy point from a prior base pattern.Travelers (TRV) swung up 1.7% as the insurance sector in general booked a strong session.

1210,ADS,"Allergan (AGN) was already facing a ""public relations backlash"" after transferring patent rights for its Restasis eye medication to a Native American tribe, when a judge on Monday then invalidated four of those patents.XNow, Allergan faces an uphill battle in regaining credibility on Wall Street, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan wrote in a note to clients. He cut his price target on Allergan to 243 from 266, but kept his outperform rating.""We generally have been fans of the Allergan management team, but find it challenging to defend the steps that were taken with the patent agreement,"" he wrote in a note to clients. ""We believe it will take some time for the management team to regain the credibility it has lost through this process.""The process involved transferring the rights to its Restasis patents to the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe in September to avoid a patent challenge. As a Native American tribe, St. Regis Mohawk has sovereign immunity. But the play has been called both creative as well as controversial.On Monday, a judge invalidated four patents covering Restasis. Judge William Bryson said the ideas covered by the patents were too obvious to protect. He also expressed serious concerns regarding the legitimacy of the transfer to St. Regis Mohawk.IBD'S TAKE: Allergan has an IBD Composite Rating of 54 out of a best-possible 99. It lags top players like AbbVie with a CR of 98, meaning it performs in the top 2% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at other high-ranking drug stocks.Even before Monday, Allergan stock had lost 12% of its value following the agreement, Divan wrote. The loss in district court also does nothing to ""erase the public-relations backlash the company has suffered from going through with the agreement in the first place.""Combined with a push by the Food and Drug Administration to approve generic drugs at a faster clip, Divan assumes a generic launch of a Restasis drug by mid-2018, up from his earlier view for 2022. Mylan (MYL) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) are among those working on generic versions of the drug.For longer-term investors, Divan sees 198 as an attractive entry point to the stock. In the short term, catalysts include third-quarter earnings on Nov. 1 and the potential for a guidance update with and without generic Restasis competition.""If guidance is not provided on the Nov. 1 call (at least at a high level), investors will likely have to wait until the January time frame for the company's 2018 guidance,"" Divan said.Data readouts include a late-stage trial in treating acute migraines and a midstage trial of a drug to prevent migraines in the first half of 2018. Both belong to a class of drugs called anti-CGRPs. Teva, Amgen (AMGN), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) are also working in this arena.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Allergan slipped 0.3% to close at 197.78, after ending Monday trades down 3.5%.RELATED:Allergan Tanks After Judge Invalidates Restasis PatentsWhy Allergan's Hepatitis Drug Likely Won't Get FDA ApprovalGeneric Drug Makers Face Pricing Issues That Other Pharmas Don't

Over the prior 50 sessions, an average 5.1 million shares exchanged hands each day.The Dow Jones industrial average edged nearly 0.2% higher, while the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 were virtually flat. Volume is running lighter vs. the same time Monday on the NYSE and is a touch higher on the Nasdaq.The Nasdaq remains the market's leading index, up 23%, vs. a 14.3% gain for the 500 and a 16.4% lift for the Dow Jones industrials.The Russell 2000 fell 0.3%. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond inched up to 2.31%. Crude oil bounced off intraday lows and edged higher, with WTI futures rising almost 0.2% to $51.96 a barrel.The Dow Jones industrial average component J&J posted a 13% increase in earnings to $1.90 a share, matching the biggest gain in 12 quarters, as revenue growth accelerated (up 10% to $19.65 billion). The pharmaceutical, medical product and personal care giant had grown sales by 2% to 4% in each of the prior five quarters.J&J's saucer base could also be viewed as a long flat base as well. Either way, the buy point is the same, 10 cents above the base's left-side high.J&J's 61 Relative Price Strength Rating, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, may seem low on a scale of 1 (very weak) to 99 (super strong), yet for long saucer base patterns, such an RS Rating is actually par for the course.Also, watch the stock's relative strength line, painted in blue on IBD and MarketSmith charts; an RS line that rises into new high ground helps confirm a stock's ability to outperform the S&P 500 and become a new market leader.Also, within J&J's saucer pattern, the heaviest weekly volume came during the week ended Sept. 15, when the megacap health care play rallied nearly 2.7% for the week. Big gains in heavy weekly turnover point to strong institutional demand.(Read more about the elements of a great saucer base via this Investor's Corner column written by my colleague Paul Whitfield.)J&J has a market value of $377 billion.The company's after-tax margin improved by 20 basis points to an impressive 26.5%. Guggenheim Securities analyst Tony Butler told Reuters that J&J's oncology business ""is doing exceptionally well. It's really hard to figure out where that stops for both Darzalex and Imbruvica."" Both are used to treat cancer, the former for multiple myeloma, the latter for use in chemotherapy.UnitedHealth notched a fifth quarter in a row of 20%-plus EPS growth as earnings rose 23% to $2.66 a share. Revenue grew 9%, stretching a high single-digit pace for a fourth straight quarter.Elsewhere on the stock market today, Apple (AAPL) gained an additional 0.4% to 160.47 in dull volume. On Monday, shares boosted back above a 156.75 buy point in an 11-week flat base that was cleared Aug. 2. The 5% chase zone goes up to 164.59.Apple also is now back above the 50-day moving average, a bullish sign for techs and the major indexes.Since late 2016, investors have been warming up to Apple after the iPhone giant proved it can still grow.Earnings had fallen 18%, 23% and 15% in the three quarters through fiscal 2016, ended in September that year. But in the three most recent periods, Apple grew its profit 2%, 11% and 18%, and Wall Street sees Q4 profit rising 12% to $1.87 a share.Revenue is seen climbing 9% to $50.9 billion, then rising 10% to $85.91 billion in the holiday quarter ending in December.Apple has gained more than 39% since clearing a superb first-stage cup with handle, part of a long bottoming-base pattern, at 118.12 on Jan. 6-9. As seen in Stock Checkup, Apple's ratings have improved markedly as a turnaround play since the start of the year.Meanwhile, among newer issues, Azul (AZUL) (April 11 IPO) and Bright Scholar Education (BEDU) (May 18 IPO) deserve close watch as potential new market leaders.Azul, the Brazilian airline, dropped for a third straight session but shaved its loss to a measly 0.2%.

The firm grew its revenue 34% to a record $159 million in 2016. In the May-ended fiscal third quarter, revenue jumped 24% to $60 million, a quarterly high.Wall Street expects earnings of 2 cents  a share in the fiscal fourth quarter ended in August, vs. a net loss of a penny a share in the year-ago quarter.Then, in the November-ending fiscal first quarter of 2018, profit is seen leaping 150% to 20 cents a share.

1219,ADS,"Ascendis Pharma (ASND) grabbed bullish views and rocketed to a record high Friday after rival Versartis (VSAR) crashed upon reporting its pediatric growth hormone deficiency drug failed in a late-stage trial.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Ascendis had gapped up 23.4% to finish at 34.24 after earlier touching an all-time high, up 51%, at 42. Shares broke out of a consolidation and a 31.96 buy point in heavy volume. Versartis, though, plummeted 87.6% to close at 2.68.Late Thursday, Versartis said its drug somavaratan failed to meet its goal in a Phase 3 study of pediatric patients with growth hormone deficiencies. Now, analysts expect Ascendis to grab the lion's share of the market if its Phase 3 drug wins approval.Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young boosted her price target on Ascendis to 50 from 30. She sees Ascendis getting 30%-50% of the global market, up from her earlier view for a 20%-30% share.She models Ascendis' drug, dubbed TransCon growth hormone, hitting $1.2 billion in peak sales, up from her previous forecast for $820 million. The daily growth hormone market is worth $3.2 billion and could rise to $4.5 billion as the market moves to long-acting drugs.IBD'S TAKE: Among big biotech players, Vertex Pharmaceuticals says it's closing in on the end of its cystic fibrosis journey. So what's next for this top-performer? Head to The New America for an exclusive interview with Chief Executive Jeffrey Leiden.Enrollment in a Phase 3 trial of TransCon growth hormone is expected to be complete in the fourth quarter. Young expects Ascendis to offer data from the trial in late 2018. If the drug is 100% successful, her price target could lift as high as 66.Young sees an 80% chance of Ascendis getting approval for the drug.But Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz kept his market perform rating on Ascendis while awaiting Phase 3 data and noted the risks associated with commercialization. He upped his price target to 37 from 28.Ascendis expects to get 40%-50% market share in the growth hormone deficiency market. Schwartz assumes peak penetrations of 51% and 46% in the U.S. and Europe in 2028-29 for Ascendis' drug, up from his earlier forecast for 40% and 36%, respectively.Still, ""We view 50% market share as an aggressive hurdle that may factor in other bullish assumptions including commercial execution and no other companies succeeding in the clinic with a long-acting growth hormone,"" he said.The firm has a high bar for its Phase 3 data and is going up against the likes of Pfizer (PFE) and Novo Nordisk (NVO). Most specialists say the U.S. market generally favors an aggressive approach to achieve better growth.In a Phase 2 study, annualized growth for pediatric patients treated with TransCon growth hormone was 11.9-13.9 centimeters on two different weekly doses, which was comparable to the 11.6 centimeters for patients treated daily with Pfizer's Genotropin.""That said, there is risk that the result regresses in Phase 3, and it is difficult to pinpoint the market-share implications of such differences in (growth) outcomes,"" Schwartz said.RELATED:Human Growth Drug Flop Sends This Biotech Crashing 83%Alnylam Is Entering 'New Chapter,' But Ionis Still Has A ChanceWhy September Will Be A 'Make Or Break' Month For These Biotechs

1225,ADS,"Democrats and some Republicans in Congress are pushing for a $10 billion a year payout to insurance companies that sell Obamacare plans.  President Trump calls it ""bailing out"" the insurance industry. Truer words were never spoken.The politicians backing this sweetheart deal  claim it will protect consumers. Don't fall for it.  The money will go straight to the bottom lines of insurers — who enjoy tremendous clout in Washington D.C.,  thanks to over $85 million in campaign contributions and over $150 million spent on lobbying every year.The deal's authors — Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. — have taken hundreds of thousands in insurance contributions personally and through their PACs.  No surprise the deal  gives insurers everything they want: an estimated $10 billion a year cash plus $100 million in Obamacare ads. No other industry gets taxpayers to pay for their advertising. Meanwhile, consumers get nothing: no freedom to buy affordable plans without Washington-mandated benefits,  no escape from onerous tax penalties for not enrolling.In 2010, the powerful insurance industry worked hand in glove with Democrats to enact the Affordable Care Act, a  scheme compelling everyone  to buy their product.  The ACA  also steered tens of billions of dollars in backdoor payments to insurers through 2016 to insulate them from losing their shirts on Obamacare.  It doesn't get any sweeter — a law making your product mandatory and forcing taxpayers to subsidize your bottom line.The current $10 billion tug-of-war is more of the same — the Washington swamp exploiting the public.  Insurers are fighting for more taxpayer largesse — and too many members of Congress are lining up to accommodate. But not President Trump.  In the Rose Garden this week, Trump quipped that insurers ""contribute massive amounts of money to political people. … Me, I'm not interested in their money.""The ACA requires insurers selling Obamacare plans to give low-income consumers a break on deductibles and copays.  Insurers claim they lose money doing that, and want taxpayers to make up the shortfall.  But Congress never voted for those payments, despite providing many others to the industry.No problem, under President Obama.  He paid the insurers without getting Congress's consent. But the U.S. Constitution says the president can't spend what Congress doesn't appropriate. The House of Representatives sued, and Obama lost. Federal judge Rosemary Collyer ruled the payments illegal.Fast forward to October 12, when Trump announced he would halt  the  payments. Democrats howled that Trump was sabotaging the health law. Sen. Chris Murphy, D. Conn., accused the president of ""health care arson,"" an inflammatory statement and untrue.Trump's decision lobs the issue back to Congress, where it belongs.  But tragically  that's where insurers have more sway than taxpayers.Denying it's a ""bailout,"" Alexander claims ""we have strong language in the Alexander-Murray agreement that consumers get the money, not the insurance companies.""  Those are weasel words.  In truth, low income consumers are already guaranteed breaks on co-pays and deductibles under the ACA. This agreement gives them nothing extra. The money is paid directly to insurers, going straight to profits.California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, one of 19 AGs trying to circumvent Judge Collyer's ruling  by suing  in the left leaning Ninth Circuit, claims that  without the payments, millions of families ""would be left in the cold without coverage.""  Nonsense. The law guarantees low-income  families insurance. What it does not do is guarantee insurers a profit.As for threats that without the payments, insurer will hike premiums, hurting consumers — don't buy that. State regulators have the final say on premiums.Of course, bailing out insurers will keep them participating in Obamacare,  propping up the  failing system.  That's the Democrats' goal, to preserve Obama's legacy.

1231,ADS,"Scandalmongering: Over the weekend, CNN offered up a shocking revelation: Russia had enlisted Pikachu and his Pokemon pals in its effort to get Donald Trump elected president. Well, not really. It was just the latest nonstory whipped up by the Trump-hating press.Here's the headline CNN put on its ""exclusive"" story: ""Even Pokemon Go used by extensive Russian-linked meddling effort.""It begins: ""Russian efforts to meddle in American politics did not end at Facebook and Twitter. A CNN investigation of a Russian-linked account shows its tentacles extended to YouTube, Tumblr and even Pokemon Go.""By ""meddle,"" of course, they mean ""helped elect Trump president.""It turns out none of this had anything to do with electing Trump.In this case, the Russians apparently developed a campaign — called ""Don't Shoot Me"" — that was designed to ""exploit racial tensions and sow discord among Americans.""The YouTube page contained news reports, amateur footage and the like that the Black Lives Matter crowd were parading all over the web.If that constitutes ""meddling"" in the election, then Black Lives Matter, Hillary Clinton and the mainstream press are guiltier than these Kremlin trolls. They ceaselessly pushed the racist police story because they thought it would help energize the Democratic base.So what was Russia's intent? ""It's unclear,"" is all CNN could muster.That story followed on the heels of another CNN ""exclusive"" about how ""Russian-linked Facebook ads targeted Michigan and Wisconsin.""This story began: ""A number of Russian-linked Facebook ads specifically targeted Michigan and Wisconsin, two states crucial to Donald Trump's victory last November, according to four sources with direct knowledge of the situation.""It went on: ""Some of the Russian ads appeared highly sophisticated in their targeting of key demographic groups in areas of the states that turned out to be pivotal.""Had CNN finally found evidence that Russia tried, and might have succeeded, in swinging the election for Trump?Hardly.It was up to the Washington Examiner's Byron York to provide the relevant facts and context.He found that of the 3,000 Russian ads that Facebook turned over to Congress, most of them ran after the election and so could hardly be part of any ""meddling."" The vast majority didn't mention the election or any candidate. A quarter of them weren't seen by anybody.What's more, out of those 3,000 ads, only a tiny handful targeted Michigan and Wisconsin, nearly all of them ran in 2015 — well before Trump was nominated — and most had fewer than 1,000 impressions.In other words, there was nothing to justify CNN's treatment of the story.In between these two breathless nonstories, the infamous ""smoking gun"" meeting between Donald Trump Jr and a Russian lawyer is turning out to be another nothingburger.Newly released emails showed that the meeting was entirely focused on U.S. sanctions and adoption rules involving Russia, and had nothing to do with dishing dirt on Hillary Clinton.What about that promise of a meeting in a separate email from British publicist Rob Goldstone, who said the Russian lawyer had damaging evidence on Clinton? It's likely that was a way to lure Trump people to a meeting they'd otherwise not bother with.For nearly a year now, we've seen this same pattern. A headline-grabbing story about Russia ""meddling"" and Trump ""collusion"" that ends up fizzling out when the facts come in.If Russia's motivation in all of this wasn't to elect Trump, but to sow discord and hostility within the U.S. — which increasingly looks like the point — then Russia's leaders succeeded beyond their wildest imagination. And for that, they have the liberal media, not their own efforts, to thank.XRELATED:Is Any Part Of The Russia Election Hacking Story True?Obama White House Spied On Trump And Lied About ItNow Hillary Wants To Challenge The Election?

1234,ADS,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Galapagos (GLPG) stocks diverged Friday as one analyst suggested that while Galapagos has an interesting molecular formula, it may not have a viable cystic fibrosis drug on its hands.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Vertex popped 3.5% to finish at 149.97, as Galapagos fell 2.7%, to close at 97.09. The biotechs made presentations Friday during the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference in Indianapolis.""Galapagos has well-researched molecules that have intriguing activity in a variety of laboratory systems and molecular models for cystic fibrosis, but so far it is difficult to know if these molecules will actually make viable drugs,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients.Both biotechs are working on triple-pill combinations to treat the genetic lung condition. Analysts mostly estimate Galapagos is several years behind Vertex, which already has four potential triple-pill combinations in midstage testing.To catch up, Galapagos appears to be compressing and ""attempting to outright skip over"" many of the traditional aspects of clinical testing. That has raised some questions for investors, Porges said.""Given their lack of progress with their combinations in the U.S., we don't foresee the sort of rapid development timeline for Galapagos' combinations in the U.S. that they are proposing and planning for Europe,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: At one point, Vertex looked like it was going to go bust as it worked to pivot to cystic fibrosis after its hepatitis C drug tanked. Visit The New America for more on Vertex's transition and what's next.During its presentation, Galapagos indicated it plans to introduce molecules via single-drug and add-on studies first, and then advance into novel triple-combination trials very rapidly, Porges said. The goal is seemingly to avoid traditional Phase 2 trials.But the Food and Drug Administration hasn't endorsed that strategy.""This means that all the current and soon-to-start trials of the Galapagos combinations will be conducted only in Europe,"" he said.Still, Galapagos is aiming to advance their combination to Phase 3 testing in 2019. AbbVie (ABBV) acquired the rights to Galapagos' cystic fibrosis combination program in 2013. Under the terms of the deal, AbbVie has to fund and execute the Phase 3 trials.AbbVie would likely prefer a more traditional and complete path to expensive Phase 3 testing, he said. Before that, AbbVie will have to decide whether to opt in or out of the deal.""Should AbbVie discontinue, or delay a decision about going forward, this would be viewed negatively for Galapagos and positively for Vertex,"" he said. ""Such a decision doesn't seem imminent, which is fortunate for Galapagos, but will make for challenging times for Galapagos if AbbVie opts out, or doesn't advance any of the combinations.""Porges has an outperform rating and 179 price target on Vertex stock.RELATED:Three Biotech Firms Top Third-Quarter Views — But Only One PopsIonis Rebounds After Beating Alnylam To Drug Application In EuropeNeurocrine, Exelixis, Juno Stocks Rocket After Crushing Views

1242,ADS,"In the wake of a weak earnings report, Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) has a ""long road ahead"" as rival Mylan (MYL) prepares to launch a copycat of Teva's Copaxone drug and the U.S. generics environment worsens, an analyst said Thursday.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Teva dove to a 17-year low with shares collapsing 19.9% to finish at 11.23, though earlier they crashed as much as 22.6%. The stock hit its lowest point this decade, touching a low it last saw in May 2000.For the quarter, Teva reported $5.61 billion in sales, up 1%, in line with the consensus. But adjusted earnings of $1 per share lagged the average view of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $1.03 and toppled 20% year over year.The biggest source of pain came from Teva's generics unit which plunged 8% to $3 billion. In the U.S., generic drug sales fell 9%. European sales increased 6% to $985 million. Sales for the remainder of the world declined 18%, while over-the-counter sales decreased 22%.President Donald Trump has said he'd like to install a competitive system to bring down drug prices. To that end, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has pledged to speed generic approvals and lower drug costs.IBD'S TAKE: Teva isn't the only drugmaker that struggled in the third quarter. Dow's Pfizer fell to a seven-week low as several drugs in its legacy medicines unit lost market exclusivity. Head to The Income Investor for more on what befell Pfizer in the quarter.Teva acknowledged the decline in the U.S. was ""mainly due to challenging market dynamics including pricing declines resulting from customer consolidation into larger buying groups and accelerated FDA approvals for generic versions of competing off-patent medicines.""Specialty medicines also declined 1% to $2 billion. In the U.S., sales fell 4% to $1.5 billion, partially offset by increases of 10% and 12% in Europe and the rest of the world, respectively. The unit brought in 36% of total sales for the quarter, Teva said in a news release.The biggest declines for Teva were from its Azilect, a Parkinson's disease drug, and Copaxone, a multiple sclerosis medication. Azilect toppled 64% to $36 million and Copaxone, Teva's largest moneymaker, plunged 7% to $987 million after the FDA approved generic versions of the drug.Respiratory drugs climbed a collective 30% to $351 million as sales of oncology drugs inched up 12% to $302 million.Teva cut forecasts, citing earlier generic competition for multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone. Teva now sees 2017 adjusted profit of $3.77-$3.87 per share vs. prior guidance of $4.30-4.50. Full-year revenue will be $22.2 billion-$22.3 billion, compared with previous guidance of $22.8 billion-$23.2 billion.Analysts had previously called for adjusted income of $4.11 on $22.69 billion in sales.For the fourth quarter, the new 2017 guidance implies sales of $5.3 billion to $5.4 billion and 70-80 cents adjusted earnings per share.

1258,ADS,"While many Wall Street analysts predict Apple's (AAPL) upcoming iPhone X will kick off a ""supercycle"" of upgrade activity, others aren't convinced.Richard Windsor, an analyst with Edison Investment Research, is among the skeptics. In a report Tuesday, he said the iPhone X is unlikely to produce the supercycle needed to support Apple's current stock price.Apple stock inched up 6 cents to close at 155.90 on the stock market today.""Expectations for the iPhone X are at fever pitch and a supercycle is now required to prevent a sell-off in the shares,"" Windsor said. He doesn't see that happening because the iPhone X just isn't that dramatically different from its predecessors.The iPhone X, pronounced 10 as in the Roman numeral, features a 5.8-inch OLED display and a facial-recognition security feature. It is scheduled to go on sale starting Nov. 3.""We do not think the iPhone X will stimulate a big enough uptick in replacement rates to meet the expectation that Apple will ship more than 255 million units in its next fiscal year,"" Windsor said. He predicts that Apple will ship, at most, 245 million units in the next fiscal year.The utility of the iPhone X is similar to last year's iPhone 7 handsets, but with a starting price of $999 it is much more expensive, he said.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has been forming a new base over the past six weeks with a buy point of 165.04.""We think expectations for fiscal 2018 need to come back somewhat, which is likely to trigger a sell-off in the shares, bringing the valuation down somewhat,"" Windsor said. ""Hence, the time is right to take some money off the table and put it somewhere else.""Among big techs, Windsor prefers Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), Baidu (BIDU) and Microsoft (MSFT), which have less immediate downside than Apple, he said.RELATED:This Could Push Apple To $1 Trillion Market Cap, Analyst Says

Production rose 6% to 276,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which includes a 10% increase in oil production to 162,000 barrels a day.The company sees Q4 production of 292,000-302,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and boosted its 2017 capital budget forecast to $2.75 billion from a prior view of $2.7 billion.Over the summer, Pioneer lowed its outlook of how many higher-value oil barrels it would produce in 2017. But at the Oil & Money conference last month, Pioneer said it plans to quadruple production over the next decade thanks to increasing output from Texas.On Wednesday, Pioneer said this 10-year production plan would help keep its spending within cash flow by 2020 at an oil price of $50 per barrel.Laredo Petroleum (LPI) earned 13 cents a share, missing Zacks views by a penny, as revenue jumped 29% to $205.8 million, easily beating views for $183 million. Production increased 17% to 60,011 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and management sees Q4 production ramping up to 61,000-64,000.Laredo increased its 2017 capital budget to $630 million from the previously anticipated $530 million, due to service cost inflation, additional completion optimization testing and data collection.""The efficiencies driven by these investments, coupled with a disciplined capital program, are expected to result in a double-digit oil production growth rate over the next two years, while operating within cash flow by the end of 2019 and enhancing the Company's return on average capital employed,"" said Chairman and CEO Randy Foutch in a statement.Earlier Wednesday, oil prices reversed lower after government data showed U.S. production surged to near-record highs.The Energy Information Administration said domestic production rose to 9.55 million barrels per day (bpd) last week from 9.5 million in the previous week, closing in on the record high of 9.61 million bpd reached in June 2015. Crude stockpiles fell by 2.4 million barrels from the prior week. Gasoline inventories decreased by 4 million barrels. Analysts were expecting a 1.8 million-barrel decline in crude and 1.5 million-barrel drop in gasoline.Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said stockpiles fell by 5.1 million barrels for the week ended Oct. 27, with gasoline stockpiles down by 7.7 million barrels.U.S. crude settled down 0.2% at $54.30 a barrel, and Brent dropped 0.7% to $60.49, after both rose more than 1% earlier.Shares of Pioneer dipped 0.6% in late trading, after closing 2.9% higher at 153.97 on the stock market today. Laredo finished up 2.2% at 12.18.IBD'S TAKE: As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important. The chart action of these top stocks offers an answer.Prices had some upward momentum earlier in the day on a Reuters survey that showed OPEC production fell by 80,000 barrels per day to 32.78 million, led by a drop in output from the Kurdish region of northern Iraq.The oil group's compliance with a deal to remove 1.8 million barrels of production from global markets was at 92%, up from 86% in September. The rising compliance seems to indicate that OPEC and Russia will support extending the output deal when they meet on Nov. 30.Nigerian output fell by 70,000 bpd last month, according to the survey, while Libya increased production by 70,000 bpd. Both are exempt from the current output deal.RELATED: Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, CoalExxon To Boost Spending, Add Rigs To Permian; Chevron Cuts Capex ViewShale Earnings: Concho Resources, Devon Energy Beat, Anadarko Misses

1264,ADS,"Mylan (MYL) and company President Rajiv Malik were among those named in a sweeping lawsuit Tuesday, in which 46 state attorneys general expanded a complaint charging 18 drugmakers with what prosecutors called a ""mind-blowing"" scheme to fix generic drug prices.XThe newly expanded complaint alleges that the drugmakers colluded to fix the prices of pharmaceuticals by communicating at trade shows, conferences and other events, as well as through email, phone and text messages.All together, the 18 companies worked together to falsely inflate the prices of 15 drugs to treat glaucoma, arthritis, high blood pressure, diabetes, anxiety and asthma as well as several other conditions, the attorneys general allege.""We allege in this complaint that the defendant companies' collusion was so pervasive that it essentially eliminated competition from the market for these 15 drugs in its entirety,"" Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen said in a prepared statement.Jepsen, who is leading the charge, described the conspiracies alleged as ""mind-blowing.""Mylan says it stands by Malik and has ""found no evidence of price fixing on the part of Mylan or its employees."" Mylan said it's still waiting for the attorneys general to share the information intended to substantiate the new allegations.""Mylan has deep faith in the integrity of its president, Rajiv Malik, and stands behind him fully,"" the firm said in a prepared statement. ""Mylan and Rajiv Malik both intend to defend this case vigorously, and we look forward to the opportunity to present a full defense.""IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks have largely had mixed reports this quarter, though Celgene's sales miss on lower-than-expected sales of Otezla caused the stock to slide hard. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at earnings season thus far.In 2015, generic drug sales in the U.S. were estimated at $74.5 billion and, today, the generic drug industry accounts for about 88% of all prescriptions written in the U.S.Along with Mylan, the lawsuit also includes generic giant Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA). The new complaint added Actavis Pharma — acquired by Teva from Allergan (AGN) — Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) and Novartis' (NVS) Sandoz unit.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Mylan toppled 6.6%, near 35.10, as the broad generic drugs group plunged a collective 1.7%. Another generic firm named in the complaint, Lannett (LCI), led the downward slide, falling 13.7% to close at 19.90.Along with Mylan's Malik, Satish Mehta, chief executive and managing director of privately held Emcure Pharmaceuticals, the parent company of Heritage Pharmaceuticals, was the other individual named in the complaint.Earlier this year, two former Heritage executives admitted to a price-fixing scheme between April 2013 and December 2015 involving a generic antibiotic and a diabetes drug. Heritage was among six drugmakers named in the initial lawsuit in late 2016.Evercore analyst Umer Raffat expects a series of settlements. He had originally expected Teva to pay $300 million to $700 million in damages if it ultimately settles and Mylan to pay $380 million to $770 million.RELATED:Generic Drugmakers Crash After Perrigo Searched In Antitrust ProbeCelgene CEO: Drug-Pricing Debate Hinges On Incentives For InnovationDOJ Charges Pharma Execs With Price-Fixing; Teva, Mylan Stocks Fall

1265,ADS,"Incyte (INCY) popped early Tuesday on better-than-expected sales for the third quarter and after it announced an expanded collaboration with AstraZeneca (AZN) that could broaden its opportunity for immuno-oncology drug epacadostat.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Incyte was down 0.9% to 113.25. AstraZeneca rose 2.2% to finish at 34.50.For the third quarter, Incyte reported adjusted income of 17 cents per share on $381.53 million in sales. Adjusted profit declined by 2 cents vs. the year-ago period, but topped analysts' average call for 6 cents. Sales grew nearly 42% and beat the consensus' $360 million view.Sales of cancer drug Jakafi posted a yearly gain of 36% to $304 million, topping analyst views for $287 million. The same drug is sold outside the U.S. by Novartis (NVS) as Jakavi. Incyte brought in $41 million in Jakavi royalties during the quarter, rising nearly 37%.Fellow cancer drug Iclusig tacked on an additional $5.37 million in the quarter to hit $18.1 million in sales, beating the consensus for $16.2 million, Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt wrote in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Incyte is one of six companies to win a Biotech Innovator Award from Investor's Business Daily. Head to the IBD Biotech Innovator Awards page for more on the six companies selected.Incyte boosted its full-year sales view for Jakafi to $1.125 billion to $1.135 billion, up from earlier expectations for $1.09 billion to $1.12 billion. The firm kept its Iclusig net product revenue model for $60 million to $65 million.""Nonetheless, the top end of Incyte's guidance implies flat fourth-quarter vs. third-quarter U.S. sales, perhaps suggesting some one-time factors such as inventory stocking may have contributed to this quarter's strong number,"" RBC analyst Brian Abrahams wrote in a note.Still, Incyte's deal with AstraZeneca could widen the market for epacadostat, which is known as an IDO1 inhibitor. Incyte also has deals to test epacadostat with drugs from Dow's Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), which are known as PD-1 inhibitors.AstraZeneca and Incyte will co-fund a Phase 3 trial of epacadostat and AstraZeneca's Imfinzi, a PD-L1 inhibitor, in patients with advanced lung cancer. The trial will test the regimen vs. Imfinzi alone. Leerink's Schmidt says the trial is expected to begin enrolling in the first half of 2018.PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors belong to a class of immuno-oncology drugs known as checkpoint inhibitors. Drugmakers are betting big their checkpoint inhibitors will pair well with IDO1 inhibitors, like epacadostat.""We do see this as an additional external validation for the promise of epacadostat,"" RBC analyst Abrahams said. ""Given (Imfinzi's) strong efficacy, the bar in this setting is high, but success could broaden the (advanced lung cancer) opportunity.""RELATED:6 Top Biotech Companies In Innovation Earn Recognition In New AwardsIncyte Cancer Treatment Uses Patients' Immune System To Fight DiseaseIncyte Joins Ranks Of Stocks With RS Ratings Over 90

That offered a trade with reasonable downside risk of 2.8%. One contract gives the holder the right to buy, but not the obligation, to buy 100 shares of Alibaba at 182.50 for a cost of $510, excluding commission.Keep in mind that when taking the premium paid into account, Alibaba would have to rally north of 187 for the trade to start making money.

Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said crude inventories shrank by 5.8 million barrels last week, while gasoline increased by 476,000 barrels.But those numbers are for last week, before the catastrophic storm slammed into the south Texas and the Gulf Coast.U.S. crude futures fell 1% to 45.96 a barrel, off earlier lows, and Brent crude retreated 2.2% to $50.86 a barrel. With many Gulf Coast refineries still shut down, unprocessed crude oil has been piling up and weighing on prices.But gasoline futures skyrocketed 5.7% to $1.885 a gallong, hitting a 25-month high intraday, as traders realize that refineries will be shut for some time. Motiva began fully shutting down the nation's largest refinery in Port Arthur, Texas, after it had run at 40% capacity on Tuesday. But the October gasoline contract was at $1.638 a gallon.Meanwhile, EIA said U.S. crude production was essentially unchanged at 9.53 million barrels a day, still near the record high of 9.61 million reached in June 2015. But that masked a drop in output in the lower 48 states, offset by an increase in Alaska.Shares of oil major Exxon Mobil (XOM) fell 0.5% on the stock market today, Chevron (CVX) retreated 0.1%, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) dipped 0.5% and BP (BP) was flat.IBD'S TAKE: Lower oil prices are weighting on producers but companies that use petroleum products in manufacturing, like Platform Specialty Products, are outperforming.Meanwhile, offshore drilling in the Gulf has fallen off since the shale boom took off more than 10 years ago, shifting more production inland to less hurricane-prone areas like the Permian Basin.Still, operations in the Eagle Ford shale formation in south Texas may take a hit and could show up in EIA's data next week, when inventories should also see big swings.On Tuesday, S&P Global Platts said roughly 2.33 million barrels per day of Texas refining capacity remained down, or 12.6% of U.S. capacity. In addition, refineries that are still online are also slowing run rates. If plants operate at 50% capacity, that would put the total loss at 3.36 million barrels per day, or 18% of total capacity, S&P Global Platts estimated.RELATED:This Chart Shows How Close U.S. Oil Production Is To A New Record High

1278,ADS,"Solar stocks will be watched closely Friday as the U.S. International Trade Commission is scheduled to rule on a petition that could have negative consequences for either Chinese or U.S. solar companies.The ITC will decide Friday whether to impose what is known as a Section 201 tariff on imported solar panels and modules from China. The ruling will address complaints by two solar manufacturers, Suniva, a privately held U.S. solar company, and Germany-based SolarWorld, which are calling for trade protections over cheap solar imports from China.If the ITC finds harm, it would then be sent to the White House for President Donald Trump to decide whether to grant the request of the two petitioners.Gordon Johnson, managing director of Axiom Capital Management, says Chinese solar stocks are about to ""get crushed"" as a result of the ruling.""Our checks suggest the ITC decision on Friday will disappoint to the downside,"" Johnson told Benzinga. ""We have been pounding the table on shorting Chinese solar stocks.""Among Chinese solar companies, JA Solar (JASO) tumbled 4.1% to close at 7.85 on the stock market today.

It said the precipitous decline in the cost of solar panels and modules has been the driving force behind the rapid adoption of solar generation.RELATED:First Solar Jumps On Buy Rating As Industry Gains StrengthCanadian Solar Shows Rising Price Performance With Jump To 93 RS Rating

1282,ADS,"The plunge in Facebook (FB) shares in high volume this week triggered a sell signal on the social networking leader and caused some head-scratching among analysts on Tuesday as to why it happened.XFacebook shares fell 4.5% Monday, following news reports that ranged from Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg revealing plans to sell a big chunk of stock and a Washington Post story that suggested the company could get smacked by a probe into advertisements connected with the U.S. elections. It was Facebook's steepest one-day drop since the 5.6% decline on Nov. 3.Monday's stock drop was preceded by two announcements after the market close Friday. Zuckerberg, in a Facebook blog post, said he would abandon plans to create a new class of company stock with no voting power. Connected to that was a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, also late Friday, that said Zuckerberg anticipates selling 35 million to 75 million shares of Facebook stock over 18 months in order to fund his philanthropic initiatives.Smaller concerns included confirmation that China was blocking Facebook's WhatsApp messaging app.But the straw that broke the camel's back, FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi says, was a Washington Post story that said former president Barack Obama tried to warn Zuckerberg last November about the threat of fake news on the social networking site during the 2016 election.""That appears to be the 'straw' which led to significant selling in Facebook's shares,"" Seyrafi wrote.Zuckerberg had initially rejected the idea that fake news on his company's social network played a key role in the U.S. election. But last week he acknowledged that Facebook had indeed been manipulated and would provide more than 3,000 politically themed advertisements to Congress as part of an investigation into Russia's meddling in the U.S. election. That could potentially lead to some government regulation on political ads and subject Facebook to more regulatory scrutiny, Seyrafi wrote.After Monday's drop, Facebook shares were up 0.8% to close at 164.21 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.

1283,ADS,"An analysis by IBD notes that on Monday Facebook shares fell sharply below its 50-day line as volume surged, triggering a sell signal. It was the deepest drop below the key support level since early November. The stock had been working on a narrow flat base with a 175.59 buy point. The base is second stage.Facebook has shown solid action after a breakout in January over a 129.37 cup-with-handle buy point. Short-term traders could have used the Aug. 10 drop below the 10-day moving average as a sell signal to lock in gains.If Facebook ends the week sharply below the 10-week moving average and sees volume rising at least 40% above the 10-week average, the chances of a significant correction and a new base are high. Such was the case after Facebook got drilled by sellers in the week ended Aug. 21, 2015, falling 9% that week in weekly volume that jumped 45% above average. The next week, stocks suffered from the August 2015 tiny flash crash.Another possible reason for the Facebook stock drop, said Seyrafi, is a general rotation out of technology stocks into financials and the Russell 2000.Seyrafi has an outperform rating on Facebook and a price target of 210.RELATED:Facebook Stock Quotes, Company News And Chart AnalysisFANG Stock Is At A Make-Or-Break Moment; Here's WhyFANG Stocks News & Quotes

Here's a list of stocks near buy points to watch ahead of third-quarter results. Earlier Thursday, the IEA said, ""There is little doubt that leading producers have recommitted to do whatever it takes to underpin the market.""Yet despite OPEC's pact to curb production, it rose last month by 100,000 barrels per day as higher output from Libya and Iraq offset declines in Venezuela, according to the IEA. Compliance with the current deal was 88% for the month and 86% year-to-date with production from the autonomous Kurdistan region of Iraq one of the least compliant.The IEA sees non-OPEC supply rising by 700,000 bpd this year and by 1.5 million in 2018, with the U.S. accounting for most of the gains.The Paris-based energy watchdog also kept its demand forecast unchanged and still sees 2017 demand growth of 1.6% or 1.6 million barrels per day this year and demand growth of 1.4% or 1.4 million bpd in 2018.The IEA sees demand for OPEC's oil climbing to 32.98 million bpd in the fourth quarter before falling to 31.87 million bpd in the first three months of 2018.RELATED: Royal Dutch Shell Charges Into A Future Beyond OilIEA Sees OPEC Extending Deal; Oil Falls On U.S. Stockpile GainEnergy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, Coal

1296,ADS,"President Trump's declaration that opioid abuse  is a public health emergency is sparking debate about addiction.  Tragically, myths and misinformation are blocking the path to preventing more deaths.Start with the causes of the opioid crisis. On Face the Nation, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, chair of Trump's opioid commission,  blamed over-prescribing doctors.  ""This crisis started not on a street corner somewhere. This crisis started in the doctor's offices and hospitals of America.""  That's untrue, Governor.XIt contradicts scientific evidence and lets drug abusers off the hook. At least three quarters of opioid pill abusers and almost all heroin addicts got hooked  without ever having been prescribed  pain medication for an injury or illness, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.Emergency room records show only a  fraction — 13% — of opioid overdose victims began taking drugs because of  pain, according to the medical journal JAMA Internal Medicine. The media feature many stories about patients who needed pain killers and later became addicts, but these are exceptions, not the rule.Experimenting with opioids — whether heroin or pills — is almost always a choice.  A bad choice.Young adults account for 90% of first time abusers.  To protect the next generation from making that mistake,  Trump proposes a ""massive advertising campaign to get people, especially children, not to want to take drugs in the first place."" The liberal media mock Trump's proposal as a throwback to the 1980s, but in fact he's on the mark.For decades, popular music has glamorized drug use. Late night host Jimmy Kimmel pays lip service to tackling tough political issues, but his guest line-up this week includes Ty Dolla $ign, whose music videos  showcase drug use.Trump's offering  an alternative  message. History proves it can work.In 2012 and 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ran  hard hitting and graphic ads against smoking, with ex-smokers talking about their own lung disease, cancer, and other miseries.The ads cut smoking among youth and convinced 400,000 smokers to quit for good. Trump's campaign should be just as terrifying. Show hospitalized teens with their arms amputated because of infections from heroin needles, and brain-damaged overdose victims in nursing homes.Warning about  opioid abuse sounds like a no-brainer.  So why do activists like  Kassandra Frederique of the  Drug Policy Alliance deplore ""the persistent stigma of drug use""?  As if we're not supposed to hurt addicts' feelings. With drug overdose deaths at record highs, that's misguided.You no longer see smoking in movies or  on television. Stigmatizing cigarettes worked.  So why de-stigmatize opioids? We can help those already hooked without doing that.Christie calls addiction a ""disease."" It's true that some people succumb to it more than others.But new research suggests the disease metaphor could be hurtful. Addicts who believe they have the free will to quit  have a much higher success rate than those who think of themselves as diseased, according to new research from the University of Minnesota and Florida State University. Quitting Parkinson's or Alzheimer's isn't possible, but getting off drugs is.Harvard professor Gene Heyman insists addicts can choose to stop using drugs. once ""the penalties for excessive use become overwhelming,"" such as losing their job or their kids.Half of addicts who quit do it without treatment.  The drug treatment industry doesn't want you to know that. The industry's salivating for more public funds, and joining Democrats in bashing Trump for not spending more.But he's right.  Families exhaust their savings and taxpayers foot ever-mounting bills for treatment despite  a dismal success rate (under 30%) at most rehabs.To save lives and get better results for the $50 billion already being spent yearly, Washington needs to stop pinning the blame on the medical community, scrap political correctness and turn to the research. And most important, bombard young people with warnings against ever trying drugs.

1298,ADS,"As manager Joseph Fath closes in on his fourth anniversary at the helm of T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund (PRGFX) in January, the $50.7 billion portfolio continues to outperform. Its 28.73% gain this year going into Thursday outpaced 88% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Direct. Over the past three years it has notched a 14.54% annual gain, topping 92% of its direct rivals.XThe fund has managed its torrid pace by targeting leading stocks like e-commerce powerhouse Alibaba Group (BABA), graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and online payment processor PayPal Holdings (PYPL). Those stocks are up 94%, 81% and 80% so far this year. Alibaba and PayPal have been in the portfolio since the third quarter of 2016 and fourth quarter of 2015, respectively.Nvidia has been in and out of the portfolio in recent quarters.Fath and his growth stock team look for companies that have one or more of these traits: superior growth in earnings and cash flow; sustainable earnings momentum even in economic slowdowns; and a lucrative niche in the economy and ability to grow — even amid slow GDP growth.Take Alibaba. ""Alibaba continues to benefit from improving user engagement amid its ongoing social commerce and mobile monetization efforts,"" Fath told shareholders in his semiannual report. ""The massive amount of data that its users generate also provide the company with a competitive advantage that could drive long-term earnings growth.""The Chinese Amazon's earnings-per-share growth has accelerated, having grown 30%, 37% and 60% the past three quarters. Annual EPS has grown for four years in a row. Consensus among analysts is that it will rise 44% this year.Alibaba is a longtime member of the Leaderboard — IBD's premium service that spotlights play-by-play moves of top stocks.Nvidia was been in and out of the portfolio in recent quarters as the fund initially took profits and then returned to the stock as we gained more conviction in the investment thesis, the growth stock team said.The stock's EPS growth is part of that process of persuasion. Its growth was at a triple-digit pace in four of the past five quarters. Still, operating costs have risen as the company invests in artificial intelligence and self-driving cars.The stock is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. That's due to achievements such as a 54% annual EPS growth rate over the past three years.IBD'S TAKE: You can see how Nvidia other fundamental and technical traits stack up against its rivals' in IBD's easy-to-understand Stock Checkup.PayPal EPS has also sped up, growing 9%, 13%, 17%, 19%, 28% and 31% in the past six quarters.The stock ranks No. 1 in IBD's Finance-Credit Card/Payment Processor industry group thanks to traits such as four straight years of annual EPS growth.The 31% September-quarter profit topped analysts' views. So did the 21% revenue increase. PayPal issued a current-quarter sales forecast that topped analyst estimates.PayPal is among the IBD 50 roster of fast-growing companies.""We have a high conviction in PayPal as digital online payments are growing significantly on a global scale,"" Fath told shareholders. ""The company's strong balance sheet and the potential to monetize its Venmo peer-to-peer payment platform could lead to further outperformance.""Can Fath keep his streak going? That hinges partly on the performance of new stock buys, such as credit reporting bureau TransUnion (TRU), credit-card payment processor Vantiv (VNTV) and security software firm Symantec (SYMC).TransUnion shares got clobbered in the second week of September amid consumer anger and congressional inquiries sparked by the Equifax (EFX) data breach. But shares have rallied since then, resuming an uptrend that began late in 2016.While credit bureaus suffered withering criticism after the Equifax cyberattack, most of TransUnion's business comes from corporations. Only 23% of its revenue is from what the company calls its consumer interactive segment.And TransUnion has reinforced the corporate-focused part of its business with steps like its acquisition of Datalink Services, a leading provider of vehicle and driving records. The acquisition should enable TransUnion's DriverRisk to offer insurers a full-driving record platform.TransUnion, due to report third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct. 27, was expected by analysts to post a 21% increase in earnings.Vantiv provides credit, debit and prepaid payment processing. It ranks No. 10 in PayPal's IBD industry group.Last summer the company beat rivals like PayPal to the punch by acquiring British-based Worldpay Group. The deal greatly expanded Vantiv's online capabilities.Third-quarter EPS, reported Thursday, rose 27% to 90 cents, up from Q2's 19% gain. Charles Drucker, president and CEO of Vantiv, said in a release, ""We are investing in high growth segments of the market, including our combination with Worldpay, which will position us as a global acquirer with a leading position in e-commerce.""Symantec develops internet and network security, storage and systems management applications for consumers and enterprises.Shares initially jumped on news of the Equifax breach. They've pulled back a little since early October, but have found support at their 50-day moving average.EPS grew an average of 21% in each of the past three quarters. Analysts estimate a 43% increase for the current stanza and 53% for the current fiscal year.RELATED:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeTop Mutual Fund Manager Has Several Stocks In Buy Zone

1299,ADS,"Facebook (FB) hit a record high Friday, as investors delighted in other giant tech firms reporting strong earnings.But while the social media giant felt the love as Amazon (AMZN), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) also hit their own new all-time highs, shareholders may want to proceed with caution. Facebook still is days away from reporting its own third-quarter results.XOverall, investor sentiment toward Facebook has remained positive throughout 2017, with shares up 54% this year. Despite concerns around decelerating ad revenue growth and increasing competition, Facebook has grown well above industry growth rates.How all this translates into revenue and earnings growth will come into focus when Facebook reports after the market close Wednesday.Analysts see Facebook reporting revenue of $9.88 billion, up 41% from the year ago quarter, maintaining a long string of double-digit gains. The consensus on adjusted earnings, as polled by Zacks Investment Research, is $1.30, up 44%.Facebook shares gained 4.3% to 177.88 on the stock market today.Buying or holding a stock just ahead of an earnings report can be risky. Even though a company might have top-notch fundamentals and a compelling growth story, even just a single number that misses or beats the consensus estimates of Wall Street analysts can sometimes cause a wild reaction in either direction, as seen with Amazon, Google and Microsoft.Amazon passed the 1,100 mark en route to a new all-time high Friday as the e-commerce leader received multiple price-target hikes after posting quarterly results that smashed estimates. In recent action, Amazon shares finished the regular trading session up 13.2% to 1,100.95 on the stock market today.Microsoft also posted quarterly results after the close Thursday that raced past expectations. Microsoft shares gained 6.4% to 83.81, also a new high.Google parent Alphabet exceeded estimates as well. Alphabet shares hit their own high, closing up 4.3% to 1,033.67 and a new high.On the other hand there was Baidu (BIDU). Shares of the China internet search leader plunged after reporting third-quarter results that beat revenue estimates but forecast December-quarter sales that were well below estimates.Baidu sank 9% to 236.88.IBD'S TAKE: This earnings options strategy can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter. And here's a simple routine to help you understand how to invest in the stock market.On Friday, Facebook was added to IBD's exclusive Leaderboard list of stocks, but as an earnings options play.In a note to clients, UBS analyst Eric Sheridan maintained a buy rating on Facebook and price target of 190.""We think investors are looking for continued user growth, engagement and improving ad unit economics to drive top-line momentum and forward EBITDA margin stability,"" Sheridan wrote.

1303,ADS,"Jeffrey Leiden's office shelves are plastered with all the accoutrements you'd expect from the chief executive of a $39 billion biotech. But from the awards, letters of accommodation and inevitable family photos, emerges a theme.Gratitude.Leiden's Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) currently aims to treat 31,000 cystic fibrosis patients across the globe. Cystic fibrosis is a progressive, genetic lung condition and those who survive into adulthood generally don't live past the age of 38, according to most estimates.XIn 2012, Vertex set out to change that and the success it's seen with two medicines — soon to be three — on the market have generated the 50 to 100 pieces of mail plastered to Leiden's shelves. They're letters of thanks from graduates and newlyweds.""We get about 50 (letters and emails) a week from patients and families thanking us for what we do,"" Leiden told Investor's Business Daily. ""We know all these patients. Most of them are kids and teenagers and we watch them grow up. It's like being part of a family. Not a company.""Vertex wasn't always a cystic fibrosis play. In earlier days, it was focused on treating hepatitis C and launched a drug known as Incivek in 2011. Then Gilead Sciences (GILD) launched its drug, Sovaldi. That launch was one of the most successful in history. It also nearly put Vertex out of business.Though Incivek became a blockbuster drug shortly after its launch, Vertex pulled it from the market in 2014 as demand withered. Leiden describes that time as one of ""crisis"" for the company.""We were in the middle of a crisis,"" he said. ""We had gone from being a hepatitis C company with a billion-dollar drug for literally one year to essentially zero revenue. And there are very few companies that can, frankly, survive that kind of crisis simply because it's so hard to pivot to a new area or drug.""But for 13 years, a division of the company in San Diego had been quietly working in the cystic fibrosis arena. The indication fit in with Leiden's strategy: investing in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for serious diseases with large unmet medical needs in specialty areas.Vertex's specialty focus allows it to keep its sales and marketing forces slim which, in turn, allows it to reinvest nearly nine in 10 dollars of its revenue back into research and development. It sells cystic fibrosis drugs in the U.S. with a sales force of fewer than 20, Leiden said.Fast forward to 2017. Vertex has two drugs on the market — Kalydeco and Orkambi. In the second quarter, sales of Kalydeco, its first approved cystic fibrosis drug, grew 5% year over year to $190 million and Orkambi rocketed 32% to $324 million.Year to date, Vertex stock has more than doubled, rising 108%. Shares began forming a cup with handle and a 163.74 buy point in late July. Meanwhile, the broader biotech industry group has risen 28% and is ranked eighth out of 197 groups tracked, up from No. 20 just 13 weeks ago.Shares of Vertex dipped 0.5% to close at 151.26 on Friday.Vertex is a rarity among biotechs, in a way. Its pipeline is almost solely in cystic fibrosis. Of 13 drugs in its pipeline not already licensed out to bigger pharmaceuticals, 11 are in cystic fibrosis. Leiden acknowledges the risk from a portfolio standpoint.But some products simply don't make sense for Vertex, he said. Vertex has farmed out drugs in flu and cancer to Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Merck KGaA because the enormous sales contingent it would take to sell drugs in those indications would take away from reinvesting in science.Reinvesting in science has allowed Vertex to do something else unique. Whereas medicines from other firms target the symptoms of cystic fibrosis, Vertex is working to correct the genetic underlying causes of the disease to, eventually, prevent infants diagnosed with it from ever fully developing it.The underlying science focuses on about 200 genetic mutations that can be divided into four ""buckets,"" Leiden said. Kalydeco can treat 10% of patients. Orkambi, a combination of Kalydeco and a drug known as lumacaftor, can treat another 50%. Eventually, though, Vertex plans to treat 90% of patients.Getting to that third ""bucket"" of patients, though, will require a three-pronged treatment strategy. Already, the ""backbone"" for that triple is being considered for approval in the U.S. and Europe: A combination of Kalydeco and a drug called tezacaftor. That looks likely to be approved in February 2018.On top of Kalydeco/tezacaftor, Vertex is adding a ""next-generation corrector,"" a drug that can fix other abnormalities in genes to treat another 30% of patients. Vertex has strong Phase 1 data for three next-generation correctors in combination with Kalydeco/tezacaftor, and a fourth ready to read out soon.The eventual goal is to decide which of the four possible triple-pill combinations will provide the most efficient treatment with few to no side effects. After that, Vertex plans to use gene editing to treat the last 10% of cystic fibrosis patients for whom traditional small molecule medicines won't work.Leiden won't comment on when he expect a triple-pill to get approval. He sees pivotal trials beginning next year. Most analysts take that to mean the U.S. Food and Drug Administration could approve a triple-pill from Vertex in 2019-20.Vertex's goal with the triple is to prevent infants, less than 1 year of age, from developing cystic fibrosis as it's known today. In adults who already have lung damage, Kalydeco has been shown to improve lung function within two weeks and, over time, slow the rate of decline in lung function.IBD'S TAKE: Vertex is among several leaders nearing a buy zone. Head to IBD's list, Stocks Near A Buy Zone, for other near-term opportunities including an entertainment stock and a financial services play.""Rather than declining at 1%-2% per year, they decline at 0.75% per year in lung function,"" Leiden said. ""And while that may not sound that significant, it's sort of like compounded interest. Take that over a lifetime and it makes an enormous difference in both their survival and their quality of life.""The quality of life improvement is huge, Leiden said.""They used to go to the hospital four to five times per year. Now it's zero to one time per year,"" he said. ""They used to be on a transplant list. Now they're not a transplant list. They used to be able to walk one block. Now they can walk miles. It's not just their longevity but their quality of life.""Galapagos (GLPG) and AbbVie (ABBV) have teamed up to follow in Vertex's steps, but both Leiden and JMP Securities analyst Liisa Bayko are doubtful the duo can catch up. To get FDA approval for a triple-pill combo, they must show strong data for each component first.Bayko estimates Galapagos is several years behind and even if it does make it to market, its triple-pill would have to have outstanding efficiency to persuade Vertex's patients to switch to a new medicine.""Vertex has done a good job at continually improving on its meds,"" she told IBD. ""They keep moving the bar higher. They make it challenging for people to want to go on a drug that will be just as good as Vertex's. Why would you want to do that if you can just get on Vertex's drug?""Some are more bearish, though. Jefferies analyst Michael Yee sees Galapagos eventually getting 20% of the cystic fibrosis market. Still, he notes Vertex has created a strong setup for itself with making barriers to entering the market high and delivering strong medicines.He, like others, questions what Vertex will do after its cystic fibrosis well runs dry. Leiden acknowledges the cystic fibrosis journey is nearing an end but says Vertex has plans to shift into other rare diseases like sickle cell, a genetic lung/liver condition and a deadly nerve disorder.""Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (a lung/liver condition) looks a lot like cystic fibrosis,"" Leiden said. ""We have the technology and we know how to go after it.""And as to the bears skeptical about Vertex's cystic fibrosis pipeline?""There's a group of analysts or investors out there that say, 'Well, it's really great they want to do that but we'll see if they're able to, I'm skeptical,'"" he said. ""The reason that's weird to me is we've already done it. We've proven we can do it and we've proven the model.""""I don't think it's a question anymore. I think we've demonstrated it works.""RELATED:Why The Biotech 'Catch-Up Rally' Could Add Another 15%-20%Celgene Breaks Out; These 2 Biotech Giants Close On Buy PointsTop Biotech Stock Near Buy Zone After FDA Drug Approval

1304,ADS,"OPEC and Russian didn't announce a deal to extend the current output cuts Friday and won't make a decision before January, but the committee's openness to an extension and a push for increased monitoring could be a sign the cartel won't aggressively ramp up production next year.At a Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee meeting in Vienna, delegates from OPEC and Russia agreed to use secondary source production data to monitor production as it pushes for a higher compliance rate, but no decision was made on extending cuts.""We discussed global oil deal extension, there is such an option, but it is too early to take a decision,"" said Russian oil minster Alexander Novak, according to Reuters.He reportedly said the group won't decide on extending output limits before January.#OPEC and other #oil exporters won't decide on extending output limits before January - #Russia #Energy minister#OOTT #Saudi #Libya #Iraq pic.twitter.com/DVkGZ0478u— Christopher Johnson (@chris1reuters) September 22, 2017U.S. crude rose 0.2% to settle at $50.66 a barrel.Chevron (CVX) shares closed up 0.7% at 117.29 on the stock market today.

1305,ADS,"Shares in Sprint (S) and T-Mobile US (TMUS) gained Friday on yet another report that the two wireless service providers are moving closer to a merger agreement, though respective parents Softbank (SFTBY) and Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY) may still be weeks away from clinching a deal.XSprint stock surged 6.1% to close at 8.52 on the stock market today. T-Mobile stock ended the regular trading session up 1.1% to 64.06. Shares in Verizon Communications (VZ) and AT&T (T) also edged up.Sprint is up more than 40% since Republican Donald Trump won November's presidential election. One view is that the Trump administration could approve a Sprint merger with T-Mobile, though regulators have opposed reducing the number of national wireless firms to three from four.While Sprint's stock has shot up; short interest in the stock also has been going up.""We remain confused by Sprint's 15% short interest,"" said Jennifer Fritzsche, a Wells Fargo analyst in a report on Tuesday.Jonathan Chaplin, analyst at New Street Research, said in an email that the short interest likely ""reflects that a portion of the market believes that even if a deal is attempted it won't be approved by regulators. Further, that absent a deal, Sprint is doomed or at the very least, the equity is worth a lot less than $8 (per share).""If a merger is announced, how much of a premium Sprint could get over where its stock is trading has been debated by analysts. With Sprint's run-up, ""some level of M&A premium is already baked into current valuation,"" said a Barclays report.There's speculation an all-stock deal would give Deutsche Telekom a majority stake and management control.Softbank chairman Masayoshi Son signaled in the spring that Softbank would be willing to cede control in order to get a deal done. But what Son wants in return for that concession is another question analysts have been asking.Key to structuring an all-stock deal is an ""exchange ratio"" for shares that would reflect each companies valuation.

1306,ADS,"Everyone knows high prescription drug prices are a problem, but except for pharma stockholders, few people may realize that price cuts are rippling through the generic side of the industry.Take a look at recent events: Tumbling U.S. generic drug prices wiped out billions of dollars in market value in August for the likes of Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA), Mylan (MYL) and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY). That compounded the industry's woes after a brutal second-quarter earnings season.The relatively small contingent of pharma companies that produce cheaper versions of brand-name drugs is getting broadsided by players in the distribution chain. For one, leading wholesalers are squeezing drugmakers for lower prices to undercut one another in the battle for pharmacy contracts. Meanwhile, group-purchasing organizations are consolidating and grabbing onto more negotiating power, representing a hurdle for generics which comprise a large chunk of those purchases.Analysts say it could be six to nine months before prices stabilize — if they ever recover at all. While that means lower prices for patients, drugmakers are taking the brunt of the battle. Prices have clearly deteriorated in the aftermath of contract negotiations, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in an Aug. 12 audio report.""And the question really is: What does that mean going forward?,"" he said. ""Because if you look at the way Mylan and Teva stocks have behaved and you look at the way their estimates have been revised, it clearly suggests a material worsening in business.""Teva stock lost 50.7% in August, though it has recovered 7.9% this month, and the No. 1 drugmaker by market cap is close to losing that status. Since July 31, Teva's market value has fallen by nearly half to $17.56 billion. Comparatively, Mylan trails at a $16.85 billion cap.Teva isn't the only one feeling the pain. Selling pressures shaved $4 billion off Mylan's market capitalization in August, and its shares have toppled 19% since the beginning of August after particularly disheartening quarterly reports. As a whole, Investor's Business Daily's Generic Drugs industry group is down 6.6% year to date after nearing a four-year low in August. It's ranked No. 160 out of the 197 groups tracked by IBD.The underlying cause of the price erosion stems back to 2013-14, when drugmakers spiked prices based on shortages, monopolies and other opportunities, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan told IBD.""If something was $10 per day, you would see it up to $15 per day because you're the only one making it and there was no competition,"" he said. ""If there's no one else producing it, you have more flexibility (in how you price a drug).""""Now that card is gone,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: Teva has an IBD Composite Rating of 5 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it performs in the bottom 5% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. The top-ranked generic drugmaker is Ani Pharmaceuticals, which has a middling CR of 61. Visit IBD Stock Checkup for a look at the stocks.That's not only because competition is more fierce, it's also that generics face another adversary: heavy scrutiny from the media and in Washington. In January, then President-elect Donald Trump accused drugmakers of ""getting away with murder"" in their pricing. Now, he's aiming to use competition to undercut prices.Complicating matters, some drugmakers — Teva, Mylan and Perrigo (PRGO) included — are under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice for alleged generic drug price fixing. Last month, two members of Congress sent letters to makers of multiple sclerosis drugs to probe rising drug prices.That's yet another wrench in the generic story, Divan says.""Investors are looking for cleaner stories,"" he said. ""And there's too much unknown here.""Teva and Mylan, on their second-quarter earnings calls, projected price erosion in the high-single digits for the rest of 2017. Mylan specified that erosion would take place in its North American generics unit. That followed lackluster quarterly reports from both. Mylan's North American sales declined 9%, while Teva's numbers were helped by the acquisition of Actavis Generics.Both Teva and Mylan cut their 2017 forecasts. On their calls, executives from the two companies acknowledged an increase in generic approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was champing at sales. New FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb is looking to speed up generic approvals even more to help ease drug prices, which is in line with Trump's vision.""During the quarter we saw increased competition resulting from FDA's focus on accelerating the approvals of third, fourth or fifth generics,"" Mylan President Rajiv Malik said. ""Unfortunately, we have not seen the same for the first generics nor for more complex and niche products.""As a result, Mylan said it would delay launching generic versions of the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) asthma drug Advair and Teva's multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone amid the ""uncertain U.S. regulatory environment.""Teva's former interim chief executive, Yitzhak Peterburg, cited customer consolidation, an increase in FDA generic-drug approvals and products that were either delayed or subject to more competition for ""accelerated price erosion and decreased volume"" in the second quarter.FDA approval complications were cited across second-quarter reports, Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler said in an Aug. 17 report to clients. Though generic approvals are catching some wind under the FDA's new goal, complex generics — a molecular copy that also has a complex active ingredient, formulation, route or device combination — have been subject to administrative delays.Koffler sees Mylan as best-positioned to rebound despite its tie to the challenged generics sector. The firm has a pipeline of complex generics and biosimilars, guidance is now more realistic and it's less levered than its peers, meaning it could pursue acquisitions of companies whose stocks have dropped.""The risks are that pricing pressure in the U.S. may not abate, and the overall profitability of the company is declining as it expands into lower-margin international markets that now comprise a greater percentage of its revenue,"" she said.A few drugmakers seemingly escaped the second-quarter malaise. But those reports were somewhat misleading, CFRA analyst Jeffrey Loo told IBD.Perrigo issued a beat-and-raise that helped its stock fly 16% in a day. Though Perrigo's generic drug sales toppled 13% year over year, its separate consumer health segments had smaller 4% and 9% declines in the U.S. and internationally, respectively.Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) crushed second-quarter profit views, though sales came in a hair light. The firm also cut its 2017 revenue target, but kept its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization forecast.""A lot of people consider Valeant as a generic play, but the bulk of the business is now Bausch & Lomb"" eye-care products, Loo said. In the quarter, revenue from Bausch & Lomb as well as Salix, its gastrointestinal-drugs division, represented 73% of total sales. Its smaller generics unit, on the other hand, fell by 33%.""If you exclude Valeant from the generic space and Perrigo, none of these generic drugmakers really bucked the trend in the second quarter,"" Loo said. ""I think that it (pressure on the group) will likely continue going forward for the next two quarters.""Teva leads the U.S. generic drugs sector, but it's also under the most pressure, Steven Schoenfeld, chief information officer of BlueStar Indexes, told IBD. BlueStar Indexes tracks Israeli equities. Cybersecurity play Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) is now bigger than Teva in terms of market cap, at $18.18 billion.Former Teva Chief Executive Erez Vigodman stepped down in February amid a bribery investigation. Since then, management has been shaky and the firm's strategy has been out of kilter, Schoenfeld says. This followed its loss of several key patents protecting MS drug Copaxone in January. In September, Teva named former Lundbeck and Novo Nordisk (NVO) veteran Kare Schultz as its new chief executive officer.Still, Teva is splitting its focus between generic and branded drugs, Schoenfeld says.""They need a strategy,"" he said. ""They need to see if they want to expand or continue to invest in blockbuster drugs. They've now got some early-stage Alzheimer's assets and other drugs. They have to decide if they're going to be X percentage generic and, if so, do the profits go into innovation?""Meanwhile, debt has rocketed and investors are no longer sure the $40.5 billion Teva paid to acquire Actavis Generics from Allergan (AGN) was a good price, he says. As of June 30, Teva had $35.1 billion in debt, rising from $34.6 billion at the end of March.Under Schultz, Teva recently avoided a covenant violation on its debt. On Sept. 19, Teva said it amended several term loans and revolving credit facilities, ""providing Teva greater flexibility in its financial leverage ratio covenants.""The question at the forefront now is whether the U.S. generic drugs sector has hit a bottom.In recent history, Mylan has come under scrutiny for the pricing of its emergency allergy injection, EpiPen. Turing Pharmaceuticals' former chief executive, Martin Shkreli, drew criticism for spiking the price of a decades-old HIV drug. Teva is among those being looked at for MS drug prices.""Popular culture has turned against it,"" BlueStar's Schoenfeld said. ""Secular trends aren't going to go away. The market sees pricing pressure. Have these stocks priced in the worst? Teva is trading where it had major support in the 2001-03 time frame. But I wouldn't recommend anyone plunge into Teva.""Most firms are now trading at four to five times their earnings, CFRA's Loo says. Amid continuing price erosion, he sees the stocks trading sideways for the next six months. He notes there aren't many drugs going off patent in the near future, causing somewhat of a roadblock for new generics.""I would like to hope they've hit a bottom,"" he said. ""There are not that many catalysts for them going forward. You might see some buyers step in and buy shares of these companies. Four to five times earnings is an awfully attractive valuation.""RELATED:Biogen, Teva Slip After Democrats Launch MS Drug Pricing ProbeThis Toppling Generic Drugmaker Could Be Poised For A Rebound: AnalystHow A Falling Generic Drugmaker Got An Analyst's UpgradeGeneric Drugs Are Rebound Despite Teva, Mylan Free-FallPerrigo's Beat-And-Raise Lifts Generic Drugs, Bucks Teva-Mylan Trend

1314,ADS,"In their book ""Shattered,"" Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes report that within 24 hours of losing the presidential election, Hillary Clinton was ordering her campaign to argue that it was hacked by Russia. Just as reporters leaped to find ""news"" to corroborate her allegations of a ""vast right-wing conspiracy"" (VRWC for short) during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, they have lunged at stories of Russian interference to validate VRWC 2.0.Second verse, same as the first. The media outlets most deeply invested in the narrative about Russia having somehow masterfully manipulated the 2016 election are beginning to struggle as the actual facts tumble out. Getting a closer look at the Russia Facebook postings doesn't help the Sore Loser Chorus. In fact, it demolishes it.The New York Times posted a story on Oct. 9 headlined ""How Russia Harvested American Rage to Reshape U.S. Politics."" But there in the details was a dramatic shapelessness, a borrowing from the left and the right, that ultimately underscored why the story should have never been published in the first place.Times reporters Nicholas Confessore and Daisuke Wakabayashi explained that one Russian Facebook page was called ""the United Muslims of America,"" which often shared posts and videos about American Islamophobia. It stole a YouTube video produced by a man named Waqas Shah in which actors he'd paid shoved him around in New York City to see whether bystanders would object. They did not. So America is bigoted.But another Russian account called ""Being Patriotic"" spread a widely circulated internet hoax about how Muslim men in Michigan were collecting welfare payments for multiple wives. So the Russians were both protesting Islamophobia ... and promoting it. How is that ""reshaping"" our election process? It is what it is: an attempt to inflame both ends of the spectrum and set them to war against each other.If the Times is trying to corroborate Clinton's Russia-Trump conspiracy, it is not helping itself when it reports in the same piece that the Russians caused Americans on both sides of the divide to promote their material. It noted that a Facebook page called ""Blacktivist"" carried ""passionate denunciations of the criminal justice system and viral videos of police violence."" One of the posts about the death of a black teenager in a fight with police in Bridgeport, Connecticut, was reposted by Black Lives Matter Chicago.The Being Patriotic page also stirred up conservatives with a message against more refugee settlements in America. But here's the glaring difference in coverage: The Times asked conservative social-media activists how they felt about having been used by the Russians, but they didn't get any quotes from Black Lives Matter about having been manipulated.Washington Examiner correspondent Byron York dealt a major blow to these Russia-Trump conspiracy theories by reporting facts that Facebook itself has revealed.Nothing the Clintonistas have cited as the ""real killers"" of her presidential hopes has turned out to be true. Clinton wanted Donald Trump as her opponent. Then she couldn't vanquish him. And now she can't face it.RELATED:Is Any Part Of The Russia Election Hacking Story True?Now Hillary Wants To Challenge The Election?

1319,ADS,"Nasdaq 100 futures soared Friday morning after a wave of big earnings late Thursday. Megacap techs Amazon.com (AMZN), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) are all up sharply, with the two FANG stocks signaling likely buying opportunities. Chip plays Intel (INTC) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) also advanced. But Baidu (BIDU) was among several losers.XNasdaq 100 futures surged 1.35% above fair value. S&P 500 index futures rose 0.4% vs. fair value while Dow futures were up nearly 0.3%.During Thursday's stock market trading, the S&P 500 rose 0.1% and the Dow 0.3%, while the Nasdaq composite retreated 0.1%.Amazon earned 52 cents a share a share, obliterating views for just 1 cent. Revenue grew 34% to $43.7 billion, beating the consensus for $42 billion. Amazon Web Services revenue leapt 42% to $4.58 billion in Q3. AWS had operating profit of $1.171 billion vs. the companywide $347 million.Amazon shot up 7.4% to 1,044 in early trading. That suggests a high-volume rebound from its 50-day moving average, which would offer a buying opportunity. However, the stock could find resistance below its old high of 1,083.31. Amazon is in a late-stage flat base with a potential entry of 1,083.41.  Keep in mind that overnight action doesn't always translate into how a stock will open or close the following session.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. If you owned Amazon, you're happy now, but Baidu holders seem headed for a big retreat. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Adjusted earnings climbed 32% from a year ago, with revenue jumping 24% to $27.77 billion. Both cleared earnings views.Google doesn't break out its cloud computing revenue, grouping it in ""other revenues,"" which rose 40% to $3.405 billion. Google executives touted cloud growth on its post-Q3 call. Google reached a deal with Cisco Systems (CSCO) this week to market its cloud-computing services to the enterprise market as it takes on Amazon Web Services and Microsoft's Azure.Alphabet shares rose 3.2% to 1,023.59 early Friday. That suggests the stock will retake a 1006.29 buy point briefly cleared earlier this month.Google gets most of its money from online advertising. So its gains there bode well for Facebook (FB), which will report earnings in early November. Facebook shares rose 1.7% to 173.49 in the premarket, trying to get back above a 175.59 entry.Microsoft earnings rose 17% to 84 cents a share, defying views for a dip to 72 cents. Revenue grew 12% to $24.54 billion. Microsoft said its Azure cloud-computing revenue shot up 90%, though it didn't give an actual dollar figure. The Intelligent Cloud division, which includes Azure and Windows Server, saw a 14% gain to $6.9 billion.""This quarter we exceeded $20 billion in commercial cloud (annualized revenue run rate), outpacing the goal we set just over two years ago,"" Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella said in a  statement.Microsoft rose 4.6% to 82.38 early. The Dow tech titan's stock was already modestly extended from a breakout.Baidu appeared to deliver earnings that crushed third-quarter estimates. But the Chinese search giant, which is becoming a big leader in artificial intelligence, gave weak Q4 guidance. Baidu shares fell 8.8% to 237.65 in the premarket, signaling a move below its 50-day moving average. Baidu hasn't had a very long run and it's unclear how heavy the weekly volume will be, so this may not trigger a clear long-term sell signal.(During Thursday's session, Chinese for-profit education stocks Tal Education (TAL) and New Oriental Education (EDU) did trip long-term sell signals, including high-volume sell-offs through their 10-week lines.)In addition to Baidu, Mattel (MAT) and Expedia (EXPE) were huge overnight losers while Cerner (CERN) and Fortinet (FTNT) also sold off following their quarterly reports.RELATED:Google Shoots To All-Time High After Beating Earnings ViewsAmazon Blows Past Earnings Views, Beats On Sales; Shares SoarMicrosoft Tops September-Quarter Sales, Earnings TargetsBaidu Dives On Weak Revenue Forecast

1328,ADS,"Shares in Sprint (S) and T-Mobile US (TMUS) climbed Tuesday amid yet another report that their stalled merger talks may be inching forward.Sprint stock jumped 6.8% to close at 8.20 on the stock market today. T-Mobile was up 5.9% to 65.42.CNBC's David Faber reported that SoftBank-controlled Sprint and Deutsche Telekom's (DTEGY) T-Mobile are again in talks. At a Goldman Sachs conference last week, neither company mentioned progress toward a deal, while T-Mobile expressed ""fatigue"" over the issue.Deutsche Telekom, which has a board meeting today, has told analysts it's comfortable with its U.S. wireless business staying independent amid market share gains vs. AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ).Ulrich Rathe, a Jefferies analyst, says Deutsche Telekom doesn't feel pressured to do a deal. ""On M&A, Deutsche Telekom argues there is no pressure, in particular no 'last chance to deal',"" Rathe said in a Sept. 13 report.Aside from worries that U.S. regulators might block a Sprint-T-Mobile merger, there are other hurdles holding up a deal, analysts say.Softbank seems willing to let Deutsche Telekom have a majority stake and operational control in the combined company. Deutsche Telekom would consolidate the new company's earnings under that scenario.Another merger hurdle is valuation. Deutsche Telekom has no need to overpay for Sprint with its operational momentum. ""Sprint-T-Mobile remain far apart on what each other perceive the other to be worth,"" said a Cowen analyst in a report.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases.Sprint owns a big swath of 2.5 GHz radio spectrum.

1339,ADS,"As several thousand people file into the KeyArena in Seattle to cheer on their favorite players, the excitement builds. Contestants warm up, fans get charged, and broadcasters speculate breathlessly on what's about to take place.Once the action gets underway, the on-air commentators don't hold back their enthusiasm. At one point, the arena erupts in thunderous cheers when a rather conspicuous player occupying a patch of grass on the field of battle is suddenly blown to bits.""Get off my lawn,"" gushes the wry play-by-play man.A dystopian nightmare? Far from it. It's the International Dota 2 Championship for video-game players, known as ""the Super Bowl of esports,"" all captured for posterity on YouTube. And that ill-fated contestant was an animated character in the game.Some might scoff, but it's no joke — esports are growing up fast. They've been touted as the next big thing in professional sports, attracting millions of young fans and threatening the likes of sporting titans like the National Football League and National Basketball Association — both of which are suffering from declining viewership. At stake for video-game publishers is a potentially lucrative new business that could generate billions in advertising, sponsorships, ticket sales, broadcast rights and related business.Backers of esports believe that the world of professional competitive video games will eventually yield Michael Jordan-level stars that fans will idolize and try to emulate. More than 40 players have racked up earnings in excess of $1 million each from esports tournaments so far. There's even talk about adding esports competitions to the 2024 Olympics in Paris.To be sure, though, video games are not your typical spectator sport.At the recent ""Dota 2"" gathering in Seattle, held in August, the teams of actual live humans operated in relative anonymity behind glass fortresses — an occasional camera shot might have focused on a tense-looking player.Most of the attention, though, went to the spectacular hologram characters selected in an ersatz draft for the coming battle, played out on large video screens over the center stage. Spectators watched the action on a large stage for a prize pool worth $24.8 million. The winners, Europe-based Team Liquid, took home the top prize of $10.8 million, besting a team called Newbee.The hype around esports reached new heights in July as Activision Blizzard (ATVI) started selling teams in its new Overwatch League for a reported $20 million each.The idea of competitive video games as a sport is bound to strike many adults of a certain age as odd. Players sit at PCs or game consoles and control the on-screen action with hand controllers or keyboards and mice. Quick thinking and fast hand-eye coordination are traits of the best esports ""athletes.""""People have yet to legitimize gaming as a credible pastime,"" Benchmark analyst Mike Hickey said. ""It's like the argument over whether golf is a real sport.""But indications are that many young people would rather watch online gaming competitions than traditional sports like football, basketball and soccer. Esports games range from military-strategy shooter games and fantasy role-playing combat games to simulations of real-world sports.""Kids like to watch esports, whether they're players or not,"" Hickey said. And the youthful demographic is highly sought after by advertisers, who have trouble reaching that age group through traditional ads.Esports is ""a big deal,"" Hickey said.Research firm Newzoo predicts that the global audience for esports will reach 385 million this year, made up of 191 million esports enthusiasts plus 194 million occasional viewers. Most of their viewing takes place online. The Asia-Pacific region is expected to account for 51% of the esports enthusiasts this year, with North America making up 13%.Newzoo is forecasting the esports audience to reach 589 million worldwide in 2020, with 51% of those being core esports enthusiasts.Newzoo estimates that the esports market will generate $696 million in sales this year, up 41% from 2016. Of that, sponsorships will account for 38% of revenue, followed by advertising with 22%, game publisher fees at 17%, media rights taking in 14% and merchandise and tickets ringing up 9%.Esports revenue is seen rising to $1.49 billion in 2020, according to Newzoo. But that big number is fragmented by different games and tournament organizers.Companies best positioned to capitalize on the growing esports trend are those that own the games being played, analysts say.The leading publishers in esports now are Activision, Tencent (TCEHY)-owned Riot Games with ""League of Legends,"" and privately held Valve with ""Counter-Strike: Global Offensive"" and ""Dota 2.""Santa Monica, Calif.-based Activision owns the ""Overwatch,"" ""Starcraft,"" ""Hearthstone"" and ""Call of Duty"" franchises, which are already popular in competitive gaming.While Valve allows other companies to run competitions featuring its games, Activision, Tencent's Riot and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) are seeking to manage all aspects of esports with their games.On July 12, Activision announced the sale of the first seven team franchises in its upcoming Overwatch League, which is billed as the first major global professional esports league with city-based teams. Those new teams will be based in Boston, New York, Miami-Orlando, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Shanghai and Seoul.On Sept. 20, it completed the first season lineup of 12 city-based teams. It added teams in London, Philadelphia, Dallas and Houston, plus a second team in Los Angeles. The inaugural season for the new arena-based league begins Jan. 10, with preseason matches starting Dec. 6.Meanwhile, Riot Games announced in June that it will franchise the North American League of Legends Championship Series starting in 2018, with teams becoming permanent partners.And Take-Two has launched the NBA 2K esports league with the National Basketball Association. In May, the league announced that 17 NBA teams will participate in the inaugural season, set to debut in 2018.While some video-game publishers like Activision view esports as a significant new revenue stream, others like Electronic Arts (EA) view it as mostly a promotional tool to sell more games and downloadable content.""Esports is going to be an important part of most large-scale video games going forward,"" Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said. ""It's a great way to create more usage and engagement with games.""Plus, esports tournaments offer ""real revenue-generating opportunities on their own,"" he said.In the past, video games mirrored the movie business, with titles generating the bulk of their revenue in a short period of time. Now games can generate significant revenue for years through downloadable content, online services and esports, DFC Intelligence analyst David Cole said.Esports communities can keep a game relevant for a long period of time, Cole said.Most esports tournament viewing is online today through services like Amazon.com (AMZN)-owned Twitch and Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned YouTube. Traditional broadcasters have joined the fray as well, including Walt Disney's (DIS) ESPN and Time Warner's (TWX) Turner Broadcasting. Esports promoters hope to grow the audience for watching competitive gaming in person at arena events, some of which already draw thousands of fans for tournaments.One open question is whether esports fans will take to following the city-based teams proposed by Activision for ""Overwatch"" and Take-Two for ""NBA 2K.""Much of esports viewing centers on major championships for games, not run-of-the-mill matches.Also, esports activity around the top games developed organically over many years, while Activision and Take-Two are trying to drive the esports aspect of their games.""League of Legends"" generates the most online viewership in video games today, getting about 40% to 50% of viewers for competitions and instructional videos, Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. ""Dota 2"" and ""CS:GO"" are the next two biggest. ""Overwatch,"" released in May 2016, is fourth, with perhaps 10% of online viewership, Pachter said.The top three games are compelling to watch, while science-fiction shooter game ""Overwatch"" for now isn't, he said. The same goes for Take-Two's pro basketball video game, Pachter said.""EA and Take-Two talk about their sports simulation games,"" Pachter said. ""But the problem is we can already watch real athletes play real sports, so why would we want to watch video gamers play simulated sports?""Analysts will be closely watching the rollout of the Overwatch and NBA 2K leagues to see if they live up to the hype.""The indications seem to be very positive at this point,"" Sebastian said.RELATED:Activision Blizzard Earns Kudos For 'Overwatch' E-Sports MovesThese 3 Stocks Are Plays On The Fast-Growing E-Sports Market

Over that time a year earlier, arrivals from China tourists were up 7.3%.The Macau Government Tourism Office had expected a 5% increase in visits during the holiday this year, according to a Barclays research note published this week.

1359,ADS,"Index stock mutual funds as a group got net inflow in August. Actively run stock funds had outflow. The contrast was a $23.5 billion outflow for actively run funds on average vs. a $5 billion inflow for passive funds, according to Morningstar Direct. But the bulk of individual funds drawing the most inflow were actively managed.XThat's strong evidence that while many fund shareholders are seeking the low costs of passively managed funds, many also want funds that outperform the broad market. Thanks to holdings like e-commerce powerhouse Alibaba Group (BABA), IT security systems provider Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) and Chinese internet portal Sina (SINA), 10 of the 13 stock mutual funds with the largest net inflow in August and which are open to all investors were actively managed.All but two of the 13 outperformed the S&P 500 this year through Sept. 27, according to Morningstar Direct.The popularity of actively run portfolios extends deeper down the ranks of stock mutual funds. Twenty of the 25 with the largest August net inflows are actively run. Thirteen of the 20 outperformed the S&P 500.Alibaba and Sina are both held by $4.5 billion Delaware Emerging Markets Fund (DEMIX), whose $336.2 million in August net inflow ranked sixth best among all stocks funds that are open to new investors.Both stocks are members of the IBD 50 list of stocks that have strong relative price strength and fundamentals.Also, both are in IBD's 85-85 index. The index tracks stocks whose EPS and Relative Strength Ratings are 85 or greater, and whose prices are above $15, are within 15% of their 52-week high and whose average daily trading volume is 10,000 shares or more.In addition, Alibaba is in IBD's New America Index, which tracks the stocks of all companies covered in the New America feature for six months. As IBD's Brian Deagon explained in the Sept. 8 New America story, Alibaba has expanded into new fields, including groceries with its Hema supermarket chain. It has also expanded into digital entertainment and movies, financial services and cloud computing, among other businesses.Alibaba is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Retail-Internet industry group. And the e-commerce giant has an A SMR Rating. That means it's in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.Like Alibaba, Sina has a 99 Composite Rating from IBD. That's the highest possible Comp Rating. Scored on a scale of 1 to 99, stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.Sina is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Internet-Content industry group thanks to traits like a top-notch Comp Rating.After growing earnings 1,350% and 159% the past two quarters, consensus among analysts is that the stock's earnings per share will zoom up 109% this year.IBD'S TAKE: You can see how Sina's other fundamental and technical traits stack up against its peers' in IBD's easy-to-understand Stock Checkup.Sina has rallied since Sept. 25 when it pulled back along with other China internet stocks, after government regulators fined three social-media platforms for violating a new cybersecurity law.Check Point Software is held by $3.7 billion Lazard International Equity Portfolio Institutional Shares (LZIEX), whose $1.02 billion August inflow topped all other stock mutual funds that are open to all investors.Check Point's return on equity is 23.3% and has climbed for three years in a row.Shares are near 116, which is within their buy range from a 114.50 buy point of a cup-with-handle base.Like its Computer Software-Security industry group, the stock has been trending higher amid news of the Equifax data breach.The stock has a 91 Comp Rating and an A SMR Rating.Its EPS has grown for four years in a row.

Also understand that the most recent consolidation is a later-stage base, which makes it riskier to establish a new position or add shares to an existing one. While revenue growth fell last quarter from 48% to 23%, earnings-per-share grew 238%, up from 109% in the prior report.

1385,ADS,"AstraZeneca (AZN) and Tesaro (TSRO) stocks were in a slump Tuesday, a day after an institute doubted the cost-effectiveness of their drugs, known as PARP inhibitors, in ovarian cancer.XBut RBC analyst Kennen MacKay called the negative report from the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review ""myopic"" and argued that its conclusions wouldn't have a significant impact on market uptake or reimbursement for the drugs.""We see (Monday's) pullback in PARP inhibitor stocks following ICER's pharmaco-economic report on the PARP class as largely unjustified,"" he wrote in a note to clients. Clovis Oncology (CLVS) closed down 2.5% and Tesaro lost 1.8% on the report.By the closing bell on the stock market today, though, Clovis advanced 2.9% to finish at 82.67 while AstraZeneca was nearly flat at 34.26 and Tesaro fell 1.9% to 124.40. Broadly, the No. 2-ranked  biotech sector lost a fraction.MacKay views PARP inhibitors are ""transformative"" in the ovarian cancer market. But ICER's report suggested the trio of drugs would need to be significant discounted, 50%-78%, to align with their potential benefit for patients.The sole exception to ICER's finding was Lynparza used to treat patients with a mutated gene who've already responded to chemotherapy. In that setting, Lynparza fell in line with ICER's acceptable cost-effectiveness threshold.Zejula costs $9,833 a month for a 200-milligram dose, but the label recommends the starting dose at 300 milligrams. At that dose, Zejula would cost $14,749.50 each month, or $176,994 for a year. ICER lists the wholesale acquisition prices of Lynparza and Rubraca at $13,679 and $13,940 per month, or a respective $164,148 and $167,280 per year.IBD'S TAKE: Clovis scored an upgrade to its IBD Relative Strength Rating in September, rising to 92 from 88. Today, it has a 94 rating. Head to IBD Data Stories for more on what helped spike the stock.Payers will likely support the class of PARP inhibitors, MacKay argued. He noted that before their entry to the market, ovarian cancer therapy centered on chemotherapy which diminished in efficiency upon re-treatment, caused multiple side effects and proved inconvenient.""We see the PARP inhibitor class as a novel breakthrough in the treatment of ovarian cancer, and anticipate U.S. payers will continue to provide reimbursement,"" he said.This could become more complicated as Lynparza, Rubraca and Zejula gain similar approvals to treat specific populations of ovarian cancer patients, but as it stands payers don't prefer one agent to the detriment of another, MacKay said.ICER argued trial data haven't yet shown PARP inhibitors to have a benefit on overall survival, and some studies haven't compared them to alternative therapies. MacKay called this ""myopic,"" noting PARP inhibitors have shown a benefit on progression-free survival.""Given the robust nature of the Phase 3 progression-free data sets from all three PARP inhibitors as second maintenance treatments in ovarian cancer, we expect overall survival to read out in a similarly beneficial manner,"" he said.RELATED:How Two Drugmakers Will Benefit On AstraZeneca's CoattailsTesaro Beats Sales Views But Losses Up; Nektar Misses On Both CountsHow Dow's Merck Is Benefiting On The Backs Of AstraZeneca, Bristol

The companies agreed to split 50-50 legal and regulatory liabilities from those hacks.""Subsequent to Yahoo's acquisition by Verizon, and during integration, the company recently obtained new intelligence and now believes, following an investigation with the assistance of outside forensic experts, that all Yahoo user accounts were affected by the August 2013 theft,"" Verizon said in a release.

1387,ADS,"Never count out Mylan (MYL), an analyst said Wednesday, after the Food and Drug Administration approved its generic versions of Teva Pharmaceutical's (TEVA) Copaxone, a multiple sclerosis drug — setting shares of the two companies on vastly divergent paths.XBy the close of trading on the stock market today, Mylan had spiked 16.2% to 37.80. Teva, meanwhile, plunged 14.6% to 16.08. Analysts largely hadn't expected the FDA to approve generic Copaxone until 2018.The approvals were for a 20-milligram daily dose and for 40-milligram shots three times per week. The 40-milligram approval is the first generic at that dose. Novartis' (NVS) Sandoz and Momenta Pharmaceuticals (MNTA) got approval for a 20-milligram daily Copaxone generic, Glatopa, in 2015.Mylan also announced a patient support service dubbed Mylan MS Advocate to help ease patients off branded Copaxone and to its generics with an interactive mobile app, in-home injection training, a 24/7 call center, copay assistance for eligible patients and support from a nurse experienced at treating MS.Analysts were widely surprised at the approvals, which came on the heels of fresh comments from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb to Bloomberg regarding the need to speed generic drug approvals to spur competition and reduce drug prices.""Bottom line, this is incrementally positive for Mylan while for Teva both a negative surprise and a cash flow hit to 2018,"" RBC analyst Randall Stanicky wrote in a note to clients. He reiterated his underperform rating on Teva stock.Teva called the impending launch by Mylan ""at-risk,"" meaning the rival generic drugmaker could be subject to damages and other remedies pending the outcomes of appeals decisions and other patent litigation.In one case, Teva is arguing against a December 2016 decision by the Patent Trial Appeal Board that found all claims from three Copaxone patents were invalid. Teva also is arguing against a January decision in district court that invalidated the claims of four patents covering Copaxone.The firm also is suing five companies, including Mylan, claiming they infringed on a patent covering the manufacturing process for Copaxone. All five companies are working to bring generic copies of the MS drug to the market.IBD'S TAKE: Teva has a poor IBD Composite Rating of 7 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it performs in the bottom 7% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. See better-rated drug stocks via IBD Stock Checkup.Teva expects Mylan's generic launch to eat 25 cents earnings per share in the fourth quarter ending Dec. 31. RBC's Stanicky noted Teva had previously predicted one or two generics could lead to $1 billion to $1.3 billion in annual revenue downside and a $1 hit to per-share earnings.""Teva previously guided to slow Copaxone deterioration due to the stickiness of its patient support program which could play out initially,"" he wrote. However, Mylan's patient support program ""should drive more switching over time.""Consensus numbers project 9% erosion to Teva's Copaxone in the fourth quarter and a decline of 39% in 2018, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat wrote in a note to clients. He expects Teva to ""have to dig deeper for additional cost cuts to offset some of this.""BTIG analyst Timothy Chiang models Mylan bringing in $425 million to $450 million in generic Copaxone sales in the first 12 months following its launch, assuming generic pricing is a 35%-40% discount to the branded drug and Mylan can grab 25%-30% of market share.""We believe the company gaining approval on both strengths of Copaxone not only validates Mylan's core competency as a premier generics company, it also provides an important signal to investors that one can simply never count out Mylan — especially in the area of complex generic products,"" he said.Chiang kept his buy rating on Mylan stock and boosted his price target to 45 from 42.Mylan, in a news release, said it and other first filers could be eligible for 180 days of generic drug exclusivity, but noted that the FDA hadn't yet made a formal determination on that. In the 12 months ended July 31, both strengths of Copaxone brought in $4.34 billion in sales, the firm said.The approvals could be a negative for other entrants, like Momenta and Novartis' Sandoz which are working on getting approval for a 40-milligram version of Copaxone. In February, the duo got a warning letter from the FDA which detailed issues at manufacturer Pfizer's (PFE) fill-finish plant.Momenta stock plunged 13.7% to 15.10 in response to Mylan's approvals.Payers are likely to also put pressure on Biogen (BIIB) to lower the prices of its MS drugs, RBC analyst Brian Abrahams wrote in a research report. In 2016, the six-drug suite brought in just shy of $9 billion in sales.""We believe this highlights the need for Biogen to concede price or share as multiple new generics and branded therapies enter the market in the coming years (especially in a space that does not have high intrinsic growth),"" he wrote.Abrahams estimates Biogen reporting $9 billion in MS drug sales in 2017, but declining 17% by 2025 to $7.6 billion. He noted ""these declines could be higher if payers get more aggressive."" Biogen stock dipped 0.8% to 314.92 in response.RELATED:Generic Drug Makers Face Pricing Issues That Other Pharmas Don'tBiotechs Find Strength In Numbers In Treating Multiple SclerosisHow Roche's 'Game Changer' Drug Will Chip Away At Biogen, Novartis

1392,ADS,"With a year-to-date return of over 29.34%, Columbia Select Large Cap Growth Fund (UMLGX) is poised to end the year on a high note — doubling the performance of its Russell 1000 Growth benchmark and nearly doubling the S&P 500's 16.07% as of Oct. 16.This year's solid performance comes after a volatile 2016 full of macroeconomic events — like Brexit and the U.S. presidential election. Fund manager Thomas Galvin said the market has finally recalibrated its valuations for the type of quality growth stocks that the fund seeks, particularly in the technology and health care sectors. This has helped drive the fund's stellar performance.XQuality growth stocks are financially strong companies with compelling fundamental stories.The fund, comanaged by Richard Carter and Todd Herget, weights positions in its holdings based on the fund managers' level of conviction in the company. The conviction-weighted portfolio represents the management team's best ideas that could lead to significant price appreciation.The fund has seen significant success this year with high sector weightings in health care, technology and consumer cyclical. But in the latest reported quarter — as of Aug. 31 — the fund is reducing some of its exposure to the tech and health care sectors.As of Aug. 31, the fund had positions in 33 names. Of those 33 stocks, the IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner has made strong bets on two FANG stocks — Facebook (FB) and Amazon.com (AMZN) — and China-based Alibaba (BABA), amounting to almost 13% of the overall portfolio. These three firms are representative of the fund's search for high-quality secular growth stories.Facebook exemplifies what Galvin is looking for in companies, touting 17 consecutive better-than-expected quarterly earnings results and global brand awareness. Facebook's main site, Instagram and WhatsApp have unmatched global scale and allow precise targeting for advertisers.In the latest quarter, year-over-year earnings increased 69%, while revenue bumped up 45%. Looking forward to the current quarter — to be reported on Nov. 1 after the market close — analysts expect the firm's earnings to rise 42% on a 40% increase in sales.The social media giant moved past its 129.37 cup-with-handle buy point on Jan. 24 and never looked back. At its July 27 peak, the stock had advanced over 52% year to date. Now, the IBD 50 stock has formed a flat base with a 175.59 buy point. Shares are less than 3% away from the entry in the stock market today.The ""Amazon Effect"" has seen Amazon expand into a multitude of industries, including grocery stores with the late-summer acquisition of Whole Foods Market. Amazon is in the process of radically disrupting and transforming the e-commerce industry, to the benefit of its shareholders.Up until late July, Amazon was a top performing large-cap growth stock in 2017. On Feb. 16, the stock broke out above an 843.94 cup-with-handle entry. From there, the stock advanced as much as 28% to its record high on July 27.After suffering an earnings setback on that day — quarterly earnings declined 78% year over year — the stock would go on to fall 14% from its record high on Sept. 26 before rebounding. Now, the stock has gotten back above the 1,000 price level, and is forming a potential flat base with a 1083.41 buy point.Meanwhile, the fund also has an over-4% position in China-based e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA). Alibaba has been one of the top leading growth stocks of 2017, rising more than 75% from a 104.67 classic cup-with-handle buy point. The stock pulled back to is 50-day moving average Monday, where it's testing support. It's 2.3% below a 177.10 ascending-base entry.Into the end of the year, the fund managers remain optimistic about chances that the fund will close out the year strongly. Galvin believes that unless there is an economic recession lurking around the corner, the market will continue to drift higher. Global economic growth and strong U.S. employment — the jobless rate is at a 16 year low — should create more upside potential for profit growth, leading to higher equity prices. However, the Nasdaq has already risen almost 23% this year, so potential upside may be more limited.The technology sector should remain strong through Q3 earnings season. Despite the expectation of continued strength, the fund has been reducing positions in that sector due to natural profit-taking.The fund is overweight in the consumer cyclical sector with Tractor Supply (TSCO) one of its newly added positions.Tractor Supply has rebounded in recent months after hitting multiyear lows in July 2017, but no proper buy point has emerged.RELATED:Looking For Top-Performing Mutual Funds?

1396,ADS,"If you only had a day to get a sense of where Facebook (FB) stands with Wall Street and the nation, you might look no further than Wednesday.XThe multibillion-dollar, compulsively checked social-media platform is set to report third-quarter earnings on Nov. 1. But the real drama that day could come out of Washington, D.C., where Facebook's general counsel is set to face lawmakers eager to learn the extent to which Russia might have exploited the company to agitate the nation's cultural divides and troll last year's presidential election.The events likely will revive a bigger debate about whether Facebook should be thought of as a media powerhouse-to-be rather than a tech icon, and whether it needs to be the former for its stock to continue its galactic rise. Analysts interviewed for this story argue that Facebook is more of a tech company, saying that it doesn't create content on its site. Instead, its core product is its strata of algorithms and artificial intelligence, they say.They add that Facebook doesn't need to crank out the original TV shows or other features on which fellow FANG stocks Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon.com (AMZN) have banked.""I'm not sure that's why I want to go to Facebook,"" Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said. ""I do want to go to Facebook to have my friends tell me 'Blade Runner 2049' is good.""Those in the Facebook-is-a-media-company camp, however, might point to its financials. Digital ad sales are expected to drive a 41% surge in revenue in the third quarter. Any financial outlook that the company offers for next year could be tempered by its decision to hire 1,000 people to vet those ads, after Kremlin-linked accounts allegedly planted thousands of them in an attempt to inflame tensions in the U.S. around wedge issues.In addition, they might argue, the company offers video content from Major League Baseball, the National Football League and National Public Radio. It recently put up an unsuccessful $610 million bid for the rights to broadcast Indian Premier League cricket games. And lots of people get their news, real or fake, from the site.Many observers say a company that does all that should own up to the responsibilities and regulations that cover the rest of the media business.But would a play for more media be good for Wall Street? Analysts say that creating or buying media content itself could gut Facebook's margins and the investor excitement that has helped its stock more than quadruple since its splashy initial public offering in 2012.""There are so many other growth opportunities ahead of the company, we doubt it would have to have media become a major piece of the story,"" SunTrust analyst Youssef Squali said.The company's longer-term opportunities include augmented reality, in video games or even distance learning. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg wants to develop glasses that digitally impose objects over the user's actual surroundings and, in effect, declutter the world of physical objects.""You want to play a board game? You snap your fingers, and here's the board game,"" he said, according to a Recode story this year. ""You don't need a physical hardware TV, you buy a one-dollar app 'TV' and put it on the wall.""There's also a lot more room for Facebook's Messenger and Whatsapp messaging platforms to tack moneymaking widgets onto the messages that users already send to one another. Mention a location and that could trigger a bot from Uber that would allow you to arrange a ride through Messenger.Others say there's a chance for those services to be more like WeChat, the multifaceted messaging service based in China.""That's not just a text messaging app, it's a payment app, it's a commerce app. You can do a lot of different things,"" Edward Jones analyst Josh Olson said. ""It's really a platform in and of itself.""IBD'S TAKE: Facebook touched a buy zone out of a flat base in the middle of October but has since retreated and is near its 50-day moving average. Still, it remains second in IBD's Internet-Content Group, right behind No. 1-ranked YY.He adds that Facebook has a long way to go before it fully mines its own assets — Whatsapp, Messenger and the photo-sharing site Instagram — for sales and profit.How about what's already making money for Facebook? Start with site's roughly 2 billion monthly users, or somewhere around half the people on the internet. People spend close to an hour, and counting, each day within the Facebook infrastructure. That's thanks in part to the slow drip of birthday and event reminders — and the bump that comes from being notified of an abrasive comment or a 'Like' — that keep people on the site.The more people use the site, the better Facebook can serve up precise consumer analytics for advertisers across its core site and its other platforms.""They've got close to half of the users of the internet on their platform, and they can target them with scary accuracy,"" Olson said.With size, accuracy and familiarity come trust. Sixty-six percent of respondents to an RBC/Ad Age marketer survey in September said they planned to increase their ad budget with Facebook. The percentage was 63% for Instagram.That beats Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, Google's YouTube, Amazon, Snap's (SNAP) Snapchat or Twitter (TWTR).With the exception of tweeting, Facebook also has adopted features similar to those on other social media sites. You can send money and order food.Instagram's Stories feature, in which users stitch together photographed and recorded things that happen to them during the day, largely does what Snapchat does. Pachter called Instagram Stories a good ""defense"" against Snapchat.""That keeps 40-year-old women from befriending their kids on Snapchat,"" he said.But as more moms storm Facebook's news feeds, a recent survey from Piper Jaffray found that ""the youngest of teens are simply not adopting"" the platform, favoring the more photo-and-video-centric Instagram and Snapchat.The company this year continues to invest, hiring engineers and building out data centers, which is keeping operating expenses elevated. And its advertising technology has been porous enough for some major errors.By midday Friday, shares of Facebook were up 3.4% to near 176.40 on the stock market today.Since last year, reports have also surfaced that Facebook overestimated how long people watched its videos or it otherwise miscalculated user engagement with marketers and publishers.Then there's the matter of Russia, which has compromised the trust of the public and, to an extent, investors. But analysts say any regulatory consequences — Facebook might have to provide more information about who's behind a political ad — would be minimal on a financial level.More significant financially, they say, is the possibility of antitrust action and scrutiny in Europe over privacy protections. Facebook and Google dominate the digital ad landscape; how the companies use consumers' data has been a concern in Europe for years.Facebook's ability to expand globally remains one of its biggest advantages. Most of its daily active users access the site through a mobile device and, outside of first-world nations, the phone is ""often the first (or only) connected screen,"" Needham analysts said a research note in October.But analysts' views are mixed over whether Facebook can tap the largest economy outside the U.S.: China. And any move into China would follow Russia's own infiltration of the social network.""I think the last thing the Chinese government wants is to have some kind of rogue platform that they can't control,"" Squali said.RELATED:How Does Facebook Compare To Amazon, Netflix And Google?Here's What Facebook Messenger Can Do For Your Stock PortfolioCould Facebook Virtual Reality Spending Hit $5 Billion A Year?FANG Stocks News & Quotes: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google

1397,ADS,"For an education on China-based Sina (SINA), consider the similarities between it and longtime internet presence Yahoo.XBoth are pioneering but aging web portals. The two also have been targeted by activist investors seeking to shake up their board of directors and ignite major changes.In Yahoo's case, its crown jewel was a big stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA). Sina, meanwhile, controls social media firm Weibo (WB), whose Twitter- and Instagram-like app has 361 million users. Weibo's advertising revenue has boomed as it cashes in on hosting accounts from most of the country's pop stars, and it has served as Sina's bread-and-butter.Indeed, Weibo shares have shot up 144% in 2017. Sina stock has jumped 108%, partly due to its controlling stake in fast-growing Weibo and speculation that activist investor Aristeia Capital could win its proxy fight vs. Sina, in which it calls for a sale of the company or a divestiture of Weibo.""We estimate that Sina's stock price could go up by 15% to 45% if it potentially adopts the proposal raised by Aristeia,"" JPMorgan said in a note to clients.Aristeia also has proposed a complete spinoff of Weibo to Sina shareholders or a bigger stock buyback. Shanghai-based Sina spun out Weibo in 2014 but still consolidates its financials in earnings. Sina owns 46% of Weibo and controls 72% of voting power.There are some big differences between Yahoo and Sina, though. Starboard Value, the activist investor that targeted Yahoo, succeeded in forcing the sale of its core internet business to Verizon Communications (VZ). But U.S.-based hedge fund Aristeia faces an uphill battle in China, where proxy battles launched by foreign shareholders are rare.Sina holds its annual meeting on Nov. 3, where all shareholders will vote on Aristeia's proposal. The sale of Sina would come at a premium delivered to a third-party buyer. Alibaba looms as a candidate because it owns a 31% stake in Weibo. Another buyer could be Qihoo 360 (QIHU), the security software maker, analysts say.Sina management could make a counteroffer before the Nov. 3 meeting. So far, though, management has argued that Aristeia shouldn't have too much say in the company's direction, because it only holds a 4.2% stake.Aristeia would control 30% of Sina's board, if it expands to seven from five members. Aristeia is pursuing a ""short-term and self-serving agenda,"" Sina management said in a letter to shareholders.Another Aristeia proposal is a reverse merger in which Weibo would acquire Sina. But analysts see few synergies in recombining the two companies.Excluding Weibo, Sina doesn't have a growth engine. Sina's news portal is still popular, with 64 million  users, but it's unprofitable. On the plus side, its advertising revenue is expected to fall only 2% in 2017 compared with a 10% drop last year. Most non-Weibo ad revenue comes from online payments.Sina has leveraged Weibo to gain mobile users of its news app. But it faces keen competition from Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), Baidu (BIDU)  and others. In a blow, Chinese news aggregator Toutiao recently severed its links with Sina and Weibo. Toutiao owns the popular Today's Headlines service.One bright spot is internet finance, though revenue is still small, says Zhang Xueru, an analyst at 86 Research. Founded in 2009, Sina has dabbled in finance since late 2013.Sina aims to expand into microloans, online banking and online brokerage businesses. In the July quarter, ""online finance bore fruit after cultivation of this business over the past few years,"" said a Goldman Sachs report.Sina has created a $500 million fund for investing in internet-finance-related startups.Sina also owns stakes in Tian Ge, an online karaoke company and Leju, an online real estate broker. Sina also has invested in Yixia Technology, a developer of video apps for Weibo.Weibo's June-quarter revenue jumped 72% to $253.4 million from a year earlier, while earnings per share rose 138% to 38 cents. Weibo had been slow to put advertisements inside social streams over concerns that ads would turn off users. In the June quarter, advertisers reached 880,000, up 13% from the previous quarter.Weibo is readying a new advertising system that analysts expect to boost revenue in 2018. The new system consolidates Weibo's services and products and lets advertisers bid for ad slots.IBD'S TAKE: Sina has stayed mostly above a buy point reached in early August and has hovered above the buy zone since early September. Weibo, meanwhile, has been in a flat base since early September and is targeting a 108.40 buy point. The new system will also enable Weibo to provide targeted ads based on user data.Weibo's main rival has been Tencent's mobile messaging service WeChat, called Weixin in Chinese, whose users will top 490 million in 2017, says eMarketer. Weibo has told analysts it's aiming for 400 million monthly users by the end of 2017. Weibo is using partnerships with mobile phone makers to sign up new users in second- and third-tier cities in rural areas.""WeChat and Weibo are two different social platforms,"" said Zhang at 86 Research, in an interview. ""They've evolved to fill distinctive needs, with different user bases.""Many Weibo users are looking for entertainment and gossip news. Most of the country's movie stars, singers and other celebrities use Weibo accounts for publicity. Weibo users can buy gifts for celebrities through Weibo's online payment system.Similar to YouTube, controlled by Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google unit, Weibo allows users to post short videos. Weibo introduced livestreaming for users in mid-2016, borrowing a tack from Facebook (FB) and Twitter's Periscope. Pop stars are among the livestreamers.Karen Chan, a Jefferies analyst, expects revenue upside for Weibo in 2018 from its partnership with livestreaming specialist Yizhibo. Weibo users can view Yizhibo livestreams and videos and interact with its broadcasters. Yizhibo competes with Momo (MOMO).There's also Weibo Stories, launched in April. It's similar to Facebook Stories and allows Weibo users to share photos and videos with followers. The content disappears after 24 hours.  An HSBC report says 10% of Weibo users are already sharing content monthly.""Rich content is what differentiates Weibo from other social platforms,"" said Jialong Shi, an Instinet/Nomura analyst in a report.Sina shares dipped 1% Friday to close at 110.48 while Weibo was off 1.5% to finish at 95.48.RELATED:Sogou, Mobile Search Rival Of Baidu And Alibaba, Files For IPOThe Spigots Are Expected To Open Soon For This Energy ExplorerSquare Snares Sellers With Sticky Services In Financial TechMomo Is On Fire, Thanks To The Kindness Of Strangers

1412,ADS,"With the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq composite and Dow industrials setting new highs again in a choppy market, several stocks that struggled with breakouts are back in buy zones. Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) retook an entry point Tuesday. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) is trying to find its footing, though its chart isn't so simple. As for Apple's fellow Dow techs, Microsoft (MSFT) keeps bouncing around a buy point, Intel (INTC) continues to rally and Cisco Systems (CSCO) sets up just below a possible entry.XFutures for the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 fell a fraction vs. fair value early Wednesday morning. Dow futures rose 0.1%.The Chinese internet giant on Sept. 13 cleared a 177.10 buy point from a rare ascending base. Over the next several sessions Alibaba hovered just above or below that entry. Then shares tumbled nearly 5% on Sept. 25 as many big-cap techs sold off hard. After sinking the following day, Alibaba had sunk 5.8% below the buy point. It would have been understandable for investors to get losses. But the breakout wasn't an outright failure, and Alibaba appeared to find support near its 10-week line.Over the next few sessions, Alibaba crept higher. On Tuesday, Alibaba rose 2.85% to 178.56, back above the 177.10 entry. Volume was weak.IBD'S TAKE: If the market pulls back after its recent run, Alibaba and other stocks just above entry points could easily slip back down. That latest Big Picture lays out the case for taking a defensive posture despite the major averages hitting all-time highs. The Big Picture and other subscriber-only features are open through Oct. 8.Apple shares cleared a 156.75 flat-base buy point on Aug. 2, following stronger-than-expected earnings. Shares largely held above that level for the next several weeks. But Apple then fell below that key level and the 50-day moving average on Sept. 20 amid concerns about sluggish iPhone 8 demand and iPhone X production issues. Apple continued to fall for the next four sessions, with all five declines in above-average volume. At its low point, Apple was nearly 5% below the old entry point.Since then, Apple has trended slightly higher, rising 0.4% to 154.48 on Tuesday. But Apple's old buy point was first cleared two months ago. Investors may want to wait for an emerging base to form — Apple has been consolidating for more than four weeks now. Alternatively, if Apple blasts above its 50-day moving average in strong volume, that would provide a buying opportunity. Apple's 50-day line is less than 1 point above the old 156.65 entry.Microsoft dipped 0.5% to 74.26 on Tuesday, ticking below its 74.52 buy point a day after retaking it. Microsoft snapped a five-day rebound from around the 50-day line, though all of those gains were in light volume. Microsoft has generally been slightly outpacing the S&P 500 for the past year or so, but in a gradual fashion. Microsoft will break out, often in light volume, then meander above or below the buy point, before setting up again in a new consolidation that's modestly above the prior one.Microsoft's fortunes have been revitalized by its cloud-computing push, where it's becoming a serious rival in some areas to Amazon and its Amazon Web Services unit.Intel cleared a 38.55 buy point on Monday from a flat base going back to late January, moving in strong volume. The chip giant, then rose 0.9% to 39.38 on Tuesday, hitting its highest level since late 2000. Because Intel has been going sideways for so many months, the stock has been a market laggard until very recently.Intel has gotten a recent boost from reports that Tesla (TSLA) will use its chips for its ""infotainment"" systems, replacing Nvidia (NVDA). Intel, helped by its Mobileye acquisition, is heavily involved in several autonomous driving efforts and alliances. Intel also has some chips in recent Apple iPhones.Cisco has been struggling to shift from its declining legacy hardware business of routers and switches to services and software, including cybersecurity. But actual growth has been hard to come by, and the stock's Relative Strength line has generally been lagging for the past eight years.But Cisco is working on the right side of a shallow cup base going back nearly five months. Shares rose 0.3% to 33.85 on Tuesday. Cisco now has a handle, giving it a 34.20 buy point, slightly lower than the prior potential entry of 34.70, just above the recent high.RELATED:The Big Picture: The Case For A Defensive StanceBlue-Chip Intel Rides The Chip Wave Higher, Nears Buy Point3 Chip Equipment Makers In Buy Range, Touching New HighsHow To Sit Tight In Great Stocks: How Long Should You Hold Your Winners?News And Analysis Of Dow Jones Industrial Average And Component StocksBest Chinese Stocks To Buy And Watch

1413,ADS,"Biohaven Pharmaceuticals (BHVN) continued its two-day free fall Tuesday after its rare-disease drug failed in a trial — prompting at least two analysts to downgrade the stock.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Biohaven plunged 7% to close at 33.08. That came on top of a 4.9% drop on Monday, during a session in which shares fell as hard as 28.7%.Morgan Stanley analyst Matthew Harrison cut his price target on Biohaven to 38 from 47, though kept his overweight rating. He notes data from a migraine trial expected to be unveiled in the first quarter of 2018 could send shares to the mid-50s.On Tuesday investors were still reeling from Phase 2 and Phase 3 data of a drug to treat a degenerative disease of the brain. The drug, trigriluzole, failed to improve impairment vs. a placebo in patients with the disease known as spinocerebellar ataxia at eight weeks.After eight weeks of treatment, patients treated with trigriluzole showed an improvement of -0.81 points vs. an improvement of -1.05 points for patients on a placebo. A higher score indicates greater impairment, Harrison said.The placebo results were higher than expected, Harrison wrote in a note to clients. He removed spinocerebellar ataxia from his model on Biohaven. Previously, Harrison had expected a 75% chance of success for the program and $315 million in peak adjusted sales.IBD'S TAKE: Medtech stocks have broadly risen this year as concerns over drug pricing have sent some biotech and pharma investors for the hills.

Despite the charge, the aerospace giant raised full year cash flow outlook and its full-year core EPS to $9.90-$10.10 from a prior view of $9.80-$10.00. But the EPS midpoint is still under analyst views. Boeing's Q3 EPS fell 22.5% to $2.72, but topped forecasts for $2.65, while revenue rose 1.7% to $24.31 billion, above estimates.

Rival AMD delivered better-than-expected third-quarter results, but disappointed with its guidance for a flat gross profit margin in the current quarter. The biggest loser was Ultra Clean, which plummeted 21% on Thursday after mixed third-quarter results.RELATED:Intel Beats Third-Quarter Goals, Guides HigherGeneral Motors' (GM) Q3 EPS fell 23% to $1.32 as revenue shrank 21% to $33.62 billion, amid a broad slowdown in U.S. car sales, a planned reduction in fleet sales, and a retreat from certain European, African and Asian markets.

The payment volume growth was strong in countries like Russia, India and Australia and came despite worries over the state of U.S. retail, a Mizuho analyst noted.T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Sprint (S) called off earnings calls to avoid M&A discussion, raising speculation that a merger announcement between them could come in November, despite regulatory hurdles. T-Mobile added 595,000 postpaid phone subscribers in the September quarter, while Sprint added 279,000.  AT&T (T) lost 97,000 as it reported flat profit and a 3% revenue drop. AT&T says it expects the $85 billion purchase of Time Warner (TWX) to close by year end. Some analysts say the sell-off in AT&T was related to equity dilution expected from the TWX deal. AT&T is issuing stock to finance half of the deal. On the plus side, analysts say all four carriers, including No. 1 Verizon (VZ), have been restrained in promotions for the soon-to-be released high-end Apple (AAPL) iPhone X, which could improve margins for the December quarter.Cable TV firms Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter (CHTR) reported higher video subscriber losses and lower broadband customer additions. Comcast had lowered guidance in early September, sending its stock down 10% ahead of Q3 earnings. Charter stock fell after it disclosed similar trends. The companies aim to hike prices on broadband services as video subscribers switch to Internet TV. Charter added 249,000 broadband customers vs. estimates of 335,000. Charter acquired Time Warner Cable last year. Comcast added 182,000 broadband customers in Q3 vs. 288,000 a year earlier.Baidu (BIDU) crushed third-quarter earnings estimates, but the Chinese search engine giant gave weak Q4 guidance.

1417,ADS,"The breakfasters at Bob and Edith's Diner are too preoccupied with their tasty bacon and eggs to notice the Democratic gubernatorial candidate. Or perhaps, like all Americans who are more sensitive than oysters, they are in the throes of political exhaustion and are trying to ignore this year's only competitive gubernatorial race.In any case, they seem unaware that the mild-mannered pediatric neurologist in one of the booths — he is wearing a bourgeois disguise: gray suit, maroon tie — supposedly is ""fighting for the violent MS-13 killer gangs"" involving many Central American immigrants. The U.S. president says so, as does the gubernatorial candidate of his party.In two weeks, Virginia will have America's most consequential election since 50 weeks ago. Then, this became the only Southern state Hillary Clinton carried (by 5 points). Today's campaign dramatizes the difficult calculation confronting people who want the Republican Party restored as a vehicle for conservatism but who know that this requires expunging the political style — exuberantly fact-free accusations and screeds — exemplified by the ""MS-13"" tweet.Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam won the Democratic nomination by handily defeating (by 10 points) a darling of the Bernie Sanders/Elizabeth Warren (both endorsed the darling) tendency in the Democratic primary, which attracted 177,000 more voters than the Republican primary did. Now, however, Northam is benefiting from his opponent's intractable dilemma, that of all Republicans who remember life before 2016 and want to do what they are told cannot be done: Turn the clock back. Virginia's incumbent Democratic governor, Terry McAuliffe, is popular. Virginia is purple trending blue: Democrats have carried it in three consecutive presidential races, they have won three of the last four gubernatorial contests and both U.S. senators are Democrats. Barack Obama has campaigned to energize African-American voters. And the Republican candidate, Ed Gillespie, has a problem residing across the Potomac.In 2014, Gillespie — former counselor to President George W. Bush, former Republican National Committee chair, advisor to Mitt Romney's campaign, lobbyist extraordinaire — came within a whisker (under 18,000 votes) of defeating an incumbent U.S. senator, Mark Warner. This year, however, Gillespie barely defeated a full-throated Trumpian in the Republican primary. Gillespie is intelligent, temperate, experienced and happiest when talking about government policies. These attributes are, in the incandescent eyes of his party's now-Trumpian base, defects of swamp creatures. So, he is gingerly tiptoeing across the treacherous terrain of Trumpian Republican politics. This involves stoking the anger of those people who seem happiest when furious, but without infuriating everyone else.He did the former with dishonest MS-13 ads featuring tattooed dark-skinned men (""Kill, rape, control."") and accusing Northam of refusing to crack down on ""sanctuary cities,"" of which Virginia has none. Gillespie's admirers say he is better than he sounds. Others, remembering Mark Twain (who popularized the quip ""Wagner's music is better than it sounds""), say that in democratic politics — the politics of persuasive rhetoric — a candidate is the way he chooses to sound.Recently, however, Gillespie has been stressing economic issues while Northam has been saturating liberal Northern Virginia with ads featuring women who are cross because Gillespie is pro-life. Never mind that governors have been almost irrelevant to abortion policy since courts took control of it two generations ago. Perhaps Northam's ads are intended to enkindle progressives, but that should be done by the president's daily reminders of his existence. If Gillespie enlists Trump to campaign for him, he will thereby embrace a political style that entails a political substance (e.g., harping on MS-13) suited to it. If he does not, Trump's supporters will notice and accuse him of having standards, yet another swampish vice — the stigmata of elitism.A Gillespie win on Nov. 7 would be a double victory for Republicans. They would control another swing-state's governor's mansion in 2020. And it might send the Sanders/Warren true believers careening off on a ""We told you so!"" rampage, arguing — convincingly only to other believers — that Virginians chose a conservative Republican because Northam, although progressive, was insufficiently so. Then they could continue making ""single-payer"" (government-dispensed) health care progressivism's central promise to a nation in which 157 million people happily get their health care plans from their employers.So, if Gillespie wins, Republicans elsewhere will conclude that the derangement of their party does not hinder its prospering. If the Democrat wins, many progressives will be secretly as unhappy as the Trumpians who, like those progressives, will argue that their man lost because he was inconsistently and insincerely enthusiastic about his party's most off-putting faction.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

1420,ADS,"With earnings on tap for Nov. 6, Credicorp (BAP) is trading about 3% shy of a 213.92 buy point. The entry is based on a second-stage flat base.X Keep in mind that jumping into a stock right as it gets ready to report means you likely won't have enough time to build a profit cushion before the release. That leaves you exposed to a sudden and perhaps sharp drop if the company falls short of analyst and investor expectations. You can reduce your exposure by waiting to see the actual numbers and the market's reaction. Looking For Winning Stocks? Try This Simple RoutineEarnings growth moved up last quarter from 14% to 19%, but sales fell from 10% to 4%. Analysts are looking for earnings growth of 3% for the quarter, and 10% growth for the full year. Earnings estimates for the full year were recently revised higher.

1421,ADS,"The S&P 500 index and other major averages hit fresh all-time highs last week. But Apple (AAPL), Alibaba (BABA) and recent FANG breakouts Facebook (FB) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are among the many stocks that continue to struggle to make much headway past buy points.XLike beached whales, some big-name stocks are making it to land, but then not going much of anywhere. Such stocks struggle to get off the beach, in danger of going underwater depending on the shifting market tides.That raises risks for investors, who have become complacent because they haven't suffered serious  negative consequences from sticking with the likes of Apple, Nvidia (NVDA) and other big names that suffered ugly post-breakout reversals.A lot of this reflects the general market. The S&P 500 index, like the other averages, has been grinding higher, with baby-step gains offset by shallow pullbacks. Individual names tend to follow the market, so breakouts occur during short-term upswings, leaving them vulnerable to the broader averages backing off for a time.S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures rose a fraction vs. fair value early Monday morning. So did Dow futures.Alphabet limped above a 1,006.29 flat-base buy point on Oct. 13 in below-average volume. Facebook topped a 175.59 flat-base entry last Tuesday. But they didn't really go anywhere. Thursday's modest Nasdaq declines help push both back underwater. Alphabet and Facebook both edged higher Friday but didn't re-enter buy zones.Alibaba (BABA) has been playing this game for weeks. The Chinese e-commerce giant on Sept. 13 cleared a 177.10 buy point from a rare ascending base, the stock has been above and below the entry. Alibaba dipped 0.3% on Friday to 177.32.Apple broke above a 156.75 flat-base buy point on Aug. 2, following a solid earnings report. Apple spent several weeks generally above level, but pulled back in September amid concerns about iPhone 8 demand and iPhone X production woes. The stock didn't quite fall enough to make the 156.75 entry invalid, though a high-volume tumble through its 50-day line didn't help.However, Apple found support and is now working on a new flat base with 165.04 entry. Apple did fall back below its 50-day on Thursday, closing at 156.25 on Friday.When one of these beached-whale breakouts just hovers by a buy point, you have very little cushion. You're at high risk of falling underwater due to modest moves stemming from the market, industry or company-specific reasons.Electronic Arts (EA) hung around a late July buy point for months. Then last week EA delayed a much-anticipated ""Star Wars"" video game. Shares slid 4.2%, hitting a three-month low. EA hasn't invalidated its old entry and it's in a new flat base, but it's frustrating to be sitting on little-or-no gain for months, then see your stock go into the red.But investors have been complacent about lackluster breakouts. The lack of significant market corrections has helped stocks quickly recover.Even with its significant sell-off, if you had bought Apple right at the old buy point, you're down less than 1%.In other cases, a stock shows ugly action but then rebounds for tidy gains. Nvidia is a great example.Nvidia broke out in mid-September and in two days had risen as much as 9.5% from the 174.66 buy point. But the stock then quickly reversed and erased all its gains and then some. Nvidia just avoided a 10% round trip that is an automatic sell signal. Investors certainly would have been justified at getting out of their position.But it turns out that Nvidia wasn't a beached whale but a land shark. Shares of the graphics and A.I. chipmaker turned around and rallied strongly. Nvidia closed Friday at 196.90, up nearly 13% from the buy point.For blasé investors in 2017, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is a cautionary tale. The burrito chain, back when it was still delivering double-digit same-store growth, broke out in January 2015. Shares hung around for a few weeks near the buy point, but then sold off over several months, correcting nearly 15%. But Chipotle soon rebounded and cleared a new base in July 2015. Shares traded above or below that entry point until October, when it began to plunge over widespread food-borne illness outbreaks.

1424,ADS,"Major indexes staged mild gains in afternoon trade Tuesday, bullishly holding on to Monday's strong advance in the wake of Hurricane Irma and North Korea's decision to refrain from conducting fresh nuclear bomb tests. Small caps paced the upside, with the S&P SmallCap 600 up 0.7%.XThe Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average all harbored gains of around 0.3%. Volume is running 6% lower vs. the same time Monday on the Nasdaq and higher on the NYSE.Meanwhile, investors shed their defensive stance amid another sell-off in U.S. government debt, a rise in the U.S. dollar vs. the yen, and a dip in gold futures (to less than $1,332 a troy ounce). The Dow utility average dropped more than 1.5%. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond jumped three basis points to 2.17%.The Dow utilities, however, are still up 12.6% since Jan. 1, reflecting growing hunger for income among an aging U.S. population. That's better than a 1.9% gain for the S&P SmallCap 600.However, growth companies are outperforming. IBD's New America Index, as seen in the latest issue of IBD Weekly, is up 24.6% year to date through last Friday.One of the companies featured in The New America is Grubhub (GRUB), which is trading up 0.4% at 56.69, hovering near a three-weeks-tight follow-on entry point of 57.36. The mobile food ordering service has been a Leaderboard member since June 21.Grubhub has climbed 33% since surging past a 42.35 buy point in an elongated version of the double-bottom base on April 27 following smart Q2 results (EPS up 45%, revenue up 39% to $156.1 million). In the second quarter, EPS growth slowed to 13% to 26 cents a share, but investors hailed Grubhub's acquisition strategy to bulk up its nationwide service offerings.The Street sees Grubhub's profit rising 24% to $1.10 a share this year and 25% to $1.37 the next.Alibaba (BABA), featured in the latest edition of The New America, has built a rare ascending-base pattern and is also in IBD Leaderboard. The global e-commerce play added nearly 0.9% to 175.15, just shy of its new 177.10 buy point.Elsewhere in the market, watch to see if Google search engine operator Alphabet (GOOGL) can hoist itself back above the key 50-day moving average. The stock, which slumped below this intermediate-term support line in late July following Q2 results, is down less than 0.3% to 940.84 in dull turnover. Alphabet has been constructing a new base since its failed breakout from a narrow double-bottom base with a 994.09 entry.Alphabet is appealing a record $2.7 billion fine slapped on it by EU regulators who ruled that the company engaged in anti-competitive activities to benefit its own web-shopping services.IBD's TAKE: For now, IBD Stock Checkup for Alphabet is showing a poor Accumulation/Distribution Rating of D- on a scale of A (high accumulation by funds, which is bullish) to E (severe selling, bearish). This proprietary rating covers 13 weeks' worth of price-and-volume action. When a stock breaks out, this rating should be a C+ or higher. Keep an eye on possible improvement of Alphabet's ratings and watch to see if the stock can get closer to its 52-week peak of 1,008.61.Alphabet, which is dabbling in self-driving cars and artificial intelligence, remains an earnings juggernaut. Earnings per share have grown 18%, 42%, 27%, 7%, 28% and 27% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters. Analysts see Q3 profit climbing 15% to $8.32 a share.The Nasdaq 100 is lagging the other indexes, up less than 0.1%.RELATED:How To Invest: Here Is The Easy Way To Spot Major Stock Market TopsInside The Big Picture: 4 Signs The Bull Market Will Stick Around

1425,ADS,"Oil stockpiles in developed countries could hit or fall below their five-year average ""very soon,"" the International Energy Agency said Wednesday, nearing a key target for OPEC, though U.S. inventories jumped on the continued ripple effects of Hurricane Harvey.XThe five-year average is a key benchmark for OPEC, as it considers extending its production deal with non-OPEC members like Russia.In May, the two sides agreed to extend the cuts for nine more months and officials are starting to talk about extending it further. But if inventories drop below the five-year average soon, those output cuts may not be prolonged.IEA also sees crude oil demand growth at the fastest in two years. It forecast crude consumption growth of 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) this year, up from 1.5 million bpd in its prior report, on stronger-than-expected demand in the Europe and the U.S.""Based on recent bets made by investors, expectations are that markets are tightening and that prices will rise, albeit very modestly,"" the IEA said in the monthly report.The agency said global oil supply fell by 720,000 bpd last month vs. July, to 97.7 million bpd, on unrest in Libya and disruptions from Hurricane Harvey in the U.S. The report also said that OPEC output fell by 210,000 barrels, the first decline in five months.U.S. crude futures rose 2.2% to $49.30 per barrel. Brent crude rallied 1.6% to $55.16.Shares of Exxon Mobil (XOM) edged up 0.3% on the stock market today. Chevron (CVX) was up 1.5%, BP (BP) rallied 0.7%, and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) climbed 1%.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The IEA's report follows OPEC's monthly report out Tuesday. OPEC sees higher demand for its oil in 2018 as the global market tightens.Meanwhile, the Energy Information Administration reported U.S. crude inventories jumped by 5.9 million barrels last week, in the second report since Harvey devastated the key oil-refining region of Houston and the surrounding area.Analysts had forecast a gain of 3.2 million barrels, and the American Petroleum Institute reported late Tuesday an increase of 6.2 million barrels.Gasoline stockpiles fell by 8.4 million barrels, EIA said. Domestic crude production rebounded to 9.35 million bpd from 8.78 million bpd in the prior week, but still below the 9.53 million bpd rate before Harvey hit.In it's report Wednesday, the IEA said that it expects Harvey's impact to be short-lived, as more refineries and pipelines come back online.RELATED: Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, CoalThis Oil Giant Is Making A Bold Green Energy Move

1426,ADS,"Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) rocketed Monday after announcing a former Novo Nordisk (NVO) executive will take the helm at Teva, just seven months after its last full-time chief executive resigned amid a bribery scandal.Hours later, Teva said it's selling its Paragard implantable contraceptive to CooperSurgical for $1.1 billion in cash. Paragard brought in $168 million in the trailing 12-month period ended June 30, Teva said in a news release. The deal includes Teva's manufacturing site in Buffalo, N.Y.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Teva catapulted 19.4% to 18.50 to touch a high last seen in early August. Teva led IBD's 17-company Generic Drugs industry group, which rose 1.3% to its highest point since July 26.Kare Schultz will become Teva's president and CEO, Teva said in a press release. Schultz will take over for interim CEO Yitzhak Peterburg. Peterburg assumed control in February after former head Erez Vigodman resigned amid two bribery probes by U.S. regulators.Schultz comes from Danish drugmaker Lundbeck where he worked president and chief executive for two years. Before that, he spent nearly three decades at Novo Nordisk in a slew of roles, including chief operating officer.At Lundbeck, Schultz is credited with leading a restructuring effort and turnaround that put the firm on track of achieving record sales and profit, Teva said. He also previously worked at McKinsey and Anderson Consulting.In addition to the sale of Paragard, Teva said it's actively working to sell its the remaining pieces of its women's health business as well as oncology and pain businesses in Europe. Teva expects to generate at least $2 billion in total proceeds from the sale of these businesses as well as other asset sales to be wrapped by year's end.IBD'S TAKE: Teva has a low IBD Composite Rating of 4 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it lags most stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a closer look at drugmakers with better ratings.Teva shares have been in a slump over the past two years.Teva is the No. 1 generic drugmaker by market cap, but one of its biggest concerns is a branded drug named Copaxone to treat multiple sclerosis. A judge tossed out four key patents on Copaxone earlier this year, meaning generic competition is likely in 2018.In February, Vigodman left Teva in a wake of controversy and, since then, analysts said Teva has lacked direction. In July, it looked possible AstraZeneca (AZN) Chief Executive Pascal Soriot could jump ship to take the top job at Teva, but those rumors quickly died down.Last month, Teva crashed 40% over three days after delivering consensus-lagging sales and profit for the second quarter. Generic drug stocks broadly traded down over the course of 12 days after lackluster reports from Teva and No. 2 generic drugmaker Mylan (MYL).RELATED:Teva And Mylan Under Pressure As Rivalries Loom For Key DrugsBiogen, Teva Slip After Democrats Launch MS Drug Pricing ProbeGeneric Drugs Are Rebounding Despite Teva, Mylan Free-Fall

1432,ADS,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) toppled to a four-month low Monday after its drug Dupixent met its key goals in a Phase 3 asthma trial, but lagged its own earlier results and Amgen's (AMGN) in one patient group.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Regeneron plunged 5.6% to 445.11, to touch a low last seen in mid-May. Shares of partner Sanofi (SNY) fell 1.3% to close at 48.74, and biotechs broadly lost 0.2%.Dupixent is approved to treat eczema, but is being tested as a potential asthma drug because of its ability to treat the underlying causes of both. In a Phase 3 trial, Dupixent reduced severe asthma attacks and improved lung function when added to standard treatment, Regeneron said in a news release.At 52 weeks, 300-milligram doses of Dupixent every other week reduced severe asthma attacks by 46% in the overall population. In patients with medium and high levels of specific white blood cells, Dupixent cut asthma attacks by 60% and 67%, respectively.At 12 weeks, the overall population saw an average 9% improvement in lung function over a placebo.

"
1436,ADS,"Rich Frank was the newly appointed head of television at Paramount Studios when he attended one of his first table reads. That's where the writers, actors, directors and producers sit around a large table — hence the name — and for the first time collectively read the new script out loud.In this case it was for an episode of ""Laverne & Shirley,"" and when it was over, producer/writer/creator Garry Marshall announced: ""The big boss is here."" He turned to Frank, and asked if he had ""any comments.""Frank said he liked the script, but ""on page eight, I think there's a joke that doesn't work.""No one said anything until Marshall broke the ice: ""Then we're going to sit here until Rich gets a better joke.""It was, Frank recalls, ""an awkward moment.""""Then Garry came up to me privately and said, 'You're welcome here. But don't just criticize.'""That was a great lesson.""It was, in fact, a lesson he continued to use at Paramount Television, where he helped shepherd such hit shows as ""Cheers,"" ""Taxi"" and ""Family Ties"" to success and then a decadelong career at Walt Disney (DIS), where he served as president of Walt Disney Studios and oversaw the development of the Disney Channel.He then went on to a second career as a vintner, building what became known as the Frank Family Vineyards from a 200-case-a-year operation to one that currently sells 100,000 cases annually.All of which is not bad for a guy from Brooklyn who really didn't know what he wanted to do when he grew up. He attended the University of Illinois, starting out in the school of architecture and moving to the school of engineering before, in 1965, getting his B.A. in marketing with a minor in journalism.""I finally found something I could do that everybody else wasn't better at,"" Frank said in one of two telephone interviews with IBD.When he graduated in 1965, he went to work at an ad agency in the media department, planning where to place and buy ads. Then he ""switched sides,"" selling ads for a couple of rep firms (who sell ads for media that don't have their own sales force in a particular area). He became sales manager for a Los Angeles television station and ultimately was hired by Chris-Craft Industries to run its television division.The company — better known for its mahogany-hulled boats — owned several TV stations — and placed Frank in charge. The television landscape was much different then — with no cable and only three major networks. The independent stations that existed were mostly limited to repeating shows that had already run on one of the Big Three networks.Frank contacted Michael Eisner, then president of Paramount Studios, to see if he'd be interested in creating original content for Chris-Craft and presumably other independent outlets.Eisner ""called me and invited me to lunch,"" Frank remembered. ""He said, 'I really don't like your idea, but I want you to come here and help us start a fourth network.' ""Frank joined Paramount, and while the launch of the new network did not work out, he was named president of television at the company, where he was responsible for launching numerous successful shows.After a shake-up at Paramount parent Gulf + Western Industries, Frank followed Eisner to Disney, where he was named head of Walt Disney Studios. There his winning streak continued.Asked what he attributes his success to, and one word pops up regularly in his reply: learn.""I think I understood the television business, having first started buying time at (ad agency) BBDO and then selling time at multiple stations around the country. You learn what works in different markets. And then when I went to be a sales manager at an independent station, I learned how that worked — and again at Paramount. I never stopped learning.""His management philosophy is equally simple: ""I'm responsible for overall strategy; (the people I hire) are responsible for how to get it done. I believe in hiring the right people and allowing them to do their job.""I also believe that they should have the right to make mistakes. The people I protect the most are those who've tried something that didn't work, rather than those that just sit there and are complacent.""Certainly complacent is not an adjective ever applied to Frank, who often took sizable risks in his career. He OK'd ""The Golden Girls"" TV series when the conventional wisdom — and the advice of almost everyone around him — said America wasn't interested in a show about four, uh, mature women living in a Florida retirement community.Similarly, he had an idea for a daily syndicated entertainment news program that everyone said was unfeasible. Remember, that was 37 years ago, when computers had less power than an early iPhone and many if not most television stations didn't have the satellite equipment necessary to receive a daily feed.Undeterred, Frank explained, ""We financed stations to install satellites."" One seemed a bit reluctant, ""so we had a kid every day after we shot the show drive the tape to Bakersfield.""The concept of the show was so new and foreign to the TV playing field that Frank had to negotiate new union rules — so that movie industry regulations concerning the number of lighting and sound people that went out on shoots could be modified.That show, of course, was ""Entertainment Tonight,"" which, he said, ""changed the industry and changed the entire world of TV now.""His willingness to push the boundaries of technology doesn't surprise Bob Gazzale, the president and CEO of the American Film Institute. Frank joined the AFI board in 1991 and serves as its vice chair even today, a volunteer position. Frank was also the longest-serving president of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, the organization responsible for the Emmy Awards.Gazzale said that despite Frank's ""extraordinarily busy schedule, if and when I need Rich he's always there.""""Perhaps his greatest contribution,"" Gazzale added, ""aside from the generosity of time, spirit and resources — is his visionary take on the art form that AFI celebrates. ... From movies to television to streaming to gaming to VR ... Rich has always carried the flag for what's next.""Ironically, a portion of his success also can be attributed to Frank's past — that he never strayed far from his Brooklyn Everyman roots.""I think I have the same taste as most Americans,"" he said. ""I think I know what people want to see, who they want to see and what they want to see them in. I'm good at picking talent and have a crazy sense of humor. In a nutshell, I have commercial tastes.""Perhaps the best example of that occurred when he spotted an unknown comedian named Tim Allen at a comedy club doing his grunting male routine. Although Frank concedes that there are ""so many people involved in so many projects,"" it was that sighting that led Disney to produce the show ""Home Improvement,"" starring Allen, which ran eight seasons on ABC.Even shows as successful as that one have shelf lives, and so do jobs. Following the untimely death of Disney corporate president Frank Wells in a 1994 helicopter crash, the vibe at the company changed.So Rich Frank left, content to do some consulting work and spend more time at his weekend vacation property in California's Napa Valley. That home started as a respite from work and included eight acres of grapes, which he allowed a neighbor to harvest in return for a few cases of wine that Frank could share with friends.But Frank got a call from a buddy — winemaker Koerner Rombauer (nephew of ""The Joy of Cooking"" author, Irma Rombauer) — that a nearby vineyard was for sale. Frank and Koerner decided to partner on what was initially known as Frank-Rombauer. (Around 2000, for a number of reasons including estate planning, Rich bought out Rombauer's interest and renamed the winery Frank Family Vineyards.)As Frank recalls, the winery he purchased, Kornell Champagne Cellars, was producing 100,000 cases and losing $3 a bottle. You didn't have to be a genius to realize that was an unsustainable business model. So he and Rombauer, who spent much of his time at his own winery, immediately cut production to 200 barrels a year.Frank understood the old wine industry axiom that the quickest way to make a small fortune in the business is to start with a large one. He quickly — and here's that word again — learned the major ins and outs of the business and realized that he had to use the same principles in the wine business that he used in the entertainment industry that made him sufficiently wealthy to buy a Napa Valley winery in the first place.So he made a point to hire a quality GM and winemaker, Todd Graff, to guide him through the morass. He understood the difficulty of distribution, with 50 states each having its own liquor laws. So he expanded territories very slowly, always keeping the bottom line in mind. And he understood the importance of a good and popular tasting room, the only place he received full value for his wines.Ultimately, though, he understood that more than anything, the bottom line depended on the quality of grapes in the wine.

1437,ADS,"Oil futures fell Monday on increased OPEC production, the first uptick in U.S. oil rigs in seven weeks, and a stronger U.S. dollar, though shares of oil majors Chevron (CVX) and BP (BP) remain near buy points.XU.S. crude tumbled 2.1% to $50.58 a barrel, falling as low as $50.07 intraday  after retaking the key $50 level a few weeks ago. Since oil prices crashed in 2014, West Texas Intermediate has been unable to hold above $50 for more than a few weeks or months. Brent crude futures also continued to retreat after hitting a two-year high last week.Chevron stock was down 0.1% to 117.43 on the stock market today, off session lows of 115.53. Chevron is still working on a saucer base. But as of Monday's close, it has formed a proper handle, creating a new, slightly lower buy point of 118.43 vs. 119.10 previously.BP was down 0.1% to 38.39, consolidating in a flat base with a potential 38.78 entry point. Exxon Mobil (XOM) fell 0.4% to 81.63 and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) was down 2 cents to 60.56, at the top of its buy range after breaking out of a flat base with a 57.85 entry point.Production from the 13 OPEC members participating in an agreement to cut output actually saw an increase of 60,000 barrels per day last month vs. August, according to a Reuters survey Friday. That followed a decrease in August, increases in July, June and May, and a dip in April.Despite a deal made by OPEC and top non-OPEC producers to remove 1.8 million bpd from the global market, OPEC has had trouble sticking to the terms. Compliance earlier topped 90% but is now down to 86%, the Reuters survey found. And OPEC members that are exempt from the deal have also ramped up production.But even members who are supposed to adhere to the agreement, like Iraq, have strayed. Last month, Iraqi production rose by 40,000 bpd due to the autonomous Kurdish region.The latest increase came despite a dip in Libya's production, which fell to a five-month low of  750,000 bpd after an insurgent group halted operations at the Sharara field, according to a Bloomberg report. The country's largest field has been closed this year for everything from protests to power blackouts to security concerns.IBD'S TAKE: Earnings season is about to kick off. Here's a list of stocks near buy points to watch ahead of third-quarter results. U.S. production is also weighing on the market. On Friday, Baker Hughes reported the first rise in U.S. oil rig counts in nearly two months.But a stronger dollar is also impacting the oil market.""Oil is under pressure because of the dollar,"" Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group wrote his daily energy report. ""Talk of a more hawkish replacement for Janet Yellen is one reason. Yet it really is too early to be speculating on that.""Oil is priced in dollars and a stronger dollar makes oil more expensive for those holding other currencies.RELATED: Guess Who Cheated On The OPEC Output Deal?Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, CoalThis Company Has Raised Its Dividend 29 Years In A Row

"
1470,ADS,"Sure, Amazon made a splashy invasion of the retail grocery space when it bought Whole Foods Markets a few months ago, but the e-commerce giant's Chinese counterpart, Alibaba (BABA), has been in that realm for quite some time now.XIt was two years ago that Alibaba decided it could make further inroads into the consumer psyche when it decided to start its own supermarket chain called Hema. Now there are 18 Hemas — not quite the 400-plus Whole Foods outlets that Amazon (AMZN) gained in one fell swoop with its $13.7 billion deal. Still, Alibaba has known for some time there was a reason to break into that sector, analysts say.For one, users with a Hema supermarket app hook up to Alibaba's e-commerce platform and payment system. They can then shop for groceries online and have them delivered or pick them up. Or they can order fresh food and have it prepared by Hema chefs. And they can pay for any of it using the Alibaba online payment platform Alipay. The idea is to draw customers deeper into Alibaba's consumer-facing ecosystem.""Historically, supermarket food delivery has been a difficult, low-profit category from an e-commerce perspective,"" Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy told Investor's Business Daily. ""It doesn't make a ton of profit but the rationale is that it gets people to keep coming back to their online ecosystem, moving Alibaba from a customer acquisition phase to a customer engagement phase.""It's one reason why Alibaba stays vibrant and keeps growing even with revenue topping $23 billion a year and a market cap at more than $430 billion. The grocery business historically operates on the slimmest of margins, but Alibaba aims to make groceries just one part of its many businesses, interconnected via the digital economy, helping to ensure customer loyalty.Along with groceries, Alibaba has expanded into multiple facets of a digital economy, engaged in digital entertainment and movies, financial services and cloud computing, among other businesses.Alibaba also sees itself as a data company, having captured a significant amount of user data with more than half a billion people shopping on its platform that buy something at least once a month. That data has been used for, among other things, targeted advertising and product promotions. It also sells that data to help the sellers of products on Alibaba's e-commerce platforms better target buyers.As if all that wasn't enough, Alibaba also reportedly is working on its first brick-and-mortar mall, a five-story facility near company headquarters, scheduled to open in April, according to a report from China financial media outlet Caixin. The mall will exhibit a number of brands that are on Alibaba's e-commerce platform Taobao, as well as many conventional retail brands. It will also have a Hema grocery store.""We remain intrigued by Alibaba's 'new retail' platform and believe this offers the company another avenue of long-term growth,"" said Hottovy.If you don't know the story already, Alibaba was founded in 1999 in Hangzhou, China, but didn't gain widespread recognition until its blockbuster initial public offering in September 2014. It was the largest IPO ever on U.S. markets, raising $25 billion, with shares priced at 68. Alibaba stock this year is up about 93%. Shares ticked down slightly Friday to 170.25 in midday action.At the end of June, Alibaba said it had 466 million annual active customers and 529 million people visiting Alibaba sites via mobile devices.The company was launched by current Chairman Jack Ma and others, starting with an e-commerce platform for businesses. It then added another website for consumers and then several more. Alibaba emerged as the largest online shopping platform in China and accounts for about 75% of online transactions processed in that country, analysts estimate.""Over the past few quarters, we have constantly delivered superb results, and the market is gradually recognizing the significant value created by the Alibaba economy,"" Alibaba Chief Executive Daniel Zhang said during a conference call after the company reported earnings Aug. 17. ""We are committed more than ever to build a data-driven infrastructure for commerce in the area of the digital economy.""Alibaba's two core e-commerce platforms, which account for a majority of revenue, are Tmall and Taobao. Tmall is China's largest business-to-consumer platform, which retailers worldwide use to establish online stores. Taobao is China's largest consumer-to-consumer shopping site, similar to eBay (EBAY). Alibaba also operates on online wholesale marketplace, called 1688.com, among others.It also operates Cainiao Network, an affiliate that provides a logistics platform that links a network of delivery partners, warehouses and merchants to make package deliveries. Another growth area is its cloud-computing business, which has been growing revenue at a triple-digit rate.IBD'S TAKE: U.S.-listed China-based firms, particularly those catering to China's booming internet population, aren't suffering from lack of growth. Far from it, as names like Alibaba, JD.com, Baidu, Sina, Weibo and others continue to produce blockbuster earnings and sales. Alibaba is an IBD Leaderboard stock with a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99.Strength in e-commerce and contributions from its other business lines helped Alibaba beat the consensus estimate when it reported earnings in August. Revenue rose 56% from the year-ago quarter to $7.4 billion while adjusted earnings rose 60%.Revenue from Alibaba's nascent cloud computing business nearly doubled to $359 million, as paying cloud customers surged 75% to 1.01 million. Its e-commerce operation accounted for 86% of revenue. Digital media and entertainment accounted for 8%, while cloud computing added 5%.China lags behind the U.S. in cloud computing development by a wide margin but has plenty of opportunity to grow that business.""We see huge potential for China's public cloud market to catch up with the U.S., as the growing awareness of public clouds' benefits is driving a growing number of enterprises to adopt this service,"" said a report from DBS Group in July, when it initiated coverage on Alibaba with a buy rating and price target of 170.Several analysts raised their price target on Alibaba following the company's August earnings report, including Baird analyst Colin Sebastian. He raised his price target to 190 from 170.""Alibaba's scale, consumer data, and technological sophistication provides significant competitive advantages that will become even more pronounced going forward,"" Sebastian said in a note to clients.Alibaba's main competitor in the e-commerce field is China-based JD.com (JD), which has partnerships with Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Tencent Holdings (TCEHY). Tencent is China's leader in mobile messaging and gaming, along with China search engine leader Baidu (BIDU).But Alibaba is different from Amazon or JD.com in that it does not warehouse the inventory. Alibaba serves as an intermediary between buyers and sellers. Alibaba gets a cut from the sale of goods on its platforms, known as its monetization rate, which is about 2.5% of gross merchandise sold.""Alibaba is more like a marketplace and JD more like a retailer,"" said Morningstar's Hottovy. ""JD is doing some interesting things but at the end of the day, Alibaba is the most preferred market for online consumers.""Still, Alibaba wants to make further inroads. Currently, e-commerce accounts for about 15% of total retail sales in China. Alibaba sees its new strategy as a way to capture more of the other 85% of retail sales that occur offline and at stores.Earlier this year, Alibaba completed the acquisition of Intime Retail Group for $2.6 billion. Intime operates roughly 49 department stores and shopping malls in China""Our goal is not to simply ride a wave of converting purchases from offline to online,"" said Joe Tsai, Alibaba executive vice chairman, on the company's August earnings call. ""Our new retail strategy is an invention that anticipates and catalyzes changes in consumer behavior where time, place and method of purchase and consumption will be different from what we were used to before.""RELATED:Alibaba Price-Target Increase Comes As China Stocks Stay StrongChina Stocks Battered As Profit-Taking Kicks In After Long Run-UpWhat Amazon's Whole Foods Deal Means For RetailChinese Internet Giant Tencent Earnings Top, Revenue Soars 59%Is Amazon Closer To Fulfilling Dream Of Fast Grocery Delivery?

Bipartisan support is likely necessary for Trump to follow through on his pledges to reinvigorate the economy.XMeanwhile, Q2 U.S. GDP growth was revised slightly up to an annualized rate of 3.1%, up from 3%. August durable goods orders jumped 1.7% on a month-to-month basis, shocking the Street. Ex-transportation equipment, orders still rose a respectable 0.2% while core capital goods orders rose 0.9%.""Healthy readings for these indicators suggest continued upbeat momentum in the industrial sector despite downside risk from the recent hurricanes,"" Lewis Alexander, North American economist at Nomura, wrote in a recent note.The Building-Residential/Commercial industry group ranks 13th out of 197 IBD industry groups for six-month relative price performance. Energy-Solar, Machine-Material Handling/Automation and Aerospace/Defense industry groups are also in the top 20.At 3:30 pm ET, the Nasdaq composite edged 0.1% lower, taking a 0.6% drop in dull trading by Apple (AAPL) shares in stride. Apple had rebounded as much as 3.4% in the past two sessions after hitting a short-term low of 149.16.At 153.10, the iPhone giant remains modestly below the 156.75 buy point in a second-stage flat base, a key chart pattern seen in many top growth stocks.The Nasdaq 100-tracking PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) ETF was off 0.2% and is finding support at its 50-day moving average. But the Dow Jones industrial average edged up less than 0.2% and the S&P 500 less than 2 points, or less than 0.1%.Volume is running lower on both main exchanges vs. the same time on Wednesday.Returning to Apple, the megacap tech is still up more than 29% since clearing a first-stage bottoming base pattern on Jan. 6-9, when it broke out of a three-month cup with handle at 118.12. In a bottoming base, a stock typically declines 50% or more from its all-time high, but then bottoms out and forms a new base that can set up a potential breakout to 52-week highs.Selling a stock once it's risen 20% to 25% past a proper buy point in a cup base, double bottom or other pattern is one of the most important offense-type sell signals for individual investors.Those who have more conviction can decide to hold longer but then must be on the lookout for signs that the tide is turning from that of heavy demand to heavy supply. That's where sell signals, such as a sharp break through the 50-day moving average and failure to rebound quickly, the biggest single-session point loss in heavy turnover, or a failed breakout from a late-stage base, come in.Among top-ranked industry groups, biotech, chip equipment and plastics firms led the upside with gains of 0.8% or more. However, former big winner Gilead Sciences (GILD) fell nearly 5% in fast turnover to 79.82, giving back a lot of the gains made over the past month.The pioneer in HIV treatments cleared a first-stage bottoming base pattern with a 76.59 buy point four weeks ago.Watch to see if the stock can stay above its rising 10-week moving average, which is drawn in red on an IBD weekly chart.The Dow Jones transports rallied 0.4%. At 9880, the index has now risen 9.7% from its Aug. 24 low.Autohome (ATHM) helped spark a sell-off in some names in the Chinese internet space. The online provider of car information and ads at one point slid more than 9% to an intraday low of 57.70 before rebounding. Volume continued to run more than triple usual pace. At one point, the stock got as low as 57.70, below its rising 50-day moving average.When a stock posts its biggest single-day point drop in heavy volume since a proper breakout, it usually means it's a great time to take at least some gains and lighten up on the position.In the case of Autohome, it is also the first time for the stock to pierce its 50-day moving average since an early-May breakout past a 36.11 entry in an eight-week cup. Autohome rose as much as 87% before its current correction. A further drop below the 50-day line, especially in heavy turnover, would warrant selling shares and locking in profits.Autohome fell on news of an abrupt resignation of both President Yan Kang and CFO Julian Wang. The company also named Jun Zou, former chief financial officer at iDreamSky, to replace Wang.The company announced that the resignations ""were not due to any disagreement with the Company regarding its business, finance, accounting and/or any other affairs.""A more serious concern for shareholders may lay in whether Autohome will be able to maintain high growth in its fundamentals.Earnings grew 39% to 71 cents a share in the second quarter, matching the highest increase over the past six quarters. The increase also was an acceleration from a 15% rise in Q1. However, Q2 sales grew 11% to $230.4 million, slowly sharply from gains of 56%, 74% and 16% in the prior three periods.In the year-ago quarter, revenue jumped 49%.Analysts see revenue growth to slow further, to 3% in Q3 to $227 million, then fall 11% to $257.6 million in Q4 vs. a year ago.Despite the slower growth in the top line the past two quarters, Autohome was able to grow earnings by 39% in Q2 to 71 cents a share on the back of improving margins. In Q2, gross margin rose to 81.4% vs. 65.9% in the year-ago quarter.Net margin rose by a surprising 750 basis points to 36.2%, the highest in eight quarters, according to research by William O'Neil + Co.Autohome went public in December 2013.IBD's TAKE: Do you want to quickly check the quality of a new stock prospect in terms of its fundamentals, technical action and level of institutional sponsorship?

1485,ADS,"President Trump has unveiled a tax plan to ignite economic growth and simplify the tax filing ordeal.  Sadly, top Democrats are responding with  divisive rhetoric and lies.  Senator Chuck Schumer dismisses the plan as ""wealth-fare.""  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi calls the plan ""giveaways to big corporations and billionaires.""Intent on stoking envy, these class warfare politicians are willing to forfeit economic growth.  But the nation can't afford to.Here are the facts to rebut their demagoguery:Senator Bernie Sanders smears the Trump plan as ""morally repugnant,"" claiming the rich don't pay their ""fair share.""You'll hear the same complaint in the ""Not One Penny"" TV ads paid for by MoveOn.org and other left-wing groups.  They warn Congress not to allow one cent of tax cuts for high-income people. But the top 10% of earners pay 80% of federal income taxes. Do the math. Any sizable tax cut will have to benefit them. Earners in the bottom half of the nation pay only a sliver — under 3% — of federal income taxes collected.Senator Elizabeth Warren rages that the plan ""delivers massive cuts to corporations"" and ""kicks working families to the curb.""Wrong, Senator.  Business tax cuts don't just benefit businesses. They produce higher wages and more job opportunities for workers.America  taxes corporations at the highest rate of any industrialized country.  That drives companies overseas,  sabotaging our workforce.   The Trump plan lowers the rate from 35% to 20% to make the U.S. competitive.  The plan also allows companies to immediately deduct 100% of plant and equipment costs — a change that will encourage companies to buy more  computers and trucks and hire more office workers and drivers.When countries lower corporate taxes, wages go up, according to  data from 72 countries. American workers have toiled for years without an improvement in take-home pay or standard of living.Democrats label Trump's cuts as  ""trickle-down economics,"" claiming they don't produce growth.  These Dems have forgotten  history.In 1962, President John F. Kennedy slashed investment taxes. After his assassination, his broader tax cuts were enacted, producing eight years of soaring  growth – 5% a year.In the 1980s, President Reagan slashed rates again, giving the nation nearly a decade of robust 3.8% growth.In 2003, George W. Bush's tax cut boosted the economy, producing 4% growth for six straight quarters.Compare this vigorous growth with President Obama's eight years of stagnation.  Obama's economy lumbered along at around 2% because high taxes and over regulation discouraged companies from investing.  Democrats still insist that 2% growth is the new normal. Nonsense.  Roll back regulations and taxes, and the economy will surge.For individual filers, Trump's plan simplifies the maddeningly complex process, lowers rates, and doubles the standard deduction — a big savings. To goose the economy and get money into people's pockets faster, Congress should make these changes retroactive to January 2017. Just because Congress dragged its feet on tax reform doesn't mean the public should have to wait.Pelosi  warns Trump's plan will ""blow a huge whole in the deficit.""  That's a new religion for Democrats.  Don't be fooled.  The real problem isn't that taxes are too low. It's that spending is too high, and Dems want to push it higher.Trump's plan eliminates the deductibility of state and local taxes. That deduction has lulled residents of tax hell  — Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey and California — into complacency. Without it, residents will feel the full pain caused by the tax-and-spend politicians running their states. Representatives from these states are up in arms, demanding that Congress keep the deduction, and they may prevail. But the real issue isn't whether state taxes are deductible — they're just too high.Expect more demagoguery as Democrats try to block Trump's tax relief. They claim to want a  bipartisan plan. Their inflammatory rhetoric proves otherwise.  Unwilling to help govern, they call themselves  the ""Resistance.""  Don't count on them to help rebuild America's economy or grow your paycheck.

The organization also is probing Google's Android operating system, its AdSense online ad service and Google Maps.Monday was the deadline for Google to appeal the fine, which it already has paid, thus lowering its second-quarter profit.RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney maintained his outperform rating on Google but says the internet company could face more penalties.""It has been reported that the EU is looking to take even more aggressive action against Google's Android business practices. Google is in the crosshairs,"" Mahaney said in a note to clients. ""The rub here is that the potential next EU regulatory action may well involve forcing Google to unbundle Android from its other services — search, YouTube, maps, etc. This in turn could provide negotiating leverage to (computer manufacturers) … and thus lead to potentially higher TAC (traffic acquisition cost) expenses.""Google edged up 0.2% to 943.29. on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Alphabet stock needs to rise 6% to reach a 1,008.71 buy point.

1496,ADS,"Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) toppled to a three-month low Thursday after it suspended development of a hemophilia drug, but Celgene (CELG) and AstraZeneca (AZN) both lifted despite a series of decisions by regulators to put several trials on hold.XIn midday trading on the stock market today, Alnylam plummeted by 15.7% to close at 72.53. On the other hand, AstraZeneca popped 5.1% to 31.89 and Celgene rose 1.1% to 141.76. Broadly, biotechs lifted a fraction.Early Thursday, Alnylam said it temporarily suspended testing of a hemophilia drug called fitusiran pending a review after a patient died. The patient was enrolled in a Phase 2 trial with hemophilia type A and died after forming a blood clot.Alnylam aims to resume tests after reviewing the safety of fitusiran and developing a risk mitigation strategy.The firm also said it reached an agreement with regulators regarding the Phase 3 trial design for its drug known as givosiran, a potential treatment for disorders involving the buildup of chemicals that produce porphyria in the body.Pending review of the program at the interim analysis — and assuming positive results — Alnylam said it expects to file an application for givosiran with the Food and Drug Administration near the end of 2018.The FDA placed five trials involving drugs from Celgene and AstraZeneca's immuno-oncology drug, Imfinzi, on partial clinical hold and put one on full clinical hold, citing issues with similar combos using a rival drug from Dow component Merck (MRK).AstraZeneca's Imfinzi and Merck's Keytruda belong to a class of drugs known as checkpoint inhibitors, which work to block a specific interaction in the immune system that would otherwise prevent an immune response. Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Opdivo is in the same class.IBD'S TAKE: Alnylam is still expected to provide data in a rare-disease trial and could be part of a stock rally in September, analysts say. Head to IBD Industry Themes to see why September could be a ""make or break"" month for the sector.Celgene's drugs Revlimid and Pomalyst are known as immuno-modulary agents, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note to clients. In July, three trials combining Merck's Keytruda with Revlimid or Pomalyst in multiple myeloma were placed on clinical holds following patient deaths.The FDA cited issues in combinations of Merck's and Celgene's drugs as its rationale for placing a trial of AstraZeneca's Imfinzi and Celgene's Revlimid on full clinical hold as well. All patients in the trial will discontinue treatment, Celgene said in a news release.""This suggests that the checkpoint and immuno-modulary agent combination is either associated with an increased rate of fatal and nonfatal serious adverse events, or that the combination somehow diminishes the efficacy of immuno-modulary agents given individually, or that the toxicity of the combination so reduced drug exposure as to undermine any potential clinical benefit,"" Porges said.Patients enrolled in trials placed on partial clinical holds can continue treatment if an investigator determines they are receiving a clinical benefit. No new patients will be enrolled in any of the six trials.Trials placed on partial clinical hold include several others in multiple myeloma, chromic lymphocytic leukemia and an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Celgene will continue to enroll patients in trials for acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes.RELATED:Top Biotech Stock Near Buy Zone After FDA Drug ApprovalFour Reasons To Keep Betting On The Biotech Stock RallyHow Bristol-Myers' Cancer Win Helped Boost This Rival

1504,ADS,"Audentes Therapeutics (BOLD) stock made a bold move Wednesday after the Food and Drug Administration granted one of its drugs a so-called ""fast track"" designation, but it gave back much of its gains as the trading day wore on.XAudentes popped as much as 13.4% but by the closing bell on the stock market today, shares were up a mere 1.7% to finish at 29.97. Audentes was among those leading the biotech group, alongside Beigene (BGNE), Regenexbio (RGNX) and Madrigal Pharmaceuticals (MDGL).Audentes' drug, dubbed AT132, is being tested as a potential gene therapy for a rare disease that impacts the skeletal muscles. The condition impairs motor skills and is particularly prevalent in boys. AT132 is currently in Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials. Data are expected in the fourth quarter.On Wednesday, the FDA granted Audentes' drug ""fast track"" and ""rare pediatric disease"" designations. Already, AT132 has ""orphan drug"" designations from the FDA and regulators in Europe, the firm said in a news release. Orphan drugs treat rare diseases.""The incentives provided by the rare pediatric disease and fast-track designations are significant and include opportunities to work with the FDA to expedite the development of AT132,"" Chief Executive Matthew Patterson said in a statement.IBD'S TAKE: Among biotechs, Vertex is getting a lot of attention for its efforts to eradicate cystic fibrosis by using a triple-drug approach. Head to The New America for analysts' take on this effort.A rare pediatric disease designation is granted to drugs intended to treat diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 patients in the U.S., primarily age 18 and younger. The designation incentivizes and potentially speeds up the drug's development, Audentes said.Fast-track drugs receive more frequent communication and meetings with the FDA to facilitate the drug's development program. These drugs may later qualify for priority review.RELATED:Galapagos Pops After Eczema Drug Shows Promise Vs.

1506,ADS,"Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) popped to a 13-month high Thursday after its immuno-oncology combination proved successful vs. chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with advanced kidney cancer.XIn morning trading on the stock market today, Bristol surged 5% to close at 62.84. Drug stocks hit a 13-month high with AstraZeneca (AZN) among the winners, up 5.1% to close at 31.89. AstraZeneca also is working on immuno-oncology combos.Unlike AstraZeneca's lung-cancer failure in July, Bristol's combination met its key goals in a Phase 3 study. The trial evaluated drugs named Opdivo and Yervoy in patients with advanced kidney cancer who had never been treated vs. chemotherapy.Opdivo plus Yervoy demonstrated superior overall survival vs. chemotherapy in patients with intermediate and poor risk, about 75% of patients, Bristol said in a news release. The combo also outperformed chemo in a random pool of all patients, Bristol said.An independent data-monitoring committee recommended the trial be stopped early on its strong results. More detailed results will be presented Sunday during the European Society for Medical Oncology 2017 Congress, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said.IBD'S TAKE: Bristol grabbed a boost to its Relative Strength Rating on Wednesday to 73 from 63, though on Thursday its RS Rating was at 70 out of a best-possible 99. Head to IBD Data Stories for a closer look at what goes into that ranking.The closest rival trial from Roche (RHHBY) is set to finish up in 2020, Raffat said in a note.

1507,ADS,"Small-cap biotech Insmed (INSM) rocketed to an 11-year high Tuesday — leading other risers like Bellerophon Therapeutics (BLPH) and Cellect Biotechnology (APOP) — on strong results of a lung-disease trial.In early trading on the stock market today, Insmed flew 119.6% to close at 26.99, after top-line results from a Phase 3 trial of adults with a rare lung disease met expectations. The condition, known as nontuberculosis mycobacterial  lung disease, is caused by a specific bacterial family.The study found adding a treatment called amikacin liposome inhalation suspension, or ALIS, to other multidrug regimens eliminated evidence of the disease in 29% of patients after six months, compared with just 9% of patients on other multidrug regimens.Fewer patients treated with ALIS died vs. those on other multidrug regimens 2.7% to 4.5%, respectively. This improvement is likely to support ALIS efficiency in the disease, Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz said in a note to clients.Insmed shares popped to a high last seen in January 2006. Other risers included Cellect, which lifted a 10.2% to 10.06, and and Bellerophon, up 4.4% to 1.18. Cellectis (CLLS) stock, on the other hand, was among the divers Tuesday, down 20.3% to 25.66.Cellect's pop followed the Food and Drug Administration granting its ApoGraft orphan drug status. ApoGraft is used to prevent disease which can occur after an organ transplant, as two immune systems crash into one another.ApoGraft aims to solve issues with bone-marrow transplantation and other diseases associated with transplant rejection, Cellect said in a news release.""ApoGraft was designed to eliminate immune responses in any transplantation of foreign cells and tissues,"" the firm said.IBD'S TAKE: Novartis was first to the finish line with a therapy known as CAR-T, in which a patient's immune system cells are extracted and reprogrammed to fight cancer before being reintroduced. But how long will it hold on to its lead? Head to IBD Industry Themes for a breakdown on the sector.Bellerophon rose after it announced positive top line results in a Phase 2 trial for a treatment being investigated to treat high blood pressure in the lungs that's associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a progressive disease that makes it hard to breathe.Cellectis, though, sank after the biotech announced Monday that two of its CAR-T trials had been placed on clinical holds by the FDA after one patient died and another experienced severe side effects. CAR-T treatments are made using a patient's own reprogrammed immune cells.In one trial, a 78-year-old man with a blood cancer known as blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm died following severe side effects including cytokine-release syndrome. Cytokine-release syndrome results in a deadly fever and is often associated with CAR-T drugs.A 58-year-old woman with acute myeloid leukemia, another blood cancer, also experienced cytokine-release syndrome and leaking blood vessels, a condition known as capillary leak syndrome. Both side effects were resolved within 12 days.Cellectis said it's working closely with investigators and the FDA to get both Phase 1 trials back on track. It will also lower the dose of its drug known as UCART123.Broadly, the biotech sector dipped 0.6% on Tuesday.RELATED:Gilead-Kite Deal Boosts Biotech ETF As It Clears Buy PointHow Novartis' Cancer Approval Validates Gilead's $11.9 Billion Kite DealHow Much Can This Biotech Pop After The FDA OKs Its Drug Bid?

""That's really what speculators had been waiting for.""Harvey forced refineries, pipelines, ports and offshore platforms to shut as the storm intensified before making landfall on Aug. 25. While many of those facilities are back in service, others have yet to resume production, including plants owned by Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Total (TOT). Still, Goldman Sachs sees half of the refining capacity lost to Harvey back to work by Sept. 7.

That marks the 13th straight month of growth, but a sequential slowdown from the July's year-over-year gain of 29.2%. Macau's gaming revenue has been recovering after slipping in recent years due to crackdowns on money laundering and corruption. Macau is the only place in China where gambling is legal.Shares of Wynn Resorts closed 3.2% higher at 143.42 on the stock market today, hitting the highest level since March 2015.

We expect a similar 5-cent increase this quarter,"" Flannery said in a note to clients.""This dividend decision will be instructive, especially in light of the recent dividend cuts elsewhere in the sector, and comes ahead of an AT&T (T) decision later in the year.""The Morgan Stanley analyst, though, also notes fierce wireless competition. Verizon bought out Vodafone Group's (VOD) 45% stake in a wireless joint venture for $130 billion in early 2014, adding substantial debt.T-Mobile US (TMUS), controlled by Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY), has been gaining subscriber and revenue market-share for three years — posing dividend issues for both AT&T and Verizon.Verizon had guided to ""GDP type"" revenue growth for 2017 but backed away as wireless revenues were impacted by share loss and revenue pressure, Flannery noted.""While wireless service revenue trends should improve, (fourth-quarter) guidance is still for a decline of less than 4% year-over-year,"" he wrote in the report.IBD'S TAKE: The Telecom Services-Wireless group is ranked No. 1 among the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD, with T-Mobile among the top performers. While T-Mobile has been gaining industry revenue and subscriber share, there's also speculation it could merge with Sprint, easing fierce competition.

1526,ADS,"""Selling isn't something you do to someone; instead, it is something you do for someone and with someone.""That's from Anthony Iannarino, author of ""The Lost Art of Closing: Winning the Ten Commitments That Drive Sales."" He also speaks to sales organizations around the word and is the founder of the popular ""The Sales Blog.""Iannarino adds that ""no part of the sales process can be about you or what you need.""Tips on driving it:Offer the sizzle. The reason it can be so difficult for a salesperson to get an appointment with their prospective client is they aren't trading enough value for that meeting, Iannarino said.""If you can't promise to share some new insight or new idea, then your prospect is going to do something better with their limited time,"" he adds.Expect resistance. Iannarino's ""Commitment for Time"" can be the most difficult commitment to gain. Most companies likely already have a working business relationship with someone or some company selling what you are.Further, the prospect's time is limited and may have been wasted in the past by other salespeople.The way to overcome this, he says, is to promise the prospect you're not asking them to make a decision about changing suppliers and you'll be sharing valuable information with them ""whether we ever work together or not.""Iannarino says to close with: ""If you ever need anything in the future, I want to be the first person you think of. I promise it's 20 minutes. … What works for you in the next couple of weeks? I won't waste your time.""See their perspective. Iannarino suggested asking this question from a potential client's point of view: ""What would concern you when considering what the salesperson is offering?""What would the value proposition need to be for you to agree to spend your limited time meeting with someone you know is going to try to sell you something?"" he wrote. ""What might make you want to jump ship and start buying from another salesperson or company?""Sell yourself first. Great salespeople are passionate about their product or service, says Kate Grasso, vice president of Operations for Cortland Partners, a residential real estate development company.""You can sell only if you yourself are convinced or believe in the value of what you are offering,"" she said. ""It's important to demonstrate your passion, energy and knowledge in every sales presentation.""Prepare to present. Jon Wolken, senior vice president of sales at Kespry, a maker of industrial drones, said that when speaking to customers and prospects, ""I coach my team to focus on how we can help them solve a business problem or improve their situation.""You have to do your homework and learn about the prospect's business with a goal of aligning the appropriate resources and solution to help them be more productive and successful. It's not just trying to sell a product to them but delivering value that's worth paying for.""""It's all about the presentation,"" Grasso said.Target technology. An effective way to sell to consumers ""is when they are out and about, going about their daily activities and when they are more likely to be receptive to the messaging,"" said Barry Frey, CEO of the Digital Place Based Advertising Association, a trade group/business accelerator for digital advertising.For example, health and wellness brands advertise on screens in gyms. Iced coffee ads appear in elevators during summer. Movie ads appear in screens at the mall, when you might be deciding what to do next.""The exciting world of digital out-of-home advertising reaches consumers at the right time, right place, and in their right context,"" Frey said.Follow through. Let you customer know that you want and value their business, Grasso says, adding, ""The more follow-up that is conducted, the higher the likelihood for a sale to occur.""

1539,ADS,"Goldman Sachs started coverage on Momo (MOMO) and YY (YY) with buy ratings Thursday as the two China internet companies cash in on a livestreaming performance that outruns Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR) and others.X""China is leading the world in livestreaming — where individuals broadcast themselves singing, chatting or even eating,"" wrote Goldman Sachs analyst Fan Liu, in a note to clients.Liu set a price target on Momo of 56, a 50% premium from where the stock currently stands, and a price target of 101 on YY, a 39% premium. Momo shares ended the regular trading session up 6.8% to 38.53 on the stock market today. Momo shares have doubled in price this year. YY surged 5.1% to finish at 74.72 and is up nearly 90% since Jan. 1.Momo operates a mobile-based social networking platform with multiple features that includes livestreaming on an entertainment platform that offers variety shows and talent competitions, with revenue this year expected to top $1.3 billion.YY — a member of IBD's Sector Leaders — is a pioneer in livestreaming, offering music and dating shows, live game broadcasting and e-learning, with revenue this year expected to reach $1.32 billion.Liu says livestreaming has surged in China due to a shortage of entertainment options, particularly in the lower-tier cities, and the appeal of its ""freemium"" model, where video is free to view but requires payments to boost engagement.By 2020, revenue from livestreaming will be a $15 billion market in China, Liu wrote.""Livestreaming is the only internet vertical where we cannot find listed counterparts in the U.S.,"" Liu wrote. ""Facebook and Twitter generate insignificant revenues from livestreaming business.""The discrepancy is mainly driven by strong demand for entertainment activities in China and Chinese internet users embracing the ""freemium"" model rather than a subscription model.""Momo is transforming from a unique location-based social network linking strangers (social ""pub"") to an entertainment platform containing a variety of content, including livestreaming, short videos and social games,"" Liu wrote.IBD'S TAKE: U.S.-listed China-based firms, particularly those that cater to China's booming internet population, aren't suffering from lack of growth. Far from it, actually, as names like Alibaba, JD.com, Baidu, Sina, Weibo and others continue to produce blockbuster earnings and sales.Momo reported quarterly results last week that beat on the top and bottom lines, as revenue rose 215% from the year-ago quarter to $312.2 million. Its live video service continued its strong momentum, with revenue of $259.4 million, up 22% from the previous quarter.Revenue from livestreaming helped YY beat estimates for its second quarter.

1540,ADS,"The stock market's ascent has slowed since June. But Wells Fargo Growth Fund's Tom Ognar sees a buying opportunity for the kinds of growth stocks his fund holds, which include PayPal (PYPL), Alibaba (BABA), Nvidia (NVDA) and Netflix (NFLX).X""The market has been a little more defensive, and it seems some higher multiple stocks have corrected a little — but nothing too discouraging,"" said Ognar, who is lead manager of $4.4 billion Growth Fund (SGRAX). ""To us, it opens opportunities. It has made many secular growth stocks more attractively valued.""Those are the kinds of stocks that Ognar and co-managers Bruce Olson and Joseph Eberhardy aim for and that have fueled the fund's long-term outperformance. ""The Growth Fund has always had a bias (in favor of) investing in longer-term secular growth companies that exhibit robust and sustainable growth,"" Ognar said. Many are built for vigorous growth in a variety of economic conditions.That focus has driven the fund in the long term. Ognar has been a manager of this portfolio since May 2002. Going into Thursday, over the past 15 years the fund's 11.53% average annual gain outpaced 93% of its peer group tracked by Morningstar Inc. and the big-cap bogey's 9.01% average yearly gain.This year the fund has tacked on an additional 22.16%, topping 80% of its direct rivals, despite a rocky past three months during which the fund beat only 43% of its peers.Olson has been a co-manager since the start of 2005. Eberhardy has been a manager since late April 2008.The recent downturn is certainly not the only time that the managers have added to names they like. They added to positions in recent quarters in several favorites, including PayPal, Alibaba, Nvidia and Netflix.PayPal benefits from the shift to electronic payments for transactions. That trend is driven by the need to make electronic payments for online transactions. It's also driven by global governments' desire to track transactions so they can assess taxes. The stock is a member of the IBD 50 list of stocks that have strong relative price strength and fundamentals.PayPal isn't the only holding that benefits from that trend. ""Square (SQ), Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), Global Payments (GPN) all benefit from the transition away from cash,"" Ognar said. ""The other big push for that (group) is the movement from offline, brick-and-mortar retailers to online retailers.""In addition, a change in PayPal's business strategy has cut a source of risk. ""PayPal has evolved its business model,"" Ognar said. ""It no longer fights with peers. It has made them more partners. It has signed partnerships with Visa and Mastercard, where it no longer creates barriers (for consumers) using Visa and Mastercard. Now it makes it easier for consumers to make payments through Visa and Mastercard using the PayPal platform.""Alibaba, China's leading online retail marketplace, benefits from the growth of online retail, the same trend that helps Amazon, Ognar notes, and it is diversifying geographically. ""We've felt there was an opportunity there since the (Alibaba) IPO,"" Ognar said.Both stocks are on Leaderboard — IBD's premium service that spotlights play-by-play of top stocks.A third trend that the fund plays is ""the digitization of the economy and consumer,"" Ognar said. He added, ""It's a compelling growth opportunity for semiconductor firms,"" Ognar said. Chipmaker Nvidia, which is another member of the IBD 50, benefits from the shift toward more use of graphics processing units, away from regular CPU computer chips, because of their faster processing speeds in applications such as gaming, driverless and driver-assisted cars, and cryptocurrencies, as well as machine learning and artificial intelligence.EPS grew at a triple-digit pace in four of the past five quarters.IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia is the No. 1 stock in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. It earned that spot in part by posting a 56% jump in sales last quarter and a 27.6% annual pretax margin. You can compare its other technical and fundamental strengths with its rivals' at IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.Portfolio newcomer Netflix is too small of a holding to be the poster child for any broad investment theme for the fund, Ognar says. Still, the stock popped 3.5% on Wednesday. IBD readers saw that the video-streaming service bounced off its 50-day moving average, rising toward a buy point.Among other holdings, Microchip Technology (MCHP) is another chipmaker that benefits from digitization of the economy and consumer. ""Electronics and digitization are influencing more of what we do and the products we use to do those things,"" Ognar said.Microchip Tech's products include signal microcontrollers. ""They're like little full-blown computers within thermostats in your home, the entertainment system of your car, or camera, or brake system of your car,"" he said.While the fund has trimmed its Microchip stake, the stock is still the fund's largest chipmaker. Shares are up 34% so far this year.The fund has trimmed stocks that have been big share-price gainers this year, including software titan Microsoft (MSFT) and video game publisher Activision Blizzard (ATVI), to reduce their weightings. ""It's more of a risk-management move as they've grown in position size, not because of a degradation in growth opportunities,"" Ognar said. RELATED:What's The Stock Market Doing Now?Are You A Newcomer To Stock Investing Who Wants A Few Pointers?

1545,ADS,"Galapagos (GLPG) popped Wednesday after its eczema drug compared favorably with potential blockbuster Dupixent from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) in a Phase 1 trial.XIn morning trading on the stock market today, Galapagos jumped 4.2% to close at 101.21 on its first day in the black in four days. Shares broke out of a cup earlier this month, hitting a buy point at 94.98.Galapagos is partnered with MorphoSys on a drug known as MOR106. In a Phase 1 trial, five out of six patients, or roughly 83%, treated with the highest dose saw their eczema symptoms improve by at least 50% by week four, the firm said in a news release.The results were maintained over two months after the last infusion.

1558,ADS,"Alliance Data Systems Corporation (ADS  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 19, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 25.20%.  Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Card Receivables — accounting for more than 50% of the company’s revenues — are likely to have driven the company’s results. Growing private label card portfolio with a number of wins from both the new and the existing clients will support a solid performance at Card Receivables segment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average credit card receivables is expected to grow 13.1% to $17.7 billion in the quarter to be reported. The consensus mark for operating income is expected to increase 14.3% on 11.7% higher card service revenues.We expect a rise in operating expenses, attributable to the company’s strategic initiatives including expansion efforts as well as higher cost of operations plus an increased general and administrative expense. This in turn might restrict the operating margin growth.AIR MILES issued were lower than expected in 2017 and the company announced to pursue a promotional activity to fuel issuance growth. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AIR MILES issued is likely to dip 1.4% in the first quarter. Also, heightened promotional activity will escalate costs.Netherlands-based brand loyalty business and AIR MILES business in Canada are expected to have boosted results at BrandLoyalty. Backlog at the segment remained strong for the first quarter as rollout of Disney product offering was pushed to 2018.A lower tax incidence owing to the tax reform to drop tax rate has likely improved the bottom line.Additionally, the company anticipates growth in auto, CRM (Customer Relationship Management) and data supporting Epsilon segments. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Epsilon revenues is expected to rise 4.3% year over year to $552 million.The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $4.57 on revenues of $1.95 billion, reflecting a respective increase of year over year.The company boasts a track record of delivering positive surprises in all the last four quarters with an average beat of 8.96%.Alliance Data Systems Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Alliance Data Systems Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Alliance Data Systems Corporation Quote What Our Quantitative Model StatesOur proven model does not conclusively show that Alliance Data is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

1567,ADS,"Alliance Data Systems Corporation (ADS  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 25 before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.36%.  Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.We expect operating expenses to increase in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, primarily due to the company’s strategic initiatives, which include expansion efforts as well as higher cost of operations plus an increased general and administrative expense. This in turn might restrict the operating margin expansion.Moreover, the company anticipates witnessing lower AIR MILES reward miles redeemed, which in turn will weigh on the AIR MILES revenues in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at 1.6 billion, reflecting a year-over-year plunge of 41.5%.Nonetheless, Alliance Data expects better-than-expected performance at BrandLoyalty, one of the loyalty programs of the company’s LoyaltyOne segment. The company projects BrandLoyalty’s revenues and adjusted EBITDA to increase by double digits year over year in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.Further, Card Receivables — accounting for more than 50% of the company’s revenues — will continue to generate higher yields as Alliance Data has been rapidly growing its private label card portfolio with a number of wins from both the new and existing clients. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Card Receivables revenues is pegged at $1.1 billion, improving 12.3%, while EBITDA is estimated at $315 million, up nearly 5.4%. Average receivables are estimated at $17.4 billion, increasing 13.6% year over year.Additionally, the company anticipates experiencing growth in auto, CRM (Customer Relationship Management) and data supporting Epsilon segments. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Epsilon revenues is expected to rise 4.2% year over year to $625 million.Share buybacks must have lent an additional cushion to the company’s bottom line. The consensus mark for earnings of $5.00 per share represents a 7.1% year-over-year gain.With respect to the top line, the consensus estimate is pegged at $2.1 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 17.5%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Alliance Data is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Alliance Data has an Earnings ESP of -1.06%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $4.95, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate’s $5.00. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Alliance Data Systems Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Alliance Data Systems Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Alliance Data Systems Corporation Quote Zacks Rank: Alliance Data holds a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a company needs a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Thus, this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks worth considering from the finance sector with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this time around are as follows:The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on Jan 24. The stock has an Earnings ESP of +0.52% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.American Financial Group, Inc.

1569,ADS,"We are in the first week of the Q1 reporting cycle and only a handful of the S&P 500 players have released their quarterly numbers so far. In fact, this reporting cycle has started on a solid note, courtesy of better-than-expected results from big names in the banking space like JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report).Bullish Q1 ViewsPer the latest Earnings Preview, the bottom line for S&P 500 companies is expected to expand at an impressive rate of 16.6% on a year-over-year basis. Total revenues for the same set of companies are projected to grow 7.5%. The report further predicts that 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors will end the Q1 earnings season with the bottom line improving year over year. Of which, 11 are anticipated to exhibit double-digit earnings growth.Strong Expectations From Business ServicesEarnings prospects in Q1 are encouraging with the Business Services Sector expected to be up 10.7% from the year-earlier level on 4.8% higher revenues.Usually, the sector is directly proportional to the broader economy, which is currently quite favorable. In fact, a rise in GDP, record-low unemployment level, strong job additions, easing of the U.S. dollar and momentum in oil prices are all signs of improvement in the U.S. economy, which in turn should boost the business service sector. Trump’s business-friendly policies, including tax cuts, and repeal of regulations are additional tailwinds.Stocks to Watch for Earnings on Apr 19Exponent (EXPO  -  Free Report) is a science and engineering consulting company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter earnings is pegged at 62 cents, reflecting a massive improvement of 59% compared with the year-ago quarter’s actual figure.Meanwhile, the consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $88 million, reflecting 10% growth from the year-ago quarter’s actual figure.Also, Exponent has an impressive earnings surprise history having surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 12.4%.Shares of the company have rallied 17.3% year to date against the industry’s decline of 0.8%.Alliance Data Systems Corporation (ADS  -  Free Report) is a leading data-driven marketing and loyalty solutions provider. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings and revenues is pegged at $4.27 per share and $1.9 billion, respectively.Earnings estimates, when compared with the year-ago quarter’s actual figures, reflect growth of 9.2%. Revenue estimates shows a 2.3% year-over-year improvement.Alliance Data Systems’ earnings surprise history has been impressive too. The company outpaced estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 9%.The stock has declined 16.5% year to date against its industry’s rally of 6.2%.What Does Our Model Suggest?According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. Conversely, a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell) stock should be avoided, especially if they have a negative Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.While Exponent has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, Alliance Data Systems has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of -1.17%.

(SPGI  -  Free Report) reported solid fourth-quarter 2017 results with adjusted net income of $474 million or $1.85 per share compared with $334 million or $1.28 per share in the year-earlier quarter. Earnings comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.63 per share. The rise on the bottom line came on the back of robust organic revenue growth across all segments.GAAP earnings for the quarter were $263 million or $1.02 per share, compared with $537 million or $2.05 per share in the year-ago quarter. The significant year-over-year decrease in earnings was primarily due to gains culminated in the prior-year quarter from business divestitures. Moreover, tax expenses incurred due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in fourth-quarter 2017 further reduced earnings. GAAP earnings for full-year 2017 were $1,496 million or $5.78 per share compared with $2,106 million or $7.94 per share in 2016.Revenues for the quarter were $1,589 million compared with $1,399 million in the year-ago quarter.

Moreover, non-transaction revenues increased 12% to $388 million driven by growth in fees associated with surveillance, entity ratings and short-term debt. Adjusted operating profit increased 40% year over year to $439 million for adjusted operating margin of 56% (up 810 bps year over year).S&P Global Market and Commodities Intelligence revenues increased 7% year over year to $637 million primarily driven by growth in organic revenues. However, the segment’s adjusted operating profit increased 13% to $233 million while adjusted operating profit margin increased 200 bps to 37% led by strong revenue growth, divestments of lower margin businesses and SNL integration synergies.S&P Dow Jones Indices revenues rose 12% to $191 million in the reported quarter due to a surge in exchange-traded products and increased derivatives trading.

The new dividend will be paid on Mar 30 to shareholders on record as of Mar16, 2018.Prior to this hike, the company had raised its dividend by 12% to 29 cents per share in January 2017.The company also has a share repurchase program in action. It includes a $4 billion share repurchase authorization, which expires on Dec 31, 2020. Supported by a solid balance sheet position, it continues to enhance shareholder value through efficient capital deployment activities.However, the news failed to cheer investors. In fact, shares of Fidelity declined 1.3% in the last trading session, perhaps reflecting investors’ concerns over its weak revenue growth prospects.ConcernsThough the company’srevenues have witnessed a compound annual growth rate of 12.4% over the last five years (ended 2016), it is projected to increase only marginally in 2017 compared with the industry’s 8.9% growth. Revenues from Global Financial Solutions segment are likely to have contributed less due to softness in trading volume on account of lower volatility.Further, Fidelity’s return on equity indicates that it utilizes shareholders’ funds less efficiently than the industry. The company’s ROE of 14.05% compares unfavorably with 24.45% for the industry.Growth DriversThe company’s earnings per share (EPS) have increased 11.15% over the last three to five years. The trend is expected to continue in the near term as well. Fidelity’s projected EPS growth is 15.5% and 10.2% for 2017 and 2018, respectively.Its strong capital position keeps it well poised to undertake opportunistic growth strategies. Its past acquisitions have been accretive to earnings. Further, it continues to drive synergies from the SunGard acquisition completed in 2015.  Moreover, the company’s leverage picture looks encouraging. Its debt/equity ratio of 0.87 compares positively with 0.97 for the broader industry.Additionally, the stock looks undervalued based on its price-to-book and price-to-cash flow ratios, which are below the respective industry averages.Our ViewpointFidelity’s growth prospects look encouraging based on its inorganic growth strategies and lower debt burden. Further, the projected increase in EPS is also encouraging. Also, the company has been able to gain analysts’ confidence, as indicated by a slight upward revision in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings over the last 30 days.However, poor revenue growth prospects continue to remain a drag.Shares of Fidelity have gained 11.3% over the past six months, underperforming the 20.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderThe stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Visa (V  -  Free Report) has increased 5.2% for the current year, in the last 30 days.

Also, the bottom line grew 33% year over year.Mastercard Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Mastercard Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Mastercard Incorporated Quote Better-than-expected results were primarily on higher switched transactions, increase in cross-border volume and gross dollar volume as well as gains from acquisitions.

The figure was also up 20% year over year. This upside was primarily driven by a 17% rise in the number of switched transactions to 16.7 billion along with a 17% increase in cross-border volumes, 13% growth in gross dollar volume and 3% from acquisitions. These were however, partially offset by higher rebates and incentives, mainly due to new and renewed agreements and increased volumes.About 2.4 billion Mastercard and Maestro branded cards were issued as of Dec 31, 2017.Mastercard witnessed 17% year-over-year increase in total adjusted operating expenses to $1.6 billion due to higher cost components like general and administrative expenses plus advertising and marketing costs.Investment income rose 9% while interest expenses increased 36.7% year over year to $41 million.Adjusted operating margin expanded 120 basis points year over year to 51%.Full-Year HighlightsOperating earnings of $4.59 per share for 2017 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.56.

Its acquisitions, investments in technology, a number of deals and partnerships signed with clients across the globe are expected to consistently aid its transaction volume growth, thus driving up the top line.Moreover, increasing use of plastic money replacing cash provides ample room for the company’s growth. Its strong balance sheet and disciplined capital management strategy are the other positives.Zacks RankMastercard carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1576,ADS,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Alliance Data Systems Corporation (ADS  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Alliance Data Systems has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15.35, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 22.19. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Alliance Data Systems’ current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 20.63 over the past five years. Moreover, the current level stands significantly lower than the highs for the stock, suggesting that it could be a solid entry point.Further, the stock’s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Business Services sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 26.10. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers. We should also point out that Alliance Data Systems has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 11.89, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Alliance Data Systems stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Alliance Data Systems has a P/S ratio of about 1.93. This is much lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.52 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, ADS is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Alliance Data Systems currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Alliance Data Systems a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Alliance Data Systems is just 0.88, a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1.77. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 10.01, which is far better than the industry average of 18.81. Clearly, ADS is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Alliance Data Systems might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of A. This gives ADS a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been somewhat discouraging. The current quarter has seen one estimate go lower in the past sixty days compared to no upward revisions, while the full year estimate has seen one upward and downward revision each in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped by 0.2% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0.1%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Alliance Data Systems Corporation Price and Consensus  Alliance Data Systems Corporation Price and Consensus | Alliance Data Systems Corporation QuoteOwing to this somewhat bearish trend, the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which is why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineAlliance Data Systems is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Despite carrying a Zacks Rank #3, the company enjoys a solid Zacks Industry Rank (among top 39% of more than 250 industries), which hints at favorable broader factors. In fact, over the past two years, the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018? Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

1588,ADS,"Alliance Data Systems Corporation (ADS  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 19, before the market opens. Improving performances across all its segments are likely to drive the company’s bottom line.Card Receivables, accounting for more than 50% of the company’s revenues, will continue to generate higher yields as Alliance Data has been rapidly growing its private label card portfolio with a number of wins from both the new and existing clients. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Card Receivables revenues are currently pegged at $1.1 billion, improving 11.8%, while EBITDA is estimated at $440 million, up nearly 33%. Average receivables are estimated at $16.2 billion, increasing 15.7% year over year.The company continues to witness growth in auto, CRM and data supporting Epsilon segments. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Epsilon revenues is expected to increase 6.1% year over year to $576 million.An anticipated 28% lower AIR MILES reward miles redeemed will probably weigh on the AIR MILES revenue in the soon-to-be reported quarter.Share repurchases must have lent additional support to the bottom line.

This is because a stock needs to have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for an earnings beat. But that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Alliance Data has an Earnings ESP of -0.60% that suggests the Most Accurate estimate to have been pegged lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Alliance Data Systems Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Alliance Data Systems Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Alliance Data Systems Corporation QuoteZacks Rank: Alliance Data carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about a possible earnings surprise. Hence, the stock’s chances of beating estimates are left inconclusive.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderA few stocks worth considering from the same space with the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat this quarter are:Visa Inc.

1591,ADS,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Alliance Data Systems Corporation (ADS  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Alliance Data has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13.65, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 19.72. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Alliance Data’s current PE ratio much below its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months. Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 26.93. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Alliance Data has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 12.92, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Alliance Data stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Alliance Data has a P/S ratio of about 1.67. This is much lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.10 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, ADS is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Alliance Data currently has a Value Style Score of ‘A’, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Alliance Data a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Alliance Data is just 0.96, a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1.71. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate.Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 5.41, which is far better than the industry average of 15.96. Clearly, ADS is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Alliance Data might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of ‘B’ and a Momentum score of ‘D’. This gives ADS a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of ‘A’. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been unfavorable. In the past two months, both the current quarter and full year have seen three estimates moving south, compared to no movement in the opposite direction.This has had a substantial impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 8.7% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0.2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Alliance Data Systems Corporation Price and Consensus  Alliance Data Systems Corporation Price and Consensus | Alliance Data Systems Corporation QuoteDespite the bearish analyst sentiments, the stock holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Thus, we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near termBottom LineAlliance Data is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Furthermore, a strong industry rank (among Top 21% of more than 250 industries) instills our confidence on the stock.Furthermore, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1593,ADS,"Riding on higher revenues, Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter fiscal 2017 (ended Jun 30, 2017) earnings of 86 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents. Also, the bottom line improved 25% year over year.  Results were driven by the acquisition of Visa Europe and solid growth in payments volume as well as processed transactions. However, on the downside, the quarter witnessed higher operating expenses.Operational UpdateNet operating revenue of $4.6 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.4 billion. Also, revenues climbed 26% year over year. This upside was primarily driven by the acquisition of Visa Europe and consistent growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions.On a constant dollar basis, payments volume growth for the reported quarter surged 38% year over year to $1.9 trillion. Cross-border volume growth was 147% for the quarter. Cross-border volume growth, on a constant dollar basis when normalized for Europe, was 11% year over year. This growth was partly offset by adverse foreign exchange movement.Total processed transactions for the reported quarter were 28.5billion, reflecting a 44% rise year over year. When normalized for Europe, total processed transactions growth was 13% over the prior year quarter.Service revenues rallied 19% year over year to $1.9 billion on payments volume in the prior quarter. Notably, other revenue components are based on the reported quarter’s activity. Data processing revenues were up 29% on a year-over-year basis to $2.0 billion, while international transaction revenues surged 45% to $1.6 billion. Other revenues remained flat year over year at $209 million.Client incentives of $1.1 billion represented 25% of net operating revenues in the reported quarter.Operating expenses plunged 52% year over year to $1.5 billion. Excluding special items related to the takeover of Visa Europe, operating expenses jumped 31% year over year on Visa Europe acquisition.Foreign exchange rate shift negatively impacted earnings per share growth by approximately 2%.Visa Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Visa Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Visa Inc. QuoteFinancial UpdateCash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment securities were $11.1 billion as of Jun 30, 2017, up from $9.9 billion as of Sep 30, 2016. Total assets were $64 billion as of Jun 30, 2017, almost flat with 2016 fiscal year end level.Dividend and Share Repurchase UpdateVisa repurchased shares worth $2.1 billion during the quarter. The company currently has $5.5 billion of funds available for share repurchase.On Jul 17, 2017, the board of directors approved of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.165 per share. The dividend will be paid on Sep 5, to the shareholders of record as of Aug 18.Fiscal 2017 Guidance TweakedFor fiscal 2017, Visa largely reaffirmed its guidance. Annual operating margin is anticipated at mid-60%, while client incentives are expected to account for 20–20.5% of gross revenue. Additionally, the effective tax rate projection has been reiterated at 30%.Visa reaffirmed annual net revenue growth of 20% with an adverse foreign currency impact of 2%. Adjusted earnings per share growth are projected to be 20% on a normal dollar basis, including 2.5% of negative foreign currency impact.Our TakeVisa’s results reflect robust performance. The company remains well positioned for growth on the back of a solid market position and significant opportunities from its secular shift toward electronic payments. However, high client incentives remain as concerns.American Express Co. (AXP  -  Free Report) and Alliance Data Systems Corp (ADS  -  Free Report) from the same space also came out with flying colors, with bottom lines beating their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate in the reported quarters.Visa carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

1594,ADS,"Alliance Data Systems Corporation (ADS  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 20, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company’s earnings were in line with the expectation. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this earnings season.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsAlliance Data is estimated to have generated improved revenues on the back of a strong performance across each segment. While higher receivables are expected to have favored better results at Card Services segment, higher numbers to contracts supported a decent performance at Epsilon segment.Average receivables increased 16% in the first half of 2017. The company continues to witness growth in auto, CRM and data supporting Epsilon segment.BrandLoyalty performance has likely been driven by growth across the U.S., Europe, Asia as well as expansion efforts in Canada.The bottom line got additional support from share repurchases.However, delinquency rates as on Jun 30, 2017 deteriorated 46 basis points from last year. Expenses are anticipated to have escalated, weighing on margin expansion.The company’s share price has been fluctuating over the last few days and is currently trading at $262.07. We wait to see how the stock performs, post the earnings release.Alliance Data Systems Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Alliance Data Systems Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Alliance Data Systems Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Alliance Data is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Alliance Data has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at $3.47. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Alliance Data carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, an Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies from the finance sector, having the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat this quarter, are as follows.Everest Re Limited (RE  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.26% and a Zacks Rank #2.

1598,ADS,"Shares of Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) are plummeting on Tuesday after the struggling sports apparel company’s second-quarter earnings report sent investors sprinting. The company’s fall from grace happened seemingly overnight, and now investors are stuck wondering: is there any way forward for Under Armour?Under Armour’s second-quarter revenue was up 9% year-over-year to $1.1 billion and the company beat both Zacks earnings and revenue estimates. Yet UA shares fell 8.04% through mid-afternoon trading and hit a new 52-week low of $18.25 per share in intraday trading.What Has Under Armour Investors So Spooked? The company’s revenue figures rose, but investors had become accustomed to years of double-digit quarterly growth. And this quarter marked the third consecutive quarter in which revenue grew less than 20% after a period of massive growth that lasted more than six years.One of the biggest reasons for the downturn this quarter and today’s massive selloff is the fact that the Maryland-based company’s North American sales grew only 0.3% in the second-quarter. The lackluster North American sales growth looks even worse since the region accounts for more than three-quarters of the company’s total revenue.Investors are also nervous about the company’s plans to cut roughly 2% of its global workforce, or 280 jobs, as part of a restructuring plan—half of the layoffs will reportedly take place at the headquarters.Under Armour also lowered its 2017 expectations for revenue growth to 9% to 11% from its previous forecast of 11% to 12%. Under Armour now plans to try to add new wrinkles to its game in the hopes to improve and compete going forward.Star U.S. athletes, who win on the biggest stages in an array of sports—such as Stephen Curry, Jordan Spieth, and Tom Brady—all rock Under Armour gear, but now it looks like the company is headed in a different direction.The sports apparel company expects to try to expand its collections for both women and children. On top of that, Under Armour will try to transition its business into more of a life style brand that can be worn outside of athletic activities—in line with rivals Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and Adidas AG (ADS  -  Free Report).“The landscape is evolving quickly. Therefore we, too, must evolve quickly,” CEO Kevin Plank said during a call.It’s All About The ShoesUnder Armour surpassed Adidas to become the second-largest U.S. sports apparel company, behind only Nike, in 2014. Some analysts believed the company would become the third-largest sportswear brand on the planet by 2030.Two years ago, Under Armour was riding high. Shares had skyrocketed from roughly $13 per share in July 2012 to an all-time high of $51 per share in July 2015.Under Armour had slowly secured a lineup of some of the most recognizable athletes across some of the biggest sports in the U.S. New England Patriots star Brady was the company’s first big signing back in 2010, and by the summer of 2015, Curry, Spieth, Cam Newton, and Bryce Harper were with the brand.Curry, Newton, and Harper were crowned MVP of their respective sports in 2015. Spieth grabbed the green jacket as the Masters champion, and Brady’s New England Patriots won Super Bowl XLIX in dramatic fashion.With stars in the NBA, MLB, PGA, and NFL—where all sports often require their own footwear— shoe sales became vital to Under Armour.In the second-quarter of 2015 net footwear revenues skyrocketed 40% year-over-year to $154 million. This prompted Under Armour’s CEO to predict that shoe sales would make up an estimated 22% of its projected $7.5 billion in sales by 2017.Under Armour’s footwear sales hit the $1 billion mark in 2016. However, today’s second-quarter report saw footwear revenue drop by 2% to $237 million year-over-year. One of the biggest reasons for the decline was the lack of sales and internet mocking of Curry 's “Curry 3” sneakers.Any Positives?Net revenue grew 88.8% in the Asian Pacific market, which helped bolster Under Armour’s total international growth to 56.8%.The Asian markets have become basketball crazed with all of the big NBA stars and footwear companies making massive summer tours throughout China and the rest of Asia. Curry and his Golden State Warriors are the odds on favorite to win another NBA title this season, and his new Curry 4’s, which he debuted in the 2017 NBA finals, have been well received.The two-time NBA MVP’s shoes could prove vital to the company’s success over the next two quarters. But only time will tell if they fly off the selves like the first couple Curry models did.Strong sales of high retail cost items from golf and football cleats to basketball shoes could help Under Armour get back on track. It desperately needs to, or the company might see investors run far away.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.
