8,XLNX,"Chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) is likely to pursue other acquisitions now that President Donald Trump has nixed its proposed purchase of Qualcomm (QCOM), analysts say.X Trump late Monday issued an order blocking Broadcom's hostile takeover bid for San Diego-based Qualcomm on national security grounds. Even though Singapore-based Broadcom is moving its headquarters to the U.S., the federal government is still concerned about the company's ties to China, including firms like Huawei.Another worry is that the U.S. would lose its leadership position in 5G wireless technology if Qualcomm is acquired. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States had cited concerns about Broadcom's penchant for slashing research and development spending following acquisitions.It isn't the first time that Trump has blocked a chip industry deal on national security grounds related to China. Last September, he blocked the sale of Hillsboro, Ore.-based Lattice Semiconductor (LSCC) to Canyon Bridge Capital Partners, which has ties to a fund owned by the Chinese government.Broadcom is likely to remain acquisitive, but will pursue smaller chip firms, Wall Street analysts said Tuesday. Its offer for Qualcomm was valued at $117 billion.Several analysts on Tuesday cited Xilinx (XLNX) as the next possible acquisition target for Broadcom.""Xilinx satisfies most of Broadcom's requirements and is in a stable duopoly, though valuation could be high given Broadcom's historical discipline,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said in a report. Xilinx has a market value of nearly $20 billion.Broadcom's acquisition prospects likely start with Xilinx, ""which appears well-aligned,"" B.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAnother possibility is Mellanox Technologies (MLNX), Ellis and other analysts said Tuesday.If Broadcom decides to step back from acquisitions, it could please investors by increasing its capital returns through dividends and share buybacks, Ellis said.With the takeover threat gone, Qualcomm now has to focus on getting its house in order, BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long said in a report.It faces headwinds in its core wireless chip business and a major legal conflict with customer Apple (AAPL), Long said. Plus, Qualcomm still hasn't closed its purchase of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), which needs to get approval from regulators in China.Qualcomm stock ""could tread water in the $60 range"" until the company can show that it is on the right track, GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives said in a report.Qualcomm shares fell 5% to close at 59.70 on the stock market today. Broadcom stock dipped 0.6% to 261.22.Meanwhile, possible Broadcom acquisition target Xilinx lost 1.2% to 76.14. Mellanox dropped 1.4% to 71.95.A wild card in the chip consolidation trend is Intel (INTC). Last week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Intel is interested in making acquisitions to shore up its competition positioning. The Journal said Intel could even make a play for Broadcom.However, an Intel-Broadcom combination appears unlikely, especially after Trump's executive order, Ellis said.""The president's action not only banned the (Broadcom-Qualcomm) deal, but restricted 'any substantially equivalent merger, acquisition, or takeover,'"" Ellis said. ""That writing could potentially preclude an Intel and Broadcom combination. Even before that, we believe deal size (Intel $244 billion market cap and Broadcom $104 billion), international regulatory approval, and customer supplier concentration fears and thus pushback are sufficient to keep us skeptical.""RELATED:Trump Issues Order Blocking Broadcom Takeover Of Qualcomm

It looks for chipmakers in markets with only two or three competitors and targets those with leading market-share positions. It likes companies with a stable growth outlook, entrenched customers and room for profit-margin accretion.Given those criteria, Broadcom's options are rather limited, Daryanani said.

The industrial giant also raised its full-year adjusted EPS and sales forecast.Lockheed Martin (LMT) topped first-quarter estimates and the defense contractor raised EPS and revenue targets. But the F-35 maker didn't raise its cash-flow expectation. Northrop Grumman (NOC) also reported Q1 earnings above estimates, but Northrop said it didn't submit a bid for the Air Force's GPS III contract, leaving Lockheed as the likely lone bidder. Raytheon (RTN) raised its full-year earnings forecast above consensus as its Q1 earnings and revenue topped estimates. General Dynamics (GD) beat on earnings and met revenue views. Shares of all four defense contractors sold off sharply for the week.The software kingpin earned 95 cents a share, up 36% year over year, on sales of $26.8 billion, up 16%, in its fiscal third quarter. Analysts expected 85 cents and $25.71 billion. Microsoft (MSFT) has been shifting its business from desktop PC software to cloud-computing infrastructure and applications, such as Office 365 and Azure. Microsoft's commercial cloud revenue rose 58% in fiscal Q3. The software giant initially reclaimed a recent buy point on Friday, but pared gains.Intel (INTC) earnings rose 32% as sales grew 9% to $16.1 billion, both well above analyst views.

GM still sees small cars as an opportunity at home and abroad, even as it too shifts focus to larger and more profitable vehicles.Casino operator Las Vegas Sands (LVS) topped first-quarter results estimates, helped by strong demand in global gaming hub Macau and in Singapore. Macau also helped Q1 results for Wynn Resorts (WYNN), but its overall and Macau sales disappointed some analysts. Wynn Resorts also approved a dividend increase.

Homebuilder stocks were generally muted due to rising interest rates. But D.R. Horton (DHI), the biggest U.S. builder, on Thursday bested views with a 52% EPS surge as revenue swelled 17% to $3.795 billion. Homebuilder stocks rallied for solid gains, helped by cooling Treasury yields. New-home sales rose in March to an annualized sales pace of 694,000 units, a four-month high. Meanwhile existing-home prices rose 6.8% in February vs. a year earlier.China search-engine leader Baidu (BIDU) reported a Q1 profit that blew past estimates, lifting shares.

Shares in iQiyi fell after it released earnings in tandem with Baidu.Visa (V) reported a 29% EPS gain on a 13% revenue rise, both beating fiscal Q2 views. The credit- and debit-card giant raised its full-year revenue outlook. Shares leapt 4.8% on Thursday.3M (MMM) met EPS views as revenue rose 8% to $8.278 billion, just above consensus.

At the close, Xilinx was down 5.1% to 60.74 on the stock market today.Upside in the quarter was driven by about $12 million in Bitcoin-related sales of field-programmable gate arrays, ""without which the company might have missed"" estimates, Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland said in a report. Its FPGA chips are being used for cryptocurrency mining in Bitcoin rigs, Rolland said.Xilinx likely booked over $8 million in Bitcoin-related FPGA sales in the first few weeks of 2018 as well, he said. However, Rolland believes the Bitcoin boost for Xilinx will be temporary.""We still contend that crypto-related currency is less durable than their other end-markets ... and that this revenue can disappear fully over two quarters,"" he said. Rolland rates Xilinx stock as neutral, but raised his price target to 70 from 65.IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news on chip stocks, visit IBD's news page Chip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News.San Jose, Calif.-based Xilinx received 47% of its revenue from industrial, aerospace and defense applications in the December quarter, 35% from communications and data center, and 18% from broadcast, consumer and automotive.

Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.45%.Apple shares fell 1.6% to 174.22 in Wednesday's stock market trading, dropping back below a 175.34 flat-base buy point. The stock did find support at its 50-day moving average, as it has since the last days of 2017. But volume was the highest since Nov. 3 and was the heaviest trade in a down session since September.Meanwhile, the relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, fell yet again. (The RS line is the blue line in the charts below.) Already at consolidation lows, Apple's RS line is now approaching longer-term levels. Apple's stock hasn't made much headway vs. the S&P 500 for several months.Apple shares rose a fraction in early Thursday trading.A growing number of Apple analysts are warning of weak iPhone demand. Perhaps the bad news is being priced, or overpriced, into the stock ahead of earnings next week.Lam Research earned $4.34 a share in its fiscal second quarter excluding various items including a tax-related charge, up 94% vs. a year earlier and well above views for $3.69 according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue rose 37% to $2.58 billion, just above analyst forecasts for $2.57 billion.For fiscal Q3 ending in April, Lam Research expects EPS of $4.20-$4.50 and revenue of $2.73 billion to $2.98 billion.

Lam's RS line remains off its highs near the left side of the consolidation.

That was the best gain in four years and easily beat fiscal third-quarter views for 63 cents. Revenue rose 8% to $631.2 million vs. views for $630 million. That's just OK, but is the best top-line growth in five quarters.For the current quarter, Xilinx sees revenue of $635 million to $665 million. That $650 million midpoint is above Wall Street forecasts and would be a 6.7% yearly gain.Xilinx rose 4.8% to 78 in premarket trading, suggesting a move back above a 75.24 buy point. Xilinx fell out of buy range on Wednesday, losing 2.7% to 73.48.The RS line is definitely a concern. It's well below the consolidation's high and hasn't made headway for the past year.

20,XLNX,"Cloud computing firms are driving large investments in artificial intelligence and major chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA) are competing to provide the tech backbone for AI services, a Wall Street research firm said Monday.Nvidia has been an early winner in the field, CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino says. But don't count out other chipmakers, he adds.""While we see different technologies succeeding in an AI world, graphic processors appear to clearly have the most staying power given early success,"" Zino said in a note to clients. ""We also view fears of cloud providers designing their own processors for AI as overblown.""Graphics chip maker Nvidia has captured much of the attention in the artificial intelligence space. It offers an end-to-end computing platform using graphics processing units (GPUs). Plus, its systems are used for deep learning, addressing both training and inferencing, Zino said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""We continue to see Nvidia's Volta architecture in a dominant position for most training applications in the cloud over the next couple of years,"" he said. ""Since the start of 2017, GPUs have sped up training of deep neural networks by as much as 12x.""Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is Nvidia's top rival in graphics processing units. AMD has the ability to sell both GPUs and central processing units (CPUs) to data-center customers. That could give it a ""competitive advantage long-term,"" Zino said.Intel (INTC) leads in the business of providing CPUs for servers in data centers. It's now developing complementary technologies using memory and programmable chips, he said.Xilinx (XLNX), a maker of field-programmable gate arrays, could grow to be a significant player in chips for artificial intelligence, Zino said.""While revenue related to AI remains negligible for the company, we believe Xilinx's programmable chips will see increased opportunities related to machine learning/real-time deep learning in the data center,"" Zino said.He noted that key data-center customers, such as Amazon (AMZN) Web Services and China's Baidu (BIDU), could be looking to broaden their use of Xilinx's FPGAs.Other leading cloud service providers pursuing artificial intelligence include Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google, Facebook (FB), Alibaba (BABA) and Tencent (TCEHY).""We believe that the major public cloud providers will look to outduel each other by offering more extensive AI-powered services,"" Zino said. ""These cloud providers are investing heavily to create an infrastructure that is allowing organizations to use the public cloud for AI as an inexpensive way to test different applications using their data.""Some internet cloud firms are developing application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for artificial intelligence. But those efforts are not likely to threaten the major AI chipmakers, Zino said.""Fears about cloud providers designing their own processors for AI are overblown,"" he said. ""Cloud providers like Alphabet, Alibaba and most recently, Facebook, are all exploring chip development to produce internal chips that can help their AI applications run better while lowering costs.""Those firms are working on ASICs, which are customized to perform a narrow-focus job extremely fast, he said. While an ASIC can be less costly when in production, designing the chip could be highly expensive and time-consuming.RELATED:Artificial Intelligence Becoming Top Corporate Spending PriorityAI News: Artificial Intelligence Trends And Leading Stocks

24,XLNX,"The S&P 500 index and other major averages hit record highs amid a wave of earnings and a weaker dollar, though the greenback rebounded somewhat. Netflix (NFLX) skyrocketed on blowout subscriber growth and a bullish outlook. Celgene (CELG) will buy Juno Therapeutics (JUNO). Intel (INTC) surged on its earnings and outlook, while Texas Instruments (TXN) and some other top chips failed to impress with their quarterly financials, but Apple (AAPL) continued to lag amid a growing chorus of concerns regarding iPhone X sales and production. Airline stocks plunged as United Airlines (UAL) said it would expand rapidly, setting the stage for a renewed price war.X The S&P 500 index, Dow industrials and Nasdaq all rallied solidly to hit fresh record highs as earnings season heated up. The falling dollar, which has acted as a tailwind for U.S. multinationals' stocks and profits, rebounded from three-year lows Thursday as President Trump said he expects a stronger greenback. Netflix (NFLX) was a big earnings winner. Intel (INTC) also did while after Texas Instruments (TXN) and Lam Research (LRCX) were among several leading chip stocks to struggle on earnings. Airline stocks plunged on United Airlines (UAL) while Apple (AAPL) and iPhone-related stocks sold off as several analysts cited evidence of weaker iPhone X demand.Shares rocketed to record highs as Netflix (NFLX) added 8.33 million streaming subscribers worldwide, crushing its fourth-quarter target of 6.3 million. The Internet TV streaming giant ended 2017 with 117.58 million total streaming subscribers, with one analyst predicting 200 million Netflix subscribers in 2020. The gains came despite Netflix implementing price hikes to its service plans in the U.S. and Europe. Netflix credited hit original content such as TV series ""Stranger Things"" and ""The Crown"" and movies like ""Bright"" for its subscriber gains in the period. For the March quarter, Netflix is predicting it will add 6.35 million net new subscribers.Chipmakers Intel (INTC), Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM), STMicroelectronics (STM) and Xilinx (XLNX) beat their December-quarter targets, but got mixed reviews from investors. Texas Instruments (TXN) posted in-line results and its shares were punished. The sector continues to wrestle with concerns that the chip cycle has ebbed. Top chip-gear makers Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) beat views, but sold off on the news. Meanwhile, Xilinx joined Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) in benefiting from the sale of high-performance chips for mining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.RELATED:Intel Beats Fourth-Quarter Targets, Offers Cheery 2018 OutlookBiotech mergers heated up with Celgene (CELG) agreeing to pay $9 billion for the 90% of CAR-T drug developer Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) it didn't already own while Sanofi (SNY) reached a deal with Biogen (BIIB) hemophilia spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV) for $11.6 billion. Celgene's acquisition comes as it prepares to lose exclusivity for cancer drug Revlimid in 2022. Juno rivals Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Novartis (NVS) in making CAR-T drugs to treat blood cancers. Sanofi's deal follows two failed mergers in 2016 and 2017.Early Wednesday, Novartis (NVS) reported core earnings of $1.21 per share on $12.92 billion in sales, up a respective 6% and 2% on a constant-currency basis, and easily beating the consensus. On Thursday, Biogen (BIIB) reported sales grew 15% to $3.31 billion and topped the consensus. Adjusted earnings grew 4% but were short. Also Thursday, Celgene beat lowered analyst views. AbbVie (ABBV), on Friday, topped expectations with adjusted profit up 23% and sales climbing 14% to $7.74 billion in sales.United Airlines (UAL) sent airline stocks into a tailspin after the carrier told analysts that it planned to expand flight coverage through 2020. Investors fear the move, done in part to regain relevance in the smaller cities United once abandoned, risks more competition and cheaper fares, helping passengers but threatening profits. American Airlines (AAL), during its Q4 earnings call, signaled that it wouldn't change its profit and growth targets based on United's ambitions — for now. Southwest Airlines (LUV), JetBlue (JBLU) and Alaska Air (ALK) also reported.General Electric (GE) missed on earnings and disclosed an SEC probe, though core units did well and GE kept its 2018 outlook. Three industrial members of the Dow industrials, Caterpillar (CAT), 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX), reported strong earnings and guidance. Insurer Travelers (TRV) and consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (PG) also beat on earnings views. Verizon (VZ) missed on EPS but topped on revenue. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) topped views, but fell on a patent ruling vs. its blockbuster arthritis fighter Remicade.President Trump slapped tariffs of up to 50% on imported large washing machines and parts, and up to 30% on solar panels. The tax on washing machines decreases and then expires after three years, while the duty on solar cells and modules phases out after four years. Solar technology providers Suniva and SolarWorld charged that China was providing unfair subsidies and financing to its solar producers. Whirlpool (WHR) complained that Korean makers were dumping washing machines in the U.S. at excessively low prices.Whirlpool, which also reported quarterly earnings, rallied 11%. First Solar (FSLR), which initially popped, closed up less than 1%. China-based Daqo New Energy (DQ) lost about 4%.U.S. crude topped $65 a barrel and Brent edged above $71 briefly as oil inventories continued to drop. Oilfield service provider Halliburton (HAL) crushed quarterly forecasts, with international growth outpacing domestic growth. Shares shot up 5%, clearing a buy point. Baker Hughes (BHGE) edged past earnings estimates and was upbeat on spending among its customers. But shares fell nearly 6% as markets priced in the possibility that GE would fully spin off the business.Northrop Grumman (NOC), Raytheon (RTN) and General Dynamics (GD) topped Q4 profit forecasts, though Raytheon and General Dynamics missed on revenue. Northrop gave strong 2018 guidance and lifted its dividend. Raytheon and GD said orders and backlog were strong. All three defense firms surged to record highs. Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Boeing (BA) report next week.Steel Dynamics (STLD) earnings rose 26%, topping views modestly, as sales climbed 22% to $2.34 billion. The No. 1-ranked company in IBD's Steel-Producers industry group said 2018 is shaping up to be a good year, thanks to more moderate inventory levels, improvement in global demand and pricing, and incremental investment driven by tax cuts. Specialty steel producer Allegheny Technologies (ATI) nearly doubled profit estimates. Revenue grew 14% to $910 million, fueled by its high-performance materials for jet engines. Freeport McMoRan (FCX) benefited from higher copper prices, boosting Q4 earnings by 104%, ahead of estimates. Revenue grew 15% to $5.0 billion. Negotiations with Indonesia about ownership of its massive Grasberg mine are progressing but haven't erased uncertainty about the company's outlook.Casino operators Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) both put up Q4 results that beat on the top and bottom line, helped by the rebound in Macau, the world's largest gaming market. Sands CEO Sheldon Adelson cited an acceleration in the mass gaming market in the Chinese administrative region, the only area of the nation where gambling is legal. But Wynn shares plunged Friday, erasing nearly all its weekly gains, on a report of allegations of serious sexual misconduct by CEO Steve Wynn.Ford Motor (F) saw EPS climb 30% to 39 cents as revenue grew 15% to $41.3 billion. Analysts had expected EPS of 42 cents on sales of $37.5 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. Ford is buying mobility startups Autonomic and TransLoc. Shares extended the sell-off from the prior week, when Ford's 2018 outlook disappointed investors. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) delivered strong results and generally affirmed ambitious 2018 financial targets, sending shares to a fresh 52-week high.New Oriental Education (EDU) logged 8% EPS growth, short of views, while a 37% sales gain to $467.2 million narrowly beat fiscal Q2 estimates. Student enrollments grew 43%. The China-based after-school education provider offered guided Q3 sales views higher, but shares tumbled, though they recouped some losses by the end of the week. TAL Education (TAL), meanwhile, surged nearly 18% on Thursday, retaking their 50-day, after Q3 EPS jumped 168% on 66% revenue growth to $433 million. TAL enrollments swelled 85%.TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and E-Trade Financial (ETFC) beat on both their top and bottom lines. Fiscal Q1 earnings per share jumped 95% at TD Ameritrade as revenue expanded 46% to $1.26 billion. It sees full-year earnings of  $2.55-$3.05 excluding items, vs. expectations for $2.69. TD Ameritrade also said it will allow customers to buy and sell certain ETFs 24/7, five days a week. E-Trade reported Q4 EPS up 49% and revenue up 25% to $637 million. It'll also acquire one million retail brokerage accounts from Capital One Financial (COF) with about $18 billion in assets. Shares of both online brokers fell modestly for the week.Millennial-focused free investing app Robinhood will let people buy and sell Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with zero commission.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) reported adjusted income of $2.54 per share on $892 million in sales, rising a respective 25% and 18%. Both metrics topped expectations. But the robot-surgery gear maker gave cautious guidance.Homebuilder NVR (NVR) missed Q4 earnings and sales views. Shares tumbled 11%, crashing through its 10-week line for the first time in more than a year in huge volume. Along with DOJ subpoena of the mortgage unit of Lennar (LEN) and a bigger-than-expected new-home sales decline, other homebuilders also suffered notable declines.

25,XLNX,"A good economy had the odd effect of sinking the S&P 500 on Monday, amid concerns about higher prices and borrowing costs as central banks remove the crutches intended to support rebounds in the U.S. and abroad.X But for the individual companies in the S&P 500 index, quarterly results — that more granular measure of customer attitudes and one of the main drivers of any stock — are surpassing Wall Street forecasts at a particularly high rate, one not seen since the previous decade.The above-the-bar results have been helped, as ever, by tech, health care and financials, including Amazon (AMZN), Intel (INTC) UnitedHealth (UNH) and Mastercard (MA). But companies like DowDuPont (DWDP) and Eastman Chemical (EMN) have led suppliers of materials higher. Industrials — minus long-ailing General Electric (GE) — also look solid after a long drought.Among the 322 S&P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results so far this earnings season, 78% topped Wall Street estimates, according to Thomson Reuters data released Thursday. Eighty percent beat estimates for revenue.That's the best rate of above-estimate earnings since the third quarter of 2009, according to Thompson Reuters. For sales, it's the best since at least 2002.S&P 500 earnings are currently on track to deliver a 14.7% gain, with revenue up a robust 8%. That assumes that the remaining S&P 500 companies due to report will meet estimates.Analysts also appear optimistic about first-quarter earnings, even as the prospect of higher wages touches off investor fears of inflation, and economic growth stirs anxieties that the Federal Reserve will be more aggressive in raising interest rates to keep that growth honest.IBD'S TAKE: After the Thursday, Feb. 1, market action — and before Friday's and Monday's market drubbings — IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" from ""confirmed uptrend,"" the equivalent of a green light turning yellow. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's prevailing trend, so you'll know when it makes sense to be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Still, the global recovery has brought new demand for technology, energy and infrastructure. And a rebound in oil prices has boosted demand for equipment of all kinds, lifting industrials and, in turn, demand for the suppliers of chemical materials.In the stock market today, the S&P 500 index, Dow industrials and Nasdaq composite sold off yet again as Treasury yields hit multiyear highs. Stocks rallied strongly to start 2018 in part on expectations for strong, broad earnings growth.Within Thomson Reuters' Materials sector, which includes companies like DowDuPont and Eastman, 94% of companies have beat on earnings for the most recent quarter — the highest percentage of all 11 industry sectors measured by the firm. Eighty-one percent of companies in the Materials segment have beat on revenue.Even as the troubles deepen at General Electric, which has weighed on growth in the industrial sector as it tries to focus more on aviation, power and health care — that segment overall has remained solid. Seventy-four percent have beat on earnings, 81% on revenue.GE earnings per share slid 41% in the fourth quarter. It faces an SEC investigation, and one analyst said the company could be removed from the Dow.Within the technology sector, 85% of technology companies have beaten earnings estimates, led by companies like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), CA (CA), Intel (INTC) and Xilinx (XLNX). Ninety percent beat on revenue, amid strong growth in semiconductors and semiconductor equipment.More tech companies are also bringing in bigger businesses as consumers.""You're seeing a transition from consumer-based to business-based, which is a big driver,"" Aurelio said. ""So you're seeing things like data-center growth.""In the Consumer-Discretionary category, where around three quarters of companies have produced above-the-bar results, Amazon (AMZN) last week turned out earnings far ahead of analyst expectations, helped by the GOP's new tax law and the broader migration to e-commerce and smart devices.""Our 2017 projections for Alexa were very optimistic, and we far exceeded them,"" CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement at that time. ""We don't see positive surprises of this magnitude very often — expect us to double down.""Earnings from 89% of companies in Thomson Reuters' Health Care segment — which includes biotech, pharmaceuticals and health care services — came in above analyst views; 91% beat on revenue.UnitedHealth, the nation's largest health insurer, was among them. But the companies that surpassed earnings estimates by the widest margin were pharma distributor Cardinal Health (CAH), ResMed (RMD) and Align Technology (ALGN), the maker of Invisalign dental braces.Those earnings follow a 2017 that BMO analyst Matt Borsch (who follows managed care companies, hospitals and other care providers) characterized as mediocre, in terms of volume — or the number of inpatient admissions, outpatient procedures, and doctor and emergency-room visits.But more of that volume, he said, has been packed into the end of the fourth quarter, as more people meet their deductible on their high-deductible plans, which have become increasingly common.""When you have the high-deductible health plans, you generally have a pretty strong dynamic of people, on average, increasing their utilization significantly after they've met the deductible, and therefore that is why you see that more late in the year,"" he said.The companies who have reported so far, largely, aren't benefiting from low expectations, either. Expectations have remained relatively similar for earnings this quarter compared with quarters past and were a tad higher for revenue, Aurelio said.As investors make their way through fourth-quarter results and the market's volatility, the outlook for the first quarter remains not so bad.""Typically as you get closer to the next earnings season, the expectations decrease,"" Aurelio said. ""So we'd see the growth rate for Q1 normally drop, and it's been going up.""At the beginning of the year, he said, expectations were for 12.2% earnings growth in the first quarter. On Thursday, growth expectations were for 17.8%. That's despite lowered guidance from Apple (AAPL) and many iPhone chip suppliers.""So that's a pretty bullish signal,"" he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Will Stocks Repeat The 2011 Bear Sell-Off?Big Wage Gain Sinks Stocks, Bonds: 3 Reasons To Doubt The DataDid Congress, Trump Just Crush The Stock Market Rebound?Will Brokerages Receive Fresh Lift From Tax Reform, Rate Hikes?ObamaCare Exchange Enrollment Shows Surprise Gain, Despite Trump's Attacks

26,XLNX,"A steepening stock market sell-off made for a tough first day of work for Jerome Powell, officially sworn in as the chairman of the Federal Reserve on Monday, as markets sliced lower in a continuation of Friday's heavy distribution.X The Dow Jones industrial average faltered 4.6%, down almost 1,200 points for its largest-ever point loss, with all but three of its stocks posting losses greater than 2%.The S&P 500 unraveled 4.1%, with Wells Fargo (WFC) posting the index's worst decline,  down almost 10%,  as investors reacted to penalties imposed by the Federal Reserve on Friday. The sanctions, imposed on Janet Yellen's final day as head of the Fed, stirred concerns that regulators, under Powell, could be set for a more authoritarian turn.The Nasdaq composite dropped 3.8%, with Apple (AAPL) carving 2.5% lower and, among the FANG tech leaders, Alphabet (GOOGL) and Netflix (NFLX) down about 5%.A couple of brief intraday market rebound attempts quickly collapsed, although bonds took back some ground, driving the 10-year yield to 2.79% from 2.84% as both the dollar and commodities traded mixed.Big Oil names were again key contributors to the day's declines, as U.S. benchmark crude dropped more than 2%, to just below $64 a barrel.  Exxon-Mobil (XOM) and  Chevron (CVX) led the downside on the Dow, each skidding more than 5%. Total (TOT) and BP (BP) fell sharply.Among other Dow components, Boeing (BA) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) dived 6% and 5%. United Technologies' (UTX) decline reached 5.5% as the stock fell below the 50-day line.Shipping was the session's strongest industry, buoyed by a 3% gap up from Kirby (KEX). The inland and coastal waterways operation announced it would buy barge transportation outfit Higman Marine for $419 million. Kirby shares are extended after a breakout from a cup-with-handle base in January.China-based stocks took some bruises, led by Sina's (SINA) 4% fall. The firm-volume decline droves shares to a test of their 10-week moving average. Sina is less than 4% below a 113.05 buy point in a double-bottom base — avoiding an automatic sell rule.Chips traded broadly lower, despite the ostensibly positive news that Broadcom (AVGO) had ratcheted up its bid to acquire Qualcomm (QCOM) to more than $121 billion. Broadcom lost 3% and Qualcomm skittered nearly 6% lower.Among other chip leaders, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) gave up 7%, Qorvo (QRVO) declined 6%, Xilinx (XLNX) took a 5% loss.Graphics chip leader Nvidia (NVDA) unspooled an 8.5% decline. Shares ended just at the 50-day moving average, and just below a 218.77 buy point in a cup with handle base.RELATED:Dow Suffers Worst Point Drop Ever, But Percentage Loss Not HistoricStocks Continue Wild Action Late; These 3 Chipmakers Move On EarningsFed's Wells Fargo Punishment Sets Precedent For Harsher Era Broadcom Raises Bid For Qualcomm, Calls It 'Best and Final Offer'It's Time To Review Your Stock-Selling SmartsHow Do You Spot A Major Stock Market Top?

27,XLNX,"Investors should follow the action of the major averages and leading stocks. So what did they tell us on Thursday? 1. The dollar is a big market driver, especially for multinationals. 2. Apple (AAPL) and a slew of iPhone-related stocks continue to lag and break key technical levels. 3. Overnight trading is not always confirmed in the next day's regular-session trades.X S&P 500 index futures rose 0.3% vs. fair value in early Friday morning trading. Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.45%.Stocks opened higher in Thursday's market trading in part on overnight comments by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that ""a weaker dollar is good"" for U.S. trade, sending the greenback to a fresh three-year low. But President Trump told CNBC on Thursday afternoon that Mnuchin's comments were taken out of context and he sees the dollar strengthening. That sent the dollar higher, closing little changed. The major averages pulled back on Trump, then steadied at the close along with the currency.A weaker greenback makes U.S. exports more competitive and flatters companies' overseas profits in dollar terms. So shares of U.S. companies with big exposure to foreign markets tend to do better with a falling dollar.Apple's relative weakness has been a steady theme in the evening Stock Market Today column. A day after falling below a recent flat-base buy point in heavy volume, Apple slid 1.8% to 171.11 on mounting concerns over iPhone X demand. The stock closed modestly below its 50-day moving average. Meanwhile, the relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, slumped to its worst level since July. (The RS line is the blue line in the chart below.)That underperformance is magnified by the action of iPhone-related stocks.Broadcom (AVGO) fell below its 200-day moving average for the first time in nearly two years, joining fellow iPhone chipmakers Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO). All three stocks' RS lines are at 52-week lows.Universal Display (OLED), which makes technology used in making OLED screens for high-end phones like the iPhone X and other devices, tumbled 5.7% to 168.25. That's part of a 19% five-day sell-off, plunging Universal Display below a buy point and its 50-day moving average. That follows another failed OLED-related breakout: laser maker Coherent (COHR).There's an old Russian proverb that morning is wiser than the evening. That's certainly something to keep in mind with after-hours action. In the midst of earnings season you'll see dozens of stocks soaring or tumbling after the market close or before the opening bell. Sometimes that carries over to the next regular trading session, but sometimes the action is radically different.There are many reasons why. Extended trading, even when relatively heavy, is thin compared with activity in regular exchange hours. Investors may miss key details initially that are picked up on later. Companies sometimes hold conference calls the next morning or after the opening bell.In late trading Wednesday, Lam Research (LRCX) and Xilinx (XLNX) rallied on earnings and looked set to at least test buy points. But after opening higher, the chip stocks reversed sharply lower, both closing down about 5%.Keep that in mind for Friday's regular session. Industry giant Intel (INTC) rallied in extended trading on its earnings report and sales guidance. That's a hopeful sign for how Intel will trade in normal hours, but no guarantee.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Blue Chips Advance, But Breakouts Sparse After Facebook And Google Breakouts, This Internet Stock May Be Next 3 China Names In Buy Range; Can You Find The Strengths, Flaws?Where To Look For Dominance In The Stock MarketHighflying New Issue Looks To Add To Its Big 2017 Post-IPO GainsIntel Rises Late On Strong Earnings, Guidance

28,XLNX,"Thursday's session was volatile early after major stock indexes opened nicely higher amid more weakness in the U.S. dollar and a three-year high for the euro. But the dollar moved off lows and the euro weakened after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi hinted that 2018 could come and go with no rate hikes despite improving economic conditions in the eurozone.X In late-afternoon trading, the Dow Jones industrial average led the way, rising 0.3%. Dow Jones industrial component 3M (MMM) was a top gainer in the blue-chip index, up around 2%, after the company reported accelerating earnings and sales growth and also increased its dividend to $1.36 a share. That gives it an annualized yield of around 2.1%. Boeing (BA) also delivered a solid gain, up around 2%.The Nasdaq composite eased less than 0.2% as semiconductor stocks lagged. The S&P 500 gave back 0.1%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking lower than Wednesday's levels in the stock market today.Some of the worst performers in the Nasdaq 100 hailed from the chip sector with names like Broadcom (AVGO), Lam Research (LRCX), Xilinx (XLNX) showing losses ranging from 3% to 4%.Netflix (NFLX) and Biogen (BIIB) outperformed in the Nasdaq 100 with gains of around 2% to 3%.Airlines were also hard hit amid earnings from American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest (LUV). Shares of American slumped nearly 3% after gapping down 6% Wednesday.  Southwest dropped nearly 4%, giving up support at the 50-day moving average after posting modest fourth-quarter growth.Varian Medical Systems (VAR) was a standout performer on strong earnings, soaring 11% to 125.03. The stock gapped out of a flat base with a 114.19 entry, meaning the open price at 123 was a legitimate entry.After Wednesday's distribution day for the Nasdaq, some leading growth stocks are starting to show chinks in their armor.Elsewhere, buyers of Universal Display (OLED) at the last breakout over 145.40 have reason to take at least partial profits after three straight declines in heavy volume, and another one taking shape Thursday. Universal Display breached the 50-day moving average Wednesday. Shares were down another 6% to 168.43.Coherent (COHR) has also stumbled in recent days as it trades below the 50-day moving average. Shares in the former member of the IBD 50 reversed lower Thursday, dropping 3% to 274.77.After falling 1.6% in heavy volume Wednesday, Apple (AAPL) extended losses and gave up support at the 50-day moving average, falling 1.5%. It's also given up a 176.34 buy point. Earnings are due Feb. 1 after the close.Also inside the IBD 50, RV makers Winnebago Industries (WGO) and Thor Industries (THO) lagged with losses of around 5% to 6%.RELATED:Homebuilder Stocks Fall On Lennar Mortgage Probe, NVR Earnings, New-Home SalesAmazon Price Target Raised On Expectations Of Strong ResultsBest Stocks To Buy And Watch

That was down from a 3.2% gain in the third quarter and below economist consensus views for a 2.9% advance. Consumer spending surged 3.8%, a big jump above the third quarter's 2.2% estimate, and beating forecasts for a 3.6% gain.December durable goods orders were better than expected, up 2.9%, nearly doubling November's 1.7% increase and clobbering expectations for a 0.6% rise. Transportation was the primary factor in the beat — minus transport goods, orders rose 0.6% for the month, well above November's 0.3% rise and in line with expectations.Intel powered ahead almost 7% — leading the Dow and the Nasdaq 100 — on the heels of its fourth-quarter report, a clean beat that included a dividend increase and an upgraded outlook. The stock has been struggling since news of security lapses affected nearly all of its products made over the past five years. That news killed a breakout attempt and sent the stock lower in early January. The stock has been fighting to hold support at its 10-week moving average.Leading chip developer Maxim Integrated jumped almost 2% after a late-Thursday report showing in line earnings and revenue for its fiscal second quarter, but third quarter guidance that topped consensus views. The stock had pulled back to just below a 55.53 buy point in a flat base.Other chipmakers saw some buying spillover, with Xilinx (XLNX) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) both rising more than 2%.Apple (AAPL) opened 0.2% lower, while Amazon.com (AMZN) led the FANG stock tech leaders with a 0.6% gain.Many China names moved higher after the Hong Kong market ended a strong week. Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA) and Weibo (WB) traded up 2% each. Both stocks had ended Thursday in buy zones.Online retail giant JD.com vaulted 4%, breaking out above a 47.50 buy point. Bloomberg reported JD.com planned to enter the U.S. market in 2018, and was seeking to finance the expansion, in part, through a deal in which shareholder Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) would buy 15% of its logistics unit. Tencent rose 2.2% in opening trade, after posting a strong advance in China's markets Friday.Drugmaker Abbvie (ABBV) punched up nearly 6% after clearing analysts' revenue and earnings targets by wide margins in its fourth-quarter results. Shares are extended 15% above a flat base buy point of 98.36.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) dropped 4% in early action, despite fourth-quarter revenue and earnings well above analyst forecasts. But the late Thursday report also showed a $318 million charge related to reformed U.S. tax rules. Intuitive ended Thursday 11% above a 405.15 buy point in a flat base.Starbucks (SBUX) dived 5%. The coffee-house chain's late Thursday report beat on earnings, missed on revenue and guided 2018 earnings above consensus views. Founder and Chief Executive Howard Schultz chatted up the future of cryptocurrencies during the conference call with investors. The heavy-volume loss drove shares back below a 59.93 buy point in a seven-month saucer-with-handle base.E-Trade Financial (ETFC) slumped 2.3%, after topping fourth-quarter earnings and sales estimates, and announcing plans to acquire one million retail brokerage accounts from Capital One Financial (COF) for $170 million. E-Trade shares have been trading tight, near highs and up 18% from a December breakout.Asia's stock markets were sharply mixed Friday, with Tokyo's Nikkei 225 slipping 0.2% as the dollar continued its dive vs. the yen.  In China, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index powered up 1.5% — apparently helped by a Morgan Stanley report that boosted price targets on China's banks, due to higher net interest margins and improved asset quality, according to the South China Morning Post.The Nikkei 225 ended the week down 0.7%. The Hang Seng finished up 2.8% in a seventh straight weekly gain.European markets extended early gains in afternoon trade, with the CAC-40 in Paris up 1.1% and London's FTSE 100 ahead 0.5%, while Frankfurt's DAX showed a 0.3% gain.OTHER IMPORTANT MARKET NEWS FOR FRIDAY:The Big Picture: Blue Chips Advance, But Breakouts Sparse3 Lessons From Today's Volatile Action3 China Names In Buy Range: Can You Find The Strengths, Flaws?Intel Beats Fourth-Quarter Targets, Offers Cheery 2018 Outlook

32,XLNX,"Graphics-chip maker Nvidia (NVDA) is poised for another winning year in 2018, a Wall Street investment bank predicted Monday.X Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse said his best ideas in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries in 2018 are unchanged from 2017. They include Nvidia, Micron Technology (MU), Analog Devices (ADI), Xilinx (XLNX), Western Digital (WDC), Applied Materials (AMAT), ASML Holding (ASML), Lam Research (LRCX) and Universal Display (OLED).""Yes, semiconductor stocks had an excellent run in 2017 – with the SOX up 39%,"" Muse said in a note to clients. ""But multiples still remain below the broader market and remain inexpensive vs. most other cyclicals. And very importantly, we believe we are on the cusp of true rising silicon intensity led by AI/Big Data (creation, transmission, analytics, storage) that will likely drive the third meaningful upcycle for semis.""Still, chip stocks will ""face a wall of worry"" in 2018 as fears persist that the current cycle is peaking, he said.Nvidia is likely to lead semi stocks for the third year in a row, thanks to its leadership in artificial intelligence, Muse said.He has a near-term price target on Nvidia of 250, but longer term sees it hitting 300.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks includes Nvidia, Applied Materials and Universal Display.Nvidia jumped 3% to close at 199.35 on the stock market today.In addition to artificial intelligence and Big Data, another technology trend in 2018 will be the continued adoption of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays in smartphones, Muse said.The OLED trend is helping equipment maker Applied Materials and technology and materials supplier Universal Display, he said.RELATED:Entegris Looking For China Growth, Possible Acquisitions In 2018Wall Street Analysts Identify Top Chip Takeover Targets For 2018Looking For The Next Nvidia?

33,XLNX,"Telecom companies dashed the hopes of investors betting on a frenzy of mergers and acquisitions last year, but Broadcom's (AVGO) pursuit of Qualcomm (QCOM) and Walt Disney's (DIS) deal with 21st Century Fox (FOXA) have primed the pump for 2018 M&A in semiconductors and media.Wall Street analysts say 2018 is shaping up a bigger year for mergers and acquisitions, amid slower activity since the 2015 boom.One reason is the expected cut in corporate taxes, including lower levies on overseas cash brought into the U.S. For private equity firms and others that structure deals using high-yield debt the good news is that deductions on interest expenses are still allowed, though capped.Some companies may target deals that optimize corporate structure around new tax policies, says investment bank Goldman Sachs. Others may take the common M&A routes of gaining scale and cutting costs or expanding into new markets.""All the right ingredients are in place,"" said Marc Suidan, a partner and tech sector leader in PricewaterhouseCooper's M&A advisory practice. ""Tax clarity could bring some money onshore, facilitating some transactions. A lot of big tech companies have ample cash in any event. And, strategically companies are making big bets on emerging technologies.""PwC says tech companies will aim to acquire startups in artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and the Internet of Things, a system of web-connected devices.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Startups' easy access to venture capital funding, though, has made it hard for tech giants to gobble up hot private companies.Another reason for slower M&A in 2017 was public company valuations. Targeted companies were leery of all-stock acquisition proposals, analysts say, fearing a possible market correction.Goldman Sachs analysts are among those expecting a rebound in 2018 after M&A activity dipped in late 2016 and 2017. Republicans pushed through lower corporate tax rates, which may free up cash for deal making.""Reduced policy uncertainty should increase the fundamental incentive for corporate acquisitions,"" a Goldman Sachs report said.Companies that could be involved in M&A in 2018 include Twitter (TWTR), Twillio (TWLO), Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD), Hortonworks (HDP), Lumentum Holdings (LITE) and Acacia Communications (ACIA), the investment bank said.Of course, even if a sector looks ripe for consolidation, merger talks can fizzle out. Telecom investors bid up shares of T-Mobile US (TMUS), Sprint (S), Dish Network (DISH) and Charter Communications (CHTR) on takeover speculation in 2017 only to be disappointed.T-Mobile and Sprint shelved their merger talks in November. And cable TV firm Charter remains independent despite rumored suitors such as Verizon Communications (VZ), Japan's SoftBank, Altice US (ATUS) and Comcast (CMCSA).Here's a snapshot of sectors and companies to watch in 2018:Media. In the wake of Disney gobbling up much of 21st Century Fox, more media deals are expected. Discovery Communications (DISCA) and Scripps are already betrothed. Some analysts speculate that CBS (CBS) will be next to find a mate. RBC Capital sees a potential match in CBS and Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF).The Trump administration has sued to block AT&T's (T) purchase of Time Warner (TWX), creating uncertainty over antitrust policy. A federal judge may not rule on the case until late spring 2018. While Comcast dropped out of the bidding for Fox assets, the cable TV firm is unlikely to stay on the sidelines.FANG (Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google) companies. Amazon, after acquiring Whole Foods to boost its retail distribution, could turn its attention to entertainment assets, some analysts speculate. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) acquired part of HTC's smartphone business in 2017 but the internet giant hasn't made a major acquisition since smart device maker Nest Labs in 2014.Google's cloud computing business might benefit from acquiring a large software company, but most analysts doubt that will happen. Google instead partnered with Salesforce.com (CRM) last year. Facebook, meanwhile, is likely to remain focused on small deals in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.Semiconductors. Broadcom's hostile bid for Qualcomm is shaping up as an epic battle. One wild card: whether Qualcomm can first close its purchase of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Elliott Advisors, an activist hedge fund, is pressuring Qualcomm to up its offer.Nvidia (NVDA), though cash-rich, has shied away from big deals.  Xilinx (XLNX), though, makes a good fit for Nvidia, KeyBanc Capital speculates.  Either Nvidia or Xilinx, meanwhile, could make an offer for Ambarella (AMBA), analysts say.Romit Shah, an analyst at Nomura Instinet, says a M&A wave among midcap stocks is possible in 2018. ""The sweet spot, in our opinion, is companies in the $1 billion to $15 billion market cap range,"" he said in a report. ""These companies include Dialog Semiconductor (DLG), Diodes (DIOD), Macom Technology (MTSI), Maxim Integrated (MXIM), MaxLinear (MXL), and Microsemi (MSCC).""Payments. Vantiv (VNTV) acquired U.K.-based Worldpay in July, marking the sector's biggest 2017 deal. There's speculation that PayPal Holdings (PYPL), with $6 billion in cash, could target Europe's Adyen. James Faucette, a Morgan Stanley analyst, says the pace of M&A picked up in the payments industry in 2017. ""We see no signs of the trend abating especially as tax reform could help efficient cash repatriation and make funds available for deployment (i.e. PayPal),"" he said in a report.Software. A tax holiday on overseas profits brought to the U.S. should give Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL) more cash to make acquisitions. Other companies with ample cash on their balance sheets include VMware (VMW), Adobe Systems (ADBE),  ServiceNow (NOW), Red Hat (RHT) and security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW). For many buyers, the focus is expected to be on fast-growing software-as-a-service companies. The customers of SaaS vendors purchase renewable subscriptions, rather than one-time, perpetual software licenses.Cloud computing data centers. The sector has been busy with Digital Realty (DLR) buying DuPont Fabros and Equinix (EQIX) acquiring data centers from Verizon.  Equinix continued its buying spree in late December, purchasing Australia's Metronode. Europe-based InterXion Holding (INXN) could be targeted, says Oppenheimer.RELATED:Wall Street Analysts Identify Top Chip Takeover Targets For 2018These Stunning Stats Reveal Epic Netflix-Amazon-Hulu-Apple War To Come2018 Stock Market Outlook: What To Watch For In The New Year

It is one of six chip industry players on the list.Elsewhere in the semiconductor sector, BMO Capital Markets analyst Ambrish Srivastava raised his price target on Xilinx (XLNX) to 80 from 71.

"
39,XLNX,"The rumored merger of Qualcomm (QCOM) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) has received an upbeat response from Wall Street analysts.The possible deal, reported to be in the works by Dow Jones on Thursday, would create the second-largest chip company by revenue after Intel (INTC).Qualcomm stock ended trading up 1.6% to close at 68.50 on the stock market today. On Thursday, it rose 6.3%.NXP stock soared to a 6.1% gain to 102.01 and at a 15-month high, after jumping 17% Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: Big mergers come with big risks, and many never pan out. An example of a huge deal that so far is working out is Broadcom's $37 billion acquisition of Avago Technologies, completed Feb. 1. Broadcom currently ranks No. 39 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing public companies. More than that, Broadcom is among IBD's Sector Leaders.Investment bank Mizuho raised its rating on Qualcomm stock to buy from neutral, with a price target of 75.Cowen hiked its price target on Qualcomm to 74 from 62 and reiterated its outperform rating.A Qualcomm-NXP merger ""could be truly transformational,"" Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri said in a research report.""We love this potential deal. Hopefully it happens,"" Arcuri said. ""We've been writing about it for about 12 months.""An acquisition of NXP would help Qualcomm diversify beyond mobile phone chips. The deal would give Qualcomm exposure to the automotive, industrial and Internet of Things markets, Arcuri said.The only other potential bidder for NXP would be Broadcom (AVGO), Arcuri said. But Xilinx (XLNX) would be a better acquisition for Broadcom to make, he said.Purchasing NXP would allow Qualcomm to become an end-to-end chip supplier to the automotive market.""Qualcomm dominates automotive telematics and we believe the potential acquisition of NXP will give it in-cockpit market share, powertrain, safety, and an automotive processor portfolio from Freescale Semiconductor that creates the first end-to-end semiconductor auto supplier of the future,"" Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh said in a report.Rakesh also reiterated his buy rating on NXP, with a price target of 120.Qualcomm acquiring NXP would make strategic sense, Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha said in a report. But a large acquisition would be uncharacteristic of Qualcomm, he said.""Management has mentioned on a number of occasions that they gravitate toward smaller, tuck-in acquisitions,"" Garcha said.Qualcomm's two largest acquisitions to date were its $2.4 billion purchase of CSR in 2015 and $3.1 billion purchase of Atheros Communications in 2011. By comparison, NXP has a market capitalization of about $35 billion.Qualcomm is considering other acquisition targets as well, Garcha said. They could include Mellanox (MLNX), Xilinx, Qorvo (QRVO), Cavium (CAVM) and Silicon Laboratories (SLAB).Garcha rates Qualcomm stock as outperform, with a price target of 70.RELATED:NXP Semiconductors Rockets On Qualcomm Acquisition Report

Entegris (ENTG) had a milder move but still rose above the 27.20 buy point of a lopsided cup with handle. Volume was well below average.Barron's, quoting a Keybanc Capital Markets analyst, reported that Integrated Device will benefit from wireless charging in Apple's (AAPL) new smartphones. While Broadcom will provide the wireless charging, Integrated Device stands to benefit because Chinese handset makers may also move to adopt wireless charging, and the company has design deals with those manufacturers.Performance Food Group (PFGC) broke out past the 29.35 buy point of a base in heavy trading and remained in buy range.

50,XLNX,"Shares of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) soared Thursday on a report that the company might be acquired by Qualcomm (QCOM).NXP stock shot up as much as 19% on the stock market today, matching a 14-month high of 98.09, and ended the day up 17%, at 96.12. Qualcomm stock rose 6%, to 67.23.Dow Jones said a deal could be struck in the next two to three months.

Qualcomm didn't immediately return a request for comment.IBD'S TAKE: Big mergers often come with big challenges, and many never pan out. For an example of huge deal that so far is working out, look no further than the latest IBD 50 ranking of top-performing stocks over the past 52 weeks. Broadcom, a product of a merger completed early this year between Broadcom and Avago, resides at No. 46. More than that, Broadcom also is among IBD's Sector Leaders.Headquartered in the Netherlands, NXP makes high-performance mixed-signal processors for communications, security, automotive and industrial applications. Among its biggest customers are Apple (AAPL), Bosch, Ericsson (ERIC), Huawei, Hyundai, Nokia (NOK) and Samsung.If the NXP-Qualcomm merger occurs, it would be part of a wave of consolidation occurring in the chip sector.In May, disk drive maker Western Digital completed its $19 billion acquisition of flash chip company SanDisk. On Feb. 1, the biggest chip merger ever -- biggest merger of two tech companies ever -- was completed between Avago and Broadcom (AVGO), with the $37 billion combination taking the Broadcom name but keeping the Avago AVGO stock ticker. And in December, NXP completed its own huge deal, acquiring Freescale Semiconductor in a transaction valued near $12 billion.Qualcomm has been among chip companies reportedly looking for acquisitions, with Xilinx (XLNX) among companies it reportedly had eyed.RELATED:Apple Supplier NXP Parlays Freescale M&A To Outpace IndustryBig Chip-Gear Merger Points To Chip Field's Active M&A Environment

51,XLNX,"Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), which has been trading at record highs the past month, filed a routine S-3 shelf registration statement on Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission that investment bank Nomura says could be a harbinger of possible acquisitions.The filing gives no amount nor does it indicate that any sale is on the way, but it does open the door for Nvidia to make any number of stock or bond sales. And while the company says proceeds could be used for acquisitions, it has the standard boilerplate language that basically says the proceeds could be used for pretty much anything. Nvidia did not respond to IBD's request for comment.Nomura analyst Romit Shah, however, points out in a research note Friday that Nvidia's balance sheet already is ""one of the strongest in our coverage universe."" He says the filing was ignored by investors, and possibly with good reason, but writes that ""overall, it reads to us as though management is considering something more than just housekeeping.""IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia has had a strong six months, and ranks No. 9 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks over the past 12 months, with an emphasis on the most recent six months. IBD's flagship screen of leading growth stocks is a key tool for investors.Shah said it's unlikely that Nvidia would be looking to buy a pair of chip companies that have been subject to takeover rumors, Xilinx (XLNX) and Cavium (CAVM). But he also said that while acquisitions generally are not in Nvidia's DNA, it ""could very well pursue a software company.""""We believe though that Nvidia would only seriously pursue businesses that are a good strategic fit; thus, improving the company's presence in nongaming markets such as data center, artificial intelligence and automotive,"" he wrote.Nvidia is best known as a maker of graphics chips popular in gaming, but it has a noted partnership with electric-car company Tesla (TSLA) and is expanding in other areas as well.The chipmaker reported $4.9 billion in cash and equivalents as of the end of its fiscal Q2, July 31.Nvidia stock plunged 5% to close at 59.52 on the stock market today, near 60.50 and at a one-month low, in a down day for the market overall.

It has earned a place on the IBD 50 list of superior stocks.""Longer term, we like Broadcom for its dominant/diversified semiconductor portfolio and significant free-cash-flow potential,"" Schafer said in a research report. ""We see ample upside as management executes on merger synergies and likely future accretive M&A.""On Monday, MKM analyst Ian Ing posited that Broadcom could seek a merger with Qualcomm (QCOM). Other possible M&A targets for Broadcom include Xilinx (XLNX), Cavium (CAVM) and Marvell Technology (MRVL), Ing said.Also Monday, RBC Capital Markets raised its price target for Broadcom to 190 from 185 and continued to call it a ""Top Pick.""Schafer is predicting a beat-and-raise Q3 report from Broadcom, with upside coming from ""significant content growth"" in Apple's (AAPL) upcoming iPhone 7. He estimates that Broadcom's chip content in the iPhone 7 is up about 30% over the iPhone 6S.""Even in the bear case with Apple units down 10%-20% year over year, Broadcom could still post double-digit iPhone-related growth,"" Schafer said.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Broadcom to earn $2.77 a share excluding items on sales of $3.76 billion in the July quarter. On a year-over-year basis, earnings per share are seen rising 24% with sales up 115%. Broadcom is two quarters into its massive $37 billion combination with the former Avago Technologies.For the current quarter, Wall Street is modeling for Broadcom to earn $3.19 a share excluding items, up 27%, on sales of $4.06 billion, up 119%.On Tuesday, Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer reiterated his outperform rating on Broadcom and upped his price target to 200 from 180.RELATED:Broadcom Likely Gained 20% Apple iPhone 7 Content Despite 'Muted' Ramp
"
53,XLNX,"Broadcom (AVGO) will deliver a $50 million beat over Wall Street's fiscal Q3 views, helped by 20% Apple (AAPL) iPhone 7 gains and better-than-expected wired growth, Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer predicted Tuesday.Still, Broadcom stock -- which early Tuesday touched a record high for the fifth day in the past seven trading days -- by one measure is cheap relative to its peers. It's up 15% since its fiscal Q2 report on June 2, which is in line with the much-followed Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX). But IBD's 41-company Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless industry group is up 19% over that same period.For fiscal Q3 ended in July, Pitzer expects Broadcom to top consensus views for $3.76 billion in sales and $2.77 earnings per share ex items by $50 million and 5 cents, respectively. Broadcom is slated to report its fiscal Q3 earnings after the close Thursday.The beat will be ""driven by strong content gains and initial builds for the iPhone 7, a recovery in enterprise storage, better-than-expected growth in wired ... and likely continued operating expenses improvements,"" Pitzer wrote in a research report Tuesday.Pitzer boosted his price target on Broadcom stock to 200 from 180, reiterating an outperform rating on the stock. He's even more bullish on October-quarter sales, modeling a $50 million and 10 cent upside on the same catalysts.He models 20% Apple iPhone 7 gains, but says Broadcom could see content soar by as much as 30%-40%. Broadcom supplies a power amplifier module for the iPhone 6S, which debuted in September 2015, according to a teardown from iFixit.That will come as Apple reportedly cuts component orders for its iPhone 7 by 15%-20%, Pacific Crest analysts predicted last week. Broadcom, Analog Devices (ADI) and InvenSense (INVN) will withstand the haircut, thanks to other trends, the analysts said.Meanwhile, investors are eyeing Broadcom's penchant for accretive M&A.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom is two quarters into its $37 billion behemoth combination with the former Avago Technologies. Before that, though, Avago had a strong history of making deals to further its growth.But Pitzer isn't as ready to jump on the Broadcom M&A bandwagon. On Monday, an MKM analyst posited Broadcom could seek a merger with Qualcomm (QCOM), though Xilinx (XLNX), Cavium (CAVM) or Marvell Technology (MRVL) would also fit the bill.""While M&A continues to be a focus for value creation (and management has a strong track record), we believe that a more balanced total returns story (buyback, dividend, debt pay down), would perhaps drive more equity value,"" he wrote.At the closing bell on the stock market today, Broadcom shares edged down 0.2% to 177. Broadcom, an IBD 50 stock, is now 7% extended from a buy point at 166.10 out of a cup formation achieved July 27.RELATED:Apple Schedules Sept. 7 Event For iPhone 7 RevealBendgate Repeated?

54,XLNX,"Xilinx (XLNX), Cavium (CAVM) and Marvell Technology (MRVL) fit the bill for Broadcom's (AVGO) anticipated future M&A plans, but a ""merger of equals"" with fellow Apple (AAPL) supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) is also possible, MKM analyst Ian Ing said Monday.Any such merger would follow Broadcom's early February combination with the former Avago Technologies for $37 billion. In June, CEO Hock Tan said Broadcom will soon begin pulling excess cash for M&A.Meanwhile, Broadcom stock is range-bound as it mulls its M&A opportunities, Ing wrote in a research report. Ing kept his buy rating and 188 price target on Broadcom stock Monday ahead of the company's fiscal Q3 earnings report, due out late Thursday.""Investors now focus on how quickly they can do another accretive acquisition,"" he said. ""Our concerns center around the lack of remaining attractive deals available, given the framework of asset-light and OEM customer focus.""Broadcom could go after Qualcomm, he said, though Qualcomm's $92 billion market cap dwarfs Broadcom's $70.5 billion cap, and ""powerful smartphone customers may not embrace a single supplier across both 'digital baseband' and RF (radio frequency) content.""The duo supply chips for Apple iPhones. Apple's newest flagship handset, the iPhone 7, is expected to be unveiled Sept. 7.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom is expected to survive Apple's rumored 15%-20% component order cut for iPhone 7 supplies, according to Pacific Crest analysts.Ing cut his fiscal Q3 wireless view to 26% sequential growth, implying $997.9 million, or 26% of his total $3.79 billion revenue forecast. For the October quarter, he sees $1.25 billion in wireless sales, about 30% of total sales, as the iPhone 7 ramps.He expects wired sales to benefit from new product cycles in Tomahawk switching and Jericho routing.Analysts model $3.76 billion and $4.05 billion in fiscal Q3 and fiscal Q4 sales, respectively, for Broadcom. On a year-over-year basis, Broadcom's sales would grow 115% and 119%, respectively.On the stock market today, Broadcom stock rose 0.1% to 177.40. Shares are up 22% for the year and are 7% extended from a buy point at 166.10, out of a cup formation. Qualcomm stock rose 1 cent to 62.98.RELATED:Apple Schedules Sept. 7 Event For iPhone 7 Reveal

55,XLNX,"No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) will follow up the BMX bikers and mechanical spiders that populated last year's Intel Developer Conference with a fresh focus this week on autonomous driving, virtual reality and machine learning.The red-hot growth drivers have Intel rivaling fellow tech giants such as Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Tesla Motors (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO). Chipmakers are scrambling to target the next growth vector, as smartphone sales slow amid saturation.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom stock is ranked No. 1 in IBD's 41-company Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless industry group, with an IBD Composite Rating of 99, meaning it performs in the top 1% of all stocks. Broadcom is winning, analysts say, with its penchant for M&A. Get the IBD Stock Checkup here.IBD's 39-company Electronic-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group is up 10% this year amid the virtual reality and autonomous driving bonanza. Intel stock is flat for the year, but it's 6% extended from a 32.85 entry point out of a flat base achieved June 23.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Intel shares ended trading up 1% to 34.91.The 2016 Intel Developer Conference is set to kick off Tuesday, with CEO Brian Krzanich's keynote. The San Francisco conference will run through Thursday at the Moscone Center West.Last year, Krzanich's keynote featured a BMX biker outfitted with Intel's Curie chip, a six-axis sensor capable of capturing motion data from the handlebars and seat, as well as speed. This year, the company says Krzanich will share Intel's latest innovations and product demonstrations.Wednesday's keynotes are slated to highlight connected-world and data center/cloud infrastructure innovations. Both fit in well with the event's overarching theme -- virtual reality, autonomous driving, machine learning and the coming 5G broadband era.More than 140 businesses are expected to attend the three-day conference.On Thursday, Krzanich will also kick off the Intel SoC FPGA Developers Forum with a discussion of the importance of field-programmable gate arrays in the smart world. This event will be co-located within the Developers Conference. It will focus on FPGAs within the Internet of Things, data center, cloud computing, networking, industrial and automotive segments.Intel's FPGA unit stems largely from its Altera acquisition last year, with competitors that include Xilinx (XLNX).
"
56,XLNX,"Late Wednesday, No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) reported a 6-cent earnings beat and Q2 sales that were slightly shy of Wall Street expectations, as PC and Internet of Things sales slipped from Q1, slightly offset by double-digit growth in its Altera unit.Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said the chipmaker is on track as it shifts its focus toward data center, IoT and programmable chips. Intel is the longtime leader in microprocessors that power PCs, but that sector is in a downshift and more people move to smartphones. Intel plans to cut $750 million in costs this year, and three months ago it announced it would cut its workforce by 12,000.""We're gaining momentum heading into the second half,"" Krzanich said in the company's earnings release. ""While we remain cautious on the PC market, we're forecasting growth in 2016 built on strength in data center, the Internet of Things and programmable solutions.""Some of that played out in Q2. For the quarter, Intel reported $13.5 billion in sales, up 2.6%, and 59 cents earnings per share ex items, down 5%. The consensus of 41 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters called for $13.54 billion in revenue and EPS of 53 cents.Its PC unit's sales fell 3% both sequentially and vs. Q2 2015, which is largely in line with broad PC industry trends. Industry tracker IDC this month said PC shipments fell 4.5% year over year in Q2, but that beat its projection for a 7.4% plunge.But Intel's key IoT unit saw sales fall 12% sequentially, though they rose 2% from the year-earlier quarter. Nonvolatile memory sales fell 1% quarter over quarter and 20% vs. last year.Programmable solutions, on the other hand, flew 30% sequentially. Intel acquired field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-maker Altera this year, a combination that some analysts say could rival Xilinx (XLNX) in FPGAs.Intel's data center sales lifted 5% year over year but fell 1% from Q1.Current-quarter guidance for $14.9 billion in sales ex items, plus or minus $500 million, beat analyst views for $14.6 billion. Intel didn't provide an EPS guide. Analysts model 64 cents, which would be flat.In after-hours trading, after releasing earnings, Intel stock was down 1%. Shares closed Wednesday's regular session up 1.5%, at 35.69. Shares are up 4% for the year on speculation that Apple (AAPL) might tap Intel to source some of its iPhone 7 modems, partially replacing incumbent Qualcomm (QCOM).
"
57,XLNX,"It seems Broadcom (AVGO) just can't resist making merger deals -- whether joining forces with another company or shedding some of its own operations.The supplier to Apple (AAPL) iPhones seemed set after making its mammoth $37 billion deal to merge with Avago earlier this year. In March, a mere month after the transaction closed, Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan spurned any talk of future transactions. Tan told analysts a merger or acquisition was the ""furthest thing"" from his mind.That was then. Tan's tune changed a couple months later when he told analysts on the June 2 second-quarter conference call that Broadcom will pull excess cash for mergers, as gross debt is close to double its adjusted earnings. Broadcom, the No. 2 fabless chipmaker, is still trying to buffer itself from volatile smartphone sales and angle for the more stable wired segment.Analysts say the merger strategy is working. Morgan Stanley's Craig Hettenbach notes the company now has greater diversification, with a hand in wireless, wired, enterprise storage and industrial segments.""The ebb and flow between Broadcom's end markets has allowed the company to meet revenue expectations in recent quarters despite the overriding demand weakness that has had a negative impact on most peers,"" Hettenbach wrote in a June 3 research report.Broadcom is far from new to the merger block. In fact, the company has changed hands several times itself since it was founded in 1961 as a semiconductor division under Hewlett-Packard. It left when Agilent Technologies (A) split from the company in 1999.Six years later, KKR and Silver Lake paid $2.6 billion to acquire the division of Agilent that later became Avago. Before going public in 2009, Avago sold one of its divisions to PMC-Sierra. PMC, in turn, was acquired early this year by Microsemi (MSCC).Eight years of rampant merger deals followed. In 2013, Avago acquired optical chip supplier CyOptics for $400 million and storage/networking firm LSI for $6.6 billion. Meanwhile, Avago peeled off several layers of its own by selling divisions to Intel (INTC) and Seagate Technology (STX). Then it turned the tables and bought Emulex in 2015 for $606 million.Earlier this year, Broadcom divested its Internet of Things and wireless infrastructure units to Cypress Semiconductor (CY) and MaxLinear (MXL) in deals worth a combined $630 million. Broadcom is likely to use those proceeds to pay down debt before seeking another deal.But the Big Kahuna was Avago's merger with the former Broadcom. That acquisition wrapped in February and was one of a number of chip-sector deals worth a cumulative $115 billion. (Intel bought Altera for $17 billion, and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) took on Freescale Semiconductors for $12 billion.)Combined, the new company kept Broadcom's name but used Avago's ticker, AVGO. The move helped it to diversify, and analysts thus changed their tune on the stock. In 2017, RBC analyst Amit Daryanani expects Broadcom to make a play for larger assets like Maxim Integrated (MXIM), NXP or Xilinx (XLNX).At least 16 analysts rated Broadcom stock a buy in the week following its Q2 earnings release, the first quarter in which the two companies were consolidated. Meanwhile, shareholders busted Broadcom stock out of a cup formation on June 3. Shares rocketed 7.7% before dipping almost immediately into a second cup. Broadcom stock topped a 166 entry point on July 27, but it has since pulled back.Broadcom shares ended Friday trading at a new all-time high of 170.12, up 1.9%, but lost some ground Monday. Shares finished Monday's trades down 1% to 168.35.Wireless sales accounted for a mere 22% of total revenue -- dipping below 30% for the first time in seven quarters. Broadcom's smartphone-facing unit accounted for 37% of sales in 2015. In 2014 and 2013, wireless revenue was 42% and 49% of total sales.Despite slowing importance to Broadcom's overall scheme, Tan hinted that radio-frequency content for smartphones has increased and would likely continue to rise by 20% annually for the next two to three years. That means even as smartphone units slow, Broadcom could see its take per phone grow.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom tops IBD's 41-company Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry group. The group has climbed to No. 20 out of 197 groups tracked from No. 74 two months ago. Get Broadcom's IBD Stock Checkup here.UBS analyst Stephen Chin estimates that Broadcom could see its dollar content per unit boost to $8-$10 in the long term. Growth will come from additional content at existing tier-one smartphone makers like Apple and Samsung and as more infrastructure comes online to support 4G and LTE devices worldwide.""This could drive the need for additional FBAR (film bulk acoustic resonator) filters,"" Chin wrote in a July 15 research report. FBAR filters are a common component used in advanced smartphones. The filters account for about 12% of Broadcom's sales, Chin estimated.Broadcom's three-year agreement with Apple for chips ""suggests it will remain the FBAR market leader,"" Chin said. In a July 8 note to clients, RBC's Daryanani estimated that Broadcom's Apple-tied sales could grow more than 15% over the next three years.Diversification is key for RF suppliers like Broadcom, Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO), which are jockeying for position as mobile sales stagnate. Vendors shipped 343.3 million smartphones in the second quarter, flat vs. last year, industry tracker IDC wrote in a July 28 note. Sequentially, smartphone shipments were up 3.1% from the first quarter.Still, mobile giants like Apple are changing their game to focus on services, IDC analyst Ryan Reith says. As smartphone makers shift strategies, so too do chipmakers.For Broadcom that means greater emphasis on its wired segment, which made up 58% of sales in the second quarter, accelerating from 22% of sales in the first quarter. Its previous three-year quarterly average in that unit was 22% of sales. Broadcom has beat Wall Street's total sales expectations for the past seven quarters.Broadcom's wired unit is largely enterprise-facing. The segment includes Broadcom's Tomahawk chips for cloud-scale networking and its Jericho platform for routing. Jericho will drive additional upside to top-line expectations for the third quarter, UBS' Chin said.""We estimate Jericho has started ramping recently and there is virtually no alternative chip supplier in the market,"" he wrote. ""The main competition is from networking OEM internal ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) designs.""

58,XLNX,"ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Fund (SBLGX) makes a habit of staying on top. The now-$3.5 billion portfolio's 15.72% average annual return over the five years ended July 29 ranked No. 5 among all large-cap growth funds tracked by Morningstar Inc.It was also in the top 3% and top 5% among its direct rivals over the past 12 months and three years.How does the fund do it? Co-manager Peter Bourbeau, who has been at the helm since July 15, 2009, says he and Margaret Vitrano -- co-manager since Oct. 11, 2012 -- stick to a few techniques, including investing in just their best ideas and investing in not one but several types of growth stocks.The results speak loud and clear. Their fund was in the top 33% of all U.S. diversified stock mutual funds last month. And their track record has made them an IBD Best Mutual Funds of 2016 award winner. The fund outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31.Forty-eight-year-old Bourbeau, who is based in Manhattan, spoke with IBD about his investment approach, while he was on the road in Nashville, Tenn.IBD: Peter, you hold three types of growth stocks: cyclical, stable and what you call select. Why not just focus on one?Bourbeau: We believe different types of growth companies will perform better at various stages of a market cycle. We seek to deliver solid performance through the full cycle by owning a diversified portfolio of growth companies which we divide into three categories of growth stocks or buckets: stable, cyclical and select.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersThe select bucket of growth stocks -- which has about 35% of our assets -- are elite growers with disruptive technologies or business models. These are growing earnings at a double-digit rate. We base our growth projections on the size of the addressable market. Facebook (FB), for instance, will only invest in new opportunities that represent 1 billion or more potential users. These companies often look expensive because many of them, like Amazon (AMZN) with aggressive capital spending on its web services business, invest heavily to support future growth. This focus on long-term value creation tends to make them volatile.The stable bucket has about 50% to 65% of our assets. These are stocks like Home Depot (HD) and Microsoft (MSFT). They are industry-leading companies that are growing earnings slightly above average on a very consistent basis. It's this long-term compounding of earnings and cash flows which gives these companies so many options to create shareholder value such as stock buybacks, acquisitions or dividend payments.Comcast (CMCSA), for example, recently announced the acquisition of DreamWorks Animation (DWA). Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) last year purchased SABMiller. Disney (DIS) has the cash to expand its theme parks globally with the opening of a park in Shanghai.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceOur cyclical-stocks bucket has companies whose revenue or profits are depressed for reasons that we think are fixable. Cyclical growers maintain the growth characteristics that we look for, but have issues with a visible inflection point. As patient, long-term investors, we can take advantage of price dislocations caused by near-term headwinds to establish new positions or dollar cost average into existing positions at attractive valuations.Schlumberger (SLB) and Grainger (GWW) are two. American Express (AXP) has faced revenue pressure on the top end by (JPMorgan) Chase (JPM) and Visa (V), and on the bottom by Capital One (COF) and Discover (DFS).IBD: And why do you prefer to be concentrated?Bourbeau: We usually have 40 to 50 names. We're around 47 now. We have 15% annual turnover, so we hold for eight to 10 years on average.We're concentrated because we're looking for the No. 1 leader in a market. Those companies have the highest margins, best free cash flow. They take over weaker companies. They become bigger and more powerful, harder to compete with. They have visionary men and women. Great companies remain great for a long time. Who needs the No. 2 or 3 company?IBD: Give me an example, please, as of your latest disclosure.Bourbeau: Sure. Schlumberger's rivals include Halliburton (HAL) (in oilfield services) and Baker Hughes (BHI) (in oil & gas machinery). But Schlumberger is three times bigger than Halliburton (in terms of market capitalization), its nearest rival in oil field services. (And more than five times the size of Baker Hughes.) It is by far the leader in products, distribution, margins. It is the favorite partner of exploration and production companies and integrated multinationals.IBD: What's your Facebook thesis?Bourbeau: Its rare business model takes advantage of the move of advertising from old media to new and to mobile from the desktop.They bought WhatsApp, they've got Messenger, they've got Instagram. And look at what they've done with video. They're building apps for billions of users as opposed to some of their smaller competitors.If you're an advertiser, you're getting targeting that you never had before. It can be refined down to age, demographic, gender, likes and dislikes. Your ads' effectiveness goes higher. And Facebook is just beginning this movement.IBD: Is Amazon the same -- one innovation building on another?Bourbeau: You're frustrated as investors, seeing huge ramp-ups in capital expenditures. But you know they're also seeing opportunities that we mere mortals could never see. Amazon Web Services started as a pet project for their retail operation. They built an infrastructure that they used maybe one month a year, then they wondered how to use it the rest of the year, and it grew 50%, 60%, 70%. They created an industry, renting software vs. buying it, which (Amazon founder and CEO) Jeff Bezos says will be bigger than retail.What's next? We don't know. Logistics? Moving packages around the world? Not all of their innovations will work. And we're aware of stretched valuations. But an innovative company with $10 billion in free cash flow gives us no reason to be alarmed.IBD: You boosted your stake in VMware (VMW) not long ago. Why?Bourbeau: This is another innovative company that created an entire business, which is server virtualization. Now, that's the mature part of their business. They still have a massive lead, but that will erode over time.They have another suite of products. And creating an easy user experience to a hybrid cloud is something they're going to have a leadership position in. They made acquisitions in network virtualization. One was Nicira (in 2012). They've got deployment to paying customers. The value proposition vs. Cisco Systems (CSCO) is early, but if it works it will be a massive home run.To be balanced, the Dell acquisition (of EMC (EMC), which owns a stake in VMware) was unfortunate. Structuring the deal with tracking stock (that mimicked shares of VMware) punished equity in VMware and made a messy transition. But we're finally toward the tail end of that. VMware will operate as a public company.It has double-digit free cash flow yield. It is a very cheap asset. They've got a huge buyback in place. It is a name we continue to like.IBD: Another position you've boosted is Xilinx (XLNX). Why?Bourbeau: This is an interesting company. They don't own their own manufacturing. They design intricate, high-power chips for very particular applications like cell towers, moving massive data, programmable logic device (PLD) chips that can handle enormous amounts of instructions and can change instructions on a chip remotely.They're used in defense. There are 17 PLD chips in the Mercedes S-class cars. And the fact that they don't manufacture them means this is almost a software company in terms of margins. Lastly, this was a duopoly. But Intel (INTC) bought Altera, so Xilinx could be an acquisition target down the road, not that's that what we're playing for.IBD: Cyclicals that you like or added to recently -- American Express, Schlumberger, VMWare, Xilinx: only VMWare has average growth of 10% or faster in the last three and five years. Only Schlumberger has expected earnings north of 10% in 2017. Do these companies need faster growth to get their stocks moving? When will that happen?Bourbeau: Growth rates are not the main criteria with cyclical stocks. We target an inflection point for each. If reached, it should cause earnings to normalize and stock valuation to increase.Here are their inflection points. For SLB, they include crude oil prices reaching supply-demand equilibrium and global production ramping up. Also, 65% incremental margins, which is a lot higher than any other recovery. For AXP: normalization of business post Costco (which no longer accepts AmEx cards). Normal earnings growth rate should return in 2017. XLNX: product cycle and further application penetration as well as market share gains. VMW: we don't have a comment.IBD: How do you and Margaret Vitrano divide duties, running this fund?Bourbeau: We don't divide up the portfolio. We're devoted to the same process. But we each have a slight bias in our knowledge bases. Margaret, given her consumer discretionary and technology background, has different experiences from my health care and financials background. But when we look at companies, we're on the same calls at the same time. Our different backgrounds helps us fact-check each other.IBD: And who was your mentor, Peter?Bourbeau: The first was Richie Freeman, who has run ClearBridge Aggressive Growth (SHRAX) (since 1983, and whose co-manager now is Evan Bauman). We talk every day. He's just down the hall. We're constantly talking ideas, sports.But our portfolio construction is now a little different. Richie's turnover is zero. When he's comfortable with a name, he's on it forever. Margaret and I are more disciplined in valuation. Our turnover is 15%, which makes Richie's fund look like a hedge fund.If you look at sectors, Richie and Evan are eclectic. Richie is more likely to have zero in a given sector if he doesn't like it. That's not how Margaret and I look at the world. We have industrials, media (and something in every sector). And Richie can have significant overweights. And he is more all-market-capitalizations. Margaret and I are more large cap.

59,XLNX,"Wall Street analysts on Monday raised their price targets on a bunch of top-performing chip stocks, including Nvidia (NVDA) and Microchip Technology (MCHP).XNvidia and Microchip are both on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks. The list currently includes three chipmakers and three semiconductor capital equipment suppliers.Needham reiterated its buy rating on graphics-chip maker Nvidia and raised its price target to 200 from 130. Jefferies maintained its buy rating on Nvidia and upped its price target to 180 from 140.Mizuho Securities kept its neutral rating on Microchip, but increased its price target to 82 from 80.Nvidia soared 4.7% to 153.70 on the stock market today. Microchip rose 0.5% to 78.76.IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news on chip stocks, visit IBD's news page Chip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News.Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill increased his price target on Nvidia stock on expectations that the company's recent deal with Toyota Motor (TM) will generate ""meaningful revenue over the next 24 months.""Toyota is using Nvidia chip sets for advanced driver assistance systems and eventually self-driving cars.Gill estimates that the Toyota deal could generate an incremental $1 billion to $1.7 billion in revenue and 35 to 65 cents in earnings per share over 2.5 years.Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis sees Nvidia as a ""key beneficiary of the 4th Tectonic Shift in Computing"" because it supplies systems for deep learning applications.""Nvidia's decadelong investment in CUDA, its proprietary GPU-processing language has resulted in a multiyear competitive advantage, that has yet to be fully appreciated by investors,"" Lipacis said in a note to clients. Nvidia is a leader in graphics processing units, or GPUs.Previous shifts in computing included the move from mainframes to minicomputers, minicomputers to PCs, and PCs to mobile phones and data centers. The latest shift is to parallel processing, artificial intelligence and the internet of things, Lipacis said.In addition to Nvidia, other chipmakers likely to benefit from the growth of parallel processing include Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Cavium (CAVM) and Xilinx (XLNX), he said.Lipacis upgraded Cavium and Xilinx to buy from hold. He raised his price target on Cavium to 79 from 73 and upped his price target on Xilinx to 77 from 68.Likely beneficiaries of the internet-of-things trend include Analog Devices (ADI), Microchip Technology, Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) and Texas Instruments (TXN).Intel (INTC) has ""the most to lose"" in the shift from traditional data centers to parallel processing and internet of things. As such, Lipacis downgraded Intel stock to underperform from hold and slashed his price target to 29 from 38.Intel dropped 0.7% to 33.65 on Monday.Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh updated his ratings on a host of semiconductor stocks on Monday.He raised his price targets on AMD, Microchip, Texas Instruments and Xilinx, but cut his target on Qorvo (QRVO).Rakesh reiterated his buy rating on AMD and upped his price target to 15 from 14. AMD is seen benefiting from second-half 2017 game console sales and improved demand for PCs and graphics processors.Microchip is continuing to see strong orders from automotive and industrial markets, Rakesh said.Texas Instruments also is benefiting from growth in the automotive and industrial markets. Rakesh rates TI as neutral, but upped his price target to 82 from 78.Xilinx is seeing opportunities in automotive and 5G wireless deployments, but trades at a premium multiple, Rakesh said. He rates Xilinx as neutral, but raised his price target to 68 from 64.Qorvo is likely to be impacted by near-term weakness in the China mobile phone market and faces high expectations for wireless revenue in the September quarter. Rakesh maintained his hold rating on Qorvo and cut his price target to 70 from 72.RELATED:Apple-Qualcomm Legal Dispute Likely To Be 'Long And Ugly'Chipmakers Microsemi, Skyworks Solutions Snare Fresh Buy Ratings

67,XLNX,"XThe Nasdaq composite led an uneventful session Thursday as Wall Street focused on another avalanche of earnings reports.Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Home Depot (HD) outperformed in the Dow with gains of around 1% each. Nasdaq 100 leaders included Intuit (INTU), Xilinx (XLNX) and PayPal (PYPL), with gains ranging from 6% to 8%.The Nasdaq composite led the way, helped in part by strength in chip-equipment stocks, up 0.4%. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 added less than 0.1%, weighed down by weakness in financials and oil and gas stocks. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in very close to Wednesday's levels.At the New York Mercantile Exchange, benchmark WTI crude oil futures settled near a four-week low, falling 0.9% to $49.18 a barrel.After the close, shares of Amazon.com (AMZN) jumped 4% after reporting earnings. Wall Street also eyed earnings from Alphabet (GOOGL), Fortinet (FTNT) and Western Digital (WDC).In the stock market today, Grubhub (GRUB) was a big winner, up nearly 23% to 42.95. First-quarter earnings and sales growth accelerated nicely from the fourth quarter, up 45% and 39% respectively. GrubHub's technical health improved quite a bit with a bullish gap above the 200-day moving average. It's only 3.7% off its high of 44.58 now.PayPal also had a good day, up 6% to 47.15. Headed into Thursday, it was still within buy range from a 43.90 buy point, but it's extended now. PayPal's Venmo social payment system has been a hit with the millennial crowd. It's basically a digital wallet that lets users make and share payments with friends. PayPal stock was unfazed by news that Apple (AAPL) is developing a similar product.Domino's Pizza (DPZ) gapped above its 50-day moving average, rising 2.5% to 185.55 on strong earnings. Its current flat base shows an early entry at 187.98. LogMeIn (LOGM) was a big gainer in the IBD 50, rising 3% to 113.50. It's been moving higher ahead of its May 4 earnings report after the close, but is still in buy range from a 110.10 buy point.Heavy-volume earnings gainers included enterprise software name ServiceNow (NOW) and small cap chip-equipment firm Ultra Clean Holdings (UCTT).ServiceNow gapped out of a base with a 94.82 buy point but ended slightly below the buy point. Shares rose nearly 4% to 94.32.Ultra Clean jumped 13% but it's well extended in price after a huge run-up in recent months.

"
68,XLNX,"SoftBank's (SFTBY) announcement late Sunday of its $32 billion deal to acquire Apple (AAPL) iPhone component supplier ARM Holdings (ARMH) could stoke further M&A activity, with top-five chipmakers -- Intel (INTC), Texas Instruments (TXN), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Broadcom (AVGO) -- cited as potential acquirers.Any company with a $10 billion to $15 billion market capitalization is on the table, says S&P Global Market Intelligence analyst Angelo Zino. Companies valued around $5 billion are in the ""sweet spot."" Recent rumors have targeted Xilinx (XLNX), which is valued above $12 billion.Marvell Technology (MRVL), Cavium (CAVM), Cypress Semiconductor (CY), Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) and Integrated Device Technology (IDTI) also fit the bill for possible acquisitions, Zino told IBD.Of IBD's 41-company Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry group, five names top $15 billion in market valuation: Qualcomm, Broadcom, ARM, Nvidia (NVDA) and NXP.At the close on the stock market today, ARM stock catapulted 40.6% to 66.17 and at an all-time high. That helped pull the IBD Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry group up 2%, hitting a 13-month high. Meanwhile, Apple gained 1.1% to 99.88. Qualcomm, which reports earnings later this week, also added 1.1%, and ended the day at 55.35. Broadcom advanced 0.7% to 162.33. Intel, which has struggled to enter the low-power microprocessor market dominated by ARM, ticked down 2 cents to 35.05.IBD'S TAKE: The Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry ranks No. 24 out of 197 groups tracked and includes leaders like Nvidia, the group's No. 1-ranked Monolithic Power Systems, Silicon Motion Technology, Broadcom and MaxLinear. All five have Composite Ratings of 99, meaning they perform in the top 1% of all stocks in key metrics such as earnings and sales growth.""Intel and Qualcomm are sitting on a hoard of cash, and both have concerns with regards to growth,"" Zino said. ""Broadcom, formerly Avago, has done a phenomenal job with acquisitions over the last three years. They're at a point now where they're looking to increase their war chest over the next 12 to 18 months.""Canaccord analyst Matt Ramsay puts Silicon Laboratories (SLAB), Cavium and GoPro (GPRO) supplier Ambarella (AMBA) on his potential takeover list, but says he doesn't see ARM as a target. U.K.-based ARM treats its licensees with a very ""vendor neutral approach"" and wasn't bandied on the typical rumor mill.""After last night's news, I wouldn't put anything (in M&A) past anybody,"" Ramsay told IBD. ""I don't think anything is off the table. Bigger companies buying differentiated tech is not off the table.""What's newer is companies doing more financial-engineering-type mergers, where it's a merger of equals to protect earnings growth and cash flow growth.""But 2016 M&A won't resemble the frenzy of 2015 chip-sector deals, when the value of M&As rocketed above $115 billion. In 2015, companies were buying innovation. Such was the case when Intel spent $16.7 billion to acquire field-programmable gate array (FPGA) maker Altera. This year, companies will be buying earnings leverage.""The semiconductor space has seen a dramatic slowdown in growth, and there's going to be a move by larger players to generate growth and earnings leverage via acquisitions,"" Ramsay said. ""You've got fairly healthy balance sheets across the sector here, and because of that, you're going to see more M&A.""Zino added: ""But in terms of dollar amount, you're not going to see what you saw in 2015 again.""Smartphone growth slowed to 10% in 2015 from 29% in 2014, Zino said. That's tugged at the bottom line for Apple iPhone suppliers like Qualcomm and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), which analysts expect to report a respective fifth and sixth quarter of decline later this week.This year, Zino expects smartphones to decelerate to 5%-6% growth. Canaccord's Ramsay is less bullish -- he views flat growth for 2016. For 2017, though, Apple's iPhone 8 ""super cycle"" could lend itself to 5% growth, Ramsay told IBD. And niche sectors like video, gaming and automotive will continue to growth.On the latter point, the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January used to be all about smartphones, but automotive and self-driving efforts by Apple, Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla Motors (TSLA) have pressed chipmakers into a new role, Ramsay says, noting, ""Now, there's a car in every booth.""
"
69,XLNX,"Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7 ramp and ""less bad"" PC sales will lead to an in-line second quarter for chipmakers, but Brexit-fostered macro worries could play out in October-quarter earnings, Credit Suisse and MKM analysts said Friday.Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer's top picks include Broadcom (AVGO), Intel (INTC), Analog Devices (ADI), Lam Research (LRCX), Microchip Technology (MCHP) and Mellanox Technologies (MLNX).""Importantly, (the second half of 2016) should be up 2.5% year over year after four quarters of year-over-year declines,"" Pitzer wrote in a research report. But overall he expects 2016 chip sales will be flat vs. earlier expectations for 3.8% growth.IBD's TAKE: IBD's 33-company Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment industry group is currently No. 48 out of 197 groups tracked, having made big moves over the last eight weeks from No. 169. It's led by ASML in market value, but KLA-Tencor tops the group in terms of Composite Rating. KLA has a CR of 92, meaning it outperforms 92% of all stocks in key metrics.Apple iPhone suppliers -- including Broadcom and Analog Devices -- could benefit from a ""lackluster iPhone 7 cycle"" still likely to grow 55%-60% from 80 million units shipped in the first half of the year.""Overall, handsets (are) better,"" he wrote. ""Slowing Samsung Galaxy S7 and weak high-end China (are) offset by mid- to low-end iPhone 7 builds.""More PC-oriented Intel and Microchip could benefit from marginal improvements in shipments, Pitzer wrote. During Q2, units declined 4.5% vs. last year, but topped the four-quarter average of a 12% decline. Still, expectations for PC builds to fall 8% this year would be conservative.Industrial trends improved modestly over the last 90 days, but appear seasonally weaker in the second half of 2016 -- likely impacting Lam. Lam, which is trying to acquire KLA-Tencor (KLAC), competes against ASML (ASML) and Applied Materials (AMAT) in the chip gear-making sector.Mellanox, on the other hand, could benefit in the second-half on infrastructure improvements by Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT). Mellanox's products are used to connect servers, provide storage and tie hyper-converged infrastructure -- a necessity for major cloud operations.The real risk is in Q3, when the effect of the U.K.'s decision to exit the European Union are likely to play out, Pitzer says. Global stock markets toppled on the Brexit vote and Q3 expectations that are already above seasonal quarter-over-quarter growth leave plenty of room for disappointment.MKM analyst Ian Ing sees the Brexit effect slugging Xilinx (XLNX), Texas Instruments (TXN), Intersil (ISIL), ON  Semiconductor (ON) and Analog Devices -- which have high distribution-channel sales ""which are a proxy for European and industrial market exposure.""Xilinx and Texas Instruments derive about 60% of their sales through the channel, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Intersil, ON and Analog Devices take in more than half of their revenue from distribution.""Industrial markets which are served by distributors are expected to have seasonally weaker second half of demand compounded by perceived Brexit risk and uncertainty,"" Ing wrote in a report. ""Q3 and Q4 are expected to be down seasonally and likely further exacerbated by customers' Brexit uncertainties.""The most obvious effect is in currency adjustments. Following the vote, the British pound fell 9.3% vs. the U.S. dollar to its lowest point in decades. The euro fell 1.6%. That could result in some inventory destocking followed by customers scrutinizing order run rates, Ing predicts.Competitively, U.S. semiconductors have a small advantage post-Brexit.""U.K. semiconductor markets were already soft before the Brexit event,"" Ing wrote. ""Longer term, we think Brexit has some offsetting impacts on U.K. semiconductor design and activity.""
"
70,XLNX,"No. 1 chipmaker Intel's (INTC) $16.7 billion Altera acquisition is ""unexciting"" and won't scoop Xilinx (XLNX) customers, M Science analyst Mark Bachman said Friday, three weeks after Xilinx forecast sub-10% long-term growth in the programmable-chip market.Intel isn't employing its 14-nanometer process to compete with Xilinx's 16-nm process for field-programmable gate array (FPGA) sales, a key synergy to undercutting Xilinx, Bachman wrote in a research report.""The typical FPGA customer is looking for a part that has significantly longer deployment than most integrated circuits,"" he wrote. ""As such, many FPGA customers prefer stability in their hardware providers -- this makes Altera's acquisition unexciting to some clients.""Intel's programmable-chip group will likely lose customers until it launches new solutions, such as integrated FPGAs and CPUs (central processing units) with high-level language optimization, Bachman wrote.Intel shares rose 0.3% on the stock market today, helped by reports that it would a contract to supply modem chips to Apple (AAPL) for the next iPhone.Xilinx dipped 0.6%.For fiscal Q2, Bachman expects Intel to report $13.51 billion in sales vs. the consensus of 44 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $13.53 billion. Bachman sees a sequential decline in PC sales to $7.21 billion, below broader views for $7.31 billion.Although he expects an uptick in data center and programmable solutions (Altera) sales, Bachman's model for $4.05 billion and $406 million, respectively, is below the consensus for $4.17 billion and $416 million.Bachman's consensus-lagging model follows Xilinx's late-May analyst day. Then, the programmable chipmaker said it expects $750 million in incremental opportunity through 2021. But that only represents a 6% compound annual growth rate.FPGAs aren't part of Intel's massive restructuring, announced in April, when the company reported fiscal Q1 sales that lagged expectations on tiny growth in the PC unit. Industry tracker IDC expects PC sales to slump 7.3% in 2016.Intel is stepping away from PCs to focus on high-growth segments such as data center, Internet of Things and memory. The company plans to cut 12,000 jobs and save $750 million to reinvest in those key growth areas.The data center is Intel's most important unit, Bachman says. But $4 billion in fiscal Q1 data center sales fell 7% sequentially and 9% vs. the year-earlier quarter. For fiscal Q2, Bachman's model would be a slight 1% uptick. But organic growth is going to be tricky.""Intel's monopoly in the segment gives it few options for inorganic growth,"" he wrote. ""Expansion of the mobile sector is, ironically, the most promising growth catalyst for Intel's data center group.""Mobile was Intel's money pit last year. Now, Intel is working to shed $800 million in mobile losses. In April, CEO Brian Krzanich said the company is ""absolutely on schedule"" in cutting its mobile losses.

71,XLNX,"XLate-session declines whittled Wednesday's moderate gains to a weak finish.Earnings disappointments were the leading culprit, gnawing away at the week's early momentum and grinding the Dow Jones industrial average's early 0.4% gain to a 0.1% decline. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq also shredded their gains, the Nasdaq ending flat and the S&P 500 down less than 0.1%.All the indexes remained firmly positive for the week.Compared to busy sessions Monday and Tuesday, Wednesday's action was comparatively quiet, with preliminary data showing trade slightly higher on the NYSE and slightly lower on the Nasdaq.At either end of the Dow industrials, United Technologies (UTX) rose nearly 2% and Procter & Gamble (PG) dropped 2%, both on quarterly results. United Tech remained in a buy range, 3% above a flat base buy point of 114.54. More than half of the Dow's stocks traded higher, with Verizon (VZ), Home Depot (HD) and Travelers (TRV) also posting gains of around 1%.Edwards Lifesciences (EW) easily led the S&P 500, pulsing more than 10% higher after reporting that strength in U.S. heart-valve replacements helped power a 32% first-quart earnings gain and a 27% rise in sales. Both numbers clobbered analyst expectations. The move hoisted shares back above the 40-week moving average as Edwards works on the right side of a six-month consolidation.Gains were more modest on the Nasdaq, led by a 3% advance by Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH). The gain put shares narrowly above a 52.60 buy point in two-month long a flat base.The low end of the Nasdaq was a different story, with Seagate Technologies (STX) gouging out a 16% loss. The maker of computer hard drives posted a 400% EPS gain, above analyst targets. But a 3% revenue advance stopped short of expectations. The loss sent shares below their 10-week moving average in heavy trade, triggering a sell signal.Hard-drive peer Western Digital (WDC) slipped 3% in strong trade. It reports earnings after the market closes on Thursday.The Leisure–Lodging group posted the strongest gain among industries as Wyndham Worldwide (WYN) spiked 9% to a record higher after turning in a powerful first-quarter performance and raising its full-year guidance. Shares ended the session 16% above a 86.82 buy point in a flat base.A heavy after hours reporting session Wednesday is scheduled to include reports from Las Vegas Sands (LVS), Citrix Systems (CTXS), Xylinx (XLNX), Amgen (AMGN), Equinix (EQIX) and others.RELATED:Trump Unveils Sweeping Tax Cut Plan; JPMorgan Says It Is 'Impossible'Las Vegas Sands Reports Late With Casino Stocks On A Hot Streak

72,XLNX,"Stocks opened higher Thursday as markets digested mixed earnings and economic news ahead of a significant after-hours reporting session.The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 rose 0.1% as the Nasdaq led with a 0.3% increase.Despite a weak finish Wednesday, the major indexes headed into Thursday's session in strong standing so far this week. The Dow industrials were up 2.1% and leaning toward their best weekly performance since early December. The Nasdaq composite is up 1.9% and tapping new highs. The S&P 500 opens with a 1.7% gain so far this week, and within a half percent of its March 1 record.Earnings reports were the driving factor in early action, but the premarket also felt some pressure from oil prices, with West Texas Intermediate down 2% to below $49 a barrel. Overseas markets may also factor into early action. Europe's markets were under pressure in afternoon trade, as London's FTSE 100 dropped 0.6% and Frankfurt's DAX slumped 0.5%.On the Dow, Cisco Systems (CSCO) rose 1% after Credit Suisse upgraded the stock to outperform. Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) fell 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively.Among the early moves on earnings news, Under Armour (UA) popped 7%. Xilinx (XLNX) leapt 6%.MKS Instruments (MKSI) rose 4.5% after the open. The maker of chip manufacturing gear reported a 234% gain in earnings per share and a 138% revenue surge in the first quarter, both numbers above analyst expectations. The company also hoisted its second-quarter earnings and revenue guidance to well above analyst targets. The stock is extended from a cup-with-handle breakout in November.Cloud-based software developer ServiceNow (NOW) strode 7% higher ahead of the open. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company reported after Wednesday's close its first-quarter earnings rose 167% and revenue climbed 36%, beating forecasts. The stock broke out from a base with a 94.82 buy point.Also in the early winners camp, PayPal Holdings (PYPL) was up nearly 6% after reporting late Wednesday a strong first quarter and a new $5 billion share buyback program. A 19% earnings advance and a 17% rise in earnings were enough to top analyst views, and management's full-year guidance was just above consensus targets. The stock is extended from a 43.90 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.Netherlands-based Yandex (YNDX) chalked up an early 5% advance. The operator of the most widely used search engine on Russia's internet reported better-than-expected results for the first quarter. The stock broke out past the 24.65 buy point in a cup with handle base.On the downside, American Airlines Group (AAL), Southwest Airlines (LUV) and Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) all posted sharp losses after their quarterly results.Mellanox Technologies (MLNX) drilled 18% lower after first-quarter earnings and revenue missed expectations by wide margins, and management lowered guidance to below views.F5 Networks (FFIV) cratered 8%, as fiscal second-quarter earnings and third-quarter earnings guidance missed analyst targets.Citrix Systems (CTXS) fell 2%. Citrix reported late Wednesday its first-quarter results met or narrowly beat analyst estimates, but second-quarter guidance was below views. Robert W. Baird upgraded the stock to outperform from neutral and raised the price target to 90 from 85.Thursday's heavyweight after-hours session is set to include reports from Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Starbucks (SBUX), among many others.Durable goods orders in March rose 0.7%, and were down 0.2% minus transportation, the Commerce Department estimated.  The estimates were a sharp downshift from February's 1.7% gain (up 0.4% minus transportation), and were well below consensus projections for an overall 1.1% increase and another 0.4% gain minus transportation.On the jobs front, 257,000 Americans filed first-time unemployment claims in the week ended April 22, according to the Labor Department.

73,XLNX,"X Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock fell below its 50-day moving average, a key technical support level, on Thursday after Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of the chipmaker with a sell rating.Elsewhere, MKM Partners initiated coverage on several chip stocks on Thursday, rating Marvell Technology (MRVL) and ON Semiconductor (ON) as buy and Xilinx (XLNX) as neutral.Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari set a price target of 11 on AMD, which tumbled by 6.4% to close at 13.27 on the stock market today.""While execution (i.e. new product launches, cost management and balance-sheet deleveraging) has improved under (Chief Executive) Lisa Su, we believe current risk-return is unfavorable,"" Hari said.AMD also is facing stiff competition from Intel (INTC) in central processing units and Nvidia (NVDA) in graphics processing units, he said.""We have a sell rating on AMD,"" Hari said. ""While we acknowledge the successful turnaround over the past few years, we find current valuation multiples difficult to justify as the market seems to have already priced in a sharp improvement in AMD's competitive and financial position.""MKM analyst Ruben Roy gave positive reviews to Marvell and ON Semi on Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: As the first-quarter earnings season approaches, IBD has identified several potential breakout stocks expecting 50%-plus earnings growth. That list includes three chip stocks.He set a price target of 20 on both Marvell and ON Semi.Marvell was up 0.7% to 15.10 and ON Semi was up 2% to 15.08 on Thursday.He set a neutral rating on Xilinx with a price target of 60.Xilinx was down 0.6% to 56.34 on Thursday.RELATED:Nvidia Stock Gets Price Target Cut On Near-Term Growth ChallengesMicrochip, Quantenna Rated Buy; Skyworks Gets Price Hike

74,XLNX,"XA powerful rebound Monday that left the Nasdaq at a new high and hefted the Dow industrials and S&P 500 back above the 50-day moving average for the first time since April 11 was only the start of the action.The Nasdaq vaulted 1.2%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.1%. Small caps slightly outpaced the general action, with the Russell 2000 notching a 1.3% gain.Up next is an after-hours reporting session with earnings reports from Whirlpool (WHR), Barrick Gold (ABX) and Range Resources (RRC), setting the tone for a week jammed with economic and political news, and in which more than 190 S&P 500 and a dozen Dow-listed stocks are set to report earnings. Alcoa (AA) was up 1% in extended trading following its results. Express Scripts (ESRX) also announced results and was unchanged.The first-round presidential vote in France on Sunday set up a second round between far-right-wing candidate Marine Le Pen and centrist challenger Emmanuel Macron, scheduled for May 7.  Macron's victory and his strength in polls ahead of the second-round vote eased some investor concerns that France was headed for an exit from the European Union, a move that could threaten the union.Stocks also received a boost from the White House, where news reports said President Trump had called for a tax plan by Wednesday that prioritized trimming the corporate tax rate to 15% over holding down the deficit.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn are scheduled to meet with key GOP congressional leaders to discuss the plan on Tuesday, according to the Wall Street Journal.The combined result sent steel makers, banks and miners soaring. JPMorgan (JPM) led the Dow Jones industrial average with a  nearly 4% gain. Goldman Sachs (GS) jumped 3% and Caterpillar (CAT) climbed nearly 3%.Fiber-optic telecom stocks also outpaced the general market, led by Infinera (INFN) and Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI). Both stocks are not near valid buy points.C.R. Bard (BCR) easily topped the S&P 500, spiking 20% after reporting first-quarter earnings as news broke that the company would be acquired by Becton Dickinson (BDX) in a deal valued at $24 billion. Becton slumped 4%, hurt by a downgrade to credit watch negative, due to financial risk associated with the Bard deal, from Standard & Poor's.Hasbro (HAS) thrashed out a 6% gain following strong first-quarter results, seizing a new high and narrowly topping a 101.18 buy point in a flat base. Shares remained in a buy range.Dell Technologies (DVMT) popped 3% in strong trade, enough to take a new high and clear a flat-base buy point of 65.88.  The IBD Leaderboard and Swing Trader Stock is up 31% since its breakout from a cup-with-handle base in November.Oil and gold both dropped almost 1% during the session, but miners and energy stocks fared reasonably well. Among Nasdaq stocks, Biomarin Pharmaceuticals (BMRN) and Xylinx (XLNX) led, up more than 5% each. Xylinx ended just below a double-bottom base buy point of 60.91.Micron Technology (MU) took the Nasdaq's hardest hit, down a bit less than 3% in strong trade. The memory-chip maker ended 11% below its late-March high and is still holding support at its 10-week moving average.RELATED:Top Stocks In Buy Zone Ahead Of Results: Investing Action PlanThese Three Stocks Break Out As Nasdaq Nears New High

75,XLNX,"Semiconductor stocks are ""in the band of peak valuations,"" making attractive stocks in the sector hard to find, investment bank BMO Capital Markets said Monday.""The list of names we like is small,"" BMO analyst Ambrish Srivastava said in a report.That list includes five chip stocks with outperform ratings: Analog Devices (ADI), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Microsemi (MSCC), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Xilinx (XLNX).He rates graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) as underperform because it has the most downside risk. Srivastava has a price target of 85 on Nvidia.Nvidia was up 3.9% to 99.23 on the stock market today.Meanwhile, RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani expects a ""volatile"" earnings season ahead for chip stocks.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks includes 11 chip industry stocks, including Nvidia, which is ranked No. 3.""The challenge will be, given the material outperformance of semiconductor names, can the valuations continue to hold up?"" Daryanani said in a report Monday.Big factors affecting chip stocks include Apple's (AAPL) upcoming iPhone 8 release and whether PC and server sales will continue to remain strong, he said.Among the chip stocks he covers, Daryanani favors Texas Instruments and Microsemi.RELATED:Apple Supplier Taiwan Semi Revenue Light, Currency Headwinds To PersistApple In-Sourcing Hit List To Spare Cirrus, Skyworks: AnalystApple iPhone Chip Report Hits Dialog, Rattles Supply Chain

76,XLNX,"It's April and Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jen-Hsun Huang is relying on ""Star Wars"" droids R2D2, C3PO and BB8 -- or brightly-colored vehicular versions of them -- to demonstrate his point at Nvidia's GPU Technology Conference in San Jose, Calif. Autonomous driving isn't a ""Jetsons"" trope. It's here.Using Nvidia's Drive PX platform for self-driving cars, BB8 learned over 72 hours and 3,000 miles how to navigate dirt roads, circumvent traffic jams and avoid pedestrians. And BB8 did it all using a graphics-chip-powered supercomputer.This isn't your daddy's GPU.Traditionally, graphics processing units are mostly installed in desktop and laptop computers to handle heavyweight image rendering for gaming, including games used with Facebook's (FB) virtual-reality headset Oculus Rift. But Nvidia isn't about to stop there, says Danny Shapiro, the company's automotive marketing director.""We've taken our GPUs for non-graphics operations: hyperscale computing, scientific discovery, molecular modeling, drug discovery, cancer research,"" Shapiro told IBD. ""Any kind of high-performance computing needs, people are turning to our GPUs to do that. We're filling data centers.""Nvidia counts Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook, IBM (IBM), Microsoft (MSFT) and Twitter (TWTR) among its customers. Its chips, says Huang, already have achieved ""superhuman"" levels of artificial intelligence. The company also partners with Tesla Motors (TSLA) vs. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Ford (F) in the nascent self-driving-car battle.Investors like the road ahead: Nvidia stock touched a record high above 48 on June 20, and it's been in the IBD 50 ranking of top-performing stocks.The GPU opportunity in autonomous vehicles?""It's going to be huge,"" Shapiro said in an interview. ""The reality is, it's really transformative.""In 2019, Baird analyst Tristan Gerra estimates the automotive semiconductor market will reach $28 billion, at a 6% compound annual growth rate, on sensor and radar chips alone. That doesn't include GPU sales -- and while Nvidia doesn't make sensors or radar chips, that gives a clue about the potential size of this market.MKM analyst Ian Ing agrees that the GPU car market will be massive. And Nvidia really is the pole-sitter here.Top GPU rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) -- which declined to comment during its quiet period ahead of its Q2 earnings release on July 21 -- is largely entrenched only in the gaming sector, Ing told IBD. And Intel's (INTC) GPUs are often panned as inferior for desktop gaming, though the No. 1 overall chipmaker also focuses on smartphone and tablet GPUs.The competition among tech and car companies to develop a truly autonomous, mass-marketed vehicle continues to heat up. Apple, Alphabet, Tesla and Ford are among the companies striving for the secret sauce. Regardless of who wins, machine learning is a necessity for autonomous driving, Ing says.""The Google Cars in Mountain View (Calif.), if you program them to exactly follow the rules of the road, they actually cannot drive effectively because they're dealing with all the human drivers,"" Ing said. ""Human drivers won't let them merge into traffic ... or give proper distance.""They need to adjust and adapt, and effectively learn how to get from Point A to Point B.""And that's the goal of Nvidia's autonomous-driving platform, coined as ""Drive PX 2."" It's powered by two systems-on-a-chip (comprised of a GPU and a central processing unit) and two additional bleeding-edge GPUs. That system is the power equivalent of 150 Apple MacBook Pros, says Sean Wix, Nvidia technical market manager.Drive PX 2 runs data compiled by 12 cameras as well as lidar, radar and ultrasonic sensors through what the company calls DaveNet. That's Nvidia's deep neutral network software for autonomous driving. The software has been integrated into the Drive PX 2 platform and trained to operate a car.Nvidia's Shapiro says PX 2, launched in January, outperforms PX 1 by a factor of 10.Shapiro likened DaveNet's training to that of a child. DaveNet builds its ""vocabulary"" through pictures. But pictures, to a computer, are just pixels until logic is applied. The traditional system of computer programming via a series of ""if"" and ""then"" options isn't optimal for driving, he says, because there is just too much randomness in driving.""Deep-learning lets us train the vehicle how to interpret and pick the right action based on teaching it the experiential data,"" he told IBD. And unlike human drivers, ""our cars aren't going to speed, they're not going to text, they're not going to be drunk.""That should cut way down on wrecks, Shapiro says. He estimates 90%, or more, are caused by human error.Nvidia has some competition in the form of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) by Xilinx (XLNX) and Intel (via its Altera acquisition), but MKM's Ing doesn't see the ""smaller design community"" gaining much traction vs. GPUs. Unlike GPUs, which use software to learn, FPGAs are a hardware solution.Still, Xilinx has shipped 100 million devices to automotive and transportation customers, says Baird's Gerra. Xilinx's FPGAs support real-time analytics, video processing and displays, data transport and integration for advanced driver assistance systems.Nvidia supplies GPUs for six of the so-called Super 7 cloud service players -- Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Baidu (BIDU) and Alibaba (BABA) (but not Tencent (TCEHY)). That's a major boon, says MKM's Ing, but it's difficult to completely size the market opportunity.""These deep-learning boxes (for data centers that power cloud systems), you're talking about tens of thousands of dollars of content per box and eight or nine high-performing GPU cards at a couple thousand dollars each, maybe $20,000 to $30,000 per box,"" he said.Initially, Nvidia's artificial intelligence opportunity is in the cloud, Ing says. Beyond that, he expects virtual reality to take a strong foothold in 2017, with autonomous driving following in 2018. Baird's Gerra has a 2018-2022 target for efficient self-driving vehicles.Gaming is really the market where AMD competes with Nvidia, Ing says. AMD's GPU prices have held up better during the recent gaming refresh than Nvidia's, he said in a June 7 research report. Nvidia customers are experiencing shortages after the company's Pascal architecture launch on May 27.Still, gaming remains Nvidia's bread-and-butter segment and will continue to be so amid the artificial intelligence and autonomous driving race, Shapiro told IBD. In Q1, gaming represented more than half of Nvidia's total sales, with data center and automotive at 11% apiece.Although data center and automotive sales accelerated 47% and 62.5%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter, Shapiro sees gaming remaining key for Nvidia.Unlike PCs, gaming is growing, and the VR opportunity is colossal.""Gaming is still a big part of our company, and it still continues to grow despite the fact the PC industry is shrinking, and despite the fact other companies are laying off people in droves,"" Shapiro said. ""Our gaming group is growing.""Nvidia shares fell 5.7% on the stock market today after hitting a record high on Thursday. Apple closed down 2.8%. Alphabet lost 4.15%, setting an 8-month closing low.
"
77,XLNX,"Xilinx (XLNX) stock rocketed near the close Tuesday on a rumored $15 billion takeout offer, but Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri says Apple (AAPL) supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) -- often cited as a potential Xilinx buyer -- would be better off targeting NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).Street Insider first reported the rumor of the offer, citing sources familiar with the matter, but didn't identify the bidder. Xilinx stock shot up 5.7% near the close Tuesday and was up a fraction in after-hours trading.Arcuri retained his outperform rating and 60 price target on Qualcomm stock. Earlier Tuesday, MKM analyst Ian Ing reiterated his view that Broadcom (AVGO) and Qualcomm are potential Xilinx suitors.But Arcuri says Xilinx wouldn't ""move the needle"" for Qualcomm, which may not be completely committed to the data center path. Xilinx's field programmable gate array (FPGA) chips are ideal for data center acceleration, Ing wrote in a research report.""In some ways, Xilinx would clearly accelerate Qualcomm's data center initiatives, but we wouldn't view a Qualcomm/Xilinx deal all that favorably for Qualcomm and would much rather see it buy an asset like NXP,"" Arcuri wrote in a research report. ""This would simply be a huge amount of money to spend for a deal that isn't transformational.""Acquiring NXP would allow Qualcomm to tap into offshore cash, which wouldn't be possible in the case of Xilinx, Arcuri noted. And as Xilinx suits up for a FPGA battle against Intel (INTC), it's planning on spending a lot of dough.""If we were Qualcomm, this factor argues it is better off to wait,"" he wrote.Still, Xilinx is the singular merchant FPGA player following Intel's $16.7 billion acquisition of rival Altera late last year, William Blair analyst Anil Doradla noted earlier Tuesday.The rumored takeout bid follows Xilinx's late Monday analyst day. But Doradla wasn't too impressed, saying the event ""lacked confidence."" Xilinx is focusing on cloud computing, embedded vision, industrial Internet of Things and 5G markets rather than its bread-and-butter wireless and wireline markets.
"
78,XLNX,"Broadly, Xilinx's (XLNX) analyst day Monday was an acknowledgement that the field programmable gate array (FPGA) industry will grow less than 10% in the long term, which could hurt the $16.7 billion bet placed last year by No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) on FPGA-maker Altera, a William Blair analyst said Tuesday.Late Monday, stand-alone FPGA maker Xilinx reiterated its fiscal 2017 guidance for growth of 4%-8% for sales and 7%-9% for operational expenses. Through 2021, Xilinx expects $750 million in incremental opportunity, but that only represents a 6% compound annual growth rate. FPGAs are chips which customers can program ""in the field,"" after manufacture, according to their needs.The overall tone Monday was positive ""but lacked conviction,"" William Blair analyst Anil Doradla wrote Tuesday in a research report. Commentary regarding Xilinx's bread-and-butter wireless and wireline segments was limited, leading Doradla to say demand ""continues to be muted.""""We believe the company is working hard to diversify away from its traditional markets as the company's core markets continue to face structural shifts and increasingly pose headwinds to the company,"" he wrote.Asian product makers are unlikely to pay premium dollars for Xilinx's high-end FPGAs, and the company's aerospace and defense spending opportunities are highly exposed to volatile government funding, Doradla wrote. But he kept his outperform rating on Xilinx stock.Xilinx's commentary Monday centered on growth opportunities within cloud computing, embedded vision, industrial Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G markets. There, Xilinx faces FPGA competition from Intel/Altera and an IoT rivalry with Nvidia (NVDA) graphics chips.On the stock market today, Xilinx stock surged 5.7%, to 47.45. Shares have climbed incrementally on seven of the past eight trading days. But Tuesday's rise underperformed IBD's 41-company Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry group, which ended the day up more than 3% Tuesday. Intel stock was up 2.8%, to 31.06.Xilinx's fiscal 2017 investments could lead to greater market share gains against Intel/Altera, Rosenblatt analyst Kinngai Chan wrote in a report. Xilinx sees its 28-nanometer and 20-nm market share at 65% and 80%, respectively. And Xilinx forecasts a one-year lead on Altera in the 16-nm market. This refers to the width of the circuitry etching in chips, so the smaller the manufacturing capability, the more electronics that in theory can go onto a chip.The investments should lead to ""robust"" growth for patient investors in 2021, MKM analyst Ian Ing says. The competitive landscape vs. Intel looks ""benign,"" and Xilinx's uniquely re-configurable chips are ideal for data center acceleration, he wrote in a report.But ""we do not foresee Xilinx's investment time frames shortening from the four-five years from initial investments to material revenues,"" he wrote. ""Specialty FPGA chips are unique, given that they must go through two complete design and development cycles before volume.""That could drive off potential investors, he wrote, reiterating his belief that Xilinx could benefit from an acquisition by Apple (AAPL) suppliers such as Qualcomm (QCOM) or Broadcom (AVGO). William Blair's Doradla noted as much -- Xilinx remains the singular merchant player in the FPGA market, he said.Ing kept his neutral rating and 45 price target on Xilinx stock.
"
79,XLNX,"Apple (AAPL) supplier Broadcom (AVGO) might begin ""pooling capital"" for acquisitions over the next six months to a year, Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore said Monday in a research report following up on the No. 2 fabless chipmaker's Q2 earnings last week.Seymore boosted his price target on Broadcom stock to 200 from 180 and reiterated a buy rating. On Thursday, Broadcom topped analysts' Q2 views, as growth in wired infrastructure sales offset weak Apple iPhone sales.Broadcom stock closed up 0.2% on the stock market today. Shares hit an all-time high of 166 on Friday, up more than 10% for the year. Broadcom stock is now in a buy zone after forming a nearly eight-week cup on Thursday and breaking out from a 159.75 buy point on Friday. It's an IBD Leaderboard stock.Broadcom has executed ""superbly,"" Seymore wrote in his research report.""Broadcom was impacted by weakness at Apple and in HDD (hard disk drives), but this was more than offset by strength in wired, highlighting the diversity of Broadcom's multiple growth drives,"" he wrote.In Q3, Seymore is looking for 25% quarter-over-quarter growth in Broadcom's wireless segment, as Apple begins to ramp up its iPhone 7 in preparation for an expected September release. The wired business should post slight sequential growth, offset by enterprise storage and industrial declines.Broadcom is also quickly deleveraging following its merger with the former Avago earlier this year. In Q1, the former Avago bought Broadcom for $37 billion, keeping the Broadcom name and Avago stock ticker.During fiscal  Q2, Broadcom sold its wireless infrastructure unit to MaxLinear (MXL) and its Internet of Things segment to Cypress Semiconductor (CY). In the long term, Broadcom says, it will begin ""pooling capital in anticipation of future M&A"" when it reaches two times debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization).Seymore sees that happening in the second half of 2016 or the first half of 2017. Broadcom and Qualcomm (QCOM) have been bounced around as potential bidders for Xilinx (XLNX). Cavium (CAVM) and Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) are also often placed on the theoretical sales table.Seymore raised his view for Q3 earnings per share minus items to $2.78 from $2.58. For 2016 and 2017, he models $11.52 and $13, respectively.

80,XLNX,"Apple's (AAPL) lukewarm iPhone 7 ramp may slug Analog Devices (ADI) early Wednesday, when the chipmaker is expected to report a 5% year-over-year revenue dip on a 40% sequential plunge in sales to Apple.But a ""bright spot"" of industrial and automotive sales will show a seasonal boost, outplaying rival Xilinx (XLNX), and wireless communication revenue will come off a trough to top competitors Nokia (NOK) and Cavium (CAVM), MKM analyst Ian Ing said Tuesday.In morning trading on the stock market today, Analog Devices stock was up a fraction, near 55.50. Shares are flat for the year vs. a 6% fall in IBD's 38-company Electronic Semiconductor-Manufacturing industry group.Analog Devices stock hit a 2016 high on April 27 at 59.87, but it's down 7% in the three weeks since then. In late April, Apple reported its first-ever year-over-year decline in iPhone shipments, in its March-quarter results.Analog Devices is expected to post $777.6 million in sales and 62 cents earnings per share ex items, down a respective 5% and 15% vs. the year-earlier quarter, for its fiscal Q2 ended on or near April 30, according to the consensus of 29 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.That would follow flat Q1 sales and Analog Devices' first EPS decline in 11 quarters. Wall Street expects typically strong Q3 and Q4 sales to also decline -- by 2% and 6%, respectively. Over the past two years, Q3 had risen an average 13.5%, and Q4 sales had gained an average 20%.Recent reports indicate Apple suppliers are getting fewer orders compared with the year-ago period.Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer expects Analog Devices to report $30 million in Q2 sales to Apple, down 40% sequentially. For Q3, he models $80 million in sales to Apple vs. consensus views for $110 million.""We suspect modest downside to our Apple revenue estimate for (the second half of the year) offset by upside to (industrial, automotive and communications),"" he wrote in a research report.Apple accounts for about 10% of Analog Devices' sales, Pitzer estimated. Views for $200 million in Apple sales for the latter half of 2016 would be down 15% year over year, but they still ""might be $20 million to $30 million too high,"" he said.But $1.33 billion views for automotive, industrial and communications sales, up 2% vs. the year-earlier period, doesn't reflect accelerating advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and communications infrastructure opportunities, he wrote.Pitzer retained his outperform rating and 72 price target on Analog Devices stock. Ing kept his neutral rating and 56 price target.Analog Devices' messaging has tilted in favor of ""analog utility"" investors vs. momentum growth investors, Ing wrote in a report. Analog utility investors prefer business-to-business ventures over ""volatile"" portables exposure.

81,XLNX,"With its planned purchase of Mobileye (MBLY), Intel (INTC) aims to become a one-stop shop for automated driving systems for carmakers.Hoping its self-driving technology will have the same impact as its ""Intel Inside"" efforts for personal computers, the chipmaking giant says it will combine its expertise in high-performance computing and connectivity with Mobileye's expertise in computer-vision technology for advanced driver assistance systems.Intel estimates the vehicle systems, data and services market opportunity to be worth up to $70 billion by 2030.""Together we expect to be the global leader in autonomous driving,"" Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said on a conference call with analysts. ""We believe this combination will accelerate auto industry innovation by delivering world-class edge-to-edge solutions at a much lower cost, faster time to market and complete single solutions that our customers are asking for.""Intel announced early Monday that it intends to buy Israel-based Mobileye for $15.3 billion. It expects the deal to close within nine months, pending shareholder and regulatory approvals. It said the deal will be immediately accretive to its non-GAAP earnings and free cash flow.The company agreed to pay $63.54 a share in cash for Mobileye, which is a 34% premium to Mobileye's closing price on Friday. Mobileye stock shot up 28% to close at 60.62 on the stock market today. Intel dropped 2.1% to 35.16.IBD'S TAKE: Intel stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 70, meaning it has outperformed 70% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months.

For more information on Intel and its peers, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Intel plans to locate its automated driving group in Israel. The group will be led by Amnon Shashua, Mobileye's co-founder, chairman and chief technology officer.Wall Street analysts were lukewarm to negative on Intel's Mobileye acquisition.""Intel is seeking relevance in automotive with the Mobileye acquisition in a market that is moving at a faster-than-expected pace,"" Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann said in a report. ""The acquisition is in line with the Altera acquisition in that it is defensive in nature and meant to defend Intel's historical CPU (central processing unit) incumbency from various accelerator technologies.""Intel and Mobileye trail Nvidia (NVDA) and Xilinx (XLNX) in the autonomous driving market, Mosesmann said.He rates Intel stock as sell, Nvidia as buy and Xilinx as neutral.Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri also described the Intel acquisition as ""defensive.""""While this deal makes strategic sense, the action is consistent with a defensive posture in which Intel continues to throw huge amounts of capital (Altera, Mobileye, 3DXP memory) at defending its moat and selling more Xeons,"" he said in a report.Arcuri rates Intel stock as market perform with a price target of 39.Jefferies downgraded Intel to hold from buy on news of the acquisition. It cut its price target to 36 from 45.Semiconductor Advisors called the acquisition ""a small incremental net negative"" for Intel, given the focus outside of core semiconductors and amount of money spent vs. near-term revenue and profit.RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani reiterated his sector perform rating and price target of 37 for Intel after the acquisition news.Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry, a longtime bear on Mobileye stock, panned the deal.""Basically, Intel has now inherited Mobileye's problems, and we don't think Intel has the capacity to fix Mobileye's issues,"" he said in a note.

To see which stocks lead the group, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Seattle-based Impinj earned 11 cents a share excluding items, up 57% year over year, on sales of $33.7 million, up 49%, in the December quarter. Analysts expected 9 cents and $32.4 million.For the current quarter, Impinj expects to lose 3 cents a share on sales of $30.75 million, at the midpoint of its guidance. Wall Street was modeling Impinj to earn 2 cents a share ex items on sales of $29.3 million.Ricchiuti says the Impinj guidance for Q2 could be conservative.Impinj provides radio-frequency identification (RFID) products for wirelessly tracking and managing items in retail, pharmaceutical, health care, manufacturing and other industries. Its RAIN RFID systems are used for identifying, locating and authenticating items in the supply chain.""The core retail business continues to represent a significant growth opportunity, in our view, with RAIN RFID having penetrated only 10% of the specialty apparel market,"" Ricchiuti said in a report. ""Impinj is gaining momentum in key verticals like health care, transportation and logistics, where new use cases support the broad platform-based solutions Impinj can deliver to the market.""Impinj went public last July at 14 and reached an all-time high of 41.91 on Dec. 22.Mizuho Securities on Thursday initiated coverage of chip designer Xilinx (XLNX) at neutral with a price target of 64. Xilinx stock slipped 0.55% to 59.35 Thursday.Xilinx is a leader in the market for field-programmable gate arrays with more than 50% share. Intel (INTC) is No. 2 with 27% market share, Mizuho said.""Xilinx serves a proprietary, high-margin market in communication, industrial, automotive and deep learning,"" Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh said in a report. ""With communication, industrial and aerospace about 83% of  revenue  plus  potential  AI  tail winds  offset  by  overall  slow  top-line growth, we see the stock as fairly valued.""Xilinx also could potentially be an acquisition target, Rakesh said.""With positions in the automotive, communication, and AI markets, we believe Xilinx could be an attractive target as has been noted multiple times in the press and by us, with strong free cash flow and gross margins,"" Rakesh said.RELATED:Broadcom Spikes To Record High After Beat-And-Raise Q1

85,XLNX,"Broadcom (AVGO) CEO Hock Tan hinted Thursday at Apple's (AAPL) ""imminent"" recovery, thanks to its iPhone 7 ramp, MKM analyst Ing Ing said Friday after Tan guided to 20% sequential wireless growth in the July quarter and increased content in the 7 vs. the iPhone 6S.Sales of Apple's iPhone 6S have largely disappointed. In April, Apple reported its first year-over-year decline in iPhone sales. The July quarter will be ""a very different picture,"" Tan told analysts Thursday during the company's Q2 earnings conference call.A ""large North American customer"" -- widely assumed to be Apple -- is ramping up its next flagship smartphone with a ""substantial"" increase in Broadcom content, Tan said on the call. That will likely increase again in October, he said.IBD Take: Broadcom ranks No. 7 in its big group. Find out why at IBD Stock Checkup.""A strong Apple smartphone cycle appears imminent,"" Ing wrote in a research report Friday as he boosted his price target on Broadcom stock to 188 from 162. Ing reiterated his buy rating on Broadcom stock.Ing was one of at least 16 analysts Friday to boost their price targets on Broadcom stock following the company's fiscal Q2 earnings report late Thursday. Broadcom stock gapped up to a record high of 166 early on the stock market today, and shares were up nearly 5%, to 162.56 at the close.Radio-frequency competitors Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) stocks also lifted early Friday, though Qorvo was down a fraction in morning trading. Broadcom's fiscal Q3 guidance topped the consensus, and it posted a hefty 15-cent Q2 earnings beat on better-than-expected post-Avago merger synergies.Late Thursday, Broadcom reported $792 million in wireless sales, up 38% vs. the year-earlier quarter but missing guidance for $820 million. Wired infrastructure sales soared 440% to $2.06 billion. Enterprise storage and industrial sales came in at $525 million and $182 million, up 12% and down 17%, respectively. Broadcom's Tomahawk switches drove blowout wired revenue, Craig-Hallum analyst Anthony Stoss said Friday.Stoss maintained his buy rating and 200 price target on Broadcom stock, and he sees Broadcom growing its iPhone 7 content by 30% vs. the iPhone 6S, potentially offsetting the possibility of another dip in iPhone unit shipments.Investors are missing the runway on RF chipmakers, Stoss wrote in a research report.""We expect at least several more years of additional content gains due to more bands, carrier aggregation and additional RF filters,"" he wrote. ""We believe the expected launch of 5G in 2020 will only add to the content gains and RF flexibility.""He also expects Broadcom's appetite for M&A might be growing. Broadcom paid off $565 million of debt in Q2 and expects to pay $1 billion in Q3 with cash from divestitures, such as the sale of its Internet of Things unit to Cypress Semiconductor (CY).Analysts have posited Broadcom could make a play for small chipmaker Xilinx (XLNX). Fellow Apple supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) has also been thrown into the hypothetical Xilinx bidder mix. In 2015, chip sector M&A topped $115 billion.""We believe Broadcom will be in a position to make an additional acquisition or two by the end of this calendar year,"" Stoss wrote. ""Broadcom has demonstrated the ability to extract substantial value and reap the benefits of scale through accretive acquisitions.""

86,XLNX,"Apple (AAPL) iPhone supplier Broadcom (AVGO) is quickly deleveraging and might pursue M&A before year's end, MKM analyst Ian Ing said Friday, days after Broadcom's name was again thrown into the theoretical bidder hat for Xilinx (XLNX).Xilinx stock rose by 5.7% Tuesday on rumors that it had received a $15 billion bid from an unidentified source. Apple suppliers Qualcomm (QCOM) and Broadcom are often rumored suitors, but Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri sees NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) as a better target for Qualcomm.""The Broadcom story largely revolves around a quick deleverage and return to semiconductor consolidation via accretive deals, possibly by calendar year 2016 exit,"" Ing wrote Friday in a research report.Recently, Broadcom tucked-in 5G modulation firm MagnaCom, in a $50 million acquisition. It also sold its Internet of Things unit to Cypress Semiconductor (CY) to ""help reduce debt and monetize"" its discontinued operations, Ing wrote.After the market close Thursday, Broadcom is slated to report its first quarterly earnings results following its January merger with Avago. The former Avago bought classic Broadcom for $37 billion, keeping the Broadcom name and AVGO stock ticker.For its fiscal Q2 ended on or near April 30, Broadcom is expected to report $3.55 billion in sales and $2.38 earnings per share ex items, up a respective 116% and 12% vs. the year-earlier quarter. EPS will slightly accelerate from 8% growth in the prior quarter but won't hit December 2015 levels.Long term, Broadcom and other chips combos are at risk of Apple's penchant for sourcing from suppliers ""that have an easier path to full integration,"" Ing wrote. Broadcom is about 14% exposed to Apple, providing some $4-$5 of content per iPhone.""Apple's second-sourcing of modem chips via Intel (INTC) may be an interim step toward full integration centered around the (Apple) Ax-series applications processor,"" Ing wrote. Intel is more open to implementing third-party apps processor IP than is Qualcomm, he says.""An Apple single-chip integration comparable to Qualcomm's Snapdragon would save package, test and assembly costs as well as power consumption,"" Ing wrote.It wouldn't be the first time that Apple has used dual component suppliers. The iPhone 6S contained A9 processors from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and Samsung.Samsung reportedly yielded to Taiwan Semi for the iPhone 7 processor.Broadcom stock rose a fraction Friday, to 153.30, and IBD's 41-company Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless industry group also rose a fraction. Broadcom stock is up 5% for the year vs. a 2% climb for the group.Broadcom stock is working on a cup-type base, with a possible buy point of 159.75.

87,XLNX,"Apple (AAPL) suppliers Broadcom (AVGO) and Qualcomm (QCOM) were pitted Tuesday in a theoretical battle to acquire Xilinx (XLNX) which, late Wednesday, is expected to report flat fiscal fourth-quarter sales along with down earnings.Xilinx stock was up 1.3% to 46.38 on the stock market today. It split the difference between gains by fellow takeover candidates Cavium (CAVM) and Marvell Technology Group (MRVL), up 3.4% and 0.75%, respectively.MKM analyst Ian Ing lists the trio among small- and medium-size fabless firms subject to acquisition as semiconductor companies scramble to serve the top 20 customers: Apple, Samsung, Cisco Systems (CSCO), Nokia (NOK), Ericsson (ERIC) and China's Huawei, among others.""Customers prefer the fewest suppliers while preserving multi-sourcing choice,"" Ing wrote in a research report. ""Fabless companies can improve their operating models with more scale in manufacturing and operations.""Field-programmable gate array (FPGA) makers are proving attractive targets. In December, Intel (INTC) completed its acquisition of Altera, an FPGA-maker. For Broadcom, the technology would round out its networking and communications equipment needs.Qualcomm needs to diversify from its core mobile business which is threatened by chipsets and disagreements with licensees in China, Ing wrote.Ing expects Xilinx to tack on $3 earnings per share to 2017 run rates, ""should a large acquirer apply scale benefits."" He rates Xilinx stock a neutral and has a 46 price target, noting it's coming off a 2015 data center and communications trough.For Q4, which ended in December, Xilinx is expected to report flat sales of $566.2 million and adjusted earnings per share of 52 cents, down 10% year over year. For fiscal 2016, the consensus of 21 analysts models $2.2 billion and $2.03, down a respective 7% and 16.5%.

88,XLNX,"Veteran semiconductor securities analyst Hans Mosesmann, who joined Rosenblatt Securities this month, initiated coverage on a range of chip stocks Wednesday. He slapped Intel (INTC) with a sell rating and gave buy ratings to three stocks on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks.The IBD 50 currently lists 10 chip industry stocks, including Broadcom (AVGO), Microchip Technology (MCHP) and Nvidia (NVDA), all of which Mosesmann recommends.""We are initiating coverage of the semiconductor sector today with a positive bias in an industry that is seeing moderating growth (mid-single digits), continued consolidation, and a slowing of Moore's Law,"" Mosesmann said in his research report.Key disruptive themes to watch include artificial intelligence (machine learning, deep learning and self-driving cars), cloud computing and data center growth, the emergence of compute-centric graphics processing units, and multiple bandwidth transitions including optical, he said.IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia stock has a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99 and is ranked No. 1 on the IBD 50 list of superior growth stocks.In computing, Mosesmann favors the prospects of Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) as the top GPU players in the market. Nvidia's investments in artificial intelligence and parallel computing give it an edge in markets like autonomous driving, he said. AMD has the opportunity to gain market share in x86 servers with its Zen processor portfolio, he said.He rates both stocks as buy with price targets of 140 for Nvidia and 16.50 for AMD.Nvidia stock slipped a fraction to 110.76 on the stock market today. But AMD stock rose 2% to 14.28, hitting its highest price since October 2007.Mosesmann said he is ""skeptical"" about Intel's prospects in computing, hence the sell rating. Intel fell 1.2% to 36.07 Wednesday.He rates Broadcom, Microchip and Texas Instruments (TXN) as buy because they are diversified, free-cash-flow-focused companies. He set price targets of 250 on Broadcom, 90 on Microchip and Texas Instruments.Broadcom stock rose 0.66% to 214.16, hitting an all-time high for the third straight trading day. Microchip rose 0.77% to 73.04. TI stock rose 15 cents to 77.23.He also set buy ratings on memory chipmaker Micron Technology (MU) and optical components firm Inphi (IPHI). He gave price targets of 34 to Micron and 60 on Inphi.Micron stock slipped 2 cents to 23.75 Wednesday, while Inphi fell 0.72% to 51.03.Mosesmann rates as neutral Cavium (CAVM), Mellanox Technologies (MLNX) and Xilinx (XLNX) based on valuation.RELATED:Chip Sector Remains Strong As Recent Earnings Impress

89,XLNX,"Mobile chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) was slapped with at least seven price-target cuts on Thursday, a day after reporting mixed December-quarter results. Meanwhile, chip gear maker Lam Research (LRCX) received at least six price-target hikes after delivering better-than-expected results for the December quarter.Qualcomm late Wednesday reported fiscal first-quarter results that missed views on sales but beat on earnings per share by a penny. It also gave guidance that was in line with Wall Street's targets for the March quarter.BMO Capital Markets, CFRA Research, Cowen, Pacific Crest Securities, RBC Capital Markets, Stifel and Susquehanna Financial Group all lowered their target prices on Qualcomm stock.Many analysts cited uncertainty for Qualcomm surrounding a pending antitrust complaint by the Federal Trade Commission and lawsuits by Apple (AAPL) over its patent licensing practices.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks includes nine chip industry companies, including Nvidia and Applied Materials.San Diego-based Qualcomm earned $1.19 a share excluding items, up 23% year over year, on sales of $5.99 billion, up 4%, in fiscal Q1 ended Dec. 25. Analysts expected Qualcomm to earn $1.18 a share ex items on sales of $6.12 billion.For the current quarter, Qualcomm expects to earn $1.20 a share ex items, up 15%, on sales of $5.9 billion, up 5%, based on the midpoint of its guidance.Investor focus on the FTC case and Apple lawsuits could remain an overhang on Qualcomm's stock, UBS analyst Stephen Chin said in his research report. He rates Qualcomm as neutral with a price target of 58.Qualcomm stock was down 5% to 54.05 on the stock market today.Lam Research earned $2.24 a share excluding items, up 43%, on sales of $1.88 billion, up 32%, in its fiscal second-quarter ended Dec. 25. Analysts were looking for $2.19 in EPS and $1.84 billion in sales.Fremont, Calif.-based Lam Research late Wednesday also gave bullish guidance for the current quarter.Cowen, Needham, Pacific Crest, RBC Capital Markets, Susquehanna Financial Group and UBS all hiked their price targets for the stock.But Lam stock was down 2.2% to 114.33 Thursday.""Lam continues to demonstrate high demand for its products,"" Pacific Crest analyst Weston Twigg said in a report. ""After posting a record shipment quarter in December, Lam expects another big record in March and roughly flat shipments in June.""There is some investor concern that March will be the peak quarter for Lam shipments, Chin said. But the UBS analyst believes Lam could see shipment growth in fiscal 2018, thanks to strong demand from Chinese firms.Fabless chipmaker Xilinx (XLNX) earned price-target hikes from Jefferies and Pacific Crest after posting better-than-forecast December quarter results late Wednesday.San Jose, Calif.-based Xilinx earned 52 cents a share, up 6%, on sales of $586 million, up 3%, in its fiscal third quarter ended Dec. 31.Analysts were modeling for Xilinx to earn 49 cents a share on sales of $580 million.""Strong execution continues"" at Xilinx, BMO analyst Ambrish Srivastava said in a report. ""We continue to view Xilinx as a fairly unique investment in our coverage, given its position as the only independent FPGA (field-programmable gate array) company, with an unprecedented multinode advantage.""Additionally, Xilinx is beginning to demonstrate success in the emerging data-center opportunity via wins at Baidu (BIDU) and Amazon (AMZN).""He rates Xilinx as outperform with a price target of 66.Xilinx gave March-quarter guidance that was slightly below consensus on sales and implied EPS in line with views.Xilinx stock was down 3.7% to 57.37 Thursday.

AMD stock jumped to a nearly six-year high of 9.45 on Tuesday amid more rumors of a licensing deal with longtime archrival Intel (INTC) and after the chipmaker extended a partnership with chip-design software maker Mentor Graphics (MENT). The company also is preparing to preview its new Zen central processing unit on Dec. 13.AMD rose 2.9% to 10.86 in the stock market today.The maker of programmable chips for telecom, industrial, aerospace, defense, consumer, automotive and other markets was upgraded to outperform from market perform at Morgan Stanley, which raised its price target of 60 from 50.Shares jumped 6.1% to 60.18.The oil giant was upgraded to outperform from neutral at Macquarie. Crude prices ended sharply lower Wednesday after the Federal Reserve's rate increase sent the dollar higher, worsening the sell-off prompted by new indications of a persistent glut in oil inventories. But OPEC's deal with nonmembers to trim production sparked an earlier rally in prices.Chevron climbed 0.9% to 117.05.Coverage was initiated on the carrier by Barclays with an equal weight rating and price target of 62. American Airline last Friday said it could see a possible increase in unit revenue in Q4. The outlook would make American the first U.S. network carrier to push the key metric into positive territory after two years of expansion, fare cuts and a stronger dollar dragged it lower.American Airlines ascended 0.8% to 48.30.Barclays also initiated coverage on the discount carrier with an equal weight rating and price target of 65.  Southwest and United Airlines (UAL) and Southwest offered upbeat views last week on ticket demand for the holiday season, while an industry group said profitability will drop next year from this year's projected record high.Southwest Airlines surged 2.7% to 50.59, now beyond buy range from a recent breakout at 48.10.

93,XLNX,"Stocks tumbled in and out of mixed trade Thursday morning as earning reports, economic news and overseas factors all had a say in early action.The Nasdaq held up a 0.2% gain, buoyed primarily by Facebook (FB). The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 0.4% and the S&P 500 dipped 0.2%.Volume rose mildly, up 1% on the NYSE and 8% higher on the Nasdaq, vs. action at the same time Wednesday.The stock market today felt early pressure from overseas markets, which traded generally lower after the Bank of Japan held its monetary policy unchanged and sent the yen soaring and Tokyo's Nikkei 225 to a 3.6% loss Thursday. Economic news increased that weight, after the Labor Department estimated Q1 GDP growth at 0.5%, sharply below Q4 growth and below the consensus view for 0.7%.Nearly all Dow stocks declined at the open. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) led the few advancing issues, up 0.9%. DuPont (DD) shouldered the heaviest loss, down more than 2%, possibly affected by investor response to Q1 results from its pending merger mate Dow Chemical (DOW). Dow's results topped expectations, but the economic outlook appeared wobbly. Dow shares slipped 2%.Facebook easily led the Nasdaq 100 with a 10% advance.

94,XLNX,"Robot bartenders, a drone racetrack and liquid nitrogen-concocted food? Silicon Valley geeks know how to get down -- and that's just after-hours.Next week, graphics-chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) is slated to host its annual GPU Technology Conference at the San Jose McEnery Conference Center where virtual reality, artificial intelligence and self-driving cars will take center stage.In conjunction, Nvidia will hold its analyst day Tuesday, when CEO Jen-Hsun Huang is scheduled to deliver a keynote talk. RBC Capital analyst Mitch Steves expects Nvidia to offer an update on its Pascal GPU architecture, virtual-reality offerings and automotive efforts.Steves upped his price target to 36 from 32 on Nvidia stock, which he rates a sector perform.""Overall, we are positive on the VR opportunity and believe that growth rates will remain robust,"" he wrote in a research report.Virtual reality is getting a big splash this year, and tech names Apple (AAPL), IBM (IBM), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla Motors (TSLA) are on deck to attend the GTC alongside myriad startups like BriSky, a maker of industrial drones, and Lucid, which makes 3D cameras.Under the GTC umbrella, BriSky, Lucid and 10 others will compete Wednesday for $100,000 during the Emerging Companies Summit. Another eight are slated to present their VR tech in an eight-minute elevator pitch for a chance at $15,000.There's no denying the summit's success, which helped launch VR headset-maker Oculus and video game-streaming service Gaikai into worldwide recognition. Facebook (FB) later acquired Oculus for $2 billion, and Sony (SNE) paid $380 million for Gaikai.Mellanox Technology (MLNX) and Xilinx (XLNX) will present during the OpenPower Summit, Tuesday through Friday.

95,XLNX,"A new U.S. export ban against Chinese mobile gear maker ZTE related to its under-the-table sales to Iran could hurt Apple (AAPL) chip suppliers Qualcomm (QCOM), Qorvo (QRVO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), a Pacific Crest analyst wrote Wednesday.Regulators imposed the sanctions Tuesday, alleging that ZTE used four shell companies in China and Iran to ""illicitly re-export controlled items to Iran in violation of U.S. export control laws."" The ban prohibits U.S. companies from selling to ZTE.Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi opposed the sanctions, saying that ZTE's tech purchases support thousands of U.S. jobs, according to the AP. Chipmakers Cavium (CAVM), Integrated Device Technology (IDTI), Silicon Laboratories (SLAB) and Xilinx (XLNX) also sell to ZTE.""This approach will only hurt others without necessarily benefiting oneself,"" Yi said at a new conference Tuesday.ZTE isn't banned from selling products in the U.S. but cannot procure components from U.S. companies. U.S. firms can apply for an export license, but Pacific Crest analyst John Vinh sees the government unlikely to grant them.The development could shuffle the smartphone market. ZTE owns about 4% of the global smartphone market, Vinh wrote. Industry tracker IDC says that ZTE competes alongside Xiaomi and Huawei in the low-end to midrange smartphone market, vs. No. 1 smartphone vendor Samsung.Vinh expects short-term effects on chipmakers to be ""negligible."" Longer term, he says that ZTE could lose share to Huawei, Ericsson (ERIC), Alcatel-Lucent (ALU), Nokia (NOK), Siemens (SIEGY), Xiaomi, Oppo and Lenovo.""Alternatively, ZTE could conform to the U.S. embargo list, which could result in sanctions being lifted,"" he wrote.Xilinx is most at risk, with 3%-3.5% of total revenue stemming from sales to ZTE, Vinh estimates. Silicon Labs follows with 2%-2.5% of total revenue wrapped in ZTE sales.IDT, Qualcomm and Qorvo are each 2% tied to ZTE, Cavium 1%-2%, and about 1.5% of Skyworks' sales stem from the Chinese smartphone maker.Wall Street largely yawned Wednesday, however. Midday on the stock market today, only Qualcomm stock was down, dipping a fraction. Cavium stock was up a fraction. Shares of Qorvo, Silicon Labs, Skyworks and Xilinx were all up more than 1%. Integrated Device Technology stock was up more than 2.5%.

96,XLNX,"With its soaring growth, Facebook (FB) may soon take steps to ease its tax burden, according to a Morgan Stanley report.And, Morgan Stanley says, Facebook is one of a list of technology and pharmaceutical companies that could gain if Congress creates a “patent box” as part of corporate tax reform.Other companies that would benefit from a patent box, also called an ""innovation box,"" would be Qualcomm (QCOM), chip maker Xilinx (XLNX), as well as drug companies Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), says the report.A patent box provides lower tax rates on royalty income generated from licensing. Intellectual property can include patents, trademarks, designs and logos.On Qualcomm, Morgan Stanley noted: “The IP licensing business is conducted almost entirely in the United States, and as such, we believe it generally pays near full corporate taxes.”Shares in Facebook jumped 16% by early afternoon in the stock market today, after the social networking giant late Wednesday said Q4 revenue jumped 52% from a year earlier to $5.84 billion.“In 2015, we estimate that around 51% of Facebook’s revenue will be generated internationally. Despite this fact, we estimate that Facebook will have (an approximate) 34% adjusted tax rate in 2015 (very close to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%). Going forward, Facebook may take steps to reduce its tax burden,” the Morgan Stanley report said.Congress could pass legislation overhauling corporate taxes, it said.Senators Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y) and Rob Portman (R-OH) have proposed tax reform aimed at “tax inversion” deals, in which companies relocate headquarters to a lower-tax nation, usually following an acquisition.“A patent or innovation box might be the United States' best means to combat inversions and remain competitive with other countries,” said the Morgan Stanley report.Supporters say a patent box would also help keep research and development in the U.S.

Small caps outperformed as the Russell 2000 advanced 0.7%.The session left the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 heading into Friday on positive footing for the week. The Russell 2000 enters Friday's session toting a loss so far this week of 1.7%. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in lower than Wednesday; Nasdaq volume was slightly higher.Positive manufacturing data fueled the indexes to early gains as the stock market continued to digest the Federal Reserve's interest-rate hike announced Wednesday. Homebuilder confidence also offered support, with the National Association of Home Builders' Housing Market Index spiked to its highest level since 2005.Goldman Sachs (GS) led the Dow with a 1.6% gain. Nike (NKE) lagged with a 1.2% drop.Hospitals, medical software makers and shipping fleets posted some of the best gains on the stock market today, while gold miners, toy makers and apparel companies suffered some of the worst hits.AthenaHealth (ATHN) spiked 22% after raising its 2017 revenue and operating income outlook to above consensus views after Wednesday's close.  The stock is still below its 40-week moving average, attempting to climb off the bottom of a yearlong consolidation.IBD 50 stock InterDigital (IDCC) pared an early 16% advance to 8%. The wireless-modem and circuit-board maker raised its fourth-quarter revenue guidance to more than double that of consensus estimates. The stock is extended and tracing new highs after a Dec. 2 rebound from support at its 10-week moving average.IBD 50 peers SVB Financial (SIVB), Macom Technology Solution Holdings (MTSI) and Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) all rose more than 3%.  All are extended beyond buy points.Xilinx (XLNX) led the Nasdaq 100, gapping up to a 6% gain in huge volume. Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to overweight from equal weight. The gain left the stock 11% above a 54.39 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.After the close, Adobe Networks (ADBE) and Oracle (ORCL) reported quarterly numbers.Oracle fell nearly 3% in extended trading after reporting mixed fiscal Q2 results. The database software maker earned 61 cents a share ex items, down 3% from the prior year and a penny above views. Non-GAAP revenue climbed 1% to $9.07 billion, below forecasts for $9.14 billion. Oracle didn't provide a forward outlook.Adobe was fractionally higher after topping fiscal Q4 estimates with EPS of 90 cents, up 45% year over year, on a 23% rise in sales to $1.61 billion. It expects non-GAAP EPS of 87 cents on $1.625 billion in sales for fiscal Q1. Consensus forecasts are for EPS of 85 cents ex items on $1.65 billion in revenue.RELATED: Factory Growth Jumps, Builder Sentiment Soars As Trump Fuels Animal SpiritsOracle Tops On Earnings, Misses On RevenueAdobe Systems Beats Sales, Earnings Targets For Q4

98,XLNX,"Graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) received a buy rating from Evercore ISI on Wednesday amid a flurry of rating and price-target changes for semiconductor stocks on Wall Street.Evercore analyst C.J. Muse upgraded Nvidia stock to buy from hold and set a price target of 120, up from 87. Nvidia stock jumped 5.8% to 96.45 on the stock market today, though the overall market slumped late after the Fed raised interest rates, as expected, and indicated more hikes would happen in 2017. Nvidia stock hit an all-time high of 96.62 on Dec. 8 and has nearly tripled this year.Nvidia, a member of the IBD 50, has been on a tear since Nov. 11 after it reported fiscal Q3 sales and earnings that crushed estimates and guided higher for the current quarter.Best known for making graphics processors for PCs and video game consoles, Nvidia has branched into new markets like data centers and auto infotainment systems. It also is developing processors for self-driving cars and artificial intelligence.IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia stock has a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99 and is ranked No. 1 on the IBD 50 list of top growth stocks.The machine learning wave is in the early stages and is using more and more Nvidia graphics processors, Muse said in a research note.Muse on Wednesday also initiated coverage of Xilinx (XLNX) with a buy rating. He set a price target of 70. Xilinx makes programmable chips for telecom, industrial, aerospace, defense, consumer, automotive and other markets.Xilinx stock rose 0.44% to 56.73 Wednesday. Its shares are trading at a more than 15-year high, in a buy zone from a 54.39 buy point touched Nov. 30.Meanwhile, Needham upgraded shares of semiconductor equipment maker KLA-Tencor (KLAC) to strong buy from buy and raised its price target to 95 from 86.KLA-Tencor stock fell a fraction to 77.81. It is in buy range from a 77.95 buy point.JPMorgan, however, downgraded Qualcomm (QCOM) to neutral from overweight, with a price target of 70.Qualcomm fell 2.6% Wednesday to 67.56. Despite the setback, the stock is building a cup-shaped base.Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland reiterated his positive rating on Microsemi (MSCC) and raised his price target to 70 from 55. Microsemi fell 0.89% to 54.70. It is extended from a 39.26 entry.RELATED:Broadcom, TI Enter Buy Zones As Intel, Qualcomm Approach Theirs

102,XLNX,"Investors showed less cheer amid a broad decline, but most of the major indexes shaved losses by Thursday's close. Volume grew on both main exchanges, according to preliminary data.Retailers paced the decline on a negative report from the influential market research firm NPD that pointed to lower retail sales during the holiday season vs. the same time a year ago. News that President-elect Donald Trump is mulling a sizable tariff on imports certainly did not dampen concerns.Department store chain, discount and variety store chain, home furnishings, apparel and shoes and specialty retail groups all slid more than 3% for the day. Auto retailing, leisure products and jewelry stocks also got battered.Meanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) kept its two-week stretch run intact, getting as high as 108.87 before finishing the day up 1.2% at 107.10 — up more than 220% since shares bolted out of a second-stage cup with handle in mid-March at 33.17.Apple (AAPL) dropped to as low as 115.64 before edging back to cut the loss to a reasonable 0.7% at 116.22. As noted in Wednesday's Stock Market Today column, the iPhone and iPad giant could be poised to form a proper handle, which would be in line with its prior action over the past 12 years that ushered new breakouts and outstanding price gains.Apple remains up 5% past a prior 110.33 buy point in a cup with handle that sits within a much larger, deeper bottoming base pattern.The Nasdaq composite fell 0.4% after being down as much as 0.7%. The Nasdaq 100, however, lost just 0.3% and the NYSE composite eased less than 0.3%. The S&P 500 gave back less than 0.2%, the Dow Jones industrials just 0.1%.Five Dow 30 components, including integrated oil major Chevron (CVX), 3M (MMM) and Verizon (VZ), rose half a point or more to buffer the index's slide. But the Russell 2000 sank 0.9%, now on pace for a slight decline for the week.Investors did not react that wholeheartedly to the bigger than expected 3.5% final print on Q3 U.S. GDP annualized growth. The price index gained modestly and less than the 2% minimum target of the Federal Reserve.Returning to Nvidia, one major reason why it's been acting so well: The champion of innovative graphics processors, or GPUs, is feeding off the strength of the fabless chip firms as a whole.As the world gets increasingly digital and more machines join the IoT era, Nvidia and its peers are seeing rosy demand for semiconductors that can process heavy loads of data and information and allow devices to become more intelligent.Besides Nvidia, at least 14 more companies in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group post a Composite Rating of 90 or higher, and all 15 trade at least 10 a share — from small caps Semtech (SMTC), Silicon Laboratories (SLAB) and China's Alpha & Omega Semiconductor (AOSL) to mid- and large-cap names Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Xilinx (XLNX).Xilinx recently cleared a 54.39 entry in a cup with handle base and has risen nearly 12% in less than four weeks so far.You can see all of the names that make up the Chips sector by going to Stock Lists at Investors.com, clicking on ""IBD Data Tables,"" then selecting the Nasdaq + NYSE Smart Tables.Research by IBD has found that up to half of a great stock market winner's overall price move is generated by the strength of its broad sector and individual industry group.Nvidia's fabless semi group is currently 10th out of 197 IBD industry groups and subgroups in terms of relative six-month performance and is up more than 43% YTD.RELATED:Why Nvidia's Fundamentals Could Turn It Into The Next AppleInvesting To Win: Pearls Of Wisdom From Wall Street Great Gerald LoebThe Big Picture: What Do Economists Fear The Most In 2017?When Did Apple Initially Break Out?The Bottoming Base Pattern, And How Apple Formed One In 2009

104,XLNX,"American Century Ultra (TWCUX), a marquee name in the mutual fund industry, had a dynamite third quarter. Its 6.49% gain popped past the 5.59% average surge of its large-cap growth rivals as tracked by Morningstar. And the fund soared above the S&P 500, which tacked on a relatively modest 3.85% advance.So far in Q4 the $8.2 billion mutual fund is down 1.93%, going into Thursday. A lot of that is due to a slide by technology and tech-related names that dominate the fund's top holdings. They have been out of investors' favor in recent weeks. Until this past week, that is.A sustained rebound by those names could give a nice boost to the fund — Tuesday and Wednesday those names showed signs of doing that.Four tech or tech-related names are top-10 holdings that have IBD Composite Ratings of 80 or higher. So does top new buy Xilinx (XLNX).IBD'S TAKE: The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher, which means that they've outperformed 95% of all other stocks in terms of their Composite Rating.Apple (AAPL), the top holding as of Aug. 31, was down 7% since Oct. 24. Alphabet (GOOGL) was down 7%. Amazon.com (AMZN) was down 11%. Facebook (FB) was down 17%. All had portfolio weightings of 8% to 4% as of Aug. 31Three gained ground Tuesday and Wednesday. Facebook and Xilinx rose on Tuesday.They had sold off amid investors' worries that multinational companies like those are high-profile targets for retaliation by foreign governments if President-elect Donald Trump sparks a trade war.One big change for the fund since IBD last profiled it in May: While information technology remains its largest sector, now with a weighting of 33%, consumer discretionary has replaced health care in the second slot with a 22% weighting. Health care still has a 17% weighting but has fallen to the sixth position.Amazon — which combines online retailing with its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-services platform — is the biggest consumer discretionary name. Starbucks (SBUX) is another. The coffee-shop chain has a modest 70 Comp Rating. Shares recently retook their 10-week moving average, a sign its recent downtrend may be ending.Meanwhile, some health care holdings have already provided lift for American Century Ultra, with runs that began in the days before the election.Managed care provider UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and biotech Celgene (CELG) are among the fund's top 10 holdings and have Comp Ratings of 88 and 97 respectively. They benefited as investors rotated into health care stocks amid expectations that a Republican Congress and White House will ease pressure for new pricing rules for drugs. Investors also expect ObamaCare to be reformed.In addition, the market reacted favorably to UnitedHealth's profitable third quarter reported last month — earnings per share rose 23% — and to its raised guidance for 2016.Celgene's Q3 revenue jumped 28% as EPS grew 28%. In addition to productive products Revlimid, Pomalyst, Otezla and Abraxane, Celgene got multiple sclerosis treatment ozanimod in its 2015 acquisition of Receptos. It's also being tested for treating ulcerative colitis. And mongersen is being studied for treatment of Crohn's disease.Wall Street analysts are forecasting 22% earnings growth over the next five years.Donaldson (DCI) also got a postelection boost. The maker of air and liquid filtration systems is up on expectations that a Trump administration will seek infrastructure improvements. EPS grew 16% and 2% the past two quarters after four stanzas of slowing growth.Scripps Networks (SNI), which runs six national media networks and has an 86 Comp Rating, broke out above a flat-base buy point of 68.54 Monday. AT&T's (T) pursuit of Time Warner (TWX) — whether a Trump administration would green-light the deal or not — shows the value of media content.IBD's TAKE: Take a look at IBD's Stock Checkup to learn how four consecutive years of EPS growth and annual return on equity of 44.3% help make Scripps the No. 1 stock in IBD's diversified-media industry group.Xilinx in October pulled back 12% after setting a 52-week high, but has since regained most of the loss. The chip designer, which has a 90 Comp Rating, had EPS growth of 8%, 11% and 27% the past three quarters. Those steps up followed five frames of declining EPS growth. The most recent results, for Q2, beat many analysts expectations. The stock also has a 2.5% dividend yield.The California-based chipmaker's industrial-defense division — whose sales rose 11% in Q2 — could benefit from a boost in defense spending under Trump.RELATED:How A Top Mutual Fund Plays This Volatile MarketAmerican Century Ultra Stays Focused On Leaders

105,XLNX,"Apple (AAPL) and the iPhone ecosystem owe much of their torrid growth to the 3G and 4G wireless networks that whisked games, apps, photos and video to the computerlike smartphones.Now the 5G, or fifth generation, wireless revolution is near, promising data speeds 50 to 100 times faster than 4G LTE networks. Sure it'll improve smartphones, but that's not the point. Analysts say 5G's biggest impact will be to drive the proliferation of the Internet of Things — billions of connected devices.The business case for 5G is all about IoT, an evolution, or maybe revolution, that will take the internet era into new territories. Companies including chipmakers, network equipment makers and telecom service providers are investing heavily in the technology, with the first products to roll out in 2017.""With 5G, there are going to be many more device categories,"" Matt Grob, Qualcomm chief technology officer, told IBD.IBD'S TAKE: 5G holds big promise for the future, but how are key players performing now? One company worth watching is Arista Networks, a 2014 IPO that is battling Cisco Systems, the longtime networking gear leader. Arista is on the IBD 50 ranking of the top-performing stocks,  a good place to look for stocks possibly worth buying.IoT encompasses such burgeoning arenas as self-driving cars, advanced robotics, telemedicine, automated factories, smart cities and the development of massive sensor networks in such fields as agriculture. Farmers will, for example, know exactly when to harvest for best yields based on air temperature and soil moisture.Many of the companies aiming to put 5G on the fast track — Qualcomm (QCOM), Intel (INTC), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Verizon Communications (VZ) to name a few — expect new revenue streams from the IoT and game-changing apps outside of smartphones.Qualcomm aims to ship its first 5G modem chips for phones in the second half of 2017, with follow-on chips targeting the IoT.Qualcomm, like others, expects 5G to evolve on multiple tracks: IoT, smartphones and fixed residential. While Apple, Samsung and others will ship 5G smartphones only after standards are rubber-stamped, which observers say will be a work in progress until 2020 or later, carriers are closer with ""fixed"" 5G, a wireless broadband service provided from a fixed point to homes in limited areas. If  fixed 5G to homes works well in trials, Verizon says it will pursue a commercial rollout city-by-city in 2018 and 2019. It hasn't identified the cities yet.With 4G networks, it costs wireless firms about $1 to deliver a gigabyte of data. 5G networks promise much better economics. It also will provide virtually uninterrupted communications for new apps.""5G is going to bring lower costs per bit, lower latency and highly reliable services,"" Grob said. ""So it's going to be great for autonomous vehicles, medical devices and for infrastructure and smart cities. There are more companies taking part in the standards development for 5G than ever.""Medical applications include remote monitoring of devices like EKGs or blood pressure monitors. Smart city technologies include traffic signals that adjust to vehicle flows and sensor-based water systems that test for contaminants in real time.The Internet of Things isn't waiting on 5G. AT&T (T) already has some 8 million web-connected cars linked to its 4G network. U.K.-based Vodafone (VOD) says it had 41 million IoT connections as of Sept. 30. Cisco says its gear links 4.9 billion devices now and will connect 12.2 billion by 2020, and few will be 5G.But the more speed, the better.Some companies might get a good boost early in the 5G revolution, such as makers of network testing gear like Keysight Technology (KEYS). Independent testing is a big part of the standards-setting process.Early on, analysts say Xilinx (XLNX) programmable chips will be useful for prototyping 5G products, while the higher radio frequency bands associated with 5G may create long-term opportunities for RF chip leaders Broadcom (AVGO) , Qorvo (QRVO) and Murata.As small cells are deployed in urban areas, cell tower firm Crown Castle (CCI) and startup Tarana Wireless aim to capture share. Tarana's biggest investor is AT&T. Some analysts view Zayo Holdings (ZAYO) as a takeover candidate, because small cell systems require fiber-optic links in metro areas for long-haul transport.Next-generation data centers — to keep all these things humming on the internet — will be another battleground, as Cisco takes on Arista Networks (ANET), startup Affirmed Networks and others.Meanwhile, startup SigFox, the LoRa alliance — with members including Cisco and IBM (IBM) — and others aim to provide all IoT devices with low-power connections via Wi-Fi and unlicensed spectrum.5G backers aim to create flexible networks that provide both the high-bandwidth connections required by fast-moving, self-driving cars in urban areas and always-on, reliable, low-data-rate connections needed by parking meters, oil rig sensors or other devices.While 4G networks provide cars with infotainment, 5G services are expected to provide real-time environmental data so, for example, driverless cars can avoid collisions.To service various types of devices, wireless networks will need to utilize both very high radio frequencies not yet commercialized and lower-band airwaves. Improved radio antennas and more complex semiconductors are expected to make higher frequencies usable for 5G.In urban areas, hundreds of ""small cell"" antennas hung on utility poles or buildings will work together, analysts say.Wireless networks and telecom data centers will be upgraded to provide both high and low data rate services, again to service various types of sensors and devices. AT&T and Verizon are among the leaders in moving to software-defined-network technology. SDN will help usher in 5G. With it, wireless firms can improve network bandwidth allocation and provide cloud-based, on-demand services.Part of the 5G revolution involves connecting a network of data centers to the IoT. That's a focus for Intel, Cisco, China's Huawei and many other companies.""5G will be a whole transformation of the network to virtualization, providing more flexibility and agility,"" said Jean Luc Valente, vice president of product management for Cisco's cloud and virtualization group. ""With 5G, with connected cars, some data is going to be collected, maybe at a traffic light intersection. Those data nuggets will be (analyzed), maybe not in the back-end data center, maybe much closer in a micro-cloud."" The upshot, among many benefits, is that self-driving cars won't collide.Cisco aims to provide cloud-based IoT services as it shifts away from hardware sales. The company partnered in February with Intel and Sweden's Ericsson (ERIC) to start selling a swath of 5G hardware and services. They are involved in 5G trials by Verizon and others.As 5G sparks partnerships, it's also generating M&As with 5G or IoT angles.Qualcomm expects its pending acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) to pay dividends in autonomous cars. Japan-based SoftBank acquired wireless chip designer ARM Holdings for $31 billion with an eye toward I0T.AT&T says it will move to 5G faster if regulators approve its acquisition of media giant Time Warner (TWX), part of its strategy to whisk more video to mobile devices.Cisco bought Jasper in March for $1.4 billion, gaining a cloud-based IoT platform. Verizon in February announced an agreement to acquire XO Communications, which owns high-frequency spectrum for 5G services, for $1.8 billion.Internet leaders, too, are jockeying for leading roles in 5G. Facebook (FB) is working with equipment vendors and carriers on standards. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) is developing open software for the IoT.For Intel, 5G and IoT offer an opportunity to turn its money-losing mobile business around, says Citigroup. For Qualcomm, the shift to 5G should provide higher profit margins as the 4G generation matures.South Korea's KT and Verizon are forging ahead in prestandard deployment of 5G, aiming to drive technical specifications for 5G radio gear. KT plans to showcase 5G technology at the 2018 Winter Olympics, though just how isn't known.Aside from the Internet of Things and 5G mobility, Verizon is eyeing fixed 5G wireless broadband services to homes, potentially taking on cable TV companies. It's not clear yet if 5G fixed broadband could provide high-speed internet in neighborhoods or blanket bigger areas, analysts say. The Verizon trials will help determine that.Verizon has been investing across the board — in SDN, small cell technology and fixed wireless, says Adam Koeppe, vice president of technology planning at Verizon.""We're putting in the building blocks for what comes next. IoT is one of them,"" he said. ""The goal of the IoT device evolution is to have very low-cost modules, with long battery life. Think of sensors, smart meters — things that get embedded in day-to-day infrastructure and products that communicate on low bandwidth, on a sliver of spectrum, gobbling up very little of network resources.""""Where 5G fits into the equation is scale,"" Koeppe added. ""IoT will be about tens of billions of devices connected to the network. When you think of truly connected societies — traffic lights, stop signs, parking meters and everything within a city connected and interacting with itself — that's where 5G comes into play.""Yet 5G-related revenue is still on the distant horizon for most companies, analysts say. The marketing hype has picked up long before 5G networks and services will be deployed.IoT revenue is about 1% of global mobile revenue now and will grow at about 20% annually over the next five years, says market research firm Analysys Mason. Revenue is small in part because monthly revenue from IoT devices might come to just $1 or $2, not the $60 or more from smartphone users.RELATED:Qualcomm Upgraded On NXP Acquisition, Adds 'Tons Of Scale'Verizon Among Those With Lots At Stake With Next FCC ChairmanCisco Rival Arista Soars On Import Green Light

107,XLNX,"Programmable chip maker Xilinx (XLNX) fanned acquisition rumors Wednesday and an MKM analyst suggested a marriage with Apple (AAPL) supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) would make ""strategic sense.""Xilinx stock soared as much as 12% in the morning on the stock market today, after late Wednesday Xilinx filed ""change of control"" documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In afternoon trading, shares were up 10%.Analysts pegged Xilinx as a takeover candidate amid chip M&A furor that hit a fever pitch in 2015. Deals last year topped a record $100 billion as the industry slows, competition mounts and macro uncertainties surrounding China continue.Xilinx Tops Q3 Sales ViewsIn conjunction with the SEC filing, Xilinx reported fiscal Q3 sales that topped the consensus model of 24 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. For its Q3 2016 ended Jan. 2, Xilinx reported $566 million in sales vs. analyst views for $554.5 million. Three months ago, Xilinx guided to between $543 million and $565 million in sales.But Q3 sales fell 5% vs. the year-earlier quarter, and earnings per share ex items of 49 cents were merely in line with analyst expectations. EPS fell 21% year over year.For the current quarter, Xilinx guided to flat sequential sales. That would be in line with the company's year-ago results and meet Wall Street forecasts for $565.9 million, William Blair analyst Anil Doradla wrote in a research report.During Q3, Xilinx's communications unit grew 12% sequentially to $243 million vs. consensus expectations for $231 million, MKM analyst Ian Ing wrote in a report. The industrial unit, too, grew 7% quarter over quarter to $323 million, topping analyst views for $228 million.But the company's auto unit fell 4% sequentially on ""the timing of automotive program purchases,"" Ing wrote.Long term, growth within the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) industry is somewhat strangled, Ing and Doradla wrote. Altera, a former programmable-chip rival, was just swallowed into Intel (INTC) for $16.7 billion.M&A 'Smoke' Billowing XilinxFor Xilinx, FPGAs have grown at mid-single-digits vs. earlier ambitions of double digit growth, Ing wrote. That, combined with Xilinx's lack of a March analyst day, has created some ""smoke"" screening potential M&A activity, he wrote.""We continue to think fabless companies are ripe for consolidation as scale matters more than specialization,"" he wrote. ""Qualcomm for Xilinx to bolster its mobile infrastructure offerings makes strategic sense to us.""Ing maintained his neutral rating and 46 price target on Xilinx stock. Doradla rates Xilinx stock a market perform.Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer sees Xilinx as ""absolutely attractive/accretive to suitors, albeit the ability to pay an Altera-like premium is unlikely.""""Intel was uniquely positioned with their data center group footprint to lever a programmable logic device asset and/or defend its considerable profit pool,"" he wrote.Intel scooped up Altera for $54 per share in a plan announced June 1. That amount was an 11% premium to the prior Friday's closing price, but 56% above where Altera was before rumors of a potential deal first arose March 27, according to Bloomberg. The deal closed in December.Over the last 12 months, the average premium on M&A targets has been 25%, Pitzer wrote. For Xilinx stock, which closed at 43.08 on Wednesday, that implies a purchase price of $54 per share, Pitzer wrote.""Applying an Altera-like price-earnings multiple would drive an upside target of $90,"" he wrote. But that's extremely unlikely, he added.Pitzer reiterated his neutral rating on Xilinx stock but raised his price target to 45 from 38.Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

Other aggressive recruiters of AI data scientists include Amazon, Google, Microsoft and IBM.While the tech industry's incumbents have significant resources to buy what they can't build, venture capitalist are funding a horde of AI startups, notes Goldman Sachs.While Intel and Nvidia aim to be leaders in developing semiconductors for AI apps, ""we have already seen multiple venture backed startups aimed at improving on the existing silicon layer for AI,"" said the Goldman Sachs report. Intel acquired machine learning specialist Nervana in 2016 to boost its AI strategy.""We have identified over 150 private companies in the AI and machine learning space founded over the last 10 years,"" said the report by analyst Heath Terry. ""While we believe that much of the value in AI will accrue to large companies with the resources, data, and ability to invest, we expect that venture capitalists, entrepreneurs and technologists will continue to drive the creation of new companies that will, in turn, drive substantial innovation and value creation through, at the very least, M&A, though we certainly wouldn't dismiss the potential for a 'Google or Facebook of AI' to emerge.""Salesforce.com's AI-related acquisitions include Minhash, PredictionIO and MetaMind. Amazon has bought 2lemetry and Orbeus; Microsoft purchased Equivio, Revolution Analytics, Wand Labs and Genee, the report said.According to a report by CBI Insights, the most well-funded AI software startups include Sentient Technologies, Ayasdi, Digital Reasoning Systems, Vicarious Systems, and DataRobot.Apple stock rose 1.5% to 111.75 in the stock market today, while Nvidia was down 0.4% and Intel shares up 0.1%.RELATED:Nvidia, Intel Battleground Set As Licensing Pact SunsetsFacebook Upside Coming From Growth of 'Bot Economy,' Says CitiNo Need To Ask Jeeves When You Can Ask Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google

111,XLNX,"One chapter in Nvidia's (NVDA) rivalry with Intel (INTC) is nearing an end: Royalty payments from Intel that have boosted Nvidia earnings since 2011 could sunset next year — just as more competition unfolds between them in data centers, self-driving cars and augmented reality.Both Intel and Nvidia, whose stock has jumped 103% in 2016 after slipping a fraction on Friday, stick out as chipmakers hunting for the next killer app. Mobile phone sales are slowing globally, much as the PC market did earlier. Intel and Nvidia aim for leadership in semiconductors used in cars, artificial intelligence and visual processing.The moves into new markets are panning out, but Nvidia still gets 60% of revenue from PC graphics and gaming.Intel, which in Q2 derived 54% of its revenue from its PC unit, recently acquired startups in the AI and visual computing fields. Observers wonder what Nvidia might buy, with nearly $5 billion in cash on its balance sheet.But where Intel has had four chief executives since Nvidia was founded in 1993, Nvidia has had one CEO: Jen-Hsun Huang, one of Nvidia's three co-founders. The CEO gets kudos for reinventing Nvidia and for his ability to recruit top engineers to the chipmaker.""Jen-Hsun has made several gutsy calls in the past decade,"" Mark Hung, an analyst at tech research firm Gartner, told IBD. ""Some of them worked out very well, a couple not so much. When he sees an opportunity, he's been able to marshal the company's full resources behind it. In data center and automotive, they're charging ahead.""IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia's big year hasn't just been good for a chip company or for a tech company, but for any company. How good? The IBD 50 ranking of top-performing stocks over the past 52 weeks, with an emphasis on the most recent six months, is always a great place to find winners. Nvidia currently ranks No. 5 on that hard-to-make list.Huang is slated to deliver a preshow keynote address at CES 2017 in January and is expected to trumpet emerging gaming and AI technology, as well as AR headsets and self-driving cars. Its chips already help power the instrument and navigation displays in Tesla Motors (TSLA) e-cars and others.Nvidia continues to improve upon the high-end graphics processing that made it the leader in gaming, along with Advance Micro Devices (AMD). An Nvidia edge is that its powerful graphics processors, thanks to their ""parallel-processing"" circuitry, can be extended to artificial intelligence software.AI chips are well-suited for facial or object recognition, a plus for robotics and security applications, as well as spoken-language apps. Much R&D is focused on ""deep learning,"" an AI tool that enables computers to be trained and to perform actual reasoning. Self-driving cars map their surroundings and detect hazards, for example.In self-driving, Nvidia has ""the right product at the right time,"" said Malcolm Penn, founder and CEO of U.K.-based Future Horizons, a semiconductor research firm. ""Autonomous driving is all about vision and parallel processing,"" and Nvidia products are ""perfect for this; Intel ... is not.""Intel's chips still dominate in low-end PC graphics. And its chips are built into most computer servers packed into data centers. Nvidia's chips are gaining in data center gear as well, with technology well-suited for apps such as credit-card fraud-detection systems, says David Kanter, an analyst at Real World Technologies and the Linley Group.Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), Facebook (FB) and others are racing to develop AI-based apps that can be delivered to consumers via the internet cloud. There's another race underway to equip data centers with AI hardware and software.Intel's August acquisition of startup Nervana Systems heated up its rivalry with Nvidia. Nervana's technology processes ""deep learning"" algorithms. For its part, Intel last month acquired startup Movidius, whose visual processors are used in drones, virtual reality devices and autonomous machines.""Intel has only recently started to focus on machine learning and doesn't offer the same level of performance as Nvidia's latest products,"" Kanter said. ""The Nervana acquisition is an attempt by Intel to get expertise in machine learning and defend its territory in the data center.""For its fiscal Q2 ended July 31, Santa Clara, Calif.-based Nvidia's revenue jumped 24% from the year earlier, easily its best showing in at least four years. EPS ex items jumped 56% to 53 cents, its best showing in two years.But for its fiscal 2018 ending Jan. 31, 2018, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters are modeling only 3% full-year EPS growth. That's where the patent cross-licensing deal signed by Intel and Nvidia in 2011 comes in. Intel agreed to pay Nvidia $1.5 billion over six years, or roughly $264 million annually, to settle a patent dispute.In an email, Intel spokesman William Moss declined to comment on whether Intel plans to renew the agreement. Analysts say Nvidia has indicated there won't be a renewal.Nvidia can make up the Intel loss, says William Stein, a SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst. ""Nvidia's margins will be pressured in the near term for the nearly 90%-margin Intel-licensing revenue rolling off in 2017,"" said Stein in a research report. ""We believe this will be more than offset in the long term by growth in the high-margin data center end-market, plus new products in automotive, lifting margins above the corporate average. Increasing ASPs (average selling prices) in gaming will also help.""Some observers speculate that Nvidia could win back some PC business at Apple, where AMD's chips have recently been built into Mac desktops and laptops.Nvidia and AMD talked merger back in 2005. A deal would have created a bigger rival to Intel. Huang wanted to be CEO of the combined chip company, analysts say, and the deal fell apart.M&A has not been a big part of Nvidia's DNA, though it bought U.K.-based Icera for around $370 million in 2011. Nvidia had problems melding Icera's modem technology with its GPUs and wrote down the Icera business in 2015, says Will Strauss, president of market research firm Forward Concepts. While Nvidia has won some design wins in tablets, it's not a volume player in smartphones.With nearly $5 billion in cash on its balance sheet, Nvidia could be primed for acquisitions, Nomura analyst Romit Shah speculated in a September research report.With a market cap over $13.5 billion, Xilinx (XLNX) could be out of Nvidia's reach, but it's a potentially potent combo. ""Nvidia and Xilinx … now that would change the world as we know it,"" said Penn via email. Intel plucked down $16.7 billion in 2015 to buy top Xilinx rival Altera, which like Xilinx has a sizable data center business.Shah speculates that Nvidia might be interested in IBM's (IBM) Power family of processors. IBM and Nvidia have been partners in AI projects.Nvidia garners just over 10% of revenue from its data center business and, for now, only about 8% from automotive. Besides Tesla, Nvidia works with such automakers as Audi, BMW, Honda (HMC), Mercedes-Benz and Volvo, providing technology for infotainment, navigation, digital instrument clusters and advanced driver-assistance systems.Self-driving cars are one big battleground for Intel and Nvidia. Intel has teamed with autonomous-driving tech company Mobileye (MBLY) and Germany's BMW with the goal of bringing a self-driving car to market by 2021.Nvidia's highest-profile customer and partner might be Tesla Motors (TSLA). (Nvidia, by coincidence, has a line of AI and deep-learning platforms brand-named Tesla, but its Tegra line is what is used inside Tesla and other cars.) In August, Nvidia nabbed another biggie, announcing a partnership with China internet giant Baidu (BIDU) to make an autonomous car platform.Self-driving cars would be a big leap forward technologically for the chipmaker, says Kanter, but he says it's far too early to call Nvidia a winner of the race.""It's not clear to me how well Nvidia's expertise will translate outside of gaming and PCs,"" Kanter said. ""Automotive products are totally different from consumer electronics and the car manufacturers play a much more active role in system integration than a PC (maker) like HP (HPQ) or Dell.""There are many other companies that are more specialized in automotive.""RELATED:Nvidia Debuts AI Supercomputer Chip For Self-Driving CarsNvidia Could Provide Graphics Chips For Apple Mac ComputersIntel Among Chipmakers Getting Vote Of Confidence

Asia's markets posted broad losses for a second straight session, with the Shanghai Composite down 3.2%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index ending 1.8% lower and Tokyo's Nikkei 225 taking a 2.4% hit. But stocks in Europe extended early gains into a solid rebound after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi followed the bank's vote to hold eurozone interest rates steady by saying the bank was preparing to increase its monetary stimulus efforts in March.

118,XLNX,"A Deutsche Bank analyst's October prediction that Micron Technology (MU) will face two ""choppy"" quarters may come to fruition — the No. 5 chipmaker is expected late Tuesday to report a 75% year-over-year drop in earnings.Analyst Sidney Ho, however, said Micron could be helped by cost tailwinds and potential capital expenditure cuts by competing memory suppliers. Micron stock is down 60% for the year.For its fiscal Q1 ended early this month, Micron is expected to report 23 cents earnings per share ex items on $3.46 billion in sales, down 75% and 24%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter.Three months ago, Micron guided to $3.35 billion to $3.6 billion in sales and 20-26 cents EPS minus items.Micron stock fell 2.7% on Monday, after the chipmaker announced the $3.2 billion deal to acquire Taiwan chipmaker Inotera Memories. But Micron rose 2% for the week, including rising a fraction on Friday.And at least six analysts reiterated buy ratings on Micron stock this week following the Inotera announcement.Per the agreement, Micron will pay 30 New Taiwan dollars, or 92 cents, per Inotera share. Micron already owns 33% of Inotera and the two companies have been memory chip partners for seven years.The acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to Micron's EPS, free cash flow, gross margins and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). The companies have 60 days to terminate the agreement.M&As Breach $100 Bil MarkMicron's $3.2 billion Inotera acquisition is just a drop in the $100 billion-plus chip industry M&A bucket for 2015. Big deals included Apple (AAPL) supplier Avago's (AVGO) $37 billion offer for Broadcom and the $19 billion marriage between SanDisk (SNDK) and Western Digital (WDC).Analysts expect the M&A fever to continue into 2016 as the semiconductor industry faces slowing organic growth, rising costs and a limp global economy. Complicating the matter: China wants in on the action and Tsinghua Unigroup has pledged $47 billion to leapfrog Qualcomm (QCOM) to become the No. 3 chipmaker.The Tsinghua push is part of a larger effort by the Chinese government to ease reliance on foreign chips, in part to reduce cybersnooping concerns. Groups in Shanghai and Beijing are making similar efforts, pulling from a $100 billion, government-sponsored pool.This year, Tsinghua Unigroup reportedly made an unsolicited $23 billion bid for Micron. U.S. regulations likely would have stopped the theoretical merger and the offer seems to have fallen off the map.As M&A activity hits new fever pitches in 2016, analysts see smaller chip companies Xilinx (XLNX), Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) and Cavium (CAVM) as possible takeover candidates.Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

124,XLNX,"Flipping The Paradigm
"
125,XLNX,"China plans to flip a longstanding paradigm. The country consumes roughly half the world's $350 billion in chips, but only accounts for 2.5% of the sector's revenue, according to Nanochip Fab Solutions . Chips, in fact, are China's biggest import, says Nanochip.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) follows in value at $118 billion, but it's a manufacturer that doesn't design its own chips, so it's in a little bit of a different market, with thinner profit margins. Qualcomm is No. 4 in chip company market value, near $73 billion.

"
134,XLNX,"Tsinghua already has invested billions in chip acquisitions, buying China chipmakers Spreadtrum Communications for $1.8 billion and RDA Microelectronics for $900 million in 2013 and 2014. But getting its hands on a U.S. company is much more difficult, since the U.S. aims to protect its chip industry trade secrets and intellectual property.
"
135,XLNX,"In August, Tsinghua made an unsolicited $23 billion bid for Boise, Idaho-based Micron, showing its serious interest in flash memory technology. Wall Street scoffed, saying the U.S. Department of Defense would block that transaction. And the informal bid seemingly has gone nowhere.

Semiconductors are a heavily regulated resource, appearing 41 times on the Bureau's controlled list.But it's possible Tsinghua found a loophole.Last month, Tsinghua invested $3.8 billion in Irvine, Calif.-based Western Digital (WDC), a month after Western Digital agreed to buy Milpitas, Calif.-based flash chip maker SanDisk (SNDK) for $19 billion.By investing in Western Digital, Tsinghua got itself that much closer to U.S. chip patents, Summit Research analyst Srini Sundararajan told IBD.""Tsinghua put in $3.8 billion into Western Digital so they would have SanDisk technology,"" he said.China could also make a play for Milpitas, Calif.-based GlobalFoundries, the manufacturing spinoff of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) with fabs in Singapore, Germany and the U.S. Oil-rich Abu Dhabi owns the company and might be looking for a buyer.To compete with the mature U.S. semiconductor market, Tsinghua ""needs to bulk up,"" Maire said. Fabs such as GlobalFoundries and Taiwan Semiconductor carry significant heft.""With Micron, U.S. legislators would never let that go through,"" he said. ""But (Tsinghua) could get around (U.S. regulations) and get around the technological hurdles by cutting a deal with GlobalFoundries.""I wouldn't call it subterfuge, but it would be an interesting back door for China to get its hands on crucial U.S. semiconductor technology.""'Mattson And Chinese Dragon'Chinese involvement aside, 2015 marked a record M&A year for the rapidly consolidating semiconductor industry. The trend looks to continue in 2016, Lidow said.""Just about any of the second- and third-tier semiconductors are probably going to be involved in M&A activity over the next couple of years — Cypress Semiconductor (CY), Micron, GlobalFoundries, Maxim, Xilinx,"" he said.Maire also cites Axcelis Technologies (ACLS), Rudolph Technologies (RTEC), Nanometrics (NANO), Nova Measuring (NVMI) and Ultratech (UTEK) as potential acquisition targets.Chip giants Texas Instruments (TXN), Intel and Samsung are safe — for the time being, Lidow said. He estimates it would take a Chinese company five years after a major acquisition to make any dominant inroads in the semiconductor world.Beijing-based E-Town Dragon Semiconductor Industry Investment Center, not Tsinghua, has already begun its efforts on that cycle, this month announcing an agreement to acquire Mattson Technology (MTSN), a maker of chip-manufacturing gear based in Fremont, Calif., for $12.2 million.Acquiring Mattson is just a drop in the ""proverbial bucket,"" Maire wrote in a research report. E-Town's plans remain veiled, but regulators will likely approve the acquisition, as ""Mattson has no advanced technology the U.S. government would be concerned about,"" he wrote.""It will be an interesting test as this is the first Chinese acquisition of a U.S. semiconductor company,"" Maire wrote. But ""this is not a very bold start, buying the worst equipment company as compared to the very bold bid by the Chinese to buy Micron.""He added: ""Even if the Micron bid was doomed from the start, it was certainly headline grabbing.""Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

156,XLNX,"Texas Instruments (TXN) and Mellanox Technologies (MLNX) topped analysts' Q3 views late Wednesday and, on Thursday, both semiconductor companies enjoyed price target hikes and increases on Wall Street.
"
157,XLNX,"And, although Texas Instruments isn't publicly acquisitive, at least one analyst suggested it might need to jump on the recent semiconductor M&A bandwagon.

159,XLNX,"TI Delivers 'Clean' EPS Beat
"
160,XLNX,"For Q3 ended Sept. 30, Texas Instruments reported 76 cents earnings per share ex items on $3.43 billion in revenue vs. the consensus which saw 68 cents and $3.28 billion.
"
161,XLNX,"Both measures were lackluster compared with Q3 2014. Revenue fell 2% and EPS was flat.
"
162,XLNX,"Texas Instruments guided down 2% for Q4 revenue at $3.07 billion to $3.33 billion. The company modeled 64-74 cents EPS which would be flat year over year.
"
163,XLNX,"MKM Partners analyst Ian Ing noted Texas Instruments' apparent reluctance to jump on recent M&A activity. During the Q3 conference call Wednesday, CFO Kevin March said other semiconductor companies appear to be building scale through mergers.
"
164,XLNX,"""We already have what we believe is a significant scale advantage and we believe we're focused on the two best opportunities that are out there today, being analog and embedded processing,"" March told analysts. ""So those two reasons aren't motivating us to think differently about M&A.""
"
165,XLNX,"That line of thinking could be Texas Instruments' downfall, Ing wrote in a research report.
"
166,XLNX,"""Assuming robust M&A activity, we think the potential exists for the creation of an analog competitor with comparable scale and cost leadership,"" he wrote. ""Texas Instruments may need to respond pre-emptively and become acquisitive.""
"
167,XLNX,"In Q3, Texas Instruments delivered ""a clean 8-cent EPS beat,"" Ing wrote.
"
168,XLNX,"Revenue drivers included analog and embedded processing which comprised 85% of Q3 sales, Vice President Dave Paul said during the call. Wireless infrastructure and industrial markets were stronger than expected, but communications equipment fell 30% vs. the year-earlier quarter.
"
169,XLNX,"Ing remained cautious on macroeconomic concerns in wireless infrastructure. He rates Texas Instruments stock a neutral and bumped his price target to 55 from 48.

170,XLNX,"Mellanox Nearly Doubles EPS
"
171,XLNX,"Chip designer Mellanox smashed Wall Street's Q3 views with 75 cents EPS ex items on $171.4 million in revenue, up 97% and 42% respectively vs. the year-earlier quarter.
"
172,XLNX,"It was the company's fifth consecutive beat, Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski wrote in a report. Nowinski rates Mellanox stock as overweight with a 60 price target.
"
173,XLNX,"For the current quarter, Mellanox guided to $171 million to $176 million in sales, which would be up 23% at the midpoint vs. Q3 2014.
"
174,XLNX,"Summit Research analyst Srini Nandury credited 72.9% gross margins and slowing operating expenses for ""the EPS home run"" and said Q4 revenue guidance was too conservative given Mellanox's three-year Q4 growth average of 29.4%.
"
175,XLNX,"""Given their results and strength across all end markets, new products ramping up, continued strength of existing products as well as leverage in opex, we find Q4 guidance conservative and likely beatable,"" Nandury wrote in a report.
"
176,XLNX,"Deal momentum also continued in Q3 heading into Q4, Nandury wrote.
"
177,XLNX,"Among those, he listed Mellanox's partnership with Qualcomm (QCOM) and Xilinx (XLNX) for an ARM-based data-center-on-a-chip which, analysts say, could be dangerous for rival Intel (INTC).
"
178,XLNX,"Nandury reiterated his buy rating for Mellanox stock and a price target of 65.
"
179,XLNX,"Revenue growth in Q3 was driven by Mellanox's Infiniband and Ethernet, 78% and 21%, respectively, CFO Jacob Shulman told analysts during the Q3 earnings conference call Wednesday. Infiniband sales grew 44% year over year and Ethernet sales shot up 83% vs. the year-earlier quarter.
"
180,XLNX,"Mellanox expects to close its EZchip (EZCH) acquisition in Q1 2016. FBN analyst Shebly Seyrafi sees the purchase adding $137 million in incremental revenue for Mellanox.
"

276,XLNX,"Wall Street pitted No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) against Apple (AAPL) chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) on Friday in a battle for data-center market share.The clash comes as Intel, after the close Tuesday, is expected to report roughly in-line Q3 revenue and an 11% decline in earnings per share ex items vs. the year-earlier quarter.Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel has owned the market for chips that power data-center servers, Richard Windsor, an analyst with Edison Investment Research, wrote in a research report Friday. On Thursday, Qualcomm announced an ARM-based data-center system-on-a-chip.""Over the years, server processors have consolidated in the hands of a couple of heavyweights, so competition could do the industry some good,"" Qualcomm wrote on its website.San Diego-based Qualcomm, with help from partners Xilinix (XLNX) and Mellanox (MLNX), could pose a threat to Intel, said Windsor. Intel sells $12 billion to $14 billion annually to data centers and enjoys 90% of the market, he said.""Qualcomm is the king of execution, and if it can get a foot in the door, then there could be real trouble on the horizon for Intel,"" Windsor wrote.Qualcomm, though, is planning a realignment and in July announced it would cut 15% of its workforce, or some 4,700 jobs.An ARM processor in general uses less power and generates less heat than its Intel counterpart.""The net result is substantially lower running costs because power is far and away the biggest operating expense of a data center,"" Windsor wrote.To be truly competitive, Qualcomm will need to completely rewrite its software. But that's what big ecosystems like Google (GOOG), Facebook (FB) and Apple want, he wrote.""This gives them the ability to do whatever suits them in the data center,"" he explained.MKM analyst Ian Ing, on the other hand, sees Intel and Qualcomm as complementary. Their cooperation ""increasingly makes sense,"" he wrote in a report.The semiconductor sphere will likely see more consolidation ""with Intel potentially playing a role,"" Ing predicted.Intel To Report Q3Intel is expected to report an 11% decline in Q3 earnings per share vs. Q3 2014, to 59 cents, according to the consensus of 48 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Analysts expect $14.2 billion in revenue, down 2.5%.Three months ago, Intel guided for $13.8 billion to $14.8 billion in revenue.MKM's Ing forecasts an easy beat for Intel.""Due to low expectations, we think results and guidance at consensus will be viewed as positive,"" he wrote. ""Given the lack of follow-through to recent PC build activity, investors question whether Intel set a high bar with implied Q4 revenue up 4% to 5%.""Intel is beating the odds of the weak PC market, he wrote.""We think Intel was early to fully de-stock (its PC channel inventory) compared to broad-based semi(conductor companies),"" he wrote.Also, demand remains strong in the hyper-scale cloud market, and Intel will likely focus on data centers in 2016, Ing wrote. Servers bring in about 30% of Intel's revenue, Nomura analyst Romit Shah wrote in a research note.Ing rates Intel stock a buy, with a price target of 40. Shah is neutral on Intel stock and has a 33 price target.Intel stock fell 1.2% Friday, to 32.14.

The company began taking orders on Saturday for the new phones, which offer upgraded cameras and fingerprint sensors. The company said phones will begin shipping Sept. 25. Monday's gain lifted Apple shares to just below its 10-week moving average, 13% below a July 20 high and 26% above an Aug. 24 low.Xilinx (XLNX) gapped up nearly 3% in heavy trade, retaking its 10- and 40-week moving averages. Goldman Sachs upgraded the developer of programmable chips to buy, from hold, and put its price target at 50. The stock is climbing the right side of a four-month consolidation, formed within an 18-month depression.Medical laser equipment maker Cynosure (CYNO) muscled up 7% in powerful trade. Stifel upgraded the stock to buy, from hold, with a 44 price target. The report cited stronger-than-expected sales of MonaLisa, a surgical tool used to correct vaginal atrophy. The gain put Cynosure in position to test resistance at its 10-week moving average, 25% above an Aug. 24 low and down 16% from a July 23 high.Yahoo (YHOO) dropped almost 4%, possibly nicked by a 2% stumble by Alibaba (BABA). Yahoo owns 384 million shares — about 15% — of Alibaba. Alibaba slipped 3% in early trade. A Deutsche Bank report trimmed the stock's price target to 85, from 89, after a Saturday Barron's said the stock was likely to drop 50% — a move that would place its price-to-earnings valuation close to that of eBay (EBAY). Yahoo has said it plans to spin off its holdings in Alibaba as a separately traded entity. Yahoo and Alibaba shares have been in deepening corrections since November.

286,XLNX,"China will invest $100 billion over five years to strengthen its chip industry, Morgan Stanley analysts say, with a focus on creating ""national champions"" such as Semiconductor Manufacturing International and Spreadtrum Communications.Bill Lu and nine other Morgan Stanley analysts said in a 41-page research report Monday said while this isn't China's first major attempt to make a big leap in the semiconductor market, ""this time could be different.""""The goal is large but simple — China's semiconductor ambitions are targeted toward areas where it already dominates manufacturing, and where national security is involved,"" the report said. ""It will take several years for China to disrupt new semiconductor markets, but disruptions — notably margin risk — could end up being significant for established players and for the global chip market overall.""Morgan Stanley analysts said China is not spreading its investments broadly, but instead pushing for ""national champions"" in semiconductor segments.""These include one national manufacturing champion Semiconductor Manufacturing International, one assembly subcontractor (Jiangsu Changjiang Electronics Technology), likely local DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) and Nand flash-memory production and one semi equipment company and a few fabless companies such as Spreadtrum Communications and HiSilicon,"" according to Morgan Stanley's report.Opportunities for non-Chinese firms include partnerships such as the one that Intel (INTC) has with Spreadtrum Communications and Rockchip Electronics, and Qualcomm 's (QCOM) joint venture with Semiconductor Manufacturing International.Morgan Stanley analysts also expect opportunities for chip technology licensing companies such as ARM Holdings (ARMH) to find new customers and for chip equipment makers to find new customers. More mergers and acquisitions related to the changing landscape are also likely, according to the report.Intel Price Target CutIn a separate report Monday, Pacific Crest Securities analyst Michael McConnell said after a trip to Asia that he is more positive on fundamentals at ARM, Avago Technologies (AVGO), Qorvo (QRVO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS). Qorvo recently joined the S&P 500 index.McConnell said Nvidia (NVDA) is gaining broader design wins in China following strong orders from Baidu (BIDU), Huawei, Tencent (TCEHY) and Alibaba (BABA).He's ""incrementally more cautious"" on Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Cavium (CAVM), Intel, Xilinx (XLNX) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM).Pacific Crest lowered its price target on Intel stock to 35 from 37, based on the weak outlook for PC demand coupled with a delayed launch of Intel's Skylake processors.Intel stock was down 1.5% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 30.50.The analysts said new products at AMD are not driving design wins at PC customers, while feedback from Asia indicates that Marvell Technology Group's (MRVL) storage business is being affected by solid-state-drive share-loss and ""execution problems.""RELATED:Chip Leader Inphi Finds Support After Sell-Off.

349,XLNX,"Summit Research Partners analyst Srini Sundararajan said in a research note Thursday afternoon that ""despite the news that the Intel-Altera deal is a no-go for now, the rationale still exists for a deal, though the price seems to be too high (Intel apparently walked away at $54, per Bloomberg),"" he said.
"
350,XLNX,"""We thought it important to review the rationale for such a deal one more time: The two primary reasons why Intel wanted Altera are enhancing its server capability using FPGAs (field-programmable gate array, or integrated circuits designed to be configured by customers or a designer after manufacturing), and Intel's preference to keep its foundry business looking good (i.e. potentially not losing marquee clients such as Altera).

496,XLNX," ARM Holdings, long the power player among chip designers for smartphones and tablets, has curbed investor concerns of waning potential and is poised for a strong 2014, analysts say.They see several possible growth drivers for ARM Holdings (ARMH), as customers such as Apple (AAPL) and Samsung roll out new products. There's also word that Google (GOOG) might design its own server processors using ARM Holdings technology, according to a Bloomberg News report last week.""I think ARM is in a phenomenal position headed into next year,"" said Evercore Partners analyst Patrick Wang. ""It is firing on all cylinders.""ARM Holdings is the second-largest firm by market cap in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group, after Qualcomm (QCOM), and before Broadcom (BRCM), Avago Technologies (AVGO) and Xilinx (XLNX).Wang noted that ARM Holdings' stock rode a roller coaster over the past couple of years, dipping below 23 per share in mid-2012 and seesawing the middle of this year before recovering in the fall to approach 50 in October. It now trades just shy of that.For the downs, Wang and others have most recently blamed headlines generated by would-be competitor Intel (INTC), which has made known that it wants to carve out a big share of the smartphone and tablet market. This, the thinking went, would come at ARM Holdings' expense.Rivals And AlliancesIntel, the world's largest semiconductor company, has dominated the arena of chipmaking for conventional personal computers, but ARM, which counts Intel competitor Qualcomm among its partners, has virtually shut Intel out of the smartphone and tablet space. Yet Intel, at its investor day in November, touted expectations that sales of Intel-based tablet computers will surge past 40 million next year, a jump of more than 300%, with smartphone growth to follow.""I never want to discount Intel,"" Wang said. ""Intel has deep pockets and they really want a piece of this market.""But, he added, Intel executives also said they would consider making microprocessors based on competitors' designs, presumably including ARM Holdings, And since the latter earns royalties on its chip designs, the Intel concession ""would seem to balance things out"" for ARM Holdings.With the Intel head wind seemingly diffused for now, Wang said, ARM Holdings is now ""my top large-cap pick for next year.""Other Wall Street analysts have been upbeat too, issuing outperform and buy ratings.An easing of Intel pressure is hardly all that puts wind into ARM Holdings' sails.The Cambridge, England-based company designs the chips that go into iPhones, iPads and a plethora of other smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices. It earns royalties on every ARM-powered device shipped — accounting for about half its revenue — and collects licensing fees for products in development that use its chips.Despite a 2% year-over-year decline for the semiconductor industry in the third quarter, processor royalty revenue rose about 14% for ARM Holdings, according to the company. That missed estimates, but its licensing income swelled nearly 50%, beating expectations. And earnings per share rose 39% on 28% higher revenue, with both beating consensus views.Analysts have expressed concerns about the saturation of high-end smartphones. There are fewer royalties to be had if most people in the market for such a device already have one and sales slow. But many analysts think this could be offset by greater volumes of mid-tier smartphones being sold in high-growth markets such as China and India.Equally important, on the high-end front, was the move made this year by Apple to shift from the standard 32-bit chips to 64-bit chips in its iPhone 5S.Wang said the change was ""huge"" for two reasons. One, Apple is a major ARM Holdings customer, and two, others will follow Apple's lead.Future DevicesSamsung already has said it will follow suit in 2014. And ARM Holdings generates higher levels of royalties on the faster 64s, making each shipment more profitable.""If not for Apple, others would have taken their sweet time getting to it, but now it becomes essential. And that's a nice tail wind for ARM heading into next year,"" Wang said. ""I think ARM really got its mojo back with the Apple move, because ARM is only as good as its customers.""William Blair & Co. analyst Anil Doradla agreed. ""I like the story; I like the fundamentals,"" he said in an interview.Doradla has a ""market perform"" rating on ARM Holdings ""strictly on valuation,"" meaning he is not yet convinced that there is room for substantial advancement for the stock. He said the 64-bit chip development could help drive growth, and expansion of the mid-tier smartphone market in developing countries should provide another boost.""That market is going to be very positive,"" he said. But he thinks the stock may need another ""upside surprise"" to advance substantially.Wang said Apple may be the one to deliver such a catalyst. Looming from Apple in 2014 is a larger, roughly 12-inch iPad, expected to have a keyboard and other features associated with notebooks and personal computers. It could change the world of business travel, Wang said, and potentially ""change the PC landscape."" That could boost business for ARM Holdings as well.""I think that if and when it comes out — and all signs indicate it in fact will come out — that's the next leg of growth for ARM's stock,"" he said.In the latest news out of the company, ARM Holdings on Friday said it acquired graphics lighting company Geomerics, and that its technology could accelerate the transition to photorealistic games in mobile.ARM Holdings CEO Simon Segars said on the firm's third-quarter earnings conference call that it is increasingly licensing its chip designs to more companies, and that some of these firms are plowing into cutting-edge areas such as fingerprint recognition and wearable computing, providing new growth opportunities.""A record 48 processor licenses were signed in the (third) quarter with 24 companies,"" Segars said. That included 11 firms with their first-ever ARM license, ""many of whom are planning to take our technology into new and emerging markets.""Looking toward the fourth-quarter's results, he said, a ""record order backlog"" and ""robust opportunity pipeline"" point to a strong quarter for licensing revenue, with a sequential rise in ARM's royalty revenue.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters on average forecast EPS at 26 cents for the fourth quarter and 98 cents for 2013, then $1.24 in 2014.

564,XLNX,"Altera's (ALTR) third-quarter sales slipped, surprising analysts who were looking for a slight increase, and fourth-quarter sales are seen dropping further.

Sales edged down 1% to $522.5 million, missing views of $541.6 million. But in…
"
565,XLNX,"The rapid buildout of next-generation networks across the globe has been a boon to chipmakers over the past several quarters.
"
566,XLNX,"Financial growth has been robust across the sector. Meanwhile, shares of many semiconductor firms are trading at their highest point in years.
"
567,XLNX,"The challenge now is maintaining growth as prior-year comparisons get tougher and some markets begin to mature.
"
568,XLNX,"Chipmaker Altera (ALTR) has come face to face with that challenge. The company makes programmable chips and other gear used in wireless, computer networking, military, automotive and industrial gear.
"
569,XLNX,"Altera has been on an extended run of robust financial growth thanks to heavy demand on a number of fronts, including the rise of 4G networks in developed countries and the buildout of 3G networks in developing countries.
"
570,XLNX,"The company had delivered four straight quarters of triple-digit earnings growth before last quarter, when it fattened the bottom line 36%. Sales have risen at least 36% in each of the past five quarters.
"
571,XLNX,"Altera's shares touched a 10 1/2-year high of 49.59 on April 29.
"
572,XLNX,"Shift To Devices
"
573,XLNX,"One reason for Altera's success is the ongoing shift to the kind of programmable logic devices (PLDs) it specializes in. PLDs are used in cellphone base stations, network routers, digital cameras and other items. These chips offer greater flexibility than other chips and are often more cost-effective.
"
574,XLNX,"Industry researcher Gartner recently estimated that PLD shipments will enjoy 15.6% annual compounded growth from 2009 to 2014. That compares with 9.6% growth over the entire semiconductor sector.
"
575,XLNX,"The strength of its end markets is one reason Altera trades at a premium to the sector as a whole. The company also earns high marks for the execution of its growth strategy, analysts say.
"
576,XLNX,"""Given the company's growth vector and high margins, this premium is deserved,"" Citigroup's Glen Yeung noted in a report.
"
577,XLNX,"Altera's main rival in the PLD space is Xilinx (XLNX), which is also based in San Jose. Though Xilinx's financial growth has been similar to Altera's over the last several quarters, its shares trade at around 25% less.
"
578,XLNX,"Both firms have benefited from a rise in wireless communication infrastructure spending over the past few years. And both face the prospect of much slower financial growth as some of those markets cool down, and as prior-year comparisons become tougher.
"
579,XLNX,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Xilinx to report lower earnings in each of the next four quarters, ending a run of six straight quarters of double-digit-or-better growth.
"
580,XLNX,"Altera should grow earnings 10% this quarter. After that, analysts expect it to report three straight quarters of lower profit.
"
581,XLNX,"Last quarter, the company logged earnings of 68 cents a share. That was up from 50 cents the prior year and came in 3 cents above Thomson Reuters estimates.
"
582,XLNX,"Revenue climbed 33% to $535.8 million, below consensus estimates for $537.9 million.
"
583,XLNX,"Operating margins improved to 46% from 40% a year earlier, thanks in part to a lower one-time charge for employee compensation.
"
584,XLNX,"A slowdown in some end markets during the quarter was offset by strength in other markets, analysts say.
"
585,XLNX,"In a report, JPMorgan analyst Christopher Danely noted that Q1 sales to the Asia-Pacific region decreased 14% from the previous quarter ""due to a slowdown in the telecom and wireless end market in China and India.""
"
586,XLNX,"But, he added, ""North America sales increased 20% quarter over quarter due to strength in the military and industrial end markets.""
"
587,XLNX,"Sales in Europe increased 12% sequentially, while sales in Japan declined 18% sequentially.
"
588,XLNX,"Sales to the telecom and wireless end markets fell 14% sequentially. Sales to the industrial automation, military and automotive end markets increased 25% quarter over quarter.
"
589,XLNX,"Inventory Correction
"
590,XLNX,"Though most analysts sound upbeat about the results, there are a few concerns. One is Altera's ability to implement its inventory correction strategy and improve lead times to customers.
"
591,XLNX,"""Although we believe Altera is mostly through the inventory correction,"" wrote Danely, ""we remain a little concerned that the correction could be so small when Altera is outgrowing its customers, the semiconductor industry and its competitor so much.""
"
592,XLNX,"Overall, however, Wall Street embraced the quarter. The company's stock price rose 4% the day after it reported Q1 results.
"
593,XLNX,"CEO John Daane said in a prepared statement, ""Despite the anticipated slowdown in first-quarter sales following a remarkable 2010 growth year, we experienced double-digit sequential growth in our 40-nm based devices, as these products are now entering the best part of their growth phase.""
"
594,XLNX,"On June 2, Altera affirmed its second-quarter revenue forecast of $535.8 million to $562.6 million. Thomson Reuters analysts expect sales of $548.7 million.

1178,XLNX,"Xilinx Inc. (XLNX  -  Free Report) has performed on par with the industry last year. Both the stock and the industry have rallied 22% in the mentioned timeframe.With expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 9.3% and a market cap of $17.1 billion, it looks like a stock that investors need to hold on to if they are looking to reap long-term gains.Let’s take a look at some of the factors aiding the company’s performance.Xilinx’s broad range of high-performance, high-density programmable logic devices have been witnessing accelerated adoption as evident from its top line. The company recorded revenues of $631.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The figure was above the mid-point of its guidance range of $615-$645 million (mid-point $630 million), as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $630 million.Xilinx, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Xilinx, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Xilinx, Inc. QuoteThe highlight of the quarter was the record quarterly sales figure. It marked the ninth straight quarter of revenue growth. This stellar performance was primarily driven by robust adoption of the company’s 16nm, 20nm and 28nm products.Notably, Xilinx’s ongoing transition from a FPGA provider to an all-programmable devices producer has been helping the company gain market share. Its expanding product portfolio, which includes the Zynq RFSoC platform, is assisting it to counter intense competition from the likes of Intel (INTC  -  Free Report).Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) was the first to use Xilinx chips and started offering FPGA-as-a-Service in May 2017. Since then, the company has won five contracts for FPGA-as-a-Service deployments, which, however, haven’t come online yet. The list includes prominent names like Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) among others.However, Xilinx’s two biggest markets, India and China, continue to be challenged by slow wireless deployments. This makes us slightly cautious about its Communication business.Xilinx currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

1179,XLNX,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Xilinx, Inc. (XLNX  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 1.2% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is XLNX due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Xilinx Q3 Earnings & Revenues Top EstimatesXilinx reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP earnings (excluding one-time items and tax expense due to the enactment of recent Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017) of 76 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents. The figure surged 46.2% from the year-ago quarter and 16.9% from the previous quarter.Revenues for the quarter came in at $631.2 million, which is above the mid-point of its guidance range of $615-$645 million (mid-point $630 million), as well as surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $630 million.Advanced Products Drove Top-Line GrowthManagement noted that Xilinx’s revenues increased for the ninth consecutive quarter, reflecting product strength. This uptick was primarily driven by robust performance of the company’s 16nm, 20nm and 28nm products.Product wise, Advanced product revenues jumped a whopping 30% year over year and 10% sequentially. We note that the segment’s contribution to total revenues was 56%, a significant increase from 47% in the year-ago quarter and 52% reported in the previous quarter.The robust performance of Advanced products was mainly driven by solid demand for its Zynq SoC platform and 20-nm and 16-nm nodes. Revenues from the Zynq SoC platform recorded 40% year-over-year growth, backed by robust demand in all of the company’s end markets, i.e. automotive, industrial, wireless and consumer.The 20-nm sales soared 70% year over year in the reported quarter, chiefly driven by strength in multiple end markets. However, Xilinx noted that the 16-nm was the top performer in the quarter, registering over four-fold jump in revenues. The company shipped 43 unique products to more than 1,160 discrete customers across all end markets.Revenues from core products declined 12% from the year-earlier quarter and 7% sequentially.On basis of the End Market, Communications & Data Center segment revenues (35% of total revenues) dipped 12% year over year and 2% sequentially. The industrial, Aerospace & Defense segment revenues (47% of total revenues) climbed 23% on a year-over-year basis and 7% on a sequential basis. The broadcast, Consumer & Automotive revenues (18% of total revenues) ascended 24% year over year, but declined 3% sequentially.Geographically, the company registered year-over-year growth in every region. Revenues from North America, Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific were up 12%, 11%, 10% and 3%, respectively. Nevertheless, sequentially, Japan was weak, declining 8%. This was fully offset by robust growth from North America, Asia Pacific and Europe, which advanced 3%, 3% and 2%, respectively.Product Strength: Key CatalystXilinx’s ongoing transition from a FPGA provider to an all-programmable devices producer has been helping the company gain market share. Its expanding product portfolio, which includes the Zynq RFSoC platform, is assisting it to counter intense competition from the likes of Intel. The company’s Zynq portfolio, which is implemented in both the 28-nm and 16-nm node, delivered sturdy top-line growth in the quarter.Xilinx noted that it started shipping of the 16-nm RFSoC Silicon In-house family of product in the fiscal second quarter, which offers a superior architectural solution to 5G wireless with integrated RF-class analog technology. The product facilitates reduction of power consumption (50-75%), as well as footprint reduction for future 5G deployments, cable and wireless backhaul applications.Management is also optimistic over the demand of its Ultrascale+ FPGAs data-center operators for providing FPGA-as-a-Service. Amazon    was the first to use Xilinx chips and started offering FPGA-as-a-Service in May 2017.Since then, the company has got five contracts for FPGA-as-a-Service deployments, which, however, haven’t come online yet. The list, which includes the likes of Alibaba, is in the process to deploy two generations of FPGA-as-a-Service by using Xilinx’s Ultrascale+ FPGA chips.Operational DetailsGross margin expanded 150 basis points (bps) year over year to 71.1% and 90 bps sequentially, and came in above the company’s guided range of 69-71%.Operating expenses flared up 6.1% year over year and 3.9% sequentially to $259.3 million. Nonetheless, the figure came in lower than the company’s guidance of $260 million. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses amounted to 41.1%, reflecting contraction of 60 bps on a year-over-year basis, but expansion of 80 bps sequentially.Reduced operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, along with healthy revenue growth and improved gross margin, resulted in year-over-year expansion of 230 bps in operating margin, which came in at 30.1%. On a sequential basis, operating margin improved 20 bps, mainly driven by higher gross margin. Additionally, the company noted that it has achieved its goal of attaining 30% in operating margin one quarter ahead.In dollars, the company posted operating income of $189.7 million, up 16.4% year over year and 2.4% sequentially.The company’s net income came in at $11.9 million, significantly lower than $141.8 million reported in the year-ago quarter, and $167.5 million posted in the fiscal second quarter. The decline was mainly due to a one-time tax expense of approximately $183 million resulting from “the recent enactment of Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017”.Excluding this and other one-time items, non-GAAP net income summed $200.6 million, marking year-over-year growth of 40% and 19.8% sequentially.Balance Sheet, Cash Flow & Shareholders’ ReturnXilinx exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $3.54 billion compared with $3.56 billion recorded in the previous quarter. The company has total long-term debt (excluding current portion) of about $1.73 billion, down from $1.74 billion at the end of the prior quarter.Xilinx generated cash of $184.7 million from operations and incurred $6.8 million as capital expenditure during the third quarter. The company paid $89.5 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 1 million shares for $73.3 million.In the first three quarters of fiscal 2018, the company generated cash of $577.7 million from operations and incurred $28.9 million as capital expenditure. It paid $263.8 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 4.6 million shares for $310.8 million.GuidanceFor fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, Xilinx projects revenues in the range of $635-$665 million (mid-point $650 million). Management projects growth in the Advanced Products segment. Xilinx anticipates the Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive, Communications and the data-center end market to improve year over year. On the other hand, the Industrial and Aerospace & Defense end markets are estimated to remain flat.Gross margin is anticipated to be between 69% and 71%. Operating expenses are likely to decrease to $255 million. During the quarter, Xilinx expects to incur a one-time expense of approximately $30 million due to CEO transition. Tax rate is projected between 0% and 5%.The company remains focused on achieving its fiscal 2018 revenue target of approximately $2.5 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.

1181,XLNX,"Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) delivered the ""earnings trifecta"" on January 24 and shares suffered a stunning reversal of fortune the next day after nearly touching their 52-week high just below $220. I believe this profit-taking is presenting an excellent buying opportunity and this report will explain why.The triple play of earnings goodness I refer to is both top and bottom lines beats and raised guidance for the current quarter, as well as a generally sunny outlook for the coming year. Lam reported Q2 FY2018 (ends in June) EPS of $4.34 vs the Zacks consensus of $3.69 for a 17.6% beat. The company did take a write-down of $757 million to offset tax code changes affecting its over $2.5 billion in overseas cash. So that shows up as an unadjusted loss for the quarter of 6-cents. Revenue in the December quarter rose 37% year-over-year to $2.58 billion vs. analyst models projecting $2.567 billion.Guidance, Estimates and the Zacks RankLam Research generates the majority of its revenue in Asia with large customers like Micron (MU  -  Free Report) and Samsung.After reflecting on another quarter of record results, Lam Research CEO Martin Anstice said the company expects 2018 to bring ""record levels of customer equipment spending and another year of outperformance opportunity for the company."" For the current Q3, Lam management sees revenue in a range of $2.73 billion to $2.98 billion, $200 million ahead (at the midpoint) of the consensus $2.65 billion estimate. EPS is seen in a range of $4.20 to $4.50, versus the Zacks consensus for $3.81.While LRCX is currently a Zacks #2 Rank Buy, the company's raised guidance will inspire Wall Street analysts to start reworking their models and raise their sales and EPS estimates. Within a few days, we should see the Q3 consensus climb 10-15% and get close to that $4.35 midpoint.The full fiscal year (ending in June) should see estimates rise over $15, representing nearly 50% EPS growth and keeping the P/E multiple under 14X.And as top line estimates climb over $10.5 billion, Lam is looking at full-year sales growth of over 30%. CEO Anstice also noted that ""semiconductor innovation is contributing increased value in a data-driven economy and we believe that trend is quite fundamental, exciting and sustainable."" This sounds exactly like the outlook of my December 11 special report for Zacks Confidential, The Technology Super Cycle, where I recommended LRCX shares under $185. Value in Chips? The recent 2018 Barron's Roundtable had as one of its stock-pickers Scott Black, founder of Delphi Management and an old-school value guy. Here's what he said about why you own the Lam...""It is a powerhouse in semiconductor capital equipment, and its products are used primarily in front-end wafer processing, which is becoming a $50 billion business. Lam has a 56%-57% market share in wafer etch, and about a 40% share in vapor deposition. It wants to gain another four percentage points in both through 2019."" Black also addressed Lam's cash position noting the company has $22 a share in net cash with over 70% (approximately $2.8 billion) trapped overseas. ""Exclude that and the stock sells for 11.6 times earnings. It is a giveaway. The average company sells for 19 times earnings, and LAM isn't an average company."" Black describes Lam as having the ""wind at its back"" across multiple industries experiencing strong demand, from memory and flash to the cloud and IoT. And he thinks these growth areas provide positive earnings visibility going out two years. Always Looking for the Semi Cycle Top The negative market reaction in Lam shares immediately following earnings is a bit of a puzzle. Until, that is, you think about the traditional fear in this industry, which saw the Philly Semiconductor Index (SOX) retreat 4% from its all-time highs on Wednesday and Thursday as other chip and equipment makers like Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report), Xilinx (XLNX  -  Free Report) and Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report) also fell between 2% and 5% on Thursday.Technology investors are still prone to seeing a very cyclical industry with brief periods of boom followed buy busts. But this isn't the 1990s and we aren't talking about desktop computers driving demand.This is the age of mobile, datacenters, automotive innovations, robotics and automation, and artificial intelligence. These areas are not slowing down and should provide investors enough visibility that they might think twice and give my ""technology super cycle"" the benefit of the doubt.But one of the big fears for Lam is that memory chip supply will saturate demand in 2019. Since that's about two-thirds of Lam's business, investors are probably somewhat justified in wondering if this is ""as good as it gets"" and the big double-digit growth rates we are accustomed to will drop hard and fast in the next year.The Analysts Chip InSo far, that's not what the investment bank semiconductor analysts are seeing or saying. Here were some of their price target raises as they see the growth trends as ""exciting and sustainable"" as CEO Anstice does..Royal Bank of Canada: from $225 to $245KeyBanc: from $225 to $261Deutsche Bank: from $220 to $240JPMorgan: from $230 to $260Morgan Stanley: from $229 to $238Needham & Company: from $235 to $270Stifel Nicolaus: from $235 to $260Credit Suisse: from $245 to $275Susquehanna: from $250 to $260B.Riley: from $250 to $270Nomura/Instinet: from $230 to $250Price target hikes are nice, but what savvy investors can really sink their teeth into are rising sales and profit estimates. We'll be watching those filter into the Zacks Detailed Estimates page over the coming days and hopefully those numbers will reward those like me who are buying the dip.Disclosure: I own LRCX shares for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

1182,XLNX,"Shares of Xilinx Inc. (XLNX  -  Free Report) rallied during yesterdays’ after-hour trade, after the chipmaker announced overwhelming third-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein its earnings and revenues, both, came ahead of the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, the company beat its guidance at every point.Xilinx reported fiscal third-quarter non-GAAP earnings (excluding one-time items and tax expense due to the enactment of recent Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017) of 76 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents. The figure surged 46.2% from the year-ago quarter and 16.9% from the previous quarter.Revenues for the quarter came in at $631.2 million, which is above the mid-point of its guidance range of $615-$645 million (mid-point $630 million), as well as surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $630 million.Investors’ optimism about the stock has been mainly boosted by some huge accomplishment achieved by Xilinx. The highlight of the quarter was attaining record quarterly sales figure, the ninth straight quarter of revenue growth and reaching 30% of operating margin target well ahead of time.Xilinx, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Xilinx, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Xilinx, Inc. QuoteAdvanced Products Drive Top-Line GrowthManagement noted that Xilinx’s revenues increased for the ninth consecutive quarter, reflecting product strength. This uptick was primarily driven by robust performance of the company’s 16nm, 20nm and 28nm products.Product wise, Advanced product revenues jumped a whopping 30% year over year and 10% sequentially. We note that the segment’s contribution to total revenues was 56%, a significant increase from 47% in the year-ago quarter and 52% reported in the previous quarter.The robust performance of Advanced products was mainly driven by solid demand for its Zynq SoC platform and 20-nm and 16-nm nodes. Revenues from the Zynq SoC platform recorded 40% year-over-year growth, backed by robust demand in all of the company’s end markets, i.e. automotive, industrial, wireless and consumer.The 20-nm sales soared 70% year over year in the reported quarter, chiefly driven by strength in multiple end markets. However, Xilinx noted that the 16-nm was the top performer in the quarter, registering over four-fold jump in revenues. The company shipped 43 unique products to more than 1,160 discrete customers across all end markets.Revenues from core products declined 12% from the year-earlier quarter and 7% sequentially.On basis of the End Market, Communications & Data Center segment revenues (35% of total revenues) dipped 12% year over year and 2% sequentially. The industrial, Aerospace & Defense segment revenues (47% of total revenues) climbed 23% on a year-over-year basis and 7% on a sequential basis. The broadcast, Consumer & Automotive revenues (18% of total revenues) ascended 24% year over year, but declined 3% sequentially.Geographically, the company registered year-over-year growth in every region. Revenues from North America, Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific were up 12%, 11%, 10% and 3%, respectively. Nevertheless, sequentially, Japan was weak, declining 8%. This was fully offset by robust growth from North America, Asia Pacific and Europe, which advanced 3%, 3% and 2%, respectively.Product Strength: Key CatalystXilinx’s ongoing transition from a FPGA provider to an all-programmable devices producer has been helping the company gain market share. Its expanding product portfolio, which includes the Zynq RFSoC platform, is assisting it to counter intense competition from the likes of Intel (INTC  -  Free Report).

Nonetheless, the figure came in lower than the company’s guidance of $260 million. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses amounted to 41.1%, reflecting contraction of 60 bps on a year-over-year basis, but expansion of 80 bps sequentially.Reduced operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, along with healthy revenue growth and improved gross margin, resulted in year-over-year expansion of 230 bps in operating margin, which came in at 30.1%. On a sequential basis, operating margin improved 20 bps, mainly driven by higher gross margin. Additionally, the company noted that it has achieved its goal of attaining 30% in operating margin one quarter ahead.In dollars, the company posted operating income of $189.7 million, up 16.4% year over year and 2.4% sequentially.The company’s net income came in at $11.9 million, significantly lower than $141.8 million reported in the year-ago quarter, and $167.5 million posted in the fiscal second quarter. The decline was mainly due to a one-time tax expense of approximately $183 million resulting from “the recent enactment of Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017”.Excluding this and other one-time items, non-GAAP net income summed $200.6 million, marking year-over-year growth of 40% and 19.8% sequentially.Balance Sheet, Cash Flow & Shareholders’ ReturnXilinx exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $3.54 billion compared with $3.56 billion recorded in the previous quarter. The company has total long-term debt (excluding current portion) of about $1.73 billion, down from $1.74 billion at the end of the prior quarter.Xilinx generated cash of $184.7 million from operations and incurred $6.8 million as capital expenditure during the third quarter. The company paid $89.5 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 1 million shares for $73.3 million.In the first three quarters of fiscal 2018, the company generated cash of $577.7 million from operations and incurred $28.9 million as capital expenditure. It paid $263.8 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 4.6 million shares for $310.8 million.GuidanceFor fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, Xilinx projects revenues in the range of $635-$665 million (mid-point $650 million). The mid-point of the company’s guidance range is currently higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $642.2 million.Management projects growth in the Advanced Products segment. Xilinx anticipates the Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive, Communications and the data-center end market to improve year over year. On the other hand, the Industrial and Aerospace & Defense end markets are estimated to remain flat.Gross margin is anticipated to be between 69% and 71%. Operating expenses are likely to decrease to $255 million. During the quarter, Xilinx expects to incur a one-time expense of approximately $30 million due to CEO transition. Tax rate is projected between 0% and 5%.The company remains focused on achieving its fiscal 2018 revenue target of approximately $2.5 billion.Our TakeXilinx is set to capitalize on the global trend of FPGA replacing application-specified integrated circuits (ASICs). There are certain fundamental advantages of using FPGAs over low-cost ASICs. One of the basic reasons is the difficulty in getting suitable ASICs for design and the additional cost of re-certifying new ASIC-based designs.We expect FPGA products to drive the company’s revenues throughout fiscal 2018, aided by steady demand in the communications industry, and continued strong adoption of its products in Automotive, ISM, Test and Aerospace and Defense markets. Moreover, design wins from other sectors, such as wired communication, data center and industrial, will stoke revenue growth.Furthermore, FPGAs are widely used in third generation (3G) and fourth generation long-term evolution (4G LTE) network connections. These markets are strongly co-related with global GDP growth and spending behavior.Most of the emerging economies are witnessing unprecedented demand for mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, and also getting increasingly connected via the Internet. This has compelled these countries to heavily invest in the Telecom & Wireless infrastructure. We believe higher wireless deployments across the world will lead to heightened demand for Xilinx’s 16-nm, 20-nm and 28-nm nodes, thereby positively influencing its overall financial performance for the next few quarters.Nonetheless, the company’s two biggest markets, India and China, are still facing the challenge of slow wireless deployments, which makes us slightly cautious about its Communication business.Currently, Xilinx carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1183,XLNX,"The earnings season has already started and the picture, so far, appears to be encouraging. Per the Earnings Preview dated Jan 19, nearly 53 of the S&P 500 members have reported their results. Out of these companies, approximately 81.1% delivered positive earnings surprises, while 75.5% surpassed top-line expectations.Notably, earnings for the 53 S&P 500 companies have advanced 11.7% from the same period last year, with revenues up 7.5%. Further, the report suggests that earnings for the total S&P 500 companies for the fourth quarter are projected to improve 10.3% year over year, with total revenues increasing 7.1%.Tech Stocks Continue to OutperformTechnology is one of the six sectors anticipated to report double-digit earnings growth. The other five are Oil/Energy, Basic Materials, Industrial Products, Construction and Autos. Various technology giants, including Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), are scheduled to report their numbers this week. Per the report, total earnings for the tech sector are projected to be up 14.3% on 8.7% higher revenues.We note that the technology sector has been a robust performer over the past year. The sector is benefiting from the increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.Not All Companies are Poised to ImpressThough the overall tech sector is poised to shine in the quarter to be reported, this does not ensure earnings beat for all companies in the space. It should be noted that a company’s earnings outperformance is dependent on the overall business environment as well as management’s ability to implement operating and strategic plans.In other words, a company may perform poorly despite a favorable business environment if it fails to capitalize on the opportunities due to lack of execution.Let’s See How LRCX, TEL, APH, XLNX and FFIV are PlacedSupplier of wafer fabrication equipment and services, Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report), is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results.

1184,XLNX,"Xilinx Inc. (XLNX  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 24. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this semiconductor company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in to-be-reported quarter. Notably, Xilinx has delivered positive earnings surprises for seven straight quarters.  Over the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average positive surprise of 5.4%. So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 63 cents, which represents a 21.2% increase from the year-ago figure of 52 cents. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the past 60 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $630 million, up 7.6% from the prior-year quarter.We expect field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) products to drive Xilinx's third-quarter sales aided by steady demand in the communications industry, and continued strong adoption of its products in the Automotive and Aerospace and Defense markets.Xilinx, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Xilinx, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Xilinx, Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderXilinx is set to capitalize on the global trend of FPGA replacing application-specified integrated circuits (ASICs). There are certain fundamental advantages of using FPGAs over low-cost ASICs. One of the basic reasons is the difficulty in getting suitable ASICs for design and the additional cost of re-certifying new ASIC-based designs.We expect FPGA products to drive the company’s revenues throughout fiscal 2018, aided by steady demand in the communications industry, and continued strong adoption of its products in Automotive, ISM, Test and Aerospace and Defense markets. Moreover, design wins from other sectors, such as wired communication, data center and industrial, will stoke revenue growth.Furthermore, FPGAs are widely used in third generation (3G) and fourth generation long-term evolution (4G LTE) network connections. These markets are strongly co-related with global GDP growth and spending behavior.Most of the emerging economies are witnessing unprecedented demand for mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, and are also getting increasingly connected via the Internet. This has compelled these countries to heavily invest in the Telecom & Wireless infrastructure. We believe higher wireless deployments across the world will lead to heightened demand for Xilinx’s 28-nm, 20-nm and 16-nm nodes, thereby positively impacting its overall fiscal third-quarter results.Nonetheless, flaring up operating expenses related to tape-outs is likely to weigh on the to-be-reported quarter’s profitability. In addition, management’s pessimistic view over business conditions in India and China, two of its fastest growing markets, remains a concern.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Xilinx is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components.

1186,XLNX,"Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) recently stated its plans to acquire eASIC. Santa Clara, CA-based eASIC is a small company which specializes in customized chip-making technology and has a experience of 19 years in the field. The financial terms were reportedly almost insignificant to the tech giant to be disclosed.Custom-made chips are more efficient but cannot be modified for other purposes. Intel’s move to acquire eASIC holds promise in the long haul considering its ambitions of creating a unique and new technology which takes into account both efficiency and flexibility.Post acquisition, eASIC team will join the chipmaker’s Programmable Solutions Group (“PSG”). eASIC’s structured ASICs (application-specific integrated circuit) microchips will add considerable depth to Intel’s programmable solutions portfolio. Improving time-to-market, advanced features and improved performance will be the other positives.Intel’s notable economies of scale will enable it to gain an edge in terms of cost, power and extended product life cycles of its offerings.The acquisition is expected to conclude in the third quarter of 2018, after clearing the customary regulations.Notably, Intel’s stock has returned 54.9% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s rally of 52.1%. Intel’s bid to enable customers unlock the power of data is a key catalyst.Is the Addition of eASIC to PSG Division a Masterstroke?The customers are increasingly handling workloads either over the cloud, Internet of Things (“IoT”), 4G/5G wireless networks, among other emerging platforms. This calls for designing power constrained and high performance applications solutions which customized ASICs offer.Moreover, robust adoption of FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays) is eventually easing the migration to structured ASICs. Considering the rapid shift to structured ASICs, the company also targets to offer a cost-effective solution that automates the conversion process.In the longer haul, Intel aims to develop advanced programmable chips which “no one on the marketplace” offers. The new class of chips will leverage the company’s Embedded Multi-Die Interconnect Bridge (“EMIB”) technology. The new chips will combine Intel’s FPGAs with eASIC’s structured ASICs in a system to be offered as a package solution.PSG Segment AnalysisPSG accounted for 3.1% of total revenues in first-quarter 2018. PSG unit started with the $16.5 billion Altera acquisition which the company completed in 2015. The segment reported growth of 17.2% from the year-ago quarter to reach $498 million. Strength in data center and embedded products drove top-line growth.Further, PSG's data center segment soared 150% from the year-ago quarter. Management stated that revenues from advanced FPGA products (28, 20 and 14-nm) grew 40% from the year-ago quarter.Altera & eASIC Aids Intel Up the Ante Against XilinixAfter acquiring Altera, Intel has been developing high-end high-performance next-generation 14 nm FPGA chips by using its 14 nm trigate transistor technology. Altera also provides Intel a strategic advantage over Xilinx (XLNX  -  Free Report) regarding its HardCopy offering (a new type of high performance ASIC).The impending new development raises the bar, providing the tech giant a significant edge in the space. Customer base continues to expand as PSG wins more customer designs. Notably, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) has selected Intel's FPGAs to power new Bing intelligent search features using real-time Artificial Intelligence (“AI”).With the eASIC buyout, Intel will bolster PSG capabilities significantly. The new offerings will provide it a further edge over Xilinix, going forward.ConclusionIn a bid to enhance experience of the clients leveraging critical cloud, edge applications, Intel is aspiring to move beyond providing CPUs. Exploring new end-markets will help the company expand its total addressable market (“TAM”).The buyout highlights the ongoing consolidation in the chip industry. The smaller players bereft of economies of scale resort to being acquired by the big names, as it expands their exposure considerably. We believe the combined technologies complement each other. This deal is a win-win situation for both the parties.While Broadcom’s recent proposal to buy CA left a major chunk of analysts confused, Intel’s merger with eASIC has clarity and makes sense. The company’s move is encouraging and augurs well for the future.Zacks Rank & Other PickIntel sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Screen Holdings Co., Ltd (DINRF  -  Free Report) is another stock in the same space, worth considering. It carries the same rank as Intel. The long term earnings of Screen Holdings is pegged at 10%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

1187,XLNX,"Xilinx Inc. (XLNX  -  Free Report) has been gaining on a steady demand in the communications industry, and continued adoption of its products in Automotive, ISM, Test and Aerospace and Defense markets.Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the four trailing quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 6.9%.With expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 9.3% and a current market cap of $16.8 billion, it seems to be a stock that investors should retain in their portfolio right now.Let’s take a look at the factors aiding the company’s performance.Xilinx, a designer and manufacturer of a broad range of high-performance, high-density programmable logic devices (PLDs), is witnessing impressive growth of its 16-nm, 20-nm and 28-nm products.The company’s ongoing transition from a FPGA provider to an all-programmable devices producer has been helping the company gain market share. This is also helping Xilinx counter the stiff competition from the likes of Intel (INTC  -  Free Report).Moreover, the increasing demand for the company’s Ultrascale+ FPGAs from data-center operators for providing FPGA-as-a-Service looks promising, with the client base already having prominent names like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report).We believe Xilinx is poised to tap the opportunities stemming from an increase in adoption of AI technologies, 5G connectivity, autonomous vehicles and IoTs, which will drive  its revenue growth over the long run.Xilinx, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Xilinx, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Xilinx, Inc. QuoteHowever, the company is plagued with certain headwinds in one of its largest markets — the Asia Pacific having sluggish wireless deployments. This, in turn, might be a drag on the company’s near-term results.Additionally, intensifying competition from Intel is a negative for Xilinx. Notably, Intel has become an even stronger competitor after the acquisition of Altera in 2015 and made it difficult for Xilinx to gambit the duo’s combined initiatives.Moreover, Xilinx keeps on innovating for producing advanced FPGAs of lower geometries to improve performance, density and system-level functionality, integration, and lower cost and power consumption at each manufacturing process node. With each transition to a new process node, there are considerable tape-out costs, the need to navigate the learning curve and limited volume production, which are all significant headwinds for margins and profitability.Nevertheless, a favorable product mix, along with a satisfactory guidance for first-quarter fiscal 2019, keeps us hopeful about this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock’s retention in investors’ portfolio.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All                 Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

Shares have added about 8.1% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is XLNX due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Xilinx’s Q4 Earnings & Revenue Beat Estimates, Guides WellXilinx reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 GAAP earnings of 64 cents per share, marking year-over year growth of 12.3%. Excluding the unusual one-time cost related to executive transition, earnings per share came in at 77 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at 66 cents.Revenues for the quarter came in at $672.9 million, which is above the mid-point of its guided range of $635-$665 million (mid-point $650 million). The revenue figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $650 million as well.Advanced Products Drive Top-Line GrowthManagement noted that Xilinx’s revenues recorded growth for the 10th consecutive quarter, reflecting product strength. This uptick was primarily driven by robust performance of the company’s 16nm, 20nm and 28nm products.Product wise, Advanced product revenues jumped 28% year over year and 7% sequentially. We note that the segment’s contribution to total revenues was 57%, a significant increase from 49% in the year-ago quarter and 56% reported in the previous quarter.The robust performance of Advanced products was chiefly driven by solid demand for its Zynq SoC platform, and 20-nm and 16-nm nodes.

However, excluding the unusual one-time cost related to executive transition, operating expenses came in at $252.4 million, lower than management’s expectations of $255 million. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses (excluding the unusual one-time cost related to executive transition) amounted to 37.5%, reflecting 360-bps contraction, on a year-over-year basis.Reduced operating expenses (excluding the unusual one-time cost related to executive transition) as a percentage of revenues, along with healthy revenue growth and improved gross margin, resulted in year-over-year expansion of 470 bps in operating margin, which came in at 33.2%. Additionally, we note that the company registered more than 30% of operating margin for the second consecutive quarter.In dollars, the company posted operating income of $189.8 million, up 9.4% year over year. Excluding the unusual one-time cost related to executive transition, operating income was up 28.7% year over year to $223.1 million.Balance Sheet, Cash Flow & Shareholders’ ReturnXilinx exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $3.45 billion compared with $3.54 billion recorded in the previous quarter. The company has total long-term debt (excluding current portion) of about $1.21 billion, down from $1.73 billion reported in the previous quarter.Xilinx generated cash of $217.7 million from operations and incurred $21 million as capital expenditure during the fiscal fourth quarter. The company paid $89.3 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares for $163.4 million.In fiscal 2018, the company generated cash of $795.5 million from operations and incurred $49.9 million as capital expenditure. It paid $353.1 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 6.9 million shares for $474.3 million.GuidanceFor first-quarter fiscal 2019, Xilinx projects revenues in the range of $660-$690 million (mid-point $675 million). The mid-point of the company’s guided range is currently higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $664.7 million.Management predicts the Advanced Products segment to record growth. Xilinx anticipates the Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive end markets to improve year over year. On the other hand, the communication and data-center end market is estimated to register year-over-year decline.Gross margin is expected between 69% and 71%. Operating expenses are projected at $260 million. Tax rate is estimated between 10% and 14%.Our TakeXilinx is set to capitalize on the global trend of the FPGA replacing application-specified integrated circuits (ASICs). There are certain fundamental advantages of using FPGAs over low-cost ASICs. One of the basic reasons is the difficulty in getting suitable ASICs for design and the additional cost of re-certifying new ASIC-based designs.We expect FPGA products to drive the company’s revenues throughout fiscal 2019, aided by steady demand in the communications industry, and continued strong adoption of its products in Automotive, ISM, Test and Aerospace and Defense markets. Moreover, design wins from other sectors, such as wired communication, data center and industrial, will stoke revenue growth.Furthermore, FPGAs are widely used in third generation (3G) and fourth generation long-term evolution (4G LTE) network connections. These markets are strongly co-related with global GDP growth and spending behavior.Most of the emerging economies are witnessing unprecedented demand for mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, and also getting increasingly connected via the Internet. This has compelled these countries to heavily invest in the Telecom & Wireless infrastructure. We believe higher wireless deployments across the world will spur demand for Xilinx’s 16-nm, 20-nm and 28-nm nodes, thereby positively influencing its overall financial performance for the next few quarters.Currently, Xilinx carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1191,XLNX,"The Q1 earnings cycle is in full swing, with a number of semiconductor companies slated to report their quarterly numbers over the next few days. The industry serves as a driver, enabler and indicator of technological progress.According to the Earnings Preview dated Apr 20, technology, along with the finance sector, will bring in more than 40% of the S&P 500 index’s total earnings this year. Per the report, Q1 total earnings for the tech sector are projected to be up 20.9% on 11.5% higher revenues.We note that the technology sector has been a robust performer for the past year. This sector has been benefiting from the increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.We believe the aforementioned emerging trends have provided some much-needed opportunity to semiconductor companies to counter the loss of business due to the declining PC market which still consumes bulk of chips. Notably, according to the latest report of World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS), semiconductor revenues climbed 20.6% year over year to $408.7 billion in 2017.It is expected that the semiconductor industry will continue to record growth this year as well, although not as high as 2017, but still at a decent rate. Per the WSTS report, semiconductor revenues are likely to touch $437.3 billion in 2018, representing growth of 7.7%.The industry is poised to benefit from the rising demand driven by the aforementioned trends in technologies, deployment push of 5G-broadband technology across the globe and President Trump’s pro-business policies, including tax cuts, deregulation and outlays on infrastructure.However, this does not ensure earnings beat for all companies in the space. It should be noted that a company’s earnings outperformance is dependent on the overall business environment, as well as management’s ability to implement operating and strategic plans.In other words, a company may perform dismally despite a favorable business environment if it fails to capitalize on the opportunities due to lack of execution.Notably, our research shows that when a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) stock is combined with a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of beating earnings estimates is high. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Let’s see what’s in store for these semiconductor stocks, all of which are expected to release quarterly figures tomorrow.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and revenues is pegged at 9 cents and $1.55 billion, respectively. In the year-ago quarter, the company reported a loss per share of 4 cents and revenues of $984 million. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.96%.Increasing adoption of AI techniques and machine-learning tools in industries like gaming, automotive and blockchain is primarily responsible for spurring GPU demand. The company continues to benefit from the robust performance of its product portfolio, comprising Ryzen CPU, EPYC and Radeon Vega GPUs.Additionally, collaborations with the likes of Baidu (BIDU  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Tencent, Microsoft and JD.com are other positives for the company. (Read more: Advanced Micro Q1 Earnings: Is a Beat in the Cards?)Another semiconductor company, Cavium, Inc. , is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results. The company offers software compatible processors that enable functionality in data-center applications, and network connectivity for server and switches. It should be noted that the company has entered into a definitive agreement to get acquired by Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL).The stock carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of +6.04%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at 75 cents, indicating a 29.3% year-over-year increase. Revenues are estimated to be around $260 million, reflecting a 13.3% increase from the year-earlier quarter. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Let’s take a sneak peek at Xilinx, Inc. (XLNX  -  Free Report) which is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 figures. The rising demand for Xilinx’s high-performance, high-density programmable logic devices will likely prove beneficial for the company’s top line. We believe Xilinx is well positioned to tap the opportunities stemming from growth in adoption of AI technologies, 5G connectivity, autonomous vehicles and IoTs.Also, Xilinx’s ongoing transition from a FPGA provider to an all-programmable devices producer has been helping the company gain market share. Its expanding product portfolio, which includes the Zynq RFSoC platform, is assisting it to counter intense competition from the likes of Intel. Read more: Is a Beat in the Cards for Xilinx in Q4 Earnings?)The stock carries a Zacks Rank of 2 and has an Earnings ESP of -0.19%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 66 cents, indicating a 15.8% increase on a year-over-year basis. Revenues are estimated to be around $649.5 million, reflecting a 6.6% rise from the year-ago quarter.Lastly, Silicon Laboratories Inc. (SLAB  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter numbers. The company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 76 cents for the first quarter depicts 20.6% growth from the prior-year quarter. The Consensus Estimate for the company’s revenues is pegged at $199.7 million for the quarter under review, up 11.5% from first-quarter 2017.Analysts covering the stock believe the company will benefit from increasing demand for its IoT products across the automotive, industrial and consumer end markets. Nevertheless, stiff competition from NXP Semiconductors and Texas Instruments is a major headwind.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

Management expects data-centric part of the business to grow in the mid-teens range, while PC centric to decline in low-single digits.Apart from strong on-going demand for public clouds, the company is also expected to benefit from strength in on-premise and hybrid cloud build-outs.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Data Center Group (“DCG”) currently stands at $4.82 billion higher than $4.23 billion in the year-ago quarter.Intel’s data center business and cloud have been registering strong growth in the last few quarters. The company has made significant advancement in this area as well and it is now offering more integrated solutions that are likely to be competitive on a cost per watt basis.The company’s investments in field programmable gate array (FPGA) for acceleration (dramatically increases performances at very low power) and memory to reduce latency and increase speeds are helping it develop custom solutions for big players.Moreover, Intel’s acquisition of MobilEye now enables it to offer almost anything related to self-driving vehicles — cameras, in-car networking, sensor-chips, roadway mapping, cloud software, machine learning and data management. The buyout enables the company rapidly penetrate the autonomous car technology market, currently dominated by the likes of NVIDIA.Intel has also been a long-time supplier to Alphabet’s Waymo division. Further, its partnerships with BMW, Nissan, Volkswagen AG, and Ferrari will boost sales of processing chips, sensor-chips, cloud software and many more, are expected to drive top-line growth in the soon-to-be reported quarter.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has a good chance of beating estimates. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.Intel has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -1.21%, which indicates an unlikely positive surprise.

1193,XLNX,"Viacom (VIAB  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 25.Earlier this month, CBS Corp (CBS) offered a below market bid for Viacom, which was immediately rejected. The CBS offer of 0.55 shares for each Viacom class B share failed to impress the owner of Nickelodeon and MTV networks.The company believes a market price of 0.62 is suitable. Notably, it expects cost synergy of $1 billion from the merger.Notably, Viacom beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 11.09%. In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents. Viacom Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Viacom Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Viacom Inc. Quote Viacom’s top-line has also beaten the consensus mark in three of the trailing four quarters. In the last quarter, revenues came in at $3.07 billion, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.14 billion and decreased 7.6% from the year-ago quarter.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderShares of Viacom have lost 0.4% on a year-to-date basis as compared with the industry’s decline of 2.5%. The decline can be attributed to the ongoing scuffle over the merger with CBS.  Moreover, growth projections are muted. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings of 80 cents per share represents a year-over-year increase of 1.3%. However, the consensus sales expectations for the second quarter stand at $3.03 billion, representing year-over-year decline of 6.91%.Viacom is likely to be hurt by weak affiliate revenues in the United States owing to loss of subscribers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter fiscal 2018 affiliate revenues is pegged at $1.14 billion, unchanged on a year-over-year basis.Moreover, management expects domestic ad revenues to improve sequentially in the second quarter. Ratings improvement, new original programming content, greater carriage benefits from improved distributor penetration and higher contribution from digital initiatives are key catalysts.However, the company’s performance on the international front is anticipated to be much better driven by expanding market share in Latin America and India.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has a good chance of beating estimates.

In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents.Moreover, Comcast’s top-line has beaten the consensus mark in three of the trailing four quarters. In the last-quarter, revenues came in at $21.92 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.80 billion and increased 4.2% from the year-ago quarter.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderComcast has completed the nationwide rollout of its wireless services under the Xfinity Mobile brand. Based on a Mobile Virtual Network Operator agreement with Verizon, Xfinity Mobile uses Verizon's 4G LTE wireless network. Comcast Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Comcast Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Comcast Corporation Quote Comcast continues to add new features like the voice remote (more than 20 million currently deployed) and has integrated YouTube, Pandora and iHeartRadio. These features are likely to improve customer engagement, consequently benefiting top-line growth.Moreover, the company continues to roll out xFi pod extenders to increased Wi-Fi coverage in the home and its xFi app, which offers an unrivaled level of control. Increasing demand for high-speed internet presents significant growth opportunity for Comcast. The company’s broadband penetration currently stands at 45%.Business Services have been witnessing strong momentum and continue to present attractive growth prospects. Comcast has started deploying fiber-based 2 Gbps residential broadband Internet services in certain regions. Known as Gigabit Pro, this new service runs on FTTH technology.Comcast Business has also announced the launch of DOCSIS 3.1-based internet service to business customers.Moreover, Comcast’s strategy of consistent investment in new attractions at the company’s theme parks is expected to drive growth for NBCUniversal in the to-be-reported quarter.However, we remain concerned about the company’s operation in a saturated and competitive multi-channel U.S. video market. Comcast lost 33,000 video customers and 13,000 voice customers in the fourth-quarter 2017, due to cord-cutting and stiff competition.Additionally, we view the company's high-debt levels and consolidation-related woes as potential hazards.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has a good chance of beating estimates.

Demand continues to be strong in automotive, industrial and military markets.However, management expects sales in the military market to moderate from fourth-quarter level (up 11% year-over-year).Moreover, Amphenol remains encouraged by expanding presence in the fast-growing commercial aerospace market. The company is well positioned to capitalize on the proliferation of electronics content in next-generation planes. These advanced electronic systems require new advanced technology interconnect solutions to enhance fuel efficiency and improve passenger experience, all of which create excellent opportunities for the company.Nevertheless, sales in the commercial aerospace market is expected moderate (low single digit growth against 11% in the fourth-quarter) as helicopter and business jet procurement volume stabilize and as commercial jetliner production continues to grow moderately.Further, the latest acquisition of Canada-based CTI Industries that manufactures high technology cable assemblies diversifies Ampehenol’s interconnect product portfolio, which will drive industrial market top-line growth. However, sales in the industrial market are also expected to moderate in the first quarter.Automotive Growth to ContinueAutomotive growth is anticipated to be sustained by a robust product portfolio.

In the trailing four quarters, the company’s results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice, came in line in another and missed in the other. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 5.2%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that F5 Networks is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it possesses the two key components.

The company enjoys a strong foothold in the Layer 4-7 content switching market.Furthermore, during the fiscal first-quarter conference call, F5 Networks’ management was optimistic about the deployment of solutions by customers on cloud and on-premise environment, which is expected to drive near-term revenues.Additionally, the company is also taking steps to address the rising need of multi-cloud environment and better scaling of applications in an era where organizations are taking up digital transformation at an accelerated pace. To meet the requirement of the “per application based cloud decision” of companies, F5 Networks came up with per application VE solutions in the fiscal first quarter. These offerings are meant to support web-application firewall and management of traffic.

This uptick was primarily driven by robust performance of the company’s 16nm, 20nm and 28nm products.Product wise, Advanced product revenues jumped a whopping 21% year over year and 1% sequentially. We note that the segment’s contribution to total revenues was 52%, a significant increase from 46% in the year-ago quarter. However, the contribution remained flat when compared with the previous quarter.The robust performance of Advanced products was mainly driven by strong demand for its Zynq SoC platform and 20-nm and 16-nm nodes. Revenues from the Zynq SoC platform recorded 65% year-over-year growth and contributed 12% to total revenues, backed by robust demand in wireless, primarily for pre-5G deployments.The 20-nm sales were up 40% year over year in the reported quarter, chiefly driven by strength in multiple end markets.However, Xilinx noted that the 16-nm was the top performer in the quarter, registering a four-fold jump in revenues. The company shipped 34 unique products to more than 930 discrete customers across all end markets.Revenues from core products declined 5% from the year-ago quarter, however inched up 1% sequentially.On the basis of the End Market, Communications & Data Center segment revenues (37% of total revenue) dipped 5% year over year and 10% sequentially. The industrial, Aerospace & Defense segment revenues (45% of total revenue) climbed 17% on a year-over-year basis and 7% on a sequential basis. The broadcast, Consumer & Automotive revenues (18% of total revenue) ascended 12% year over year and 11% sequentially.Geographically, the company registered year-over-year growth in every region. Revenues from Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe and North America were up 14%, 12%, 4% and 1%, respectively. Nevertheless, sequentially, Asia Pacific was weak, declining 7%. This was fully offset by robust growth from North America, Japan and Europe, which advanced 8%, 8% and 2%, respectively.Product Strength: Key CatalystXilinx’s ongoing transition from a FPGA provider to an all-programmable devices producer is helping the company gain market share. The company’s expanding product portfolio, which includes the Zynq RFSoC platform, is assisting it to counter intense competition from the likes of Intel (INTC  -  Free Report). The company’s Zynq portfolio, which is implemented in both the 28-nm and 16-nm node, delivered sturdy top-line growth in the quarter.Xilinx noted that it had started shipping of the 16-nm RFSoC Silicon In-house family of product in the second quarter, which offers a superior architectural solution to 5G wireless with integrated RF-class analog technology. The product facilitates the reduction of power consumption (50-75%), as well as footprint reduction for future 5G deployments, cable and wireless backhaul applications.Management is also optimistic over the demand of Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) FPGA-as-a-Service (the cloud service is supported by Xilinx’s Ultrascale+ FPGAs) that targets the traditional hardware FPGA designers. Xilinx believes Amazon’s deployment of SDAccel and SDSoC products will fortify its competitive position against other SoC providers.Operational DetailsGross margin expanded 60 basis points (bps) year over year to 70.2% and 140 bps sequentially, and was within the company’s guided range of 69-71%.Operating expenses flared up 10.2% year over year and 2.7% sequentially to $249.8 million. Nonetheless, the figure came in $3.2 million lower than the company’s guidance. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses amounted to 40.3%, reflecting an increase of 120 bps on a year-over-year basis and 80 bps sequentially.Escalating operating expenses as a percentage of revenues more than offset the benefit of healthy revenue growth and improved gross margin, resulting in year-over-year contraction of 60 bps in operating margin which came in at 29.9%. Nonetheless, on a sequential basis, operating margin improved 60 bps mainly driven by higher gross margin.In dollars, the company posted operating income of $185.2 million, up 4.7% year over year and 2.6% sequentially.Balance Sheet, Cash Flow & Shareholders’ ReturnXilinx exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $3.56 billion compared with $3.65 billion recorded in the previous quarter. The company has total long-term debt (excluding current portion) of about $1.74 billion, flat from the end of the previous quarter.Xilinx generated cash of $202.1 million from operations and incurred $12.2 million as capital expenditure during the second quarter. The company paid $87 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares for $170.5 million.In the first half of fiscal 2018, the company generated cash of $393.1 million from operations and incurred $22.1 million as capital expenditure. It paid $174.3 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 3.6 million shares for $237.5 million.GuidanceFor third-quarter fiscal 2018, Xilinx projects revenues in the range $615-$645 million (mid-point $630 million). The mid-point of the company’s guidance range is currently higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $626.5 million.Management continues to expect growth in the Advanced Products segment. Xilinx anticipates the Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive end market to register a decline, while Communications will likely remain flat year over year. On the other hand, the Industrial, Aerospace & Defense end market is projected to witness growth.Gross margin is anticipated to be between 69% and 71%. Operating expenses are likely to increase to $260 million, mainly due to higher research & development (R&D) expenses. Tax rate is projected between 11% and 14%.The company remains focused on achieving its fiscal 2018 revenue target of approximately $2.5 billion. Xilinx also expects to deliver more than 30% of operating margin exiting this fiscal year.Our TakeWe believe the rising demand for 28-nm, 20-nm and 16-nm nodes is a positive for the company. Also, a favorable product mix (higher Industrial, lower wireless) will help in gross-margin expansion in the near term.Xilinx’s expanding software defined programming portfolio, along with hardware solutions, to accelerate machine learning is anticipated to drive user base. The company has significant growth opportunities in Data center, 5G deployment, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Industrial IoT and Advanced Driver Assisted Systems (ADAS) applications over the long haul.However, growth from wireless is expected to remain volatile until 2020, which is a concern. Escalating operating expenses related to tape-outs might weigh on the company’s profitability in the near future.In addition to this, management’s pessimistic view over business conditions in India and China, two of its fastest growing markets, is another grave concern.Currently, Xilinx has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Long-term expected EPS growth rate for NVIDIA is 11.2%.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1198,XLNX,"The Q3 earnings cycle in full swing with a number of semiconductor companies slated to report the quarterly numbers over the next few days. The industry serves as a driver, enabler and indicator of technological progress.According to the latest Earnings Preview, technology is one of the four sectors that is anticipated to report strong earnings growth in the third quarter. The other three are Oil/Energy, Industrial Products and Construction. Various technology giants, including Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), are scheduled to report quarterly numbers this week. Per the report, total earnings for the tech sector are projected to be up 9.9% on 7.1% higher revenues.We note that the technology sector has been an impressive performer on a year-to-date basis. The sector is benefiting from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.We believe the aforementioned emerging trends have provided some much-needed opportunity to semiconductor companies to counter the loss of business due to the declining PC market which still consumes bulk of chips.However, this does not ensure earnings beat for all companies in the space. It should be noted that a company’s earnings outperformance is dependent on the overall business environment as well as management’s ability to implement operating and strategic plans.In other words, a company may perform dismally despite a favorable business environment if it fails to capitalize on the opportunities due to lack of execution.Notably, our research shows that when a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) stock is combined with a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of beating earnings estimates is high. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Let’s see what’s in store for these semiconductor stocks, all of which are expected to release quarterly numbers tomorrow.Xilinx Inc. (XLNX  -  Free Report), which will report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, is set to capitalize on the global trend of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) replacing application-specified integrated circuits (ASICs). We expect FPGA products to drive the company’s revenues throughout fiscal 2018, aided by steady demand in communications industry, and continued strong adoption of its products in the Automotive, ISM, Test and Aerospace and Defense markets. Moreover, design wins from other sectors such as wired communication, data center and industrial will add to revenues. (Read: Key Factors Likely to Drive Xilinx's Q2 Earnings)Notably, the company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 7.4% in the trailing four quarters.

Price and EPS Surprise | Xilinx, Inc. QuoteFurther, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents for the fiscal second quarter has remained unchanged in the last 30 days. The Consensus Estimate for the company’s revenues is pegged at $620.4 million for the to-be-reported quarter, up 7.1% from second-quarter fiscal 2017.Let’s take a sneak peek at NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI  -  Free Report), which is set to report third-quarter 2017 results. Continued strong adoption of tablets and smartphones, automotive electronics, and the emergence of the new category of wearables have been boosting the demand for processing and sensing devices that run them. We believe this should benefit NXP Semiconductor’s third-quarter revenues. Nonetheless, macroeconomic weakness, competition from Xilinx and Lattice Semiconductor Corp., consolidation in the telecom market and declining margins remain headwinds. (Read: NXP Semiconductors Q3 Earnings: What's in Store?)NXP Semiconductors has an Earnings ESP of -1.18% and carries a Zacks Rank #3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.04 for the third quarter remained unchanged in a month’s time.

(SLAB  -  Free Report), a global fabless semiconductor company involved in designing, developing and marketing mixed-signal analog intensive integrated circuits (ICs), will report third-quarter 2017 results. Analysts covering the stock believe the company will benefit from increasing demand for its IoT products across the automotive, industrial and consumer end markets. Nevertheless, stiff competition from NXP Semiconductors and Texas Instruments is a major headwind.Silicon Laboratories has an Earnings ESP of -0.49% and carries a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents for the third quarter remained unchanged in a month’s time. The Consensus Estimate for the company’s revenues is pegged at $196.2 million for the quarter under review, up 10.2% from third-quarter 2016.Silicon Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Silicon Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Silicon Laboratories, Inc. QuoteLastly, Mellanox Technologies Inc. (MLNX  -  Free Report) will report third-quarter 2017 results. The exponential growth in data bodes well for Mellanox’s interconnect solutions owing to growing demand for higher network speeds for fast processing of data. In addition to this, collaborations with the likes of VMware and Hewlett Packard Enterprises have helped the company gain strong footprint in the cloud and data-center market. All this should support the company’s to-be-reported quarter’s overall performance. Nevertheless, stiff competition from Intel is a major headwind. Although Mellanox haven’t lost any market share (according to management) in the recent quarter, Intel’s aggressive pricing strategy remains a concern, in our view.Mellanox has an Earnings ESP of +1.84% and carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Notably, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 64 cents for the third quarter remained unchanged in a month’s time. The Consensus Estimate for the company’s revenues is pegged at $226.3 million for the quarter to be reported, up 1.1% from the prior-year quarter.Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.

1199,XLNX,"Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 26. The company has witnessed a remarkable streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous four reports. In fact, in each of the trailing four quarters, Western Digital surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with an average positive earnings surprise of 6.4%.Due to expansion in digital data, modest growth of TAM and higher demand for storage, Western Digital’s prospects look bright. Additionally, the company’s expanding product portfolio, secular growth of digital data, growing exposure to the SMB space and positive synergies derived from the SanDisk acquisition are likely to act as catalysts for Q3 results.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Western Digital is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it possesses the two key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Western Digital flaunts a Zacks Rank of 1 and has an Earnings ESP of 2.30%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal third-quarter earnings is pegged at $3.27, indicating an increase of 36.8% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved up by a penny over the past seven days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $4.93 billion, up 6.1% from the year-ago quarter. Western Digital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Western Digital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Western Digital Corporation Quote What’s Behind This Overwhelming Expectation?Western Digital has been expanding in the SSD storage market, bothered by the declining sales in the PC market. The emergence of thinner laptops, tablets and demand for fast processing storage devices over the past few years has created an ideal market for SSDs.Over the last few months, the company rolled out the world’s smallest 1 TB USB flash drive, voice activated media streaming via home devices, and a new series of high performance SSDs. With the rising need to capture and share rich content, lens technology and video streaming are becoming more immersive.For photographers and drone enthusiasts, the company also released My Passport Wireless SSD and SanDisk Extreme portable SSD. These devices feature a one-touch card copy that enables quick editing, as well as third-party app integration.Western Digital also unveiled the My Cloud Home device that displays new voice-activated media streaming features through smart-home devices.These product additions will enhance the company’s existing product portfolio and aid Western Digital in gaining a strong foothold in the global SSD market, which, per the latest data by TechNavio, is expected to witness CAGR of 17% during 2016-2020.Anticipating a potential acceleration in cloud deployments, Western Digital is also investing heavily to deliver high-capacity storage devices which will support expansion of cloud infrastructure and cloud applications.The company has expanded its My Cloud solutions with My Cloud EX4, a broader portfolio of network attached storage (NAS) hard drives. My Cloud EX4 will help the company meet growing business needs, with improved flexibility and security, consequently boosting its top line.The ongoing transformation to 3D NAND technology is another tailwind. Further, the company’s expanding footprint in the automotive, as well as the connected home and industrial categories are likely to act as another key catalyst.Furthermore, Western Digital’s acquisition of SanDisk has aided the company’s growth and helped it gain traction in SSD.  Additionally, it has enabled the company to step into the NAND products market which, owing to its strong demand, will drive revenues.Moreover, the company’s acquisitions of Amplidata, sTec, Inc., Velobit, Inc. Arkeia Software Solutions and Virident Systems Inc. have not only strengthened its small-to-medium sized business solutions but also expanded its SSD product portfolio as well.Some Other Stocks With Favorable CombinationsHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Xilinx, Inc.

1200,XLNX,"Xilinx Inc. (XLNX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 25. Notably, the stock has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 9% in the trailing four quarters. In the last reported quarter, the company came up with a positive earnings surprise of 20.6%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 68 cents per share, indicating a 19.3% increase on a year-over-year basis. Revenues are estimated to be around $649.54 million, indicating a 6.6% increase from the year-ago quarter.Factors to ConsiderThe increasing demand for Xilinx’s high-performance, high-density programmable logic devices will prove to be beneficial for the company’s top line.

1201,XLNX,"Some of the biggest tech names are slated to report earnings this week. These results come at a time when the technology sector is grappling with several crises which have sprung up at short intervals. Of the companies, slated to report earnings this week, Facebook, Inc. (FB) has had to battle the fallout of a data leak scandal. Meanwhile, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) has been the target of several attacks from President Trump.Given this backdrop, investors would be wondering whether upcoming results can help override recent concerns. Fortunately, earnings and revenues from the sector are likely to improve in the first quarter, which makes it a good idea to pick up select tech stocks which are also likely to outperform their earnings estimates.Can Strong Results Outweigh Recent Concerns?The variety of concerns plaguing technology, a sector which largely powered an unprecedented Bull Run, has had the strongest proponents of the sector scurrying for cover. Only recently, poor guidance from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (TSM) pulled down other tech majors like Apple Inc. (AAPL).But not all the worries the sector faces at the moment could snowball into threats of significant proportions. For instance, most market watchers believe that a divided Congress is unlikely to regulate data gathering of the kind practiced by Facebook or Google. Online advertising spends, therefore, are likely to remain largely unchanged.However, higher user engagement will still be topmost on the list of investor priorities. Ultimately, earnings would not only have to be good overall. They would have to be strong enough to outweigh recent sector concerns.Earnings Prospects Remain PromisingUnlike the Finance sector whose earnings performance notably improved this earnings season compared to other recent periods, the Tech sector’s earnings performance has been strong over the last many quarters. This strength is expected to continue in the Q1 earnings season as well.Total Q1 earnings for the Tech sector are expected to be up 20.9% from the same period last year on 11.5% higher revenues. This would follow 24.2% earnings growth for the sector on 11.1% revenue growth in the preceding quarter. (Read: Can Tech Earnings Live Up to Expectations?)That’s head and shoulders above the autos and conglomerate sectors, earnings for which are expected to decline by 9.6% and 1.1%, respectively during the first quarter. Overall, total Q1 earnings are expected to be up 18% from the same period last year on 5.3% higher revenues.Our ChoicesTech stocks have been battered on several fronts this year, the latest being poor guidance from Taiwan Semiconductor. However, several of the concerns surrounding the sector are unlikely to build up into something larger.For instance, U.S. lawmakers are unlikely to impose stringent regulation on tech majors in the near term. Meanwhile, in keeping with stellar fourth-quarter results, first-quarter numbers are likely to be impressive.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising with their next earnings announcement.

1202,XLNX,"Markets closed mostly lower after a decline in tech stocks following a dip in the shares of Apple. Also weighing on broader markets were Wilbur Ross’ and Steve Mnuchin’s comments at Davos. However, the Dow managed to post a record close after assistance from financial stocks. Meanwhile, the existing home sales for December came in below expected.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased less than 0.2%, to close at 26,252.12. The S&P 500 fell almost 0.1% to close at 2,837.54. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,415.06, losing 0.6%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 3.3% to close at 11.47. A total of around 7.63 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, higher than the last 20-session average of 6.53 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.21-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.68-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Dow Manages Gains on a Tough DayEarlier in the session, a surge in industrial stocks boosted the Dow. Shares of industrial behemoths like General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) all shot up. Caterpillar, in particular, gained after it witnessed an increase in its monthly machine retail sales. However, shares of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) declined by as much as 1.6% and weighed heavily on the blue-chip index. Also, comments from U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin weighed on the Dow.Wilbur Ross commented on Wednesday that United States was prepared for a trade war with China if the need arises. Speaking at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Switzerland, Ross stated: “So trade wars have been in place for quite a little while; the difference is the US troops are now coming to the ramparts.” Ross also blamed China for hiding its practice of trade protectionism under the veil of free trade.Even more noteworthy comments were heard from his colleague U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who said the Trump administration favored “bilateral trade agreements.”’ Mnuchin added that any weakness in the dollar was beneficial for trade. His comments led to the ICE U.S. Dollar Index falling below the 90 mark for the first time since Dec 2014.Further, the Trump administration imposed high tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels on Monday. Such protectionist policies weighed on the greenback and broader markets.Finally, the Dow managed to gain 41.3 points and finished at a fresh record. Gains for the blue-chip index were supported by a surge in financial stocks.

1206,XLNX,"Xilinx Inc. (XLNX  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings of 63 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by three cents. The figure increased 2.7% from the year-ago quarter and 9.6% from the previous quarter.The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by higher revenues, while the sequential increase benefited from lower operating expenses despite modest top-line growth.Xilinx reported revenues of approximately $615.4 million, up 7% year over year and 1% quarter over quarter. Revenues were in line with the mid point of the company’s guided revenue range of $600–$630 million. However, the figure lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $616 million.Advanced Products Drives Top lineManagement noted that Xilinx’s revenues have grown for the seventh consecutive quarter reflecting product strength. The growth was primarily driven by robust performance of the company’s 16nm, 20nm, and 28nm products. Management also noted that the expanded partnership with Avnet (AVT  -  Free Report) is benefiting top-line growth. Xilinx, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Xilinx, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Xilinx, Inc. QuoteOn the basis of End Market, Communications & Data Center segment revenues (41% of total revenue) declined 1% year over year, but increased 1% sequentially. Industrial, Aerospace & Defense segment revenues (42% of total revenue) increased 17% on a year-over-year basis but remained flat on a sequential basis. Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive revenues (17% of total revenue) increased 6% year over year and 3% sequentially.Product wise, Advanced products revenues increased a whopping 33% year over year and 8% sequentially. We note that the segment’s contribution to total revenue was 52%, a significant increase from 42% in the year-ago quarter and 49% in the previous quarter.The 28-nm portfolio increased sequentially due to strong demand from ISM, TME, broadcast and consumer market. The 20-nm sales also significantly increased in the quarter, driven by robust demand in wireless, primarily for pre-5G deployments.However, Xilinx noted that the 16-nm was the topmost performer in the quarter. The company shipped 22 unique products to more than 530 discrete customers across all end markets.As expected, revenues from core products declined 12% from the year-ago quarter and 6% sequentially.Geographically, on a year-over-year basis, revenues from Asia Pacific, Japan and Europe increased 16%, 9% and 9%, respectively. On the other hand, revenues from North America declined 6%.Sequentially, North America was weak, declining 7%. This was fully offset by robust growth from Asia Pacific, Japan and Europe, which increased 5%, 12% and 1%, respectively.Product Strength: Key CatalystXilinx’s ongoing transition from a FPGA provider to an all programmable devices producer is helping it to gain market share. The company’s expanding product portfolio, which includes the Zynq RFSoC platform, is aiding it against intense competition from the likes of Intel (INTC  -  Free Report).  Zynq portfolio, which is implemented in both the 28-nm and 16-nm node, delivered strong top-line growth in the quarter.Xilinx stated that it has started sampling of the 16-nm RFSoC Silicon In-house family of product, which offers a superior architectural solution to 5G wireless with integrated RF-class analog technology. The product helps in reducing power consumption (50% to 75%) and footprint reduction for future 5G deployments, cable and wireless backhaul applications.Management is also optimistic over the demand of Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) FPGA-as-a-Service (the cloud service is supported by Xilinx’s Ultrascale+ FPGAs) that targets the traditional hardware FPGA designers. Xilinx believes that Amazon’s deployment of SDAccel and SDSoC products will boost its competitive position against other SoC providers.Operational DetailsGross margin contracted 190 basis points (bps) year over year to 68.8% and was within the company’s guided range of 68–70%. Sequentially, gross margin contracted 70 bps.Operating expenses increased 10.5% year over year but declined 2.7% to $242.3 million. The figure was almost $3 million higher than the company’s guidance. This was because Xilinx accelerated some 16-nm tape-out expenses to extend its technology leadership and add some increased litigation expense.Moreover, as a percentage of revenues, operating expenses amounted to 39.4%, reflecting a 130 bps year-over-year increase. But sequentially, operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, fell 150 bps.As a result, operating income declined 3.5% year over year but increased 3.7% quarter over quarter to $181 million. Additionally, operating margin contracted 320 bps due to lower gross margin base as well as higher operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues. Sequentially, operating margin expanded 80 bps.Balance Sheet, Cash Flow & Shareholders’ ReturnXilinx exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $3.65 billion compared with $3.32 billion in the previous quarter. The company has total long-term debt (excluding current portion) of about $1.74 billion up from $995.2 million at the end of the previous quarter.During the quarter, Xilinx raised $750 million of fixed rate debt at a rate of 2.95% with a seven-year term.Xilinx generated cash of $191 million from operations and incurred $10 million as capital expenditure. The company paid $82 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 1 million shares for $67 million.GuidanceFor second-quarter fiscal 2018, Xilinx expects revenues in a range $605–$635 million. (mid-point $620 million). The mid-point of the company’s guidance range of $620 million is currently higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $617.7 million.Management continues to expect growth in Advanced Products segment. Xilings expects the communications end-market to decline primarily due to weakness in wireless. Industrial, Aerospace & Defense and Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive are expected to increase.Gross margin is anticipated to be between 69% and 71%. Operating expenses are likely to be around $253 million, higher than expected due to increasing research & development (R&D) expenses related to tape-outs. Tax rate is projected between 10% and 14%.The company remains focused on achieving the fiscal 2018 revenue target of approximately $2.5 billion. Xilinx also expects to deliver more than 30% of operating margin exiting this fiscal year.Our TakeWe believe that rising demand for 28-nm, 20-nm and 16-nm nodes is positive for the company. Moreover, favorable product mix (higher Industrial, lower wireless) will help in gross margin expansion in the current quarter.Xilinx’s expanding software defined programming portfolio along with hardware solutions to accelerate machine learning is expected to drive user base. The company has significant growth opportunities in Data center, 5G deployment, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Industrial IoT and Advanced Driver Assisted Systems (ADAS) applications over the long haul.However, growth from wireless is expected to remain volatile until 2020, which is a concern. Increasing operating expenses related to tape-outs will weigh on profitability in the near term.Moreover, management’s pessimistic view over business conditions in India and China, two of its fastest growing markets, poses strong headwinds.Currently, Xilinx has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

(Read More)Trump Keeps Investors on TenterhooksAmidst much speculation regarding who will go on to head the Fed, investors eagerly wait for President Trump’s decision to choose Janet Yellen’s successor, post the expiration of her term as the Fed Chief in February, 2018. In a surprising move, Trump sought help of the Senate Republicans on Tuesday to zero in on a potential candidate for the post of Fed Chief. In a show-of-hands, Senators from the GOP unanimously vouched for Stanford University Professor John Taylor to be the next Chief of Fed. Trump would reportedly announce the name of Yellen’s successor officially before he heads out on a trip to Asia. Some experts commented that ‘show-of-hands’ might possibly be a decisive factor affecting Trump’s decision.Meanwhile, broader markets gained from positive investor sentiment due to hopes that the existing tax code would soon be amended. The green signal to the budget blueprint ensures taxpayers that existing tax codes would be rewritten, more so because it has unlocked a procedure using which President Trump and his team can push through their tax reforms using only Republican votes.Economic DataOn the economic data front, new home sales surged to 667,000 in September, up from 561,000 in August — an increase of 18.9% from the previous figure.

1212,XLNX,"Xilinx Inc.’s (XLNX  -  Free Report) shares have added about 3% in yesterday’s trading session, outperforming the market.In the year-to-date period, its shares have advanced 10.9%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 7.7%.Before we discuss how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent fundamentals and trends in order to get a better understanding of the important drivers.Growth DriversXilinx’s ongoing transition from FPGA provider to an all programmable devices producer is helping it gain market share. The company’s expanding product portfolio, which includes the Zynq RFSoC platform, is aiding it against intense competition from the likes of Intel (INTC).  Zynq portfolio, which is implemented in both the 28-nm and 16-nm node, is growth catalyst.The company also started sampling of the 16-nm RFSoC Silicon In-house family of product, which offers a superior architectural solution to 5G wireless with integrated RF-class analog technology. The product helps in reducing power consumption (50% to 75%) and footprint reduction for future 5G deployments, cable and wireless backhaul applications.Further, management is optimistic over the demand of Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) FPGA-as-a-Service (the cloud service is supported by Xilinx’s Ultrascale+ FPGAs) that targets the traditional hardware FPGA designers. Xilinx believes that Amazon’s deployment of SDAccel and SDSoC products will boost competitive position against other SoC providers.Most recently, the company announced that its software defined development environment, SDAccel, is now available on Amazon Web Services (AWS) for use with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) F1 instances.We believe that rising demand for 28-nm, 20-nm and 16-nm nodes is positive for the company.Xilinx’s expanding software defined programming portfolio along with hardware solutions to accelerate machine learning is expected to drive user base. The company has significant growth opportunities in Data center, 5G deployment, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Industrial IoT and Advanced Driver Assisted Systems (ADAS) applications over the long haul.Upward Estimate RevisionsIn the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Xilinx’s current quarter and current year witnessed upward revisions. For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at 62 cents, up from earnings of 61 cents earlier. Similarly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year is currently pegged at $2.55 per share compared with $2.50 projected 60 days ago.Style Scores Look GreatXilinx currently sports an A grade for Growth, lifting its overall VGM Score to B.ConclusionThe stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Additionally, the stock has long-term earnings per share growth rate of 9.3%. Notably, the company has posted a positive earnings surprise in the last four quarters with an average beat of 7.4%.In our opinion, the stock deserves a place in investor’s portfolio and we are expecting an impressive return from the stock in the next few months.A few better-ranked stocks worth considering are Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), both sporting s a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Long-term expected EPS growth rate for Applied Materials and NVIDIA is 17.1% and 10.3%, respectively.5 Trades Could Profit """"Big-League"""" from Trump Policies If the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>

1214,XLNX,"Xilinx Inc. (XLNX  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Jul 26. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 5.56%. Notably, Xilinx outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the preceding four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 8.89%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderKeeping its earnings streak alive for the 12th successive quarter, Xilinx reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. Further, both the top line and bottom line increased year over year.Rising demand for 28-nm, 20-nm and 16-nm nodes, driven by higher wireless deployments and strength in the wired communication segment, are expected to remain growth drivers. The company’s product launches are likely to further aid revenues.We are also encouraged by Xilinx’s endeavor to return shareholder value through continued share buybacks and dividends. These investor-friendly initiatives not only boost earnings but also increase investors’ confidence and loyalty.However, a slowdown in the Chinese economy, along with economic weakness in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, could adversely affect Xilinx’s near-term results. Competition from the likes of Lattice Semiconductor Corporation (LSCC  -  Free Report) is another headwind.Xilinx, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Xilinx, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Xilinx, Inc.
