0,PFE,"Stocks remained lower Monday afternoon, when the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled, but indexes in general continued to pare losses.Indexes have been recovering since a steep drop at the open of nearly 1%. (For updates on this story and other market coverage, check Stock Market Today.)The Dow was off 0.5% in late afternoon trading. Intel (INTC) fell below its 50-day moving average after Northland Securities downgraded the chipmaker to underperform from market perform. It is not the first serious break of that line for Intel this year, but it threatens to snuff a good uptrend that the chipmaker was making.At Monday's lows, the Dow was only about 100 points above its starting level for the year. The Dow also is struggling with the 25,000 mark.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite was flat as it faced weakness in semiconductor and biotech shares.But small caps led, with the Russell 2000 up 0.4% in late trading. Market volume was lower, which is almost a given following Friday's quarterly ""witching,"" the options and futures expirations that tend to swell stock trading.Although the market was lower, much of the selling was concentrated in defensive industry groups.

1,PFE,"AstraZeneca (AZN) and Eli Lilly (LLY) became the latest Tuesday in a series of pharmaceutical companies to scrap studies of a potential Alzheimer's disease treatment that appeared unlikely to work.The drugmakers discontinued Phase 3 studies of a drug called lanabecestat. An independent data monitoring committee predicted lanabecestat would miss its goals in studies in early Alzheimer's disease and in mild Alzheimer's dementia.""The complexity of Alzheimer's disease poses one of the most difficult medical challenges of our time,"" Lilly Research Labs President Daniel Skovronsky said in a written statement. ""We are grateful for the contributions of the study participants and their families.""Lanabecestat belongs to a class of drugs called BACE inhibitors, which work to prevent the buildup of a substance called beta amyloid plaque in the brain. Researchers believe the toxic substance is at the center of Alzheimer's disease.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAstraZeneca and Lilly are far from the only pharmaceutical companies frustrated in their pursuit of an Alzheimer's disease treatment. Dow Jones component Merck (MRK) ended studies of its drug, verubecestat, in mild-to-moderate and early Alzheimer's disease.Earlier this year, fellow Dow Jones stock Pfizer (PFE) abandoned its research into treatments for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In May, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) stopped studies of its BACE inhibitor in patients with late-stage Alzheimer's disease on liver worries.In 2016, Lilly stock crashed after another drug missed its goals in a Phase 3 study. Lilly studied the drug, solanezumab, in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease.The market is increasingly looking to Biogen, which is working on a monoclonal antibody. Its drug, known as aducanumab, works to remove beta amyloid plaques in the brain. Analysts expect Biogen to have data for its key study in 2019 or 2020.Lilly said Tuesday it doesn't expect significant costs associated with its decision to end these studies of a potential Alzheimer's disease treatment. It reaffirmed its guidance for 2018 and its midterm guidance for the remainder of this decade.""We are committed to ensuring our findings can be used to inform further research in the Alzheimer's community, given the importance of finding a treatment for this disease,"" said AstraZeneca spokesperson Menelas Pangalos in a statement.On the stock market today, Lilly sank a fraction to close at 85.49.

2,PFE,"Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) toppled Thursday after Dow Jones component Pfizer (PFE) unveiled strong late-stage results for a competing rare-disease drug.Shares of Alnylam plunged 8.3% to 119.10 at the close, hitting their lowest point since Feb. 9. Ionis stock tumbled to a seven-month low, closing down 4%, at 44.08. Pfizer rose 0.5%, to 35.49.Evercore analyst Umer Raffat called the Pfizer release ""a very rare late-stage pipeline surprise ... especially for Pfizer,"" in a note to clients. The study hit all its key goals for a use that most investors had begun to think was impossible, he said.Pfizer studied a drug called tafamidis to treat transthyretin cardiomyopathy, a disease tied to progressive heart failure.

He has an 86 price target on the stock. He sees ""substantial competitive risks that do not appear to be priced into expectations for (Alnylam's drug) patisiran.""Evercore's Raffat expects tafamidis to be 4% accretive to Pfizer's earnings per share. Investors will likely debate whether tafamidis will treat only cardiomyopathy or if it can be extended to the broad ATTR population.

3,PFE,"Dow Jones component Pfizer (PFE) is teaming up with a group of former Kite Pharma executives to take on Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Novartis (NVS) in advanced cancer treatments.Early Tuesday, Pfizer said it entered into an alliance with privately held Allogene Therapeutics to develop advanced forms of chimeric antigen receptor T cell, or CAR-T, therapy. Pfizer will take a 25% stake in Allogene.These therapies represent ""a potentially transformative approach to treating cancer, and we are very excited about what the future may hold for this area of research,"" Pfizer's head of oncology research and development Robert Abraham said in a written statement.During the regular session on the stock market today, Pfizer rose 1.8% to close at 35.68. Gilead ticked up 0.8% to 73.75. Novartis advanced 0.7% to 80.12.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseCAR-T therapies from Gilead and Novartis already are on the market. These drugs are created using a patient's own extracted immune cells. Scientists reprogram a patient's cells to fight cancer before returning them to the patient.Pfizer and Allogene are aiming to create an allogeneic version of the treatment, which uses healthy donor cells. If successful, allogeneic CAR-T drugs would be less costly to produce than traditional CAR-T treatments.Scientists remain split on whether the allogeneic approach will work. But that was also the case for traditional CAR-T therapies. Then, Gilead and Novartis grabbed approvals in several types of blood cancer, Allogene Chief Executive and President David Chang said.""Many believed the idea of CAR-T therapy was rooted in science fiction, but science fiction has become a reality,"" he said in a written statement.Chang was Kite's chief medical officer and headed up its research department. Gilead bought Kite last year just after U.S. regulators approved its drug, Yescarta, to treat an aggressive form of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Arie Belldegrun, Kite founder and former chief executive, also moved to Allogene where he will serve as executive chairman.Pfizer will also keep its 8% stake in Cellectis (CLLS). The deal with Allogene will also allow Cellectis and Allogene to work together on allogeneic CAR-T. Cellectis is furthest along with an allogeneic approach, while Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP) is working on a rival.French pharma group Servier is sponsoring two clinical tests of Pfizer and Cellectis' partnered drug, UCART19. The drug is in Phase 1 studies as a potential treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. If approved, it would be an ""off-the-shelf"" form of CAR-T.""The development of off-the-shelf, allogeneic CAR-T therapy in the field of oncology initiates a revolution that could potentially expand access of such innovative treatment to a larger number of oncologists and patients,"" Servier President Olivier Laureau said in a prepared statement.RELATED:How Much Money Do You Need To Start Investing?Long-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFsShould You Buy A Stock Ahead Of Its Earnings Report?

7,PFE,"A dozen drugs launching in 2018 from heavy hitters like Roche (RHHBY), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) are expected to reach blockbuster status by the end of 2022, an analytics firm says.Clarivate Analytics describes 2018 as ""the year of the blockbuster,"" in which these 12 drugs have either launched or are expected to launch, and eventually bring in north of $1 billion in sales over a five-year period. That's the biggest number since Clarivate began making its forecast in 2013.It's setting up ""to be an exciting year that will see valuable additions to existing treatments as well as disruptions to certain markets and first-in-class treatment options for some diseases,"" the firm said in its report, issued late Thursday.By the end of 2022, three drugs from Roche, Gilead and Novo Nordisk (NVO) are expected to top $3 billion each in annual sales with the remaining nine likely to account for $1 billion to $2 billion a year in revenue, analysts said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAmong the 12 are two diabetes drugs, a Food and Drug Administration-approved medicine derived from cannabis plants and the first in a series of drugs expected to prevent migraines in some patients. In all, these dozen drugs are projected to collectively top $22.5 billion in sales in 2022.Roche's Hemlibra, a treatment for some patients with hemophilia A, tops the list and is expected to generate north of $4 billion in sales in 2022. Though there only 350,000 hemophilia A patients in the world — with roughly 30% of them eligible for Hemlibra — the treatment costs $482,000 the first year and $448,000 every year after that.The drug was approved three months early and launched in December 2017. Sales of $496 million are forecast for 2018 with the drug set to reach blockbuster status in 2019 at a forecasted $1.46 billion.Hemlibra is expected to take share from Shire's (SHPG) Feiba and Novo Nordisk's NovoSeven.Hemlibra also will compete against Bioverativ's (BIVV) Eloctate and Shire's Advate. For 2018, Eloctate was forecast to be a blockbuster, but Advate will continue to be the market leader with an estimated $1.8 billion in sales.""However, (Advate) sales are forecast to decline further thereafter,"" the Clarivate report said.Gilead's Biktarvy grabbed approval in February and targets an estimated 37 million people globally living with HIV. Of those, 21 million are receiving antiretroviral therapy which suppresses viral replication and allows the immune system to strengthen.Biktarvy adds to Gilead's HIV franchise which has long rivaled that of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). The two have traded market share since 2006 when Gilead first entered the market with Atripla. Two of Gilead's HIV drugs were featured in Clarivate's 2016 Drugs to Watch report.In 2019, Biktarvy will become a blockbuster, generating $2.28 billion in sales before spiking to $4.3 billion in 2021 and declining to $3.72 billion in 2022, the report says. The trajectory is similar to GSK drug Triumeq, which is expected to bring in $3.68 billion this year, five years after its launch.Rounding out the top three, Novo Nordisk got approval for diabetes drug Ozempic in December. The drug helps stimulate the body's own insulin release and limit how much sugar gets into the blood from the liver, and slows down how quickly food leaves the stomach.Ozempic is expected to become a blockbuster in 2020 with $1.58 billion in revenue on its way to $3.47 billion in 2022.In 2017, immuno-oncology treatments from Novartis (NVS) and Gilead grabbed headlines for ""their ability to revolutionize the treatment of the disease,"" the report said. And more than half of all drugs on the potential blockbuster list were cancer therapies.But in 2018 just one drug on the list of expected blockbusters is a cancer treatment.Erleada, a product of Dow Jones component Johnson & Johnson, was approved in February to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer that hasn't spread across the body. J&J and fellow Dow Jones component Pfizer (PFE) have drugs that treat the same cancer once it's spread.""While Zytiga and Xtandi battle to expand their market share, including the market for patients with non-metastatic disease, J&J's second-generation oral anti-androgen, Erleada, became the first approved in that setting in mid-February 2018,"" Clarivate said.The drug is projected to bring in $1.2 billion in 2020 and rise to $2 billion in 2022. It also could be expanded to treat other forms of prostate cancer and in combination with J&J's Zytiga contribute to its blockbuster potential.In 2021, GSK's shingles vaccine, called Shingrix, and a rare disease drug from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) known as patisiran are expected to join the blockbuster list with $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion in sales, respectively.Revenue is expected to hit a respective $1.37 billion and $1.21 billion in 2022.GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH) is expected to grab approval this summer for the first cannabidiol drug derived from the cannabis plant to treat patients with two seizure disorders. In 2022, the drug, called Epidiolex, is expected to generate $1.19 billion in sales.""If approved, Epidiolex will likely encounter bureaucratic barriers to distribution and political hurdles associated with cannabis-derived medicines, particularly in the U.S., where strict guidelines for use of medicinal cannabis exist,"" the report said.But the biotech isn't alone in this market. Cara Pharmaceuticals (CARA), Insys Therapeutics (INSY) and Zynerba Pharmaceuticals (ZYNE) are also working on treatments based on the cannabis plant.A migraine drug from Amgen (AMGN) and Novartis, Aimovig, is projected to bring in $115 million in 2018 sales before spiking to $1.17 billion in 2022 sales. This drug, and others like it, seek to prevent migraines by blocking a specific peptide, or group of amino acids.If approved, Aimovig would be the first drug known as an anti-CGRP to market, ahead of Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA), Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) and Eli Lilly (LLY). Allergan (AGN) also is working in this area.""A first-in-class mover advantage will be crucial for Aimovig since competition from two other subcutaneously administered monoclonal antibodies targeting CGRP is not far behind,"" Clarivate said. Lilly and Teva filed for FDA approval of their drugs late last year.Meanwhile, Alder is in Phase 3 testing with its drug. Analysts are worried, though, that Alder may falter in submitting its application to the FDA after co-founder Randall Schatzman unexpectedly stepped down from his chief executive role on Tuesday.In other areas, Shire's lanadelumab, a treatment for a swelling disorder, is forecast to bring in $1.15 billion in 2022. Next is AbbVie's (ABBV) Elagolix, a treatment for painful symptoms associated with menstruation.Rounding out the list, Pfizer and Merck's (MRK) diabetes drug Steglatro and Indivior's opioid dependence drug Sublocade are forecast to become blockbusters in 2022 with $1.09 billion and $1.07 billion in sales, respectively.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow Much Money Do You Need To Start Investing?How To Build Long-Term Profits In Stocks?

8,PFE,"Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) extended its lead in treating a specific form of muscular dystrophy Thursday as the maker of a rival drug, Solid Biosciences (SLDB), cratered when regulators placed its trial for the treatment on a clinical hold.The action by the Food and Drug Administration was announced late Wednesday. An adolescent patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy treated with Solid Bio's gene therapy experienced decreases in platelets and red blood cells. But there were no liver issues and he didn't suffer a bleeding disorder, which had been a source of concern.Wall Street shouldn't completely discount Solid Bio, Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz said, as the patient already has improved and is back on the trial. Schwartz noted the stock reaction is likely exacerbated by the resignation of an advisor worried about the therapy. Dr. James Wilson expressed worries over the treatment in January when he resigned from Solid Bio's scientific advisory board.""Solid is farther behind Sarepta in Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene therapy, but it is too early to eliminate the company from the competitive landscape,"" Schwartz said in a note to clients. Dow Jones component Pfizer (PFE) also is working on a gene therapy to treat the same disorder.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn the stock market today, Sarepta fell 1.3% to close at 81.22, as shares of Solid Bio collapsed 64.6% to 9.32, a fall of nearly 17. The firm filed its initial public offering in January at 16.Solid Bio is evaluating a gene therapy called SGT-001. It would rival a gene therapy from Sarepta called micro-dystrophin. Both gene therapies are using adeno-associated viral vectors that can insert genetic material at a specific site on a specific chromosome.But Sarepta's gene therapy is constructed differently from Solid Bio's, Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young said in her note to clients. She doesn't see Solid Bio's clinical hold as indicating any future issues for Sarepta's gene therapies.""We do not yet know the source of Solid's safety issue, but we remain comfortable with the robust preclinical safety and toxicology studies and previous clinically dosed study of the micro-dystrophin gene therapies,"" she said.Sarepta and Solid Bio also differ in the patients evaluated in their trials, Instinet analyst Christopher Marai said in a note. Sarepta and partner Nationwide Children's Hospital are testing patients age three months to three years and age four to seven.""The trial will enroll younger patients, as they may benefit more substantially from the therapy,"" he said. ""This differs from the Solid Bio trial that started enrolling adolescents, with the first patient enrolled being non-ambulatory.""Sarepta is about to administer its gene therapy to a third patient, indicating it was safe in the first two patients who received it, Marai said. The micro-dystrophin gene therapy was tested in nonhuman primates and scored well on safety issues, he added.It's important to note that the adverse events in Solid Bio's first patient didn't align with Dr. Wilson's worries, Marai said. Wilson had warned of liver toxicities and bleeding disorders as a result of a high dose of therapies using adeno-associated viral vectors like SGT-001 and micro-dystrophin. Sarepta is testing a higher dose of its gene therapy, but also hasn't seen those issues.Marai slashed his price target on Solid Bio to 37 from 52, though he kept a buy rating.The setback for Solid Bio could be considered ""an incremental positive for Sarepta,"" RBC analyst Brian Abrahams said in a report. But, it could also indicate that there are some issues with gene therapies based on adeno-associated viral vectors.""It will take some time to work out whether the adverse events are unique to Solid's program or could potentially be indicative of broader complications associated with adeno-associated viral vectors-based gene therapies,"" he said.RELATED:Investing Basics: How To Sell A StockSell And Take Profits Or Hold?

9,PFE,"President Trump offered a plan Friday to reduce the prices of costly ethical drugs, and the speech spurred generally positive reactions within the pharmaceutical and related industries.The biotech group was among the day's top three industries of the 197 tracked by IBD, rising 2.7%. Generic drugmakers rallied 2.5% as a group, while ethical drug stocks bounded up 2.4%, drugstores were up 1.7%, managed care up 1.6%, and wholesale drug supply up 1.4%.Meanwhile, the major equity indexes played small ball throughout most of Friday's session. But they finished the week with smart gains as IBD upgraded the stock market current outlook to ""Uptrend resumes"" on Thursday. The Nasdaq composite rushed 2.7% higher for the week. The S&P 500 lifted 2.4%.  Apple (AAPL) also posted a second straight weekly gain.The iPhone giant halted a nine-session winning streak, but still closed the bullish week up more than 2% at 188.59. That's on top of a 13% jump the prior week in unusually heavy volume. The recent rally has hoisted Apple as much as 6% past a new proper buy point of 179.04 in a very mild seven-week double-bottom base. (Read the latest updates in stock market action by going to the Stock Market Today landing page.)The Nasdaq composite edged 0.1% lower, but the S&P 500 inched nearly 0.2% higher. The Dow Jones industrial average rallied 0.3%, thanks to gains of 1 point or more from Big Pharma components Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE). UnitedHealth Group (UNH), another Dow Jones industrial component, also rose 4.57, or 2%, to 238.28.Merck is still trying to clear stubborn upside resistance at the long-term 200-day moving average. A 38 Relative Price Strength Rating means Merck is outperforming only 38% of all companies in IBD's database over the past 12 months.The small cap S&P 600 ticked 0.1% higher.

10,PFE,"Eli Lilly (LLY) is trying to ""leapfrog"" Dow Jones stock Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) with its $1.6 billion acquisition of cancer immunotherapy biotech Armo Biosciences (ARMO), an industry observer said Thursday.Drugmaker Lilly is late to the game in cancer immunotherapy, Brad Loncar told Investor's Business Daily. Loncar runs several biotech stock indexes including the Cancer Immunotherapy Sector Index, which contains Armo. The Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy exchange-traded fund popped 3.6% Thursday.""The leaders are Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb and Roche (RHHBY),"" he said. ""If you're a company that has completely missed the boat and you want to play in this area, you have to do something to try to leapfrog the competition.""Early Thursday, Lilly made its first big move in the cancer immunotherapy space — an area of medicine in which drugs teach the immune system to fight cancer. Lilly said it would pay $50 per share of Armo in an all-cash deal.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseArmo shares rocketed 67% to close at 49.80, as Lilly stock rose 2% to 80.86. Fellow drug stocks, like Merck and Bristol, both rose less than 1%. Roche, which had a failure early in the day in colon cancer, dipped 1.6% to 27.63.Lilly expects the deal to close by the end of the second quarter. Armo, a late-stage biotech, went public at 17 in January and quickly popped. It was a ""hot"" initial public offering, Loncar said, noting that its price early Thursday indicates investors may expect another bid on it.Leerink analyst Jonathan Chang noted that the acquisition price is a 68% premium over Armo's closing price Wednesday. He initiated coverage of the stock with an outperform rating and 50 price target earlier in the year. On Thursday, he downgraded Armo to market perform.""The deal confirms our investment thesis on Armo and, in our view, could read positively to other emerging immuno-oncology stocks,"" he said. ""It is unclear if other bidders will emerge, given (the) short closing date.""The acquisition makes sense as pharmaceutical stock Lilly tries to assert itself in the cancer immunotherapy space, Loncar said. Armo's lead drug, called pegilodecakin, is known as a cytokine. It boosts the strength of drugs known as PD-1 inhibitors, like Merck's Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo.Earlier this year, Bristol validated another cytokine drug called NKTR-214 by paying $1.85 billion upfront to partner with Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) on it. The deal hit a record for an upfront payment in biotech, Loncar said. Now, it's of little surprise that Armo is to be taken out.Loncar has consistently predicted that 2018 would be a big year for biotech deals, mergers and takeouts. The year kicked off with news of Celgene's (CELG) plan to buy Juno Therapeutics and Sanofi's (SNY) bids on Bioverativ (BIVV) and Ablynx (ABLX).But this deal for Armo is a little different, he said.""I think this one would have happened if we were in the middle of a terrible, bear market,"" he said. On the other hand, ""this is also a good example of large companies like Eli Lilly, many of them have not been at the forefront of innovation and they're having to buy into that.""Still, Lilly isn't alone in its trailing position in cancer immunotherapy. Roche, AstraZeneca (AZN) and Pfizer (PFE) all have immuno-oncology drugs, but remain behind Merck and Bristol which are ""on a level of their own,"" he said.The cancer immunotherapy space desperately needed some good news, he said. Earlier this year, Incyte's (INCY) drug, known as an IDO inhibitor, failed in a late-stage combination with Merck's Keytruda in melanoma. Incyte's pain extended to other cancer immunotherapy stocks.Background volatility remains in the cancer immunotherapy space, Loncar said. The key, he said, is that these are all different pieces of technology. The Armo drug is different from the Incyte drug known as epacadostat.""Every news item sets people's moods,"" he said. ""Everybody is down on immunotherapy and thinks it's overrated. Then a deal like this happens and it causes the opposite reaction. Whenever you have an emerging technology like this it's going to be a roller coaster.""RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Tame A Volatile Swing Trade With A Half PositionLooking For The Next Nvidia?

Exxon and Pfizer (PFE) battled for the Dow's top position, while only a handful of blue chips declined. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 also each climbed 0.4%.

12,PFE,"AstraZeneca (AZN), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are the likeliest targets of a biopharma ""detonation event"" in which tax reform spurs widespread mergers and acquisitions across the group, an analyst said Friday.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez calls the coming consolidation ""inevitable.""Products made by the likes of AbbVie (ABBV), Roche (RHHBY), Amgen (AMGN), Dow Jones stock Merck (MRK), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Shire (SHPG) are soon to face new competition and generic rivals.This follows ""an unprecedented period of innovation and new product launches within large biopharma,"" he said in a note to clients. ""Several of the largest companies will likely experience a substantial growth slowdown within the next five to seven years.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseCelgene, Biogen and AstraZeneca would be most accretive to a potential acquirer, based on short-term financials, Fernandez said. Their average accretion in 2020 would be 25%, 14% and 13%, respectively.But Bristol, AstraZeneca and Vertex make the most sense long-term and strategically, he said. These three appear to be ""best positioned"" for longer-term revenue growth based on a look at consensus expectations for 2020-24.The last major consolidation period in biopharma occurred during the last decade, in which there were seven deals greater than $40 billion in value. The largest was Dow Jones stock Pfizer's (PFE) $93.8 billion acquisition of Warner-Lambert, at a 34% premium.Pfizer also paid the biggest premium, 38%, on Pharmacia, forking over $60.5 billion to acquire the firm. Merck paid a 34% premium to buy Schering-Plough for $45.7 billion. Since 2010, deals combining Pfizer with AstraZeneca and Allergan (AGN) and AbbVie with Shire have failed.Fernandez sees the next cycle as a seller's market. Pfizer is struggling with its late entry to the immuno-oncology market, whereas Merck has a strong immuno-oncology drug — Keytruda — but lacks a robust late-stage pipeline.Roche faces biosimilar competition for its top drugs: Avastin, Herceptin and Rituxan. Novartis (NVS) is still experiencing challenges in its Sandoz unit. AbbVie is strong in the near-term, but its key drug Humira will soon see competition in Europe and in the U.S. after 2022.Strategically, AstraZeneca would be a strong fit for AbbVie, Pfizer, Roche or Merck, Fernandez said. Bristol could fit in at AbbVie and Pfizer. Meanwhile, it's possible AbbVie could swing for Vertex.Through a financial lens, AstraZeneca, Vertex, Biogen and Bristol are the most compelling targets for their ability to enhance long-term sales, he said.Amgen could be an acquirer or a target with $70 billion in funds to buy something, Fernandez said. Assuming Amgen is looking to make a deal valued at less than $90 billion, Vertex rises to the top of the list among the potential targets, outlasting Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Shire.""Among the three, Vertex looks more interesting,"" he said.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityLong-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFsShould You Buy A Stock Ahead Of Its Earnings Report?

No company has cut its dividend, marking the first Q1 with no decreases since at least 2003.Among all the companies that S&P Dow Jones Indices tracks, 948 companies made positive dividend moves in Q1, and 167 made negative ones, representing a collective net payout increase of $18.8 billion, a record high.""Dividends are typically event driven,"" Silverblatt told IBD last month.

19,PFE,"Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) is a biotech worth $4 billion, but it doesn't market a single drug — yet in 2018 it's expected to approach $200 million in sales and its stock is breaking out.X The reason is Ligand operates under a unique business model in which it acquires early-stage technologies necessary for drug development. It then licenses those platforms out to biotechs and pharmas like Dow Jones stocks Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE), as well as Amgen (AMGN) and Novartis (NVS).In total, Ligand has more than 165 programs in development with north of 95 partners, the firm said during its fourth-quarter conference call in February. Craig-Hallum Capital Group analyst Matt Hewitt praised the model in a Feb. 22 report to clients.""Given a larger-than-ever and expanding portfolio of current and potential future royalty generating assets, a broad pipeline of partnerships, and a model inherently geared to deliver very high profit margins, we believe there is tremendous value creation in motion at Ligand,"" he said.Shareholders seem to agree with Hewitt's assessment. Ligand stock has popped more than 27% since the beginning of the year, outperforming the broader biotech group, which has risen roughly 11% over the same time period.On Thursday, shares jumped in early-morning trades to break out of a second-stage, six-week flat base. Shares ended the regular session up 4% to 174.70.Ligand shares have been on a run since last week, jumping at least 2% per day during a stretch of three straight trading sessions. Meanwhile, the biotech group has been in the red for four of the past seven sessions.The stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it performs in the top 2% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. In the biotech group, it's ranked third behind Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Halozyme Therapeutics (HALO), which both have ratings of 99.Ligand demonstrated its dominance in the fourth quarter. Total revenue grew 32.2% to $50.46 million, topping the consensus for $47 million, Roth Capital Partners analyst Scott Henry wrote in a recent note to clients.Royalties, the main driver of sales, increased 44.6% to $28.3 million, in line with expectations, Henry said. The upside to revenue drove adjusted earnings per share of $1.31, spiking 77% vs. the year-earlier quarter and beating analyst views by 25 cents.Better-than-expected sales of Amgen's Kyprolis and Novartis' Promacta led the revenue charge. Ligand gets a 4.7%-9.4% royalty on sales of Promacta, an oral medicine to increase the number of platelets in the blood, and a 1.5%-3% royalty on sales of multiple myeloma drug Kyprolis.In total, Ligand is tied to a dozen commercial products. It has five technology platforms that biotechs and pharmas can use to develop drugs. The firm also has a handful of early-stage drugs it plans to license out to interested companies for further development.Ligand's goal is to create a diversified company ""with more licensing opportunities and lower impact of individual patent expiry,"" the firm says. That protects it from the scenario now facing biotech leader Celgene (CELG) which will see its patents on cancer drug Revlimid begin to expire in the mid-2020s.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

""If LGD-6972 is successfully developed, this license with Roivant has the potential to be Ligand's largest financial asset with the possibility of annual royalties (continuing) in the late 2030s.""All this could offer upside to 2018 guidance for $116 million in royalty revenue, $23 million in sales related to Captisol — a compound used in pharma development — and $25 million related to milestones and license fees, analysts say.""Ligand tends to under-promise and over-deliver when it comes to annual guidance,"" Roth Capital's Henry said. ""We expect 2018 to be more of the same. Our revenue and (earnings-per-share) targets of $166 million and $4.28, which we view as conservative, should surpass the company's guidance.""Henry expects Kyprolis and Promacta sales to moderate in 2018. He calls for Kyprolis sales to grow 19%, down from 26% in 2017, and for Promacta sales to increase 20%, down from 37% in 2017. Any sustained movement for these drugs could provide upside to the guidance, he said.Ligand, though, is bullish on both drugs. CEO Higgins called for Kyprolis and Promacta to both become blockbusters in 2018. Promacta has been on the market for nine years, so seeing that level of growth is ""particularly impressive,"" he said on the earnings call.""In 2018, Promacta will become a $1 billion molecule, with analysts projecting continued strong growth beyond,"" he said. ""And for Kyprolis, given recently reported sales numbers, that drug appears to us to also be on track to exceed $1 billion in worldwide sales in 2018.""Ligand's partners currently have a handful of drugs in late-stage testing including brexanolone, a postpartum depression drug from Sage Therapeutics (SAGE), and a slew of others in Phase 2 trials. Of its partnered programs, 42% are preclinical and 25% are in Phase 1 studies.The firm expects to benefit from current trends including the new U.S. tax law, which reduced Ligand's projected tax rate by more than one-third, Higgins said on the earnings call. Ligand also will get a boost from a bump in FDA drug approvals.A recent study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found the success rate of drug programs advancing to approval has increased.""We believe this can be attributed to many factors, including better decisions with advancing programs and a more favorable regulatory environment,"" he said. ""This is very meaningful for Ligand, as we have over 165 programs at all stages of development.""RELATED:How To Tame A Volatile Swing Trade With A Half PositionHow To Trade Stocks: Why Most Penny Stocks Fail To Make Investors RichLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

21,PFE,"A couple of relatively obscure biotechs are challenging the likes of Novartis (NVS) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) with a new form of treating cancer that not only could undercut their bigger rivals, it could render recently approved oncology drugs from those drug giants obsolete.X Novartis and Gilead are still in the early stages of launching their respective drugs called Kymriah and Yescarta, which are known as CAR-T drugs. But Cellectis (CLLS) and Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP) — each with a tiny fraction of their rivals' market cap — already are creeping in with an off-the-shelf variation on CAR-T therapy that uses healthy donor cells to create a less expensive version of these cancer drugs.This could make treatments from Novartis and Gilead ""less attractive or obsolete,"" Instinet analyst Christopher Marai told Investor's Business Daily.""Never mind pricing. (These) could be dosed more effectively,"" Marai said.CAR-T therapy is a form of oncology treatment currently created by extracting immune cells from a patient's blood. Using an ""empty"" virus, drugmakers affix what are known as chimeric antigen receptors to the immune system T cells.These receptors, also known as CARs, are proteins that can recognize other proteins used by cancer cells to hide in the body. When these re-engineered T cells are reintroduced to the body, they are directed to seek out and destroy cancer cells carrying those proteins.But the process is complex and costly. It's also tailored to individuals, meaning these drugs can't be mass produced and often take weeks to manufacture. Some patients die while they're waiting, Crispr Chief Executive Sam Kulkarni told Investor's Business Daily.His off-the-shelf approach to CAR-T is aiming to change that.Off-the-shelf CAR-T, also known as allogeneic, uses healthy donor cells to prompt the same immune response as first-generation CAR-Ts that Novartis and Gilead are using, known as autologous. Kulkarni says the donor cells are typically healthier, allowing for a more robust response in patients.The manufacturing process is less complex and, from one run, could make hundreds of doses, Kulkarni said. And because the process is uniform, it's less costly. Cellectis has estimated its cost of goods at less than $5,000 per patient. Autologous CAR-T runs into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, experts say.Kulkarni and Marai note the benefits of allogeneic CAR-T could be huge if the theory pans out in late-stage clinical testing.Healthy donor cells could also prompt a better response than using compromised T cells from a cancer patient, they say. Patients could also potentially receive repeat doses if the benefit doesn't persist from one dose. That's difficult with the much pricier autologous CAR-T.""Overall, allogeneic is so much more powerful because it's off-the-shelf,"" Kulkarni said. ""A patient can be treated the very next day. They (allogeneic CAR-Ts) have a good chance of working better than autologous CAR-Ts and they can be accessible broadly to patients.""But this theory is still a little short in the tooth. In December, Cellectis with partners Servier and Pfizer (PFE), a Dow Jones industrial average component, unveiled the results of its first clinical trial that used donor cells to create a CAR-T treatment for a form of leukemia.Brad Loncar, who runs the biotech fund known as Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF (CNCR), called the results mixed. In patients with a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the drug known as UCART19 resulted in an 83% complete remission rate across adult and pediatric patients.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

""If they have equal (effectiveness), that's a gigantic thing to say and it's far from proven. And there's reason to believe that it will never be so.""Allogeneic CAR-T could be the ""holy grail"" of oncology therapies, said Nadeem Sheikh, vice president of research and development for privately held Dendreon Pharmaceuticals. Dendreon makes an immunotherapy treatment called Provenge for advanced prostate cancer.""The entire cancer field would love something like an allogeneic approach,"" he told Investor's Business Daily. ""The allogeneic approach is: I could take your cells and give them to me. That's the holy grail. But we know there's a lot of problems with that approach.""Using a donor's cells could introduce the potential for a condition known as graft-versus-host disease, Sheikh said. With that disease, the donor immune cells don't recognize their surroundings and begin to indiscriminately attack everything that appears foreign.Crispr's Kulkarni thinks he has the answer. The company's gene editing process uses a technique called CRISPR in which a receptor on the donor's T cells is removed, preventing those cells from wildly attacking unintended targets.""Essentially, by using CRISPR we change the genetics of the healthy donor's T cells,"" he said. ""When we do that, they no longer will indiscriminately attack the patient's cells. They only attack the tumor within the patient.""By performing a second edit, the donor T cells are then engineered to appear as if they belong in the body so the patient's own immune cells won't try to destroy the donor cells, Kulkarni said. This allows the donor cells to persist longer in the body.""Think of CRISPR as like a blow torch,"" he said. ""You can actually cut metal and weld metal with it. Here, we can either add genes or remove genes from a cell. Essentially we take a healthy person's T cells and make the CAR-Ts by adding or subtracting genes.""Cellectis is in a class of its own in allogeneic CAR-T, Loncar said. Its Servier/Pfizer-partnered drug, UCART19, already has preliminary Phase 1 data. Its own drug, UCART123, is in testing in acute myeloid leukemia and a form of leukemia known as blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm.In February, Cellectis was granted a pair of U.S. patents to use CRISPR gene editing for the genetic engineering of T cells. Cellectis said it plans to make these patents available for licensing to other companies willing to use CRISPR technology in T cells.The theory is catching on quickly, even among the biggest first-generation CAR-T players. Gilead announced its acquisition of Kite in late August. The merger closed on Oct. 3 just before the FDA approved Kite's drug Yescarta on Oct. 18. Now Gilead is eyeing the allogeneic approach.Last month, Gilead partnered with Sangamo Therapeutics (SGMO) for $150 million up front to develop cellular therapies using a technique of gene editing called zinc finger nucleases. This process of gene editing is more complex and costly than the CRISPR technology used by Crispr, Editas Medicine (EDIT) and Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA).Under terms of its deal with Gilead, Sangamo is eligible for up to $3.01 billion in potential payments across 10 or more products. The two will work on autologous and allogeneic approaches to cellular therapy.Crispr, the biotech, also is working on an allogeneic CAR-T therapy called CTX101. Like Yescarta from Gilead and Kymriah from Novartis, it targets the CD19 protein, meaning it could potentially be used to treat similar blood cancers. So far, the firm has had three meetings with the FDA to discuss filing an investigational new drug application, Kulkarni said.Such an application would allow Crispr to begin a clinical trial. Kulkarni expects to file an application by the end of the year to begin clinical testing in 2019. He's bullish on Crispr's prospects, but notes it will ""take a lot of up-front time and energy.""""I think we're still in early days,"" he said. ""We have to see how the data bear out and autologous CAR-T has a head start with a number of trials. But if allogeneic starts working in one tumor type, it's a very scalable program.""RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Tame A Volatile Swing Trade With A Half PositionLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

23,PFE,"Dow's Pfizer (PFE) won't have to pay Biogen (BIIB) a cent in royalties for a competing multiple sclerosis drug after a court decision Friday invalidated the last patent on Biogen's Avonex.X The decision hinged on a 2009 patent, which was issued 13 years after Avonex first was approved to go to market. The patent would have covered Avonex as a multiple sclerosis treatment until 2026. The patent was first filed in 1995, and covered uses of interferons that dated back decades.But since its issuance, Pfizer and partner EMD Serono have continued to sell Rebif, a rival drug that also belongs to a class known as beta interferon. Novartis (NVS) also has continued to sell Extavia, a copycat of Bayer's (BAYRY) rival drug, Betaseron.""We don't believe investors were fully convinced of (the patent's) utility,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients. ""We certainly regarded this patent as of limited utility to keep competitors of any kind off the market given the obvious continuing sales of Rebif, Betaseron and Extavia.""The jury invalidated Biogen's patent, finding that prior knowledge existed of interferons as a treatment for a number of different medical conditions. Biogen had tried to argue that Pfizer and EMD Serono had infringed on two claims of the patent.""As a result of this finding, there is effectively no patent to infringe and no royalty or settlement obligation payable by Serono to Biogen,"" Porges said. ""Biogen was seeking multibillion-dollar damages on the basis of a claimed 8.5% royalty on future and prior sales, as well as damages.""Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!This decision also likely ends Biogen's ongoing litigation with Novartis over drugs Betaseron and Extavia, Porges said. It's likely Biogen will appeal the decision, but in the meantime it relieves the companies of having to pay Biogen anything for their competing products.Biogen declined to comment to Investor's Business Daily on the case. The biotech ""will have to look hard at the cost of continuing this litigation to appeal, for what is a declining product and a trial with a low probability of legal success,"" Porges said.Porges doesn't expect a flood of generic entrants to the class. Interferons are in decline, but still represent a $5.5 billion revenue category. The challenges of manufacturing, developing and commercializing a biosimilar version of interferon are significant.""If a biosimilar company had a high-quality version of a beta interferon product that it could establish as being biosimilar, then this patent — valid or not — was unlikely to have been a major deterrent,"" he said.On the stock market today, Biogen sank nearly 1% to close at 290.01. Pfizer climbed 2.3% to 37.09. Novartis advanced a fraction to 86.03.RELATED:This Biotech's Outlook Is Feeling The Flu — Is It Just A 'Blip'?Is This Biotech Hedging Its 2018 Outlook On A Key FDA Approval?Can CRISPR And These 3 Small Biotechs Cure 10,000 Diseases?

25,PFE,"Senate Republicans will delay implementation of a cut in the corporate tax rate to 20% until 2019. Meanwhile, House Republicans just filled a hole in their bill by hiking the tax rate charged on accumulated foreign earnings held overseas. Apple (AAPL) alone has $246 billion in accumulated profits that haven't been subject to U.S. taxes.XAnother House measure would aim to combat profit-shifting by companies such as Apple, Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Pfizer (PFE) to low-tax jurisdictions. The House GOP's 10% tax on high foreign returns would raise $5 billion in 2018 and $77 billion over a decade.The Senate has taken a related, but apparently tougher, approach in targeting U.S. companies that recognize profits from valuable intellectual property overseas to reduce their federal tax exposure. The Senate plan would charge a 12.5% tax on foreign income from intellectual property, which could raise about $130 billion, according to various reports.Initially, Republicans were expected to propose a 10% tax rate on cash equivalents and a 3% tax on illiquid assets, such as real estate, since some of that cash has been invested in new facilities. But the initial House bill released a week ago proposed a 12% tax on cash and a 5% tax on illiquid assets.Now that House Republicans have found themselves with a bill that would raise the deficit by about $1.575 trillion over a decade — or about $75 billion more than their budget resolution allows — they've turned to the easiest target to get over the finish line. The updated House Tax Cut and Jobs Act would impose a 14% tax on cash and a 7% tax on illiquid assets.While it's not clear if the higher tax on accumulated foreign profits will be in the final bill, the House bill's update and the Senate's proposed corporate tax changes both make clear that the GOP tax bill is moving in a direction that Wall Street finds worrisome. The unknown question is how much it will keep moving as Republicans aim to address some of the criticism aimed at the House bill, which would raise taxes on moderate-income families with children within a decade.The House Ways and Means Committee moved forward Thursday afternoon, approving the revised House GOP bill.The Senate legislation released Thursday would partially replace the corporate tax cut in 2018 with a one-year window for companies to write off all investments, apparently including structures. The House bill provides an immediate write-off of 100% of equipment purchases, which would lower corporate taxes by about $25 billion in the first year.IBD'S TAKE: The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 23,550 on Wednesday, up 1,650 points since IBD changed its market trend indicator on Aug. 22 to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a yellow light turning green. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite climbed off session lows on the stock market today as investors weighed emerging details of the Senate tax package. The Dow and S&P 500 still lost 0.4%, while the Nasdaq fell 0.6%. The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all set closing highs Wednesday, with tax-cut hopes helping to lift the major averages in recent weeks and over the past year.Some analysts have also warned that banks such as Dow component JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) could face additional taxes in the Senate bill after the House included a provision limiting big-bank deductions of FDIC premiums to raise $13.7 billion over a decade.Hatch on Wednesday mentioned a possibility that the corporate tax rate could phase out before the end of the decade, which still might allow for a 2018 start, since the corporate tax cut costs about $170 billion in 2027 vs. $100 billion in 2018.Hatch's suggestion underscores something that Republicans have been reluctant to admit: There's about a 0% chance that they'll be able to make a 20% corporate tax rate permanent. A temporary cut, however, would be expected to provide a more modest short-term economic lift before eventually turning into a drag on growth.RELATED:There's About 0% Chance Of A Permanent 20% Corporate Tax RateFour Reasons Why JPMorgan, Other Bank Stocks Keep FallingHouse GOP Tax Bill Takes Aim At Big Tech And Big PharmaThe House GOP Tax Bill Has A Big-Family ProblemNvidia Leads These 4 Top Earnings Reports Thursday: Investing Action PlanStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

Still, the S&P 500, which surged to record highs early in the session, gave up much of those gains by the close while the Nasdaq composite turned lower.While there a number of factors for the market's moves, including Apple (AAPL) and iPhone-related stocks retreating, there's no doubt that tax reform hopes have been a big contributor to the stock rally since President Trump's election.It's not hard to figure out what the big holdup is: Republicans are promising so much to businesses that they're having trouble making their tax cuts sufficiently attractive for individuals without busting the budget. If anything, President Trump is making their job harder by insisting on an immediate cut in the corporate rate to 20%, rather than a gradual phase-in, and pushing back against any changes in tax treatment of 401(k) accounts. Trump is likely to lose the latter battle and may lose the former.The GOP tax framework called for a $2.6 trillion net cut in business taxes, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis. That includes an immediate 20% corporate tax rate and a 25% rate for small businesses and partnerships whose business income is taxed via the individual tax code. While Republicans have some offsets they haven't yet spelled out, including a partial limit on interest deductibility for corporations and a minimum tax on overseas earnings, they need to at least cut the cost in half to allow room for individual tax cuts.Those interest deductibility limit could hit companies like Verizon (VZ), which has $100 billion in debt. Meanwhile, a minimum tax threatens to raise taxes on overseas earnings for companies like Pfizer (PFE), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Apple that face single-digit effective overseas tax rates.Even still, there would be scant room for individual tax cuts unless the GOP can magically find hundreds of billions of dollars in tax savings by limiting the size of pretax 401(k) contributions. While cutting the $18,000 limit in half would raise more than $100 billion, that's unlikely to be enough. Meanwhile, Republicans from high-tax states including New York, New Jersey and California seem to be waging a successful battle to preserve at least part of the state and local tax deduction, which will cost the federal government $1.3 trillion over a decade.The individual tax numbers aren't adding up, which is why the GOP is now willing to keep a 39.6% top income rate. The estate tax is another pressure point, but so far House leaders are sticking by their plan to kill it.The bigger picture is that Republicans have few votes to spare, with three defections enough to kill it in the Senate. Even if there is no further delay in releasing the GOP plan, it's not safe to assume that Republicans will eventually prevail and get big tax cuts passed.The first test will be the reaction of GOP lawmakers. The second big test will come when independent budget analysts determine who benefits from the tax cuts. One of the big shortcomings of the GOP tax framework is that the middle class didn't come out that well, with a less-generous inflation adjustment gradually shrinking or reversing their tax cuts.RELATED:This Is Why The GOP Tax Plan Will Lead To Higher Property TaxesThe GOP's Secret, Risky Strategy For Corporate Tax CutsHouse Continues To Toy With 401(k) Contribution Cap$100 Billion Question: Will Trump Let Alphabet, Pfizer Keep Tax Havens?Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

33,PFE,"GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) tumbled to a nine-month low Wednesday after the U.K. drugmaker reportedly said it would consider an acquisition to bulk its consumer health unit, but identified its prescription-drug segment as its top priority.XThose comments came during a conference call following Glaxo's earnings release. Although sales and earnings topped views, sales within Glaxo's established pharmaceuticals segment fell 4%. The business comprises a third of all pharma sales.""Our first priority is focused on improving our largest business, the core pharma business and (research and development) within that,"" Reuters reported Chief Executive Emma Walmsley saying during the call.Walmsley noted GSK considers itself a ""consolidator"" in the consumer health sector. At the same time, Dow stock Pfizer (PFE) is considering a potential sale of its consumer health business which includes brands like Advil and Centrum.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez says it's ""less likely"" Glaxo will put forth a bid on Pfizer's over-the-counter business.IBD'S TAKE: President Donald Trump could sign an executive order to pull down drug prices ""any day,"" according to a Washington, D.C.-based expert. Visit IBD Industry Themes for more on what that could do to the biotech and drug sectors.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Glaxo stock dropped 5.7% to 38.19. Shares have been forming a flat base with a buy point at 44.63 for about four months.For the third quarter ended Sept. 30, Glaxo reported about $10.33 billion in sales — at today's exchange rate — which topped the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $10.22 billion. Adjusted earnings of 85 cents per share topped the 81-cent view of analysts.Sales in Glaxo's pharmaceutical and consumer health care units grew 2% apiece on a constant-currency basis, though vaccine revenue was flat.Glaxo also maintained its guidance for adjusted earnings per share to grow 3%-5% on a constant-currency basis in 2017.RELATED:Biogen Dives Despite Topping Views; Lilly, Novartis BeatHow Allergan's 'Public Relations Backlash' Deepened This WeekDow Component Pfizer Mulls Over-The-Counter Spinoff Or Sale

34,PFE,"House GOP leaders are sticking by their plan for a permanent 20% corporate tax rate, but they've had to root around for every bit of loose tax-code change they can find to make the numbers work.In some cases, they've found some pretty big bills. One of the hard-to-interpret provisions takes aim at big technology and pharmaceutical companies that locate intellectual property in low-cost tax jurisdictions and have accumulated vast profits held overseas — Apple (AAPL) alone has $246 billion in accumulated foreign profits.Because the GOP plan aims to move the U.S. to more of a territorial tax system, in which profits are taxed where they are earned, the risk is that U.S. multinationals would engage in more of this behavior. To prevent that, the GOP bill would impose a 50% tax on ""high returns"" of U.S. companies' foreign subsidiaries. The provision is projected to raise $77 billion over a decade by the Joint Committee on Taxation.That provision may cancel out what looked like a big win for companies like Apple, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Pfizer (PFE) that currently pay single-digit tax rates on overseas profits. There was concern that the plan would impose a minimum tax of as much as 15% on future foreign earnings that would no longer be subject to U.S. taxes. Instead, the global minimum rate will reportedly be 10%, which by itself might have done less to combat the incentive for shifting profits to tax havens.Overall, the reaction to the GOP plan from businesses seems pretty mixed. Homebuilders hate it, and their shares have taken a hit in reaction to the proposed limiting of the mortgage deduction to new homes worth up to $500,000. The National Federation of Independent Business said the tax bill leaves ""too many small businesses behind,"" while the National Association of Manufacturers called it a ""grand slam.""House GOP leaders pitched their bill as a huge win for middle-class families, saying a family of four with $59,000 in income will take home an extra $1,200. However, that figure reflects first-year tax cuts, before they begin to phase out and are eroded by a less-generous inflation measure that produces a bigger tax take over time.In another mixed bag for multinationals, the tax rate imposed on earnings currently held overseas has crept up to 12% on cash equivalents and 5% on profits invested in illiquid assets.Companies with high leverage that were worried about losing their interest deduction seem to have a dodged a bullet. Provisions that limit interest deductibility would raise about $200 billion, nowhere near the $1 trillion-plus that could have been raised by eliminating the deduction.The Wall Street Journal reported that there would be a limit on interest deductions equal to 30% of earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA. That wouldn't appear to be much of a negative for Verizon (VZ), which carries $100 billion in debt but whose interest expense equaled about 33% of EBITDA in 2016. It might be a problem for companies with high debt and lower profits.The Dow Jones industrial average turned slightly positive in afternoon trading on the stock market today, while the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite were slightly negative. Stock futures had weakened overnight in part on reports that Republicans would phase out their proposed 20% corporate tax rate by 2027 to comply with Senate budget reconciliation rules that don't allow for increases in the deficit beyond the first decade.If the point of cutting corporate taxes is to provide businesses an incentive to make long-term investments in the U.S., then permanence is critical. But making the 20% rate permanent, at a cost of $3 trillion in the second decade, will almost certainly require making individual tax cuts temporary. Indeed, the GOP already said it will phase out a ""family flexibility"" of $300 per spouse and non-child dependent in 2023.IBD'S TAKE: The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 23,400 on Wednesday, up more than 1,500 points since IBD changed its market trend indicator on Aug. 22 to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a yellow light turning green. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. House Republicans caved into pressure and dropped their idea for limiting pretax 401(k) contributions, which could have given them hundreds of billions of extra funds to work with in the first decade, while lowering U.S. tax receipts beyond the budget window.The original House plan would have generated more than $1 trillion from a border-adjustment tax on imports that was quashed after an outcry from Wal-Mart (WMT) and other big retailers.Having given up on all such big revenue boosters to grease the skids for tax cuts that the public might find irresistible, the trick for the GOP will be making individual tax cuts sufficiently attractive.A preliminary Tax Policy Center analysis found that business tax cuts, including a cut for small businesses and partnerships whose income is taxed on an individual basis, would cost a net $2.6 trillion. The House bill will have to cut that cost by more than half to provide room for individual cuts.Further, the GOP gradually unwinds the individual tax cut by adopting a less-generous inflation gauge for adjusting tax brackets and the size of the new standard deduction. That's why the Tax Policy Center found that 30% of taxpayers with incomes from $50,000 to $150,000 would face tax hikes by 2027.RELATED:GOP Plan To Cut Mortgage Interest Deduction Slams These Housing StocksHouse Tax-Reform Bill Leaves Generous 401(k) Contribution Cap In PlaceThis Is Why The GOP Tax Plan Will Lead To Higher Property TaxesThe GOP's Secret, Risky Strategy For Corporate Tax CutsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

35,PFE,"Shares of Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) toppled early Tuesday after a U.S. appeals court upheld a ruling that invalidated a patent on blockbuster arthritis drug Remicade, just a week after it lost another blockbuster patent.X The decision limits J&J's ability to seek damages from fellow Dow stock Pfizer (PFE), which launched its Remicade biosimilar Inflectra in late 2016. According to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the antibodies covered were disclosed in an earlier patent, Bloomberg reported.J&J stock dipped as much as 2.9% on the news, which came about the time of its fourth-quarter earnings report. By the closing bell on the stock market today, J&J tumbled 4.3% to finish at 141.83. Just last week, the nation's top patent court invalidated a patent covering blockbuster cancer drug Zytiga.During the quarter, sales of Remicade fell 9.7% worldwide with the steepest decline in international sales, down 18.7% vs. the year-earlier period. Remicade is part of J&J's immunology unit, which grew 5.1%. But J&J says Remicade faced ""increased discounts/rebates and biosimilar competition.""Evercore analyst Umer Raffat says Pfizer's Inflectra, which competes directly with Remicade, didn't get much traction in the fourth quarter. Pfizer contends in its court complaint that J&J has blocked access to an overwhelming share of consumers with its ""Biosimilar Readiness Plan.""""It seems that J&J is protecting the volume by engaging in proactive rebating, which basically limits the uptake of any biosimilar,"" Raffat said in a note to clients.Late Tuesday, Pfizer issued this prepared statement: ""This is a good day for patients battling chronic diseases, because the court has ruled a key patent that J&J has asserted to block access to Inflectra is invalid. However, J&J continues to use their scheme of exclusionary contracts to maintain Remicade's monopoly position that prevent patients, payers and providers from the opportunity to benefit from Inflectra.""J&J responded by saying: ""We are disappointed with the Court's ruling. We believe that biopharmaceutical intellectual property protections, such as patents and data protection, enable us to invest in the discovery and development of tomorrow's life-changing and life-saving new medicines. We're proud of the impact Remicade has made in improving the health and lives of more than 2.6 million people worldwide and are committed to helping ensure Remicade remains accessible and affordable to patients.""Meanwhile, the new tax rate for corporations helped J&J issue Street-topping 2018 profit guidance, RBC analyst Glenn Novarro said after the bellwether health giant beat fourth-quarter sales and earnings expectations.But the full-year revenue forecast lagged analysts' collective view and drugs acquired through the takeover of Actelion Pharma missed Novarro's expectations.For 2018, J&J calls for $80.6 billion to $81.4 billion in sales and adjusted income of $8-$8.20 per share. Revenue guidance lagged the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $81.56 billion, but the adjusted earnings forecast crushed views for $7.86 a share.IBD'S TAKE: Some biotechs are poised to surprise to the upside in the fourth quarter, while others are still struggling with competition taking the edge off key products, analysts said in a preview of the earnings season. See what other schemes might crop up by visiting IBD Industry Themes.Novarro, who was less bullish, had predicted $79.7 billion in sales and adjusted profit of $7.90 per share for 2018.""We believe higher revenue guidance is a combination of better pharmaceutical performance and currency, while a lower tax rate is partially responsible for higher (earnings per share) guidance,"" he said in a note to clients.For the fourth quarter, the Dow stock reported adjusted income of $1.74 per share on $20.2 billion in sales, growing a respective 10.1% and 11.5% year over year. The consensus was for adjusted profit of $1.72 a share on $20.2 billion in sales.Worldwide pharmaceutical sales of $9.68 billion narrowly beat analysts' collective view for $9.66 billion, Novarro said. Organically, sales growth was 7.6% on a constant-currency basis.Sales of anticoagulant Xarelto and a schizophrenia drug topped expectations, he said. Cancer drugs Imbruvica and Darzalex were in line, while plaque psoriasis and Crohn's disease drug Stelara missed.Drugs bought in the acquisition of Actelion Pharma broadly missed Novarro's forecast by $65 million. But the more ""important brands,"" Opsumit and Uptravi, brought in-line sales.Medical device sales of $6.97 billion topped Novarro's estimate by $60 million. Revenue from the consumer segment met Novarro's view for $3.54 billion.RELATED:Will Biotech Merger's 'Spigot' Turn On After Juno, Bioverativ?Which Biotech Stocks Could Surprise To The Upside On Earnings?This Biotech Stock Rocketed 15% On Rumors Biogen Could Buy It

36,PFE,"The major averages closed with heavy losses as the weeklong market slide came to an important test.X The Dow Jones industrial average led with a 4.6% loss, or nearly 1,200 points, after losing nearly 1,600 points earlier. The S&P 500 index lost 4.1%. Both indexes fell through their 50-day moving averages. A bounce from the line would be a positive sign. But if either index falls much below the 50-day line, the market could have even further to drop.The Nasdaq composite was off 3.8%, below its 50-day line. The composite had a better performance than the Dow and S&P in the hot January market rally.Volume was higher than at the same time Friday. Market breadth continued to deteriorate: Declining stocks led advancers by nearly 6-to-1 on the NYSE and 5-to-1 on the Nasdaq.Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) pressured the Dow industrials again. Both oil companies sold off Friday after their earnings reports. Exxon Mobil drilled down nearly 6% and pierced its 200-day moving average. Chevron lost 5.2% and is 15% below its January high.The two certainly aren't alone: The SPDR Energy ETF (XLE) is down 10% from its prior high and also falling below the 50-day line.Industry groups in the energy, building, health care and banking sectors were some of the weakest in today's market.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Pfizer (PFE), two Dow components that also have been selling off since reporting earnings, were off more than 5%. J&J fell below its 50-day line, while Pfizer violated the 20-day average.Most IBD 50 stocks were lower also, but some are holding up above the 50-day line. Fourteen of the 50 are trading below the 50-day moving average. Grubhub (GRUB) fell below its 50-day line Monday after Raymond James cut the rating to market perform from outperform. Earnings are due Thursday before the open.On average, the IBD 50 stocks are down more than 8% from their 52-week highs, an average that has been skewed lower by big decliners such as PetMed Express (PETS), Five Below (FIVE) and Daqo New Energy (DQ).In one breakout of note, Oppenheimer Holdings (OPY) briefly cleared the 28.85 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. Volume was more than double its average, and the relative strength line made a new high.

37,PFE,"Eli Lilly (LLY) issued strong 2018 guidance early Wednesday — following in the footsteps of AbbVie (ABBV) and Dow's Pfizer (PFE) — with an improved tax rate and earnings expectations after a fourth-quarter beat.X For 2018, Lilly called for an 18% tax rate, down from 20.5% in 2017. As a result, Lilly now sees adjusted income of $4.81-$4.91 per share, which would grow 12%-15% vs. 2017. Sales are expected to be $23 billion to $23.5 billion.Lilly cited U.S. tax legislation for the improved 2018 tax rate outlook. Adjusted earnings and sales guidance topped views for $4.65 and $23.19 billion, respectively.But Lilly stock dropped 5.4% to close at 81.45 on the stock market today. Collectively, drug stocks tumbled 2.2% a day after Amazon (AMZN), Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) pledged to cut down on U.S. health care costs.Evercore analyst Umer Raffat noted Lilly's animal health business disappointed. Sales of food animal products declined 8% to $547.4 million and widely missed expectations, he said in a report to clients.The miss stemmed from the U.S. where Lilly is facing competitive pressures for two products used in cattle: a milk supplement called Posilac and a nonsteroidal growth stimulant called Optaflexx.IBD'S TAKE: Lilly has an IBD Composite Rating of 80 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it outperforms eight in 10 stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to the IBD Stock Checkup for a look at other strong drug performers.Milk has been oversupplied in the market, depressing prices, Raffat said. Production has been strong and many customers are forgoing Posilac. Optaflexx is likely suffering from a rule under a U.S.-China export trade deal that the meat can't contain Optaflexx, he said.Outside animal health, there were very few misses, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a note to clients. Sales of plaque psoriasis drug Taltz, diabetes med Humulin and erectile dysfunction drug Cialis lagged the consensus.Still, total sales of $6.16 billion grew 7% year over year and beat the consensus for $5.96 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.14 a share increased 20% and topped analysts' view for $1.08.RELATED:Dow's Pfizer Tumbles With Drug Sector Despite Beat-And-RaiseAmazon Health Care Disruption Fears Clash With This RealityGilead Stock Broke Out On AbbVie's Earnings — Here's WhyWhy Valeant's 162% Climb Over Nine Months 'Makes No Sense'How This Biotech Stock Could Top Bigger Rivals In Preventing Migraines

38,PFE,"Sellers were in the stock market again Tuesday as the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq held stiff losses with less than one hour remaining in Tuesday's session.X The Dow took the biggest hit, falling 1.4%, hurt by weakness in Pfizer (PFE) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH). Pfizer's earnings disappointed, fueling a 3% loss for the stock. UnitedHealth Group gave back 4% on news from Amazon.com (AMZN), Berkshire Hathway (BRKA) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) that the three are collaborating on a way to offer health care to U.S. employees with more transparency and at a lower cost.Providers of pharmacy benefit management services fell hard on the news. Express Scripts (ESRX) cratered 3% but was well off session lows after touching the 50-day moving average. CVS Health (CVS) slumped 4%.Amazon bucked the trend, rising 0.7% to around 1,428 ahead of its earnings report Thursday after the close. The Leaderboard name has been a standout performer after a breakout over a 1,213.51 buy point.The S&P 500 lost 1% and the Nasdaq composite eased 0.8%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking higher than Monday's levels in the stock market today, more so on the NYSE. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 suffered a distribution day Monday with losses in higher volume. Distribution days are a sign of institutional selling.Workday (WDAY) was a bright spot in the Nasdaq 100, rising nearly 3% to 119.74. The weekly chart shows a conventional entry at 116.99, but the daily shows an earlier cup-with-handle entry of 114.98.Meanwhile, the two-day Fed meeting got underway today and a decision on interest rates is due Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. The market is not expecting a rate hike this time around, but the chances for one at the March meeting are pretty good. According to CME Group FedWatch, the market sees a 70% chance for a quarter-point hike to a range of 1.50% to 1.75% in March.The 10-year Treasury yield added 3 basis points to 2.72% ahead of Friday's jobs report. Economists expect nonfarm payrolls to rise 175,000 with the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.1%.Inside the IBD 50, Align Technology (ALGN), the company behind Invisalign braces, recovered off lows after a quick test of the 50-day moving average. Shares of Align were still down 3% ahead of its earnings report after the close.IBD 50 name Grubhub (GRUB) gapped down, falling nearly 4% to 72.50, after Barclays downgraded shares to equal weight from overweight with a 56 price target. The stock is about 4% below the 74.90 of a flat base it cleared last week. Earnings are due Feb. 8 before the open.Growth stocks were weak again as 16 names in the IBD 50 were down 2% or more in late trading.RELATED:Workday Rises, Veeva Upgraded On Margins, HubSpot Downgraded Health Care Stocks Tumble On Amazon, Berkshire, JPMorgan AllianceAmazon Scores Price Target Increase Ahead Of Fourth-Quarter ReportAlibaba Likely To Show Strongest Revenue Growth In 15 Quarters

Apple (AAPL) and Intel (INTC) advanced on the Dow Jones industrial average, though McDonald's (MCD) and Boeing (BA) weighed heavily.PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) was up 0.5%, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) was up 0.3% and SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) fell 0.5% in the stock market today. Small caps rallied with iShares Core S&P Small-Cap (IJR) and iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) up 1.6% each. QQQ is showing relative strength by finding support at its 50-day moving average.Biotech, oil explorers and semiconductors were among the biggest sector fund gainers. Health care stocks including Pfizer (PFE), Merck (MRK) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) advanced on the Dow Jones industrials. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) exchange-traded fund reversed sharply higher to a 2.5% gain.Also among blue chips, Apple (AAPL) reversed from an early loss to a slight gain, and was near the flat line. It continues to hold above its 50-day line and is 3% below a new record intraday high from earlier this week.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (IAU) were up 0.5% each, as gold prices rose 1.4% to $1,323.20 an ounce. Both ETFs are trying to hold support at their 50-day lines.Utilities, real estate and industrials underperformed.Technology wasn't spared in Thursday's stock market sell-off, but a leading ETF topped by the likes of Apple, Microsoft (MSFT) and Facebook (FB) is holding up better than most.SPDR Technology (XLK) extended its losses for a third straight session, getting close to a test of the 50-day moving average.However, it didn't breach the line the way many other ETFs did, though on Friday, it did. But it was finding support near the line. If it can stage a solid rebound off the line, it could set up a new chance to add or buy shares. An early-December bounce off the 50-day yielded an 11% gain to its Jan. 26 high. It was featured in this ETF column on Dec. 6.That said, all buys are riskier when the market uptrend is under pressure. So it's crucial to keep a close eye on how XLK and the broader market are faring before making any purchases. The ETF suffered a steep drop from the late-January high to its Feb. 9 low, so conditions haven't been exactly ideal.The $20.5 billion fund, which tracks the Technology Select Sector Index, marked its 20th anniversary in December. Software accounted for the biggest chunk of assets as of Feb. 28, at just over 21%, while internet software and services weighed in at 18% and tech hardware storage and peripherals at 17%. IT services and semiconductors or chip equipment were next at about 16% each.XLK's top five holdings were Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and class A and C shares of Alphabet (GOOGL). Those five represented 43% of the 71-stock portfolio. Apple has seen bullish news this week. Warren Buffett said on Monday he bought more shares of the iPhone maker than any other stock in the past year. Other reports showed Apple taking 87% of smartphone industry profits in Q4, and grabbing the lead in the wearable device market in Q4 and 2017.

Like the broader market, it endured a sharp sell-off to the 200-day line earlier this month before coming back to retake the 50-day line. It's not the best type of pullback to use for new buys, though. Shares rose 18% from an early-September bounce off the 50-day line to their Jan. 26 peak.The $3.2 billion fund, which tracks the Morningstar U.S. Dividend Growth Index, will mark its fourth anniversary in June. As the name implies, it targets U.S. stocks that have a track record of consistent dividend growth.

41,PFE,"The major stock indexes were poised to end the week on a high note as Wall Street found much to like about Intel's (INTC) earnings report.X The Dow Jones industrial average component gapped up at the open and recently traded as high as 49.83, up 11%. The chip bellwether is one of several large-cap tech names that has been forced to pivot to new markets for growth; no easy task for a company like Intel with a market capitalization of around $232 billion.Among the highlights of Intel's report is that sales at its data-center business rose 20% to $5.58 billion, making up nearly one-third of total sales in the quarter.In late-afternoon trading, the Nasdaq composite was up 0.9%, the S&P 500 added 0.8% and the Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.5%. The S&P 500 is set to notch its 17th weekly gain in the past 20 weeks.Volume on the NYSE was tracking lower than Thursday's levels in the stock market today. Nasdaq volume was on pace to be a touch higher.Pfizer (PFE) was another strong gainer in the Dow, up 4.5% to an all-time high ahead of Tuesday's earnings report. (Read more about Pfizer in IBD's The Income Investor feature.)Top gainers in the Nasdaq 100 included chip firm Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM). Shares jumped more than 5% to 58.71. Shares pulled back along with other chip stocks Thursday, falling 2% and revisiting a 55.43 buy point in a flat base that serves as part of a base on base chart pattern.Leaderboard name JD.com (JD) also did well in the Nasdaq 100, rising nearly 6% to 50.03. It cleared a cup-with-handle base this week with a 47.50 buy point.In economic news, the first estimate for Q4 U.S. GDP growth came in at 2.6%, a little below the consensus estimate of 2.9%. Despite the headline miss, consumer spending and business investment still rose nicely.Thor Industries (THO) and Winnebago Industries (WGO), two leading RV makers, fell sharply for the second straight session, down 9% each, after Northcoast Research downgraded both to neutral from buy. Both stocks plunged below their 10-week moving average lines this week in heavy volume, an unequivocal sell signal for those that bought when both stocks broke out of bases in September.Dell Technologies (DVMT) also lagged badly, plunging 7.5% on reports the company is considering a public share offering or perhaps a possible transaction with cloud computing and visualization software maker VMware (VMW). Dell is a majority owner of VMware. VMware was off session highs but still soared 10%.Inside the IBD 50, small-cap MiMedx (MDXG) extended gains in a big way after Thursday's breakout over a 15.43 cup-with-handle buy point.

42,PFE,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) has climbed 162% since hitting its 2017 low, but shares tumbled Wednesday after an analyst suggested their rise over the past nine months ""makes no sense.""X ""We believe the movement is a confluence of factors that have little to do with underlying factors, and have much more to do with perceptions surrounding liquidity/bankruptcy risk,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond said in a note to clients.In short, the underlying dynamics mean Valeant is still in trouble, he said.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Valeant toppled 10.9% to finish at 19.88. Shares have been on a run since breaking out of a cup-with-handle base with a 15.84 buy point in late November. This month alone Valeant was up 7% as of Tuesday's close.Short interest now stands under 9% compared with a 2017 high of 16%, he said. That could be related the fact Valeant also has no long-term debt maturities in 2018 and 2019. But it has maturities of $2.7 billion, $3.2 billion and $5.3 billion in 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively.""Liquidity risk is likely off the table for now,"" he said. ""That however does not mean that the dynamics surrounding the business have changed.""U.S. prescription volumes in Valeant's dermatology, brand eye care and legacy segments show declines of 30%, 15% and 12%, respectively, in 2017 vs. 2016, Raymond said. Each of these units is facing payer pressure and loss of exclusivities for key drugs.Further, it appears antibacterial Xifaxan is maturing, he said. Xifaxan is approved to treat traveler's diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea and hepatic encephalopathy, a condition that occurs in patients with liver dysfunction.IBD'S TAKE: Valeant has an IBD Composite Rating of 66 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it outperforms more than six in 10 stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But it still lags leaders like AbbVie with a CR of 98. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at other top-rated drug stocks.Xifaxan accounted for 13% of sales in the third quarter and is likely near 20% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, Raymond said. That means its gross margins are likely in the 90% range.The pressure is on for Xifaxan, which is the most important revenue driver for Valeant, Raymond said. It requires only a small specialty salesforce to reach the gastroenterology community and hospital settings.""As such, this is the one topline driver that must continue to demonstrate a steady track record in order for anxiety regarding liquidity/bankruptcy risk not to reemerge,"" he said.But Xifaxan is also soon to face competition from Cosmo Pharmaceuticals' Aemcolo. Cosmo is aiming to file for approval of Aemcolo in traveler's diarrhea in the near-term and could enter the market before the end of the year.In new launches, Valeant is entering the glaucoma space with Vyzulta, which will rival Aerie Pharmaceuticals' (AERI) Rhopressa. Other players include Dow stock Pfizer (PFE), Allergan (AGN) and Novartis (NVS). Competition is likely to result in a wide spread between gross and net sales for Vyzulta.Valeant is also launching Siliq to treat plaque psoriasis. But physician feedback suggests the go-to treatments in that drug class will be Novartis' Cosentyx and Eli Lilly's (LLY) Taltz.""We do not believe these are opportunities that are significant enough to drive sustainable EBITDA growth,"" he said. ""Quite the contrary, we continue to believe that the loss of exclusivities and payer pressure will continue to be headwinds.""Raymond reiterated his underperform rating and 12 price target on Valeant.RELATED:Novartis Tops A High After Crushing Fourth-Quarter EarningsAbbott Spikes To Record After Topping Quarterly ExpectationsWhy These 3 Biotech Stocks Could Outperform Their Peers In 2018

43,PFE,"Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Mylan (MYL) were among a group of generic-drug makers hit Thursday after a consortium of hospitals said they would make medicines themselves to circumvent rising drug prices.X An estimated 300 hospital groups are involved in the effort, which would create a nonprofit company to provide generic medicines to hospitals, according to the New York Times. The goal is to avoid rising drug prices and medicine shortages.On the stock market today, generic stocks collectively dipped 1.3% after falling 2.7% in earlier trades. Shares of Teva fell 3.6% to close at 20.71, while Mylan lost 0.6% to 46.51. Others that tumbled include Lannett (LCI), down 4.4% to close at 23.65 while Aclaris Therapeutics (ACRS) dipped 0.6% to 24.26 and Ani Pharmaceuticals (ANIP) dove nearly 2% to 69.74.Hospitals have struggled with shortages of drugs like morphine, sodium bicarbonate and saline. Last April, the Department of Justice served subpoenas to a number of firms, including Pfizer (PFE) and Baxter (BAX), relating to a saline shortage in 2013-14.Drugmakers have been on the political hook for rising prices, particularly those of older, off-patent drugs. Martin Shkreli, former head of Turing Pharmaceutical, drew ire for buying a drug used in AIDS patients and spiking the price to $750 per tablet from $13.50.IBD'S TAKE: Ani Pharma leads the 17-company generic drugs industry group with an IBD Composite Rating of 96 out of a best-possible 99. That means it outperforms most stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at other strongly rated drug stocks.Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) became a Wall Street superstar before crashing and burning in 2016 and early 2017. Its bought older drugs and then raised prices on them. Valeant stock is up nearly 167% since hitting a bottom in April 2017, though shares dipped 2.6% to 22.10 Thursday.In 2016, a number of generic-drug makers became the subject of an antitrust investigation into the prices of an antibiotic and a diabetes medicines.RELATED:Beware: Price Wars For Big Pharma, Biotech Companies On HorizonGeneric Drug Makers Face Pricing Issues That Other Pharmas Don'tWill Trump Break With Republicans And Push Major Drug Price Reform?

44,PFE,"This year is shaping up to be boisterous for biotech acquisitions after Celgene (CELG) and Sanofi (SNY), in a matter of days, announced plans to spend north of $25 billion to take over three companies, analysts say.X Celgene and Sanofi, in particular, are facing challenges in areas where insurance companies are pushing back on payments in rheumatology and diabetes. That also leaves the likes of Novo Novartis (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY) in trouble, said Brad Loncar, who manages an immunotherapy-based fund.""These companies have to buy growth,"" Loncar told Investor's Business Daily. ""They've been growing their revenue doing artificial things whether that's drug price increases, tax inversions or some kind of other type of financial engineering. Those things are going away.""In all of 2017, there was $50 billion spent in biotech deals, Mizuho analyst Salim Syed told IBD. This year, so far Celgene has said it would spend $9 billion to buy the remainder of Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) it doesn't already own. Sanofi is spending $11.6 billion and $4.8 billion to acquire Bioverativ (BIVV) and Ablynx (ABLX).""For companies who haven't bought anything, it's just a matter of opportunity,"" Syed said.The buying spree kicked off in August when Gilead Sciences (GILD) announced its plan to acquire cancer play Kite Pharma for $11.9 billion. Gilead has been suffering from a major slowdown in hepatitis C drug sales amid high cure rates and saturation in the U.S. and Europe.Celgene and Sanofi announced their plans to acquire Juno and Bioverativ on the same day in January. Days later, Sanofi said it would buy rare disease drugmaker Ablynx.For Celgene, the acquisition followed a disappointing third quarter in which sales of psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis drug Otezla widely missed expectations. The biotech also cut its 2020 guidance on Otezla's shortfall and after terminating several trials in Crohn's disease.Loncar described Celgene's long-term growth prospects at the time as a ""bleak picture."" It's also facing a patent cliff in the mid-2020s for its cancer drug Revlimid.IBD'S TAKE: It's challenging holding on to a stock amid a market correction as it declines. But that could help shares form a new potential base. Is it still possible to capture a big gain? Head to the Investor's Corner for four tips on how to make gains during a correction.""So they really couldn't afford to wait,"" he said.Sanofi, on the other hand, was skunked twice in 2016 and 2017 as it tried to acquire Medivation and Actelion Pharma. Dow component Pfizer (PFE) beat out Sanofi for Medivation and Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) was able to acquire Actelion out from under Sanofi.Roy Behren, a fund manager for Westchester Capital Management, says Sanofi committed a faux pas in both acquisitions — it made a hostile bid for Medivation and went back on an initially higher bid for Actelion, filings show.""Hostile approaches are generally unsuccessful in this space because of the fact the scientists are such an important part of the value equation,"" he told IBD. ""In the case of Sanofi and Medivation, they couldn't arrive at a price unless it was friendly. It was very difficult to complete the acquisition.""Among the high profile acquisitions in late 2017 and early 2018, the acquirers have suffered from pressure on sales of key moneymakers. That, along with tax reform allowing companies to pay less in corporate taxes and repatriate cash at a lower rate, could prime the pump for acquisitions.""I'm a strong believer this is going to be a huge year for acquisitions,"" Loncar said. ""No. 1, for larger companies, their growth is slowing, and No. 2, this tax reform deal adds fuel to that fire. It makes it easier for them to do these deals.""Novo Nordisk lost out on Ablynx to Sanofi. Now, Loncar expects Novo Nordisk to go after other assets to contend with its deep exposure to the diabetes market. Lilly, too, is seeing challenges in diabetes. Meanwhile, Amgen's (AMGN) older drugs are facing new competition.""All big companies really need to do this,"" he said.But there are outliers, Mizuho analyst Syed said. Biogen (BIIB), for instance, guided to flat 2018 sales for its multiple sclerosis unit, including the impact of a royalty it will get on revenue from Roche's (RHHBY) new drug Ocrevus.""There's this perception that the franchises are dwindling,"" he said. ""That's the argument that investors make for a lot of these guys like Biogen, like Amgen — that their base business is going away. That's not necessarily the case. Biogen is stable for 2018.""Still, flat sales won't be enough to pique investor interest. Biogen's aducanumab, a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease, is a ""carrot"" for investors until clinical trial data is available toward the end of 2019 or early 2020.""But as long as that carrot is out there, it becomes really difficult for the hedge fund community to short the stock,"" he said. ""Aducanumab can produce returns — if it works — that large-cap biotechs typically don't see.""Westchester's Behren notes biotechs seem to be fairly interested in immunotherapies and oncology. That includes Gilead's acquisition of Kite and Celgene's plan to acquire Juno. Both are working on drugs known as CAR-T therapies, which teach the immune system to identify and fight cancer.""There has been a lot of activity in the oncology space in terms of immunotherapies,"" he said. ""The larger companies are trying to gobble up any promising technology they can while it's still affordable. We are also seeing quite a few testing companies being acquired.""Celgene's acquisition of Juno followed a common storyline, Behren said. Celgene invested in Juno in 2015 to create immunotherapies in cancer and autoimmune diseases. The duo is furthest along with JCAR017, a potential treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.When Celgene pulled the trigger on Juno on Jan. 22, it made sense that it was at a 28% premium to Juno's closing price on the prior trading day.""Biotechs — even more than high tech — tend to come at significant premiums to trading prices,"" he said. ""That's because they're somewhat risky, but could be a huge payoff in the event they're successful.""Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) could be amid a similar plot. In September 2016, the duo paired up to test Nektar's drug called NKTR-214 with Bristol's Opdivo in patients with melanoma, kidney cancer and lung cancer. In November, Nektar presented strong early data from the combos.Loncar pegged Nektar as a potential takeover target in 2018, calling NKTR-214 ""revolutionary."" Days later, Bristol announced it would pay Nektar $1.85 billion upfront — comprised of $1 billion in cash and the purchase of 2.28 million shares — to test NKTR-214 with Opdivo and Opdivo plus Yervoy.The deal allows Bristol to remain the leader in immuno-oncology/immuno-oncology combinations without risking a $16 billion bid on Nektar, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in a Feb. 14 note to clients.""I have no doubt (Nektar's) phone has been ringing off the hook since (November) because their data was so interesting,"" Loncar said. ""If someone is bold enough to buy them, it could put the acquirer into a class of their own in immuno-oncology.""Drugs called PARP inhibitors also look interesting, Loncar said. Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and Tesaro (TSRO) both have drugs approved in this class and are small enough to acquire. AstraZeneca (AZN) also works in that space.Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT), Neurocrine Biosciences (NBIX) and BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) have also had successful launches recently.""If a company wants revenue growth, buy a rare-disease drug,"" he said. ""They have the best sales ramps. I think those types of companies are really interesting right now. I wouldn't be surprised if some of them get bought out.""RELATED:Biotech Investors Flee In Droves As Market Correction Rocks The GroupThese Biotechs Could Spring Back After Market Correction: AnalystWhy These 3 Biotech Stocks Could Outperform Their Peers In 2018

46,PFE,"When Miles White was named CEO of Abbott Laboratories (ABT) in 1998 at 43, he was the youngest head of a major health care company.Today, he's one of the longest-serving chiefs in health care and has made a reputation as a master strategist, known for making bold moves at Abbott. And none was more dramatic than when he spun off the research-based pharmaceutical half of the firm as AbbVie (ABBV) in 2013. Before this, Abbott had a market capitalization at about half that of industry leaders Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK).It seemed crazy to many, but White perceived that developing new drugs had a completely different business rhythm than what the new Abbott would now focus on: devices, diagnostics, nutritional products and branded generic drugs. The result: Abbott's stock has since risen from 24 a share to around 59 a share, giving it a market cap of about $102 billion, while AbbVie's shares increased from 33 a share to near 100 a share, giving it a value approaching $159 billion. His creations combined are now worth around $260 billion, far more than Pfizer ($217 billion) or Merck ($156 billion). And White has been ranked by Barron's as one of the world's 30 best CEOs for nine straight years.""It's about keeping the company current and relevant,"" White told IBD. ""We continually shape our business to ensure we're where the needs and opportunities are for the future. For instance, our recent acquisition of St. Jude Medical makes us a leader across a range of growing medical device categories where new technology can make a huge difference — for the patient and for investors.""White grew up in Las Vegas and earned a Bachelor of Science in mechanical engineering at Stanford in 1978, and an MBA two years later. He joined McKinsey & Co. in Chicago as a consultant, but while he felt the work was fascinating, projects and clients came and went. White said he wanted something he ""could feel connected to for a longer term, which would be more fulfilling.""White was hired by Abbott, based in the north Chicago suburb of Abbott Park, Ill., in 1984 as a director of sales in diagnostics, and four years later he was offered a chance to head the division's growing Asia-Pacific region — a prestigious position for a 33-year-old. But he turned it down because it meant moving to Japan; his wife wanted to open a children's bookstore in the U.S. White said he is a big believer in work-life balance and was confident that other opportunities for advancement would come his way. Indeed, 10 years later he was chosen to be the new CEO and the following year added the title of chairman of the board. (And his wife ran her bookstore for 19 years before selling it in 2008.) Abbott had rarely done acquisitions or divestitures since its founding in 1888. A whirlwind of change followed after White took the helm, including:But 2007 was dramatic and traumatic. Abbott acquired Kos Pharmaceuticals, a maker of cardiovascular drugs, for $3.7 billion in cash, but a deal to sell its core laboratory and point-of-care diagnostics divisions to General Electric (GE) fell through. White decided to revive these challenged divisions instead, investing in research and development, streamlining operations, and reorganizing products and services into a new diagnostics division. In August 2016 it began launching a family of next-generation instruments, informatics and services with common software and hardware platforms designed to be easy to use and more efficient, which White called ""a game-changer for the industry.""Among other acquisitions, in 2010 Abbott paid $6.2 billion for the pharmaceuticals unit of Belgium-based Solvay, expanding its presence in emerging markets. The same year, a plan was announced to purchase a unit of Piramal Healthcare for $3.8 billion, which would make Abbott the biggest pharmaceutical company in India.The success of the company's acquisitions may largely depend on an ability to anticipate consumers' medical needs, understand where the practice of medicine is headed, and aggressively position the company to benefit through internal and external investment.""It's not just about acquiring companies,"" White said. ""It's about what you do with them. How can you do more with that business? How can you make it better? How can it improve your existing operations?""We've developed a very disciplined integration process through which we learn how best to bring new assets into Abbott and help them expand and reach their potential, faster and better than they could have before.""All of this and more were just preliminaries to spinning off half the company, for which Abbott took a 2012 third-quarter charge of $478 million. AbbVie was officially listed on the New York Stock Exchange on Jan. 2, 2013.""What makes White such a savvy deal-maker?"" asked Jim Cramer on his ""Mad Money"" show on CNBC in November 2017. ""He has a real talent for anticipating consumers' future medical needs and then aggressively positioning his company to benefit from them. Within four years of becoming CEO, Abbott released Humira, which would go on to treat forms of arthritis, plaque psoriasis and Crohn's disease, among other ailments. In 2016, now part of AbbVie, it made $16.1 billion in sales, making it the best-selling drug in the world. But White had the foresight to spin off this part of his company ahead of the explosion of the debate about drug prices.""But guiding a global enterprise through massive change can result in mistakes, and Abbott's biggest occurred in the midst of the drama leading to the split. In October 2012, Abbott was fined $500 million for marketing Depakote, a brand of valproic acid, the world's most widely prescribed anti-epileptic drug, for conditions not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. As part of a settlement that cost it a total of $1.5 billion, the company agreed to strengthen its internal controls.After separating from AbbVie in January 2013, the new Abbott emerged with a focus on not only diagnostic products and services, but medical devices, nutritional lines and branded generic medicines. The latter is the Established Pharmaceuticals Division, which sells to developing markets, where a brand name may be trusted more than an unknown, due to high quality and efficacy standards, but which doesn't have the high costs of R&D-based pharma. The division now offers more than 1,500 products, with 400 in development. In 2014, it acquired CFR Pharmaceuticals for $2.9 billion, more than doubling its Latin American branded-generics pharmaceutical presence.Abbott is also the world leader in adult nutritional products, including Ensure and ZonePerfect, as well as the U.S. leader in baby nutrition with Similac and other lines, and for special dietary needs with Glucerna and Juven.The company is also a leader in diabetes care, introducing a revolutionary continuous glucose monitoring device, FreeStyleLibre, in September.In 2017, the company purchased St. Jude Medical for $25 billion in cash and stock, establishing Abbott as a leader in the medical device arena. It also closed Alere for $5.3 billion, which made it the leader in the $7 billion point-of-care diagnostics market.""We've reinvented the company multiple times over the past 20 years,"" White said. ""It's a continuous process of shaping the company for the future. We work very deliberately to ensure that we remain relevant and current to the people we serve and to the changes taking place in our environment. We're in several different businesses today than we were decades ago, and they were all chosen specifically for their relevance to where the science was going, where demographic and socioeconomic factors were going, and where our customers were going. And that's why we're still growing strong and our stock is at an all-time high.""Today, Abbott employs 94,000 workers in over 150 countries. In 2016, its revenue was $20.9 billion and net income was $1.4 billion.CEO and chairman of Abbott Laboratories, a global leader in medical devices, diagnostics, nutritional products and branded generic medicines.Overcame: The failed sale of the challenged diagnostics businesses, which he turned around by investing in innovation and becoming a highly profitable, consistent grower for the company.Lesson: Envision a long-term big goal and work out the detailed steps to get there, even if it means defying the industry's consensus.""You need to continually ask yourself, 'Is there a better way?' Because the answer is always yes, even though exactly how might not yet be apparent.""MORE ABOUT LEADERS & SUCCESS:Pam Nicholson Drives Global Growth For Enterprise HoldingsTaco Bell's Founder Changed America's Fast-Food MenuMeet The Man Hired To Take On AmazonPhil Knight Cleared Hurdles To Make Nike A Merchandising Champion

49,PFE,"Count Pfizer among the best dividend stocks in the stock market. Not only because of a stout dividend yield of 3.7% but also because of strong performance of new drugs.The best dividend stocks often show a consistent track record of dividend payouts. Pfizer (PFE) certainly passes muster here.Earlier this month, the company declared a quarterly dividend of 34 cents a share. The dividend is payable June 1 to shareholders of record May 11. It's Pfizer's 318th consecutive quarterly dividend.Long known for its blockbuster drugs like Lipitor, Viagra and Xanax, Pfizer's fourth-quarter earnings report showed strong performance from other drugs.In the company's Innovate Health unit, strength was driven by Ibrance, Eliquis and Xeljanz.

Procter & Gamble (PG) was in talks with Pfizer to buy the unit for around $15 billion. But the two couldn't agree on a price.Pfizer made headlines earlier this month when it inked an accord with privately held Allogene Therapeutics. The partnership will help Pfizer compete with Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Novartis (NVS) in advanced cancer treatments using CAR-T therapy. CAR-T therapy is when patients' own immune cells are used to treat their cancer. Pfizer and Allogen aim to create an allogenic version of CAR-T therapy, using healthy donor cells.Earnings from Pfizer are due May 1 before the open.RELATED:Biotech And Pharma Industry Stock NewsBest Income Stocks To Buy And Watch

50,PFE,"Plunging shares of Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) weighed on generic drug stocks Thursday after sales and profits continued to drop and it offered weak 2018 guidance, all on top of word of a potential delay for its key migraine drug.X For the fourth quarter, Teva brought in adjusted profit of 93 cents per share on $5.46 billion in sales, declining 32.6% and 15.9%, respectively. Sales of multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone declined 19% to $821 million amid growing generic competition.For the year, Teva sees adjusted profit of $2.25-$2.50 per share on $18.3 billion to $18.8 billion in sales, lagging the consensus for $2.93 and $19.17 billion, respectively. Teva's outlook reflects the likelihood of increasing challenges.""Management noted that roughly half that decline reflects the impact of the loss of exclusivity on Copaxone 40 milligrams,"" Piper Jaffray analyst David Amsellem said in a note to clients. ""A significant chunk of the decline also, and not surprisingly, reflects continued pressure in the U.S. generics business.""By the closing bell on the stock market today, Teva plunged 10.6% to close at 18.64 though earlier it fell as much as 12.6%. Generic drug stocks collectively dipped 3%.Analysts say rival Mylan's (MYL) new Copaxone generic is priced at a 30% discount to Teva's branded drug. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) is delayed, but Momenta Pharmaceuticals (MNTA) and Novartis (NVS) unit Sandoz should have a 40-milligram generic on the market this year after a Pfizer (PFE) manufacturing facility passed its re-inspection.Generic drug sales fell 16% year over year to $3.11 billion. In 2017, Teva recorded $17.1 billion in goodwill impairments related to its U.S. generics business. Pricing pressure, government regulation, accelerated generic approvals in the U.S. and delays in launches continue to be challenges.While sales were down, Teva profits and revenue both topped the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for adjusted profit of 81 cents a share on $5.3 billion in sales. Copaxone sales also beat the consensus view for $611 million, Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler said in a note to clients. Still, she expects another generic entrant in mid-2018.IBD'S TAKE: Teva's Relative Strength Rating has been on the rise this month. It now has an RS Rating of 86 out of a best-possible 99. See what goes into that rating by visiting IBD Data Stories.Further, Teva said the manufacturer of the active pharmaceutical ingredient used in its migraine drug, fremanezumab, received a warning letter from the Food and Drug Administration regarding the fill/finish part of its facility. This means fremanezumab could be delayed.Fremanezumab is currently set to go before the FDA in June. The drug belongs to a class known as anti-CGRPs, which aim to prevent migraines. Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR), Amgen (AMGN) and Eli Lilly (LLY) are all working on drugs in this class.""This is another source of anxiety surrounding a business that simply cannot afford to have additional missteps, particularly in the context of a highly competitive anti-CGRP/migraine space,"" Amsellem said.RELATED:Sanofi, Regeneron Dip As Eczema Drug Dupixent Lags In EuropeCan CRISPR And These 3 Small Biotechs Cure 10,000 Diseases?These Biotechs Could Spring Back After Market Correction: Analyst

51,PFE,"The S&P 500 index and other major averages had their first down week of 2018, and it was their worst showing in two years. Apple (AAPL) guided lower, as many suspected. Amazon (AMZN) and Boeing (BA) delivered strong results while Facebook (FB) touted strong ad rates. Alibaba (BABA) missed on earnings. PayPal (PYPL) crashed as former parent eBay (EBAY) moved to cut ties. A move by Amazon, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) to team up to tackle health care costs hit insurers and pharmacy benefit managers. The Bitcoin meltdown continuedX After a hot start to 2018, the major averages suffered their worst weekly losses in two years, with the S&P 500 down 3.9%, the Dow 4.1% and the Nasdaq 3.5% as rising bond yields worldwide pressured stocks. UnitedHealth (UNH), CVS Health (CVS) and many other insurers fell on an Amazon-JPMorgan-Berkshire health care joint venture. Amazon, Boeing and Facebook were earnings winners, Alibaba was a notable loser, while Apple (AAPL) did OK.Bitcoin plummeted below $8,000 as 2018 losses accelerate as Facebook joined a chorus of regulators worldwide cracking down on cryptocurrencies.Apple (AAPL) earnings per share rose 16% year over year, on sales of $88.3 billion, up 13%, for the fiscal first quarter. Both narrowly beat expectations. Apple sold 77.3 million iPhones vs. the consensus for 80 million units, but average selling prices due to its new iPhone X and iPhone 8 models fueled overall results. For the March quarter, Apple expects sales of $61 billion, based on the midpoint of guidance, below official estimates for $65.4 billion. Shares fell 4.3% on Friday to a new three-month low.The e-commerce leader reported adjusted earnings of $3.75 a share, smashing the consensus of $1.85. A big benefit from tax cuts helped. Revenue rose 38% to $60.5 billion, also beating. Revenue from Amazon Web Services rose 46% to $5.1 billion. Sales of its Echo line of smart speakers far exceed expectations, Amazon (AMZN) said. Shares gained 3%, hitting a new high intraday.Facebook (FB) reported robust earnings and revenue growth that topped Q4 forecasts. User growth cooled while users' time spent on Facebook fell, even before its latest big News Feed changes. But executives said on the conference call that ad rates are soaring, easing analysts' revenue fears. Shares hit a record high Thursday.Alphabet (GOOGL) shares fell after the Google parent reported Q4 adjusted earnings were $9.70 a share, up 28% from a year earlier, missing views. Traffic acquisition costs, what Google pays partner websites to carry ads, soared 33% to $6.45 billion. Google expects the rise in TAC to moderate after Q1. Google's rising TAC has been linked to a contract renewal with Apple as well as internet searches shifting to mobile phones. Revenue rose 24% to $32.32 billion, topping consensus. The adjusted EPS excluded the impact of tax reform, which resulted in additional expense of $9.9 billion.Amazon's Jeff Bezos, JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon and Berkshire's Warren Buffett said the new nonprofit company is aimed at reducing costs for their employees. But if they are successful with their own firms, the thinking is that they would expand the services to corporate America. Health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers sold off. UnitedHealth, the largest U.S. health insurer and also a PBM, sank 6.7%. Drugstore-and-PBM CVS Health (CVS), which is buying insurer Aetna (AET), lost 6.8%. Pure-play PBM Express Scripts (ESRX) retreated 5.9%.PayPal (PYPL) reported strong earnings and in-line guidance, while former parent eBay (EBAY) reported in-line Q4 earnings but stronger-than-expected gross merchandise volume. But the real news was that eBay stunned Wall Street with the news that it will replace PayPal in 2020 and handle payments on its own site via a partnership with Adyen. The move will add a revenue stream. Shares of eBay soared nearly 14% on Thursday. PayPal lost 10.4% for the week, closing below a buy point and its 50-day line.The Chinese e-commerce giant's revenue soared 56% to $12.8 billion, the best gain in at least 15 quarters and beating views. Earnings per U.S. share climbed 25%, but slightly missed forecasts. Alibaba will buy a 33% stake in Ant Financial, a former unit that runs payments service Alipay. That replaces a deal in which Alibaba got 37.5% of Ant Financial's pretax profit. Alibaba will provide some intellectual property but not cash. The move clears hurdles for a possible Ant Financial IPO. Alibaba shares 8.7% for the week, tumbling below a recent buy point.The U.S. added 200,000 jobs in January, better than expected. Average hourly wages surged 2.9% vs. a year earlier, far above views and the best since 2009. The ISM manufacturing index continued to point to raid employment gains. While fast growth and wage gains are good news, they could spur the Federal Reserve to raise rates more aggressively this year.The software leader reported adjusted earnings per share of 96 cents, up 20% year over year, on sales of $28.9 billion, up 12%, for its fiscal second quarter. Analysts expected 86 cents and $28.4 billion. Microsoft got a lift from its cloud computing businesses, including Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics. For the current quarter, Microsoft guided to earnings per share of 83 cents on sales of $25.6 billion, above views. Shares hit a record high intraday Thursday.AMD (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO) and Qorvo (QRVO) offered investors positive financial news. AMD beat Wall Street's targets for the December quarter and guided estimates higher for the current quarter. Broadcom gave preliminary sales and earnings guidance for its fiscal first quarter that topped views. Qorvo rocketed after disclosing a big contract win with major customer Apple (AAPL) for its next-generation iPhone. Qorvo delivered better-than-expected results for its fiscal Q3, but guided well below Wall Street's targets for the current quarter.Boeing (BA) reported EPS of $4.80 a share, or $3.06 excluding a $1.74 per-share benefit from tax cuts. Either way, Boeing beat analyst views for $2.91. Revenue climbed 9% to $25.37 billion, also topping views. Boeing also guided 2018 EPS and revenue forecasts higher. Tax cuts will spur more investment and makes the case for new midmarket jet more compelling. Boeing also got a $6.6 billion missile defense contract from the Pentagon. UPS (UPS) ordered 14 new 747 jets, giving the venerable jumbo jet a new lifeline. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin (LMT) EPS jumped 32% to $4.30 while revenue rose 10% to $15.1 billion. The defense giant guided 2018 EPS views higher.Boeing shares rose 1.7% this week and Lockheed 2.25%, both hitting new highs.Video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) saw its stock surge to a record high after reporting big gains in online services associated with its sports game franchises FIFA and Madden NFL. The boost in Live Services was revealed as part of EA's in-line December-quarter earnings report. Video game hardware and software firm Nintendo (NTDOY) posted better-than-expected December-quarter results thanks to the continued success of its Switch console and related software. Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) announced a major delay to its highly anticipated Wild West action game ""Red Dead Redemption 2,"" now set for release on Oct. 26 instead of this spring.Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) topped analyst forecasts, as people broke out the plastic more often to spend during the holidays. Visa also OK'd a $7.5 billion buyback. That follows American Express (AXP), which just suspended its buyback. Visa also hiked its quarterly cash dividend to 21 cents a share.Homebuilder stocks continued to struggle even as some big builders reported better-than-expected earnings after the prior week's surprise miss by NVR (NVR). Housing demand and prices are strong, but concerns are growing over rising labor and material costs. Mortgage rates, though low, are rising. America's largest homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI) beat on both EPS and revenue Wednesday, but shares met resistance at their 50-day line. PulteGroup (PHM) stock kept falling on sliding gross margins, even though earnings and sales topped views. Smaller Meritage Homes (MTH) also beat while smaller M/I Homes (MHO)  and M.D.C. Holdings (MDC) missed on EPS.A slew of biotechs and drugmakers reported earnings, including Pfizer (PFE), Eli Lilly (LLY), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Merck (MRK), all of which topped Wall Street's fourth-quarter earnings expectations. Pfizer came in with $13.7 billion in sales and adjusted profit of 62 cents per share. Lilly's total sales grew 7% to $6.16 billion and the firm brought in adjusted income of $1.14 per share. Vertex reported sales of $651.6 million and adjusted profit of 61 cents per share. AstraZeneca reported core earnings of $1.30 per share and $5.78 billion in sales. Merck's results were mixed with $10.43 billion on the top line missing views, but adjusted income of 98 cents per share beat by 4 cents. Amgen (AMGN) reported $5.8 billion in sales and adjusted earnings of $2.89 per share, lagging the consensus. In merger news, Sanofi (SNY) announced it would acquire Ablynx (ABLX) for $4.8 billion.Exxon Mobil (XOM) fell well short of consensus while fellow Dow industrials component Chevron (CVX) also missed EPS views. Both shares plunged below their 50-day lines, with Chevron undercutting a recent buy point. Separately, U.S. crude production continues to hit fresh longtime highs, while crude supplies rose for the first time in 11 weeks. Crude futures remain near three-year highs.Ferrari (RACE) gapped into a buy zone after reporting strong earnings Thursday. Meanwhile, U.S. auto sales slumped in January, with big declines from Ford (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU). GM (GM) sales edged higher, but missed views. Toyota (TM) sales skyrocketed on strong truck sales.

52,PFE,"An agreement by Dow Jones component Pfizer (PFE) to defer drug price increases in an effort to play nice with President Donald Trump led analysts Wednesday to question what the fallout of the drug giant's action would be for the industry.Analysts wondered whether other pharmaceutical companies would follow Pfizer's example. Though, notably, Celgene (CELG) is still going ahead with 5% increases for blockbuster cancer drugs Revlimid and Pomalyst, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said in a report.""Pfizer's unprecedented reversal of its early July price increases marks tangible administrative influence,"" Morgan Stanley analyst David Risinger said in his report to clients. He noted Pfizer is awaiting more details from a so-called blueprint to tug down drug prices in the U.S.Late Tuesday, Pfizer said Chief Executive Ian Read had an extensive discussion with Trump, leading the company to back off price increases on drugs that had been effective July 1. Earlier in the week, Trump attacked Pfizer and others for raising ""drug prices for no reason.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Pfizer shares the president's concern for patients and commitment to providing affordable access to the medicines they need,"" Read said in a written statement. He also noted Pfizer had committed $5 billion of capital to expand manufacturing in the U.S.But not everyone jived with Pfizer's and Trump's announcements.Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., called on Pfizer and the Trump administration to reveal the details of the arrangement that led Pfizer to back off drug prices increases.""Secret, sweetheart arrangements with Big Pharma companies are exactly why America's drug pricing system is broken,"" he tweeted. ""Trump and his Admin are busy trying to score cheap PR points why Pharma (companies) continue to raise prices by DOUBLE digits.""Pfizer stock dipped 0.6% at the close, to 37.21. Broadly, shares of pharmaceutical companies fell about the same amount on the stock market today.Trump renewed his pledge in May to lower the cost of prescription medicine in the U.S. At the time, analysts largely said the proposed blueprint appeared to be more rhetoric than reform.Morgan Stanley's Risinger believes Pfizer's U.S. price increase reversal could have slightly negative implications for the second-quarter earnings season. He notes Pfizer's updated guidance commentary will be key later this month.""In addition, the news could put a near-term damper on future price increase action by other pharma-bio companies,"" he said. ""But Pfizer indicated that its action is temporary since it only committed to keeping prices unchanged through the end of 2018.""Other pharmaceutical companies could also rethink their 2019 guidance, he said.""Whether manufacturers limit themselves to one price increase per year or hold off entirely on customary January increases is key swing factor to earnings which we think is underestimated by the market,"" he said.Even Celgene's price increases for Revlimid and Pomalyst remain in line with 2018 medical inflation of 5.3%, RBC's Abrahams said. They are also below historical increases. Meanwhile, Gilead Sciences (GILD) joined Pfizer and walked back on planned price increases, he noted.""We see this more reserved price increase and increased transparency as potentially tempering headline risk and public scrutiny, as has been experienced by Pfizer, and it's in line with our view that companies will self-police in price increases to a much larger degree from now on,"" he said.Also Wednesday, Pfizer announced it would split its business into three distinct units in 2019 as it contends with looming losses of exclusivity. Under the restructuring, Pfizer's Innovative Medicines division will include biosimilars, anti-infection drugs and sterile injectables. Its Established Medicines unit will include off-patent branded and generic drugs, Finally, the company's Consumer Healthcare branch will hold all over-the-counter medicines.Innovative Medicines will run all the current Innovative Health businesses as well as the new Hospital Medicines business unit. Pfizer will also incorporate its biosimilar portfolio into its Oncology, and Inflammation and Immunology units.Established Medicines will hold the majority of Pfizer's off-patent drugs. This includes Lyrica, cholesterol drug Lipitor, high blood pressure drug Norvasc and erectile dysfunction drug Viagra. The business will run globally.The unit is meant to operate ""as a true stand-alone business within Pfizer,"" the company said in a news release. It will have its own manufacturing, marketing, regulatory and, with some exceptions, enabling functions.Consumer Healthcare, on the other hand, differs from Pfizer's two prescription medicine businesses, Pfizer said. The firm confirmed it's still mulling strategic alternatives for this unit. It expects to make a decision before the end of the year.""Trends in consumerism and an increased focus on staying healthy are causing consumers to seek easily accessible health and wellness solutions,"" the firm said. ""The company believes this business is well positioned to continue its growth.""Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:How Much Money Do You Need To Start Investing?How To Trade Stocks: Why Most Penny Stocks Fail To Make Investors RichNew Option Strategy Limits Risk Around Earnings

53,PFE,"Solid Biosciences (SLDB) plunged Wednesday on high volume after rival Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) reported strong data for its Duchenne muscular dystrophy treatment.On the stock market today, Solid Biosciences crashed 17.1% to close at 35.67. Sarepta, which unveiled strong results for its gene therapy in muscular dystrophy on Tuesday, saw its stock pop 6.8%, to 153.69. Biotech stocks collectively rose less than 1.5%.Both biotech companies are working on treatments for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a muscle-wasting disease with a genetic component. The condition is tied to mutations in the gene that makes dystrophin, a protein related to muscle fiber function.Despite Solid Biosciences' plummet Wednesday, analysts said the smaller biotech actually has the better Duchenne muscular dystrophy treatment.

Earlier in the week, the Food and Drug Administration lifted a clinical hold keeping the biotech company from enrolling patients in a study.It's likely that Solid Biosciences will report some data from the study earlier than guidance for the second half of 2019, Marai said. Solid Biosciences is competing against Sarepta and Dow Jones component Pfizer (PFE). But the market could support all three, he said.""We view the (Duchenne muscular dystrophy) market as being large enough to support multiple gene therapies and solutions,"" he said.Chardan analyst Gbola Amusa similarly sees Sarepta's report on Tuesday as having a positive impact on Solid Biosciences.

55,PFE,"When Kris Bakowski was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2002, the Georgia resident felt relieved to finally put a name to the fog that was slowly enveloping her brain, even if there was no viable Alzheimer's treatment.For months, she would forget her own phone number. She had trouble with colleagues' names. Mapping out her route home from work became a chore. One day she found herself alone at the mall without any recollection where she was or how she got there.Biopharma companies believe they might be able to help soon. Analysts say Biogen (BIIB) could be first to crack the code on a disease-modifying Alzheimer's treatment that slows the disease's progression. Indeed, Biogen and Tokyo-based Eisai announced late Thursday that Phase 2 tests on their Alzheimer's drug slowed progression of the disease after 18 months. The news sent Biogen stock soaring by more than 23% at one point Friday.Novartis (NVS), Roche (RHHBY), Amgen (AMGN) and others also are developing potential Alzheimer's drugs, along with a number of development-stage biotech companies.Victory is not certain, though. A number of Big Pharma companies, including Merck (MRK), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), have been down this road and abandoned planned Alzheimer's treatments. But at least one expert sees success in the next decade, which wouldn't come too soon for Bakowski and other Alzheimer's patients.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBakowski, now 62, has been blogging about her Alzheimer's experience for 15 years. In a blog post for the Alzheimer's Association, she describes the eight months of testing that led to her diagnosis and subsequent relief. She's hopeful for a cure in her son's lifetime, but her family isn't so optimistic.""My husband likened it to the Titanic — that the ship was sinking, and he and my son were going to survive and I wasn't,"" she wrote. ""My son reflected that it was like his mother was on death row, but innocent of the crime.""The potential Alzheimer's market is massive. An estimated 5.7 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's or other forms of dementia. Without a way to intervene, the Alzheimer's Association expects the cost of caring for people with these diseases to hit $1.1 trillion by 2050, in today's dollars. That would be up from an estimated $277 billion in 2018.But, like Bakowski, many experts are hopeful.Privately held Proclara Biosciences is among a cadre of biotech companies aiming to develop an Alzheimer's treatment. Chief Medical Officer David Michelson calls the field ""pretty vibrant.""Michelson, who has held positions at Merck and Lilly, says the steady drumbeat of ""bad news"" in Alzheimer's treatments reflects not so much a failure to affect their specific targets in the brain but issues such as side effects in specific tests. He recently spoke during a webinar hosted by Endpoints News.""There's a lot of really tremendous work that's ongoing and it's enabling new approaches that are becoming possible and generating promising new targets,"" he said. ""I am actually very hopeful and optimistic about what the next five to 10 years hold for research in Alzheimer's.""Several drugs have been approved in the U.S. to treat dementia of the Alzheimer's type, including Aricept from Eisai and Namenda from Allergan (AGN). Both treat the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Neither can cure the disease.Elliot Goldstein, chief executive of ProMIS Neurosciences, can count these types of treatment on one hand. None of them slow the progression of the disease, he told Investor's Business Daily. ProMIS is also working on an Alzheimer's treatment. It trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange for under 1 and doesn't have any sales or earnings yet. Goldstein previously worked at Novartis, which is also developing Alzheimer's drugs.Biogen's strongest hope is a drug now dubbed aducanumab. Goldstein predicts the drug will come to market in 2020.""Aducanumab has a high potential of approval because it has showed a small improvement on decline"" of patients into Alzheimer's symptoms, he said.Biogen did not respond to a request for comment for this article.Visit the IBD Stock Checkup to see how Biogen rates now on key fundamental and technical metrics.In total, Biogen has six potential Alzheimer's treatments in its pipeline. Aducanumab is farthest along, with a late-stage study likely to have data in 2019 or 2020, analysts say.Biogen and Eisai's Thursday announcement involved another drug known as BAN2401. Tests involved 856 patients diagnosed with early Alzheimer's. The companies said the drug, an antibody, achieved ""statistical significance on key predefined endpoints"" that evaluated effectiveness at 18 months. Biogen stock jumped 19.6% to close at 357.48 but had surged to an intraday high of 367.89 for a gain of 23.1% at one point.Still, it's a messy field. Biogen stock plunged 6.6% on Valentine's Day this year after it added 510 new patients to an ongoing study of aducanumab. That move caught investors off-guard. Also that week, Merck scrapped a late-stage Alzheimer's treatment study as the risks looked likely to outweigh benefits.""It can be a volatile area,"" Canaccord analyst Sumant Kulkarni told Investor's Business Daily. ""There have been very spectacular failures in the past. There's a component of the investor who thinks, 'What if the next one works?' That can help from a stock point of view.""Then again, he said, ""Nothing else has worked in the past.""The trouble in Alzheimer's treatment research is that scientists aren't exactly sure what causes the disease. One prevailing theory ties the disease to the buildup of toxic plaque in the brain. That happens when a protein called beta-amyloid structurally changes. Beta-amyloid is sticky and clumps together, becoming plaque.Pharmaceutical companies are looking at two approaches to beta-amyloid that essentially boil down to either removing it or preventing it. BACE inhibitors work to prevent the buildup, while monoclonal antibodies — like Biogen's aducanumab — aim to remove it.ProMIS' Goldstein notes adverse events also must be sidestepped. Some Alzheimer's treatments come with a side effect known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, or ARIA. This refers to swelling in the brain. Goldstein says ProMIS' Alzheimer's treatment, set to begin clinical studies in 2019, doesn't cause that.But Mizuho analyst Salim Syed says it's possible to help patients get past ARIA. A common idiom of the industry is, ""If you don't get ARIA, are you really treating the plaque?"" he told IBD.Then, there's the trouble of determining whether a study is designed well, Proclara's Michelson says. First, evidence must show the drug engaged the intended target, like beta-amyloid. Second, patients must be proven to actually have Alzheimer's. Third, the study must be big and of appropriate duration.""It turns out when you look back across history, there aren't that many studies and that many drugs that have been studied in a way that really fulfills all three of these elements,"" he said.He argues that only two studies have hit all three design goals. They are Merck's now-failed BACE inhibitor known as verubecestat and Biogen's aducanumab.In February, Merck scrapped a study of its Alzheimer's treatment in patients with prodromal, or very early-stage, Alzheimer's disease. A year earlier, it said the same drug had ""virtually no chance of finding a positive effect"" in patients with mild or moderate forms of the disease.Meanwhile, the field is thinning. J&J stopped a midstage test of a BACE inhibitor in a group of patients in May because of liver safety concerns. In January, Pfizer (PFE) stopped all research in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.Lilly's Alzheimer's treatment failure in late 2016 was acutely painful for the company. Its monoclonal antibody called solanezumab lost out in three late-stage studies. The last study was in patients with a mild form of Alzheimer's.ProMIS' Alzheimer's treatment binds to several toxic misfolded proteins causing Alzheimer's, Goldstein says. It functions on the theory that there are other targets in Alzheimer's disease outside of beta-amyloid. Some drugs are also testing the theory that tangles of a protein called tau could be the root cause.Privately held United Neurosciences hopes to come in with a vaccine for Alzheimer's. The goal is to use the drug as both a treatment for early Alzheimer's and as a preventive measure. Physicians must administer the drug before ""it's too late to rescue the brain,"" United Neurosciences Chief Medical Officer Ajay Verma told Investor's Business Daily.Verma's background is at Biogen, where he directed the development of drugs, including aducanumab. Before that, he was at Merck and Novartis.Verma expects aducanumab to get approval. Several sell-side analysts model around a 35% likelihood that aducanumab can appease the Food and Drug Administration.But Verma sees a possibility that aducanumab could be expensive, since it would be the first treatment to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease. ""I think the challenge is, will it be a solution or just for the rich?"" he said.Verma ultimately expects the solution to treating Alzheimer's disease to lie in combinations of drugs. That's been key in treating cancer, HIV, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease and high cholesterol, he says.Without intervention, the number of Alzheimer's patients will triple by 2050, James Hendrix said in Endpoints News' webinar. Hendrix is the director of global science initiatives for the Alzheimer's Association.""We need better therapies and we need them sooner rather than later,"" Hendrix said.But Alzheimer's treatment studies are tricky, United Neurosciences' Verma says. A barrier between the blood and the brain makes getting a drug to the brain difficult. Plus, animal models aren't particularly predictive, and studies must run for long periods of time.Further complicating matters, science isn't sure which stage is the best to treat.Those reasons are at the center of a 0.5% approval rate from the FDA for Alzheimer's treatments, according to a 2015 paper presented by Hendrix.

56,PFE,"Stock fought to a positive finish on Wednesday, as health care and construction stocks booked some of the day's widest losses, while video-game stocks notched a bevy of breakouts.X The Dow Jones industrial average led, ending up 0.3%, boosted by Boeing's (BA) monster 5% advance, on the heels of its glowing Q4 results. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1%, while the S&P 500 struggled to a fractional gain.Markets dropped sharply after the Fed's 2 p.m. ET announcement. The committee held its target interest rate unchanged, but offered a slightly more wary tone on inflation. The day's other economic news was positive, with early data from ADP showing January hiring slipped less than expected, while December pending home sales and a Chicago-region manufacturing for January gauge easily topped expectations.The Dow was held back some by medical components Merck (MRK), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Pfizer (PFE), which all dropped more than 2%. Drugmaker Eli Lilly (LLY) tumbled 5%, following a generally positive fourth-quarter report. But drug sector investors were apparently still reacting to Tuesday's news of an innovative health care partnership between Amazon.com (AMZN), Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) and JPMorgan (JPM).Amazon advanced 1.5%, putting it 20% past its 1213.10 buy point and in a profit-taking zone. The other three FANG stock tech leaders lost ground. Netflix (NFLX) fell furthest, down nearly 3%, but still extended after its early January breakout.Tesla (TSLA) rose 2.5% in average trade, for its third gain in four sessions. Shares are now up more than 20% from their November low and back above support at their 10- and 40-week moving averages, climbing the right side of a possible four-month base pattern.The video game trade was among the day's winners, with Ninetendo (NTDOY), Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) and Electronic Arts (EA) all clearing buy points or adding to entries. Ninetendo trimmed gains in afternoon trade, but remained just beyond buy range above a cup-base buy point at 54.06. Electronic Arts pared its advance and held in its buy range, after topping a 122.89 buy point, also from a cup base.Take-Two chalked up a 7% surge to end at the very top of a buy range above a 120.72 cup base buy point.Concrete and aggregates suppliers took the session's worst performance among industries, with U.S. Concrete (USCR) tumbling more than 6%, Eagle Materials (EXP) down 5% and Martin Marietta (MLM) and Vulcan Materials (VMC) falling 3% apiece. Eagle materials posted a mixed fourth quarter report before the open, but the reaction could also have been linked to public-private infrastructure cost-sharing questions raised in President Trump's State Of The Union address.Among IBD 50 names, telecom software developer Casa Systems (CASA) gained more than 6% in soft trade. The stock is attempting to start the right side of its first base, ending about 10% below its Jan. 16 high and 46% above its December IPO price.Argentina-based bank Grupo Servielle (SUPV), also an IBD 50 name, jumped almost 5% in nearly average trade. The move technically placed the stock in a buy range on a rebound from support at its 10-week moving average. But volume would need to kick in over the next day or so in order to confirm the buying opportunity.At the bottom of the IBD 50 list, MiMedx Group (MDXG) and Daqo New Energy (DQ) each shed about 5%.Other Important Market News For Wednesday:Bring Your Game As Apple, Amazon, Alphabet Report: Action PlanBiggest U.S. Homebuilder Hits Resistance, Despite 40% Earnings GainHow To Sell: Don't Freeze If Double-Digit Gain In A Stock Shrinks FastLooking For Breakout Stocks Like Nvidia?

57,PFE,"The major market averages carried more losses in early trade Tuesday as Amazon.com (AMZN) remained steady in the stock market today. All three major indexes — the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average declined over 1%.X Among the Dow Jones industrials, McDonald's (MCD) and Pfizer (PFE) both traded lower after reporting earnings early Tuesday. McDonald's topped Q4 earnings estimates amid strong same-stores sales growth, but shares fell 1.7% and remain above the 50-day line.Meanwhile, Pfizer dropped over 3% despite beating top- and bottom-line estimates. Shares are back in buy range from a 36.88 cup-with-handle buy point. Shares surged to multi-year highs Friday.Elsewhere in the Dow, Apple's (AAPL) recent free-fall continued Tuesday with another over-1% decline. Shares have fallen eight of the last 10 days after hitting a new high on Jan. 18. The stock is nearing the 7%-8% loss-cutting level from a 176.34 flat-base entry ahead of Thursday's earnings release.FANG stock Amazon.com announced a new partnership with Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) and JPMorgan (JPM) that centered around providing health care for their U.S. employees. Amazon fell 0.8% and remains well-extended from a 1,213.51 buy point.Among companies reporting earnings, Polaris Industries (PII) crumbled 11% to pierce its 50-day line in heavy volume. The stock had been battling to stay above a 134.77 flat-base entry since a Jan. 9 breakout, but had trouble clearing the resistance area.Meanwhile, homebuilder PulteGroup (PHM) barely beat the Street's Q4 earnings and sales targets, as the stock fell further under its 50-day line amid a 3% drop.Chip leaders Applied Materials (AMAT) and Nvidia (NVDA) fell about 3% each. Applied is searching for support at the 50-day line, as it etches a handle onto its cup formation. Graphics-chip maker Nvidia remains extended from a 218.77 cup-shaped base buy point.Chinese leaders were on the move lower after overnight weakness in the Shanghai Composite and the Hang Seng index. E-commerce giants Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD) fell nearly 3% apiece. Both were falling back into buy range from recent buy points.Alibaba was about 3% above a 191.85 cup-shaped base entry, while Leaderboard name JD was about 2% above a 47.50 cup-with-handle entry.Inside the IBD 50, only a handful of names were trading in positive territory amid the market's sell-off. Among the day's losers was Grubhub (GRUB). The food delivery service dropped 5% — just two days after breaking out above a 74.91 flat-base entry. Shares will look for support at their 50-day line.RELATED:What Apple's Stock Chart Is Telling Us Going Into Earnings, iPhone X GuidanceMcDonald's, EA To Report; More Medical Earnings: Investing Action PlanHow To Sell: Don't Freeze If Double-Digit Gain In A Stock Shrinks FastLooking For Breakout Stocks Like Nvidia?

58,PFE,"Despite the sell-off in health stocks Tuesday, a joint venture by Amazon.com (AMZN), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) to wring out cost savings from the health care system appears very unlikely to impact industry earnings over the next couple of years, according to analysts.X Figuring out how to rein in health costs without the participation of big health care players looks like a near-impossible task, Needham analyst Kevin Caliendo said. ""We note that the cost to implement systems, adjudicate patient data, and partner with hospitals, doctors, pharmacies on a national basis is onerous.""Caliendo adds that the scale of the big three new partners wouldn't be big enough to squeeze discounts out of providers by steering patients their way, compared to the purchasing power of UnitedHealth (UNH), CVS Health (CVS)-Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM). ""The new company will have to align itself with all these other providers in some way to provide the best care for its employees,"" Caliendo concludes.In fact, Caliendo gave CVS a big vote of confidence earlier Tuesday, saying its planned combination with Aetna positions it to create savings for the government and private employers. Needham raised its rating on CVS to strong buy with a 100 target.Caliendo does think that ""profits in the industry, especially at the underwriting level, are excessive,"" and there are improvements to the current care delivery model that can be made. He sees that as a prime reason behind the CVS-Aetna deal.CVS is looking to shift more health care services to the lowest-cost location: its in-store clinics. That's a different take on UnitedHealth's playbook of expanding into urgent care and other outpatient locales to drive savings for customers.But no such path forward was evident in the announcement from Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire. The plan to establish an independent company ""is in its early planning stages,"" according to a statement by the trio.""Our group does not come to this problem with answers,"" acknowledged Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett.""Success is going to require talented experts, a beginner's mind, and a long-term orientation,"" said Amazon's Jeff Bezos. Yet it's unclear at this point who any of those talented experts will be.As Wall Street weighed the long-term nature of the effort and the dearth of substantive details, the initial shock wave that rippled across Wall Street subsided. Shares of Dow Jones industrial average component UnitedHealth, the nation's largest insurer, sank 4.35% to 236.65 on the stock market today, after diving as much as 6.2% earlier. CVS Health, which is in the process of buying Aetna, pared losses to a 4.1% drop.Drug distributors Cardinal Health (CAH) and McKesson (MCK) were down 1.8% and 2.6%, respectively. Prescription benefit management firm Express Scripts (ESRX) sank 3.2%, but had tumbled 11.4% earlier. Both CVS and UnitedHealth also operate PBMs, which manage the prescription side of health insurance contracts.Pharmaceuticals and biotech stocks also lost ground, though the hit didn't look much worse than the broader market downdraft on Tuesday. Merck (MRK) shed 1.6%, Allergan (AGN) 1.6% and Gilead Sciences (GILD) 1.7% Pfizer (PFE) lost 3.1% despite topping earnings views and offering bullish guidance.IBD'S TAKE: UnitedHealth is ranked No. 2 by IBD in the Medical-Managed Care industry group based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance trends. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see the leaders in each category. Insurers have been solid performers, ranked No. 43 out of 197 groups. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks in leading groups that break above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.The knee-jerk reaction among investors is surely a reflection of the unsustainably high cost of health care in the U.S., and the fact that Amazon, which has been itching to disrupt the retail prescription business, is attached to the effort.Traditionally, the fear among health care investors has been that government — not the private sector — will impose cost controls to get a handle on runaway budget deficits, thinning out industry profits in the process. Medicare negotiating drug costs is one such fear, but industry experts say that the government is unlikely to produce much in the way of savings unless it is willing to deny patients access to certain drugs, which could create a political backlash.But Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire aren't the first big employers to join forces to attack health costs. Leerink analyst Ana Gupte noted on Tuesday that the Health Transformation Alliance, a group of 46 large self-insured employers that launched last year, also hopes to find savings and improve employee satisfaction, though it's working with CVS and UnitedHealth to achieve its aims. Initial reports indicated that alliance members expected to save a combined $600 million in prescription costs over three years.Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire say their initial focus will be on ""technology solutions that will provide U.S. employees and their families with simplified, high-quality and transparent healthcare at a reasonable cost."" The new corporate entity, they say, will be ""free from profit-making incentives and constraints.""Just what form those technology solutions would take is far from clear. Caliendo supposes that ""Berkshire might bring some underwriting skills (although they've never underwritten healthcare) and AMZN might make pharmacy and medical procurement contributions and provide IT expertise.""Leerkink's Gupte says she's unclear whether Amazon wading deeper into solving the health care mess will accelerate its move into the supply chain of the prescription industry.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Why Trump's State Of The Union Might Move Markets Up — Or DownStocks Fall As Market Shows 3 Signs It May Be Ready For A BreakGrubhub, Redhat Lead These Three IBD 50 Stocks In Buy RangeHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

A number of analysts raised their price targets on Intel following the results. Blue chip 3M is extending gains from a Jan. 12 breakout after the company beat profit estimates Thursday.Intel's rally caused a rebound in chip stocks, which were shelled Thursday on Texas Instruments' (TXN) latest results.Maxim Intergrated Products (MXIM), STMicroelectronics (STM) and Lam Research (LRCX) rose in unusually high volume.

""We do not expect this to impact our U.S. launch plan.""The duo isn't the first to get snagged in seeking U.S. approval for a Herceptin biosimilar. Mylan (MYL) and partner Biocon grabbed approval for theirs in December, but that followed a similar delay at the FDA.

A European Medicines Agency committee has recommended approving the Amgen/Allergan biosimilars and Pfizer's Herceptin biosimilars. Samsung/Biogen and Teva/Celltrion already have their copies on the market in Europe.Herceptin is a major cash cow for Roche. In 2017, it brought in $7.01 billion in sales, just behind fellow cancer drug Rituxan/MabThera, which generated $7.39 billion. Of Herceptin's sales, $2.1 billion stemmed from Europe.Roche is working feverishly to push back against competition for Herceptin.

Still, shares have largely traded below their 50-day moving average since early February. Other generic drug stocks rose a fraction.Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler kept her buy rating on Mylan stock, noting the topline missed expectations while the bottom line came out a penny ahead.

But European sales easily beat expectations and the rest of the world segment was in line.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFor the quarter, Mylan reported $2.68 billion in sales, down 1% vs. last year. The consensus had called for $2.73 billion, Mizuho's Koffler said. North America sales of $985.3 million lagged views for $1.1 billion. European sales grew 16% to $1.04 billion to top consensus for $967 million. Rest-of-the-world sales were in line, growing 8% to $626.7 million.The decline in North America was ""primarily due to the combined impact of the loss of exclusivity in olmesartan (blood pressure) products, lower sales of branded products, including the EpiPen Auto-Injector, the divestiture of certain contract manufacturing assets and the impact of the adoption of new accounting standards,"" Mylan said in a news release.Adjusted earnings of 96 cents per share climbed 3% year over year and beat consensus by a penny. That metric came in line with Mylan's own expectations.Despite the shortfall in the first quarter, Mylan reiterated its guidance for 2018 sales of $11.75 billion to $13.25 billion, beating consensus for $12.43 billion at the midpoint. Adjusted profit is expected to be $5.40-$5.60 a share, also topping analysts' views for $5.37 at the midpoint.Investors also are likely to look ahead to potential copycat versions of Amgen's (AMGN) bone marrow stimulant Neulasta and GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) asthma inhaler Advair.

66,PFE,"Amgen's (AMGN) future among biotech companies could be in trouble, an analyst said Tuesday.The No. 1 company in its sector trades at a premium to biotech companies Celgene (CELG) and Biogen (BIIB), but its pipeline contains fewer blockbuster opportunities. Meanwhile, generic and biosimilar competition is hacking away at a $15 billion chunk of its revenue, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said.Investors have been rewarding Amgen for its share repurchase programs and steady cash flows. But it lacks long-term stability. Generally, investors look for biotech companies with unpriced optionality in their pipelines. Amgen doesn't have that.""In Amgen's case, the inability to identify which programs might offer that upside, particularly for a company of this size, reinforces our belief that Amgen must commit to significant business development activity to expand its portfolio or its pipeline,"" Porges said in a report to clients.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UsePorges estimates 65% of Amgen's portfolio is likely to steadily decline. Some of its biggest moneymakers — Epogen, Aranesp, Neupogen, Neulasta and Enbrel — are facing rivalries. The growth potential of new and acquired products isn't enough to offset declines in these franchises.Epogen and Aranesp treat anemia. Dow Jones component Pfizer (PFE) just gained approval to make a copy of Epogen/Procrit. Novartis (NVS) also has a copycat of Neupogen, a bone marrow stimulant.Blockbusters Neulasta and Enbrel are also at risk. Neulasta also stimulates bone marrow. Enbrel treats some chronic diseases, including forms of arthritis and psoriasis. Novartis already has a copycat of Enbrel. Novartis, Mylan (MYL) and Coherus Biosciences (CHRS) are working to copy Neulasta.In response, Amgen has restructured its expense base, initiated a dividend and levered up the company's balance sheet, Porges said.But, ""compared to peers, we regard Amgen as a more defensive stock, but also one lacking the explosive upside potentially typically associated with breakthrough or rapidly growing bio-therapeutic stocks,"" he said.Porges sees Amgen as worth about $130 billion or 194 per share, which is about 10% above the most recent closing price. He has a market perform rating and 210 price target on Amgen stock. On the stock market today, shares rose 1.1% to close at 178.36. Shares of biotech companies lifted a fraction.""The most concerning conclusion of this analysis is the lack of opportunity in Amgen's pipeline outside the elements in our (sum-of-the-parts),"" he said. Celgene and Biogen, on the other hand, have ""greater pipeline optionality and growth prospects.""Eventually, the firm will have to engage in smart mergers and acquisitions, Porges said. The best mergers and acquisitions will pivot away from Amgen's challenged legacy products to mid- to late-stage pipeline opportunities to build on its revenue projections for 2020-30.It's possible the biotech could be interested in a ""merger of equals.""As it stands, ""the company's current pipeline is either very early or has shared economics, and thus is unlikely to meaningfully alter the outlook for an about $120 billion company with current revenue of $23 billion per year,"" he said.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Trade Stocks: Why Most Penny Stocks Fail To Make Investors RichNew Option Strategy Limits Risk Around Earnings

67,PFE,"BioMarin Pharmaceuticals (BMRN), Spark Therapeutics (ONCE) and UniQure (QURE) are racing to be the first to market with a gene therapy that treats hemophilia — a prospect that could offer revenue north of $1.5 million per patient, an analyst said Monday.Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz boosted his projections for hemophilia gene therapies to $1.5 million from earlier assumptions for $350,000-$500,000 per patient. Some treatments could go as high as $2 million per patient on a gross basis, he said.Schwartz's analysis is based on pricing for Luxturna, a gene therapy from Spark that treats an ultrarare blindness disorder. Luxturna goes for $425,000 per eye. This ""sets a useful precedent"" for pricing other gene-based treatments, such as hemophilia gene therapies, he says.""We believe the manufacturers are testing the waters currently as they embark on Phase 3 trials in order to determine where payers push back significantly,"" he said in a note to clients. ""Based on our checks, a price somewhere in the range of $1 million to $2 million per patient seems most likely.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe challenge with pricing gene therapies is that these treatments are being billed as one-time cures, which could warrant a higher price. But most analysts doubt that will actually be the case. Further, they expect payers to push back on high prices without data to back up the therapies' durability.An agreement with Harvard Pilgrim Health Care to cover Luxturna is based on 30 months of durability data. That sets an important precedent, Schwartz said. By the time they come to market, the slew of hemophilia gene therapies currently under investigation will have 30-50 months of durability data.Schwartz expects BioMarin to lead Spark in treating hemophilia A. Hemophilia A is a genetic deficiency in a key blood-clotting protein known as Factor VIII. BioMarin is in Phase 3 testing of a gene therapy called valoctocogene roxaparvovec, or Valrox. Spark's therapy, SPK-8011, is in Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies.""We believe an effective gene therapy for hemophilia could garner at least 2.5 times the annual cost of Factor (VIII) replacement therapy based on durable (effectiveness) data,"" Schwartz said.BioMarin could enter the hemophilia A market in 2022 and hit peak sales of $4.5 billion in 2030, he said. Spark will likely enter the market a year later with SPK-8011. Schwartz calls for SPK-8011 to garner $4 billion in peak sales in 2030.Spark also is working on a hemophilia B gene therapy called SPK-9001, under a partnership with Dow Jones stock Pfizer (PFE). There, it trails UniQure's therapy called AMT-061. AMT-061 is expected to begin Phase 3 studies in the third quarter. SPK-9001 is in Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies.Schwartz models peak sales of SPK-9001 at $1 billion in 2027 with Spark receiving $134 million in peak royalties. He boosted his price target on Spark to 74 from 55, and kept his market perform rating. He also raised his price target on BioMarin to 145 from 132, and reiterated his outperform rating.On the stock market today, UniQure popped 4.9% to close at 30.39. Spark advanced 3.6% to finish at 73.21. BioMarin gained 1.9% to close at 86.97.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Build Long-Term Profits In Stocks?

75,PFE,"Faced with a choice between temporary tax cuts and permanent tax reform, Republicans appear to be heading down the oxymoronic path known as temporary tax reform.Despite House Speaker Paul Ryan's insistence that business tax cuts need to be permanent — ""Businesses aren't doing multibillion-dollar, multiyear capital decisions if they see a tax code that's unpredictable"" — the GOP has already taken one big step in the opposite direction with their plan to phase out a provision allowing for the immediate write-off of equipment spending after five years.Before long, Republicans are bound to face the reality that a permanent 20% corporate tax rate, or anything close, can't be attained after they ditched Ryan's trillion-dollar border-adjustment tax in the face of opposition from Wal-Mart (WMT) and other major retailers. Cutting the corporate rate to 20% would alone cost $3 trillion in the second decade, yet the GOP has only spelled out about $400 billion in savings from repealing business tax breaks, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis.While the GOP will surely insist that the tax cuts will eventually be made permanent, making corporate tax cuts temporary — even if only on paper to meet Senate budget reconciliation rules — would have two big negative consequences that will imperil tax legislation:That combination (smaller offsets for corporate tax hikes and tax cuts that pay for virtually none of themselves) will make it all the more difficult to come up with a politically tenable way to shrink $5.8 trillion in proposed business and individual income tax cuts to fit the $1.5 trillion hole allowed for under the Senate budget resolution, equal to a modest 0.6% of GDP.On the business side, the GOP has proposed $2.9 trillion in business tax cuts over the first decade and only about $300 billion in savings. Eliminating the one sizable deduction still on the table, the deduction for interest paid on business borrowing, could raise as much as $1.2 trillion and get Republicans much closer to their goal. Yet the tax framework makes it clear that the GOP is wary of taking on this valuable tax benefit, saying that the deduction will be only ""partially limited"" for corporations, with more favorable treatment implied for noncorporate borrowers. The interest deduction is an especially big one for utilities and telecommunications firms like Verizon (VZ), which has $100 billion in debt.Tax reformers generally have discussed ending interest deductibility in conjunction with allowing companies to immediately write off capital expenditures. Yet the GOP plan only would allow immediate expensing for equipment, not structures, and would phase out that benefit after five years.Even if full expensing of capital investment were made permanent, Goldman Sachs economists have noted that the long-run effect of tax reform that eliminates interest deductibility could be neutral or negative on investment if the corporate tax rate ends up much above 20%. Phasing out immediate expensing, therefore, raises doubt about the economic impact of tax reform and will encourage companies already girding for a fight to preserve interest deductibility to further dig in.Goldman Sachs has predicted ""no substantial changes"" to the interest deduction. Meanwhile, with few offsets to cover the cost, Goldman envisions the proposed corporate tax rate rising from 20% to 25%, as the targeted tax rate for small-business and partnership income rises from 25% to 30%.Yet even assuming that tax cuts are smaller and phased in gradually, it's hard to see how the GOP shrinks the net 10-year cost of business tax cuts to less than $1 trillion, leaving modest room to cut taxes for the middle class. Further, the second-decade cost of even a 25% corporate tax rate would approach $2 trillion. Unless the GOP changes its tune and aggressively targets the interest deduction, or individual tax hikes cover the cost of a lower corporate rate, a 25% rate would have to be made temporary to avoid a Democratic filibuster.IBD'S TAKE: The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 23,400 on Tuesday, up more than 1,500 points since IBD changed its market trend indicator to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a yellow light turning green. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. Having to resort to a 25% corporate tax rate also creates another major political headache: what to do about international tax shelters. Republicans plan a modest tax on tech companies like Alphabet (GOOGL) and Apple (AAPL) and drugmakers like Pfizer (PFE) that have amassed piles of cash to avoid paying high domestic tax rates on profits earned overseas. Yet the GOP is also weighing a minimum tax on future profits earned overseas that would apply if companies generate much of their overseas income in tax havens. While multinationals already are signaling strong opposition to the idea, expect the opposition to intensify if Republicans try to attach a minimum global tax to a temporary corporate tax cut. Those concerns will multiply under a 25% U.S. rate, since the incentive for businesses to avoid U.S. taxes would be much higher.One thing seems clear: As the GOP tax-reform push proceeds, we're in for a cycle of deflating hopes for tax relief and a lasting economic boost, and inflating projections of deficits and debt. If the best that the GOP can do is to offer temporary corporate tax cuts that leave a legacy of more debt and little else, it's not hard to imagine Sens. Bob Corker and John McCain, among the rare lawmakers who might pass as deficit hawks, pulling their support. Both have no loyalty to Trump. Neither have to worry about reelection. Corker has already signaled concern that Congress won't have the ""intestinal fortitude"" to stand up to special interests and do tax reform in the right way, while McCain voted against President George W. Bush's temporary tax packages in 2001 and 2003.Is there a third senator who might break with his or her party? The fate of tax cuts may come down to Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, who announced his retirement on Tuesday in a blistering speech, and Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who hails from a state that voted for Hillary Clinton and whose stand against TrumpCare showed she's more than willing to defy her party.RELATED:House Continues To Toy With 401(k) Contribution Cap$100 Billion Question: Will Trump Let Alphabet, Pfizer Keep Tax Havens?These Are The Biggest Losers From Trump's Tax ReformStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

76,PFE,"The GOP-led Senate late Thursday approved a budget resolution that sets aside room for a net $1.5 trillion tax cut over the coming decade.The 51-49 vote is important because it will allow the GOP to pass tax cuts with just 50 votes, plus Vice President Pence. With the exception of Kentucy Sen. Rand Paul, the Republican holdouts who derailed ObamaCare repeal were on board.Yet, even assuming that the House will agree to the Senate's deficit-hiking budget, all of the hard work remains because Republicans are starting with unrealistic expectations for what President Trump is still calling ""the largest tax cuts in U.S. history.""Wall Street expects that Trump will sign tax cuts into law in the first half of 2018, but that the package will be a whole lot smaller by then. Analysts at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have indicated that they see a 25% corporate tax rate as much more likely than the 20% that the White House says is nonnegotiable.Even a 25% corporate rate would be good news for the stock market, raising S&P 500 earnings by 8% and potentially pushing the S&P 500 index to 2650 by year end, says Goldman chief equity strategist David Kostin.The big challenge will be to squeeze individual tax cuts and corporate tax cuts through a $1.5 trillion hole.While Republicans are counting on dynamic scoring to show that the tax legislation will pay for itself to a significant extent, they are likely to be sorely disappointed by official scores from the Joint Committee on Taxation for two key reasons.The first problem is that there appears to be very little chance Republicans will find the budget offsets to make corporate tax cuts permanent. Yet even the conservative Tax Foundation has said that temporary corporate tax cuts would initially boost growth, but then the effects of a corporate tax cut would substantially reverse.The second problem is that the official budget scorekeepers use dynamic scoring models that will penalize the GOP for adding more than $1 trillion in debt over the first decade, because the extra debt is seen as likely to push up interest rates and raise the cost of capital.To utilize the Senate's filibuster-proof reconciliation process, the GOP plan can't add to deficits beyond the first decade, yet cutting the corporate rate to 20% will alone cost $3 trillion in the second decade, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center. As of now, the GOP has only spelled out about $300 billion in savings from repealing business tax breaks.The tax framework jointly released by the White House and GOP leaders in the House and Senate last month included $2.6 trillion in net business tax cuts in the first decade, the Tax Policy Center said. While the cost could be lowered by phasing in the tax cuts, that won't be nearly sufficient to shrink the cost enough to make room for deficit-increasing individual tax cuts.The effort to find offsetting savings to pay for business tax cuts is off to a rough start. The GOP dropped House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan to impose a border-adjustment tax after a fierce lobbying campaign from retailers like Wal-Mart (WMT). The border adjustment tax would have raised an additional $1.1 trillion by applying a 20% tax on imports.IBD'S TAKE: The Dow Jones industrial average ended above 23,000 for the first time on Wednesday, up nearly 1,250 points since IBD changed its market trend indicator on Aug. 22 to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a yellow light turning green.

That interest deduction is an especially big one for utilities and telecommunications firms like Verizon (VZ), which has more than $100 billion in debt.While the unified framework put together by the Trump administration and GOP leaders in Congress does state that the deduction will be ""partially limited"" for corporate borrowers, Goldman Sachs is skeptical, predicting ""no substantial changes"" to the deduction.Republicans plan a modest tax on tech companies like Alphabet (GOOGL) and Apple (AAPL) and drugmakers like Pfizer (PFE) that have amassed piles of cash to avoid paying high domestic tax rates on profits earned overseas. Yet the GOP is also weighing a minimum tax on future profits earned overseas that would apply if companies generate much of their overseas income in tax havens. While multinationals already are signaling strong opposition to the idea, expect the opposition to intensify if Republicans try to attach a minimum global tax to a temporary corporate tax cut.Congress also is struggling to find ways to offset the cost of individual tax cuts, as some leading Republicans in Congress have wavered about eliminating the deduction for state and local income taxes, which would raise $1.3 trillion over the first decade. There's been talk of preserving the deduction for households making under $400,000, which would only save about one-third as much. Meanwhile, charities and real estate companies are gearing up to fight the GOP plan to double the standard deduction because it threatens to erode the value of deductions for home mortgages and charitable contributions.RELATED:S&P 500 Futures Jump after Senate OKs Budget Resolution Paving Way For Tax CutsThis Is Why Trump's 20% Corporate Tax Rate Isn't Going To Happen $100 Billion Question: Will Trump Let Alphabet, Pfizer Keep Tax Havens?

80,PFE,"Tech companies like Alphabet (GOOGL) and Apple (AAPL) and drugmakers like Pfizer (PFE) that have amassed piles of cash to avoid paying high domestic tax rates on profits earned overseas have been singled out as big potential winners under Trump's tax reform, but don't count on it. When push comes to shove in getting the U.S. corporate rate down to 20%, or close to it, to ""make America great again,"" the revenue lost to international tax havens may be needed to make the numbers work.The GOP tax framework released late last month reiterates President Trump's long-held goal to ""bring back trillions of dollars that are currently kept offshore to reinvest in the American economy."" To that end, the plan would require that accumulated profits held offshore be repatriated, but at a much lower tax rate than they would have faced under existing law if they voluntarily brought the cash back home.The idea excites investors, who anticipate that the freed-up cash will translate into bigger stock buybacks, dividends and cash-funded acquisitions. Meanwhile, U.S. multinationals are so far on board with what would essentially be a retroactive tax hike because the GOP plan also would give them permanent relief on profits earned both at home and abroad.Apple could hit a $1 trillion market cap under tax reform, RBC Capital Markets speculated Tuesday.But there are some pretty big risks to this story. The first potential trouble spot arises straight from the tax reform framework.The GOP has long wanted to shift the U.S. to a territorial tax system that taxes corporate profits in the country where they are earned, as most other nations do, instead of taxing international profits only when (and if) they are repatriated, with a credit for foreign taxes paid. But the new Republican tax plan doesn't quite go that far. Instead, it endorses a minimum tax on international profits, though at a ""reduced rate"" relative to the proposed 20% rate paid on corporate income earned in the U.S. The first risk is that this unspecified reduced tax rate could end up being higher than some companies now pay on overseas earnings.Take Pfizer, which had an international tax rate of 9% in 2016 ($1.5 billion in current taxes on $16.9 billion in profits), even before deferred income-tax credits that further shrunk the bill. Alphabet had an even lower current international tax rate of 7.9% ($966 million on profit of $12.1 billion). Apple's international tax rate in fiscal 2016 was just 5.1% ($2.1 billion in current taxes on $41.1 billion in income).Now suppose that the minimum tax rate on foreign profits is set as high as 15%, or three-fourths of the proposed 20% U.S. corporate tax rate. Under such circumstances, the rewards of tax reform might look a whole lot leaner for Google's parent and turn into a downer for the maker of Viagra.While there's no indication that the international minimum tax rate will get as high as 15%, political aesthetics and budgetary math both raise the risk that some companies could face significantly higher international tax rates than they do now. Alphabet, which owed $3.5 billion in current federal taxes on U.S. revenue of $12 billion, would still see a lower overall tax bill if the U.S. rate gets knocked down close to 20%. But a high minimum rate would surely lower the appeal of tax reform to a company like Pfizer, which has regularly reported losses from U.S. operations and doesn't stand to gain much from a lower U.S. corporate rate. Although Pfizer got almost exactly half its $52.8 billion in revenue from the U.S., it pays relatively little federal tax ($342 million in 2016, before deferred tax credits worth $419 million).IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Alphabet are closing in on a 1006.29 buy point, the point at which investors have the best opportunity for near-term gains. Here's a good place to start to quickly find the best stocks to buy right now.Testifying at a Senate Finance Committee hearing on international taxation last week, Reed College economist Kimberly Clausing estimated that ""profit shifting to tax havens now costs the U.S.
"
81,PFE,"government more than $100 billion each year.""At the hearing, both Clausing and Stephen Shay, who served in the Treasury Department under Presidents Obama and Reagan, noted problems with the Republican idea for a minimum tax that is applied to foreign earnings on a cumulative basis, rather than on a country-by-country basis. Clausing estimates that 98% of profit shifting relates to countries with a sub-15% tax rate. Under one global minimum rate, Shay said that companies could seek to preserve their tax savings from shifting income to low-rate countries by increasing investment in higher-rate countries.It's worth noting that one of the ""international"" tax havens popular among pharmaceutical and biotech firms is Puerto Rico, which is a U.S. territory but is categorized as international in corporate filings. Puerto Rico's mounting troubles make it unlikely that tax policy will penalize companies with manufacturing facilities there.The biggest hurdle to cutting the U.S. corporate tax rate is the budgetary math. Republicans are trying to squeeze about $2.6 trillion in business tax cuts into a $1.5 trillion hole, leaving little room for individual rate cuts. Beyond 10 years, the math gets a lot worse, casting doubt on whether permanent tax changes are doable.To utilize the Senate's filibuster-proof reconciliation process, the GOP plan can't add to deficits beyond the first decade, yet cutting the corporate rate to 20% will alone cost $3 trillion in the second decade, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center. As of now, the GOP has only spelled out about $300 billion in savings from repealing business tax breaks.If the 20% corporate rate starts moving higher, the risk is that the international minimum rate will move along with it.RELATED:This Could Push Apple To $1 Trillion Market Cap, Analyst SaysThis Is Why Trump's 20% Corporate Tax Rate Isn't Going To Happen  McCain Killed ObamaCare Repeal, Wounded Tax Reform In One BlowThese Are The Biggest Losers From Trump's Tax ReformStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAccording to Baum, Pfizer sees the return on risk as much higher in the immuno-oncology space. Bristol, though, has doubled down in recent history on immuno-oncology matchups, particularly between its drugs Opdivo and Yervoy.Bristol is pairing Opdivo and Yervoy as a first treatment for advanced lung cancer. Earlier this year, that regimen outperformed chemotherapy by improving progression-free survival in some patients. Next up, the firm will unveil overall survival data for the combo.Dow Jones component Merck (MRK) already has an immuno-oncology regimen approved as a first treatment in advanced lung cancer. Its drug Keytruda grabbed accelerated approval in 2017 as a combination with chemotherapy for this use.The data could be transformational — or cause Bristol's stock to dive — making it an easier target for a takeover. Pfizer, though, does have its own immuno-oncology program. As of last April, the firm had 11 compounds in immuno-oncology studies.Citigroup's Baum has a sell rating on Pfizer. He cut his price target on Bristol to 70 from 78, but kept his buy rating on the stock.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityLong-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFsShould You Buy A Stock Ahead Of Its Earnings Report?

Celgene already owned 9.7% of Juno from a 2015 deal to collaborate on cancer and autoimmune drugs. The merger is expected to close this quarter.Juno is among those working on CAR-T therapies, which engineer a patient's own immune cells to identify and fight cancer cells. Celgene pegs its lead drug, known as JCAR017, as getting approval in the U.S. in 2019 and bringing in a potential peak of $3 billion in sales beyond 2020.IBD'S TAKE: Celgene was particularly hurt in the third quarter when its bigger drugs Revlimid and Otezla missed expectations. And it's not the only one facing a patent cliff in the mid-2020s. See who else is at risk by visiting the Industry Snapshot.Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond suggested that guidance could be overly bullish.Celgene is ""setting a relatively high bar for an asset that likely won't be alone in its class,"" he said in a note. ""However, if this guidance is achievable, this could be an important source of revenue in the mid- to long-term as Celgene looks to plug a Revlimid hole once its goes generic starting in 2022.""But competition is looking stiff. Gilead Sciences (GILD) spent nearly $12 billion to acquire Kite Pharma last year. About that time, Gilead-Kite gained approval for a CAR-T therapy, following Novartis (NVS), which was first out of the gate with an approval in August.Celgene expects JCAR017 to get approval to treat diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Gilead's drug, Yescarta, is approved to treat that population and Novartis is looking to get its drug, Kymriah, approved for that use as well.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges views the deal positively as it ""consolidates and streamlines"" Celgene's efforts in CAR-T. Celgene also partners with Bluebird Bio (BLUE), working on a multiple myeloma drug known as bb2121, which targets an antigen known as BCMA.""Owning Juno allows Celgene to focus its BCMA efforts initially on Bluebird's bb2121 and to make Juno the vehicle for all development of (drugs that target the CD19 protein), and for the exploration of other targets as opportunities,"" he said in a note to clients.Mizuho analyst Salim Syed noted there can be no cross-pollination in the manufacturing of Juno and Bluebird drugs, but there will be knowledge-based synergies. It's unsure whether Celgene could even look to acquire Bluebird without triggering antitrust concerns, he said.Early Monday, Sanofi said it would buy hemophilia player Bioverativ for $105 per share. The deal is a 64% premium to Bioverativ's closing price Friday, Piper Jaffray's Raymond wrote in another note.""We're not shocked one bit,"" he said. ""With a $1 billion topline and revenue growth of more than 31% last year, yet trading at just five times fiscal year 2018 revenue estimates, we have long viewed Bioverativ as a potential takeout target.""The deal comes after Sanofi twice failed in 2016 and 2017 to make big acquisitions. In 2016, Dow's Pfizer (PFE) beat out Sanofi in a battle for cancer player Medivation. Last year, Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) acquired rare disease biotech Actelion Pharma out from under Sanofi.Sanofi is facing mounting competition for its diabetes drugs. But the trick will be convincing investors that the hemophilia market won't be disrupted by gene therapy and product launches like Roche's (RHHBY) drug Hemlibra, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a note.""At a minimum, after a number of speculated successful bids, including Medivation and Actelion, Sanofi investors now have a deal to digest that is immediately accretive to 2018 earnings and estimated to be 'up to 5% accretive in 2019,' "" he said.RBC analyst Kennen MacKay called the bid strong given upcoming competition from Roche, but noted it's likely Sanofi is building on ""lessons learned in the Medivation and Actelion processes where Sanofi led with low offers and was later bested by competitive bidders.""But investors weren't as sure of the merger. Biogen spun out its hemophilia business into Bioverativ a year ago.Bioverativ has two approved drugs, Eloctate in hemophilia A and Alprolix in hemophilia B. Last year, Bioverativ acquired True North Therapeutics.Credit Suisse's Martin called True North ""one of the stronger acquisitions of 2017."" Under it, Bioverativ gained access to a drug now known as BIVV009 to treat a rare autoimmune disease. He models $19 per share for that drug alone.RELATED:Which Biotechs Could Surprise To The Upside On Earnings?This Biotech Stock Rocketed 15% On Rumors Biogen Could Buy ItHow Hospitals Plan To Put Pressure On Generic-Drug Makers

87,PFE,"Cellectis (CLLS) popped early Wednesday after it and Dow's Pfizer (PFE) presented strong data for the first in-human trials of a cancer therapy at the American Society of Hematology conference.X By the closing bell on the stock market today, Cellectis had leapt 11.6% to finish at 26.80, after earlier rising as much as 18.5%, near a five-week high. Pfizer advanced 0.2%, near 36.64.The Phase 1 studies tested a drug known as UCART19 in adult and pediatric patients with a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia that either relapsed or didn't respond to other methods of treatment.Collectively, patients achieved an 83% remission rate across both populations. Five out of seven adult patients achieved remission with no evidence of disease in the blood cells or bone marrow at day 28 after treatment with UCART19, Cellectis said in a news release.Only one case of graft-vs.-host disease occurred and there were no instances of severe neurotoxicity. One patient developed severe cytokine release syndrome, characterized by flu-like symptoms, and died. This was previously reported, Instinet analyst Christoper Marai said in a report to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Earlier in the week, several biotechs popped following presentations at the American Society of Hematology. Follow their news by visiting IBD Industry Themes.In the pediatric trial, all five children achieved minimal residual disease, enabling them to proceed to a stem cell transplant. There was only one case of graft-vs.-host disease and none of neurotoxicity. Cytokine release syndrome cases were mild and manageable.Marai views Cellectis' UCART platform to be ""more fundamentally transformative to the cellular therapy space"" than a new target for traditional CAR-T therapies. CAR-T therapy teaches a patient's immune system to fight cancer using specific targets in the body.Cellectis describes its UCART platform as a ""frozen, off-the-shelf T-cell-based medicinal product."" It is allogeneic rather than autologous, meaning the cells used are from a donor and produced for a wide population rather than directly from the patient.""Fundamentally, the data presented established viability and success of allogeneic CAR-T, through a path to re-dosing and validation across multiple targets (which was previously thought to be impossible),"" Marai said.He reiterated his buy rating and 43 price target on Cellectis.RELATED:Why This Biotech Stock Is Defying A Hematology-Related PitfallWhy Gilead Could Have 'Greatest' Ever In HIV Drug LaunchesAmazon Reportedly In Talks With Mylan, Novartis About Pharma Entry

88,PFE,"Futures for the S&P 500 index were little changed late Wednesday. The major averages edged lower during the regular session. Diamondback Energy (FANG) cleared a buy point in double-normal volume. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) has pulled back since edging past an entry in so-so trade. Fellow Dow industrial components Microsoft (MSFT), Walt Disney (DIS) and Pfizer (PFE) have retreated back into their bases after getting an inflated boostX Volume is sometimes overlooked by investors. But it's a key indicator of institutional support. It's good to see volume rising at least 40%-50% above normal on a breakout. Low-volume breakouts can succeed, but the odds are much lower.S&P 500 and Dow futures rose slightly vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.1%.Diamondback Energy rose 4.9% to 117.24 in Wednesday's stock market trading, blasting above a 115.03 flat-base buy point. Volume was 110% above the 50-day moving average, and really picked up in the afternoon.There's no guarantee that Diamondback's move will succeed. Several recent Diamondback breakouts failed or went nowhere. But the strong volume is positive. And there are reasons to be encouraged beyond the price-and-volume action.The shale operator has five straight quarters of strong earnings growth. Analysts predict a 56% EPS gain in the current quarter. Crude futures at two-year highs also bodes well going forward.Oil and gas groups dominated IBD's top-performing industries on Wednesday, with mining and steel also faring well. Shale and other energy plays dominated the S&P 500's biggest winners.Several energy stocks are closing in on buy points. That includes fellow shale plays Concho Resources (CXO) and EOG Resources (EOG), as well as oil majors such as Chevron (CVX), ConocoPhillips (COP), BP (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA).Diamondback was added to IBD's Leaderboard on Wednesday.Apple rose 1.4% to 176.34 on Monday, just nudging past a 176.24 base-on-base entry. But volume was just 8% above normal. A Nomura downgrade pushed the iPhone maker below its entry on Tuesday, with Apple nudging down 0.1% on Wednesday to 174.35.If Apple retakes that 176.34 entry in bullish trade, the chart would look a lot more inviting.Microsoft, Pfizer and Disney are exceptions that prove the rule on volume's importance. They all moved into buy range on Friday in powerful volume. But last Friday was a triple-witching expiration day, pushing up market volume sharply. On those days, gains in heavy volume aren't necessarily a sign of conviction buys by mutual funds and other big institutions.The three Dow components certainly haven't followed through this week.Microsoft has retreated 1.5% to 85.52, back below the 86.30 flat-base entry. Disney lost 1.9% on Wednesday to 109.69, dropping under its 110.93 buy point in a somewhat messy double-bottom base. There were some indications that, after a strong opening weekend, ""The Last Jedi"" ticket sales sagged on Monday and Tuesday.Pfizer has skidded 2% this week to 36.46, undercutting its 36.88 entry.RELATED:The Big Picture: Will 2018 Be A Repeat Of This Year's Bull Run?Apple Just Hit A Buy Point, Joining These 3 Dow StocksEnergy Stocks And Industry NewsHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

89,PFE,"Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) continued its two-day upswing Friday after announcing the launch of a generic version of a drug from Gilead Sciences (GILD), a day after the drugmaker unveiled a massive cost-cutting plan.X In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Teva lifted 6.2%, near 18.40. Earlier, the stock popped as much as 8.1%. Shares closed up 10.2% on Thursday, the day Teva said it would cut $3 billion by the end of 2019 to deal with its debt.Gilead's drug, Viread, is approved to treat HIV and hepatitis B in some patients. Teva is launching a generic version of Viread 300-milligram tablets in the U.S. in the hopes of taking a chunk of the $762 million in annual U.S. sales Viread garnered as of October.There are an estimated 1.1 million and 850,000 people living in the U.S. with HIV and chronic hepatitis B, respectively, who could benefit from Viread, Teva said in a news release. The launch adds to Teva's generic portfolio of nearly 600 medications.On Monday, Teva also announced its launch of a generic version of Viagra, which is branded by Dow stock Pfizer (PFE). As of August, the erectile dysfunction drug had annual sales of $1.4 billion in the U.S., Teva said in a news release.Goldman Sachs analyst Jami Rubin praised Teva for its plans to cut $3 billion in costs over the next two years. The cuts will come in the form of layoffs, closing manufacturing facilities and suspending its dividends on ordinary shares.IBD'S TAKE: Teva has an IBD Composite Rating of 14 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it underperforms the lion's share of stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But other generic drug stocks have stronger ratings like Ani Pharmaceuticals, which comes in at 97. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at other strong players in the generic-drug landscape.Rubin had initially expected Teva to announce a plan to cut $1 billion to $2 billion in costs by 2020. She expects New Chief Executive Kare Schultz to deliver on his promises based on a background at Lundbeck where he ""repeatedly understated and overdelivered.""""We acknowledge there is investor skepticism around the health of the base business, but note this is the first time in a while where we have seen a concrete strategy towards de-levering the company, which is a top priority,"" she said in a note to clients.The conference call on Thursday suggests a weaker base for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, but this will be more than offset by cost contribution, Rubin said.As part of the restructuring, Teva is combining its generics and specialty units, and will focus its efforts in the U.S., Europe and emerging markets. Rubin sees drugs in migraines and involuntary movements tied to Huntington's disease as leading Teva's specialty unit.Rubin acknowledges this could create additional downside risk to Teva's top line, but sees the exit from unprofitable businesses as a potential mark for the bottoming of U.S. generic pricing.""We are not calling the bottom yet, however, but will closely monitor the rate and magnitude of rationalization efforts as important sign posts,"" she said.She boosted her price target on Teva to 20 from 15 and upgraded the stock to a buy rating from neutral.RELATED:Teva Pharma Announces Layoffs, Suspends Dividends To Tackle DebtWhy Amgen Could Have An Edge Over These Rivals In Preventing MigrainesTeva's Restructuring Plan: Another Case Of Been Here, Done That?

Volume was more than double average, which is impressive on the surface. But triple-witching expirations inflated trading activity, making it unclear if big institutions were loading up on shares.

One contract gives the holder the right to buy, but not the obligation, to buy 100 shares of Alibaba at 182.50 for a cost of $510, excluding commission.Keep in mind that when taking the premium paid into account, Alibaba would have to rally north of 187 for the trade to start making money.

The Nasdaq composite was down slightly.Institutions were selling GE shares hard. The stock's volume finished at 95.8 million shares, 64% heavier than usual. The megacap firm's average daily turnover over the past 50 sessions is 58.2 million shares.GE slid nearly 13% in monster weekly volume last week.The Dow Jones industrial average is a price-weighted index of 30 names, and the keepers of the average replace lagging companies with higher-priced better performers. Recent new entrants include not just Apple but also Goldman Sachs (GS) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH). All three trade at more than 100 a share.Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Pfizer (PFE) have the next-lowest share prices within the Dow 30, trading near 34 and 35.08, respectively.Cisco, a giant in computer networking and internet-based telecom gear, is challenging institutional buying support near a 34.20 buy point in a new cup with handle. The stock fell more than 1% to 34 in dull turnover.Apple replaced dividend-rich AT&T (T) in March 2015, when the latter traded near 33 a share. AT&T, which has been featured in IBD's Dividend Leaders screen, has made virtually no progress since then.GE had recently peaked at 33 in the summer of 2016 and now stands nearly 39% below that high. The stock's all-time peak is 60.50 back in August 2000.GE's Relative Price Strength Rating is a horrifying 7 on a scale of 1 to 99, as noted in IBD Stock Checkup. Certainly, pressure is mounting on GE's new management team, led by John Flannery, to reinvigorate growth. Flannery has served in many top posts at GE, including head of GE Capital and the India operations.The company's adjusted third-quarter earnings fell 4% to 26 cents a share, sharply missing Wall Street's view, according to data from William O'Neil + Co.Q3 revenue increased 14% to $33.47 billion, snapping a three-quarter slump. But GE has not seen a double-digit annual gain on the top line for more than nine years. The best result was a 6% rise in revenue to $182.5 billion back in 2008.Helping the Nasdaq's cause was Broadcom (AVGO), rising 8.33, or more than 3% to 261.23 in strong turnover. The chip designer for auto, telecom, data center and other markets has cleared a 259.46 buy point in a new nine-week flat base.The proper buy zone goes up 5% past that 259.46 buy point, or 272.43.Broadcom appears in IBD's real-time Stocks On The Move table, a great source for watchlist ideas and potential new breakouts. The table shows stocks moving sharply up or down in heavy volume, based on a real-time analysis of price-and-volume data, and can be seen on the home page.Back to Apple, earnings had dropped 10% in the fiscal year ended in September 2016, on an 8% slump in revenue. However, Apple has been staging a classic turnaround in fundamentals lately.In the past three quarters, the iMac maker's earnings rose 2%, 11% and 18% vs. year-ago levels, following a three-quarter slump. And in Q4 (ended in September), earnings are seen increasing 12% to $1.87 a share, which would mark a third quarter in a row of mild double-digit gains. It's slated to report Q4 results on Nov. 2 after the market close.For fiscal year 2019, the Street sees earnings accelerating 24% to $11.16 a share.Another positive for Apple shareholders: a respectable annualized dividend yield of 1.5%, with plenty of potential for  further increases in that cash payout. Apple tends to raise its dividend in the spring. But William O'Neil + Co. calculates that the company has a long-term annual dividend growth rate of 24% in recent years.IBD'S TAKE: The current yield of the S&P 500 is 1.87%. Track the yield and other vital market indicators by going to the special General Market Indicators page, available as a PDF link at Market Trend on Investors.com. The yield is posted on the top bar of the large daily chart of the S&P 500.Apple's SmartSelect Ratings have improved steadily throughout the year.On Jan. 1, the Composite Rating was dismal at 51 on a scale of 1 to 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The RS Rating, which compares a stock's 12-month price performance with all other companies in IBD's database, was equally dim at 59.But today, those two scores are now at 74 and 83, respectively. Expect the Composite Rating to be somewhat weaker when a stock such as Apple is undergoing a major turnaround in both fundamentals and in stock-price action.Elsewhere among the Dow Jones 30 components, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) is making what appears to be a normal-looking pullback after breaking out of a flat base at 137.18 on Oct. 17. The diversified medical and personal-care products titan has so far rallied as much as 5.2% from that proper entry, getting briefly extended from the correct buy point.J&J has posted single- to mild double-digit EPS gains for eight quarters in a row. The Street sees Q4 earnings rising 9% to $1.72 a share.The market reacted a tad negatively on reports that Congress is considering a phase-in pace toward lower corporate taxes. It's not the first time such a plan has been reported in the media. In any case, the market appears to be unwilling so far to give up much of its strong gains over the past five weeks.One big reason: U.S. GDP rose 3% in Q3 on an annualized basis, despite the enormous damage caused by hurricanes in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. That follows a 3.1% gain in Q2.While the Q3 GDP figure is bound to change in future data revisions, Eric Winograd, senior U.S. economist at AllianceBernstein, notes that investors should focus on the recent monthly data that point to an ""economy balanced among sectors.""""Each of personal consumption, private investment and net exports made a positive contribution to the headline rise, with the increase in private investment particularly noteworthy; it rose 4.2% year over year, the highest in two years,"" Winograd told IBD. ""We may not yet be back to pre-crisis levels of investment, but the news on that front is good.""Winograd also says consumption data point to an accelerating expansion in the U.S. economy.""I think of final sales to domestic purchasers, one of the subcategories of GDP, as essentially a 'core' measure — the single figure that best captures the underlying dynamics of the economy. With the (household) paycheck growing at about 4% YOY, the 4.1% YOY gain in final sales makes perfect sense,"" he added.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Apple In Buy Range; 2 New IPOs To WatchHow To Find Top Growth Stocks: Why The Cup With Handle Is A Money MakerWhen To Buy A Stock: Master This Key Growth Stock Chart PatternHow To Invest: Finding Great Stocks Inside IBD 50Top Stocks Today: Can This Chipmaker Rise Sharply Again On A New Breakout?Technology News: Nvidia Gets Another Price Target Hike

96,PFE,"Finding the best biotech companies to invest in can be tricky as volatility often pockmarks the space. Clinical plans don't always come to fruition and sometimes biotech stocks can suffer at the hands of regulatory decisions from the Food and Drug Administration.But the best biotech companies to invest in tend to have a commonality: A strong streak of earnings growth. As of June 2018, Investor's Business Daily's MarketSmith.com has two biotech stocks among a 150-strong list of the fastest growing stocks.Near the top of the list of fastest growing stocks, Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) is ranked eighth. Over the past five years, its earnings per share have grown a massive 147%, compared to 319% for the top-earning stock, Momo (MOMO), a Chinese social media firm.Supernus has made a name for itself among biotech stocks. Though in terms of market cap it still trails bigger biotech companies like Amgen (AMGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Biogen (BIIB) and Celgene (CELG). But Supernus lands itself on the list you might consider as the best biotech companies to invest in for strong metrics. As always, do your research before buying any stock, and be sure to check the company's stock chart to make sure it's the right time to buy.It has several years of double-digit quarterly sales growth with drugs that help disorders of the central nervous system. Among those, Supernus counts epilepsy drugs Oxtellar XR (extended-release) and Trokendi XR.Trokendi XR is also approved to prevent migraines. It rivals drugs like Botox from Allergan (AGN) and Amgen's Aimovig.Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) is unique among biotech stocks. Though IBD ranks it No. 144 out of 150 of the fastest growing stocks — which might put it on your research list for the possible best biotech companies to invest in — it doesn't market a single drug.Instead, Ligand acquires early-stage technologies necessary for drug development. It then licenses these platforms out to pharmaceutical companies like Dow Jones stocks Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE). As of June 2018, Ligand has a year of both double-digit sales and earnings growth under its belt.Ligand and Supernus both have IBD Composite Ratings of 99, meaning they perform in the top 1% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics.

97,PFE,"Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) were slammed Monday — continuing a two-day plunge — after Dow Jones component Pfizer (PFE) announced strong results for a competing rare-disease drug.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Alnylam toppled 15% to close at 101.18, though shares dove as much as 18.5%, close to a seven-month low. Shares ended Thursday's regular session down 8.3% after Pfizer announced the results for its drug called tafamidis.Needham analyst Alan Carr called Pfizer's results ""surprisingly positive.""""The outcome likely introduces another relevant competitor for Alnylam,"" Carr said in a note to clients. ""We believe an all-cause mortality benefit is compelling, and our assumption is that tafamidis could be approved in the U.S. in the second half of 2019.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut details are still thin. Pfizer studied tafamidis in transthyretin cardiomyopathy, which is tied to progressive heart failure. In the study, tafamidis significantly reduced all causes of death and the frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations.Transthyretin cardiomyopathy belongs to a family of rare diseases called transthyretin amyloidosis, or ATTR. In this class of diseases, proteins called amyloid build up on organs and can cause systemic damage. Cardiomyopathy patients experience heart effects.Alnylam and Ionis are both working on drugs to treat hereditary forms of ATTR. It's unknown now whether Pfizer could use its drug to treat more forms of ATTR, or just heart patients, analysts say.Ionis shares dropped 4.5% to close at 42.12 on Monday. Pfizer fell 1.2% to 35.05.Pfizer shared minimal data for its drug. An earlier study evaluated a 20-milligram dose of tafamidis, but the test failed. Significantly, tafamidis only slowed disease progression, Carr said. Alnylam's drug, called patisiran, has reversed the progression.It's also important to note a number of patients in a Phase 2 study of patisiran received Pfizer's tafamidis at the same time, Carr said. These patients showed similar benefits to those who received patisiran alone.""A possible implication is that patients should be treated with both drugs and that the market should not be viewed as 'either-or,' "" Carr said. He kept his buy rating and 152 price target on Alnylam shares.The recent Phase 3 study of tafamidis tested 20-milligram and 80-milligram doses of the drug vs. a placebo, Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young said in a note. The 80-milligram dose likely succeeded in transthyretin cardiomyopathy patients, she said.""We will be paying close attention to this new player in the market, including how the full data look and the commercial/pricing strategy in the cardiomyopathy space,"" she said. She also kept her outperform rating and 154 price target on Alnylam.Young currently models $2.5 billion in 2025 sales for patisiran. Patisiran will likely be the better option for patients who experience nerve damage as a result of amyloid buildup.""We don't assume full market penetration (for patisiran) due to the fact that we believe there are competitors like this one (Pfizer's tafamidis) and Ionis,"" she said.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersLooking For The Next Nvidia?

99,PFE,"The GOP fiscal hawks who want to pull the trigger on tax hikes if rosy growth projections don't pan out have the 20% corporate tax rate in their sites. So do the Senate Republican family-first duo of Sens. Marco Rubio and Mike Lee, who want to limit the corporate rate cut to 22% to pay for a more generous child tax credit.X After the Senate Budget Committee approved the GOP's near-$1.5 trillion tax cut Tuesday afternoon as some wavering Republicans voted to advance the legislation, it looked like a big victory for President Trump, the GOP and Corporate America might be at hand. But just a day later, it's looks like some risk of a watered-down corporate tax hike remains.The S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite all hit record highs Tuesday on the Senate tax bill's progress, but tech stocks reversed sharply lower on Wednesday, with Apple (AAPL) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) both slipping more than 2%.It's not clear that investors are especially worried about tax-cut prospects; the Dow tacked on more gains as financial stocks got a lift from rising market interest rates. Yet the sketchy details of Corker's trigger proposal do raise some risk. According to news reports, Corker's trigger could sop up an extra $350 billion in corporate tax revenue in the decade starting 2023 if budget targets aren't met.Here's what that might mean in practice. Under the Senate bill, corporations would get a $170 billion income-tax cut in 2027, but other corporate revenue raisers, such as reduced deductibility of interest payments, would reduce the net corporate tax cut to about $80 billion. The Corker trigger might claw back about $33 billion in that year, reducing the net corporate tax cut by roughly 40%.Meanwhile, the Rubio-Lee plan, which would make the $1,000 increase in the child tax credit refundable against payroll taxes to provide a benefit to working-class families who don't pay income taxes, poses further risk that the tax bill will change in ways that limit the upside for corporations.The White House has said that a 20% corporate rate is nonnegotiable, so the Rubio-Lee plan probably won't pass as written. An alternative way to pay for it might have the Senate follow the House lead in ratcheting up taxes on past earnings of multinationals that have been stashed overseas to avoid being taxed at the 35% U.S. corporate rate. The Senate would apply a 10% tax on cash and 5% on illiquid assets, raising $185 billion. The House's 14% tax on cash and 7% on illiquid assets would raise $293 billion. Apple held $252 billion in cash overseas at the end of its fiscal fourth quarter.IBD'S TAKE: The bull market won't go on forever, so read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.Two of the GOP holdouts, Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Steve Daines of Montana, are demanding a better deal for pass-through businesses, including sole proprietorships and partnerships, whose profits are taxed via individual returns. They've identified a source of funds — $100 billion-plus that could be raised by ending the deductibility of state and local income taxes for corporations — to pay for their demands.Johnson voted for the tax bill in committee on Tuesday, saying he wanted to ""move the process forward.""Their proposed fix would shift the rewards of the tax bill somewhat more in the direction of multinationals that make much of their profits overseas. Ending the deductibility of state and local income taxes probably won't mean much for Pfizer (PFE), which has regularly reported losses from U.S. operations and doesn't stand to gain much from a lower U.S. corporate rate. Yet tax analysts also have highlighted the Senate bill's foreign tax provisions, including a 12.5% minimum tax on income derived from intellectual property, as a big win for tech companies like Apple and Google, as well as drug companies like Pfizer.While all the attention has been on tax cuts, Republicans are about to have to shift their attention to keeping the government operating. The current funding authorization is set to expire on Dec. 8, and it's beginning to look doubtful that any Democrats will lend their votes. On Tuesday, Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi pulled out of a meeting with President Trump. While government funding and a renewal of the state Children's Health Insurance Program, which could soon be forced to impose cuts, are high priorities for Democrats, they also are eager to reach a resolution over so-called Dreamers, whose legal residence status will soon begin to lapse.RELATED:Broad Sell-Off Hits Tech As Apple, FANG Stocks Down; Telcos Rally5 Reasons Why JPMorgan, Citigroup, Other Financials Are Seizing Market LeadershipThe Republican Tax Bill Is Now In Serious Trouble$100 Billion Question: Will Trump Let Alphabet, Pfizer Keep Tax Havens?Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

100,PFE,"Headwinds slugged Pfizer's (PFE) Essential Health unit in the third quarter, leading the Dow component to report soft revenue and shares to dip to a seven-week low early Tuesday.XChief Executive Ian Read outlined the continued struggles facing Essential Health in a statement to investors. The unit posted a 12% yearly decline to $5.05 billion. It comprised 38% of Pfizer's total sales.""While Essential Health revenues remained challenged primarily due to continued headwinds from products that recently lost marketing exclusivity and product supply, we had solid operational growth in emerging markets and biosimilars,"" he said.In midday trading on the stock market today, Pfizer fell 0.6%, near 34.90, after earlier diving nearly 3% to a low last seen in mid-September. Meanwhile, the broader drug-stock group lifted 0.6%.For the third quarter, Pfizer reported adjusted profit of 67 cents, rising 10% and beating expectations by 2 cents. Sales of $13.168 billion edged up roughly 1%, but were just below analyst views for $13.169 billion.IBD'S TAKE: Pfizer has an IBD Composite Rating of 62 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it outperforms more than six in 10 stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But it still lags leaders like AbbVie, which has a CR of 95. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at the drug group's top performers.Innovative Health grew 11% to $8.12 billion. The business includes newer drugs that tend to yield higher sales for the company, including vaccines and those that treat cancer. Essential Health includes older, established pharmaceuticals.Consumer Healthcare sales of $829 million grew 4% and were in line with expectations, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a note to clients. Earlier this month, Pfizer said it's reviewing strategic options for that business, including selling it or a spinning it off.Pfizer noted its year-over-year growth suffered by 2%, or $281 million, due to the February divestiture of Hospira Infusion Systems. Excluding the impact of that divestiture, total sales would have grown 3%. Essential Health would have declined 7%.The firm also raised the midpoint of its adjusted earnings guidance by 3 cents to $2.58-$2.62 per share. Analysts had called for $2.56. It also narrowed its full-year sales outlook to $52.4 billion to $53.1 billion, from $52 billion to $54 billion, previously.Pfizer, which is in IBD's Dividend Leaders screen, pays a quarterly dividend of 32 cents a share. That represents an annualized yield of 3.7%.RELATED:Here's Why Trump's Tax Cuts Could Easily CollapseCould GlaxoSmithKline Scoop Up Pfizer's Over-The-Counter Unit?Dow Component Pfizer Mulls Over-The-Counter Spinoff Or Sale

The board also approved a $20 billion share buyback initiative.The gain put Wal-Mart shares in a buy range above an 80.57 buy point in a cup base.Dow issue Pfizer (PFE) rose 0.8% after announcing it was seeking strategic alternatives for its consumer health care business, which generated $3.4 billion in 2016 revenue. The drug giant said it expected to reach a determination on the matter in 2018.Pfizer shares are up 12% from an August low, in a possible base pattern begun in August 2016.Apple (AAPL) edged up 0.4% at the open. An analyst note from RBC Capital Markets said the iPhone maker is potentially one of the biggest beneficiaries of Trump administration plans for tax reform. RBC said Apple could see a $4 to $4.50 tailwind to its earnings per share, and clear the $1 trillion valuation level in 2018 if the policies are implemented.Apple shares stalled out of a September breakout attempt and are now forming a new base, with a possible buy point at 165.04.American Airlines Group surged 4% to breakout past a cup base buy point at 54.58. The airline boosted its third-quarter revenue per seat mile and pre-tax margin guidance, despite a heavy slate of flight cancellations caused by hurricanes in Texas and Florida. Tesla (TSLA) popped more than 2%, gaining ground after a Morgan Stanley note late Monday maintained the stock's equal-weight rating, but raised its price target to 379 from 317.Tesla shares dropped 4% in rising trade Monday, sending the stock back below its 10-week moving average.Tuesday's early high flier was biotech AnaptysBio (ANAB), which screamed 65% higher. The January new issue saw its first breakout from a base fail in July, then turned and gained 25% in September. Shares are now 285% above their January IPO price.IBD 50 name Ichor Holdings (ICHR) nailed an 8% opening leap. The provider of fluid delivery systems for semiconductor manufacturers announced late Monday a ""substantial"" agreement with one of its key customers. Ichor shares are extended beyond buy range from a 25.41 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.IBD 50 peer Nvidia (NVDA) snatched an early 3% advance, rising on news that the company had partnered with Deutsche Post DHL and automotive supplier ZF to release a test fleet of autonomous delivery trucks in 2018. Nvidia shares are extended after clearing a 174.66 flat base buy point on Sept. 15.Economic news was again minimal Tuesday. The National Federation of Independent Business released its September Small Business Optimism Index, which slipped to 103 from 105.3 and disappointed expectations for a slight increase.In addition, Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari is scheduled to speak at 10 a.m. ET.Asian stock markets were all back up and running today, with the Tokyo Stock Exchange reopened and the Nikkei 225 jumping 0.6%. Markets in China also carved higher, the Shanghai Composite gaining 0.3% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index stepping off a 0.6% gain.Europe's markets were mixed with London's FTSE 100 posting the strongest move, up 0.3% in afternoon trade.RELATED: The Big Picture: Indexes Slip, But These IBD 50 Stocks ShineDisney Releases New Trailer, Tickets For 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi'Move Over Techs, There's A New Sector Leader On Wall StreetThese 3 Travel Stocks Should Be On Investors' Q3 Watchlists

102,PFE,"Pfizer (PFE) will net a larger percentage of the prostate-cancer market, an analyst argued Thursday after the Dow component reported the results of a Phase 3 trial for a drug to treat the condition.XThe trial, dubbed Prosper, tested Xtandi in a population of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer that had not spread to other areas of the body. Pfizer got Xtandi in its $14 billion acquisition of Medivation last September.Evercore analyst Umer Raffat argues that the Prosper trial validates the Medivation deal.""Here's why this trial is so important,"" he wrote in a note to clients. ""It increases the target market size by perhaps more than double.""Xtandi is currently approved to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Raffat estimates that in the U.S. there's a pool of 20,000 patients with this form of prostate cancer in which it hasn't spread to other parts of the body.IBD'S TAKE: Pfizer has an IBD Composite Rating of 76 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it outperforms more than three-quarters of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stocks Checkup for a closer look at top-rated drugmakers.In the late-stage trial, Xtandi was both combined with androgen deprivation therapy and compared with androgen deprivation therapy, by itself. Xtandi met its goal of improving survival without allowing the cancer to spread.Still, this isn't the ""gold standard"" — which is overall survival, Raffat said.Based on these results, Pfizer and partner Astellas Pharma plan to discuss with the Food and Drug Administration the potential approval of Xtandi for all patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer, whether or not the cancer has spread.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Pfizer had gained 1.9% to close at35.73.RELATED:How Bristol-Myers' Cancer Win Helped Boost This RivalBristol Dives But 'Still Has A Chance' In Kidney Cancer: AnalystBiotech Fever Looks Frosty As These Players Cause Sectorwide Chills

103,PFE,"Stocks got slammed again Friday, as a major reversal sent key market index funds crashing to cap a very bad week.PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) plunged 2.3%, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) sank 2% and SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) gave up 1.6% in the stock market today. SPY fell to its 200-day moving average.On the Dow, Nike and Boeing held slim gains after rising 3% each intraday. They were the only two advancers. Athletic shoe giant Nike reported quarterly results late Thursday that topped views and offered a bullish outlook. But DowDuPont (DWDP), 3M (MMM) and Pfizer (PFE) lost more than 3% apiece.Big-cap techs showed continued weakness: Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) each fell 2% or more. Apple extended its slide for a sixth straight session and is now 10% off its high.Banks, semiconductor ad technology led the downside among sector funds. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH) tumbled 3% to take out its 50-day moving average. Dow component Intel fell 2.7%, while graphics chip designer Nvidia (NVDA) slid nearly 4% and rolled back below its 50-day line for the second time this week. Micron Technology (MU), which reported earnings late Thursday, was down nearly 8%.Investors flocked to a safe haven Thursday as technology and most other sectors got routed amid heightened trade war fears.Most equity ETFs saw losses. But Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) held on for a 0.4% gain and even managed to close above its 50-day moving average. The defensive ETF has been testing that support line the past week. When the market is in confirmed uptrend, a rebound off the 50-day can set up a potential buy opportunity. But when the uptrend is under pressure, all buys are at greater risk than usual.Also note that since late January, the 50-day line has been below the 200-day line. That's a bearish sign. However, the big tech sell-off begs the question: Is sector rotation occurring? Utilities and other defensive sectors tend to outperform when high-growth areas like tech underperform.XLU may also be shaping the bottom of a base as it continues to consolidate near the 50-day. The ETF is currently 13% off its 52-week high.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Electric utilities accounted for 62% of assets as of March 31, followed by 33% in multi-utilities. Independent power and renewable electricity producers made up nearly 3%, while water utilities represented just over 2%.Top holdings included NextEra Energy (NEE), Duke Energy (DUK) and Southern Co.

104,PFE,"Veeva Systems (VEEV) is a ""coiled spring"" ready to jump, thanks to several growth initiatives.XThat's the contention of Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis, who says Veeva stock has had a mighty run so far in 2018. He adds the cloud-computing firm that focuses on software applications for the pharmaceutical and life-sciences fields has room for further growth.In using the term ""coiled spring"" to describe Veeva's outlook, Davis says the future looks even more prosperous when 2019 comes into view.""Veeva has several growth initiatives in process that range from significant new feature upsells to adjacent customer breadth moves,"" Davis said in a recent note to clients.Pleasanton, Calif.-based Veeva has more than 600 customers in the life-sciences industry, ranging from Big Pharma firms to emerging biotechs.It counts companies like Amgen (AMGN), Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK), Novartis (NVS) and Pfizer (PFE) among its customers.Veeva went public in October 2013 at $20 a share, and hit an all-time high of 78.28 on March 8. It managed to avoid most of the carnage in this week's sell-off and shares were down 1% Friday to 74.30.Veeva stock broke out of a 38-week consolidation period with a buy point of 68.17 on Feb. 28, a day after the company posted better-than-expected results for the fiscal fourth quarter and gave guidance that crushed Wall Street's estimates for the current fiscal year.For its current fiscal year, which will end next Jan. 31, Veeva expects to earn an adjusted $1.32 a share, up 43% year over year, on sales of $818 million. That's up 19%, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Analysts were modeling adjusted profit of $1.01 a share on $807 million in sales.Veeva's growth initiatives are likely to reach sufficient scale this year to provide a path to upside to 2019 estimates, Davis said.""If this scenario is correct, investors will figure this out sometime this summer or fall at which point Veeva shares could sustainably move higher,"" he said. Davis rates Veeva stock as buy.Veeva began in 2007 with a software application to help pharmaceutical sales reps organize drug data to make stronger doctor pitches. Today, that product for customer relationship management — called Veeva CRM — dominates the drug market with roughly 80% user share. It's now part of Veeva's Commercial Cloud business.A big driver of the company's business today is Veeva Vault, which launched in 2011. It was created to organize all content involved in clinical drug trials — documents, patient data and work flow. Vault products now cover the clinical, quality, regulatory and commercial aspects of drug development, manufacturing and sale. It has penetrated less than 10% of the market, William Blair analyst Bhavan Suri told Investor's Business Daily.Veeva also has discovered that its Vault offering is useful for other heavily regulated industries, such as the chemical and consumer product sectors.The company's offering for companies outside of life sciences is called Vault QualityOne.

Its rivals include Oracle (ORCL), Medidata Solutions (MDSO), IQvia (IQV) and others.Veeva management has a strong track record of delivering growth and is conservative in its guidance, William Blair's Suri said. He rates Veeva stock as outperform.Veeva has forecast a revenue run rate of $1 billion by the fourth quarter of 2020.""We think they will hit that run rate by early next year — 18 months plus ahead of expectations,"" Suri said. ""Not only could they hit that billion-dollar run rate early next year, but the sustainability of growth should be there for the next two or three years.""Meanwhile, JPMorgan downgraded Veeva stock from overweight to neutral on March 9, citing valuation concerns after the stock had climbed 40% for the year.""This is a strong franchise that is executing well on a number of growth initiatives,"" but has little room for outperformance at current levels, JPMorgan analyst Sterling Auty said in his note to clients.He estimates Veeva's addressable market at about $5 billion, a fraction of the more than $50 billion spent each year by life-sciences companies on information technology.""This fertile market should provide greater than 20% growth in subscription revenue in fiscal 2019 after growing 26% in fiscal 2018,"" Auty said.RELATED:Veeva Rockets After Topping Quarterly Estimates, Crushing Guidance ViewsCEO Gassner Makes Sure Veeva Has A 'Second Act' — And More

105,PFE,"U.S. stock indexes posted solid gains midday Friday, as the Republicans scrambled to make final adjustments to the tax-cut bill. Volume was running higher on both major exchanges.X The small cap Russell 2000 led the way up with a 1.2% pop. The S&P 500, which struck a new high, and the Nasdaq advanced 0.8% and 0.9% respectively. Blue chips trailed the leaders as the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.6%.Volume in the stock market today is likely to be higher because of expirations. Friday is a quadruple witching day, which involves the expiration of stock index futures, stock index options, stock options and single stock futures.If the Republicans wrap up the tax-cut bill today, a vote could come early next week. This would give President Trump a chance to sign the bill into law before Christmas, the New York Times reported.For the stock market, the tax-cut legislation could be a driver in 2018. JPMorgan's top strategist Marko Kolanovic said in a note that ""The upcoming reduction of U.S. corporate tax rates may be one of the biggest positive catalysts for U.S. equities this cycle."" Kolanovic is convinced that ""little is priced into the market.""The big question now is sector rotation. There are several ways to scan for sectors rising and falling. A thorough check might involve looking at which sectors are providing the most new highs; the industry group tables; sector rankings in IBD's stock tables; and breakouts.Blue chips were up, except for IBM (IBM) which fell 1% in strong volume. In the Dow Jones industrial average, leaders included drugmaker Pfizer (PFE), up 1.8%; insurer Travelers (TRV), up 1.8%; and money center JPMorgan Chase (JPM), up 1.5%.In the S&P 500, apparel stock the class C shares of Under Armour (UA) gapped up 11% as it reclaimed its 50-day line. The stock is a laggard and remains 50% off its high. The Street expects earnings to decline 73% in 2017, but then rebound 63% in 2018.Under Armour's pretax margin has narrowed in each of the past three years through 2016 — 11.2%, 11.1%, 9.8% and 8.1%. The apparel industry group, though, has risen from No. 93 six weeks ago to No. 26 among 197 stock groups.Advancing issues in the IBD 50 led declining issues by a roughly 4-to-1 ratio. The Innovator IBD 50 Fund (FFTY), an exchange-traded fund that mirrors the IBD 50, rose 0.7%. The fund broke out in August and is about 9% above the 30.23 buy point.

106,PFE,"Invest in the disruptors.That's the advice from Wall Street, as giant biotech companies and the incumbents of Big Pharma are bracing to get crushed by more innovative — and cheaper — new drugs.X What started in 2017 will continue in 2018, analysts say. Generic drug approvals are rising and interesting new medicines are starting to take market share from the legacy makers of medications that consumers use frequently, including both Big Pharma and biotech companies.Blockbuster drugs representing an estimated $17 billion in annual sales are set to lose patent protection over the next decade, analysts say. Disruption will come as generic drugs and innovative new biologic alternatives come on the market.""It will be brutal,"" JMP Securities analyst Mike King told Investor's Business Daily. ""It will be a knife fight.""In the market for cholesterol-lowering drugs, King expects Amgen (AMGN), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) to feel the heat from the likes of Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR), The Medicines Co. (MDCO) and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY).Meanwhile, in anti-inflammatory treatments, Celgene's (CELG) Otezla, which gained blockbuster status in 2016, missed sales forecasts by a wide cut in the third quarter. Analysts say newly approved drugs to treat the same conditions from Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novartis (NVS) are taking market share.Gilead Sciences (GILD) is still feeling the pain from the maturing of its hepatitis C drug unit in the U.S. and Europe. The rapid pace of Gilead's hepatitis C sales decline is expected to slow down somewhat, but newer medicines like AbbVie's (ABBV) Mavyret are likely to swipe some of its sales.Big Pharma isn't getting any help from regulators either. Food and Drug Administration head Scott Gottlieb will continue to increase approvals for copycat drugs, stoking competition for both branded and generic drugs facing new rivals as firms try to undercut one another in price.Among the Big Pharma companies, Pfizer (PFE) will be at the forefront feeling the sting of generics taking sales. Earlier this month, Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) was allowed to launch a generic copy of the blockbuster erectile dysfunction drug Viagra.Generic drugs tend to be cheaper than their branded counterparts and Viagra is a pricey drug at about $70 per tablet, according to AccessRX. In 2013, after Pfizer lost exclusivity for Viagra in Canada and Europe, worldwide sales fell 8% to $1.88 billion.Today, generics in Europe have slashed the price of drugs containing the same active ingredient as Viagra by about 90%. Generic versions of Viagra cost about a third of the price in Canada. U.S. Viagra prices could also fall if the trend repeats itself with a generic on the market.Teva, meanwhile, is struggling with $34.7 billion in debt as of the end of the third quarter. On Thursday, Teva announced a plan to cut its workforce by more than a quarter, close several manufacturing facilities and suspend its dividend on ordinary shares.The firm is also planning to review its generic drug portfolio, most specifically in the U.S., to change prices or discontinue products.IBD'S TAKE: See how giant biotechs fared vs. smaller players in the third quarter by visiting the Industry Snapshot. Hint: The quarter was classified as ""alarming"" for one large-cap biotech which could be in trouble as they see more competition for their traditional moneymakers.Across the board, spending on prescription drugs in 2016 increased by just 3.8% per person, according to a report from Express Scripts (ESRX). That's down from a 5.2% rise in 2015, representing a 27% drop in the growth rate.That trend is likely to continue in 2018, FBB Capital Partners analyst Mike Bailey told IBD. He credits Gottlieb for the decline in generic prices. Gottlieb is running the FDA like a business, which allows for a cycle of more approvals, more competition and lower prices.Although the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services could use their tools to influence pricing, it's unlikely President Trump will use his executive powers to enact sweeping drug-pricing reform such as allowing Medicare to negotiate prices or enacting outright pricing controls, Bailey says.""I wouldn't expect any major changes out of the Trump administration in pricing,"" he said. ""I think mechanically and politically it's difficult to get pricing law through the system. It's politically more acceptable to just get more generic drug approvals. It's a win-win.""JMP's King counts drugs that treat rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis as among those in the ""crowded areas."" In 2016, drugs in this class cost an average $3,588 per prescription and benefited from increases in utilization and unit cost, according to Express Scripts.But in the third quarter of 2017, things began to look dour for the likes of Celgene, which missed expectations for its inflammation drug Otezla by 26%. In the U.S., the lag was even sharper at 28%. One analyst suggested Celgene was forced to take a price concession.Celgene also cut its guidance for 2020 after terminating trials of a drug to treat Crohn's disease, a condition that results from chronic inflammation in the digestive tract. It now sees inflammation and immunology drugs bringing in a combined $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion in 2020, down from the $4 billion outlook it issued in 2015.Biotech companies and Big Pharma will need to ""get realistic"" on their pricing in these competitive arenas, King says. The same could be said for companies making treatments for hepatitis C, multiple sclerosis and high cholesterol. All are highly saturated markets.To the latter point, he expects prices for drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors like Repatha from Amgen and Praluent from Regeneron and Sanofi to be under the microscope. These drugs lower bad LDL cholesterol in the blood. Evidence shows they also have a benefit on some cardiovascular outcomes.Repatha is listed at $14,100 per year, while Praluent costs $14,600. But rivals are closing in. Medicines Co. and Alnylam are working on another cholesterol drug, known as inclisiran. Meanwhile, analysts expect bempedoic acid from Esperion to be cheaper.Some of these Big Pharma and biotech companies ""are probably going to get their arms twisted a lot,"" King said. ""The pricing umbrella has created opportunities for new companies to come in and scale market share. Be careful if you own incumbents. Invest in the disruptors.""Other areas are seemingly immune to pricing pressure, analysts say.In 2016, the price of multiple sclerosis drugs rose an average 7.4%. That's a continuing trend, FBB's Bailey said. The price increases have been so egregious that House Democrats launched an investigation in August, noting that many of these drugs carry price tags north of $85,000 per year.The investigation was launched by Reps. Elijah Cummings and Peter Welch and centers on Bayer (BAYRY), Biogen (BIIB), EMD Sereno, Novartis, Roche (RHHBY), Sanofi and Teva.Among those pharmaceutical and biotech companies, Teva's 20-milligram dose of Copaxone has increased the most, rising 1,002% since its approval in 1996 to an annual price of $91,401 today, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Novartis' Gilenya, approved in 2010, is the highest priced at $91,836.The investigation is ""10 years too late,"" he said. ""It's more difficult to push price control for specialty markets. Multiple sclerosis is a massive market now, but stakeholders view it as a specialty market.""Rare disease and innovative cancer therapies also seem immune to pricing controls, analysts say. For example, earlier this year Novartis and Gilead — via its acquisition of Kite Pharma — gained approval for CAR-T drugs known as Kymriah and Yescarta, respectively.CAR-T drugs are developed using a patient's own immune system cells. They are trained to seek out and destroy cancer cells. Kymriah goes for $475,000 per year and Yescarta is listed at $373,000, ARK Invest analyst Manisha Samy wrote in a recent post.""While gene therapies are beginning to cure cancer, they come at a price that can cause sticker stock,"" she said. ""That said, compared to traditional therapies that suppress, but do not cure cancer, the cost benefit analysis of gene therapy is compelling.""Pricing shock tends to tamp down on excitement for really compelling drugs, Bailey says. The prime example is Biogen and Ionis Pharmaceuticals' (IONS) Spinraza, the first spinal muscular atrophy drug approved. It costs $750,000 in its first year and $375,000 in subsequent years.But sentiment for the biotech companies' shares is already down, he said. So drug pricing concerns shouldn't be a big stock killer in 2018.""In the past when biotech stocks go up quickly, they get new drugs and people are excited, a lot of times someone will throw in a grenade: 'What about drug pricing?'"" Bailey said. ""But sentiment is already down. Even if there's a concern about drug pricing, I see a little less downside.""IBD's 462-company Biotech industry group is now ranked No. 34 out of 197 groups tracked, and has fallen from first just two months ago. Shares collectively neared a two-year high in October, but have since shucked almost 7% from that point.Over that same time, Amgen and Celgene — among the biggest biotechs — have seen their share prices dive 9% and 26%, respectively. Regeneron has taken a 19% hit and Gilead has tumbled 14%.Meanwhile, Alnylam and Esperion, which look likely to rival PSCK9 inhibitor drugmakers like Amgen and Regeneron, have lifted 7% and 5%, respectively. AbbVie, which recently launched a rival to Gilead's hepatitis C franchise, is up 5%.But Novartis and Lilly, which are competing against Celgene to treat inflammatory conditions, have seen their shares retreat, though to a smaller degree. Respectively, their share prices are down 1% and 2%, matching a 1% dip in IBD's 42-company Ethical Drugs industry group.Generic drug stocks, ranked No. 105 out of 197 groups, have actually broadly risen 2% since mid-October. But that's against respective 8% and 5% dips for Teva and Mylan (MYL), its two biggest names.RELATED:Teva's Restructuring Plan: Another Case Of Been Here, Done That?Generic Drug Makers Face Pricing Issues That Other Pharmas Don'tTop 6 Biotech Companies In Innovation Earn Recognition In New Awards

107,PFE,"It's looking increasingly clear that the only way the GOP will be able to make a 20% corporate tax rate permanent is with a $1 trillion-plus tax hike on individuals in the decade starting 2028.XOn Monday, the House GOP tax-cut bill had a gulf of more than $1.25 trillion between the cost of a 20% corporate rate and the offsetting corporate revenue-raisers in the second decade.By the end of Tuesday, that gulf had widened to about $1.5 trillion, after the House Ways and Means Committee gutted one of its biggest proposals to help pay for a corporate tax cut, a 20% excise tax on payments from businesses in the U.S. to other affiliates of the same company overseas.The dream of a permanent 20% rate may have died when Wal-Mart (WMT) and other retailers successfully killed the idea of a 20% border-adjustment tax on imports that would have raised $1 trillion in the first decade (but might have run afoul of the World Trade Organization). Profit-shifting by companies such as Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Pfizer (PFE) to low-tax jurisdictions is estimated to cost the U.S. government $100 billion a year in lost revenue, but the House tax bill's measure to discourage such practices through a 10% tax on high foreign returns would raise just $8 billion in 2027.While the GOP can push through tax cuts that add $1.5 trillion to the deficit in the first decade, the plan can't add to deficits beyond 2027 to meet Senate budget reconciliation rules allowing for passage with just 50 votes — and no Democrats.The GOP hasn't shown its cards regarding the decision about which tax cuts will be made permanent and which will expire, but it did flash a warning sign last week. On the afternoon before the House revealed its Tax Cut and Jobs Act, top tax writer Kevin Brady said that the 20% corporate rate would have to be temporary, prompting S&P 500 index futures to slide.Miraculously, Brady reversed course late that same evening. With a permanent corporate rate cut once again supposedly in the cards, investors exhaled, and markets resumed their ascent. Yet, the numbers revealed the next day didn't add up, and they're even further from adding up now.There's been talk for a few months that individual tax cuts would have to expire to meet Senate budget rules. But the prospect of a trillion-dollar tax hike on individuals to pay for corporate tax cuts is a much more dicey political calculation, and Brady's flip-flop suggests that Republicans are understandably reluctant to go there.The results of Tuesday's elections in Virginia, characterized as a ""bloodbath"" for Republicans by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Washington analyst Brian Gardner, will only add to pressure on Republicans ""to adopt a more populist approach to the bill, which means less tax relief on the corporate side and more relief for individuals, especially among lower income levels.""IBD'S TAKE: The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 23,550 on Tuesday, up 1,650 points since IBD changed its market trend indicator on Aug. 22 to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a yellow light turning green. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. Beyond political considerations, a strategy to pay for massive corporate tax cuts with individual tax hikes could jeopardize the votes of a handful of Senate Republicans who have said they don't want the plan to add to the deficit. While the GOP can seek to provide assurance that Congress will never actually let the individual tax cuts expire, the implication is that deficits would be much higher in the long run.Senate Republicans may reveal their own tax-cut legislation by Friday, so the sleeper issue of sunsetting tax cuts turning to tax hikes may soon be front and center.Already, Senate Republicans are signaling that they may delay cutting the corporate tax rate for a year to direct more of the $1.5 trillion in budget space to individual tax cuts.Anything short of a permanent corporate tax cut would have to be judged a failure, at least by the standard House Speaker Paul Ryan offered in August. ""Businesses aren't doing multibillion-dollar, multiyear capital decisions if they see a tax code that's unpredictable,"" Ryan said in August. ""The big decision-making provisions in the tax code — that stuff's got to be permanent.""A temporary, deficit-financed corporate tax cut also would likely be judged a failure by economists, meaning it would do nothing to boost growth, except in the very short term, and might be judged to shrink the economy by raising the cost of capital.Both political pressures and Senate budget rules seem highly unlikely to produce a permanent 20% corporate tax rate. A number of Wall Street strategists have highlighted a 25% corporate rate as a more feasible fallback, and they may be right. However, even that won't be simple to get done.For one thing, if Congress adopts a 25% corporate tax rate, instead of 20%, companies would have a bigger incentive to shift income to low-tax foreign jurisdictions, yet the GOP is already struggling to figure out how to keep companies from capitalizing on rate disparities.Secondly, even a 25% tax rate would require a tax hike of a half-trillion or more on individuals in the second decade, unless the GOP is able to come up with more offsetting tax increases on business. Yet with a more moderate rate cut to 25%, the pushback from corporations can be expected to intensify.RELATED:IBD/TIPP Poll: Economic Optimism Rises, But It's Mainly High-EarnersThe House GOP Tax Bill Has A Big-Family Problem$100 Billion Question: Will Trump Let Alphabet, Pfizer Keep Tax Havens?These Are The Biggest Losers From Trump's Tax ReformStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

109,PFE,"AbbVie's (ABBV) Humira franchise is safe through 2023 after a patent settlement with Amgen (AMGN), an analyst said Monday as he upgraded AbbVie and predicted that its profits would outgrow other large-cap pharmas through 2021.XLeerink analyst Geoffrey Porges upgraded AbbVie to an outperform rating and upped his price target to 106 from 89. He noted that the upgrade missed AbbVie's recently strong performance, but ""we believe that there is still further upside.""""Our valuation for AbbVie is altered based on extending the U.S. market exclusivity for Humira in our model to 2023, from 2020-21 previously after the settlement with Amgen,"" he wrote in a note to clients.Under the settlement, Amgen will pay AbbVie royalties on sales of its Humira copycat. Humira is AbbVie's most important drug, bringing in 69% of total sales in the second quarter. Humira is an anti-inflammatory med.By the closing bell on the stock market today, AbbVie climbed 1.7% to finish at 90.39. Shares broke out of a flat base at a 75.14 buy point in late August, and have risen 18.3% since hitting that point.IBD'S TAKE: AbbVie is also working with Galapagos to develop treatments for cystic fibrosis. But analysts say Vertex Pharmaceuticals has a large lead. Head to The New America for a closer look at the market breakdown.The settlement allows Amgen to launch a biologic copy of Humira, known as Amgevita, in Europe next October. Its U.S. version, Amjevita, is set to launch in January 2023. Other rivals ""are likely to be offered the same 2023 market entry deal,"" Porges said.Boehringer Ingelheim and Coherus Biosciences (CHRS) are closest to entry with biologic copies of Humira. Boehringer's Cyltezo was approved in August, but the firm is in a patent battle with AbbVie. Coherus is still working to submit its application to U.S. regulators.Dow components Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE), in addition to Novartis (NVS) and Momenta Pharmaceuticals (MNTA), are bound to file for approval of biologic copies of Humira in the coming quarters, but these will likely infringe on AbbVie's Humira patents.Any lawsuits would likely be resolved around mid-2022, removing the risk of a launch until right before the 2023 settlement date, Porges said. ""As a result, we believe the certainty of U.S. Humira patent protection until 2023 is nearly 100%.""Porges increased his 2018-19 Humira sales views by 1%-2%. Longer term, his Humira estimates increased 8% and 46% in 2020 and 2021, respectively. He expects AbbVie to hit 49%-50% operating margin from 2019-21.He projects AbbVie 2017-21 earnings per share commanding an annual growth rate of 15%, topping large-cap pharma peers projected at 11% and mature biopharmas set for mid-single-digit growth.""The growth horizon, along with the company's increasingly visible late-stage pipeline, suggests that AbbVie stock should continue to re-rate into the range of these large-cap biopharma peers,"" Porges said.RELATED:Why Amgen's Drug Win Sent AbbVie Stock Into The StratosphereThese Companies Gain If Trump's Foreign Profit Relief Plan PassesAbbVie's New Hepatitis C Drug Chipping Away At Gilead's Share

110,PFE,"AbbVie (ABBV) launched to a record high Thursday after it settled a patent dispute with Amgen (AMGN) that will require the No. 1 biotech to pay AbbVie royalties on sales of its Humira copycat.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, AbbVie popped 5%, near 88.96, though in earlier trades shares were up as much as 7.3% to a record high of 90.95. Amgen stock lifted fractionally to close at 185.46.Per the settlement, Amgen's drug known as Amgevita will launch in Europe in October 2018. Its U.S. version, Amjevita, will launch in January 2023. The drug is a biosimilar of AbbVie's drug Humira, an anti-inflammatory med. A biosimilar is a biologic copy of a drug.Amgen will pay royalties to AbbVie, though the specific terms are confidential, AbbVie said in a news release. All litigation pending between the two will be dismissed. AbbVie will grant patent licenses to Amgen on a country-by-country basis.Humira is AbbVie's most important drug, bringing in 69% of total sales in the second quarter ended June 30. Ten other drug firms are working on Humira biosimilars, including Biogen (BIIB), Novartis (NVS), Dow's Pfizer (PFE) and Mylan (MYL), Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: AbbVie and Galapagos are also working together on cystic fibrosis drugs. But Vertex Pharmaceuticals says it has a strong lead and analysts don't disagree. Head to The New America for a breakdown on the market and why Vertex is leading the pack.The consensus is calling for Amgen's Humira biosimilar, the first approved, to bring in $748 million in worldwide sales in 2025, up from just $50 million in 2018 when it's set to launch in Europe. Still, there are patents remaining that AbbVie could use to extend litigation, Raffat said.But RBC analyst Kennen MacKay boosted his views for success for Amgevita/Amjevita to 95% from 65%. He expects Amgen's drug to penetrate at its peak 30% and 50% of the Humira biosimilar markets in the U.S. and Europe, respectively.MacKay models peak global sales of Amgevita/Amjevita hitting $928 million in 2032. On a sales share basis, he expects Amgen to have 20% of the Humira biosimilar market, depending on royalty rates. He kept a sector perform rating and 192 price target on Amgen.RELATED:Biotechs Beating The Market, But Are They In Buy Range?These Companies Gain If Trump's Foreign Profit Relief Plan PassesWhy Amgen, Lilly, J&J Are Interested In These Small BiotechsAbbVie's New Hepatitis C Drug Chipping Away At Gilead's Share

111,PFE,"Exchange traded funds' popularity keeps growing as investors plow money into the popular low-cost vehicles that offer access to a basket of stocks.X And that trend doesn't appear to be waning. The combined assets of U.S. ETFs surged to $3.6 trillion in January, according to the Investment Company Institute, up 38% from a year ago. And the total number of U.S. ETFs rose 7% to 1,853 from January 2017.In the 25 years since the launch of the very first ETF, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), there are now some 2,000 funds available across a variety of categories and styles.To gain further insight into ETFs, their potential benefits and growth outlook, we checked in with Todd Rosenbluth, senior director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA. Before CFRA acquired S&P Global in 2016, Rosenbluth was director of ETF and mutual fund research in the U.S. for S&P Capital IQ. His previous experience includes managing editor of Value Line Mutual Fund Survey and financial advisor at Morgan Stanley.The full interview with Rosenbluth, who also discusses current trends in the ETF space, follows:IBD: Should an investor own ETFs, and why?Rosenbluth: Investors who want exposure to the stock or bond market should look to ETFs, which typically provide low-cost exposure to a broad investment category or a narrower thesis with the benefits of diversification and transparency. For example, rather than own just Merck (MRK), investors in Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) or Fidelity MSCI Health Care Index ETF (FHLC) would hold Merck; its peers, including Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Pfizer (PFE); and companies in other related industries, including Medtronic (MDT) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH). Unlike in an actively managed mutual fund, investors can see daily what's in an ETF and determine if they think it continues to fit their portfolio.IBD: Are there too many ETFs out there?Rosenbluth: Approximately one-third of CFRA-rated ETFs came to market since March 2015. So we think (that before investing) investors should determine whether an ETF serves a legitimate investing purpose. If so, it's more likely to gain sufficient assets to be viable.Keep in mind that CFRA rates far more mutual funds than ETFs, with several dozen asset managers offering similar-sounding products. Given the sentiment shift toward lower-cost ETFs and away from more expensive mutual funds, CFRA expects more mutual funds to be closed or merged in response.Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!IBD: What do you think could fuel further ETF growth — and what could hinder growth?Rosenbluth: Investor and advisor adoption of ETFs designed to support their asset-allocation needs is going to further drive ETF growth. Vanguard S&P 500 (VOO) or iShares Core MSCI EAFE (IEFA) are examples of such well-diversified products. As more investors gain comfort with ETFs, money will continue to flow into both established and up-and-coming products.Some investors will always favor the mutual-fund wrapper, wanting active management. To address this, many large asset managers including Davis Funds, Legg Mason, PIMCO and Vanguard offer actively managed ETFs — another area of potential growth.IBD: Even though factor-based ETFs aren't new, ""smart beta"" continues to be a buzzword. What has contributed to the rising popularity of smart-beta funds?Rosenbluth: As actively managed mutual funds struggle to keep up with the returns of the S&P 500 or the MSCI EAFE index, investors are seeking an alternative. Smart-beta ETFs launched in the last three years, including popular Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity (GSLC) and iShares Edge MSCI MultiFactor USA ETF (LRGF), combine factor approaches to offer a diversified yet lower cost approach to quantitative investing.Here again, many large asset managers have expanded their ETF presence using smart-beta products in response to growing demand. In the last six months, JPMorgan U.S. Minimum Volatility (JMIN), Oppenheimer Russell 1000 Low Volatility Factor (OVOL) and USAA MSCI USA Value Momentum Blend Index ETF (ULVM) have launched. All of these are covered by CFRA Research.IBD: ESG (environmental, social and governance) funds have been in the news too. Do you think that's a lasting trend?Rosenbluth: ESG mutual fund assets have been quite sticky, even as many actively managed mutual funds slowly bleed assets in favor of index-based ETFs. We expect over time, ESG ETFs will gain traction as investors further embrace ETFs and put money to work focused on the conviction of their values.IBD: Any new trends you're seeing now?Rosenbluth: We're seeing investors look more closely at thematic ETFs. Unlike traditional sector or well-diversified ETFs, these ETFs focus on robotics, blockchain or other potentially long-term investment trends. These more narrowly constructed products — such as Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence (BOTZ), ROBO Global Robotics & Automation Index (ROBO), Reality Shares NASDAQ Nexgen Economy (BLCN) and Innovation Shares NextGen Protocol ETF (KOIN) — tend to charge a premium price relative to market-cap-weighted ETFs, but as more asset managers compete for investor interest, fees have and will continue to move lower.IBD: Which types of ETFs do you expect to outperform as interest rates rise?Rosenbluth: With equity ETFs, CFRA thinks more economically sensitive sectors, including financials and industrials, should benefit if rates rise due to a strong U.S. economy. Vanguard Financials Index ETF (VFH) and iShares Transportation Average (IYT) are a couple of examples.In addition, as interest rates rise, CFRA is focused on bond ETFs with limited interest-rate sensitivity. These low-duration products reduce the downside impact as the Federal Reserve raises rates. IShares 0-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond (SHYG) and SPDR Bloomberg Barclays Short Term High Yield Bond ETF (SJNK) are examples of short-term ETFs rated favorably by CFRA.IBD: Given the Feb. 5 market sell-off and early redemption of VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN (XIV), what are your thoughts on VIX-tied volatility ETFs? Are they appropriate for any type of investors?Rosenbluth: VIX-based products are not rated by CFRA as we focus on ETFs that directly hold stocks or bonds and not derivatives. However, investors need to understand that inverse and leveraged ETFs can aggressively move without warning and losses can pile up quickly.IBD: Does XIV's early redemption mean it's harder for investors to manage risk — and if so, how does that affect how the market operates?Rosenbluth: XIV was an exchange traded note, not a traditional ETF as are the other products we've talked about. With ETNs, investors need to understand that there is issuer risk to consider on top of the usual investment risks. With an ETF that shuts down, investors get fair warning and can understand what's inside the portfolio. This helps them track what they will receive if they hold until the product closes. With XIV, the mechanics were much different and the road to closure was much shorter.It's important to note, however, that what happened with XIV was spelled out in its prospectus. So this is less an example of a larger market issue and more an example of why investors need to know exactly what they're getting involved with, particularly with leveraged, inverse and volatility products.IBD: What is a sound strategy for a long-term investor in ETFs?Rosenbluth: Long-term investors should regularly review what's inside the ETFs they're holding to understand how the securities fit going forward. Investors should also periodically rebalance their assets as positions do not move up or down in tandem. You should not necessarily stand still even with passively managed ETFs.IBD: How does CFRA assess ETFs — and how does that differ from other industry researchers?Rosenbluth: CFRA provides a forward-looking rating on more than 1,300 ETFs, combining holdings analysis with fund attributes, including expense ratio and technical analysis. What's inside an ETF and how much it costs is a bigger driver of future returns than its three-year track record or how well it tracks a typically unique index. ETFs that rate favorably to CFRA do so because we have confidence in the valuation and risk considerations of the holdings. We also compare ETFs with one another and separate from mutual funds, as the relevant metrics differ, while others compare active mutual funds trying to beat the S&P 500 with ETFs such as SPDR S&P 500 that seeks to replicate the index.Since our equity ETF ratings launched nearly 10 years ago, under the S&P Global umbrella, our top-rated ETFs have outperformed the S&P 500 index and the bottom-rated ETFs have underperformed. S&P Equity and Fund Research was acquired by independent research provider CFRA Research in late 2016.

But the spotlight economic news is scheduled for 2 p.m. ET, when the Federal Reserve announces any policy changes from its two-day meeting. A press conference with Fed Chair Janet Yellen follows at 2:30 p.m. ET.After months of well-telegraphed intentions, the Fed is today expected to announce a gradual shift from the neutral stance of holding bonds to being a seller as it begins to trim $4.5 trillion in debt from its balance sheet. The move points to declining bond prices and rising yields which, in turn, should drive up interest rates across the economy.The expectations have been a positive for banks and other credit and financial institutions, the leading beneficiaries of rising interest rates. All seven of the banking industry groups tracked by IBD turned from declines to solid gains over the past four weeks. The Midwest banks group led, with a 4% gain, followed by foreign banks, up 3.6%, and West/Southwest banks, up 3.5%.Building products, oil and gas, and heavy construction industry groups have posted the strongest gains over the past four weeks among the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD.Pfizer (PFE) surged to the top of the Dow, up 1.7% after an upgrade to overweight, from equal weight, from Piper Jaffray. Pfizer remains in a buy range, above a 34.58 buy point in a two-month flat base.

A Piper Jaffray report based on Google search data suggested Netflix could easily surpass its subscriber growth targets when it reports third-quarter earnings in October.  Netflix, an IBD Leaderboard stock, is climbing the right side of a flat base with a 191.60 buy point.Amazon was reported to be working on its first Alexa-powered smart glasses device. The wearable computer would rely on a bone-conduction systems, avoiding the need for speakers or headphones, the Financial Times reported. Also an IBD Leaderboard stock, Amazon is in a flat base with a 1083.41 buy point.Important earnings results reported late Tuesday included Adobe Systems (ADBE), FedEx (FDX) and Bed, Bath & Beyond (BBBY).Adobe dropped 5%, despite beating fiscal third-quarter sales and earnings expectations. Management's fourth-quarter guidance was mixed, however. The IBD 50 stock has been extended, trading near new highs and well above its 10-week line of support.FedEx dipped 0.4% after a cyberattack and Hurricane Harvey chewed into its fiscal first-quarter results. Shares have been holding above 10-week support, in a two-month flat base.Bed, Bath & Beyond was all wet, diving 15% after reporting a harsh miss of earnings, revenue and same-store sales targets in its second-quarter results.

118,PFE,"Shares of Dow's Pfizer (PFE) tumbled Tuesday after sales from a breast cancer drug lagged expectations, though the fourth quarter culminated with a beat-and-raise, including a ""dramatically improved"" 17% tax rate.X By the closing bell on the stock market today, Pfizer dove 3.1% to 37.80. Meanwhile, drug stocks broadly dipped 1.4% on uncertainty after Amazon (AMZN), Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) announced a collaboration to lower healthcare costs in the U.S.For its fourth quarter, Pfizer reported $716 million in sales of Ibrance, which is approved to treat some breast cancer patients. Sales grew 11.4% year over year, but missed the forecast of Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez for $955 million.Ibrance sales declined internationally in the period due to a one-time price adjustment in some European markets, Pfizer said in a news release. Despite this, Ibrance volumes grew 20% sequentially in developed Europe.Still, ""Ibrance's growth was a disappointment and highlights the need for international growth as investors await the outcome of the ongoing adjuvant breast cancer studies,"" Fernandez said in a note to clients.More broadly, Pfizer brought in adjusted income of 62 cents per share on sales of $13.7 billion for its fourth quarter, rising 32% and 1%, respectively. Both metrics beat the consensus for adjusted profit of 56 cents a share on $13.61 billion in revenue.Fernandez called the fourth-quarter beat ""largely irrelevant,"" instead focusing on 2018 guidance for $53.5 billion to $55.5 billion in sales and adjusted earnings of $2.90-$3 a share. The consensus had modeled $53.72 billion and $2.77, respectively.IBD'S TAKE: Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Gilead Sciences and Vertex Pharmaceuticals are expected to top fourth-quarter expectations while others continue struggling with rivals facing their biggest moneymaking drugs. Head to IBD Industry Themes for more on what the fourth-quarter earning season could hold.Pfizer also guided to a 17% tax rate in 2017. Investors should have expected the lower tax guidance, Fernandez says. In December, the president signed a massive tax cut on corporations into law. Last week, AbbVie (ABBV) guided to a low 9% tax rate.""Key questions on the call likely will focus on the sustainability of the 17% tax rate,"" Fernandez said. ""How — if the consumer business is sold — management plans to deploy the capital and what the after-tax impact might be to Pfizer's cash hoard.""Investors will also look for commentary on whether Pfizer will split its company with or without large-scale mergers and acquisitions, he said. Pfizer says it will have a decision sometime this year on whether it will sell its consumer healthcare business.During the quarter, consumer healthcare sales were flat at $950 million. Sales of cholesterol drug Lipitor grew nearly 23.7% to $574 million, above estimates for $465 million. Xeljanz, a rheumatoid arthritis drug, brought in $410 million, growing 47.5%.RELATED:Gilead Stock Broke Out On AbbVie's Earnings — Here's WhyWhy This Biopharma 'Behemoth' Could Soon Become AcquisitiveWhy Insurers Haven't — And Won't — Push Back On Rare Disease Drugs

119,PFE,"Investors showed a little bit of fear about the prospects for four, and not three, quarter-point rate hikes following the first testimony to Congress by new Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell, with stocks trading solidly lower heading into the final half hour.Powell said in prepared remarks that the U.S. central bank ""will continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheating economy and bringing ... price inflation to 2% on a sustained basis.""Meanwhile, top growth stock Arista Networks (ANET) just edged lower Tuesday afternoon after retaking its key 50-day moving average on Monday. The software-centric data center networking gear specialist was down 0.2%, far better than the broader market.Arista, which reported stellar Q4 results a little more than a week ago (EPS up 64%, revenue up 43%, net margin of 29.3%, up 670 basis points vs. a year ago), needs to try to form a new base after triggering a sell signal Feb. 16. Shares are just 16% below an all-time high of 311.67, when the stock had a market cap of just over $23 billion.Arista has a reasonable float of 74 million shares, much smaller than the 4.77 billion share float of its arch rival Cisco Systems (CSCO). Cisco is having a super 2018 so far, up 18% year to date and rising more than 32% since clearing a shallow saucer with handle at 34.20 on Oct. 20.A saucer with handle has some of the aspects of a great cup with handle, but generally shows a more shallow look, even if the decline from high to low exceeds 30%. Plus, the large amount of time that it takes to form this winning stock chart pattern tends to wear investors out rather than shake them out.The Nasdaq composite eased 0.8%, giving back a chunk of its 2.9% advance over the prior two sessions. The tech-centered index was down as much as 1% earlier in the session. The Nasdaq 100 fell 0.9% as it experiences resistance near 7000 for the second time in nearly five weeks.The S&P 500 fell 0.8% while the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 0.7%. Strength in some industrial, tech and commodity-type components within the 30-stock Dow industrials helped blunt the decline.Homebuilders fell hard as the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond jumped back above the 2.90% level and bond prices halted a three-session win streak. Toll Bros. (TOL) swung from a nice early gain to fall nearly 5% to 45.45 in heavy trade. Watch to see if the luxury homebuilder can form a new base. Revenue rose 28% in the January-ended fiscal first quarter to $1.18 billion, notching the biggest year-over-year increase in five quarters as adjusted earnings jumped 52%.Elsewhere in the stock market today, utilities continued to serve as the caboose as the Dow utility average fell another 1.3%. At 675, the 15-stock index remains more than 13% off its November 2017 peak of 778.Among those 15 stocks, NextEra Energy (NEE) has been hanging relatively tough. The Juno Beach, Fla.-based utility dropped 1.7% to 152.07 and slid back below its 50-day moving average. However, as seen in a daily chart on MarketSmith, the stock found nice institutional buying support at the slower-moving, long-term 200-day moving average earlier this month.Watch to see if NextEra can keep its head above the 200-day line, which would be bullish.The large-cap firm has an annualized dividend yield of 2.9%, vs. less than 1.8% for the S&P 500.

122,PFE,"Never count out Mylan (MYL), an analyst said Wednesday, after the Food and Drug Administration approved its generic versions of Teva Pharmaceutical's (TEVA) Copaxone, a multiple sclerosis drug — setting shares of the two companies on vastly divergent paths.XBy the close of trading on the stock market today, Mylan had spiked 16.2% to 37.80. Teva, meanwhile, plunged 14.6% to 16.08. Analysts largely hadn't expected the FDA to approve generic Copaxone until 2018.The approvals were for a 20-milligram daily dose and for 40-milligram shots three times per week. The 40-milligram approval is the first generic at that dose. Novartis' (NVS) Sandoz and Momenta Pharmaceuticals (MNTA) got approval for a 20-milligram daily Copaxone generic, Glatopa, in 2015.Mylan also announced a patient support service dubbed Mylan MS Advocate to help ease patients off branded Copaxone and to its generics with an interactive mobile app, in-home injection training, a 24/7 call center, copay assistance for eligible patients and support from a nurse experienced at treating MS.Analysts were widely surprised at the approvals, which came on the heels of fresh comments from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb to Bloomberg regarding the need to speed generic drug approvals to spur competition and reduce drug prices.""Bottom line, this is incrementally positive for Mylan while for Teva both a negative surprise and a cash flow hit to 2018,"" RBC analyst Randall Stanicky wrote in a note to clients. He reiterated his underperform rating on Teva stock.Teva called the impending launch by Mylan ""at-risk,"" meaning the rival generic drugmaker could be subject to damages and other remedies pending the outcomes of appeals decisions and other patent litigation.In one case, Teva is arguing against a December 2016 decision by the Patent Trial Appeal Board that found all claims from three Copaxone patents were invalid. Teva also is arguing against a January decision in district court that invalidated the claims of four patents covering Copaxone.The firm also is suing five companies, including Mylan, claiming they infringed on a patent covering the manufacturing process for Copaxone. All five companies are working to bring generic copies of the MS drug to the market.IBD'S TAKE: Teva has a poor IBD Composite Rating of 7 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it performs in the bottom 7% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. See better-rated drug stocks via IBD Stock Checkup.Teva expects Mylan's generic launch to eat 25 cents earnings per share in the fourth quarter ending Dec. 31. RBC's Stanicky noted Teva had previously predicted one or two generics could lead to $1 billion to $1.3 billion in annual revenue downside and a $1 hit to per-share earnings.""Teva previously guided to slow Copaxone deterioration due to the stickiness of its patient support program which could play out initially,"" he wrote. However, Mylan's patient support program ""should drive more switching over time.""Consensus numbers project 9% erosion to Teva's Copaxone in the fourth quarter and a decline of 39% in 2018, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat wrote in a note to clients. He expects Teva to ""have to dig deeper for additional cost cuts to offset some of this.""BTIG analyst Timothy Chiang models Mylan bringing in $425 million to $450 million in generic Copaxone sales in the first 12 months following its launch, assuming generic pricing is a 35%-40% discount to the branded drug and Mylan can grab 25%-30% of market share.""We believe the company gaining approval on both strengths of Copaxone not only validates Mylan's core competency as a premier generics company, it also provides an important signal to investors that one can simply never count out Mylan — especially in the area of complex generic products,"" he said.Chiang kept his buy rating on Mylan stock and boosted his price target to 45 from 42.Mylan, in a news release, said it and other first filers could be eligible for 180 days of generic drug exclusivity, but noted that the FDA hadn't yet made a formal determination on that. In the 12 months ended July 31, both strengths of Copaxone brought in $4.34 billion in sales, the firm said.The approvals could be a negative for other entrants, like Momenta and Novartis' Sandoz which are working on getting approval for a 40-milligram version of Copaxone. In February, the duo got a warning letter from the FDA which detailed issues at manufacturer Pfizer's (PFE) fill-finish plant.Momenta stock plunged 13.7% to 15.10 in response to Mylan's approvals.Payers are likely to also put pressure on Biogen (BIIB) to lower the prices of its MS drugs, RBC analyst Brian Abrahams wrote in a research report. In 2016, the six-drug suite brought in just shy of $9 billion in sales.""We believe this highlights the need for Biogen to concede price or share as multiple new generics and branded therapies enter the market in the coming years (especially in a space that does not have high intrinsic growth),"" he wrote.Abrahams estimates Biogen reporting $9 billion in MS drug sales in 2017, but declining 17% by 2025 to $7.6 billion. He noted ""these declines could be higher if payers get more aggressive."" Biogen stock dipped 0.8% to 314.92 in response.RELATED:Generic Drug Makers Face Pricing Issues That Other Pharmas Don'tBiotechs Find Strength In Numbers In Treating Multiple SclerosisHow Roche's 'Game Changer' Drug Will Chip Away At Biogen, Novartis

123,PFE,"Stocks took home some hard-earned gains Tuesday in a session that drove the S&P 500 to a new high and saw two Dow names score breakouts.XThe Dow Jones industrial average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite all marked off 0.3% gains as the Nasdaq gathered into a late rally despite the drag of a negative reversal by Apple (AAPL). Small caps ran ahead of the general market, with the Russell 2000 clocking a 0.6% gain at the close.Global markets had an effect on early trade Tuesday as investors in France and Germany picked up on a second straight powerful rally in Japan. Gains in the U.S. were more muted, with preliminary data showing trade mixed — higher on the NYSE, lower on the Nasdaq.The market was clearly not in a defensive mode on Tuesday, with utilities groups taking three of the five worst losses among the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD, and the largest advances going to oil drillers, home furnishings retailers and automated materials handling equipment makers. But most of the gains driving those groups came either from thinly traded stocks or stocks with beaten down charts needing weeks of mending before they could offer a valid buy point.Once exception, in the home furnishings group, was RH (RH). The high-end online and storefront shop finds itself suddenly back above support at its 10-week moving average and shaping a possible handle on a steep, seven-week cup base.Apple was the day's focal point, introducing its new iPhone X, Apple Watch Series 3 and other revised devices while also inaugurating the company's new space-age Cupertino, Calif.-campus. The stock nevertheless erased early gains to end down 0.7% in very heavy trade, and still unable to break free of its buy range above a 156.75 buy point.FANG stocks ended the session three up, two down, with  IBD SwingTrader play Netflix (NFLX) ending 1.7% higher as it continues climbing toward a 191.60 buy point in an eight-week cup base.On the Dow, Pfizer (PFE) kicked up 3% to lead the index after announcing positive results in a follow-up trial of its Xalkori lung cancer treatment. The stock is forming a base with a 37.49 buy point. It is also possible to interpret the chart as a flat base within the larger pattern with a 34.58 buy point, which Pfizer topped.

124,PFE,"Another Dow breakout came from newly merged chemical giant DowDuPont (DWDP). The stock surged 2.3% after management announced it would tweak plans to divide into three separate companies just enough to please a contingent of activist investors, including Trian Fund Management and Glenview Capital Management. The gain moved shares past a handle buy point of 67.40 in powerful trade, leaving the stock still in a buy range.Leading stocks were divided during the session, with Coherent (COHR) and LGI Homes (LGIH) rising more than 3% apiece to lead the IBD 50 list. Both stocks are building the right side of bases. IBD 50 peers National Beverage (FIZZ) and Coresite Realty (COR) fell about 3.5% each, however, and RealPage (RP) dived nearly 5% in heavy trade, stopping at a test of support at its 10-week moving average.RELATED:Follow The Market: Stock Market TodayUnderstand The Market: The Big PictureDon't Miss These 5 Top Stocks Near Buy Points: Investing Action PlanHere's Why McDonald's Is Reversing A Day After Breaking Out

125,PFE,"Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) popped to a 13-month high Thursday after its immuno-oncology combination proved successful vs. chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with advanced kidney cancer.XIn morning trading on the stock market today, Bristol surged 5% to close at 62.84. Drug stocks hit a 13-month high with AstraZeneca (AZN) among the winners, up 5.1% to close at 31.89. AstraZeneca also is working on immuno-oncology combos.Unlike AstraZeneca's lung-cancer failure in July, Bristol's combination met its key goals in a Phase 3 study. The trial evaluated drugs named Opdivo and Yervoy in patients with advanced kidney cancer who had never been treated vs. chemotherapy.Opdivo plus Yervoy demonstrated superior overall survival vs. chemotherapy in patients with intermediate and poor risk, about 75% of patients, Bristol said in a news release. The combo also outperformed chemo in a random pool of all patients, Bristol said.An independent data-monitoring committee recommended the trial be stopped early on its strong results. More detailed results will be presented Sunday during the European Society for Medical Oncology 2017 Congress, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said.IBD'S TAKE: Bristol grabbed a boost to its Relative Strength Rating on Wednesday to 73 from 63, though on Thursday its RS Rating was at 70 out of a best-possible 99. Head to IBD Data Stories for a closer look at what goes into that ranking.The closest rival trial from Roche (RHHBY) is set to finish up in 2020, Raffat said in a note. Dow component Merck (MRK) also has several trials in kidney cancer testing combinations using its drug Keytruda. Pfizer (PFE) and EMD Sereno are also working on a combo.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez says it's very likely Bristol will get approval for the two drugs in advanced kidney cancer. He has an outperform rating on Bristol stock.""A win on (overall survival) is critically important to our bull thesis for the stock and is consistent with the views of previously interviewed MEDACorp (key opinion leaders),"" he said in a report to clients.RELATED:Bristol Dives But 'Still Has A Chance' In Kidney Cancer: AnalystBristol-Myers Squibb Topples On Kidney Cancer Trial's Mixed ResultsWhy Dow's Merck Is Credit Suisse's Top Pharma Pick

126,PFE,"Ascendis Pharma (ASND) grabbed bullish views and rocketed to a record high Friday after rival Versartis (VSAR) crashed upon reporting its pediatric growth hormone deficiency drug failed in a late-stage trial.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Ascendis had gapped up 23.4% to finish at 34.24 after earlier touching an all-time high, up 51%, at 42. Shares broke out of a consolidation and a 31.96 buy point in heavy volume. Versartis, though, plummeted 87.6% to close at 2.68.Late Thursday, Versartis said its drug somavaratan failed to meet its goal in a Phase 3 study of pediatric patients with growth hormone deficiencies. Now, analysts expect Ascendis to grab the lion's share of the market if its Phase 3 drug wins approval.Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young boosted her price target on Ascendis to 50 from 30. She sees Ascendis getting 30%-50% of the global market, up from her earlier view for a 20%-30% share.She models Ascendis' drug, dubbed TransCon growth hormone, hitting $1.2 billion in peak sales, up from her previous forecast for $820 million. The daily growth hormone market is worth $3.2 billion and could rise to $4.5 billion as the market moves to long-acting drugs.IBD'S TAKE: Among big biotech players, Vertex Pharmaceuticals says it's closing in on the end of its cystic fibrosis journey. So what's next for this top-performer? Head to The New America for an exclusive interview with Chief Executive Jeffrey Leiden.Enrollment in a Phase 3 trial of TransCon growth hormone is expected to be complete in the fourth quarter. Young expects Ascendis to offer data from the trial in late 2018. If the drug is 100% successful, her price target could lift as high as 66.Young sees an 80% chance of Ascendis getting approval for the drug.But Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz kept his market perform rating on Ascendis while awaiting Phase 3 data and noted the risks associated with commercialization. He upped his price target to 37 from 28.Ascendis expects to get 40%-50% market share in the growth hormone deficiency market. Schwartz assumes peak penetrations of 51% and 46% in the U.S. and Europe in 2028-29 for Ascendis' drug, up from his earlier forecast for 40% and 36%, respectively.Still, ""We view 50% market share as an aggressive hurdle that may factor in other bullish assumptions including commercial execution and no other companies succeeding in the clinic with a long-acting growth hormone,"" he said.The firm has a high bar for its Phase 3 data and is going up against the likes of Pfizer (PFE) and Novo Nordisk (NVO). Most specialists say the U.S. market generally favors an aggressive approach to achieve better growth.In a Phase 2 study, annualized growth for pediatric patients treated with TransCon growth hormone was 11.9-13.9 centimeters on two different weekly doses, which was comparable to the 11.6 centimeters for patients treated daily with Pfizer's Genotropin.""That said, there is risk that the result regresses in Phase 3, and it is difficult to pinpoint the market-share implications of such differences in (growth) outcomes,"" Schwartz said.RELATED:Human Growth Drug Flop Sends This Biotech Crashing 83%Alnylam Is Entering 'New Chapter,' But Ionis Still Has A ChanceWhy September Will Be A 'Make Or Break' Month For These Biotechs

Software provider Adobe Systems (ADBE) gapped down 4% despite beating the Street's consensus view on earnings by about 9%. The company's forecast for the fourth quarter failed to impress the Street. The stock was trying to find support at the 50-day moving average.The Fed will conclude its meeting at 2 p.m. ET. Fed Chair Janet Yellen will conduct a news conference at 2:30 p.m. ET. CME Group's FedWatch Tool puts the odds of no change on interest rates at 98.6%, an overwhelming consensus that has been the case for some time. The odds for a rate decrease dropped from 1.4% to zero, and the odds for an increase rose from zero to 1.4%.Rates are at 1% to 1.25%, a range that was set with the June increase in the fed funds rate.Bank stocks, which are sensitive to interest rate changes, have been rising recently. For example, the money center industry group rose in six of the past eight days and was headed toward a gain Wednesday. During the period, including Wednesday so far, the group advanced 5%.Another factor is the Fed's expected plans to begin trimming its $4.5 trillion balance sheet from quantitative easing. This could dent bond prices and lift yields.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, the best performers Wednesday included the oil-drilling group, airlines and specialty steel.

130,PFE,"Investors drove stocks to a positive finish on Friday, with the Dow Jones industrials and S&P 500 seizing new high ground, and the Nasdaq Composite closing just a fraction below record territory.XThe Nasdaq and the Dow Jones industrial average each rose 0.3%. The S&P 500 grabbed a 0.2% gain and small caps outpaced slightly the overall action, leaving the Russell 2000 ahead 0.4%. Preliminary data showed volume rose sharply on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE exchanges.A subway terror attack in London and a North Korean missile fired over Japan stirred uncertainty early in the session, but proved unable to phase market optimism in the final week before the Federal Open Market Committee's highly anticipated meeting starting Tuesday. Economic news was also a potential stumbling block to trade on Friday, with disappointing retail sales and industrial production numbers for August and a sharp slowdown in New York region manufacturing for September. One bright spot was consumer sentiment, which the University of Michigan reported weakened less than expected in its preliminary estimate for September.But the leading indexes nonetheless powered to their third gain in four weeks, leaving the Nasdaq up 1.4%, the S&P 500 with a 1.5% gain and the Dow Jones industrial average with a 2.1% head-and-shoulders above-the-group gain that as its strongest advance since the week ended Dec. 9.Boeing (BA) easily outstrode the Dow, rising 1.5% and breaking out above a flat base buy point at 246.59. That left the stock well within the 5% buy range, which extends to 258.91.Dow peers Verizon (VZ), Apple (AAPL) and Intel (INTC) also logged gains of more than 1%. Dow-listed Pfizer (PFE) backed off 1.1%, but held above the 34.58 flat base buy point it had cleared in fast trade on Tuesday.FANG stocks posted a comparatively mild session, with Facebook (FB) rising 0.4%, but Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOGL) all losing ground.NividiaNVDA buzzed up more than 6% in heavy volume after Evercore ISI boosted its price target on the stock to 250, from 180, and maintained its outperform rating.

The stock remained in buy range, narrowly above the 50.31 entry.On the injured list, Oracle (ORCL) collapsed nearly 8% Friday, after its fiscal first quarter late-Thursday raised questions about the sustainability of the growth in nascent cloud computing business. The sell off breached the stock's 10-week moving average in weighty trade, sending a sell signal, but stopped short of the 7% to 8% loss below its 51.95 buy point, which would have triggered the automatic sell rule.RELATED:Fed, Adobe, FedEx, Defense Giants Lead Investing Action PlanFollow The Market: Stock Market TodayUnderstand The Market: The Big PictureCan You Make Big Stock Profits With Small Cash?

131,PFE,"Theravance Biopharma (TBPH) and Exelixis (EXEL) tick off most of the acquisition boxes for Big Pharma in an overview of the biotech merger picture, an analyst said Friday.X""Acquisition of biotech companies by pharma is an important theme for the space,"" Needham analyst Alan Carr said in a note to clients. ""We believe late development-stage and commercial-stage biotech companies are particularly attractive acquisition targets, in part due to reduced risk.""Of the companies Carr covers, Theravance could attract big pharmas like Amgen (AMGN), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA). In total, Carr counts 21 companies that could be interested in buying Theravance based on research areas, business development interest and past acquisitions.Theravance has one approved drug, an antibiotic for hard-to-treat infections. Beyond that, Exelixis, Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO), Bavarian Nordic, Biohaven Pharmaceutical (BHVN) and Progenics Pharmaceuticals (PGNX) may be attracting the interest of 18 pharmaceuticals apiece.AbbVie, AstraZeneca (AZN), Novartis (NVS), Roche (RHHBY) and Dow stocks Pfizer (PFE) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) could be the most acquisitive, based on Carr's criteria. Each has at least 20 potential targets.But some biotechs may stand a better chance of being acquired vs. others, Carr said. Since January 2014, there have been 37 acquisitions of public biotech companies involving a payment of more than $250 million upfront.More than half already had an approved drug and 78% had at least some Phase 3 data, Carr wrote. Oncology was a key target for U.S. and Japanese pharmas, while rare-disease plays are likely to be acquired at later stages.IBD'S TAKE: Last month, one of these potential acquisition targets jumped to an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 92 out of a best-possible 99. Today, it still has a rating of 90. Head to IBD Data Stories for a closer look at the stock and its catalysts.Rare diseases tend to be of interest to mid-specialty pharmas and biotechs, as traditional drugmakers are likely to avoid the drug-pricing controversy. Since January 2014, the only rare-disease firm snatched up was Actelion Pharmaceuticals by J&J.U.S. and European pharma acquired more later-stage biotechs vs. the less risk-adverse Japanese pharmas and Allergan (AGN). Big areas of interest included central nervous system, rare diseases and oncology which accounted for 22%, 19% and 16% of acquisitions, respectively.Since January 2011, there have been 235 new chemical entry approvals by the Food and Drug Administration. Of the 65 small-to-midsize biotechs which gained this type of approval, 20 (31%) have been acquired. All of them already had a drug on the market at the time of the acquisition.""Many oncology companies, but few rare disease companies were acquired,"" he said.Gilead Sciences' (GILD) acquisition of Kite Pharma (KITE) could break that approval rule. Gilead announced its plan to spend $11.9 billion to buy Kite months ahead of the expected approval date of its first drug in a blood cancer. Novartis' rival treatment was approved days later.RELATED:This Small Biotech Launched To A 9-Month High Today — Here's WhyExelixis Recovers From Bristol-Inspired Pitfall In Kidney CancerBristol Dives But 'Still Has A Chance' In Kidney Cancer: Analyst

135,PFE,"Biotechs, led by Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), outperformed their pharmaceutical brethren in the June quarter, an analyst says as earnings season nears a close.XLeerink analyst Geoffrey Porges  estimates that, of the large-cap biotechs, sales topped Wall Street expectations by an average 5% — with the most impressive beats coming from Alexion, Gilead, Vertex and Biogen (BIIB).Alexion's $912 million in sales topped the consensus by 8%. Gilead's hepatitis C unit fell again in the quarter, but total revenue of $7.14 billion topped by 13%. Vertex reported $544.14 million in sales, beating by 12%. Biogen topped by 10% with $3.1 billion in sales.""By comparison pharma company results were more tepid with Eli Lilly (LLY) and Merck (MRK) delivering significant revenue surprises, but otherwise fairly tepid results consisting of modest beat, in-line results and modest misses,"" Porges said in a note to clients last week.Dow-component Merck and Lilly topped the consensus by 4% and 2%, respectively. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Roche (RHHBY) delivered modest beats; Novartis (NVS), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) were in line. Sanofi (SNY), Pfizer (PFE) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) missed.On the earnings side, ""performance was even more robust in biotech,"" Porges said. Large-cap biotechs beat by an average 9.8%, relative to the consensus. Bigger pharmas delivered earnings that topped the consensus by an average 4.8%.Revenue growth vs. the year-earlier quarter was 10.5% for biotechs and 2.4% for drug firms, on average, Porges said. Across the board, companies reported improved patient-access to drugs, as well as positive demand, inventory and currency effects.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech fever looked chilly in late July. Can the sector overcome the challenges outlined in this IBD Industry Themes report?

136,PFE,"In the quarter, rare-disease players on the biotech side did particularly well, Brad Loncar, chief executive of Loncar Investments, told Investor's Business Daily. Biogen, Vertex and Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) all positively surprised the market.Spinraza, a treatment for spinal muscular atrophy from Biogen and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS), nearly tripled consensus models. The drug brought in $203 million, obliterating views for $70 million, an analyst said.Sarepta absolutely crushed analyst expectations and rose to an eight-month high in July. Its key drug, Exondys 51, treats Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and brought in $13 million more than analysts had expected. Sarepta also cut loss-expectations by half.""I think that's one category of drugs where investors have been expecting payer pushback,"" Loncar said. ""And so far that hasn't shown up. If there was ever a group of companies that was going to boom more, it's rare-disease companies.""But sentiment has soured since the biotech sector hit an 18-month high in late July. Loncar cited political uncertainty, noting that the lion's share of biotechs and drugmakers with revenue-earning products beat expectations and raised guidance.""The fact they're not trading up (indicates that) investors have already reset their expectations for the year, so maybe it just hasn't been quite as impressive in that context,"" he said. ""We had a big run coming into earnings season, and that played a factor as well.""Uncertainty over tax reform is keeping most major players from looking to make big deals, Porges said. The Trump administration has yet to offer further details on its plan to cut the corporate tax rate to 15%, which would make corporate inversions less desirable.Though Gilead has been under the gun to buy something in the wake of slowing hepatitis C sales, it didn't comment on M&A on its second-quarter call. Dow's Pfizer says it's putting deals on pause while awaiting more on the tax situation out of Washington.Loncar noted Pfizer's call was the one that really ""crystalized"" this theme for the broader medtech sector. He had previously said a big deal in biotech could really send the stocks higher. But that looks unlikely in the near term.""Mega-deals might be on pause until that happens, or if that happens,"" he said. ""That's pretty disappointing. It shouldn't really affect what we call bolt-on deals. For the mega-deals, that seems to be holding things up.""RELATED:Gilead's Hepatitis C Franchise Topples Again, But Shares Are Up On BeatWill Pfizer's Cancer Drugs Help It Grow Without A Merger?This Biotech Just Blew Past Its Buy Point On A $13 Million Sales BeatAstraZeneca Beat, But Stock Dives On Drug Failure; 4 More ReportVertex Sings Late Despite Crushing Sales, Profit Expectations

137,PFE,"Two large-cap funds are among those setting up for potential breakouts as the stock market remains near all-time highs.XFirst up is iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA (USMV), which is just shy of a 50.13 flat-base buy point. It briefly cleared a prior flat-base entry in late April, pulled back below the buy point, and bounced off its 50-day moving average en route to a 4% gain.The $13.5 billion fund tracks the MSCI USA Minimum Volatility Index, which comprises domestic stocks that tend to be less volatile than the broader U.S. equity market. It carries a 0.15% expense ratio.USMV's biggest sector weighting was health care as of July 31, at just over 19% of assets. Information technology followed at nearly 19%, consumer staples 13% and financials 11%. Health care names accounted for half the top 10: Becton Dickinson (BDX), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Stryker (SYK), UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG).The fund's top 10 names made up less than 15% of total assets. USMV also helps limit volatility by keeping each holding to about 1.5% or less and has a relatively low annual turnover of 28%.Its year-to-date gain of 11.5% through July 31 is in line with the S&P 500, according to Morningstar Inc. The ETF outpaced the benchmark index over the past three years at 13.1% vs. 10.9%, and slightly underperformed the past five years at 13.5% vs. 14.8%. It has a dividend yield of 2.05%.FlexShares Quality Dividend Index Fund (QDF), which tracks the Northern Trust Quality Dividend Index, is near a 41.85 buy point of a flat base.The fund, which launched in December 2012, targets stocks with a sustainable yield. That leads to profitable companies that should have the ability to keep paying dividends. Top holdings as of July 28 included Procter & Gamble (PG), Boeing (BA), Pfizer (PFE), Apple (AAPL) and Merck (MRK).Its top 10 stocks accounted for about 27% of assets; annual turnover is 85%. QDF has lagged the S&P 500 this year and over the past three years. That's despite an annualized yield of 3%, which is well above the benchmark index's 1.91% average yield. Its expense ratio is 0.37%.Tuesday was a good day for many foreign ETFs, including WisdomTree International Equity Fund (DWM) and iShares MSCI Hong Kong (EWH). DWM is still in buy range from a 53.51 entry and EWH from a 24.32 flat-base buy point.The stock market pared early gains Wednesday, leaving only the Dow Jones industrial average in positive territory.Despite a 5% earnings-fueled jump by Apple (AAPL), SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) held only a 0.15% gain. SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) slipped 0.2% and PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) edged 0.1% lower.Stocks sold off across the board with telecom, retail and real estate leading the decline. SPDR S&P Telecom (XTL) fell 1.5%, slipping below its 50-day line for the first time in two weeks.But VanEck Vectors Oil Services (OIH) reversed to a 0.1% advance.

144,PFE,"Exelixis (EXEL) is on a hot streak.The South San Francisco-based biotech has notched a series of achievements in recent months — posting first-time operating profit, confirming the effectiveness of its breakout compound for treating kidney cancer and retiring nearly all its debt.All that, coupled with improving fundamentals and short-term market-share growth potential have propelled Exelixis' near-complete transformation from development-stage company to commercially viable drugmaker. Plus, it has plans to keep growing via partnerships with the likes of Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Roche Holding (RHHBY).Exelixis Chief Executive Michael M. Morrissey said in an email interview with Investor's Business Daily that the real game-changer for the company came with the Food and Drug Administration's April 2016 approval of Cabometyx, the second drug that Exelixis is selling using its compound known as cabozantinib. Made in tablet form, it's the first and only single-agent therapy for patients who have already undergone treatment for advanced renal cell carcinoma to demonstrate clinically meaningful improvements in three parameters measuring survival rates and responses to the medication.""It put us on a path where we're now able to grow the organization from the cash we generate from our operations, and to execute on our plans to create a new generation of Exelixis medicines,"" Morrissey said. ""Beyond those initial collaborations, we really want cabozantinib to become the backbone of choice for immunotherapy combinations, so we are interested in evaluating it alongside as many promising (immuno-oncology) agents as possible, providing there's a clear clinical rationale for doing so.""""You'd be hard pressed to find someone in our organization who hasn't had an up-close-and-personal experience with this disease, either in their own life or of that of a loved one or friend,"" Morrissey said. ""This commitment to patients — and the drive to do everything we can to bring new therapies forward, and make sure they're accessible — informs everything we do in the clinic, in the field and in the office.""Echoing investors' nod of approval with increasing stock value, eight analysts hold a consensus rating of outperform, according to a June 27 report by Research Driven Investing. Exelixis shares now are flirting with buy territory at highs not seen in nearly 17 years, having topped a 24.95 buy point out of a cup base several times in recent trading sessions.Cowen & Co. analyst Eric Schmidt said via email that Exelixis shares were one of 2016's best performers in biotech and are continuing to outdo the sector this year. Its shares are up roughly 65% year to date, while the overall sector is up about 19%.""The successful launch of (cabozantinib) in (renal cell carcinoma) is responsible for the stock's performance and all of (Exelixis') growth,"" said Schmidt, who maintains an outperform rating on Exelixis based on its near-to-long-term growth potential, thanks to the company's clinical initiatives, partnerships and balance sheets.Another upside, Schmidt said, is that unlike some of its pharmaceutical and biotech competitors, Exelixis is largely immune to concerns on lower drug prices or speculative effects of proposed health care legislation.""Trump and governmental issues are not a concern for their business; cancer drug pricing is quite secure,"" Schmidt said.Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. analyst Leah Cann gives the stock a perform rating on her expectation of the company's ability to grow unit sales of its three products.""We estimate that Exelixis' total revenue will grow at a (compound annual growth rate) of 46.2% for the next five years, increasing to $1.28 billion in 2012,"" Cann said.Founded in 1994 and publicly-traded since 2000, Exelixis first started using cabozantinib in a medication known as Cometriq, which is a capsule used to treat thyroid cancer but has found a limited market compared with Cabometyx. Exelixis' third product, Cotellic, is a formulation of another compound known as cobimetinib and marketed under a collaboration with Genentech.Exelixis' revenue was up 424% during the first quarter ended March 31. Sales jumped to $80.89 million, up from $15.43 million in the year-ago period.After turning a profit for the first time in 2016's fourth quarter, the company continued in the black with first-quarter net income of $16.7 million, or 5 cents a share, reversing the year-ago loss of $59.2 million, or 26 cents a share.IBD'S TAKE: On June 26, Exelixis went above its 24.95 breakout but fell the next day. It has flirted with that level several times but has yet to stay above it consistently. The stock is ranked eighth in IBD's Medical Biomed/Biotech group, with Celgene in the No. 1 spot.Exelixis further flouted its balance sheet fundamentals by announcing repayment of $123.8 million on Deerfield Notes — one year ahead of schedule — at a savings of approximately $12 million in interest expense. Over the past year, Exelixis retired a total of $490 million in debt.Morrissey said the company will use the free cash to invest in additional clinical trials of its product pipeline, resume internal discovery efforts and pursue in-licensing opportunities.""Like many biotech companies, Exelixis has had debt on its books for much of its history — the importance of financial flexibility can't be understated,"" Morrissey said. ""It will allow us to further our No. 1 goal of delivering new treatment options to patients in need.""Also fueling the stock's run is the company's June 19 announcement that an independent panel found a trial for cabozantinib significantly improved progression-free survival compared with Pfizer's (PFE) Sutent when used in patients with previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma.""Given the scarcity of active, differentiated assets in the biopharmaceutical industry, we see the cabozantinib franchise as extremely valuable,"" said William Blair analyst Andy T. Hsieh in a June 26 research report.Hsieh noted that Cabometyx's launch into the second-line renal market will contribute significantly to revenue and shareholder returns.""Ongoing clinical and regulatory initiatives could materially increase the total addressable market for cabozantinib,"" he said.Exelixis remains on track to complete a supplemental New Drug Application for cabozantinib as a first-line advanced renal cancer treatment in its 2017 third quarter.While the company would not comment on a possible sale, analysts said Exelixis might be ultimately courted by a larger company.Said Cowen's Schmidt, ""Nothing has been publicly disclosed, but no one would be shocked if (Exelixis) were to be an acquisition target.""

146,PFE,"XMajor stock indexes showed modest gains in afternoon trading Thursday as Wall Street digested strong earnings from Oracle (ORCL). Health care stocks outperformed after the GOP released a new version of the ObamaCare repeal bill.In the stock market today, Oracle (ORCL) gapped up over a 47.09 flat-base entry, rising around 9%. Strong earnings were the catalyst. It's OK to buy a stock when it gaps up over a buy point, but it's important to buy as close to the open price as possible. Oracle opened at 51.61. Shares were recently trading around 50.57.The Nasdaq composite led the way, up 0.4%; the S&P 500 rallied 0.2% and the Dow Jones industrial average picked up 0.1%. Small caps outperformed, with the Russell 2000 up 0.5%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking slightly lower than Wednesday's levels.Health care-related industry groups outperformed while a few retail groups lagged. Outperformers in the Dow included UnitedHealth (UNH), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK).Meanwhile, China stocks were pressured after Chinese regulators asked Weibo (WB) to stop audio and video streaming services.

147,PFE,"The sell-off Wednesday on Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) was overdone, analysts said after Bristol failed to meet a key benchmark in a kidney cancer trial — prompting rival Exelixis (EXEL) to pop nearly 7%.XBristol ""still has a chance"" in treating advanced kidney cancer patients with a combination of immuno-oncology drugs Opdivo and Yervoy, UBS analyst Marc Goodman said in a note to clients following Bristol's late Tuesday announcement.Opdivo and Yervoy were compared with a chemotherapy known as sunitinib in previously untreated advanced kidney cancer patients. The combo improved progression-free survival to 11.56 months at the median, but that wasn't statistically significant vs. 8.38 months for chemo.But 41.6% of patients on the combo experienced tumor shrinkage vs. 26.5% of patients on chemo. The trial will continue into the second half of 2019, when Bristol is expected to have data on overall survival.""With that said, if Bristol fails to secure a filing in (first treatment of) renal cell carcinoma with the current data, Bristol could be one year behind Roche (RHHBY) and Pfizer (PFE), assuming they have positive data,"" Goodman said.IBD'S TAKE: Bristol has an IBD Composite Rating of 74 out of best-possible 99. It lags Novo Nordisk which leads specialty drug stocks with a CR of 88. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at other top-rated drug stocks.Bristol is expected to discuss all the results with the Food and Drug Administration. With the narrow miss on progression-free survival, the FDA might not require overall survival data for approval, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez wrote in a note to clients.""The (progression-free survival) data showed a notable trend in favor of the combo, and it appears the data would have achieved statistical significance had this been the sole primary endpoint,"" he said.Roche is working on a Phase 3 trial of its immuno-oncology drug Tecentriq and cancer drug Avastin in advanced kidney cancer. It's expected to read out in early 2018. Dow component Pfizer has a late-stage trial of its drugs Bavencio and Inlyta in advanced kidney cancer, expected in mid-2018.Bristol's late Tuesday announcement also benefits Exelixis which saw shares pop as much as 6.6% in early trades, though it was up just a fraction midday on the stock market today, near 27. Bristol, meanwhile, slipped 0.6% to close at 57.50. Roche gained a penny to 31.54. Pfizer lost two cents to 33.36.Exelixis' drug, Cabometyx, is approved as a second and third treatment in kidney cancer. Investors had been worried about a number of ongoing combination trials. Of those, the combo from Bristol looked ""most promising,"" Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt said.The news ""raises the regulatory bar for a potential near-term competitor in (first treatment of) renal cell carcinoma,"" he wrote in a note to clients. It could also help push enrollment in a partnered trial in advanced kidney cancer between Bristol and Exelixis.RELATED:Bristol-Myers Squibb Topples On Kidney Cancer Trial's ResultsWhy Dow's Merck Is Credit Suisse's Top Pharma PickWill Pfizer's Cancer Drugs Help It Grow Without A Merger?

148,PFE,"U.S. stock indexes padded their cushions above the 50-day moving averages midday Thursday, as heavy-construction stocks rumbled toward the group's eighth daily gain in a row.The Nasdaq and the small-cap Russell 2000 led with gains of 0.7% and 1%, respectively, at midday. The S&P 500 added 0.4%, while the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average clawed 0.2% higher. Volume in the stock market today was running higher on both major exchanges compared with the same time Wednesday.Price gains accompanied by rising volume are considered more bullish than advances in fading volume.In the heavy-construction space, Granite Construction (GVA) jumped 3% as it built the right side of a consolidation.Granite Construction is expected to grow earnings 9% this year, but analysts expect 98% earnings growth in 2018.The heavy construction group is a market laggard but rose 6% over the past five sessions. The group includes potential players in the post-Harvey storm recovery.Contractor Quanta Services (PWR) tacked on 0.8% as the stock approaches a 37.45 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. The company is expected to grow EPS 34% this year and 20% next year.Meanwhile, the construction mining equipment group rose for a third consecutive day and the group scored a new high. Caterpillar (CAT) notched a 52-week high and then retreated. Cat's relative strength line is at a high, a bullish sign that means the stock is outperforming the S&P 500. Going into Thursday's session, the equipment group was No. 31 among 197 industry groups.The so-called FANG stocks — Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOGL) — were up without exception.

149,PFE,"Puma Biotechnology (PBYI), Portola Pharmaceuticals (PTLA) and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) led a deluge of losses Thursday that saw the sector slide to a seven-week low and IBD's 444-company Biotech industry group slip two spots in rank.XIn midday trading on the stock market today, biotechs overall lost 3.1%, touching a low last seen June 20. The biotech industry group is now ranked sixth out of 197 groups IBD tracks, down from fourth last week.Biotech stocks hit an 18-month high in July, riding a wave ahead of second-quarter earnings. As of Wednesday's close, the sector has fallen 6% from that high as the earnings season comes to a close. On Wednesday, Portola, Puma and Alnylam offered their reports.Alnylam's sales missed expectations and adjusted losses were deeper than expected, prodding shares to drop 7.5%, near 74.50. But Leerink analyst Paul Matteis remained bullish on Alnylam, keeping his market perform rating and 83 price target.He sees an ""ideal"" opportunity for Alnylam in treating acute hepatic porphyria with its drug, givosiran. The disorder involves the buildup of chemicals within the body. Alnylam's drugs belong to a class that use RNA interference to silence specific genes.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech fever looked like it had chilled in late July as long-term views remained cloudy. But that followed a number of biotechs that beat second-quarter expectations and raised guidance. Get the details via IBD Industry Themes.""We think acute hepatic porphyria represents an ideal indication for RNA interference medicine on the basis that it is an underserved orphan disease driven by a single target,"" Matteis wrote in a research report.Alnylam is also aiming to file an application for patisiran before year's end. Patisiran is being developed to treat a rare condition known as hereditary ATTR amyloidosis in which abnormal proteins build up on multiple organs, damaging and impeding them.Puma dove 9.9%, near 71.70, after announcing late Wednesday that European approval of its breast cancer drug, Nerlynx, has been pushed back to at least the first quarter of 2018, from earlier view for the third quarter of 2017.Nerlynx's commercialization is likely to be the biggest driver of shares in the near-term, RBC analyst Matthew Eckler told clients in a note. There's also the potential, ""or lack thereof,"" for partnering of mergers and acquisitions, he said.The firm also reported losses of $2.10 per share, widening from $2.05 per share in the year-earlier quarter. That missed analysts' view for a $2.04 per-share loss. Adjusted losses of $1.38 per share widened by 21 cents. Analyst views were not immediately available.Late Wednesday, Portola said it's working through some manufacturing-process changes that could push its U.S. launch of Bevyxxa to the first quarter of 2018. But the biotech reiterated its plan to launch sometime between September and November, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said.Bevyxxa is a treatment to prevent blood clots in hospitalized patients at risk due to moderate or several mobility restrictions. The drug is Portola's first and only approved in the U.S. Its pipeline includes another anticoagulant, blood cancer drugs and an anti-inflammatory drug.European regulators are expected to issue an opinion on Bevyxxa by late 2017 or early 2018.For the second quarter, Portola reported $3.8 million in collaboration and license revenue, dipping from $4.2 million in the year-earlier period and lagging a $4.3 million model. Losses of $1.22 per share grew by 20 cents and were wider than the consensus view for a 98-cent loss.Revenue stemmed from agreements with Dow components Pfizer (PFE) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) under its Janssen unit, as well as with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Bayer (BAYRY) and Daiichi Sankyo.Portola toppled 8.2%, near 55.40.RELATED:Alnylam Reports Lagging Sales, Wider-Than-Expected LossesPerrigo's Beat-And-Raise Lifts Generic Drugs, Bucks Teva-Mylan TrendCan Generic Drug Stocks Catch A Break After Mylan's Crash?

151,PFE,"Merck's (MRK) Keytruda continued to gain share over immuno-oncology drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Roche (RHHBY) in May after the approval of its Keytruda-plus-chemotherapy combination.Overall immuno-oncology drug sales grew 18% month over month in May to $602 million, data from Symphony Health show. Merck's Keytruda is gaining share at the expense of Bristol's Opdivo and Yervoy, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez says.Keytruda share increased 1 percentage point to 28% as Opdivo and Yervoy shares fell to 49% and 16%, respectively, from a combined 72% at the end of 2016. Roche's drug, Tecentriq, remains steady at a 7% share after one year on the market.Tecentriq differs from Keytruda and Opdivo in that it targets the PD-L1 protein vs. the PD-1 protein targeted by Merck's and Bristol's drugs. Pfizer's (PFE) Bavencio and AstraZeneca's (AZN) Imfinzi are also anti-PD-L1 antibodies.Bavencio and Imfinzi are newest to the market and ""have achieved only a nominal share in their third and first months, respectively, following approval,"" Fernandez wrote in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: In other immuno-oncology news, Kite Pharma (KITE) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE) stocks have rocketed this month following the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago. Head to the Industry Snapshot for a deep dive.Fernandez expects Keytruda to keep gaining share following its approval in advanced lung cancer in combination with Alimta from Eli Lilly (LLY). Keytruda also received recent approvals in bladder cancer and in some tumors.Evercore analyst Umer Raffat says Keytruda is tracking toward analyst projections for $485 million in sales in the second quarter. If June sales are up 14% month over month, Keytruda is likely to beat those expectations, Raffat wrote in a note to clients.On the stock market today, Merck, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, was up 1.4% to close at 65.46, as shares of Bristol rose 0.7% to 56.07.

The S&P 500 dropped 0.7%, while the Dow Jones industrial average drifted down 0.3%. Preliminary data showed volume on both exchanges coming in higher than Monday's levels.West Texas intermediate crude dropped to just above $43 a barrel as oil sloughed off another 2%, undercutting a May low to settle at its lowest point since November. But a move that would've sent oil-related stocks crowding the lowest slots on the Dow and S&P 500 barely even registered.   Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) dropped less than 1%.  Oil stocks posted only five of the day's 20 worst losses among S&P 500 stocks.General Electric (GE) was the Dow's worst performer, down 2% in weak trade.  Apple (AAPL) tumbled 0.8%, and all four of the FANG stocks ended lower, despite a price target increase for Netflix (NFLX).Medicals, drugmakers and biotechs posted a strong session. Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE) easily topped the Dow industrials, up 1.5% and 1.4%, respectively.  IBD 50 stock Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) led both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100. (Biotechs and drugmakers took the day's top seven gains among Nasdaq 100 stocks.)Regeneron surged 5% to reach a 17-month high, despite Novartis (NVS) reporting its RTH258 macular degeneration drug had outperformed Regeneron's Eylea in a head-to-head clinical trial. Regeneron is up 9% since clearing a six-month cup base in May. Novartis shares rose 0.2% Tuesday.Alexion jumped 3% after regulatory filings showed CEO Ludwig Hanson made a purchase of company shares worth $1.1 billion.IBD 50 and Leaderboard stock Floor & Decor (FND) ended 2% higher after backing down from its early highs.

153,PFE,"Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and Tesaro (TSRO) could each deliver blockbuster ovarian cancer drugs and grab takeover interest, an analyst said Friday ahead of a key trial for Clovis, expected later this month.The duo rivals bigger AstraZeneca (AZN), whose $87.3 billion market cap is more than eight times that of Clovis and Tesaro combined. Clovis and Tesaro joined AstraZeneca on the PARP-inhibitor market within the last year.PARP inhibitors work by blocking a family of enzymes that cancer cells use to proliferate. Pfizer (PFE) and AbbVie (ABBV) are also working on PARP inhibitors. Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young sees the class of drugs also having an impact in prostate, breast and lung cancers.""We think that the PARP (inhibitor) market is big enough ($8 billion to $10 billion) that Clovis can have a blockbuster product as well,"" she wrote. ""We strongly believe that both companies are likely attractive targets for large global biopharma companies.""Later this month, Clovis is expected to unveil the results of its Phase 3 trial, dubbed Ariel-3, for its drug Rubraca. Tesaro previously set a high bar with a trial of its drug Zejula which had a benefit in all patients regardless of specific genetics.""On a top-line basis, we think Ariel-3 will work across the groups, but the focus will be on potential commercial differences like use of biomarker and safety,"" she wrote in a note to clients.Young expects Tesaro stock to be volatile following Clovis' trial, but notes that it will lift an overhang on shares. She has outperform ratings on both Tesaro and Clovis stocks. She rates Tesaro stock with a 198 price target and Clovis with an 88 price target, up from 74.On the stock market today, Clovis stock rose 0.45% to 59.97. Tesaro stock gained 0.1% to 144.31. AstraZeneca, Pfizer and AbbVie stocks were up 1.4%, 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively.IBD'S TAKE: The American Society of Clinical Oncology laid out the battlefield fighting cancer. Companies like Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Incyte and Roche are working on combining drugs on the immuno-oncology spectrum. Get more at IBD Industry Themes.Shares of fellow cancer biotech Incyte (INCY) toppled 1.9% to 118.05, after sustaining a price-target cut. Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt trimmed his price target on Incyte stock to 129 from 134 after Incyte and Eli Lilly's (LLY) rheumatoid arthritis treatment was delayed in the U.S.In April, the Food and Drug Administration delayed approval for the drug, called baricitinib, instead asking for more information into a trial. Now, Schmidt says he expects $400 million in 2026 sales, down from $1.3 billion. He sees the drug launching in 2020.But, Schmidt was bullish on Seattle Genetics (SGEN) stock after the small biotech and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) unveiled strong data for a combination of their drugs Adcetris and Opdivo in classical Hodgkin lymphoma. All signs of cancer disappeared in 63% of patients.A series of trials for the combination could ""potentially provide a chemotherapy-free treatment option"" for patients whose Hodgkin lymphoma either relapsed or can't be treated with surgery.Schmidt has outperform ratings on Seattle Genetics and Bristol-Myers stocks.RELATED:Tesaro Crashes Despite Beating AstraZeneca With 'Stronger' DataBristol-Incyte Match Beats Dow's Merck In Combination TrialsConference Spotlights Drug Giant Donnybrooks In Cancer Treatments

154,PFE,"Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) diabetes drug, Invokana, cut down on cardiovascular events during a long-term study — but Eli Lilly (LLY) stands to benefit most as doctors steer clear of the medication on worries it increased the risk of amputation.The study, dubbed Canvas, was presented late Monday. In it, Dow stock Johnson & Johnson said Invokana reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, nonfatal heart attack and nonfatal stroke by 14% vs. a non-drug placebo.Additional analysis showed that Invokana lowered the risk of hospitalization for heart failure by 33%. Invokana also delayed the progression of albuminuria — the presence of a specific chemical in the urine indicating kidney disease.RBC analyst Glenn Novarro says the Canvas study is unlikely to reverse the negative trajectory of Invokana sales. In the first quarter, Invokana and Invokamet sales dropped 17% year over year. For 2017, Novarro forecasts a 6% dip in sales to $1.2 billion.Eli Lilly, on the other hand, will benefit from Johnson & Johnson's study as Merck (MRK) trails, analysts say. Lilly's Jardiance is a SGLT2 inhibitor, which works by helping the kidneys to lower blood glucose levels. Merck's Januvia is a DPP-4, which blocks glucagon release, triggering insulin secretion.""Validated cardiovascular benefits should boost the SGLT2 class,"" Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan wrote. In a similar study, Lilly's Jardiance also showed a 14% benefit on cardiovascular outcomes. Jardiance also cut the risk of cardiovascular death and all mortality.Even without the Canvas study, Lilly was poised to grab a chunk of Invokana's sales after the Food and Drug Administration required Johnson & Johnson to warn physicians of the potential for amputation associated with Invokana. Invokana doubled the risk of amputation in a recent study.Experts cited by Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez say the amputation worry could be the ""biggest differentiating factor"" in physicians' decision to prescribe Jardiance over Invokana, as both show a similar cardiovascular benefit in diabetes patients.At the close on the stock market today, Johnson & Johnson stock ticked up 0.2% to finish the regular trading session at 132.02. Lilly stock added 0.4% to 81.25 and shares of diabetes drugmaker Merck dipped 1% to end the day at 63.27.IBD'S TAKE: Johnson & Johnson stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 77, meaning it outperforms more than three-quarters of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. For more of IBD's ratings visit IBD Stock Checkup.Meanwhile, the DPP-4 class of diabetes drugs, which includes Merck's Januvia, could face incremental pressure, Credit Suisse's Divan said.""Over time, however, we expect the enthusiastic response to the Canvas efficacy data driving use of the SGLT2 class earlier in the course of treatment, while concurrently pushing the DPP-4s further back,"" he said in a note to clients.Merck and Pfizer (PFE), a Dow stock, are jointly working on an SGLT2 inhibitor called ertugliflozin. Regulators could approve the drug in December, but it won't have data on cardiovascular outcomes for several years. Pfizer will take a chunk of those sales, meaning a shift from Januvia to ertugliflozin will be a net negative for Merck.RELATED:Lilly Could Grab Diabetes Share From Dow's J&J On Amputation WoesAbbVie Expects Rivals To Chip Away At Its Biggest Drug FranchiseDow's Pfizer Faces Challenges As Roche, J&J, Lilly Loom

169,PFE,"Spark Therapeutics (ONCE) and Corcept Therapeutics (CORT) defied a downtrend in the biotech sector Wednesday and instead rocketed to fresh highs on strong second-quarter reports.O on the stock market today, Spark topped a two-year high, rising 19.7% to 79%.72. Shares touched a high last seen in April 2015. Corcept popped 8.8% to 13.38, after earlier rising above 14 for the first time since its initial public offering in 2004.But the broader biotech sector for a third straight session. IBD's 441-company Biotech industry group — a recent stock market darling after hitting an 18-month high in July — slipped to sixth out of 197 groups tracked. Last week it was ranked fifth.For its second quarter ended June 30, Spark reported $1.48 million in sales and adjusted losses of $2.40 per share. Revenue grew 15% and topped expectations for $1.06 million. But losses widened from a $1.04 loss per share in the year-earlier period and missed the consensus for a $1.74 loss per share.Spark also reported initial data from three patients with a form of hemophilia, a bleeding disorder caused by a missing or defective clotting protein known as factor VIII. Two participants treated with the drug dubbed SPK-8011 achieved a stable factor VIII average north of 12% with no spontaneous bleeds.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech fever may be cooling as the second-quarter earnings season winds down. For some, long-term views either look weak or uncertain. Head to IBD Industry Themes for the deep dive.Late Tuesday, Corcept reported $35.6 million in sales and adjusted income of 13 cents per share, up a respective 80% and 333% vs. the year-earlier period. Analysts had called for $32.5 million in sales. Adjusted income expectations were not immediately available. Income per share of 10 cents beat analysts' views for 7 cents.Corcept is continuing to enroll a Phase 2 trial for a drug to treat Cushing's syndrome, which results when the body is exposed to high levels of the hormone cortisol for a long time. Symptoms include abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, stretch marks, weak muscles and bones, and acne.It also has two cortisol modulators entering Phase 1 trials in the near future. One will be combined with Xtandi, a drug Pfizer (PFE) acquired when it bought Medivation last year, in a population of patients with prostate cancer.Enrollment is also ongoing in a Phase 1/Phase 2 trial of a drug combined with Celgene's (CELG) Abraxane to treat patients with solid-tumor cancers.RELATED:This Small Biotech Launched To A 9-Month High Today — Here's WhyWhy Sanofi Earnings Spooked Regeneron Shares To A 6-Week LowBiotechs Gained $1.7 Billion Last Week — Can They Keep It Going?

170,PFE,"Generic competition chipped away at Pfizer's (PFE) depression drug Pristiq, contributing to a $172 million revenue miss in the second quarter, an analyst said Tuesday after the Dow component reported earnings.XOn the stock market today, Pfizer sank 0.2% to 33.08. Pfizer is in a consolidation going back exactly one year, with the stock recently retaking its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.For the second quarter, Pfizer reported adjusted income of 67 cents per share on $12.9 billion in sales. Adjusted earnings grew nearly 5% and topped the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research by 2 cents. Sales missed the $13.02 billion view, and fell 2%.Evercore analyst Umer Raffat noted that Pristiq sales lagged the consensus by $50 million after the drug lost market exclusivity in March.""The drop was very rapid,"" he said in a note to clients. This contributed to a 14% year-over-year decline in Pfizer's essential health unit, which houses its legacy drugs.Sales of Prevnar 13, a pneumonia drug, declined 16% in the U.S. and missed analysts' predictions by $127 million, Raffat said. The U.S. decline was due to timing of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention purchases for pediatric patients. International markets grew 4%.But Pfizer's oncology unit appears to be ""stabilizing,"" Raffat said. Worldwide Ibrance sales rocketed 66% vs. the year-earlier quarter to $853 million, obliterating the consensus view for $750 million. Ibrance is used to treat a specific population of patients with advanced breast cancer.IBD'S TAKE: Pfizer has an IBD Composite Rating of 49, meaning it performs in the bottom half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at the drugmakers with the strongest ratings.Sales of Enbrel, an immunosuppressant, struggled in the quarter. Revenue from the drug plunged 20% outside the U.S. and Canada to $617 million, though that beat the consensus for $589 million, Raffat said. Pfizer cited competition from biosimilars in Europe for the decline.Pfizer raised its full-year adjusted income guidance to $2.54-$2.60 per share, up by 2 cents at the midpoint, and reaffirmed its sales guidance for $52 billion to $54 billion.Pfizer is a member of the Dow Jones industrial average.

The same was with the worst-performing bracket, which included medical, energy, technology and other assorted groups that were down more than 1%.Automakers were the top group in today's session, all due to Tesla (TSLA). Shares leaped nearly 7% in heavy volume after the electric car company beat expectations with its quarterly results. Tesla climbed back above the 50-day moving average.A few top-rated stocks came under heavy selling after earnings reports.Molina Healthcare (MOH) gapped down nearly 9% and has erased all gains from a breakout in early May. Molina reported a loss of $4.10 a share, citing losses at its ObamaCare exchange business. Molina will exit the Wisconsin and Utah markets and scale back its presence in Washington state. It plans sharp premium increases in its remaining markets.Sierra Wireless (SWIR) gapped down to a loss of 17.5%.

JPMorgan upgraded the stock today to overweight from neutral.Tableau Software (DATA) rose 8% in more than five times its average volume and topped a 67.19 buy point. The publisher of data-analysis software earned 10 cents a share in the second quarter, above expectations and an improvement over a year-ago loss of 1 cent per share. Royal Bank of Canada raised its target price to 70 from 65.Ubiquiti Networks (UBNT) broke out of a cup-type base with a 64.72 buy point after the maker of wireless-networking gear topped earnings and revenue estimates. It also guided current-quarter earnings higher. The most salient characteristic of the base is its two big gaps, one on the down side, at the start of the pattern, and one with today's breakout. The Relative Price Strength and Accumulation/Distribution ratings are weak for Ubiquiti, but they may improve with today's gap up.RELATED:Aetna Trounces Expectations As Big ObamaCare Insurer CrashesThese 4 Top Stocks Are Soaring Into Buy Zones On EarningsHere's What Analysts Like And Don't Like About Tesla EarningsNetworking Stock Soars Into Buy Zone On Earnings And Guidance

But financials outperformed again after a strong showing Thursday, fueled by news the House passed a bill that seeks to undo Dodd-Frank financial reform passed in 2010.The Dow Jones industrial average edged higher, helped by strength in Chevron (CVX) and Pfizer (PFE). Goldman Sachs (GS)and JPMorgan (JPM) also outperformed, but selling in the Nasdaq weighed on Dow components Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). Both showed losses of nearly 3%.The S&P 500 lost 0.3% while the Nasdaq composite slumped 2%. A distribution day was in the works for the Nasdaq as volume was tracking about 50% higher than Thursday's levels.Nvidia (NVDA) reversed in spectacular fashion, hurt by negative comments from short seller Citron Research. After rising 5% intraday, shares were down 9% in afternoon trading.Nvidia was one of several growth names in the IBD 50 hit hard. Other decliners included Macom (MTSI), down 6%, and Lumentum (LITE), down 5%.Nasdaq 100 chip names Micron (MU), KLA-Tencor (KLAC) and Applied Materials (AMAT) showed losses of around 5%.Financials remained a bright spot. California-based East West Bancorp (EWBC) extended gains, rising 3%. Shares are up nearly 8% so far this week. It's still in buy range from a 57.34 buy point, but it's been a low-volume breakout so far.In the stock market today, Digital Realty Trust (DLR), a real estate investment trust that operates data centers, announced plans to buy smaller competitor DuPont Fabros Technology (DFT) for $7.6 billion.

173,PFE,"XTenet Healthcare (THC) and other hospitals led a broad advance in health care stocks on Thursday as Senate Republicans unveiled their own version of TrumpCare.The short takeaway, courtesy of Mizuho analyst Sheryl Skolnick, is that the Senate bill is ""Lots Less Worse Short-Term; Lots More Worse Long-Term,"" in comparison to the House version. In particular, Medicaid spending would suffer a smaller hit in the near term, but face even bigger long-term cuts.Among hospital groups, HCA Healthcare (HCA) rose 2.5%, Tenet Healthcare jumped 6.8% and Universal Health Services (UHS) gained 1.8%.The stock performance may have even taken management by surprise. Politico published a letter Tenet sent to employees asking them to rally opposition to TrumpCare.Investors have good reason to focus more on the intermediate term, because it's always possible that the big out-year cuts could be interrupted or delayed — if Democrats make a comeback, for example. On the other hand, the sharp eventual spending cuts relative to ObamaCare could threaten the support of moderate GOP senators. NBC News was reporting that three GOP senators planned to voice their opposition to the new legislation, enough to deny passage.Managed care companies also were solidly higher on Thursday. Centene (CNC) and Molina (MOH), both big players in the ObamaCare exchanges and its Medicaid expansion, were among the better performers. Centene climbed 3.6% and Molina 2.3%. Anthem (ANTM), the biggest ObamaCare exchange insurer, rose 0.65%. Anthem said on Wednesday that it's pulling out of the ObamaCare marketplaces in Indiana and Wisconsin.Centene is among the rare companies making a profit from the exchanges, but Medicaid is a big profit driver for the industry, including UnitedHealth Group (UNH), a Dow Jones industrial average component. All insurers would stand to benefit from the GOP plan to kill a tax on health insurance plans.UnitedHealth rose 0.7% to a record high, while Aetna (AET) gained 0.55% and Humana (HUM) advanced 0.3%.Skolnick's message to investors: ""Buy UNH and HCA.""Prospects of more modest health spending cuts than feared — assuming TrumpCare even passes — also lifted shares of drugmakers and biotechs. Among Dow components, Merck (MRK) rose 0.9%, Pfizer (PFE) 0.5% and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) 0.85%, with J&J notching a record high.Johnson & Johnson would also stand to benefit from the repeal of ObamaCare's tax on medical devices. Merck, which has been rallying on good news for immuno-oncology treatment Keytruda, crossed an aggressive entry and neared a conventional buy point.

174,PFE,"XThe stock market closed mixed Thursday after a late wave of selling erased much of the day's work.The Nasdaq, which had been up 0.4%, closed less than 0.1% higher. The S&P 500 wiped out a modest 0.2% gain to close a fraction lower.The Dow Jones industrial average fell less than 0.1%. Medical companies Merck (MRK), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Pfizer (PFE), UnitedHealth (UNH) were four of the five best Dow components.Small caps performed better, with the Russell 2000 climbing 0.4%.The downward reversals certainly were not encouraging, but volume was lower across the board, according to preliminary data. That suggested that institutional investors did not sell in massive quantities. Also, the negative reversals were not severe in scale.Senate Republicans unveiled their own version of legislation to replace ObamaCare, and investors seemed to like what it could mean for the health care sector. Medical software, drug wholesalers, managed care and several other medical-sector industry groups were among the day's best performing, rising 0.7% to 2.2%.HealthSouth (HLS) broke out of a base-on-base pattern, closing above the 47.99 buy point. Volume was below average, which dampened an otherwise bullish move. Shares rose 3%.Hologic (HOLX) broke out of a flat base, rising past a 46.15 buy point. But it also suffered from weak volume. The relative strength line is at a new high, which backs the breakout. Two days ago, the company said it won FDA approval for its Aptima herpes treatment.Bankrate (RATE) had better volume as it broke out of a pattern with a buy point at 12.05. Volume was about 70% above average as the stock added 1.7%.On the downside, Taylor Morrison Home (TMHC) gapped down to a loss of 3%. In an SEC filing, the company said it priced an offering of 10 million shares, but did not specify the price. It also said in the filing that average sales per community for the two months ended May 31 was 2.9 homes per month vs.  2.2 in the same period in 2016, up 31.8%. Net sales orders for the same two months rose 24.3% and it expects home closings for the quarter ending June 30 to be about 1,800.RELATED:UnitedHealth, HCA, Merck Rally As Senate TrumpCare Bill Pares Near-Term Cuts2 Key Stock Index Plays In Buy Range As Biotechs Surge Again

175,PFE,"Roche (RHHBY) could displace Dow's Pfizer (PFE) in one segment of the lung cancer market, an analyst said Wednesday after the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting highlighted ""additional challenges"" for Pfizer.But on the stock market today, Pfizer fell 0.2% to 32 and Roche 0.4% to 32.09. Late Tuesday, Roche presented data from a head-to-head trial of its drug Alecensa vs. Pfizer's Xalkori.Xalkori was approved in 2011 to treat patients with advanced lung cancer and a specific genetic defect. Alecensa was approved in 2015 for lung cancer patients who progressed on or are intolerant to Xalkori. Both belong to a class of drugs called ALK inhibitors.After 18 months of follow-up, patients treated with Alecensa survived a median 25.7 months without their disease progressing vs. 10.4 months for patients treated with Xalkori.The presenter called Roche's results ""remarkable"" and ""outstanding,"" and ""declared that Alecensa is now the optimal ALK inhibitor for the first-line setting,"" Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said in a note to clients. First-line treatments are the first defense against a disease.""One of the lung cancer doctors we had breakfast with yesterday also acknowledged that Xalkori is a relatively weak ALK inhibitor and she was likely to change her practice patterns based on (the trial),"" he wrote.Divan noted Pfizer is working on a next-generation ALK inhibitor that could help soften the blow of lost Xalkori sales. Also in lung cancer, Pfizer is developing a second-generation drug that targets a specific receptor, known as an EGFR inhibitor.IBD'S TAKE: Biogen (BIIB) spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV) could be nearing a stock breakout after announcing its plan to beef up its pipeline with the acquisition of True North Therapeutics. Head to IBD Stock Analysis for a closer look at Bioverativ's setup.But Pfizer is still struggling vs. newer therapies, particularly those that are considered immuno-oncology drugs. This class aims to block certain interactions involving proteins and enzymes in the immune system that would prevent an immune response.Pfizer's drug, Bavencio, is approved to treat a rare and aggressive skin cancer. Bavencio has shown strong results in liver cancer when combined with Inlyta, Pfizer's liver cancer drug. That should help slow the decline of revenue from Inlyta, Divan said.And though the class of breast cancer drugs known as CDK4/6 inhibitors is about to get more crowded, Pfizer's Ibrance will continue to dominate, Divan said. Though he acknowledged Novartis' (NVS) Kisqali and Eli Lilly's (LLY) abemaciclib have shown strong trial results.In prostate cancer, Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Zytiga will put some pressure on Xtandi, a similar drug Pfizer acquired when it bought Medivation.RELATED:Will Regeneron's Cholesterol-Buster Get Booted In Amgen Battle?Tesaro Crashes Despite Beating AstraZeneca With 'Stronger' DataHow Clovis, AstraZeneca Could 'Muddy' A Potential Deal For Tesaro

176,PFE,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) went to the ""heart of the debate"" on Tuesday, questioning the validity of Amgen's (AMGN) patent on its LDL cholesterol-busting drug, Repatha, an analyst said following a court hearing.But Wall Street was split Wednesday on where the appeals court process would land. Analysts from investment bank Evercore expect Regeneron and Sanofi (SNY) to triumph, whereas a counterpart from Mizuho says there's a 55% chance of Amgen succeeding.On the stock market today, Regeneron rose 0.9% to 482. Amgen climbed 1.3% to 161.66. Shares of Regeneron partner Sanofi were down 1.75% to 48.34.On Tuesday, Regeneron and Amgen battled it out in a 45-minute appeals court hearing. At stake is the fate of Regeneron/Sanofi's drug, Praluent. A judge previously sided with Amgen, saying Regeneron/Sanofi's Praluent infringed Amgen's patent on the drug Repatha.The judge stayed an injunction on Praluent pending the appeals court process. But this is likely the end of the line if the appeals court sides with Amgen, Mizuho analyst Salim Syed said in a note to clients. The Supreme Court takes on very few patent cases.This decision will have broad implications for future patent struggles, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in an audio recording following the meeting. Amgen's patent covers an entire antigen, describing where it binds. Regeneron says this is too broad.""What Regeneron did was they went to the heart of the debate. They said, 'You know what? This patent shouldn't be valid to begin with,'"" he said. ""All Regeneron is saying is (Amgen's) patent should focus on what the invention is, not what it does.""Amgen says Praluent is too similar to its drug Repatha. If antibody patents can be circumvented by ""tweaking an amino acid,"" then there's no point in investing $2 billion in drug development if the return won't be realized, Syed said.IBD'S TAKE: Bioverativ (BIVV), a Biogen (BIIB) spinoff, has a three-year average return growth rate of 196%. See why it could be a smart investment by visiting IBD Stock Analysis.Regeneron noted Dow's Pfizer (PFE), at one time, tried unsuccessfully to develop a similar drug, also belonging to the PCSK9 inhibitor class. If Pfizer held all the intellectual property on PCSK9 inhibitors, neither Repatha nor Praluent would exist.""This example illustrates that even if similar, antibodies are different,"" Syed said. Raffat noted in his report Eli Lilly (LLY) and several others filed a brief in support of Regeneron.It's important to note if Praluent is booted from the market, Amgen's Repatha would be the sole PCSK9 inhibitor on the market. So the case will boil down to policy vs. emotions, Syed said.""If Amgen wins and Praluent is taken off the market, there could be pushback about only having one PCSK9 in the market and lessened competition,"" he said. ""If Praluent was to beat the injunction, that could signal that patents are not as relevant as one may think.""So the judges really seem to be considering the ""ramifications"" of their decision, Evercore analyst Akash Tewari said in the recording. Amgen's strategy of patenting an antigen — broader than an antibody — has yet to be tested in court.RELATED:Regeneron, Sanofi Undercut Amgen, AbbVie In Rheumatoid ArthritisTeva Pharma Ran A Migraine Trial — And Lilly, Amgen BenefitedHow Two Biotechs Fell On Cancer Partnerships With Bristol-Myers

179,PFE,"Tesaro (TSRO) stock plunged Monday despite a Sunday presentation during the American Society for Clinical Oncology meeting that showed its Zejula could be stronger than drugs from AstraZeneca (AZN) in breast cancer.XOn the stock market today, Tesaro stock crashed 5.7% to end the day at 142.48 as shares of rivals AstraZeneca and Pfizer slipped less than 1%. Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and Eli Lilly (LLY) stocks also lost 1% or more.Tesaro and Dow component Merck (MRK) combined their drugs Zejula and Keytruda to treat ovarian and breast cancer patients. Zejula is what's known as a PARP inhibitor. Keytruda is a PD-1 inhibitor. Combining them is thought to offer a more potent response.Half of ovarian cancer patients responded to treatment ""which compares favorably to historical data from either PARP or PD-1 inhibitors alone in this patient population,"" Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez wrote in a note to clients.""While still early, this data appear stronger than the initial results seen with AstraZeneca's Lynparza plus Imfinzi in these tumor types,"" he wrote. Lynparza is a PARP inhibitor and Imfinzi is a PD-1 inhibitor.IBD'S TAKE: Tesaro stock has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 53, which measures the performance of stocks. Get IBD Stock Checkup for a look at better-rated biotechs.Three breast cancer patients had partial responses to the combo. All signs of cancer disappeared in one patient. And a patient with what is known as triple-negative breast cancer — a form that doesn't respond to normal treatments — achieved stability. The company also has seen promising, unconfirmed responses in other patients.In other presentations, AstraZeneca said its Lynparza showed a 2.8-month improvement in progression-free survival over chemotherapy in patients with some forms of breast cancer. But Pfizer showed similar data for its drug talazoparib on Saturday, Fernandez said.""Overall, Lynparza's less severe toxicity profile will likely drive use of the drug over chemotherapy,"" he said. ""The main adverse events associated with Lynparza were nausea and anemia. Neutropenia was the most common adverse event in the chemotherapy arm.""Lilly also presented ""incrementally positive but not groundbreaking"" data for its drug abemaciclib in some forms of breast cancer. Death rates were broadly in line with that of Pfizer's Ibrance. Diarrhea as a side effect was ""manageable,"" Lilly said.Abemaciclib belongs to a class of drugs called CDK4/6 inhibitors. It competes with Novartis' already approved Kisqali. But Lilly says its continuous dosing method of treatment could do more to disrupt cancer cell cycles.RELATED:Did AstraZeneca Rival Just Launch A Potential Blockbuster Drug?Bristol-Incyte Match Beats Dow's Merck In Combination TrialsHow Clovis, AstraZeneca Could 'Muddy' A Potential Deal For Tesaro

181,PFE,"Pfizer (PFE) is awaiting clarification on tax reform before embarking on a merger deal, the Dow component said Tuesday, amid investors' push for an acquisition after second-quarter sales declined again.XInvestors have been clamoring for Pfizer, the No. 3 drugmaker by market cap, to make more acquisitions as sales have fallen over the past three consecutive quarters. Early Tuesday, Pfizer said its second-quarter revenue slipped 2%.On the conference call following its report, Pfizer reaffirmed that there are ""short-term events in the marketplace such as tax reform that may change asset values,"" Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in a note to clients.The Trump administration has made lofty promises regarding tax reform, including a proposal to cut the corporate tax rate to 15%, helping U.S.-domiciled companies and rendering corporate inversions less desirable.Until Washington acts on tax reform, business development like acquisitions is ""somewhat delayed,"" Pfizer reportedly said. ""We need to see tax reform or absence of tax reform, then look at business development activities.""IBD'S TAKE: President Donald Trump's tax vision would benefit some biotechs and drugmakers more than others. Head to IBD's Technology page for a breakdown on who looks likely to benefit most.Over the years, Pfizer's chief method of growing its topline has been making big deals. It acquired Medivation last year in a $14 billion deal. Earlier in the year, it bought Anacor Pharmaceuticals, Bind Therapeutics and Bamboo Therapeutics.But in 2016 it also walked away from a $160 billion deal to acquire Allergan (AGN) amid political controversy linked to Allergan's Ireland tax domicile. The deal would have let Pfizer change its tax domicile to Ireland, thus paying less in taxes.Legacy drugs weighed on Pfizer in the quarter. Its pneumonia drug, Prevnar 13, saw sales decline 8%. Pristiq, a depression drug, lost market exclusivity in the U.S. and toppled 76%. Sales of erectile dysfunction drug Viagra fell 13%.In the meantime, Pfizer is putting its efforts behind further developing an immuno-oncology drug called Bavencio. It's approved to treat a form of skin cancer and bladder cancer. The drug was developed with Germany's Merck KGaA.Bavencio is a PD-L1 inhibitor and competes with rival drugs from AstraZeneca (AZN) and Roche (RHHBY). Like its competitors in the space, Dow's Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) — which have PD-1 inhibitors — Pfizer is looking to combine Bavencio with other drugs.But Pfizer acknowledged Tuesday on the call that AstraZeneca's recent failure in combining two immuno-oncology drugs, Imfinzi and tremelimumab to treat lung cancer, doesn't bode well for similar combinations.The trial indicates ""immuno-oncology/immuno-oncology (combinations) may be more problematic in the near-term,"" Pfizer reportedly said. But Pfizer noted the value of having a PD-L1 inhibitor in its purview. Still others are ""ahead.""On the stock market today, Pfizer fell 0.2% to 33.08.

182,PFE,"Dow Jones component Merck (MRK) remains Credit Suisse's top pick heading into the European Society for Medical Oncology conference in October, but drugmakers Allergan (AGN) and Eli Lilly (LLY) also look strong, the brokerage said Monday.Around that time, Merck is expected to unveil the results of its trial, dubbed Keynote-189, testing immuno-oncology drug Keytruda plus chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with advanced lung cancer. The combo received accelerated approval in May.""We expect continued discussions around the potential uses of Keytruda while awaiting the top-line data from the confirmatory Keynote-189 study in the September/October time frame, which we expect to be positive,"" Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said.On its second-quarter conference call in July, Merck confirmed a cyberattack could delay some products this year, saying ""full recovery from the cyberattack will take some time."" Still, Merck is best-positioned for the remainder of 2017, Divan said in a note to client.Merck shares ended the regular trading session up 0.5% to 62.67.Though investors seem to prefer AbbVie (ABBV) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Divan is placing his bets on Allergan and Lilly. Still, there are several months until Allergan is expected to unveil data in a migraine trial, he said.And though Lilly offers a diverse pipeline, more interest is on Novo Nordisk's (NVO) trial known as Sustain-7, which is looking at its diabetes drug semaglutide vs. Lilly's Trulicity. Divan sees Trulicity as safer than Novo's drug.Lilly is expected to unveil data from a trial of its drug abemaciclib in breast cancer during an upcoming oncology conference, Divan said. Lilly is also planning to file applications for a migraine drug and is driving adoption of new drugs in cancer and plaque psoriasis.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs have struggled lately and are now ranked seventh out of 197 groups tracked by IBD, down from fifth last week. The sector hit a seven-week low Thursday after hitting an 18-month high in July. Head to IBD Industry Themes for more on what happened.Meanwhile, Divan isn't as bullish on the commercial potential of drugs from AbbVie in inflammatory diseases and immuno-oncology. He also calls for ""relatively rapid erosion"" of sales from key drug Humira in the U.S. once generics enter the market, likely in 2022.In Bristol's case, rumors it could become a takeover target have limited its stock in the near term. But early assets in immuno-oncology and potential approvals in kidney and liver cancers could drive upside over time, Divan argued.Credit Suisse also reinstated coverage of Dow stock Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in July, but Divan noted its valuation may be limiting investor interest. This will likely change after J&J's release of data from its Compass trial during the European Society of Cardiology meeting.That meeting is set later this month. J&J is looking at the ability of its anticoagulant, Xarelto, to prevent major adverse cardiac events including cardiovascular death, heart attack and stroke in patients with some heart diseases.""We expect Compass to be the star of the meeting and has the potential to dramatically increase uptake of Xarelto in the coming quarters, something that can move the needle even for a company J&J's size,"" Divan wrote.But Divan also noted he downgraded Pfizer (PFE) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) to neutral ratings from outperform during the quarter. Dow stock Pfizer is struggling with near-term catalysts and a lacking acquisitive appetite amid the potential for tax reform.Teva, on the other hand, is range-bound ""until a new leadership team is in place, a strategy to reduce their debt is more certain and more clarity on the potential of generic versions of Copaxone (a multiple sclerosis drug) 40-milligrams is obtained,"" he wrote.RELATED:Will Pfizer's Cancer Drugs Help It Grow Without A Merger?Generic Drugs Are Rebounding Despite Teva, Mylan Free-FallPerrigo's Beat-And-Raise Lifts Generic Drugs, Bucks Teva-Mylan Trend

184,PFE,"Competing drugs from AstraZeneca (AZN), Pfizer (PFE) and Clovis Oncology (CLVS) could ""muddy the waters"" for a bid on Tesaro (TSRO), an analyst said Thursday, a day after reports emerged that Tesaro could be on the sales block.X Late Wednesday, reports emerged that Tesaro could be seeking bids just two months after its ovarian cancer drug Zejula won Food and Drug Administration approval. But interest has been tepid, according to insiders cited by the Wall Street Journal.Janney analyst Debjit Chattopadhyay says AstraZeneca, Clovis and Pfizer are also working on similar drugs in a class called PARP inhibitors. Poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors appear to improve progression-free survival in patients with ovarian cancer.""Based on the multiple competitive data events and regulatory decisions, which could significantly alter the competitive landscape, we find the timing to be defensive and are not surprised by lukewarm interest,"" he said.In the near future, all three have data that could ""muddy the waters further,"" he said. If Clovis' Rubraca turns out to be as efficient as Tesaro's Zejula in ovarian cancer, Clovis could be better positioned in the market for patients who've already undergone one round of therapy.IBD'S TAKE: Tesaro stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 50, meaning it performs in the middle of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. It falls behind Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN), which has a CR of 97 out of a best-possible 99. Find the best-rated stocks at IBD Stock Checkup.Furthermore, AstraZeneca and Pfizer have data readouts later this year that ""all have implications for Tesaro,"" Chattopadhyay said. Outside PARPs as monotherapies, there's some research going into combining PARPs with immuno-oncology drugs.""Hence, an M&A at a significant premium to current valuation could translate into buyer's remorse down the road,"" he said.Chattopadhyay kept his neutral rating on Tesaro stock. In late-morning trading on the stock market today, Tesaro stock ended the regular trading day down incrementally to 149.22. AstraZeneca stock lifted 1.2% to 34.81. Clovis stock jumped nearly 7% to end the day at 55.21. Pfizer stock was up a fraction, to 32.71.RELATED:Tesaro Spikes On Rumors It's Seeking A TakeoverDid This AstraZeneca Rival Just Launch A Potential Blockbuster Drug?Tesaro Gets A Jump In Ovarian Cancer As Rivalries Heat Up

185,PFE,"X The market ended May with a dull thud, running losses of 0.1% across the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average.It was the Nasdaq's seventh straight monthly advance, ending up 2.4% for May. The S&P 500 managed a 1.1% gain, while the Dow industrials eked out only the thinnest of fractional advances.Data played a key role in Wednesday's action, with the Dow industrials, Nasdaq and S&P 500 opening higher, then reversing sharply after the release of the Chicago Purchasing Manager Index for May at 9:45 a.m. ET, although a corrected version of the PMI showed a much stronger report.The first release of the Chicago PMI showed a reading of 55.2, down hard from the prior month's 58.3 tally and below the consensus view for 57.5. The corrected version showed a May reading of 59.4, its highest mark in 2-1/2 years and well above forecasts.Overnight data out of China showed better-than-expected manufacturing growth in May, but the steel, equipment and mining stocks that would normally react positively to such news came under pressure early in the session. In addition, claims from Libya that production had recovered to above its long-term ceiling of 800,900 barrels helped send crude prices down almost 3%, to $48.32 a barrel, leaving it down 2% for the month.Stocks fell, then gradually regained ground after the release of the Federal Reserve's May Beige Book, which showed continued modest growth, but increasing signs that optimism could be flagging. The report was closely watched because it's the last Beige Book report ahead of the Fed's meeting on interest rates in June, when a majority of investors expect another increase in rates.Pfizer (PFE) led the Dow industrials, up 1.6% after announcing that both the Food & Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency had accepted its submissions to expand the approved use of Sutent to include treatment for recurrent renal cell carcinoma in patients following kidney surgery. Pfizer shares are working on their first weekly advance since late April.Pressure on the S&P 500 came from Michael Kors (KORS), Tenet Healthcare (THC), Southwestern Energy (SWN) and Goldman Sachs (GS).Goldman and JPMorgan (JPM) drove the downside among Dow stocks.  Goldman tumbled 3% and JPMorgan 2% following the revelation by JPMorgan's CFO Marianne Lake, speaking at an investor conference, that the firm's trading revenue was down 15% year over year.Losses were more subdued on the Nasdaq, with O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) and Baidu (BIDU) hardest hit, down 2% apiece. At the top of the Nasdaq 100, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) rose 2.7%, taking a new high.Analog Devices (ADI) thrashed 7% higher at the open, then backtracked to close 1% higher in big trade. The Norwood, Mass.-company reported a big fiscal Q2 earnings win and delivered Q3 revenue and earnings guidance above analyst expectations. Shares ended in a buy range from an 84.34 buy point in a flat base.IBD 50 stock Control4 (CTRL) roared 8% higher in big trade. Needham upgraded the connected-home software developer to buy, with a 22 price target. The stock is extended after an April rebound from the 10-week moving average.Drugmaker Perrigo (PRGO) led the S&P 500, up 6% after a strong first-quarter report.

186,PFE,"French drugmaker Sanofi (SNY) is reportedly considering a bid for Tesaro (TSRO), but could face some competition from Gilead Sciences (GILD), whose frustrated hepatitis C franchise has left the massive biotech thirsty for an acquisition.At the close on the stock market today, Tesaro was up 2.8% to 142.67. Gilead stock popped 1.1% to close at 65.43. Sanofi stock, though, was down 1.3% to close at 47.57.According to insiders cited by StreetInsider, Sanofi is looking to put in a bid on Tesaro, which reportedly began seeking takeover bids last month following the approval and launch of its ovarian cancer drug, Zejula.Gilead is also likely in the running to buy Tesaro, according to reports. Gilead's two biggest drugs to treat hepatitis C, Sovaldi and Harvoni, saw sales dive in 2016 on high cure rates. Now, Gilead has said it's interested in making a deal, particularly one in oncology.But it won't be cheap. Insiders say it'll cost $10 billion (or $185 per share) to acquire the $7.6-billion-market-cap Tesaro. The winner will also get its hands on ovarian cancer drug Zejula, which launched earlier this year with a $118,000 per-year price tag.At that cost, Zejula is less expensive than AstraZeneca's (AZN) Lynparza and Clovis Oncology's (CLVS) Rubraca. And of the three, Zejula's label is broadest, allowing treatment of ovarian cancer patients regardless of specific genetics.IBD'S TAKE: Tesaro stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 52, meaning it outperforms just above half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Visit IBD Stock Checkup for a look at better-rated stocks in the biotech sector.Analysts have speculated that the competitive landscape in what's known as PARP inhibitors — which includes Zejula, Lynparza, Rubraca and a non-approved drug from Pfizer (PFE) — could change as more data from rivals become available this year.Sanofi has struggled to make deals in recent history. Last year, it lost out to Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in a battle for Actelion Pharmaceuticals, and to Pfizer which got its hands on a PARP inhibitor by acquiring Medivation.Gilead, too, is in a position to hunt for deals. Its hepatitis C drugs fell in 2016, and the company said on its most recent earnings call that it will rely on deals for growth, with a special interest in oncology assets. Incyte (INCY) has also been on the radar as a rumored target.Representatives for Tesaro and Sanofi declined to comment to Investor's Business Daily. A representative of Gilead didn't immediately return a request for comment.RELATED:Did AstraZeneca Rival Just Launch A Potential Blockbuster Drug?Why Clovis' Advantage Might Squash Tesaro In Ovarian CancerTesaro Crashes Despite Beating AstraZeneca With 'Stronger' Data

187,PFE,"Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 fell slightly early Monday morning after leading tech stocks such as Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Nvidia (NVDA) suffered their worst losses in months. Meanwhile financials such as Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) continued their recent outperformance.X Futures for the Nasdaq 100, which includes some of the biggest tech stocks, fell nearly 0.2% below fair value. Dow and S&P 500 futures were more than 0.1% under fair value.On Friday, the Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 index and  Russell 2000 all hit all-time intraday highs. But then tech stocks that have been soaring in 2017 suddenly reversed. Apple lost 3.9%, though it did manage to close just above its 50-day line. Facebook, Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX) also tested their 50-day lines. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), the fourth member of the FANG group, did not, but it also lost more than 3%.Nvidia, which at Friday's peak had soared nearly 64% since its May 9 earnings, reversed to lose 6.5%.Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrials ended Friday near session highs, even with Apple, Intel (INTC) and Microsoft (MSFT) suffering big losses. Credit Dow drug components Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK), as well banking giants JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS). Merck, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs all regained their 50-day moving averages.Citigroup extended Thursday's breakout on Friday, closing at 64.45, still in range from a 62.63 buy point. Morgan Stanley tried to clear a 44.96 double-bottom entry, but closed just below that level at 44.91.JPMorgan is 2.5% off a buy point, while Bank of America is about 3% below an aggressive entry.Is this the start of a sustained revival for financials or a temporary move? Don't try to predict the market: Follow the actions of major averages and leading stocks, using the Stock Market Today and The Big Picture. Friday's sell-off pushed market direction to uptrend under pressure.One key factor for bank stocks and the overall market is the Federal Reserve.

188,PFE,"Total prescriptions of Pfizer (PFE) eczema drug Eucrisa have flattened out over recent weeks as Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi's (SNY) Dupixent has picked up steam, according to data from health care tracker MS.After a meteoric rise to 3,500 prescriptions nine weeks after Eucrisa's launch, scripts of the topical eczema ointment have tallied between 3,000 and 4,000 over the past eight weeks. Injection Dupixent has yet to see a dip, hitting 807 prescriptions by week nine.Pfizer attributes the flatter trend to a decrease in free trial vouchers for Eucrisa, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat wrote in a research report. Pfizer estimates a third of total scripts for Eucrisa are from the free trial vouchers.Still ""Eucrisa total prescriptions excluding free trial vouchers are growing well — up 13% in the most recent rolling four weeks vs. the previous four weeks while free trial voucher prescriptions were down 18% in the same period,"" Raffat said.IBD'S TAKE: At least one analyst is predicting another boom in biotech. But it won't be the big names leading the charge, he says. Head to IBD's Technology page for a closer look at which stocks look strong this year.But demand looks likely to continue on an upward trend for Dupixent, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said, citing four physicians working in dermatology.""The biggest takeaways from our discussions were the consistent suggestion that these physicians believe the moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis population is as large or larger than the moderate-to-severe psoriasis population,"" he said.Each physician interviewed expects to start 10-15 patients on Dupixent by year's end.""Physicians would not comment if Dupixent's use in (eczema) could be similar to the percentage of patients who receive biologics treatment for psoriasis,"" he said. ""But (they) believed it had huge potential as physicians gained comparable experience.""Overall, an average 60%-70% of eczema patients seen by the four doctors were adults. But Dupixent has the potential to be a game-changer in pediatric eczema, Porges said. Children are likely to be on the drug longer-term than adults.""The physicians believed 30% of moderate-to-severe (eczema) pediatrics experienced continuing disease into adulthood which they now recognize is associated with more complex multisystem disease than they previously appreciated,"" he said.Dupixent is currently approved only for adults, though is in clinical testing in children.RELATED:IBD 50 Stock Veeva Flies To Record High On 'Another Exceptional Quarter'Regeneron, Sanofi Undercut Amgen, AbbVie in Rheumatoid Arthritis

The Dow held its ground, closing 0.4% higher.A hat trick of negatives hit tech stocks at the end of a confusing news week. A report released late Thursday by Bank of America concluded that the tech sector currently ""trades at its highest relative multiple since the Tech Bubble."" The BofA report alone wasn't enough to restrain the Nasdaq early progress Friday, with the index hauling in a new high, but peaking in the first 45 minutes of trade.IBD 50 stock and recent highflier Nvidia (NVDA) appears to have helped trigger the slide, after a report from short-selling specialist Citron warned of weakness in the chipmaker's core gaming businesses. It also called the price target hike assessed Thursday by Citigroup on Nvidia ""irresponsibly bullish.""Nvidia dived 6.5% in heavy trade, despite a rebound off lows in afternoon trade. Shares remained extended above a 121.02 buy point but the reversal came in the highest volume of the stock's run, a bad sign.The move sent chip stocks sprawling, with IBD's three chip-related groups posting three of the session's four worst losses among industry groups. Ichor Holdings (ICHR), Nova Measurement (NVMI) and Brooks Instruments (BRKS) falling sharply. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS) caved more than 5%. Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI) suffered a 7% loss.The tech sell-off broadened on reports Friday that Goldman Sachs called into question the what it named the FAAMG group of stocks — Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) — declaring the group in a ""valuation air pocket."" Goldman said the group was due for a pause, and had been inappropriately valued as stable, staple issues, acting as key drivers of the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 this year.The combination sent technology industry groups to 19 of Friday's 20 worst performances among all 197 groups tracked by IBD.  The only non-technology industry in that lineup, automakers, were dragged by the heavy-volume 3% loss in the industry's most techish name, Tesla (TSLA).There were winners on Friday.The Dow gained ground, hauled higher by Pfizer's (PFE) 3% advance and gains of better than 2% from JPMorgan (JPM) and Chevron (CVX). Apple tanked more than 4%, but found support at its 10-week moving average. Microsoft dropped 2%.Dillard's (DDS) spiked 10%. J.C. Penney (JCP) and Kohl's (KSS) vaulted 7% each, after the announcement on Thursday that Nordstrom (JWN) was considering a deal to be taken private sent its shares up 10%. The high-end department store gained 6% in heavy trade on Friday.Makers of drilling rigs and equipment, and international oil exploration names rebounded after Thursday's harsh sell-off. Oil prices warmed ever-so-slightly, leaving West Texas intermediate up less than a half percent, still well below $46 a barrel and down almost 4% for the week.Heavy construction firms also found some love on Friday, the last day of President Trump's official ""infrastructure week"" on the bully pulpit.

The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average was up 0.3% and the small-cap Russell 2000 led with a 1.1% pop. Volume in the stock market today was down on the NYSE and up on the Nasdaq.Britain's Conservative Party unexpectedly lost its majority in Parliament, which could complicate talks on Britain's exit from the European Union. This came a day after former FBI chief James Comey ripped President Trump, but the testimony seemed more about honesty than illegality.

A fair number of bank stocks are showing similar action.Citigroup (C) broke out of a flat base Thursday with a 2% gain and added another 2% midday Friday. The stock remains in its 5% buy zone. Citigroup reported Q1 results in April, growing earnings 23%, the best in five quarters and almost 10% above the Street's estimate.Four stocks in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average notched gains of 1% or more. They were Caterpillar (CAT), which is extended from an April breakout; Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which are both trying to retake declining 50-day lines; and Pfizer (PFE), which is attempting to halt a 9% decline that began in early March.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, banks and financials claimed 10 of the day's top 20 up moves.

""And in case you missed it, Veeva is decisively in the winner's bucket.""Veeva belongs to IBD's 18-company Computer Software-Medical industry group, which is up 28% since January. Veeva makes the software backbone for the biggest names in pharma including Eli Lilly (LLY), Novartis (NVS), Pfizer (PFE) and Amgen (AMGN).But now Veeva is looking to expand outside the life sciences market and has ""essentially greenfield opportunities in other regulated industries outside life sciences with QualityOne,"" a next-generation version of the Vault software that it uses to organize clinical trial data.IBD'S TAKE: Veeva is looking for growth outside of life sciences. Visit The New America for an exclusive chat with Chief Executive Peter Gassner on what that new initiative might look like.Still, Veeva added nearly 30 new customers to its Vault offering in the first quarter, and a top-50 pharma began standardizing on Veeva CRM (customer relationship management) software, Chief Executive Peter Gassner said on a late Thursday call with analysts.The number of customers with multiple Vault products — there are 14 — increased more than 70% year over year in the quarter.

Shares of both hit lows last seen in mid-February.Goldman Sachs analyst Jami Rubin removed Lilly from her conviction list, replacing it with IBD 50 member Edwards Lifesciences (EW), ""another product story where we see potential for more upside."" But Lilly stock is still rated buy with a 92 price target.Lilly stock is up 9% year to date vs. the S&P 500, which has risen 7%. Though long-term fundamentals look strong, Lilly is facing near-term risk from a patent battle regarding chemotherapy Alimta. That decision is expected June 3.""It is a unique situation in that Lilly has already won at the District Court and appeals in the U.S. against the same patent,"" Rubin said. ""Usually (the district court) process follows (a patent review).""The likelihood of Lilly losing in the patent review process is low, but could result in earlier-than-expected generic competition vs. Alimta in the U.S. by the second half of 2018, Rubin wrote in a note to clients.Meanwhile, a Food and Drug Administration decision regarding rheumatoid arthritis drug Olumiant is weighing on Lilly stock, she wrote. Earlier this year, the FDA asked for more dosing and safety data on the drug, just two months after European officials signed off on it.IBD'S TAKE: Lilly has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 59, out of a best-possible 99, meaning it outperforms nearly six in 10 stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But it still lags the leader, Zoetis, with a CR of 91. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the top-performing drugmakers.Longer-term, Rubin sees upside from diabetes drug Trulicity, breast cancer drug abemaciclib and migraine drug galcanezumab — though ""it could take time before Lilly gets credit"" for those on Wall Street, Rubin said.Pfizer, on the other hand, was cut to a sell rating from neutral at Citi, and its price target cut to 31 from 38. According to StreetInsider, Citi said Medicare Part D coverage of some of Pfizer's oncology drugs is at risk.Among those, Pfizer counts prostate cancer drug Xtandi, breast cancer drug Ibrance and lung cancer drug Xalkori.Citi analyst Andrew Baum says Pfizer, a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, needs a deal to hit the consensus' view toward profits.

The building products stocks logged gains and the homebuilders resisted downward pressure.The Nasdaq and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.1%. The S&P 500 retreated 0.15%. The small cap Russell 2000 dipped 0.1%. Volume in the stock market today was slightly behind Monday's pace on both major exchanges.Blue chips were roughly evenly divided. Home Depot (HD) advanced 1.5%, the top gainer in the Dow Jones industrial average.

Bulls were hoping the 3D printer stocks could continue their recent rebounds.Going into Tuesday's session, Stratasys was up 81% so far this year, while 3D Systems (DDD) was up 71% and ExOne (XONE) was up 41%.ExOne and 3D Systems were reacting mildly in early trade, up 1.8% and down 3%, respectively.In economic news, housing starts for April came in at 1.172, which was about 2.5% below the Street's consensus number and under the entire range of estimates.

But Novartis' Kisqali grabbed approval this year and Lilly's abemaciclib looks promising.In a Phase 2 trial, Lilly's abemaciclib, combined with chemotherapy, increased progression-free survival to a median 16.4 months vs. 9.3 months for a placebo-chemo combo. Hazard ratio, which measures the likelihood of death, was 0.55.Pfizer's drug Ibrance was combined with chemo in an earlier trial. The combo had a lower hazard ratio at 0.46 — meaning there was a lower risk of death — but it only extended progression-free survival to a median 9.5 months vs. 4.6 months in placebo combo.Comparing the two boils down to which Wall Street sees as a ""better"" effectiveness metric, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat wrote in a report. He notes that the trials studied different populations of breast cancer patients, making an apples-to-apples comparison tricky.Still, diarrhea remains a concern for Lilly's abemaciclib — 86.4% of patients experienced diarrhea vs. 24.7% of patients on the placebo-chemo combination. Lilly advises patients to begin an anti-diarrheal medicine at the first sign of diarrhea.IBD'S TAKE: Want to keep tabs on the market during the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting next month? Bookmark IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News page.The results were presented late Wednesday ahead of the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in June in Chicago. Other abstracts uploaded Wednesday include those from Merck (MRK), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Roche (RHHBY), Tesaro (TSRO), Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY).Incyte (INCY) stock spiked to a month-high Thursday after its epacadostat proved effective in combos with Merck's Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo, outdoing Roche's Tecentriq with NewLink Genetics' (NLNK) rival to epacadostat.But that wasn't Merck's only note of interest. Merck also offered a pair of updates in its ""famous"" trial, dubbed Keynote-024, which has found that Keytruda is better than chemo as a first treatment for advanced lung cancer.The hazard ratio for Keytruda dropped to 0.69 from 0.9, Merck said. Although this is ""not statistically significant, the favorable trend may have helped them in recent FDA approval,"" Evercore's Raffat said in a note.Merck's Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo are what's known as immuno-oncology drugs. They work to block the interaction between a PD-1 protein on an immune system cell and a PD-L1 protein on a cancer cell to help the immune system identify the cancer.In its Keynote-024 trial, Merck also found lung-cancer patients treated with Keytruda in their initial round saw continued benefit from Keytruda in the second round if the cancer progressed. This cements ""the role for PD-1 (inhibitors) in first-line (treatment) even further,"" Raffat said.In a Phase 1 trial, Regeneron and Sanofi found their PD-1 drug, known as REGN-2810, had a benefit rate of 52% for patients with a common form of skin cancer. The drug had a 70% control rate, ""which is very encouraging in this disease setting,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said.The American Cancer Society estimates that 5.4 million patients are diagnosed with and 20,000 die of basal and squamous cell skin cancers each year in the U.S. Longer term, there might be potential for REGN-2810 to treat patients with advanced, but not necessarily fatal, skin cancers.Of the 26 patients enrolled in Regeneron/Sanofi's trial, one showed a complete response of 19 months — meaning all discernible signs of cancer disappeared. Porges kept his outperform rating on Regeneron stock.Though there was ""little of note"" in Tesaro's abstract ahead of the conference, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez says the most interesting data presented next month will be a combination trial of Tesaro's Zejula and Merck's Keytruda in breast and ovarian cancer.Zejula competes vs. AstraZeneca (AZN) and Clovis Oncology (CLVS) in a class of drugs called PARP inhibitors which works to block a specific enzyme to treat ovarian cancer. PARP inhibitors are currently being investigated in breast cancer as well.Combining a PARP inhibitor and an immuno-oncology drug like Merck's Keytruda is thought to be more potent in treating cancer. Tesaro is also looking at Zejula plus a PD-1, like Keytruda, in advanced lung cancer.The company is slated to present data from a dozen patients treated with Zejula and Keytruda. Fernandez notes that the bar is fairly low to outperform. Alone, PD-1 inhibitors have a 10%-15% response rate in this group of patients. PARP inhibitors have a mid-20% response rate.""Although recently published data from a small trial of AstraZeneca's Imfinzi (a PD-L1 inhibitor) plus Lynparza (a PARP inhibitor) showed a somewhat disappointing 17% response rate in 10 ovarian cancer patients, Tesaro believes the combination of a PD-1 antibody plus Zejula will be superior,"" Fernandez said.RELATED:Incyte Teams Up With Dow's Merck To Trounce Roche In CancerDid AstraZeneca Rival Just Launch A Potential Blockbuster Drug?

197,PFE,"X The stock market opened on an up note early Wednesday after overnight positive manufacturing data out of China. However, gains were quickly pared and all three major indexes turned red after Chicago PMI hit its lowest level since January. The Nasdaq lagged with a 0.6% loss, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.3% each.Among the Dow industrials, medical components Pfizer (PFE), Merck (MRK), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) found themselves at the head of the pack. Pfizer gained 1.3%, while Merck and JNJ followed up with gains of 0.8% each.In early trading, the blue chip's laggards were financial components Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan (JPM), falling 3% and 1.8%, respectively.On the S&P 500, Analog Devices (ADI) surged over 4% after its big Q2 earnings beat. The chipmaker handily exceeded its sales and earnings targets while providing an optimistic outlook for the current quarter. The stock broke out of a cup base with a 84.34 buy point on Tuesday.On the downside, energy names found themselves at the bottom of the S&P 500's performers for a second straight day as oil prices plunged again. Crude dropped 2.9%. Transocean (RIG) dropped 4.4%, while Chesapeake Energy (CHK) fell 2.7%.Retail stocks were showing mixed action in the stock market today. Michael Kors (KORS) fell another 7% to a five-year low after its fiscal-Q4 earnings release resulted in weak same-store sales and a gloomy outlook. Quarterly earnings have declined for a four consecutive quarters, capped off by a 28% decline in the quarter reported. The retailer plans to close 100-125 stores over the next two years. Women's apparel retailer J. Jill (JILL) shot up almost 12% after its top- and bottom-line beat.Leading retailer Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) will report its Q1 earnings after the close today. The stock is well-extended from a 33.55 flat-base buy point.Action in the IBD 50 was predominantly negative as the general market reversed lower after the open. On the downside, Chemours (CC) dropped almost 6%, while fiberoptics stock Lumentum (LITE) moved down almost 4%. Stamps.com (STMP) fell hard for a second straight day after last week's breakout. Shares were down almost 2%.On the upside, Control4 (CTRL) rose 2.5%, while New Oriental Education (EDU) moved up 1.6%.An initial data release suggested Chicago-region manufacturing fell off sharply in May, sending Kingsbury International's Chicago Purchasing Managers Index to a reading of 55.2.  That was well below April's 58.3 tally, as well as economist projections for a downtick to 57.5. The release was later corrected, showing the Chicago PMI at 59.4 for May, well above expectations.RELATED:Michael Kors Dives On Outlook, Will Shut 100-125 Stores; J.

198,PFE,"Ask Wall Street analysts to name possible catalysts for a rise in big-cap technology stocks like Apple (AAPL) and Cisco Systems (CSCO), and near the top on most lists would be Trump administration plans to allow companies to bring foreign profits into the U.S. at a reduced tax rate.Analysts say cash brought back could be a piggy bank for company stock repurchases or acquisitions. Problem is, President Trump's economic agenda has been stalled amid White House drama.The proposed changes on ""repatriated"" cash are part of a bigger Trump tax reform package. Randall Stephenson, AT&T's (T) CEO, says tax reform can make it through Congress.""A lot of people are getting pessimistic because of a lot of the noise in Washington right now that tax reform may not be achieved,"" Stephenson said at a JPMorgan tech conference on May 23. ""I am still optimistic something can still get done … bundling tax reform with an infrastructure bill would be big. I think it's achievable.""Even so, one worry is that the overseas ""tax holiday"" for tech firms may not turn out as the bonanza it's made out to be. That depends on whether legislation puts conditions on how money could be spent and creates enforcement mechanisms.Rather than see the money go toward company stock buybacks or acquisitions, Trump and Congress could steer money toward job creation and capital spending, says a UBS analyst.""If the (Trump administration) wants to really drive inward investments within the U.S. there might have to be some sort of mandated use of cash, maybe to spend it on (capital expenditures). As yet, we do not know,"" UBS analyst Geoff Robinson said in a report.There's reason to think Robinson might be on the right track.""There's trillions of dollars offshore. We want to get that back into America,"" Gary Cohn, Trump's chief economic advisor, said in a recent interview. ""We want the companies to bring the money back and put it back into the economy. We want them to create jobs.""Cash-rich tech companies like Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Cisco currently would pay a 35% tax on so-called ""repatriated earnings."" Rather than take the tax hit, they've kept the money overseas.President Trump has proposed a one-time tax of 10% on offshore earnings while the Republican-controlled House has proposed a lower 8.5% rate.The overseas tax-break that Congress passed in 2004 was called the American Jobs Creation Act, but didn't do much to stimulate the economy, analysts say. The AJCA taxed repatriated earnings at a 5.25% rate.The top five firms in bringing back cash in 2004 were drug companies Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK), as well as Hewlett-Packard, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and IBM (IBM). According to the IRS, $312 billion was brought back in all.However, only 10% of companies eligible to bring back cash in 2004 did so, says Richard Lane, an analyst at Moody's Investor Service. Many companies kept cash overseas because of AJCA requirements, he said.The AJCA required companies to reinvest tax savings in worker hiring and training, infrastructure, research and development and capital projects. According to UBS, however, ""Funds in 2004's repatriation may have been earmarked for capital investment but ultimately were spent in large part on share repurchases.""UBS says that happened because the AJCA did not include a ""tracking mechanism"" so the government could audit companies and gauge compliance. The Trump administration could put better enforcement mechanisms in place.S&P 500 companies have more than $2.6 trillion in overseas cash. Some of that may be needed to continue funding foreign operations.The companies currently with the most overseas cash are Apple, Microsoft, Cisco, Google and Oracle (ORCL), Moody's says.While Cisco has stated any cash brought back to the U.S. could be used for reducing debt on its books, analysts have other ideas.If a tax holiday is approved, BMO Capital Markets said in a report that it ""expects Cisco and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to focus more on acquisitions, while Apple and smaller companies would likely lean more toward capital return.""In the case of Apple and Cisco, some analysts envision enough cash being brought back to fund ""transformative"" deals. Apple has about $250 billion in cash, growing at about $50 billion a year. About 90% of Apple's cash is overseas. A one-time, 10% repatriation tax would give Apple some $220 billion for acquisitions or buybacks, Citigroup analyst Jim Suva said in a report. Suva speculated that Apple could buy large companies such as Netflix (NFLX), Walt Disney (DIS) or Electronic Arts (EA).Cisco, meanwhile, could bring back up to $56 billion in cash from overseas, analysts say. In a report, Credit Suisse speculates that enterprise software providers ServiceNow (NOW), Splunk (SPLK), or computer security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW) could be on Cisco's shopping list. Pacific Crest Securities adds Red Hat (RHT) and Nutanix (NTNX) to the list of possible Cisco targets.Intel (INTC) is among semiconductor companies with a cash hoard overseas. Intel could bring back about $12 billion, says BMO Capital Markets. Nvidia (NVDA) and Qualcomm (QCOM) also have significant overseas cash. But, BMO Capital does not expect a Trump tax holiday to spur an acquisition spree among chipmakers.

199,PFE,"Fast-food restaurant operator Yum Brands (YUM) was upgraded to buy, while drug giant Pfizer (PFE) was downgraded to sell by Wall Street analysts Tuesday. Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of a host of medical and pharmaceutical companies, rating Baxter International (BAX) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) at buy and Abbott Laboratories (ABT) at hold.Argus Research upgraded Yum Brands stock to buy from hold. Yum operates and franchises KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurants.Yum stock rose 0.2% to 69.36 on the stock market today. It broke out of a cup base with a buy point of 69.08 on May 5 and remains in the buy zone. It hit a record regular-session trading high of 69.43 on May 8.On May 3, Louisville, Ky.-based Yum reported better-than-expected revenue and earnings in the first quarter thanks to strong sales at Taco Bell.Citigroup downgraded shares of Pfizer to sell. The stock was down 1.6% to 32.60 Tuesday.Pfizer stock has formed a saucer-with-handle chart pattern with a buy point of 34.85 over the past 41 weeks.On May 2, New York, N.Y.-based Pfizer reported mixed first-quarter results as earnings topped views, but sales came up short.Goldman initiated coverage of Baxter with a buy rating and price target of 71. It started surgical robot maker Intuitive Surgical at buy and a price target of 1,000. But it began coverage of Abbott Labs with a hold rating and price target of 45.Baxter rose 1.55% to 57.58, hitting a fresh all-time high. Intuitive Surgical rose climbed 1% to 859.47, also setting a record high.

200,PFE,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Biogen (BIIB) would benefit the most among biotechs under President Trump's proposed tax reform, a measure that would cut the corporate tax rate by 20%.Under Trump's proposal ""no business of any size, from a Fortune 500 to a mom-and-pop shop to a freelancer living job to job, will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes,"" making corporate inversions unnecessary."" The U.S. corporate tax rate is currently 35%.That means Regeneron, Gilead and Biogen — all of which have guided to adjusted tax rates at or above 25% in 2017 — could see a serious boost in cash if Trump's proposal passes. Though, analysts say, it's all about compromise inside the Beltway, so that 15% rate is still up in the air.Trump's approval rating jumped to 39% in May from 34% in April, and he gained 7% in the IBD/TIPP Presidential Leadership Index after unveiling his tax reform proposal. It was the first month-over-month increase since Trump became president.But that doesn't mean Big Pharma and biotech are totally sold on Trump's proposal — a four-page document released April 26. Shares of biotechs and drugmakers collectively lifted less than 1% that day, though generic drug stocks popped 2.8%.Gilead Chief Executive John Milligan noted uncertainty in Washington is the norm.""So I think we've kind of learned to filter that out and focus on the things that are right for the company,"" he said on Gilead's May 2 first-quarter earnings conference call. ""There may be tax reform. There may be repatriation. But you can't count on it and you can't wait for it, either.""Trump's plan would slash the U.S. corporate tax rate to 15% from 35%, benefiting companies whose consolidated tax rates remain well above that level. Consolidating taxes allows a firm to treat a group of wholly- or majority-owned companies as a single entity for tax purposes.U.S.-domiciled drugmakers typically pay 37%-40% in consolidated taxes, Canaccord analyst Dewey Steadman told Investor's Business Daily. But companies that acquire a foreign firm can move their tax domicile outside the U.S. to the acquired company's often lower-tax homeland.When Mylan (MYL) acquired a generics manufacturer from Abbott Laboratories (ABT) in 2014, it kept its operational headquarters in Pennsylvania, but reincorporated in the Netherlands. In March, Mylan said it expected to pay a 16.5%-18.5% tax rate in 2017.Similarly, Allergan (AGN) guided in February to a 13.5% adjusted tax rate in 2017. Allergan's corporate headquarters are in Ireland. In April 2016, Pfizer (PFE) scrapped its $160 billion attempt to acquire Allergan a day after the U.S. Treasury unveiled new rules to curb inversions.Former President Barack Obama called global tax avoidance a ""huge problem"" and urged Congress to close the loophole for good. Trump, on the other hand, says his tax reform proposal would make inversions unnecessary ""by making America's tax rate one of the best in the world.""Regeneron, Gilead and Biogen would be among the biggest winners of this cut, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in an April 26 report. Regeneron has guided to an effective tax rate of 32%-38% in 2017. Gilead sees 25%-28%. In the first quarter, Biogen paid 23% in adjusted taxes.Among drugmakers, Pfizer, Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) all guided to effective tax rates between 20%-25% for 2017. Canaccord's Steadman and Mizuho analyst Salim Syed told IBD everything in politics is subject to negotiation.""Smaller biotechs say it's obviously positive for the future, but everyone is taking a wait-and-see approach,"" Steadman said. ""A 20%-22% rate is probably what's going to happen, but they're not changing their capital expenditures or organizational structure in the meantime.""IBD'S TAKE: Looking for the latest on biotech and drug news? Be sure to bookmark IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News page.A second facet of Trump's plan would allow the one-time repatriation of corporate cash parked overseas at a discounted 10% tax rate. This would be followed by an end to the deferral of taxes on corporate income earned abroad.Evercore's Raffat says Amgen (AMGN) would benefit the most among drugmakers under this provision. Amgen has $34.4 billion in cash stashed overseas. That's money Amgen could use to help boost its war chest amid generic rivalries and a battle with Regeneron/Sanofi (SNY) on the cholesterol front.The same could be said for Gilead — $27.4 billion in overseas cash — which is facing dwindling sales in its hepatitis C drug franchise. Gilead had been under pressure for months amid analyst chatter that it should buy something to bolster sales. Incyte (INCY) is a likely candidate, analysts say.According to Raffat, Merck and Pfizer have a respective $21.9 billion and $15 billion in cash outside the U.S. Lilly, Bristol, Celgene (CELG), Biogen and AbbVie (ABBV) each have under $10 billion parked overseas. That cash could be repatriated for research and development, or used to fuel M&A.Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read offered a similar view as Gilead's Milligan on the company's May 2 first-quarter earnings conference call. Though he expects industry consolidation to continue over time, the political atmosphere remains a major deterrent.""I believe there is simply too much redundancy and fragmentation, both globally and in the U.S., for the sector to continually efficiently deliver medicines to society,"" he said. ""However, there is a lack of clarity on potential tax reform, health care policies of the U.S. and uncertainties in the European markets.""Canaccord's Steadman doesn't expect a wave of M&A even if Trump's tax reform passes muster with Congress. There's no need to attempt Pfizer-Allergan-like mergers for inversion purposes, he said. Though the appetite for U.S. biotechs looks healthy.""We'd see a decline in those big inversion-type mergers that were not necessarily strategic, but you could see an appetite for U.S. biotech assets just because the tax picture looks better,"" he said. ""The net result is actually a decrease in large mergers but maybe an increase in valuations for biotech, but I don't think it drives much more M&A.""There's much that's still murky in Trump's tax proposal, analysts say.""The general theme is tax reform would be a good thing for biotech,"" Mizuho's Syed told IBD. ""But we don't exactly know what tax reform is going to be. There are still a lot of pieces moving around. Repatriation? A border tax? We don't have all the components of it.""A border tax, though, could be an extreme drawback for U.S. companies with manufacturing in less expensive countries. Such an adjustment could exempt exports from taxation, while taxing imports, PwC analysts Doug Strang and Kathy Michael wrote in a Feb. 6 report.In a January speech at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said a tax would eliminate the tax incentives for U.S. companies to move their manufacturing overseas.""Coupled with the new lower GOP tax rates on local businesses and ending double-taxation of U.S. earnings overseas, this establishes America as a 21st century magnet for new jobs, technology breakthroughs and headquarters,"" he said. ""The GOP tax plan is already driving companies to ask themselves, 'How soon can we bring our suppliers back to the U.S.?'""For most companies, relocating their operations back to the U.S. would be a ""paperwork nightmare,"" Canaccord's Steadman said. In the current plan — which doesn't include a border tax provision — there's nothing to incentivize companies to bring operations back to the U.S.But it could be enough to keep newer and smaller companies from re-domiciling overseas, he said.""It's probably enticing future companies to not leave the U.S., I think that's the core goal of what they're trying to do,"" he said. ""If they were U.S.-domiciled at a lower rate, they wouldn't have to leave cash in a foreign subsidiary and that cash would be based in the U.S. which would encourage investment in the U.S.""RELATED:Did Gilead Just Provide Some 'Incyte' Into A Potential Deal?Dow's Pfizer Tops Earnings Views But Sales Come Up ShortHow Lilly's New Drug Could Spark A Deeper Rivalry With Pfizer, Novartis

201,PFE,"Eagle Pharmaceuticals (EGRX) and Depomed (DEPO) stocks plunged Thursday after a Mizuho analyst slashed her price targets on a slew of drugmakers including No. 1 generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA).Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler cited risky guidance for her price-target cuts on Teva and Depomed stocks. She is more bullish on Dermira (DERM), a skin-care firm, but trimmed her price target on prescription trends in dermatology. Eagle stock, meanwhile, is too ""expensive,"" she said.On the stock market today, Depomed stock fell 2.3% to 10.39 and Eagle 3.3% to 73.89. Teva stock lost 0.9% to 28.71, but Dermira stock rose 1.2% to 27.85. Koffler sees Dermira as a takeout candidate in 2018.Koffler cut her price target on Teva stock to 25 from 29, and kept her underperform rating. She cited ""expectations of contraction via further asset sales, general pricing pressure, Copaxone (issues) and minimal pipeline contribution.""She removed sales of laquinimod from her model. Laquinimod was being developed to treat relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, but failed in a recent trial, forcing Teva to focus instead on laquinimod in primary-progressive MS and Huntington's disease.IBD'S TAKE: Keep up with the drugmaking industry by bookmarking IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News page.Meanwhile, Teva is likely to experience more pressure against its blockbuster MS drug Copaxone. In January, a district court judge tossed out four of five patents protecting the drug, opening Teva up to competition from Mylan (MYL), Pfizer (PFE) and Momenta Pharmaceuticals (MNTA).Koffler kept a neutral rating on Depomed stock, but cut her price target to 11 from 13, noting a weak long-term outlook in the opioid market. Depomed makes pain-management drugs including Nucynta.Though first-quarter sales and profits missed expectations, Koffler likes ""the pragmatism of new CEO Arthur Higgins, who made rapid decisions to stabilize product declines and lower operating expenses."" Lowered guidance for 2017 now feels more achievable, she said.Eagle stock, on the other hand, is just too expensive, Koffler wrote in a note to clients. It's unlikely to be a takeout candidate in 2017, so Koffler cut her price target on shares to 57 from 66. Like Teva, Eagle stock also has an underperform rating.For the first quarter, Eagle reported consensus-topping revenue and profits that met. But Koffler lowered her expectations of a 2017 takeout to 20% from 40%, noting uncertainties associated with its chemotherapy Bendeka and a likely slow ramp for Ryanodex in exertional heat stroke.But Dermira grabbed bullish views. Prescription trends in dermatology are currently soft, so Koffler cut her price target on Dermira stock to 40 from 42, though she is buy-rated on shares noting she views ""the company as an attractive 2018 takeout candidate.""Dermira stock sold off recently after an unexpected convertible debt financing, but Koffler expects the stock to rebound on its ""innovative pipeline"" and the potential for a takeout. The stock now looks derisked from any additional financing in the next year, she said in a note.RELATED:Did Neurocrine Just Leave The Door Open For Teva In Tourette's?Can Teva Hold Its Own In Bringing Migraine Drugs To MarketTeva Pharma Q1 Sales Lag As key Multiple Sclerosis Drug Topples

202,PFE,"Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) said Thursday it increased the price of its multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone to partially offset a 4% dip in global first-quarter sales — but shares fell as total revenue missed Wall Street's views.On the stock market today, Teva stock rose 2% to 32 after earlier falling as much as 3.7%. Shares are down for the year amid an antitrust probe into generics including Teva, Mylan (MYL) and Perrigo (PRGO).For the first quarter ended March 31, Teva reported adjusted income of $1.06 a share on $5.63 billion in sales. Profits topped by 3 cents, but declined 14% year over year. Sales missed the $5.68 billion view, but grew 17% vs. last year.Generic medicine sales of $3.1 billion grew 24% and comprised 54% of total sales, up from the 51% chunk it represented in the year-earlier period. Teva noted its acquisition of Actavis helped boost the segment in the quarter. Revenue from Teva's specialty drug unit declined 6% to $2 billion.Teva blamed lower sales of its central nervous system and respiratory drugs for the decrease in specialty medicines. To help offset that, Teva received a $75 million payment from a Takeda subsidiary which bought the royalties and rights to multiple myeloma drug Ninlaro.Copaxone, though, saw 4% fewer sales in the quarter. In the U.S., revenue for the multiple sclerosis drug fell 5% to $782 million ""partially offset by a price increase of 7.9% for both Copaxone products in January 2017,"" Teva said. Teva sells 20-milligram and 40-milligram doses of Copaxone.IBD'S TAKE: Generic drug stocks toppled last week after federal officials searched Perrigo's offices as part of a widespread price-fixing investigation. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a deeper look at the companies facing Department of Justice scrutiny.Outside the U.S., Copaxone revenue grew 2% to $188 million, but Teva faces looming Copaxone competition. In February, a Delaware court ruled invalid four key patents protecting the drug, siding with Mylan. Pfizer (PFE) and Momenta Pharmaceuticals (MNTA) are working on Copaxone copies.Respiratory products also toppled 17% in the first quarter, bringing in $304 million in revenue. Sales from asthma inhalers ProAir and Qvar declined 30% and 27%, respectively. Teva noted that wholesaler and retailer inventory reductions, as well as net pricing effects, played into the dips.Teva also said Michael McClellan will serve as interim chief financial officer, effective July 1, following the planned departure of Eyal Desheh. Before joining Teva, McClellan had a 20-year-plus career at Sanofi (SNY).RELATED:Mylan Q1 Revenue Falls Short Of Views As EpiPen Sales DeclineTeva Downgraded On Lost MS Drug Patents, DOJ Probe

203,PFE,"The failure of Roche's (RHHBY) Tecentriq in a late-stage trial as a bladder cancer drug could bode badly for not only the company but several of its rivals, though it appears Merck (MRK) may come out ahead, an analyst suggested Wednesday.Early Wednesday, Roche said its immuno-oncology drug Tecentriq failed to improve overall survival vs. chemotherapy in a Phase 3 trial of bladder cancer patients who had already received chemotherapy.Later in the day, however, Merck's Keytruda won a key approval, though it was not for bladder cancer. After the close, the Food and Drug Administration gave the nod for Keytruda to treat what is known as metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer in conjunction with chemotherapy.Shares of Merck jumped 3.1% in after-hours trading to 65.90. During the regular session, Merck gained 1% to 63.94.While Tecentriq's approval as a treatment for bladder cancer could be at risk, wrote Evercore analyst Umer Raffat in a note to clients, Merck's Keytruda could simply be a better drug than it or any of its other rivals. Keytruda is expected to gain full approval in bladder cancer, based on a trial in which it topped chemo in improving patients' overall survival rate.Last year, in another trial, Keytruda improved progression-free survival in lung cancer patients to a median 10.3 months vs. six months for chemo. In a similar trial, Bristol-Myers' (BMY) Opdivo improved progression-free survival to a median 4.2 months vs. 5.9 months for chemo.""We now have a second cancer indication where Merck's Keytruda worked but a competitor PD-1 or PD-L1 didn't,"" he said. ""This is one of those data points that makes you pause for a second.""Tecentriq's accelerated approval for bladder cancer was contingent on the Phase 3 results. The FDA warned that if the drug failed it could ""withdraw this approval.""Drugs from three of Roche's rivals — Pfizer's (PFE) Bavencio, Bristol's Opdivo and Merck's Keytruda — all belong to a class of drugs that block the interaction between a PD-1 protein on an immune system cell and the PD-L1 protein on the surface of a cancer cell to help the immune system identify the cancer. Tecentriq has a slightly different mechanism. It works by targeting the PD-L1 protein on the cancer cell.Like Tecentriq, Bavencio and Opdivo have accelerated approvals in second-line bladder cancer. Evercore's Raffat questioned whether Tecentriq's results demonstrate a broader problem with immuno-oncology drugs in bladder cancer.""Is there a broader risk to (immuno-oncology) monotherapy in this indication?"" he asked. ""We note that Bristol-Myers had a slightly higher (overall response rate) in this indication than Pfizer and Roche.""IBD'S TAKE: The immuno-oncology market could be worth $25 billion by 2025, just taking into account the protein and enzyme targets already identified, an analyst says. Visit IBD's Technology page for a deep dive on the industry.On the stock market today, Roche stock ended trading down nearly 2% to 33.18. Shares hit a 32.72 buy point on April 26 out of a cup-with-handle that began forming last June.Bristol-Myers stock sank a fraction, to 55.14, then lost another 1.7% to 54.23 after hours. Pfizer was down fractionally both in the regular session and after hours.Tecentriq's failure in bladder cancer puts Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez's model at risk. Previously, Fernandez modeled $2.3 billion in peak worldwide bladder cancer sales for PD-1 and PD-L1 immuno-oncology drugs.He expected Tecentriq to take 40% of the market, and Keytruda to seize 30%, followed by Opdivo at 20% and AstraZeneca's (AZN) Imfinzi, a PD-L1 antibody, with 10%. Pfizer's Bavencio could also ""gain modest share as well,"" he said.RELATED:Bristol-Myers 'Too Risky' To Acquire As Merck, Roche Pile On PressureBristol-Myers Beats Gilead, Merck To Key Approvals In China, EuropeDid Gilead Just Provide Some 'Incyte' Into A Potential Deal?

204,PFE,"Stocks racked up commendable gains in light trade Monday, hauling both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average further above their 50-day moving averages.The session opened boosted by Saturday's announcement of more than $300 billion in long-term deals between U.S. manufacturers and Saudi Arabia, a set of bargains timed to correspond with President Trump's first trip to Saudi Arabia. The news lifted defense plays led by Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN), as well as National Oilwell Varco (NOV) and others.  Boeing and Lockheed Martin ended up nearly 2%.Ford (F) held its early gain, ending Monday up more than 2% after announcing it had replaced Chief Executive Mark Fields with Jim Hackett, the former CEO of Steelcase (SCS) who has headed Ford's Smart Mobility experimental operations unit. Fields held the CEO seat for three years. Ford shares have been in a 34-month decline.The Nasdaq composite led, up 0.8%, as more than 10% of the Nasdaq 100 stocks climbed more than 2%.  Autodesk (ADSK) led the Nasdaq 100, up more than 3% to a new high and adding to the 15% gain posted last week. Fiber optic telecom stocks posted the session's best gain among industries, boosted by a handful of analyst reports. Acacia Communications (ACIA), Applied OptoElectronics (AAOI) and Finisar (FNSR) each gained more than 10%.Makers of medical software also scored high, skewed higher by a 23% gain by the thinly traded Polarityte (COOL).  Group leader Veeva Systems (VEEV) is extended. But peer Cerner (CERN) is trading just below a 66.37 buy point in a four-weeks tight pattern.The Dow Jones industrial average scaled up 0.5%. Cisco Systems (CSCO) led the index, rebounding 2% as it looked to salvage support at its 40-week moving average after diving 7% in gale-force volume last week.Losses among blue chips were generally modest, Pfizer's (PFE) fell hardest among the Dow industrials, down 1%.The S&P 500 scored a 0.6% gain. Jack Daniels distiller Brown Forman (BFB) ran atop the list with an 8% gain, clearing its prior high from August 2015.Chipmaker Qorvo (QRVO) sped 4% higher and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) jumped 3%, both taking new highs.Defense consultant Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) spiked 6%, possibly aided by Saturday's announcement of more than $300 billion in U.S-Saudi defense deals, but also because it reported first-quarter earnings and revenue above expectations, and hosted its full year revenue guidance past consensus targets.  The gap up gain lifted shares just above a 37.79 buy point in a flat base.RELATED:Dow Jones Industrial Average and Dow Stocks: News & AnalysisTop Housing Stocks Near Buy Points: Investing Action Plan

206,PFE,"Remember Apple's (AAPL) popular ""There's an app for that"" catchphrase?Perhaps the same could be said for exchange traded funds. At least the industry appears headed in that direction.Whether you support gender diversity, prefer religious-oriented investments or believe in Millennials' spending power, there's an ETF for you. Those are just a few of the new wave of thematic ETFs that came on the scene last year.One of last year's most successful launches is SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity Index (SHE), which brought in $313 million in assets as of May 19. State Street Global Advisors' March offering tracks the SSGA Gender Diversity Index, which is made up of large-cap companies that show diversity in their senior leadership. Pfizer (PFE), Amgen (AMGN) and PepsiCo (PEP) are its three largest holdings.Daily trading volume is about 9,000 shares. Its gross expense ratio is 0.20%, according to independent industry researcher Morningstar Inc. How does diversity work as an investment? The fund is up about 10% from its March 2016 debut and 5% year to date.April brought about Global X S&P 500 Catholic Values (CATH), with $96.9 million in assets and average daily volume of about 17,000. It tracks the S&P 500 Catholic Values Index. The ETF's top big-cap holdings as of May 17 included Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Microsoft (MSFT).The fund invests in companies whose business practices meet the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' socially responsible guidelines. Its expense ratio is 0.39%. It's up about 8% this year and 20% in the past year, in line with the broad stock market.Global X Millennials Thematic ETF (MILN), launched in May last year, aims to invest in companies that provide products and services Millennials are likely to use. Top 10 holdings as of May 17 included Alphabet, Apple, Facebook (FB), Netflix (NFLX) and PayPal (PYPL). The ETF tries to provide investment results similar to the price and yield performance of the Indxx Millennials Thematic Index and carries a gross expense ratio of 0.68%. It has $5.2 million AUM and an average daily volume of around 3,000 shares. It's up about 11% this year and 19% from a year ago.August saw the launch of Principal Millennials Index ETF (GENY), which has a similar goal, tracks the Nasdaq Global Millennial
"
207,PFE,"Opportunity Index. It has a 0.45% expense ratio and $7 million AUM. It's up 12% so far this year.While these ETFs vary widely by niche and tend to garner initial attention, many fail to attract sizable assets or daily trading volume. Which begs the question: Are thematic ETFs too trendy or do they have staying power?""A common thread among them is that they're preying on investors' impulse to chase what's hot,"" Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research for Morningstar, said in a December report. ""These funds tend to offer narrow and often overly complex exposures, charge high fees, and have sponsors that prioritize salability over staying power.""""There were a host of thematic ETFs that were launched in 2016, covering a wide variety of trending topics (3-D printing, the obesity epidemic, video game technology, you name it),"" Johnson wrote. ""This made it difficult to pick just one for my short list of 2016's worst.""His pick? Spirited Funds/ETFMG Whiskey&Spirits (WSKY), which has $2.8 million in assets. The fund is up 16% year to date.""This fund has 79% of its portfolio invested in its top 10 holdings, with top holding Diageo (DEO) alone soaking up nearly 23% of its assets,"" he wrote. ""The fund charges an annual fee of 0.75%, a hefty price to pay for a concentrated bet on booze. Investors would be well-served to leave this one on the shelf.""Of the 247 new ETFs launched last year, 19 were thematic funds, according to Ron Rowland, founder and executive editor of Invest With An Edge.""Thematic ETFs have been around for years, but there was a noticeable increase in launch activity in 2016,"" he wrote in a January article. ""Some of the new themes are (Financial Technology), drones, longevity, millennials, 3D printing and obesity.""RELATED:Like Tesla And Mobileye? Thematic ETFs Hold More Stocks Like Them

208,PFE,"Merck (MRK) on Tuesday reported better-than-expected results for the first quarter and raised its outlook for 2017, but shares dipped on light sales of cancer drug Keytruda and diabetes medicine Januvia.The company, a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, disclosed adjusted income of 88 cents a share on revenue of $9.43 billion, down 1% and up 1%, respectively. Analysts had expected the No. 4 drugmaker to report earnings of 83 cents a share on sales of $9.25 billion.Merck now sees 2017 adjusted income of $3.76 to $3.88 a share, up from its previous range of $3.72 to $3.87 a share. The company's forecast also calls for revenue of $39.1 billion to $40.3 billion, up from its previous range of $38.6 billion to $40.1 billion. Analyst views call for adjusted income of $3.81 a share on sales of $39.72 billion.Merck stock closed up 0.5% at 62.70 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Follow the slurry of biotech and pharma first-quarter reports by visiting IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News page.Wall Street was likely looking for strong sales of immuno-oncology drug Keytruda, which rivals Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Opdivo. Keytruda grew 134% to $584 million, Merck said. That lagged Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez's view for $600 million. Bristol's Opdivo sales grew 60% year-over-year in the first quarter.Sales of Januvia, a diabetes drug, fell 5% year over year to $1.34 billion and missed Fernandez's model for $1.38 billion. But that was offset by outperformance from human papillomavirus drug Gardasil and hepatitis C drug Zepatier, which beat estimates by $82 million and $78 million.Meanwhile, rival Dow drug stock Pfizer (PFE) reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings. But Pfizer sales fell short.RELATED:Bristol-Myers Beats Gilead, Merck To Key Approvals In China, EuropeCould Dow Stock Merck Undercut AstraZeneca In Lung Cancer?

209,PFE,"X The stock market traded mixed in afternoon trade — ranging from minor gains on the Nasdasq to light losses on the S&P 500 — heading into the final hour of the session. The tech-heavy composite moved up 0.2%, while the S&P 500 declined 0.2%.The Dow Jones industrial average inched lower. Volume was tracking slightly higher across both exchanges vs. the same time Monday. Among the other Dow industrials, IBM (IBM) paced the advancers with a 1.2% rise, while Microsoft (MSFT) and Home Depot (HD) followed up with gains of 1.1% and 1.0%, respectively.On the downside, medical components UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Pfizer (PFE) pulled the Dow into the red, declining 2% and 1.9%, respectively.Among the S&P 500, two chip stocks were among the leaders on the day.

Qorvo surged past a 72.52 flat-base entry, but remains within proper buy range.The S&P 500's laggards were once again retail stocks as they drastically underperformed the general market. Apparel companies Under Armour (UAA) and Hanesbrands (HBI) pierced their 50-day lines, falling 4.2% and 3.2%, respectively, while Ralph Lauren (RL) and VF Corp (VFC) dropped over 2% each.Leading retailer Burlington Stores (BURL) gapped below its 50-day line early Tuesday, down 3.3%.

210,PFE,"Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) is too risky to acquire as Merck (MRK) and Roche (RHHBY) pile on the pressure in immuno-oncology medications, an analyst argued Wednesday as he downgraded Bristol stock to an underperform rating.On the stock market today, Bristol stock was down 1.6% to 55.06. BMO analyst Alex Arfaei attributed the recent move in Bristol stock to near 56 from near 45 in January to takeover speculation.But Pfizer (PFE), an oft-cited potential suitor for Bristol, seems unlikely to make a deal in the near-term, Arfaei said. On Tuesday, during Pfizer's first-quarter earnings call, Chief Executive Ian Read cited macro issues that would make an acquisition difficult.""Pfizer has been, and I expect will continue to be, active industry consolidators,"" he said. ""However, there is a lack of clarity on potential tax reform, health care policies of the U.S. and uncertainties in the European markets with both the French election and the UK snap election.""Arfaei called for increasing uncertainty in Bristol's immuno-oncology franchise this year.Merck's immuno-oncology drug Keytruda will likely get the Food and Drug Administration's approval in combination with chemotherapy to treat advanced lung cancer and, also later this month, Merck is likely to unveil strong data for Keytruda plus Incyte's (INCY) epacadostat in a number of tumors.""We don't expect significant new data from Bristol at (American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting), and the conference itself will likely strengthen our argument that the (immuno-oncology) market will become increasingly fragmented,"" he wrote in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Bristol and Merck are leading the immuno-oncology market. But their days in the sun could be coming to an end. A number of companies are stepping up their immuno-oncology research and offerings. Head to IBD's Technology page for a look at who might rival these two over the coming years.In the latter half of 2017, Arfaei sees Roche's immuno-oncology drug Tecentriq pressuring Bristol in advanced lung cancer. He also expects payers to use data from Bristol to limit the use of its immuno-oncology drugs, Opdivo plus Yervoy, in melanoma.The immuno-oncology battle has pitted Bristol and Merck most directly. Opdivo and Keytruda are both what's known as PD-1 antibodies. They work to block the interaction between an immune system cell and a cancer cell hiding behind a PD-1 protein to help the body identify the cancer.But Bristol has had some wins in the immuno-oncology world recently. Last week, European regulators approved Opdivo as a second-line treatment for squamous cell head-and-neck cancer after platinum-based therapy. The company beat Merck to the approval.Still, Arfaei says Bristol is too reliant on its immuno-oncology drugs which, he estimates, will comprise 50% of sales and 70% of profits by 2021.""Overall, we argue that even if we see positive resolution of the macro factors, given Bristol's overdependence on its (immuno-oncology) franchise and our expectations for increased uncertainty about its potential, a takeout seems unlikely because it is simply too risky,"" Arfaei wrote.RELATED:Did Gilead Just Provide Some 'Incyte' Into A Potential Deal?Bristol-Myers Beats Gilead, Merck To Key Approvals In China, EuropeDow's Merck Tops Views And Raises Outlook, But Key Drug Lags

211,PFE,"Dow component Pfizer (PFE) on Tuesday reported mixed first-quarter results as what it calls its Essential Health unit tugged down overall sales, though revenue from a Novartis (NVS)-rivaling cancer drug bounded 58% vs. the year-earlier quarter.Pfizer said it earned adjusted income of 69 cents a share on revenue of $12.78 billion for the first quarter, up 3% and down 2%, respectively. Analysts had expected the No. 2 drugmaker to report earnings of 67 cents a share on sales of $13.09 billion.During the quarter, Pfizer's Innovative Health unit, which includes its newer products, grew 6%. But its Essential Health business, which includes legacy products, offset that, falling 9%. In September, Pfizer scrapped the idea of a corporate breakup that would have split the two businesses.Wall Street has pinned some hopes on Pfizer's Ibrance, which is approved to treat some forms of advanced breast cancer. Ibrance sales grew 58% to $679 million in the period. But it has some competition from Novartis' Kisqali. Further, Eli Lilly's (LLY) abemaciclib has shown promise in clinical trials.Sales of pneumonia vaccine Prevnar 13 toppled 8% vs. the year-earlier quarter. In the U.S., the dip was ""primarily due to the continued decline in revenues from the adult indication due to smaller remaining 'catch-up opportunity,'"" Pfizer said. Globally, sales fell on the timing of government purchases.Enbrel, an immunosuppressant, also saw sales dip. Outside the U.S. and Canada, Enbrel sales came in at $588 million, down 20%. In developed Europe, Enbrel sales fell 28% to $348 million. Revenue also toppled 6% and 3% in emerging markets and other developed parts of the globe, respectively.IBD'S TAKE: Having trouble keeping up with the slew of pharma and biotech earnings this quarter? Catch up on IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News page.Pfizer also reiterated its 2017 guidance for $52 billion to $54 billion in revenue and adjusted earnings of $2.50-$2.60 a share, flat and up 6.3%, respectively. Analysts are calling for $53.15 billion in revenue and adjusted income of $2.55 per share.On the stock market today, shares for the member of the Dow Jones industrial average dipped 0.5% to 33.61 after earlier falling as much as 2.7%, touching their lowest point in three months. The stock has a potential buy point at 34.75 out of a cup-with-handle that began forming in August.Meanwhile, fellow Dow drug giant Merck (MRK) also issues its first-quarter earnings report. Merck topped on earnings and sales, while raising full-year guidance.

214,PFE,"Eli Lilly (LLY) stock dipped early Tuesday though the drugmaker topped Wall Street's first-quarter sales and profits expectations.Baricitinib, Lilly and Incyte's (INCY) rheumatoid arthritis drug, needs more clinical data before the FDA will bless it. But, on Monday, Lilly said its breast cancer drug abemaciclib, rivaling that of Pfizer (PFE) and Novartis (NVS), met its goals at an interim analysis.The breast cancer win gave Lilly stock some confidence heading into its early Tuesday first-quarter earnings report. On the call, investors will likely look for commentary regarding plans for baricitinib, but also strong numbers for its diabetes and chemotherapy units.Among new drugs, Lilly's biggest are Trulicity, a diabetes drug, and Cyramza, a tumor drug. Trulicity sales launched 160% in the first quarter to $372.9 million with Cyramza up 31% to $171.2 million. Lilly saw major outperformance from Basaglar, a diabetes drug, which saw sales grow 321%.IBD'S TAKE: Lilly stock has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 43, meaning it underperforms more than half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. A better stock bet is Jazz Pharmaceuticals with a CR of 83 out of a best-possible 99. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the top five-rated drugmakers.Consensus: The consensus expected Lilly to report 96 cents adjusted profits on $5.22 billion in sales. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted earnings per share would be up 15.7%. Sales would grow 7.2%.Results: Lilly reported $5.228 billion in sales and 98 cents adjusted EPS, up 7% and 18%, respectively.Guidance: The company reaffirmed its 2017 adjusted EPS guidance for $4.05-$4.15.Stock Action: Lilly stock fell 2.7 to close at 81.20 on the stock market today after announcing its first-quarter results.

215,PFE,"Eli Lilly (LLY) stock popped Monday after the drugmaker said its breast cancer drug ""has the potential to be best in class,"" potentially sparking a deeper rivalry with Pfizer (PFE) and Novartis (NVS).Lilly stock finished 1.9% higher at 83.42 on the stock market today. The stock touched its 50-day moving average for the first time in five trading days. IBD's 43-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group jumped nearly 1%.The drug, abemaciclib, improved progression-free survival and overall survival when combined with an aromatase inhibitor — another type of breast cancer treatment — by its interim analysis.

216,PFE,"Pfizer (PFE) on Wednesday followed Baxter (BAX) in receiving Department of Justice subpoenas over a widespread antitrust investigation into the sale and marketing of saline fluids amid a shortage more than three years ago.Late Wednesday, Pfizer stock was down less than 1%, near 33.60, following reports of the DOJ probe. According to Reuters, Pfizer confirmed it received grand jury subpoenas from the department's antitrust division.The news comes just two days after Baxter stock fell less than 1% on news it had received subpoenas in what's expected to be part of the same investigation. In 2013-14, as the flu season raged, companies that make intravenous fluids to hydrate patients experienced delays in production.Amid the delayed saline solutions, prices rose 200% to 300%, according to four senators who asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the matter. Included in the probe were Baxter, Hospira — since acquired by Pfizer — and B. Braun.IBD'S TAKE: Pfizer stock has a low IBD Composite Rating of 31, meaning it underperforms more than two-thirds of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics like earnings power and sales growth. Visit IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the top five-rated drugmakers, including Jazz Pharmaceuticals, whose stock has a CR of 86 out of a best-possible 99.Baxter has called the allegation ""extraordinary"" in its motion to dismiss a related class-action lawsuit. To deal with the shortage, Baxter began importing IV fluids from its facility in Spain, incurring about $150 million in costs as it worked to comply with FDA requirements.Pfizer didn't immediately return a request for comment from Investor's Business Daily.RELATED:Did Baxter 'Hoodwink' FDA Inspectors Or Is Probe Just 'Extraordinary'?

The tech-heavy composite index remained down about 0.1%, well off its early lows. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average both lagged with losses of less than 0.2%.Volume soared on the NYSE, but fell slightly on the Nasdaq vs. the same time Friday.Among the Dow industrials in the stock market today, Goldman Sachs (GS) heavily weighed on the Dow 30 with a 1.8% loss. Other laggards include General Electric (GE), which fell 1.2%.On the upside, DuPont (DD) and Pfizer (PFE) tacked on 0.9% and 0.6%, respectively.Financials were among the biggest laggards in early trading. Global investment bank, Morgan Stanley (MS), dropped over 3%, while online broker, Charles Schwab (SCHW), declined 2%. Recent IPO, Snap (SNAP) continued its rise from its post-IPO lows, rising almost 5% after the social media company received multiple bullish ratings from analysts.Jefferies gave Snap a price target of 30 saying, ""We believe Snap has all the ingredients to build a robust advertising business."" Goldman Sachs set a 27 price target, while Morgan Stanley set theirs to 28.Snap went public at 17 a share on March 2.Apple (AAPL) saw its own price target hiked on Monday as JPMorgan (JPM) added the iPhonemaker to its ""Focus List.""

219,PFE,"Stocks are showing an impressive rebound after Monday's opening sell-off, with the Nasdaq composite turning a near 1% loss into a 0.2% gain.The Nasdaq 100, reflecting resilience in large- and megacap techs, rose 0.2%. The Dow Jones industrial average is turning a drop of nearly 1% into a loss of just 0.2% after falling more than 1% last week.Early Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average briefly clipped its 50-day moving average for the first time since it fell to the south side of the key support and resistance line Sept. 9. Back then, it took nearly two months for the 30-stock Dow to rebound back above the 50-day line.Helping the Dow were DuPont (DD), which was the sole component to rise 1 point or more. At 80.66, the diversified manufacturer is a legitimate leader in the stock market today, up 9.9% since Jan. 1. Shares also are up by 13% from a recent breakout on Nov. 30, past a 71.19 flat-base buy point.The S&P 500 was down less than 0.2%.IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards: View The Winners By CategoryAmong new issues, Snap (SNAP) is getting plenty of attention on the back of positive comments from analysts and new buy ratings. Shares strode more than 6% higher to 24.18, possibly setting up its highest close in more than two weeks.On its market debut, the Snapchat social media site operator leapt past its 17-per-share IPO to finish at 24.48, then catapulted another 20% to as high as 29.44 before coming down to earth. Over the next 10 sessions, Snap slid 36% to a low of 18.90. In a normal cup or double-bottom base, the decline usually runs no more than 33% to 35% from high to low — based on IBD's research of big winners over the past 22 bull- and bear-market cycles. So, in Snap's case, the decline is on the heavy side, especially given the fact that the gain from the 17-per-share IPO did not exceed 100% or more.Despite recent positive Wall Street comments, Snap is on course to lose money in 2017 (consensus estimate of a net loss of 45 cents a share) and 2018 (-$0.32).Still, the stock deserves a close watch if the rebound continues and the stock gets to within 5% to 15% of its 29.44 peak.In most excellent cup-with-handle patterns, a stock tends to form the handle — the last final shakeout of uncommitted holders before a big breakout to new highs — while trading no more than 15% off its 52-week or all-time high.While the Trump-supported American Health Care Act never saw the light of day Friday, investors should continue to watch leading names in the medical and health care services industry groups. Celgene (CELG), Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) were among the day's biggest point-winners.Celgene ranks No. 1 in the Big Cap 20; see the whole list in the latest IBD Weekly on page B19.The failure of the American Health Care Act, and future changes in former President Obama's Affordable Care Act, are unlikely to suppress demand for superior medicines to treat patients with deadly diseases such as multiple myeloma. Celgene is No. 1 in that field, and also is becoming a force in the treatment of chronic illnesses such as psoriasis.Celgene gets a wonderful 98 EPS Rating from IBD Stock Checkup due to its consistent pattern of long-term profit increases and solid gains in the short term as well. Over the past six quarters, earnings per share rose 27%, 17%, 23%, 17%, 28% and 36% vs. year-ago levels. That's an average EPS gain of 24.7%, which is outstanding for companies with market caps of $15 billion or higher.Celgene has a $96 billion market value and 775 million shares outstanding, which is large but not excessively so. As a point of comparison, Pfizer (PFE) has 5.95 billion shares outstanding.The Street sees fiscal year 2017 profit rising 22%, to $7.22 a share, on an 18% lift in revenue to $13.29 billion. Revenue rose 24%, 27% and 26% vs. year-ago levels in the prior three years.Intuitive, meanwhile, remains top of the hill in the field of robotic surgery systems. Wall Street sees earnings rising 12% to $4.93 a share in the current quarter, which would accelerate the 3% increase seen in Q4 2016.Sales are seen rising 13% to $670.2 million in Q1, up from 12% growth in Q4.Intuitive presented two buy points in 2017 so far. On Feb. 21, the stock spurted past a 72.35 cup-base entry in volume expanding nearly 40% above its 50-day average,  a sign of healthy demand by mutual funds, large investment advisers, pensions, insurers and the like. But go to a daily chart, and you'll also see a very narrow handle that formed from Jan. 26 to Feb. 1, creating a hard-to-see 700.52 early buy point.Add 10 cents to the highest price within any handle to obtain a handle entry point. Notice on a daily chart how the stock gapped up in huge volume on Jan. 25 in reaction to decent fourth-quarter results (EPS up 3%, revenue up 12%).Intuitive currently gets a solid 93 Composite Rating, better than Regeneron's 80 score. Watch to see if Regeneron musters the strength to rise back above the 50-day and 200-day lines, create some space above those key resistance lines, and earnest start forming the right side of a new base pattern.RELATED:How To Invest: Add The 10-Week-Line Pullback To Your Trading PlaybookHow To Invest: The Keys To A Great Cup-With-Handle BaseStock Market Today: Do These 7 Leading Chipmakers Deserve A Spot On Your Watch List?Inside IBD 50: What Do These 5 Big Winners Have In Common?Tech News At IBD: Why Snap Is Getting Some Love On Wall Street

220,PFE,"Sanofi (SNY) makes sense as an acquirer for Flexion Therapeutics (FLXN), an analyst said Friday on rumors that Flexion accepted a $1 billion offer from the French drugmaker — though Flexion investors were dubious.Flexion stock, which jumped 33% Thursday, tumbled as much as 3.3% on the stock market today, then rallied as much as 4.8%, before closing up 3.9% at 27.27. Sanofi stock edged up 0.3% to 44.63.RBC analyst Randal Stanicky sees Flexion as 40% likely to be taken out, he wrote in a research report. Sanofi makes sense given it sells Synvisc, an injection that supplements the fluid in a patient's knee to relieve osteoarthritis.Flexion is now working through the FDA approval process for Zilretta, a joint injection with an extended release formulation steroid for knee pain. Stanicky sees Zilretta as well positioned to take meaningful share from the existing steroid and hyaluronic acid markets.""Pre (FDA)-approval timing would allow Flexion to avoid sales force ramp (about 100 reps) and for Sanofi to allow it to participation in launch activities which, per Flexion, is expected to be $500,"" he wrote. The market is about 5.2 million people in the U.S. and worth $3 billion in size at branding marketing.Cantor analyst Chiara Russo sees Flexion as capable of launching Zilretta without help and says the rumored ""mid-30s"" per share takeover price — according to an unidentified source commenting to FiercePharma — is too low.""With significant changes in the competitive landscape over the past year giving Zilretta the sole new voice in the space, we see a mid-30s price as being a little low for a strategic buyer,"" Russo wrote in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Flexion has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 58, meaning it underperforms more than four in 10 of all stocks. A better biotech bet would be Celgene with a best-possible CR of 99. Visit the Stock Checkup for a list of the strongest leaders.Russo maintained a 34 price target and maintain rating on Flexion stock. She expects Zilretta to take significant market share.RBC's Stanicky sees a $37-$38 per share takeover price as reasonable but notes ""we see support for a deal north of $35 and perhaps closer to $50."" Though, he added, specialty valuations have come down recently and the deal is pre-Zilretta approval.He has an outperform rating and 44 price target on Flexion stock.The rumored bid comes just three months after Sanofi lost out on a contentious battle for Swiss biotech Actelion. Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) scooped that deal. Before that, another member of the Dow Jones industrial average, Pfizer (PFE), beat out Sanofi to acquire Medivation.Sanofi has also been rumored to have considered deals with BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) and The Medicines Company (MDCO) in the aftermath of a judge's ban on its cholesterol drug, Praluent, with Regeneron (REGN). The ban has been stayed pending an appeal in the case against Amgen (AMGN).Both Flexion and Sanofi declined to comment to IBD.RELATED:Did Sanofi Just Bag This Biotech For $1 Billion?Johnson & Johnson In Exclusive Talks To Acquire Actelion After Sanofi FrayCould Sanofi Acquire BioMarin In Wake Of Amgen LDL Brouhaha?

221,PFE,"XNo. 2 drugmaker Pfizer (PFE) is angling to take on biotechs Celgene (CELG), Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Kite Pharma (KITE) with a treatment for a type of leukemia in partnership with French pharmaceutical Servier.On Thursday, Servier announced the FDA had granted its application with Pfizer to begin developing a drug known as UCART19, a treatment for the blood cancer known as acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Acute lymphoblastic lymphoma causes certain white blood cells to be overproduced in the bone marrow, inhibiting the production and spread of normal red and white blood cells, according to EMedicine.com. The disease largely inflicts children.Pfizer and Servier's UCART19 belongs to a class of drugs that help the immune system identify a specific protein on cancer cells, thus allowing the immune system to destroy the cancer. The engineered immune-system cells are grown in a lab and then infused in a patient.IBD'S TAKE: Celgene could be nearing a breakout on its breakthrough technologies. Head to IBD Stock Analysis for a breakdown of the company's strong growth.Last week, Juno was forced to end its trial to treat the disease. Juno has plans to test a new drug next year in a partnership with Celgene. Meanwhile, Kite is testing a drug known as KTE-C19 in the same disease.In late trading on the stock market today, Pfizer stock was up a fraction, near 34. Kite stock lifted 6%, near 80.50, after announcing on Wednesday a public offering of common stock at 75 a share. Juno stock was up 2.4%, near 22.50, helping prompt a 1.8% jump in Celgene stock, which was above 125.RELATED:Celgene May 'Unveil' Breakthrough Treatment - And Breakout MoveJuno Tanks On Ended Leukemia Trial; Rival Kite Topples On Downgrade

222,PFE,"Regeneron (REGN) expects to top No. 1 biotech Amgen's (AMGN) cholesterol drug with its own medication in reducing the risk of heart attack, stroke and angina — and it's getting a vote of support from some unexpected corners.Regeneron is teaming up with Sanofi (SNY), and their upcoming study results on the drug Praluent hope to blow Amgen's Repatha out of the water. Repatha disappointed in its own recent heart-drug testing.What's unusual is that rivals from The Medicines Company (MDCO) and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) agree Regeneron and Sanofi have a better chance of succeeding. The reason is Regeneron and Sanofi tests are lasting much longer.""This suggests that the apparent effect size and the magnitude of the risk reduction could be greater in Regeneron's study,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a recent note to clients. ""Regeneron will achieve their results later, but appears to have high confidence in their likely result.""At Leerink's recent Biotech Mountain Meeting in Snowbird, Utah, representatives of Regeneron, The Medicines Company and Alnylam delved into the impact of Amgen's recent Fourier study on the cholesterol and statin space.Panelists agreed Regeneron and Sanofi's Odyssey Outcomes trial enrolled a higher-risk patient population likely to experience more events over the three- to four-year trial vs. Amgen's 2.2-year trial, Porges said.Regeneron and Sanofi are looking at Praluent's effect on reducing the risk of heart attack, stroke and unstable angina requiring hospitalization in patients age 40 and above with elevated ""bad"" LDL cholesterol and an acute coronary syndrome event in the last year.All panelists agreed, though, that Amgen's recent Fourier study should help in getting payers to reimburse patients for the costs of cholesterol drugs in what is known as the PCSK9 inhibitor class. These drugs work to reduce ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in the blood.Releasing its long-anticipated Fourier results late last week, Amgen said it showed reducing harmful LDL cholesterol cut the risk of heart attack by 27%, stroke by 21% and coronary revascularization by 22% in the first year. In the second year, the drug cut the risk of heart attacks and strokes by 33%.IBD'S TAKE: Among biotechs, Celgene had a strong week last week, breaking out after unveiling strong results for a trial of Otezla in patient with moderate plaque psoriasis. Head to IBD Stock Analysis for the deep dive.But Amgen said its drug, Repatha, didn't make a difference in reducing the risk of cardiovascular death. That caused shares of Amgen, Regeneron, Sanofi, The Medicines Company, Esperion (ESPR) and Pfizer (PFE) — all of which work on cholesterol drugs — to fall sharply.""Amgen's gambit meant that they delivered their outcomes trial result earlier than their competitor, but also undermined the effect of their treatment intervention, which was materially greater in the second year of exposure than the first,"" Porges said.Regeneron should have ""an even more robust effect size"" based on the length of its trial. It expects to have data in December, which likely would be presented in early 2018.Esperion and The Medicines Company recovered this week. Analysts note Esperion's drug, bempedoic acid, will likely be priced lower than Amgen's Repatha. Repatha goes for about $8,760 per year net price per patient in the U.S., Porges said.The Medicines Company also plans a cardiovascular outcomes trial for its drug, inclisiran, which is being developed with Alnylam. But Porges doesn't expect data in that trial until 2021 at the earliest.RELATED:Esperion And Medicines Company Recover From Amgen-Induced PitfallEsperion's Dive On Amgen Heart Study 'Counterintuitive' On PricingAmgen Tanks On Heart Study; Shares Of Other Drugmakers Tumble

223,PFE,"Bioverativ (BIVV) is not your standard biotech startup.For one, the drug developer is profitable. It also holds a wad of cash with no debt. And the maker of treatments for blood disorders is looking at the prospect of $1 billion in sales this year.Not bad for a company that's barely a month old. Waltham, Mass.-based Bioverativ, spun off from pharmaceutical giant Biogen (BIIB) on Feb. 1, has $325 million in cash and no debt. The company began trading on the Nasdaq on Feb. 2, with the stock closing at 44.98 on the first day. The stock was off 2% Friday, standing at 52.51 in afternoon trades.""We have a vision to build a great rare disease company that is focused on blood disorders and has the potential to create significant value for shareholders,"" Bioverativ Chief Executive John Cox said recently.With its spinoff, Bioverativ inherited two hemophilia drugs that were launched by Biogen in 2014 — Eloctate for hemophilia A and Alprolix for hemophilia B. Hemophilia A is considered to be the more serious strain of the rare genetic disorder that impairs the ability of a person's blood to clot due to reduced levels of a certain protein.The World Federation of Hemophilia estimates there were 187,000 people with hemophilia worldwide in 2015, of which about 18,500 are in the U.S. That's up from 172,000 in 2014, and about 80% of those patients have hemophilia A. Bioverativ, however, estimates the hemophiliac population is much larger, at about 400,000.Hemophilia is usually diagnosed at birth or at a very young age, and predominantly affects males. It can lead to recurrent and extended bleeding episodes that can cause pain, joint damage and life-threatening hemorrhages.According to Bioverativ, therapies for hemophilia topped $10 billion in 2016, a figure that is growing about 7% a year. But the market for such drugs is fragmented. Shire (SHPG) has one-third of the market share, while Novo Nordisk (NVO), Bayer (BAYRY), Pfizer (PFE), CSL and Bioverativ each have 10% to 15%.""We are aware of a number of companies, including large biopharmaceutical companies, such as Bayer, Pfizer, CSL, Roche Holding (RHHBY) and Shire that currently market or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of hemophilia,"" Bioverativ said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the spinoff.With a strong presence in North America and Japan, Bioverativ has generated and expects to continue to generate positive cash flows from operations since the third quarter of 2015. The company says that cash should ""allow us to further invest in our marketed products and pipeline, and to pursue strategic opportunities to enhance growth.""For the nine-month period ended Sept. 30, Bioverativ reported revenue of $631.2 million, up 63% from the same period a year ago, with net income of $148 million. Bioverativ revenue is expected to top $1 billion this year. In the third quarter, revenue rose 43% to $229.2 million. Adjusted earnings came in at 75 cents a share, up 60%.Raymond James analyst Christopher Raymond initiated coverage on Bioverativ with a strong buy rating and price target of 59. In a research report Raymond said he expects Bioverativ to grow at a 10% compound annual growth rate, with revenue reaching $1.48 billion by 2021.""And while other competitors will likely emerge, we think the portfolio is well positioned,"" Raymond wrote. ""We believe Bioverativ shares offer a unique mix of newly launching assets, a diverse development pipeline, and a strong balance sheet, all of which leaves it well positioned in this competitive area.""A less enthusiastic report came from Morgan Stanley analyst Mathew Harrison, who initiated coverage on Bioverativ with an underweight rating and price target of 41, saying Bioverativ faces key risks from competition and the potential to be leapfrogged by newer therapies given its very early stage pipeline.""We believe Bioverativ revenues are sustainable, but will face a slowing growth profile, flattening by 2020,"" Harrison wrote.One key advantage held by Bioverativ is that its two drugs last longer and thus require fewer dosages than competing products. But in the next one to three years, ""two potential game-changing products which can be dosed at monthly or greater intervals (vs. weekly for Bioverativ) from Roche and Alnylam could come to market,"" wrote Harrison.Stifel Nicolaus analyst Thomas Shrader initiated Bioverativ with a buy rating and a price target of 54. Shrader views Eloctate and Alprolix as ""cash cows"" with strong growth prospects.IBD'S TAKE: Bioverativ has an IBD Composite Rating of 96, meaning it outranks 96% of the companies that are publicly traded. The company, however, isn't the highest rated in its group. For information on the top-ranked biotech, check here.Gabelli analyst Jing He initiated coverage on Bioverativ with a buy rating and price target of 58, saying it's the only pure-play hemophilia company and could be an attractive takeout target down the road.""Bioverativ is an attractive takeout target but there are no near-term buyers,"" wrote He. ""We anticipate that competitors such as Shire and Novo Nordisk would be interested in Bioverativ and could benefit from cost synergies. However, we do not expect a takeover in the near term.""One threat to Bioverativ would be the successful development of other new technologies, such as gene therapies, which if successfully developed and approved would compete with Eloctate or Alprolix""New therapies and technologies have the potential to transform the standard of care for hemophilia patients, and our products may be unable to compete successfully with such new therapies and technologies that may be developed and marketed by other companies,"" Bioverativ said of risk factors in its SEC filing.The new company is developing longer acting therapies that will enter clinical development this year. It will also accelerate the development of bispecific antibodies and hemophilia-related gene therapy programs. It plans to move to clinical studies with a therapy similar to the long-acting Eloctate drug. A second drug is in early-stage studies, aimed at offering a less frequent and more efficient and convenient dosing schedule, the company says.""In addition, we intend to leverage our expertise and early research work to pursue adjacent disease areas, including other blood disorders, such as sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia,"" Bioverativ said.Bioverativ has a co-development, commercialization and royalty bearing agreement with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum, or Sobi. Bioverativ holds rights to commercialize both agents in the U.S., Japan, Canada, and Australia. Sobi has commercialization rights in Europe, Russia, and countries in the Middle East and Northern Africa, and pays a royalty to Bioverativ based on net sales.RELATED:Biogen Sidesteps Q4, 2016 Sales Misses On Strong Ex-Hemophilia GuideLesser-Known Biotech Stock Tests Buy Zone; Cancer Trial Results 'Encouraging'Merck's Alzheimer's Drug Fails; Are Biogen, Roche, AstraZeneca Next?

224,PFE,"Stocks slipped into the red early Tuesday as oil prices reversed lower. The Nasdaq composite hit a new record high despite another solid gain from Apple (AAPL).The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite each fell 0.1%; the Dow Jones industrial average held a fractional loss. The small cap Russell 2000 lagged, down 0.4%. Volume was lower across the board in the stock market today vs. the same time Monday.Gold miners, hotel operators and telecom-related plays were among top gainers in early trade, while department stores, solar and airline stocks underperformed.Apple led the upside on the Dow with a near 1% gain to a new all-time high in rapid turnover. Shares are now in profit-taking range, more than 20% past a 118.12 cup-with-handle buy point. Apple launched several new products Tuesday including a red iPhone 7, lower-cost iPad and a short video-making app called Clips.Nike (NKE) reversed slightly lower ahead of its earnings report due after the close. Analysts expect the athletic shoe giant to report a 4% slip to 53 cents per share on 5% higher sales to $8.47 billion. That would mark its first year-over-year EPS decline since late 2012.Among other blue chips, drugmakers Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE) (PFE) were up about 0.5% each, but Goldman Sachs (GS) and Caterpillar (CAT) were down more than 0.5% apiece.Marriott International (MAR) gapped up and rose 2%, striking a new intraday high in big volume. The hotel operator announced three-year growth plans that include earnings of $5.25 to $5.80 a share and a 17% to 21% compound growth rate. Shares are near the top of a buy range from an 86.25 flat-base entry.Non-U.S.-based stocks led the IBD 50: France's Criteo (CRTO), and China's TAL Education (TAL) and Weibo (WB) scored gains north of 2% each.On the downside, Lennar (LEN) fell more than 1% in heavy trade after reporting fiscal Q1 earnings that declined year over year, but topped views. That snapped a multiyear streak of quarterly increases.

225,PFE,"House Republicans introduced their proposal for repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, with age-based tax credits at its centerpiece. The legislation would also eliminate the individual and employer mandates as well as expand health savings accounts.The legislation is the GOP's biggest effort yet to remake the health care system, one that could have an impact on a wide variety of industries, from health insurance to hospitals and drugmakers. But shares of companies such as UnitedHealth (UNH), Pfizer (PFE), and Tenet Healthcare (THC) seemed little changed late Monday. (UnitedHealth and Pfizer are both on the Dow Jones industrial average.)Republicans would offer tax credits that are based on age, not income-based as they are for the ObamaCare exchanges. But they would be phased out starting with individuals earning more than $75,000 and for households making over $150,000. There would be no credits for individuals earning more than $215,000.The legislation would keep the Medicaid expansion program running until 2020. As of Jan. 1, 2020, rolls would be frozen and Medicaid would be funded on a per capita basis vs. the fee-for-service model.Plan repeals ObamaCare taxes on upper-income earners, capital gains, insurance plans and medical device manufacturers. It would not tax employer-based coverage, as an earlier version had proposed. It does keep the ""Cadillac Tax"" on high-end insurance plans, but would delay implementing it until 2025.The legislation would keep the ban on denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. It would repeal the individual mandate to get insurance, but would charge those who don't keep continuous coverage a one-time renewal fee of up to 30% more. The plan would also eliminate the employer mandate to provide coverage.The GOP bill would expand the annual contribution limit on health savings accounts tied with high-deductible insurance plans to $6,550 for an individual or $13,100 for a family. Health Equity (HQY), a major pure-play HSA provider, rose 1.5% in late trading.The plan also would bar federal funding for Planned Parenthood. That provision could run afoul of some GOP senators.Republicans do not say how many people would likely add or lose coverage as a result of the plan. The Congressional Budget Office has not released any estimates on costs.The House Republican plan is currently in two bills, one from the Energy and Commerce Committee and one from the Ways and Means Committee.It's unclear if President Trump backs the legislation or whether the plan could win support in Congress, especially in the Senate.RELATED:How To Replace ObamaCare And Save Social Security

226,PFE,"Eli Lilly's (LLY) pipeline has the best ""bang-for-the-buck,"" one analyst said Wednesday in an R&D comparison pitting Lilly against rivals Pfizer (PFE), Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said Lilly is outperforming the pack, achieving the best balance in R&D investment while limiting external investments over the past five years. Bristol and Pfizer trail whereas Merck struggles on these metrics, he wrote.Still, drugmakers like Lilly have struggled to gain FDA approvals. Only 9%-22% of drugs from 2011 pharma pipelines have gained approval. By contrast, biotechnology companies AbbVie (ABBV) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) have been more successful with 36% and 40% conversion rates.Among the top drugmakers, Bristol-Myers and Lilly have had considerably more success with phase three drugs. Meanwhile, Pfizer has only converted 20% of its late-stage pipeline in 2011 to drugs sold on the market.Pfizer has the broadest pipeline in the group -- with 57 disclosed new drugs, Fernandez wrote. But it has struggled with fallen megamergers and R&D disruptions, limiting its scale on productivity. Merck is the lowest in the pharma universe with 30.IBD'S TAKE: American Funds recently upped its stake in Bristol-Myers Squibb stock. Who else received American Funds' vote of confidence? Find out at IBD's Mutual Funds page.In his analysis, Fernandez also looked at ""churn,"" the turnover of new drugs from 2011-15, and ""burn,"" the percentage of attrition of the 2011 portfolio by 2016. Bristol has the highest burn rate and lowest churn rate.""The company appears to be focusing more on internal assets/partnerships/early stage M&A over mid- to late-stage external agents,"" Fernandez wrote in a note. ""Conversely, Merck's churn rate is among the highest in the group.""Merck's ""high overall R&D expenses are driven in part by the large Cubist and Idenix deals, which have so far struggled to generate the sizable returns management had hoped (for), as well the company's extraordinary investment behind Keytruda,"" he wrote.Though Merck isn't alone in its struggles with partnerships and acquisitions. Among big drugmakers and biotechs, only Gilead's purchase of Pharmasset in 2011 appears to have succeeded, Fernandez wrote.Pharmasset began development on Sovaldi, the hepatitis C drug that rocketed Gilead's sales in 2014-15. But Gilead's hepatitis C franchise began faltering in 2016 amid the high cure rates of its trio of drugs, Sovaldi, Harvoni and Epclusa.At the closing bell on the stock market today, Lilly finished trading up 0.8% to 83.41. Bristol-Myers rose 1.4% to 57.12. Meanwhile, Merck slipped 0.2% to 65.80 while Pfizer also lost 0.2% to 33.91.RELATED:Gilead Hepatitis C Sales Plunge As Merck Swipes Share: AnalystAbbVie Stronger Bet Than Gilead, Amgen — At Least Until 2020: LeerinkMerck, Roche Gouge Bristol's I-O Share After Lung Cancer Approvals

227,PFE,"After an attempted rebound in early trading, the major indexes drifted back lower in the stock market today.The Nasdaq outperformed the other indexes, falling 0.1%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively.Volume was mixed, tracking slightly higher on the Nasdaq but lower on the NYSE vs. the same time Monday.Among the Dow industrials, stocks were mostly quiet. No stocks rose or fell more than 1%. Pfizer (PFE) dropped 1% as the medical industry once again came under fire from President Trump's Twitter feed, where he reiterated his desire to lower drug prices.Recent IPO Snap (SNAP) tumbled 11%. Tuesday's fall comes after yesterday's 12% decline. This week's slide illustrates why investors are encouraged to wait until the initial euphoria has settled and the stock at least builds an IPO base, a short consolidation, before considering a purchase.Nvidia (NVDA) looked to rebound Tuesday, rising 0.8%. The chipmaker rallied after briefly reaching a new three-month low on Monday.Among companies reporting earnings, Thor Industries (THO), the RV maker, dropped 7.7% despite exceeding earnings and revenue estimates. (Other estimates were higher than what Thor reported.) Shares were currently trading around the 50-day moving average, just below a 106.44 cup-with-handle buy point. Support at the 50-day would be critical at this juncture.CEO Bob Martin was optimistic about the longer-term trends within the RV industry. ""Growing demand from new consumers broadening out market has continued, with younger families increasingly buying more affordably priced travel trailers and smaller motor homes,"" he said.Momo (MOMO) reported upbeat earnings and guidance that sent shares soaring 12%. Momo's live video service continued to fuel the company's revenues.Leading growth stocks were mixed in early Tuesday trading, but a few losers' drops were significant.Besides the aforementioned Thor Industries, other laggards included Sterling Bancorp (STL) and First Republic Bank (FRC), which fell 2.6% and 1.6%, respectively.On the upside, Arista Networks (ANET) moved up 1.2%, while chip stocks rounded the remaining six of the top 10 performers.Monolithic Power (MPWR), Applied Materials (AMAT) and Broadcom (AVGO) moved up 1% apiece.Monolithic found support at its 50-day line on Monday and was approaching a 92.76 flat-base entry. Applied Materials continued its solid uptrend. Shares were approaching a 20% profit-taking level from a 31.17 cup entry. Broadcom traded near its all-time highs following its earnings beat last week.RELATED:Momo Earnings Jump, Shares Surge On Live Video ProspectsSnap Plunges As More Analysts Say 'Lottery' Stock A Bad BetThor Industries To Ramp Up Investment And Expansion After Q2 Tops

228,PFE,"General Electric (GE) CFO Jeffrey Bornstein said Wednesday that some industries ""will sit on their hands waiting"" and not invest unless lawmakers deliver promised changes to taxes and regulations and provide more clarity on health care policy.The warning comes as House Republicans' corporate tax revamp is running into opposition in Congress, as more GOP lawmakers balk at a proposed import tax that's seen as a key piece of the overhaul. President Trump has yet to unveil his own tax plan. And while Trump also wants to repeal and replace ObamaCare, some Republicans have turned squeamish about sweeping changes to the health law.At the Barclays Industrial Select conference in Miami, Bornstein said he is ""reasonably confident"" that the changes will get passed in 2017, but said investors could be ""very disappointed"" if they aren't.""If we don't get corporate tax reform across the goal line in 2017,  if we don't provide some visibility to where health care is going in 2017, and if we don't deliver on all the regulatory changes the administration has talked about in 2017, I think we could end up in a very difficult place,"" he said.On Tuesday, GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt — along with CEOs from Boeing (BA), United Technologies (UTX) and other industrial exporters, as well as drugmakers Celgene (CELG), Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE) — wrote a letter urging congressional support for the House's tax reform blueprint, which includes a border adjustment tax.A total of 16 companies signed the letter, but more than 100 companies (including Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Nike (NKE)) and dozens of trade groups have signed on to Americans for Affordable Products, a group created to oppose the import tax.GE shares fell 0.6% to 30.33 on the stock market today. Boeing shares were off 0.1%. United Tech rose 0.1%.Last month, as talk of repealing ObamaCare began ramping up, GE's Immelt also indicated that some customers could become more cautious.""If I took it by segment, the Affordable Care Act is getting the most attention in the media and by our customers,"" he said on a conference call after reporting mixed Q4 results. ""I think you could see some caution around the Affordable Care Act as you go forward. We haven't really seen that much. But that could happen.""Trump said at a rally in Florida over the weekend that a replacement plan for ObamaCare won't be coming for ""a couple of weeks."" He warned earlier that the process could last until next year.Meanwhile, markets are still waiting for the White House to detail its own tax proposals, as those from congressional Republicans take more flak.Last week, Trump told retail CEOs that a ""massive"" tax plan will come ""in the not-too-distant future."" That followed his remarks to airline CEOs in the prior week, when he vowed to announce something ""phenomenal in terms of tax"" in the coming weeks.RELATED: If Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May CollapseTrump Silent On Ex-Im Bank, Hints At 'Big' Boeing Super Hornet Order

230,PFE,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) stock toppled late Tuesday after the No. 3 biotech reported first-quarter sales and earnings that lagged Wall Street and said it had another quarter of declining revenue from its blockbuster hepatitis C drugs.Overall sales fell 17% year over year to $6.5 billion for the quarter ended March 31, missing views for $6.62 billion. Adjusted income of $2.23 a share lagged expectations for $2.28 a share and plunged 26% vs. this time last year.Revenue from hepatitis C drugs Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa toppled 65% year-over-year to $2.6 billion. Gilead blamed the decline in Harvoni and Sovaldi on lower sales across all major markets, partially offset by stronger sales of Epclusa. Epclusa launched in last summer in the U.S. and Europe.Hepatitis B and HIV drug sales, on the other hand, grew 14% vs. the year-earlier period on continued uptake of HIV medicines Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey. Other products, including drugs for blood pressure, chest pain and intravenous infusions, grew 7.6% to $536 million.During the quarter, HIV drug bictegravir showed positive results in a Phase 2 study, Gilead said. Gilead pledged earlier this year to put a massive effort behind bictegravir after sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi slowed in 2016 as the hepatitis C market in the U.S. and Europe matures.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's 425-company Biomed/Biotech industry group is now ranked No. 12 out of 197 groups tracked. But the market has been volatile for some stocks. Visit IBD's Technology page for a look at which stocks look strong in 2017.Other markets are still emerging, however. Last week, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) was the first company to receive approval from Chinese regulators for an oral hepatitis C drug. Gilead's hepatitis C drugs aren't yet approved in China where north of 10 million people suffer from the disease.Gilead maintained guidance for $22.5 billion to $24.5 billion in product sales, including $7.5 billion to $9 billion in hepatitis C drug revenue. Hepatitis C drug sales would decline 44% at the midpoint and be at their lowest point since 2014. Sales in that unit declined 22.5% in 2016 after growing 54% in 2015.Shares ended trading Tuesday up 0.7%, at 68.59. After hours on the stock market today, Gilead stock was down 2.3%, near 67. Earlier in the day, Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK) reported their first-quarter earnings. Pfizer topped profit expectations, but sales lagged.

231,PFE,"AbbVie (ABBV) will get some breathing room in rheumatoid arthritis after Eli Lilly (LLY) and Incyte's (INCY) drug was hit with delays by the Food and Drug Administration over the weekend, leaving Lilly to instead focus on a Pfizer (PFE)-rivaling breast cancer med.On Friday, the FDA asked for more dosing information for Lilly and Incyte's rheumatoid arthritis drug, baricitinib, causing what could be a lengthy delay in its release. So Lilly's breast cancer drug known as abemaciclib is now especially important for Lilly, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said.Abemaciclib could compete against Pfizer's Ibrance and Novartis' (NVS) Kisqali in the CDK4/6 inhibitor market. These drugs aim to inhibit a specific set of enzymes thought to be tied to breast cancer.""In our Lilly model, we are currently forecasting $1.5 billion global sales of abemaciclib by 2026 with the overall CDK4/6 market reaching more than $10 billion,"" Fernandez wrote in a note to clients.Fernandez said abemaciclib could be the next major catalyst for Lilly's stock. Phase 3 data on abemaciclib is expected in June.""We believe abemaciclib's ability to dose continuously together with a safe and manageable tolerability profile likely will make abemaciclib highly competitive with Novartis' Kisqali — and provide opportunities to differentiate from Pfizer's Ibrance on secondary efficacy measures like response rate,"" Fernandez said.The analyst kept his outperform rating and 91 price target on Lilly stock.Lilly shares toppled as much as 5.6% on the stock market today, closing down 4.1% to 82.38, below its 50-day ling and a 83.34 buy point. Incyte stock tumbled 10.5% to 126.07. The delay on baricitinib means it likely won't get FDA approval until 2018 and launch until 2019. That removes a near-term rival for AbbVie's Humira. It also puts Lilly/Incyte seven to eight years behind Pfizer's Xeljanz, and more in line with generic-like competition.Analysts expect the drug to be delayed at least a year, and shares of Lilly and Incyte toppled early Monday. Baricitinib already has been approved for use in Europe.While baricitinib is likely delayed, Fernandez expects $1.7 billion in peak U.S. sales when it is approved. And Lilly still benefits from sales in Europe where the drug has attained approval.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's 43-company Ethical-Drugmakers industry group has risen to No. 150 out of 197 groups tracked from No. 184 just four weeks ago. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the top-rated drugmakers.Other analysts agreed on the one-year delay for baricitinib, but were more cautious on Lilly's breast cancer drug. BMO analyst Alex Arfaei called abemaciclib ""the biggest remaining uncertainty for Lilly in 2017."" He sees the data as likely to disappoint.""We still have not seen much data that would indicate CDK4/6 inhibitors are meaningfully differentiated,"" he wrote in a report. ""Data from (the American Association for Cancer Research) 2017 suggests abemaciclib is not as selective as ribociclib (Kisqali) and Ibrance.""Arfaei cut his price target on Lilly stock to 71 from 73, though he maintained his forecast for 5% sales growth for Lilly in 2017 on its diabetes drugs Trulicity, Jardiance and Basaglar, and psoriasis drug Talz.These drugs ""should offset the decline of mature franchises,"" he wrote. ""However, from 2015-20, we forecast revenue compound annual growth rate of 4%, below Lilly's guidance of 5% partly because more conservative assumptions for the mature franchises.""RELATED:Eli Lilly, Incyte Stocks Break Key Levels After FDA Drug SetbackHow Biogen's Takeover Prospects Soured In Mere MonthsBiotechs Split: Axovant Rides CEO Swap, But Celgene Partner Dives

234,PFE,"CEOs of Dow stocks General Electric (GE), Boeing (BA) and 14 other big U.S. exporters are warning that unless Republicans embrace a controversial tax on imports, a once-in-a-generation chance at tax reform will fail and American workers would be the losers.""Our tax code penalizes American workers who make products or provide services sold abroad, while favoring their international competitors,"" the CEOs wrote in a letter to leaders of both parties in Congress.Among other companies whose CEOs co-signed the letter were Caterpillar (CAT), Dow Chemical (DOW), Raytheon (RTN), United Technologies (UTX), Oracle (ORCL) and some of the biggest drug and biotech companies: Celgene (CELG), Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE).Caterpillar, Merck, Pfizer and United Technologies also are members of the Dow Jones industrial average, in addition to General Electric and Boeing.The letter puts some of the largest U.S. companies squarely behind House Speaker Paul Ryan and other House GOP leaders, who argue that leveling the international playing field by cutting the U.S. corporate tax rate to 20% (or lower) will be impossible without their plan for a 20% tax on imports, which would raise $1 trillion over a decade.Yet the biggest surprise about the letter may be just how few companies signed it, while more than 100 companies, including Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT), Nike (NKE) and the American subsidiary of Toyota (TM), and dozens of trade groups have signed onto the Americans for Affordable Products, created to oppose the House border tax proposal. (Wal-Mart and Nike are also Dow industrials stocks.)Retail stocks were under pressure from early December, as prospects for a border tax were on the rise, but they've made a modest recovery lately as prospects faded. On Tuesday, perhaps helped more by Wal-Mart's positive earnings report as well-received Macy's (M) earnings than weighed down by a revved-up lobbying campaign for the tax, retail shares were on rise. Wal-Mart rose 3% to close at 71.45 on the stock market today, while Target added 0.6%.IBD'S TAKE: Supporters of the border tax plan say that the dollar would rise by 20% vs. other currencies, meaning that it wouldn't harm either corporate profits or consumers. But it does pose a risk to U.S. investors holding shares of companies like Alibaba or international ETFs.Under the House proposal for a border-adjusted tax, U.S. companies would pay a 20% tax rate on the full value of imported goods, while export revenue would be tax-free. The border tax would raise more than $1 trillion over a decade to offset the cost of lowering the 35% statutory tax rate to 20%, the conservative Tax Foundation has said.Without the border tax, the ability of Congress to reduce the U.S. corporate tax rate will be limited to ""incremental tweaks (that) will not level the playing field for American workers or dramatically reinvigorate economic growth,"" the CEO letter said.It's not clear precisely why so few companies came out in favor of the border tax. Although the proposal seems to be running into a buzz saw among Republicans in the Senate, it's possible that the letter wasn't widely circulated. However, Caroline Freund, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, has predicted that ""many more big lobbies will be against the BAT (border-adjusted tax) than in favor."" That's because the tax favors labor-intensive industries that export more than they import, with aerospace being a rare example.There's one nagging question about why companies such as GE and Boeing that are so dependent upon exports would back the border tax. Most trade experts who have looked at the tax have big doubts that it would comply with World Trade Organization rules, so it could lead the U.S. into a trade war. Given that uncertainty and the possible consequences, it's hard to understand why companies so dependent upon trade would support the border tax, yet that may partly explain why the list of supporters is so small.RELATED:If Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May Collapse GOP Border-Tax Plan Would Sock U.S. Tourism — Including Trump Hotels

235,PFE,"Pfizer (PFE) stock regained earlier losses Tuesday after the No. 2 drugmaker reported Q4 earnings that lagged Wall Street expectations, with quarterly and full-year revenue guidance in line, outplaying its continued declines in sales of an adult pneumonia drug.In the stock market today, Pfizer stock fell as much as 1.2% to 30.93, but ended the day rising 1.3% to 31.73. Shares are down 2.3% for the year on worries Trump will go after drug pricing. Trump reportedly reiterated that view Tuesday in a meeting with pharma execs.For Q4, Pfizer reported $13.6 billion in sales, down 3% vs. the year-earlier period but meeting the consensus view. Pfizer reported 47 cents earnings per share ex items, down 11% and missing views for 50 cents.The company guided to $52 billion to $54 billion in 2017 sales, which was a bit light at the midpoint. And the midpoint of EPS minus items guidance of $2.50 to $2.60 was a penny short of the consensus view for $2.56.Pfizer wrapped up 2016 with $52.8 billion in sales and $2.4o EPS minus items, up 8% and 9%, respectively. Sales were in line, but EPS lagged the consensus by a penny. Sales of its Prevnar vaccines plunged 24% in Q4 and 8% for the year.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said higher-than-expected operating costs dragged down the bottom lines for both Pfizer and Eli Lilly (LLY), which also reported a largely in-line Q4 early Tuesday. Pfizer saw its SG&A costs increase in its Innovative Health unit.IBD'S TAKE: Pfizer might be ranked second in terms of market cap, behind Roche, but the stock underperforms 68% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics with an IBD Composite Rating of just 32.

242,PFE,"When Peter Gassner launched Veeva Systems (VEEV) in 2007, he didn't expect to outstrip $500 million in revenue, watch its stock triple in a span of less than three years or expand its arsenal of products to 23 applications.Instead, Gassner was in ""survival mode.""""In the beginning you have nothing — you have no products, no customers, no people, nothing,"" said Gassner, a one-time alum of Salesforce.com (CRM). ""You have exactly zero. So, then you have to start hiring some people, you have to make a product and get your first customer.""He added: ""Grand plans are sort of interesting, but it doesn't mean anything until you can hire your first developer or get your first customer.""Today, Veeva provides the cloud backbone for the $1.7 trillion life sciences industry where it rivals the likes of Medidata Solutions (MDSO), and counts companies like Pfizer (PFE), Novartis (NVS), Amgen (AMGN) and Eli Lilly (LLY) among its customers.As drugmakers tackle the challenge of developing, testing and manufacturing lifesaving drugs, Veeva operates the cloud system in the background. Its dual roles include organizing doctor information for pharmaceutical reps and clinical trial data/graphs for companies.Gassner calls the latter point ""Veeva's second act."" In total, Veeva estimates its total addressable market at $7 billion, though Gassner expects its nascent third act could add another $1 billion onto that. After all, becoming bigger and better is exactly what companies like Alphabet (GOOGL), IBM (IBM) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) did, he said.""The important thing in a company is, if you want to keep it going, your second act should probably end up being as big or bigger than your first act,"" he told Investor's Business Daily. ""A company that can make its second act bigger than its first act has some long-term ability to reinvent itself.""Veeva launched 10 years ago with a single application to help pharmaceutical reps organize drug data to make stronger doctor pitches. Today, 60% of the globe's pharma sales reps use what's called Veeva CRM — customer relationship management — an iPad application.Getting drug company managers to buy in early on wasn't difficult, Gassner says.IBD'S TAKE: Veeva Systems stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it outperforms 97% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of strong software leaders.""I think the life sciences industry is more business-outcome oriented,"" he said. ""There's important things the CEOs focus on: 'Can I get my drug approved? Can I get it to market effectively before the patent expires?' If there's a tool, cloud or not cloud, that can help them, that's generally what they want.""Fast forward to 2017, Veeva CRM is part of the company's Commercial Cloud business. Commercial Cloud grew in fiscal 2017 on major CRM wins and amid expansions at top 20 pharmaceutical firms, Veeva said in its earnings news release. The business accounts for two-thirds of Veeva's sales, Gassner estimates.But it's Veeva's second act that really has Wall Street keyed up, he said.Veeva Vault was launched in 2011 with a single customer and the goal of organizing all content involved in clinical trials — documents, videos, images and data records. Vault represents about a third of Veeva's total sales and targets a $4 billion total-addressable market, Gassner said.He sees Vault as the reason for recent excitement around Veeva stock. Shares are up 29% since January and, on March 13, burst out of a cup-with-handle formation that began in November, topping a 45.95 buy point on a deeper Salesforce partnership. The stock is now more than 14% extended from that point.From a bottom of 17.11 in May 2014 — seven months after Veeva's IPO — to an all-time intraday high of 53.37 reached Friday, shares gained nearly 212%. Shares ultimately retreated by Friday's close, but were up again Monday, gaining 1.4% to close at 52.55.In 2011, Vault brought in under $10 million in sales, Gassner said. Today, Vault's annualized run rate is north of $220 million.As a whole, Veeva is aiming to top a $1 billion annualized run rate in 2020, and Veeva is already tracking ahead of that, says Cornelio Ash, analyst at William O'Neil & Co., an affiliate of Investor's Business Daily.Now, Vault is prepping for a potential third act by looking for opportunities outside life sciences — a first for Veeva. Gassner says Veeva could see an additional $1 billion opportunity in taking Vault to other manufacturing-heavy industries like chemicals and consumer packaging.O'Neil's Ash says success in that venture will be a ""game-changer"" for Veeva.""What that would be saying is they've got a lockdown on the steps,"" he told IBD. ""Then it just becomes, what door do they want to knock down? The potential is there. That's probably why (Veeva stock) continues to trade at a premium.""Gassner says Veeva will gain traction outside life sciences using the same method it employed in 2007 and 2011 when it launched its major Commercial Cloud and Vault divisions. Inside the company it's called ""the Veeva way.""The method worked in life sciences, after all. Veeva has an estimated 50%-60% of the CRM market. And though its sales in clinical trials and regulatory processes match Medidata's, that's 100% of Medidata's sales vs. a small — and growing — chunk of Veeva's.""Your brand becomes what you're good at,"" Gassner said. ""If we become good at delivering this value outside life sciences, then I think over time we'll become known for that.""To that end, Veeva is part of a collaboration that includes AstraZeneca (AZN), Allergan (AGN), Biogen (BIIB), Lilly, Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Pfizer and others called Align Biopharma. Align is aiming to iron out the technological standards for the life sciences world.Veeva could do the same in a sector outside of the life sciences, Ash said.""That's literally getting feedback from the horse's mouth of how they should develop the platform,"" he said. ""To me, to be successful outside that, they're going to need that same kind of feedback in other sectors.""RELATED:IBD 50 Company Breaks Out After Deepening Salesforce Tie-UpVeeva Helps The Medicine Go Down For Drug Giants

243,PFE,"George Soros took stakes in Facebook (FB) and Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS) in the fourth quarter, while Appaloosa cut its stake in Apple (AAPL), and both followed Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BKRB) in appearing to find a bargain in airlines. Here's a look at how some big investors managed their portfolios in the last quarter of last year.Soros Fund Management bought 353,686 shares in Facebook and bulked up its stake in Alphabet (GOOGL) by nearly 60% to 20,200 shares, according to a regulatory filing out late Tuesday. Soros also increased his T-Mobile (TMUS) stake to 685,700 shares.Soros bought 62,100 shares in Goldman Sachs. Dan Loeb's Third Point last week disclosed that it had scooped up shares of Goldman, Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Bank stocks have risen on greater expectations of lighter regulations, higher interest rates and greater volatility, which Goldman's trading desk could benefit from in particular.Soros also took a 40,000-share stake in Delta Air Lines (DAL), but dropped United Airlines (UAL).Shares of Apple ended regular trading up 0.4% to 135.51 on the stock market today, after hitting a record high yesterday. Facebook fell 0.3% to 133.44, while Goldman Sachs rose 0.4% to 250.54. Delta climbed 2.6% to 51.17, American rose 2.1% to 47.54, and United gained 2.7% to 75.75.IBD'S TAKE: Even as big investors flocked to the airlines last year, Cowen analysts last month said shares of airlines could be ""due for a break"" after taking off in Q4. Meanwhile, Soros dropped Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Herbalife (HLF), Harley Davidson (HOG), PepsiCo (PEP) and JCPenney (JCP). He also dissolved his stake in Nordstrom (JWN)Soros also offloaded his position in consumer-care products giant Procter & Gamble (PG), which got a lift Tuesday after activist investor Trian took a more than $3 billion stake in the company.Hedge fund Appaloosa Management increased its stake in Facebook by 47% to 2.2 million shares. The fund also upped its holdings in Qualcomm (QCOM) and more than doubled its stake in Southwest (LUV). Appaloosa also took a 160,000-share stake in United Airlines.The fund loaded up on the health sector, taking new stakes in companies like Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Centene (CNC), McKesson (MCK) and Pfizer (PFE). It also took a new stake in JCPenney.Appaloosa cut its position in Apple by 350,000 shares, slashed its stake in Yahoo (YHOO) and rid itself of Bank of America and General Motors (GM).Along with boosting its stake in Apple, David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital dissolved its stake in Take-Two Interactive (TTWO), U.S. Steel (X) and Michael Kors (KORS).Like Buffett, Greenlight also took a stake in Monsanto (MON).But the moves by Soros and Appaloosa into airlines are notable in that they could signal other big investors are following Buffett, who announced Q3 stakes in the sector last year.Buffett, after years of avoiding the airlines, has come around to the industry. Airlines last year showed more signs of discipline, and the wave of consolidation over the past several years has kept the major airlines relatively insulated from new competition.""When we launched on the sector late last year, we found most investors generally in agreement that airlines represented deep value,"" Barclays analyst Brandon Oglenski wrote in a research note dated Tuesday.""The biggest question remains: when will the market and, more importantly, large long-term investors begin to care? We think tonight's Berkshire Hathaway 13F will go a long way to attract sector interest.""RELATED:Airline Stocks Tumble On Fears Capacity May Creep Back UpDelta, American, United Go Guns Blazing Into Battle Of The AtlanticJPMorgan Sets Fresh High, Goldman Hits Highest Since 2007 On Yellen

244,PFE,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) needs Swiss biotech Actelion Pharmaceuticals to help reaccelerate earnings growth after its patent on blockbuster immunosuppressant Remicade expires in 2018, RBC analyst Glenn Novarro said Friday.The deal is a win-win. J&J's Remicade, which brought in 58% of its pharmaceutical sales in 2016, is facing competition from Pfizer's (PFE) biosimilar Inflectra. Meanwhile, Actelion has been prepping for the loss of exclusivity of its pulmonary arterial hypertension drug.In the first nine months of 2016, Actelion's U.S. sales increased 23% when accounting for exchange rates, Novarro said. At the same time, sales of PAH drug Tracleer fell by 23%, offset by sales of fellow PAH drugs Opsumit and Uptravi.""With generic completion to Tracleer in the U.S. imminent, we believe sales would be flat for Actelion in 2017,"" Novarro wrote in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: Johnson & Johnson had seven drugs approved 2012-16, tying with Pfizer. Head to IBD's Industry Themes to see which company had the most approvals over that period of time and in 2016, specifically.J&J early Thursday announced it had agreed to pay $280 per share of Actelion stock, valuing the company at $30 billion. The deal is expected to close in June and could help J&J tack on 8 cents earnings per share over six months. For 2018, Novarro sees the deal as 35 cents-accretive.He also expects Actelion sales to grow 7%-9% in 2017 on the J&J acquisition. That forecast could be conservative, he says, as J&J sees itself as having a big enough geographic footprint to help Actelion grow.Novarro has an outperform rating and 128 price target on Johnson & Johnson stock, which rose 1.4% to 113.38 on the stock market today, after falling 0.85% on Thursday. Shares have traded well below their 50-day moving average this week.RELATED:J&J CEO 'Underwhelmed' Investors After Trump Dodges Drug PricingJ&J Hep C Dips To 'Virtually Zero,' Mirroring Gilead; 2017 Views LagGilead, Merck, Alexion 2017 Views Hazy; Biogen May Surge: Analyst

245,PFE,"Pfizer's (PFE) Ibrance could grow to $8 billion to $9 billion in sales beyond 2023, but Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez says the No. 2 drugmaker will first have to overcome competition from Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novartis (NVS).Ibrance belongs to a class of drugs called CDK4 and CDK6 selective inhibitors. The Food and Drug Administration approved a combination of Ibrance and Femara (an aromatase inhibitor) in February 2015 as a treatment for estrogen receptor (ER) positive advanced breast cancer.But now Eli Lilly and Novartis are creeping in with abemaciclib and ribociclib, respectively. Abemaciclib was approved for ""Breakthrough Designation"" in 2015 and is amid several Phase 3 tests. Last year, the FDA granted ribociclib priority review for first-line advanced breast cancer.Prescription trends show Ibrance is slowing after a rapid uptake in the U.S. Fernandez lowered his yearly sales expectations by $800 million, but still sees Ibrance running up to $8 million to $9 million in global annual revenue after 2023.IBD'S TAKE: Pfizer had seven drugs approved in 2012-16. Who else curried favor over that time period? Head to IBD's Industry Themes for more.Fernandez, in a research report, kept his market perform rating and 36 price target on Pfizer stock. In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Pfizer rose 14 cents to 21.29. The company is set to report its Q4 earnings before the open Tuesday.Fourth-quarter sales and earnings were likely in line for Pfizer, Fernandez said. The consensus of 23 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expects Pfizer to report $13.64 billion in sales and 50 cents in EPS ex items, down a respective 2.9% and 5.7% vs. the year-earlier quarter.The $14 billion acquisition of Medivation, completed in September will add sales of prostate cancer drug Xtandi to Pfizer's top line, but that will mostly be offset by generic erosion of Lipitor and Pristiq, Fernandez said. Enbrel, a TNF inhibitor marketed by Amgen (AMGN) and Pfizer, is facing biosimilar pressure.In 2017, Fernandez expects Pfizer's overall sales to grow 2% vs. 2016.RELATED:Lilly Nears FDA Nod On Arthritis Drug, But Chemo Med Stuck In CourtAmgen Could Gouge 'Top Pick' AbbVie With Humira Biosimilar: JefferiesTrump's 'Disastrous' Pharma View Doesn't Rattle JPMorgan Drug Conference

246,PFE,"Axovant Sciences (AXON) and OncoMed Pharmaceuticals (OMED) diverged in IBD's 424-company biotech industry group Monday as Axovant stock rode its chief executive swap to a 16-month high and OncoMed stock toppled on a failed drug trial.By the closing bell, on the stock market today, Axovant stock popped 22.5%, to 18.54, after announcing that former Medivation CEO David Hung would succeed Vivek Ramaswamy at the top job at Axovant. Ramaswamy will move up to lead Axovant parent Roivant Sciences.Hung's appointment was effective Friday. He headed up Medivation until its $14 billion acquisition by Pfizer (PFE) in September 2016. Ramaswamy said in a news release that Axovant hadn't initially been looking for a new CEO.""I approached David about taking a role with us after the Mindset study,"" he said, adding that ""David decided he wanted to join us now."" The Mindset study looks at Axovant's drug intepirdine in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's patents; results are expected in September.Axovant stock busted out of a cup-with-handle formation that began in August 2016, passing a 15.90 entry point. Shares are now 24.8% extended from that buy point, touching a high last achieved in December 2015.Meanwhile, shares of OncoMed plunged to an all-time low after its drug, demcizumab, failed to extend progression-free survival in late-stage pancreatic cancer patients.OncoMed stock hit a record low, falling below 5 at one point during the session, and was down 36.6%, to 5.60, at the close.OncoMed's trial looked at a combination of demcizumab, gemcitabine and Abraxane. OncoMed also missed its second goal of improving overall survival. The trial compared demcizumab, gemcitabine — a chemotherapy first developed by Eli Lilly (LLY) — and Celgene (CELG) chemo Abraxane with gemcitabine and Abraxane plus a placebo.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's biotech industry group is ranked No. 4 out of 197 groups tracked, up from No. 56 just 13 weeks ago. Among biotechs, Celgene stock is the clear leader with an IBD Composite Rating of 99, out of a best-possible 99. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the top-five best-performing biotechs.Also Monday, Bayer Pharma (BAYRY) dropped out of a deal to license OncoMed's drugs vantictumab and ipafricept for strategic reasons, OncoMed said in a news release. Both drugs aim to treat solid tumors and proved safe and effective alone and in combination with chemo in early trials.""While we had looked forward to collaborating with the Bayer team on the late-stage development of these biotherapeutics, we are very pleased to have worldwide rights to two promising Phase 2-ready assets,"" CEO Paul Hastings said in a statement.RELATED:Axovant Confidence 'Not Swayed' After Rival Alzheimer's Drug Fails

248,PFE,"Baxter (BAX) stock fell Monday on worries related to a Department of Justice investigation into potential price fixing of intravenous fluids — allegations an analyst deemed ""extraordinary.""On the stock market today, Baxter stock fell 0.8% to 52.82 after the Justice Department sent a grand jury subpoena to one of Baxter's employees.The subpoena was received Friday and relates to a criminal investigation by the Justice Department's antitrust arm. It asks for documents and testimony related to manufacturing, pricing, selling and shortages of intravenous solutions, and Baxter's communications with rivals.Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar noted that the price-fixing allegation isn't new. It stems from a 2-year-old investigation that began in New York and an ongoing class-action suit in the Northern District of Illinois related to supply shortages.The shortage was triggered by the flu season in 2013-14 and benefited manufacturers like Hospira, which in the third quarter of 2014 saw 43% growth in its unit that produces intravenous fluids, Kumar said. Hospira was acquired by Pfizer (PFE) in 2015.But the class action lawsuit alleges that manufacturers of intravenous fluids falsely created the shortage to justify spiking prices in 2014. Baxter, which has filed for a motion to dismiss the suit, called the allegations extraordinary.""The idea of a public company voluntarily creating supply shortage in the hopes competitors would similarly restrict output in order to raise prices seems a stretch,"" Kumar told clients in a note.IBD'S TAKE: Baxter stock trades in IBD's 120-company Medical-Products industry group which is led by Medtronic (MDT), Stryker (SYK) and Boston Scientific (BSX) in terms of market cap. Medtronic, Boston and Edwards Lifesciences (EW) compete in the heart-valve replacement market. Check out this edition of Sector Leaders to see how they stack up.FDA regulators regularly inspect manufacturing facilities, he noted. The class action lawsuit seems to imply that Baxter and other intravenous-fluid manufacturers were able to ""hoodwink"" inspectors to post shortage notices, he said.Baxter said in 2015 that it incurred about $150 million in costs to comply with increased FDA regulatory requirements and meet supply constraints. Meanwhile, price increases only contributed $70 million to $90 million in 2016 growth, Kumar said.In 2016, intravenous-fluid solutions contributed two-thirds of that segment's growth, implying that pricing was up 6% on average, Kumar said. Assuming a bag of intravenous fluid costs $1.50 to $2, this equates to increases of 15 to 20 cents per bag.Apart from price collusion, prosecutors will have to argue whether Baxter's earnings on increased intravenous fluid prices were reasonable. Kumar estimates that after hiking prices on intravenous fluids Baxter had 15%-16% margins on its earnings before interest and taxes.RELATED:Boston Scientific Makes Acquisition To Battle Medtronic, EdwardsMedtronic, Edwards Among Five Best 'Stocks To Own': Analyst

249,PFE,"It was just a year ago that the formula seemed right for Biogen (BIIB), the fourth-largest company in its industry, to mix up a biotechnology megamerger.Biogen's multiple sclerosis franchise — a lineup of six drugs that includes Tecfidera and Tysabri — was growing. Tecfidera, Biogen's most important drug, brought in $3.97 billion in 2016, up 9%.Further, hemophilia sales, though small, grew 53% in 2016 to $847 million between just two brand-name drugs, Eloctate and Alprolix. And Spinraza, a spinal muscular atrophy drug, grabbed FDA approval just days before Christmas.The plot thickened when Biogen's chief executive, George Scangos, resigned in July, leaving the company susceptible to takeout by the likes of Merck (MRK), Allergan (AGN), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Pfizer (PFE). Takeout rumors abounded, and Biogen stock ended 2016 down 6.2%, making it a cheaper asset to buy.""I thought last year was really the time for it to happen,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said. ""What Biogen offered last year was a relatively stable MS business that was still growing, a robust cash flow scheme, the opportunity for Spinraza and the hemophilia franchise. So an acquirer could say, 'I get all of that.' ""Fast-forward to today, and the picture is entirely different. Biogen is seeing increasing competition in the MS market, payers are balking at Spinraza prices, and the company has already taken its hemophilia drugs out of the equation.Now, only 24% of Wall Street sees Biogen as a potential takeout candidate in 2017, according to a Mizuho survey. And Porges says Biogen will probably have to wait until 2020 to see the deals roll in, if ever.""I think it has become significantly less likely,"" Porges said.So, what happened?After an incredibly successful 2016 in multiple sclerosis — including the launch of Zinbryta with AbbVie (ABBV) — Biogen's MS unit is facing looming competition from the likes of Roche (RHHBY) and Celgene (CELG), Porges told Investor's Business Daily.In a note to clients on April 7, Porges called Roche's Ocrevus a ""game-changer."" Ocrevus was approved in late March to treat both relapsing-remitting and primary progressive forms of MS, separating itself from the pack that is only approved for the relapsing-remitting form.""Both the MS physician and patient communities have been eagerly awaiting the Ocrevus launch,"" Porges said. ""The drug's high efficacy, reasonable safety profile and convenient six-month dosing schedule are all major factors in the drug's positive reception.""That spells trouble for Biogen, as Tecfidera had comprised 40% of total product sales as well as 76% of the MS unit. Biogen is actually partnered with Roche on Ocrevus, but the royalty won't be enough to offset erosion to its own MS franchise, analysts say.Porges expects Ocrevus to get 60% of the primary progressive MS market within three to four years. In the relapsing-remitting MS market, Porges sees 40%-50% erosion of Tysabri, and 30%-40% erosion of Tecfidera and Novartis' (NVS) Gilenya sales.Meanwhile, Celgene is working on an MS drug called ozanimod in Phase 3 testing. In function, ozanimod is closest to Novartis' Gilenya, though it could also rival Tecfidera or Sanofi's (SNY) Aubagio. Tecfidera, Gilenya and Aubagio, respectively, lead the MS market in terms of sales.""If Celgene wanted to buy a sales force and have something overnight to help sell ozanimod, Biogen could be that company,"" Porges told IBD. But with Biogen likely to suffer erosion from Roche competition in MS, that's looking less probable.The silver lining? Biogen won a patent and an interference case against Forward Pharma (FWP) over Tecfidera, though it was out a $1.25 billion settlement fee. Forward stock toppled 22.5% on the decision as it now loses out on a major royalty.Biogen's Spinraza has a different set of troubles. Developed with Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS), Spinraza is the first and only drug approved for the rare neurological disorder that causes muscle weakness and wasting in infants and children.Wall Street largely thought of Spinraza as a slam dunk. It had ""profound efficacy"" in two August 2016 studies in infants and children. The drug was so effective that Biogen and Ionis ended the studies early, Ionis Chief Executive Stanley Crooke told IBD in December.Spinraza was approved Dec. 23 with a fairly broad label. It's approved for use in children and adults with spinal muscular atrophy and remains the only drug approved for the disease that Crooke called ""catastrophic.""""This drug, of all things, should be rapidly adopted and widely reimbursed,"" Porges said. ""And what may have happened was what appeared to be good fortune with the label may have turned into a liability because payers became concerned too many patients would start on the drug so they restricted access.""Mizuho analyst Salim Syed calls 2017 ""largely a Spinraza story."" Biogen is set to report its first-quarter earnings on April 25. That will be particularly telling following the launch of Spinraza earlier this year. Analysts say, though, that payers are pushing back hard on reimbursements of the drug.Insurers Anthem (ANTM) and Humana (HUM) are only reimbursing patients on Spinraza with the most severe form of the disease, Type 1. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) has a broader policy, covering Type 1, 2 and 3 patients. That could be because Spinraza costs $125,000 per treatment, or $750,000 in the first year, and $375,000 in subsequent years, making it a pricey drug.The consensus is projecting $15 million in first-quarter Spinraza sales, Syed said.Porges lowered his expectations for Spinraza for 2017 to $266 million from $400 million. Sales results for the first quarter will be especially telling, he told IBD. North of 100 patients on the drug would be ""pretty good — as long as they're seeing continued starts.""Then there's Biogen's hemophilia drug lineup.In February, Biogen spun off its hemophilia franchise into Bioverativ (BIVV). Since then, Bioverativ shares are up 27%, which is great — for Bioverativ. But any company considering a Biogen takeover might think again without that unit, Porges said.IBD'S TAKE: Bioverativ isn't your standard biotech startup. Head to The New America to find out why.Bioverativ has yet to announce any quarterly results, having only been public since early February. The company is set to release its first-quarter earnings results on May 3. In its last full quarter with Biogen, that hemophilia unit brought in $242 million, up 11.5% year over year.Now, Porges says it would be smart for Biogen to also spin off its multiple sclerosis unit and turn its focus toward Alzheimer's. In Alzheimer's Biogen is following Eli Lilly and Merck, both of which had notable failures in December and February.Biogen's Alzheimer's play is the strongest in the sector, analysts say.In March, RBC analyst Michael Yee told IBD that Pfizer and Merck are the likeliest players to make a bid on Biogen. They would be ""interested in more branded drugs and particularly the Alzheimer's pipeline.""Biogen is working on two classes of Alzheimer's drugs — one that works to remove plaque buildups in the brain associated with Alzheimer's and another called a BACE inhibitor with Eisai. BACE inhibitors aim to prevent the plaque buildup.Porges says Biogen will likely have to wait until 2020 to see renewed takeover interest. In 2020, Biogen is expected to release the results of two Phase 3 trials of aducanumab. Its BACE inhibitor, elenbecestat, is also in a Phase 3 trial with results expected after September 2020.Eli Lilly's solanezumab worked on the theory that it would remove plaque buildup — called beta amyloid — in the brain. Merck's verubecestat was a BACE inhibitor. But both failed, and there are only a handful of potential Alzheimer's drugs in development now.Meanwhile, Axovant Sciences (AXON) is working on a different theory of treatment that doesn't involve beta amyloid. It expects to have Phase 3 data of its drug, intepirdine, later this year. That, too, could change the Alzheimer's landscape and potentially further dent Biogen's chances of a merger.Still, Biogen's board will place a high premium on its Alzheimer's pipeline if it ever comes to the acquisition table, Porges said. That's because everything else has failed and development costs for aducanumab and elenbecestat have headed toward the billions of dollars, Porges said.""If you're willing to take the risk on Alzheimer's, it still makes some sense as an acquisition, but what I've heard from people in and around the industry is they're struggling to bridge the gap,"" he said. ""The board wants to be paid for Alzheimer's as if it's going to work.""RELATED:How Roche's 'Game Changer' Drug Will Chip Away At Biogen, NovartisBiogen Dives As Takeover Buzz Fades, Drugs Hit SnagsCan This Small-Cap Biotech Take On Gilead, Celgene, Biogen In Alzheimer's?

250,PFE,"Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi's (SNY) Dupixent grabbed FDA approval Tuesday and will be priced at $37,000 annually for patients with moderate to severe eczema, the companies said.Shares of Regeneron closed down 0.3% at 382.55 on the stock market today, after earlier falling as much as 1.9%. Sanofi stock dipped 0.1% to 45.35. The FDA approval removes ""pricing overhangs,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said after the news.Earlier in the day, Porges suggested that Regeneron and Sanofi could price Dupixent at $30,000 annually. He expected the FDA to approve Dupixent, allowing for ""recent manufacturing overhangs"" to be lifted. The approval means Dupixent could be available commercially as soon as next week, he said.Now he expects Regeneron and Sanofi's sarilumab, for rheumatoid arthritis, to grab FDA approval in the second quarter. Both Dupixent and sarilumab will be filled at Sanofi's French facility. Issues at that facility delayed sarilumab last year.Reactions to the announced price have been mixed, Porges said. But ""we expect the decision to result in significantly higher demand, faster than if the company had hewn to their traditional premium price strategy,"" he added.There are hundreds of thousands of eczema patients. In this setting, Porges says it's most important for Regeneron and Sanofi to ensure access and, at this price, payers will likely open access to most eczema patients. This price is also within earlier analysis that compared Dupixent prices with psoriasis treatments.On average, gross prices for comparable injectable psoriasis treatments run from $29,000-$50,000 per patient per year, Porges wrote in an earlier note to clients. He saw this as a good starting point for Dupixent and Pfizer's (PFE) Eucrisa.Leerink analysts also looked at the measure of disease burden on quality and quantity of life. Using that scale, analysts found patients with severe eczema were willing to pay $75,100 per year. Patients with moderate eczema were willing to pay $125,500.IBD'S TAKE: On Monday, Regeneron was among three medical stocks that gained big. See the other biggest point-winners on the Stock Market Today.""At both levels, the cost ... was below the usually accepted willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000,"" Porges said. ""Regardless of the price, the investigators found that Dupixent would be likely to improve health outcomes compared to usual and existing care, but would do so with additional cost.""Porges reiterated an outperform rating and 448 price target on Regeneron stock.RELATED:Regeneron, Sanofi Look To Crush Amgen, And Rivals Say They CanEsperion And Medicines Co.

252,PFE,"The FDA's approval of a multiple sclerosis drug from Roche (RHHBY) is likely to be bittersweet for Biogen (BIIB), analysts said Wednesday.While Biogen will get royalties on Ocrevus, the new drug will rival Biogen's own multiple sclerosis medications, Tysabri and Tecfidera.Ocrevus was approved Tuesday for both relapsing and primary progressive forms of multiple sclerosis. In addition to Biogen's drugs, Ocrevus will compete with Novartis' (NVS) Gilenya, Merck KGaA/Pfizer's (PFE) Rebif and Sanofi's (SNY) Aubagio and Lemtrada.Mizuho analyst Salim Syed called the label on Ocrevus ""clean."" Though the label does warn of the risk of a deadly brain infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, it clearly states there have been no observed cases of the infection in Ocrevus' clinical trials.Biogen will receive a 13.5%-24% royalty on U.S. sales and a 3% royalty on sales outside the U.S. But investors are bearish on its likely effect. In a February survey, 46% and 45% of investors believed Ocrevus would be a net negative or a wash for Biogen, Syed said.For Biogen, Ocrevus offers upside in the primary progressive multiple sclerosis market, as Biogen's drugs are approved only to treat the relapsing-remitting form of multiple sclerosis. Still, the primary progressive market is small, about 10%-15% of patients.""As the only approved medicine for primary progressive multiple sclerosis, Ocrevus could reach very significant market penetration quickly,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said. This ""would benefit Biogen through the royalty payment in the U.S.""IBD'S TAKE: Biogen spinoff, Bioverativ, says it's not a typical biotech startup. Why? Read on in The New America.Porges models $281 million in Ocrevus royalties to Biogen in 2020, growing to $448 million in 2025. He sees Ocrevus grabbing 20% share of the relapsing-remitting market and 45% of the primary progressive market.""Ocrevus has impressive, but not necessarily class-leading efficacy,"" he wrote in a report, noting Biogen's Tysabri and Sanofi's Lemtrada likely still lead in terms of effectiveness. But, unlike most multiple sclerosis drugs, Ocrevus is dosed once every six months via injection.""This offers remarkable convenience for patients, but also comes with some risks,"" he said. ""There were serious infections during the drug's clinical development, and in case of such complications, physicians are likely to find it difficult to reverse the drug's effect and restore immunity.""Roche notes in a news release, the most common side effects associated with Ocrevus in late-stage studies comparing it with Rebif were infusion reactions and upper respiratory tract infections, the latter of which were mostly mild to moderate in severity.Ocrevus will be priced at $65,000 per year, which is a 20% discount to other multiple sclerosis drug, on average, Mizuho's Syed wrote in a note to clients. Gilenya, Tecfidera and Aubagio cost $60,000, $55,000 and $45,000 annually.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Biogen stock fell 2% to 268.53.

253,PFE,"No. 2 drugmaker Pfizer (PFE) could boost its value by $5 billion in a takeover of Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), an analyst said Monday, acknowledging Bristol-specific and macro uncertainties limit the likelihood.Still, it's been a common question ""given some of the challenges Bristol-Myers Squibb is facing and the activist involvement in the name,"" Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan says. Questions of a takeout center on the next nine to 12 months, he said in a note to clients.""Pfizer commentary in our recent 'Meeting with Management' and at other investor conferences makes us think they are certainly looking at all possibilities when it comes to business development,"" he wrote.Overall, Credit Suisse sees Bristol having a positive impact on Pfizer's return on capital. An all-cash deal, assuming Pfizer pays a 25% premium and can extract 30% synergies, would lead to value creation of 80 cents a share.But if Pfizer opts for a cash-and-stock deal, ""dilution from issuing 'undervalued' shares will offset the initial value creation,"" analysts wrote. ""A deal partially financed with an 18% stock issuance would be a break-even for Pfizer shareholders.""IBD'S TAKE: Bristol-Myers has two immuno-oncology drugs approved, meaning it competes against other FDA-approved treatments from Roche and Merck. Head to IBD's Technology page for a breakdown of this drug sector.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Bristol was up fractionally to 56.04 while Pfizer ticked up 0.5% to 34.18.

255,PFE,"Teva Pharmaceuticals' (TEVA) woes are set to deepen in 2017 as generic-drug prices are projected to topple 7% to 10%, Argus analysts John Eade and Katelyn Bayone said Tuesday as they downgraded the stock.Shares are trading at 10-year lows after falling 7% over the past quarter, where the S&P 500 saw a 7% increase. Over the past year, Teva stock lost 38% as the index gained 21%, Argus analysts wrote. In the stock market today, Teva fell 1.1% to 35.02 and is right at its 50-day moving average, but the stock has been below its 200-day line for more than a year.Argus downgraded Teva stock to hold from buy, citing a ""plague"" of problems. Teva recently lost four of five patents protecting multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone, and former CEO Erez Vigodman stepped down amid a DOJ investigation and bribery scandal in Russia, Ukraine and Mexico.Despite the Copaxone patent losses, Teva kept its 2017 guidance for $23.8 billion to $24.5 billion in sales and $4.90 to $5.30 earnings per share excluding certain items, which would be up 10% and flat, respectively. Pfizer (PFE) and Momenta (MNTA) are working on a Copaxone copy, though they are facing manufacturing issues.Teva cut its expectations on full-year sales of Copaxone by $1 billion to $1.3 billion and expects that to have a 75-cent to 95-cent impact on EPS minus items. The company is appealing the patent losses, but interim CEO Yitzhak Peterburg, on the company's earnings conference call this month, said to expect continued price erosion amid generic competition.IBD'S TAKE: Teva stock has a low IBD Composite Rating of 32, meaning it underperforms more than a third of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Ani Pharmaceuticals leads the group with a better CR of 85, out of a best-possible 99.

On top of those struggles, Teva must repay more than $21 billion in debt over the next five years, including $5.3 billion due in 2018. Among other things, Teva is paying for its acquisition of Actavis' generics business.Former generics CEO Sigurdur Olafsson stepped down in December. Olafsson was ""well-regarded"" at Actavis, Argus analysts said, and had held positions with the company since 2003. He was expected to be instrumental in the integration of Actavis' generics business, Argus analysts said.In the aftermath of the Actavis generics acquisition and as Copaxone sales are hit by generic competition, Argus says Teva could engage in M&A to grow. But ""it is likely to face antitrust hurdles"" and ""there are few (if any) attractive large targets,"" the analysts wrote.RELATED:Momenta, Pfizer Give Teva Pharma Breathing Room On Generic MS DrugTeva Maintains 2017 Guidance Despite Copaxone Patent Losses; Q4 TopsTeva CEO Steps Down After Patent Losses, Bribery Settlement; Stock Dives

256,PFE,"Momenta (MNTA) and Pfizer (PFE) are unexpectedly giving Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) some breathing room on a generic version of MS drug Copaxone after a manufacturing delay announced late Friday for a Teva rival drug — prompting Teva stock to rebound Tuesday.In the stock market today, Teva stock lifted as much as 7.8% to a six-week high of 37.94, closing Tuesday's regular session at 36.64, up 4.1%. Momenta stock, on the other hand, tumbled 15% to 16.05, crashing below its 50-day moving average. Momenta is partnering with Novartis (NVS) subsidiary Sandoz on the generic drug. Novartis stock slipped 0.21% Tuesday to 77.04.The Food and Drug Administration issued Pfizer a warning letter following an inspection of one of its fill/finish factories. That factory is a key piece of Momenta/Sandoz's supply chain for 40-milligram Glatopa, the generic rival to Copaxone.Momenta says it's unlikely the FDA will approve the 40-mg drug in Q1.""Under FDA policy, an approval of the application is dependent on the satisfactory resolution of the compliance observations at the Pfizer facility used to make the final product,"" Momenta said late Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Teva stock is ranked ninth in IBD's 17-company generic drugs industry group with a Composite Rating of 28 out of a best-possible 99 based on key growth metrics. Head to IBD's Stock Checkup for a list of the top five generic drugmakers.Analysts broadly pushed back their timelines for Glatopa's 40-mg launch to Q2 and Q3. The letter doesn't restrict the production or shipment of 20-mg Glatopa already marketed by Sandoz in the U.S.The delay could also put Mylan (MYL) and partner Natco in the lead on generic filing, Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler wrote in a research report. She has an underperform rating and 27 price target on Teva stock.""Mylan previously indicated to us that the Copaxone first-filer status is shared, which may unexpectedly put Mylan's molecule in the lead if it can gain FDA approval ahead of Momenta,"" she wrote. ""We currently model both generic launches in the second half of 2017.""Mylan stock edged up 0.59% Tuesday to 42.30.Koffler expects Momenta's 40-mg Glatopa to launch in Q3 and Mylan's product in Q4.RBC analyst Randall Stanicky called the delay on Glatopa 40-mg opportune for Teva.RELATED:Acorda Must Stave Off Mylan, Teva Generics To Protect AmpyraTeva Maintains 2017 Guidance Despite Copaxone Patent Losses; Q4 TopsTeva CEO Steps Down After Patent Losses, Bribery Settlement; Stock Dives

257,PFE,"A key House committee has proposed delaying any changes in Medicaid funding until 2020 to win over moderate Republicans as the effort to repeal and replace the major parts of ObamaCare runs into trouble.Although the ability of Republicans to bridge a wide divide between moderates and conservatives still looks iffy, especially in the Senate, the signal of retreat on Medicaid cuts had the health care sector breathing a sigh of relief.While the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite were slightly negative as of early afternoon in the stock market today, health stocks were mostly higher.Among hospitals, HCA Holdings (HCA) closed up 1.4% at 88.53, while Tenet Healthcare (THC) jumped 10% to 20.99 and Universal Health Services (UHS) gained 2.2% to 125.58.Among insurers, Molina Healthcare (MOH) was unchanged at 49.99, and Aetna (AET) climbed 0.9% to 130.69, while Dow component UnitedHealth Group (UNH) edged up 0.5% 168.20.Drugmakers, which also have benefited from President Trump backing away from earlier threats of an intervention to bring down the high cost of prescriptions, were mixed. Dow component Merck (MRK) rose 0.8%, but Pfizer (PFE), another Dow member, ended flat.IBD'S TAKE: The difficulty of Republicans in settling on a replacement for ObamaCare is threatening to sidetrack the rest of President Trump's economic agenda, including tax cuts and infrastructure spending.The House Energy and Commerce Committee, which plays a key role in shaping health reform, will release a plan next week maintaining Medicaid funding levels until 2020, before cuts would take effect, the Wall Street Journal reported.The retreat by the House comes as GOP governors have been making their voices heard about preserving ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion. Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, who has embraced the Medicaid expansion, met with Trump a week ago and has been among the leaders of the effort.RELATED:Biotechs Leap On Trump's Calls For Innovation, Speedy FDA ApprovalTrump's Big Speech Leaves Investors With Hope, Not Much Else

258,PFE,"When Brandon Schatz learned in December 2012 that Kansas City, Kan., had become the first city in the nation to get Google Fiber, a superfast internet service, he started making plans to move his nascent sports photography business there. The day after Christmas, he drove the 165 miles from his home in Springfield, Mo., to check it out. By Feb. 1, he had settled into his new house. By Feb. 4, he was connected to the network. That was exactly what officials had wanted. When the area (first Kansas City, Kan., with Kansas City, Mo., added weeks later) won a challenge to be the first to get Google Fiber, local boosters celebrated, hoping to kick-start an economic renaissance: attracting entrepreneurs, cultivating emerging business districts, and becoming known as a major startup hub.Four years later, Schatz's company Sportsphotos.com, which takes photos of amateur sporting events around the country, is growing slowly. He's taking full advantage of the speedy internet, uploading hundreds of high-resolution photos in minutes from races and other matches. But the business isn't yet where he wants it to be, and for now Schatz's main source of income is web development work and renting out rooms in his home on Airbnb. On a recent Sunday, Schatz sat in his home, where he also operates his company, pecking away at a desktop, surrounded by pizza boxes. ""I thought we would be huge already,"" he said.Schatz's disappointment is a tale of misplaced expectations, by both entrepreneurs and city leaders. In 2011 the cities' two mayors called Fiber's then-future deployment ""a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,"" and a way to ""spark economic development."" And for Google, which since significantly has pared down support for the project, it was a case of placing too much faith in the ability of its own technology to change lives.It's also been hard for the Kansas City area to become the boom town that leaders dreamed of. Some entrepreneurs, like Schatz, were drawn to the city because of the fiber, and some launched businesses. A ""startup village"" sprang up. But few of the companies really took off, and some frustrated founders ended up decamping to San Francisco, where there was a larger talent pool and greater access to capital. Even the best of intentions and superspeedy internet isn't enough to create a new Silicon Valley.Every year after the first fiber connections lit up for Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google in late 2012, greater Kansas City's GDP growth has fallen well short of the national average. In 2015, it was just 1.5%, compared to 2.6% for the nation as a whole. Metro regional numbers aren't yet available for all of 2016, although based on state numbers through the third quarter, both Kansas and Missouri seem to be beating the national average.""We're scratching our heads a little bit,"" said Jeff Pinkerton of the Mid America Regional Council, a nonprofit that conducts economic research for greater Kansas City. ""Why is Kansas City really not taking off, especially with this asset like Google Fiber?""Google came to town in 2011. At Wyandotte High School auditorium, on the Kansas side, blue, red, yellow and green spotlights shone on a parade of dignitaries who addressed the audience. Google founder Sergey Brin spoke on a prerecorded video. After the announcement about fiber going into Kansas City, a Google vice president invited the crowd to a barbecue-laden celebration.Kansas City beat out more than 1,000 other cities for the debut Google fiber project, which aimed to compete against the telecommunications and cable giants that have dominated the market for internet access. Some analysts believed the ultimate goal was to encourage those competitors to improve their own services and thus the internet experience overall, which would bolster the environment for Alphabet's most lucrative business: online search.Mayors of both cities announced a team of civic leaders to figure out how best to leverage fiber, in entrepreneurship as well as other areas such as education. The group released a plan in 2012 that made recommendations ranging from nurturing technology districts to supporting tax credits for small technology businesses to creating mentor networks.Despite budget challenges, the state of Kansas has stuck by a pre-existing income tax credit of up to $50,000 for angel backers who invest in a young company. Working with a group called Techstars, Kansas City-based Sprint (S) created an incubator for startups. The Kauffman Foundation, a think tank based in Kansas City, Mo., started a weekly gathering for entrepreneurs.An area straddling State Line Road, the border, became the first neighborhood that Google wired for fiber, and a community of founders sprang up. The district, which had zoning laws that made it easier to run a business from home, became known as Startup Village. That's where Schatz, the owner of Sportsphotos.com, moved into a rental house.It was an online video about the Kansas City experiment that drew him. He realized that Google Fiber could be the key to his nascent business: Batches of photos that took 40 to 50 hours to upload would be done in less than one. ""It's a little nerdy, to see this video and be all kinds of inspired,"" says Schatz, 34, a boyish looking former U.S. Army sergeant whose tours of duty included Bosnia. ""But I was inspired.""Yet in practice, a dazzling internet connection didn't mean much for some businesses. Mike Farmer operated his startup, Leap, a search engine, out of a Startup Village house for a while. ""What do you do with gigabit speed that makes the experience more relevant?"" he recalls asking his team. They goofed around with ideas, such as having search results take the form of several high-definition Netflix movies streaming at the same time. Given that most users wouldn't have gigabit internet, Leap never did find the right scenario. Farmer wound down the business last year.""The true power of Google fiber is exposure,"" says Matthew Marcus, executive director of the Kansas City Startup Foundation and co-leader of the Startup Village, referring to the publicity the technology brought to the city's startup community. ""The fact is, it's really difficult to consume one gigabit of speed.""Some startups have contended with the lack of access to a big talent pool. Tech companies in Silicon Valley, Waterloo, Canada, and New York City, tend to hire from nearby universities with strong software-engineering programs. The schools with the strongest engineering schools in the region are more than two hours away from Kansas City, though.Funding has also been a problem in Kansas City. Entrepreneurs lamented that local investors looked for the type of traction that would merit tens of millions of dollars from Silicon Valley venture firms. But if businesses achieve that, Midwestern venture firms invest just single-digit millions. Lack of access to capital contributed to the departure of two promising Kansas City startups, bond marketplace Neighborly and green-homebuilder Acre, which both moved most operations to Silicon Valley.""There are plenty of angels that will write $50,000 checks, but there's not that much bridge,"" says Sandy Kemper, chief executive officer of Fairway, Kansas-based C2FO, a working-capital finance company he founded in 2008. Kemper turned to big investors outside Kansas City, including San Francisco's Mithril Capital and Singapore's Temasek Holdings, for most of his backing. In his hometown, ""there is a finer filter, and maybe a little bit higher hurdle.""One advantage cited by many local entrepreneurs, low costs, can actually backfire. ""It might be a misplaced sense of comfort,"" says Ajay Royan, the general partner at Mithril Capital who invested in C2FO. He believes the best entrepreneurs work with an intensity driven by the reality of global competition — a reality too easily lost sight of in a low-pressure, low-cost environment. ""If you get comfortable with the fact that things seem to be going well in Kansas City,"" he says, and don't think beyond it, ""that's bad.""C2FO is one many other entrepreneurs hope will eventually list on a public market and raise hundreds of millions of dollars, with a valuation north of a billion. It has already raised $99 million and is used by some of the world's biggest companies, including Acer, Costco (COST), Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKA) BNSF Railway, and Pfizer (PFE). That type of public offering, more than anything, would truly foster entrepreneurship in Kansas City, entrepreneurs say. It would show existing investors the upside of investing more than a few thousand dollars in startups, along with creating a class of richly rewarded early employees who would in turn likely become investors in other startups — or founders of their own.Lance LeMay, a venture capitalist at Kansas City, Mo.-based Open Air Equity Partners who invested in Kemper's and Farmer's companies, said boosting the venture-backed startup ecosystem in Kansas City won't even take that much. ""More than a billion-dollar exit, you need lots of successful exits,"" he said. ""You don't need a home run. You need lots of doubles.""In the years that Kansas City has been trying to make the most out of Fiber, Google has been doing the same. In early days, company executives talked it up, with executive chairman Eric Schmidt telling conference goers in late 2012 that of all the company's current innovations, including self-driving cars, it was Google's ""most compelling on many levels,"" something that ""changes your life."" Shortly afterward, it started announcing more cities for the project, beginning with Austin, Texas, and Provo, Utah. In 2013, the company recruited Craig Barratt, a wireless chip industry veteran, to lead the group that included Fiber. In 2015, when Google became Alphabet, Barratt was given the title of CEO. Over time, Google Fiber announced it would expand into 21 cities.But just as Kansas City might have overestimated the asset that Google Fiber could become, Google overestimated Fiber's impact, and its expansion plans deflated. Barratt left in October 2016, surprising many employees. The same day, the unit announced it was stalling expansion plans in eight cities and cutting 9% of its staff. This month, Alphabet hired Barratt's replacement, broadband executive Gregory McCray, and further slimmed Fiber, shifting hundreds of its employees over to Google's core internet business.Fiber is now in only nine locations, including Atlanta and Orange County, Calif. Other Bets, the part of Alphabet that Google Fiber belongs to, reported losses of $3.58 billion last year on revenue of $809 million. It also contributed to Other Bets' $1.39 billion in capital expenditures.A number of factors lay behind Fiber's strategic shift. Former employees said a chief reason was the discrepancy between the desires of Google's co-founders to expand the service and make it faster and the demanding costs of providing it. Cable incumbents moved aggressively, introducing similar high-speed services at low prices. Unexpected political hurdles emerged. In Louisville, Ky., for instance, AT&T (T) and Charter Communications (CHTR) sued Google Fiber over a wonky utility-bill regulation.""Google invested in Fiber during a time when it was willing to make lots of big investments with uncertain or long-term returns, but over the last couple of years Google has become a different place,"" says Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. ""It doesn't necessarily make sense for Alphabet to continue to invest in it as heavily at this point.""Schatz recently changed his business model. Instead of getting amateur athletes to pay for the photos, they download them for free, with sponsorship fees providing his revenue. Having observed the reluctance of local investors to back companies that lack strong income, he is working to build relationships with big sports retailers and fitness companies that could sponsor the blanket photography of the events he shoots.The race-photography business alone is worth $20 million to $50 million annually a year on sponsorships, he calculates; add in other amateur sports and expanded marketing initiatives and it could be exponentially more. But for now, he's capturing just a tiny portion; revenue last year doubled but was still under $100,000, he says. This year, he hopes to keep growing and achieve profitability.He knows developing ties to potential sponsors would be much easier in a city like New York or Los Angeles, but he believes he can pull it off from the heartland.Sometimes, he thinks back to advice a venture capitalist gave him a few years ago, to drop everything else and focus only on his business. The laid-back atmosphere in Kansas City made it easier to put that advice aside, he says.""It probably would have been good to have extra pressure,"" he says now. Still, he says perks such as a community of fellow entrepreneurs make him happy he stayed put.Meanwhile, some of the original startup supporters in Startup Village have sold their real estate to non-entrepreneurs.After Google Fiber came to town, Brad Feld, a venture capitalist at Boulder, Colo.-based Foundry Group bought a bungalow in Startup Village for use, gratis, by a promising young company. For a time, Leap's Farmer housed interns there. Today, a startup engineer lives in the house. On a recent visit, a layer of dark fuzz and grime obscured floors. A vacuum cleaner stood at the far end of the main room, plugged in but apparently unused. A side room lacked furniture, but did sport a large pile of clothing flung in its center. A skittish cat bolted across the kitchen.Three doors down the street, Schatz has decided to launch an intense search for financial backers. An early port of call: Silicon Valley.MORE ABOUT REAL ESTATE:Southeast Sees Rents Rise Despite High Vacancy RatesAre These The Hottest-Selling Suburbs In U.S.?U.S. Homebuyers' Break-Even Point Just Got A Little More DistantSurvey Finds That The Most Affordable Major Housing Markets Are In America

Drugs from AstraZeneca and Clovis are already approved in ovarian cancer. Clovis stock jumped 7.2% Friday to 65.80.Lynparza was first approved to treat ovarian cancer in December 2014. Early Friday, AstraZeneca said the drug showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit in improving progression-free survival in HER2-negative, germline BRCA-mutated breast cancer.""This is the first Phase 3 readout for a PARP inhibitor in breast cancer and will likely have positive read-through for similarly designed trials of Pfizer's talazoparib and Tesaro's niraparib,"" Fernandez wrote in a research report.

260,PFE,"Britain's Reckitt Benckiser Group said Friday it agreed to buy U.S.-based Mead Johnson Nutrition (MJN) for $16.6 billion, taking the U.K. consumer-products maker into the baby-formula market and providing a catalyst for growth as its sales momentum slows.Shares of Mead Johnson, based in suburban Chicago, surged nearly 5% in the first minutes of trading Friday to 87.04.The $90-a-share takeover will add to earnings within a year and lead to the equivalent of $250 million of cost savings after three years, said Reckitt, the maker of Lysol cleaners. Reckitt shares fell, reversing early gains, as the company forecast 2017 revenue gains below analyst estimates.Reckitt Benckiser's biggest-ever takeover boosts growth prospects after 2016 revenue advanced at the slowest pace in more than five years amid tough conditions in Europe and emerging markets like Brazil. A $480 million breakup fee reduces the chance of a counter-offer for Mead Johnson, which has been touted as a takeover candidate since the maker of Enfamil went public in 2009.""This deal has potential to reignite top-line growth, the only area where the Reckitt model appears lacking,"" said Deborah Aitken, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.The offer price is the same as the companies indicated when they announced the negotiations on Feb. 1. The bid values the target at 17 times earnings compared with multiples of 20 that Nestle (NSRGY) paid for Pfizer's (PFE) baby-formula unit in 2012 and 22 that Danone (DANOY) paid for baby-food maker Numico in 2007, according to John Baumgartner, an analyst at Wells Fargo.The debt-funded acquisition will add to per-share earnings in the first full year and will be ""double-digit accretive"" by the third year, Reckitt Benckiser said.""This looks just about achievable to us at first blush,"" Martin Deboo, an analyst at Jefferies, said of the cost-saving forecast.The announcement of the deal was accompanied by Reckitt Benckiser's fourth-quarter results, which were brought forward from Monday and missed expectations. The company reported comparable sales growth of 1% vs. a company-compiled consensus estimate of 1.7%. Full-year operating profit was in line with estimates at 28.1% of sales.The U.K. company also forecast 3% growth in comparable sales this year, below analyst estimates for a gain of about 4.2%. The first quarter has gotten off to a ""soft"" start as a new product in the Scholl foot-care line failed to live up to expectations, Chief Executive Rakesh Kapoor said at a press conference.""In 2017, we expect macro conditions to remain challenging, and for a number of existing headwinds to persist in the first half,"" Kapoor said in a statement.Although not previously considered by analysts to be an obvious acquirer of Mead Johnson, Reckitt Benckiser has had the U.S. company on its radar for a number of years, Kapoor said Friday on a conference call.The purchase will add baby formula to a portfolio of consumer brands that include Nurofen painkillers, Strepsils throat lozenges and French's mustard. Reckitt Benckiser has proven able to enter and thrive in new categories before, as it did when it acquired Durex condom maker SSL International in 2010. And it already has a toe in the nutrition business from its 2012 purchase of Schiff Nutrition, which makes Omega-3 supplements and joint-pain pills.One of the main reasons for the takeover is to increase Reckitt Benckiser's presence in the developing markets of Asia. Mead Johnson trails Nestle and Danone in the global baby-nutrition business, though it's second only to Nestle in Asia, the biggest market.Baby food will likely be one of Asia's fastest-growing food categories, even as the industry contends with near-term headwinds, Bloomberg Intelligence noted in December.Reckitt Benckiser said it expects to complete the takeover by the end of the third quarter and expects to retain a ""strong"" investment-grade credit rating.Robey Warshaw and Bank of America Merrill Lynch acted as joint lead financial advisors to Reckitt Benckiser, which also received advice from Deutsche Bank and HSBC. Mead Johnson was advised by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.

261,PFE,"To satisfy the Trump administration's calls to deal with high U.S. drug costs, one industry leader is proposing that the president lead negotiations with drugmakers to restrain prices.Allergan (AGN) Chief Executive Brent Saunders cited tactics used by President John F. Kennedy decades ago to keep down steel prices. The administration also could waive federal antitrust rules that currently prohibit drugmakers from discussing pricing so they could put together guidelines to follow, he said.Voluntary agreements that restrain prices are ""a very practical solution that doesn't, in my view, do anything to impede innovation,"" Saunders said Wednesday in an interview at Bloomberg's headquarters in New York. Convincing fellow drugmakers to agree with him, however, could be a challenge.""It would be difficult,"" Saunders said.Big Pharma is under intense pressure to come up with ways to reduce prices after President Trump accused the companies of ""getting away with murder"" and threatened to use the government's buying power to force prices down.Saunders has been outspoken against excessive price hikes in his own industry. At Allergan, an $80 billion company whose products range from wrinkle treatment Botox to stomach and schizophrenia medicines, the CEO has implemented a ""social contract"" that caps increases at 10% annually.Trump ""could model something like that with the pharmaceutical industry — maybe that could look like something like our social contract,"" Saunders said. ""It's easy for me to suggest when we're already doing it, just to be transparent,"" he added. Asked about a targeted amount under restraint agreements, he said low single digits, or about the rate of inflation.Pharmaceutical giants including Novartis (NVS), Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical and AbbVie (ABBV) also have taken voluntary actions to cap price increases. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Merck (MRK) have taken steps to increase transparency about their prices.""The industry has moved quite a bit in three months, four months,"" Saunders said. ""But it would need another big push.""Under Saunders, Allergan has transformed itself into a specialty pharmaceutical behemoth after a series of acquisitions and the sale of its generics business. After an attempt to merge with Pfizer (PFE) Inc. in a $160 billion megadeal that was abandoned last year, Allergan has focused on smaller purchases.Allergan's shares are down compared with the rest of the industry. Over the last 12 months, they've lost 14%, compared with a 7.6% gain in the 25-company Standard and Poor's 500 Pharmaceuticals, Biotechnology & Life Sciences Index, which includes Allergan.Rather than another transformational deal, Saunders is more interested in building up Allergan's main therapeutic areas, including medical aesthetics and dermatology, eye care, central nervous system and gastroenterology. In the past two months, he's made two acquisitions worth a combined $5 billion to add to Allergan's aesthetic-medicine and cosmetic-surgery lines.Hair restoration and skin quality are the next frontiers, he said. The company is currently doing research in both of those areas.""Those are huge unmet needs,"" he said.When asked about Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX) whose assets include the Bausch & Lomb eye-care company that he once led, Saunders says he's not interested — not even ""in pieces.""Valeant didn't respond to a request seeking comment.

Amgen, which had its patents reaffirmed, enjoyed a 2.5% gain, to 157.15.IBD'S TAKE: The biotech sector suffered a raucous election year in 2016, but five leaders ended the year with triple-digit gains. Were your stock picks on that list? Get the deep dive on IBD Industry Themes.BioMarin Pharmaceutical stock rose 0.65% to 86.85, and The Medicines Co. jumped 1.4% to 36.23, on the suggestion that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals or Sanofi could issue a bid on them to make up the $1 billion to $2 billion lost on the potential removal of Praluent from the U.S. market. BioMarin has a market cap near $15 billion, while The Medicines Co. has a cap near $2.5 billion.France-based Sanofi, which has a market cap near $104 billion, has been particularly vexed in recent years on M&A. It lost out on Medivation and its blockbuster cancer drug, Xtandi, in a battle with Pfizer (PFE) last year. Last month, Sanofi was said to be jockeying with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) for Swiss biotech Actelion Pharmaceuticals.""The revenue loss may theoretically cause Sanofi to continue to increase its M&A activity and we have written BioMarin makes a good fit because of its pure play orphan franchises, which are synergistic with Sanofi's orphan franchises,"" RBC analyst Michael Yee said Friday in a research note.Yee estimates BioMarin as a $20 billion to $21 billion deal, slightly above Sanofi's acquisition price of Genzyme for $20 billion several years ago. He has an outperform rating and 125 price target on BioMarin stock.Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz sees The Medicines Co. appealing to Regeneron, Sanofi or any parties interested in the PCSK9 space. The Medicines Co. and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) have partnered on inclisiran, a drug aimed at lowering LDL cholesterol.Schwartz notes in the aftermath of the Praluent injunction, set to go into effect in 30 days, that inclisiran is ""second in line to come to market in the PCSK9 space."" A New England Journal of Medicine article describes inclisiran as an RNA interference therapeutic inhibitor of PCSK9.In November, The Medicines Co. and Alnylam delivered strong results for inclisiran in a phase two trial. Investors should expect more clarity on phase three testing in Q1, Schwartz wrote. He has an outperform rating on shares of The Medicines Co.RELATED:Regeneron, Sanofi LDL-Buster At Risk After Judge Upholds Amgen PatentsMedtronic Downgraded On Increased Boston, St. Jude, J&J Rivalries

266,PFE,"Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Roche (RHHBY) will pressure Merck (MRK) in 2018 with a slew of lung cancer drugs designed to chip at Keytruda's share, Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford said Monday, as he downgraded Merck stock.On the stock market today, Merck fell 2.1% to 61.14, while Bristol-Myers Squibb climbed 1.4% to 59.43. Merck and Bristol-Myers are locked in a battle over the non-small cell lung cancer market with drugs that leverage a patient's immune system to battle the cancer.Holford downgraded Merck stock to underperform, with a 48 price target. He expects strong Keytruda performance in 2017, followed by pressure in 2018 as rival drugs from Bristol, AstraZeneca and Roche chip away at Keytruda's market.IBD'S TAKE: Next year will be marked by a new presidency. What path will Donald Trump take on drug prices?""Merck screens poorly on many valuation metrics to us, and we have downgraded the shares to underperform,"" Holford wrote in a research report. In the same note, he upgraded Bristol stock to a buy, with a 69 price target.Holford expects two Opdivo trials to secure Bristol's future in 2017.More broadly, he prefers AbbVie (ABBV) and Eli Lilly (LLY) stocks in the U.S. and AstraZeneca and Novartis (NVS) stocks in Europe.He sees Pfizer (PFE), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Merck, Sanofi (SNY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) as the least preferred stocks.RELATED:Gilead Must Pay Merck $2.5 BillionFor Hep C Patent; Agios Stock Anemic

267,PFE,"For the first time since winning election, Donald Trump vowed to take on drug prices and win:""I'm going to bring down drug prices. I don't like what's happened with drug prices,"" Trump told Time magazine, which named the president-elect its Person of the Year.As investors continue to assess what Trump's policies will mean for markets, those few words had a jarring impact at the start of trading on Wednesday. Shares of drugmakers and biotechs were hit with Mylan (MYL) off 3.8% at 34.50 on the stock market today and the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) down 2.9% at 266.28. Pfizer (PFE) fell 1.2% to 31.19.Trump also doubled-down on his goal to shift the tide of global trade — by getting CEOs on the phone for five minutes.""I want to get a list of companies that have announced they're leaving,"" he told the magazine. ""I can call them myself five minutes apiece, they won't be leaving. OK.""There are plenty of reasons to doubt just how much of an impact Trump can have in restoring lost manufacturing jobs and curbing America's trade deficit, and whether his efforts might backfire to some extent, but Trump is showing he's fully engaged in the challenge.""I said to Tim Cook, it's my ambition to get Apple (AAPL) to build a great plant, your biggest and your best, even if it's only a foot by a foot bigger than some place in China,"" he told Time.IBD'S TAKE: As markets assess how Trump's trade policies will work out, U.S. industrial companies that get most of their revenue at home are among the biggest post-election winners, including Nucor, Steel Dynamics and Martin Marietta. Check out IBD Leaderboard to track which stocks are leading the market.While analysts have cast doubt on a major shift of iPhone production from China to the U.S., Foxconn, which has some 200,000-plus Chinese workers assembling the Apple iPhone, gave Trump a small victory on Wednesday. The company confirmed that it is eyeing an expansion of its U.S. operations.Apple shares rose 1% to 111.03.The announcement came a day after Masayoshi Son, CEO of Japan's Softbank, which owns Sprint (S), met with Trump and discussed his plans to invest $50 billion in the U.S.Trump's aggressive use of his bully pulpit, along with his plan to bring down corporate tax rates, helped convince United Technologies (UTX) unit Carrier to keep open an Indiana plant slated for closure.Other companies have felt what it's like to be on the wrong side of a Trump tweet.

268,PFE,"European, Japanese or specialty pharma could look to acquire Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIA) as it rapidly closes in on U.S. approval of an orphan lung cancer drug, RBC analyst Michael Yee said Wednesday.Yee expects Ariad stock to spike in the first half of 2017 as it approaches the Prescription Drug Free User Act (PDUFA) date on brigatinib, a cancer drug aimed at treating anaplastic lymphoma kinase positive (ALK+) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) resistant to crizotinib.Crizotinib is a chemotherapy developed by Pfizer (PFE) to treat NSCLC. On Wednesday, Ariad unveiled the results of a phase 2 trial of NSCLC patients resistant to Pfizer's chemo drug. At a median follow-up of 11 months, 55% of patients on a 180-milligram regimen achieved an objective response.Brigatinib increased median progression-free survival (PFS) to 15.6 months from 12.9 months after failed crizotinib therapy. Additionally, in patients whose cancer had metastasized to the brain, 67% showed an intracranial objective response. Intracranial PFS was 18.4 months.IBD'S TAKE: Drug and biotech stocks plunged Wednesday on President-Elect Donald Trump's comments that he would seek to curb drug prices. Check out this deep dive in IBD'S Industry Themes.On average, rivals of brigatinib have extended PFS by eight to 10 months, Yee wrote in a client note. Brigatinib has the potential ""to be a best-in-class second-line (ALK+) lung cancer drug"" and could possibly also be the best first-line defense, he wrote.Ariad's first-line data won't be available until 2018-19, though. Competitor Roche (RHHBY) has first-line data for rival drug alectinib due in 2018. In that interim, Yee has plenty of questions for Ariad that could upend its future stock price.""When will Ariad hire a sales force in the spring for brigatinib and does the Street think they'll launch themselves and thus no takeout near-term, or will Ariad be sold before or after the PDUFA?"" he said. ""Does Ariad sell off brigatinib EU rights and thus reduce M&A potential?""Yee also has questions on Ariad's Iclusig, a med to treat chronic myeloid leukemia and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. He questions whether the lack of a 30-mg bottle could limit M&A options.He notes Ariad's $2.6 billion market cap, meaning it wouldn't be a heavy acquisition for a Japanese, European or specialty pharmaceutical company looking to expand its presence in the U.S. Becoming a two-cancer drug company would make Ariad a ""notable scarcity in biotech,"" Yee wrote.Comparable biotechs Exelixis (EXEL), Array BioPharma (ARRY), Tesaro (TSRO) and Clovis (CLVS) all rocketed on major cancer data into or after U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, Yee wrote. So, ""it's reasonable to see how Aria will go up, because the chances of M&A also up as we get closer to that FDA approval.""Yee kept his sector perform rating on Ariad stock, but boosted his price target to 14 from 10. He sees M&A valuations around 13-20 per share depending on peak sales of brigatinib and Iclusig. Assuming $500 million to $700 million, he puts a $3 billion to $4 billion valuation on Ariad.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Ariad stock fell 6.8% to 12.76. But most drug stocks were have a tough day after President-Elect Donald Trump told Time magazine he would go after spiraling drug prices. Hillary Clinton had been seen as tougher on drug prices and biotech and drug stocks had originally surged on Trump's election.RELATED:Drug Stocks Fall On Trump Pledge To Curb PricesAriad Could Follow Gilead's — Or Mylan's — Route In Drug Price Battle'Blockbuster Franchises' Spark M&A Fever For Sarepta, Ariad, BiotechsAerie Pharmaceuticals Skyrockets On Eye Drug News

269,PFE,"Biotechs Tesaro (TSRO), Kite Pharma (KITE) and Loxo Oncology (LOXO) are expected to report second-quarter losses Tuesday, but investors will likely tune in for more from their early cancer pipelines.XOf the trio, Tesaro will likely have the most robust sales. Tesaro has two approved drugs in the U.S. including Varubi and Zejula. Varubi treats nausea associated with chemotherapy. Zejula is approved to treat some patients with ovarian cancer after they've undergone chemotherapy.Zejula is what's known as a PARP inhibitor. It rivals approved drugs from Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and AstraZeneca (AZN). Dow's Pfizer (PFE) is also working on a PARP inhibitor.For its second quarter, analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research call for Tesaro to report adjusted losses of $2.52 per share on $16 million in sales. In the year-earlier period, Tesaro had $36.6 million in sales due to license revenue. Losses were narrower at $1.28 per share.Kite is working in a nascent area of immuno-oncology called CAR-T therapy. In this treatment, immune system cells are extracted from a patient, reprogrammed to fight cancer cells and then reintroduced to the body.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs hit an 18-month high in late July, but biotech fever could be cooling. IBD's 443-company Biotech industry group is now ranked fifth out of 197 groups tracked by IBD. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at why the group could topple — and what could save it.The Food and Drug Administration is expected late this year to approve a CAR-T drug from Kite, dubbed KTE-19, as a treatment in an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. That approval is expected to follow a similar CAR-T approval for Novartis (NVS) in a bone marrow cancer.For its second quarter, analysts expect Kite to report $9 million in sales and adjusted losses of $1.97 per share. On a year-over-year basis, revenue would grow 87.5%. Adjusted losses would widen from 91 cents per share in the year-earlier period.Loxo is working on drugs to treat cancers with specific genetic mutations. It doesn't have any drugs approved, so it isn't expected to have sales in the second quarter. Losses are expected to widen to 99 cents per share from a 77-cent per-share loss in the year-ago quarter.RELATED:Why This Biotech Is Jumping Today On Its Rival's Cannabis-Tied DrugHow Novartis' FDA Win In Cancer Also Could Be A Boon For Its RivalsNovartis Grabs Key FDA Panel Approval Of Experimental Cancer Drug

270,PFE,"Shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX) were rising Monday as the company continued to fill out its new management lineup by appointing a new chief financial officer.Valeant nabbed Paul Herendeen from animal-health company Zoetis (ZTS), where he has been executive vice president for the last two years. He also was CFO for a number of years at Warner Chilcott before its 2013 buyout by the company that eventually became Allergan (AGN). Valeant's current CFO, Robert Rosiello, will become head of corporate development and strategy.The role of CFO is crucial because of Valeant's recent accounting scandal, which resulted in the company restating the last couple years of earnings. Rosiello wasn't implicated because the trouble really happened before his June 2015 appointment, under the previous CFO Howard Schiller, who took most of the heat when Valeant's auditing committee produced its report in March. At the same time, CEO J. Michael Pearson quit.IBD'S TAKE: Valeant became the poster child for a drugmaker relying on price increases to goose revenue. Learn how much other big-cap drugmakers are relying on price vs. demand.RBC Capital Markets analyst Douglas Miehm wrote that the change is probably due to matching the talent with the job.""We view the new role for Mr. Rosiello favorably, as he worked for McKinsey for over 30 years and has advised companies in the health care, consumer-product and technology sectors on M&A ventures and operational strategic initiatives,"" Miehm wrote in a research note.Valeant stock rose 8.8% to 31.27 in the stock market today, above 31 for just the second day in the past three months-plus.The rise might also have been fueled by a wider bounce in drug stocks viewed as buyout targets in light of Pfizer's (PFE) $14 billion buyout of Medivation (MDVN). In Valeant's Q2 earnings call, CEO Joseph Papa said he was prepared to sell off about $8 billion worth of assets, and some on Wall Street have wondered if a buyer might acquire the entire company now that it's down 87% from its 52-week high.RELATED:

271,PFE,"Drugmaker Medivation's (MDVN) stock was jumping Monday -- and lifting some other big biotechs with it -- after Pfizer (PFE) announced that it's acquiring the company for $14 billion in cash.The Pfizer-Medivation deal was formally announced after a weekend of leaks and a long campaign by big French pharma Sanofi (SNY) to take over the maker of prostate-cancer drug Xtandi. Sanofi didn't completely rule out making another bid, but its statement on Monday made it sound as though Pfizer's $81.50 a share in cash was too rich for its blood: ""While we recognized the potential strategic benefits of a combination with Medivation, we are first and foremost a disciplined acquirer and remain committed to acting in the best interests of Sanofi shareholders.""Medivation stock rose 20% to 80.42 on the stock market today. Shares of both Pfizer stock fell a fraction Monday.IBD'S TAKE: In the last five weeks, IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech Industry Group has risen from No. 126 to No. 36 out of 197 industry groups. This month, IBD looked at what's driving the biotech stock rally.Jefferies analysts noted that this might reignite speculation that Sanofi turn its attention to rare-disease specialist BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN). In June, BioMarin's stock rose on an anonymously sourced report at the blog Betaville that BioMarin was Sanofi's fallback option. On Monday, BioMarin stock popped 6.7% to 98.17.Meanwhile, Incyte (INCY), maker of the blood-cancer drug Jakafi and a perpetual object of buyout speculation with various partners, rose 7.7% to 81.98.In a research note sizing up several biotech buyout targets, BMO Capital Markets analyst Do Kim wrote that Incyte could go for $14.1 billion to $18.8 billion, based on a valuation of three to four times peak sales. While that wouldn't bring much of an upside to its current market cap of $15 billion, Kim added, ""We believe these companies could potentially command a higher multiple, given the limited number of late-stage clinical and commercial biotechs.""Others he named as likely targets include rare-disease players Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), which rose 3.3% and 3%, respectively, on Monday.RELATED:

Additionally, Japanese chipmaker Renesas Electronics says it's considering buying Silicon Valley analog and mixed signal chipmaker Intersil (ISIL) for up to $3 billion.ChemChina and Swiss seed company Syngenta (SYT) announced they had reached an agreement with the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States for the Chinese company's $43 billion bid for Syngenta, lifting the odds that the deal will go through. After months of wrangling, Pfizer announced a deal to acquire cancer drug maker Medivation for $81.50 a share. The acquisition is expected to quickly be accretive to Pfizer's earnings per share, boosting it by 5 cents in the first year after closing.Pfizer shares were down 0.4% at 34.84 in the stock market today. Pfizer stock hit a 12-year high of 37.39 on Aug. 1. Medivation jumped 19.7% to 80.42.RELATED:In a pairing that would expand Alimentation Couche-Tard's North American footprint, the Circle K parent said it will buy CST Brands, which operates more than 1,000 convenience stores in the U.S. and about 900 service stations in Canada, for $48.53 per share. The deal is valued at about $4.4 billion, including debt.CST shares fell 0.1% to 47.45.Milpitas, Calif.-based Intersil makes microprocessors for autos, aerospace and other markets. Renesas reportedly confirmed it's in talks with Intersil after reports said a $3 billion deal was near. A merger with Renesas, which the Financial Times reported is 69% owned by a Japanese-government-controlled fund, would created a global chip company with roughly $7.2 billion sales, with a heavy focus on auto-related chips.Intersil shares shot up 19.8% Monday to 18.74.RELATED:IBD'S TAKE: Several chipmakers, including Apple iPhone suppliers, have been making acquisitions to expand their automotive footprint. While other semiconductor sectors struggle, see how auto chip demand is racing ahead.U.S. shares of Switzerland-based Syngenta jumped 10.4% to 87.81 on word that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States had cleared ChemChina's $43 billion takeover of the company, another in a series of global clearances needed for the merger.The deal is being closely watched by Monsanto (MON), the world's largest seed company, Reuters said, as that company deliberates whether to sell itself to Germany's Bayer AG (BAYRY).

276,PFE,"Pfizer (PFE) doesn't expect Donald Trump's election and a Republican Congress to ease the U.S. drug-pricing debate, though the firm is optimistic on potential tax reform, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said Friday.Biotech and drug stocks have rallied following Trump's election, assuming he'll be less likely to tackle pricing reform than Hillary Clinton. IBD's generic drugs group is up 10% and the biotechs group is up 14% since the election.But Pfizer isn't ready to change its view on postelection pricing, Divan said.The ""debate around drug pricing will not go away and will not get any easier,"" he wrote in a research report. Pfizer has ""not changed any of their assumptions around pricing since the election.""IBD'S TAKE: Drugs and biotechs aren't the only sectors primed for success or failure on the election results. Check out IBD's Industry Snapshot to figure out which stocks might rocket — or tank — under Trump.Drug pricing has been a hot topic for several years. In September 2015, former Turing Pharmaceuticals CEO Martin Shkreli drew national criticism after hiking the price per pill on a decades' old HIV drug to $750 from $13.50.In September, Mylan (MYL) CEO Heather Bresch defended before a Congressional committee the company's sixfold increase in pricing on an EpiPen two-pack. Two EpiPens now cost north of $600 from about $100 in 2007.And though Pfizer is optimistic on potential tax reform under Trump's administration, the proposed incentive on cash repatriation is ""a one-time fix."" The key is moving to a territorial system, Divan wrote following his meeting with Pfizer.Politics aside, Pfizer still has a number of catalysts in the upcoming year. Before year's end, the stock could rocket on phase-two data for a vaccine to combat the diarrhea bacterium Clostridium difficile, or C. diff, and on Europe's approval of Xeljanz, an anti-inflammatory/cancer drug belonging to a class called JAK inhibitors, the analyst said.In 2017, Divan expects Pfizer to do well on U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of crisaborole, an eczema drug that was under development by Anacor Pharmaceuticals before Pfizer acquired that firm in June for $5.2 billion.Pfizer also has combination data with Darmstadt, Germany-based Merck KGaA due in 2017 for avelumab and Inlyta for multiple types of cancer.Divan edged up his earnings per share ex items expectations on Pfizer. He now sees Pfizer pulling in $2.54 and $2.66 in 2017 and 2018 from earlier models for $2.51 and $2.65. He reiterated his $2.42 view for 2016.On the stock market today, Pfizer stock dipped 0.85% to 31.46. Shares have been on a six-day downtrend, but still are up nearly 5% since the election.Editor's Note: Corrects third-to-last graph to properly identify the company Merck KGaA, which is unaffiliated with U.S.-based Merck.RELATED:Gilead Could Scoop Up Incyte After Cancer Drug Proves 'Not Good Enough'Pfizer Spikes On Report Its Mulling $14 Billion Consumer Care Sale

278,PFE,"Stocks opened lower Monday, as oil prices pulled back, the dollar edged higher and M&A news stirred a handful of dramatic early moves. But the major averages pared losses.The Nasdaq rose more than 0.1% after opening lower. The Dow industrials and S&P 500 fell less than 0.1% in the stock market today.Medivation (MDVN) soared 20% after Pfizer (PFE) said it would buy the San Francisco-based biotech in a $14 billion deal. Pfizer expects the Medivation deal to close before the end of the year and add a nickel to EPS in the first full year after consummation. Pfizer shares rose 0.5%.Switzerland's Syngenta (SYT) spiked nearly 11% after China National Chemical Corp. announced Monday that U.S. regulators had approved its acquisition of the seed strain and herbicide maker for $43 billion.Milpitas, Calif.-based chipmaker Intersil (ISIL) soared 24% at the open. Japan's Renesas Electronics confirmed Monday it was in discussions to buy Intersil.

Oil was pressured by a rising dollar, with some additional downward pull from official data showing China's exports of refined fuel products continued to surge in July, suggesting the country's domestic demand remains weak.

279,PFE,"Pfizer (PFE) announced a deal Monday morning to buy Medivation (MDVN) for $81.50 a share, or an enterprise value of about $14 billion.The move follows months of takeover speculation for the cancer drugmaker, as well as widespread reports Sunday of an imminent Pfizer-Medivation deal.Medivation rose nearly 20% to 80.43 soon after the opening bell on the stock market today. Pfizer fell 2 cents to 34.96.""The proposed acquisition of Medivation is expected to immediately accelerate revenue growth and drive overall earnings growth potential for Pfizer,"" Pfizer CEO and Chairman Ian Read said in a statement.Pfizer said the deal will boost earnings per share by five cents in the first year after closing, with additional gains after that.Medivation closed Friday at 67.16 with a market valuation of $11.1 billion. That was slightly extended from a 63.04 buy point from a flat base.Medivation traded as low as 26.41 on Feb. 9. But it's been the subject of widespread buzz over possible buyouts. The biotech earlier this year rejected a $58 a share offer from France's Sanofi (SNY).Last week, a report had Pfizer, Merck (MRK), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Celgene (CELG) and Sanofi as possible Medivation buyers.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs can deliver great growth. But are they generating profit and revenue gains via higher sales volumes or price increases? Here's how to hunt for biotech stocks.Medivation makes Xtandi, a prostate cancer drug with an annual sales rate already above $2 billion. It has other cancer fighters in development.Pfizer's $150 billion attempt to buy Allergan (AGN) fell apart earlier this year after the Obama administration changed rules to make tax inversion merger deals less attractive.RELATED:Medivation Affirms Guidance As Earnings Growth FlattensBiotechs Make Case For Leadership, But Is It A Convincing One?

In Wednesday's session, remarks from Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had triggered a steep 4.3% sell-off in this exchange traded fund. Clinton and some members of Congress questioned drugmaker Mylan (MYL) over the price of EpiPen, which has seen its price increase by 400% in the past decade. Clinton called the price hike ""outrageous.""Mylan responded on Thursday by expanding existing programs for patients who are facing higher out-of-pocket costs. The stock climbed nearly 2% intraday but ended in the red.A Clinton tweet back in September about price-gouging in the drug industry had triggered a 27%plunge in XBI in the span of a few trading sessions.IBD'S TAKE: Exchange traded funds offer investors exposure to a diversified basket of stocks, lowering portfolio risk. But it's always good to take a deeper dive into the best biotech stocks in your portfolio.Dave Mazza, head of research for SPDR ETFs, said political rhetoric ""shining a light on the drug industry in a possible negative way"" is fairly typical at this stage in an election cycle. He expects the primary driver of biotech stocks leading up to the November vote to be the political outlook rather than company-specific fundamentals.After the presidential elections, biotechs may benefit from a calmer environment and investors may find attractive valuations in this space in the interim, he told IBD in a phone call.XBI sits 25% off its 52-week high but has gained 12.9% in the third quarter through Aug. 24.As recently as Aug. 4, the biotech/biomedical group hit a multimonth high and was holding near that level following Monday's announcement of Pfizer's (PFE) deal to buy Medivation (MDVN).Here's how major exchange traded funds across major asset classes performed today, with IBD Relative Price Strength Ratings.The RS Rating is a measure of a stock's price performance over the last 12 months, compared with all stocks and ETFs, on a scale of 1 to a best-possible 99.Following daily ETF market action can be key to successful investing:SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), -0.1%, RS 51PowerShares QQQ (QQQ), -0.2%, RS 59SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA), -0.2%, RS 51IShares Core S&P Mid-Cap (IJH), +0.2%, RS 63IShares Russell 2000 (IWM), +0.2%, RS 63IShares MSCI EAFE (EFA), -0.4%, RS 31Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO), 0%, RS 73SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), -0.1%, RS 71United States Oil (USO), +1.2%, RS 18IShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond (AGG), -0.1%, RS 37PowerShares DB U.S.$ Bullish (UUP), 0%, RS 23IPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures (VXX), +0.1%, RS 1RELATED:Is Gold ETF Rally Over?

281,PFE,"Big pharma Eli Lilly (LLY) fell Wednesday when its breast cancer drug didn't prove to be the knockout that investors had hoped for.An outside committee conducted an interim analysis of Monarch-2, a late-stage trial of Lilly's drug abemaciclib combined with fulvestrant (AstraZeneca's (AZN) Faslodex) in advanced or metastatic breast cancer. If the drug was showing enough efficacy already, then the trial would have been stopped early, and Lilly could have gone ahead and filed for FDA approval. But the committee recommended that the study continue to its previously planned completion point.""We had stringent criteria set for this interim analysis, and we look forward to receiving the final Monarch-2 results in the first half of 2017,"" Richard Gaynor, Lilly's vice president of product development and medical affairs, said in a statement.Lilly stock fell 1.2% to 80.55 on the stock market today after falling as low as 79.67 intraday.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said this follows ambiguous results from a previous study of abemaciclib as a monotherapy, i.e. without fulvestrant.""While the single-agent response rate seemed to be better than that of the competition -- Pfizer's (PFE) palbociclib (Ibrance) and Novartis' (NVS) ribociclib -- it did not meet its primary endpoint,"" Fernandez wrote in a research note. ""Management indicated that it would file for approval after the Monarch-2 interim analysis.""At this point, we believe it is unlikely that it will be able to file for monotherapy in 3Q.""Fernandez added that both Pfizer and Novartis stopped their trials early for efficacy, so Lilly was widely expected to do so as well. All three of the drugs are in the same class, called cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors. Pfizer's Ibrance, approved in February 2015, has already passed $1.6 billion in sales.IBD'S TAKE: The timing of drug launches is important to drug stocks' future financial estimates, which are preferably going up. Lilly's estimates have recently been on the rise, as seen in its Stock Checkup.

284,PFE,"The Nasdaq stumbled as technology stocks came under heavy selling, with sector flagships such as Facebook (FB) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) down sharply Thursday afternoon.The composite pared losses to 0.6%. The Nasdaq 100, which is more heavily weighted on techs than the total composite, was down 1.4%. Facebook fell below the 200-day moving average before it started bouncing back. It was off 2% in heavy volume.Among the factors cited for the losses were spiking bond yields and mixed messages by President-elect Donald Trump on visas for immigrant workers.

285,PFE,"The stock market appeared to embrace Donald Trump's improbable presidential victory, sending the main indexes broadly higher.Stocks had been acting like they preferred a Hillary Clinton victory Monday and Tuesday, and futures did plummet overnight as results came in. But indexes shook off losses and marched higher, trading near session highs in the late afternoon.Indexes came off session highs but remained higher. The Dow Jones industrial average led with a 0.8% gain.

"
286,PFE,"Pfizer (PFE) stock popped Thursday on a report the drugmaker is considering selling its consumer care business for $14 billion, less than two months after the firm opted against a long-rumored corporate breakup.Evercore analyst John Scotti expects the potential transaction to garner 7 cents earnings per share in 2018, at the midpoint of the forecast, assuming after-tax proceeds of the sale are used for share buybacks.The potential sale makes sense, Scotti wrote in a research report Thursday, as Pfizer reassesses its future. Pfizer walked away from a $160 billion merger with Ireland-based Allergan (AGN) in April, after lawmakers looked to crack down on tax-inversion deals, where U.S. companies were setting up their headquarters in lower-tax regions such as Ireland. Pfizer also had long mulled a corporate breakup, splitting up its innovative and essential health divisions, but scrapped that idea in September.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) bought Pfizer's then consumer care business in 2006. Pfizer built that unit back up with its 2009 acquisition of Wyeth. Later, Pfizer sold its nutrition business to Nestle and spun off its animal health business, Zoetis (ZTS).""Thus, the sale of the current portfolio of consumer products appears to be a logical next step that will allow Pfizer to focus on its core competency — developing and selling innovative drugs,"" Scotti wrote.IBD'S TAKE: How will Trump's presidency affect drug and biotech stocks? Get the full skinny on IBD's Industry Themes.Reuters first reported the potential customer care sale late Wednesday, citing anonymous sources. The unit pulls in $3.5 billion in sales annually. Scotti likened it to Bayer's $14.2 billion acquisition of Merck's (MRK) consumer care business, a $2 billion annual unit.On the stock market today, Pfizer stock climbed 4.3% to 33.49, above its 50-day line, ramping for a second consecutive day following the election of President-elect Donald Trump. Shares rose 7.1% on Wednesday.Drug and biotech stocks have rebounded on Trump's election. Trump is seen as less likely to challenge drug prices vs. Democrat Hillary Clinton, who unveiled a plan last year to cut the spiraling price tags on drugs.Trump, though, has promised to tackle the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare), which investment bank RBC said Tuesday could cause a dip in biotech stocks on the uncertainty of new, not-yet-outlined national health care.Editor's Note: Corrects fourth graph to show Zoetis was a spinoff.RELATED:Pfizer Will Likely Overpay For M&A Post Allergan Breakup-Flop: JeffriesUnexpected Twist: Pfizer Scraps Breakup Following Dead Allergan Merger

"
288,PFE,"Big Pharma Merck (MRK) is now looking at a possible buyout of Medivation (MDVN), according to an anonymously sourced report.Reuters reported Wednesday afternoon that Merck was one of five big pharmas that have submitted indications of interest in buying Medivation, with the others being Sanofi (SNY), Pfizer (PFE), Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD).Sanofi has been very public about its attempt to acquire Medivation, and last month Medivation said it had entered a confidentiality agreement with Sanofi as well as other unnamed potential buyers. Earlier anonymously sourced reports said that Pfizer, Celgene and Gilead were among the interested buyers.There had been speculation that Merck might be interested: BMO Capital's May 5 research note asserted that Merck was preparing for a medium-size buyout and Medivation could be a target. Merck has been focusing much of its energy on cancer lately, and Medivation has one fast-growing drug on the market to treat prostate cancer and other cancer therapies in development.Medivation's stock had been trading flat on the stock market today, but popped to a 52-week high of 68.37 when the news came out. It closed up 1.9% at 66.48. Merck rose 0.4% to 63.29.IBD'S TAKE: Medivation was an IBD 50 stock up until its last earnings report, when year-over-year profit growth flattened and delivered a big hit to its EPS Rating. Analysts expect growth to pick up again starting in Q4, however. 
"
289,PFE,"Drugmakers on Tuesday continued to turn in solid Q2 earnings reports, with beats from Pfizer (PFE), Mallinckrodt (MNK) and Shire (SHPG) getting a mixed reaction from investors.Specialty-drug and hospital-products company Mallinckrodt made the biggest move, jumping more than 14% to 76.91 after it both beat analysts' second-quarter estimates and raised guidance. Earnings of $2.20 a share were more than 9% above a Thomson Reuters survey consensus, while revenue of $971 million was more than 5% over Wall Street's number.Growth did decelerate somewhat from the recent quarter, at 11% on the top line and 9% on the bottom line vs. the prior year. But Mallinckrodt also said it expects full-year EPS ""at the high end"" of its previously guided range of $8.15 to $8.50, which would put annual earnings growth at 15%.Acthar, the immunology drug that Mallinckrodt acquired when it bought Questcor a couple of years ago, shrugged off the critique that its business depends on sky-high pricing.""Acthar sales of $298.3 million beat consensus estimates of $282 million, and the brand grew 11% year over year (all attributed to volume, with some negative impact of price, which may hurt the bear thesis),"" wrote Mizuho Securities analyst Irina Koffler in a research note.British rare-disease company Shire climbed more than 4% to 202.24 on the stock market today after it also delivered a beat and raise. In contrast to Mallinckrodt, its growth has been accelerating, with a sales gain of 56% vs. just 4% a year ago. Much of that came from the recent acquisition of Baxalta, the hemophilia-focused company spun off of Baxter International (BAX), but Shire said its own legacy products grew 19%, while Baxalta's rose 12%.Profit jumped 29% to $3.38 a share. Both the top and bottom line beat consensus estimates.Shire's new full-year sales guidance was in line with consensus, but its EPS guide was on the upside. At the midpoint, it would represent 10% growth over last year.IBD'S TAKE: Shire and Pfizer both rank among the top 5 stocks in IBD's Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group. Shire's is No. 1 in EPS Rank, though its stock performance this year has been weaker than Pfizer's. For more info, see Shire's Stock Checkup.U.S. pharma giant Pfizer dropped 2.5% to 36.39 despite also notching a quarterly beat.

"
304,PFE,"There's a decent case to be made that investors' fear of Donald Trump winning the White House may turn out to be a good deal worse than the reality, at least in the intermediate term.Stock indexes crashed 5% overnight with odds for a December Federal Reserve hike tumbling. But after an initial modest sell-off at the open, the major averages have reversed for solid gains, with soaring bond yields.The overnight reaction to Trump looked like it may vindicate economists who predicted the market would fall up to 12% if Trump won. But once you consider Trump's near-term priorities and the challenges of working with Congress — even a GOP Congress restrained by a filibuster in the Senate — the agenda looks more market friendly than unfriendly.Priority one for Trump on the domestic front is likely to be revving up growth via infrastructure spending, cutting the corporate tax rate and offering multinationals the chance to repatriate overseas profits at a lower tax rate.He's talked about spending $1 trillion on infrastructure, double what Hillary Clinton proposed to spend, with both candidates talking up the potential of public-private partnerships.""With the focus on infrastructure, the basic resources sector is one of the best performers today,"" wrote Alastair George, chief strategist at Edison Investment Research in London.Both Nucor (NUE) and Steel Dynamics (STLD) surged on the stock market today, suring 12% and 9%, respectively. Shares of gold miner Newmont Mining (NEM) initially spiked as Trump's victory fueled a safe-haven bid with the dollar plunging. But as stocks and the dollar rebound, gold erased its big gains and Newmont traded 2% higher.IBD'S TAKE: Gold prices are rising sharply Wednesday. That will give a big boost to Newmont and other gold mining stocks, which are technical turning points.Biotech and drug stocks such as Pfizer (PFE) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) rallied on relief that Hillary Clinton will not be president and the Senate will remain in GOP hands. Clinton had vowed to crack on ""excessive"" price increases, notably on older treatments. She also likely would have pushed for the government to negotiate drug prices lower.Trump's victory means that regulatory relief for super-regional banks from Dodd-Frank regulations may go a step further than expected, paving the way for a round of acquisitions. It also may ease pressures on too-big-to-fail banks, which explains why Wells Fargo (WFC) popped 6% intraday, recovering from an overnight sell-off. Wells Fargo also may see less political pressure over its fradualent account scandal.""We expect a positive snapback move once investors digest the results and factor in a more favorable regulatory environment for the financial sector,"" wrote Brian Gardner, head of Washington research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.Banks have been rising in part due to expectations for a Fed hike amid stronger wage growth and tighter labor markets. While the Fed may decide to pause before hiking if Trump's election does send financial shock waves around the globe, that's far from clear.""Expect an immediate market pullback, on fear, and then a pause,"" said Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. ""Should Mr. Trump be able to reduce the uncertainty around what policies he intends to pursue, it is quite possible markets will recover as the economic fundamentals in the U.S. remain sound.""Trump is likely to kill President Obama's overtime rule that's due to take effect in December that guarantees time-and-a-half pay for salaried workers earning up to $47,476 — about twice the current level. Wal-Mart (WMT) already raised pay for assistant store managers to $48,500 from $45,000, effective September, to avoid being liable for overtime, but many employers have been slower to adopt the change as Congress aims to delay it. Some, like Carrols Restaurant Group (TAST), whose 717 Burger King locations make it the Restaurant Brands International (QSR) chain's largest franchisee, have said they'll effectively demote their managers and make them punch the clock.The ObamaCare employer mandate is likely history, meaning modest-wage employers would no longer be fined if they fail to offer health insurance to workers clocking at least 30 hours per week. Along with retailers, Trump may bring relief to restaurant chains like McDonald's (MCD) that are being squeezed by competition and compensation hikes, contributing to a record gap between the cost of fast food and eating in.What are markets scared about? Trump's threats to impose tariffs on companies like Ford Motor (F) that send cars to the U.S. from Mexico, to walk away from Nafta and to crack down on unauthorized immigrants are why economists have said his agenda could hurt the economy.If Trump were to start his presidency by labeling China a currency manipulator and imposing tariffs, that could start a trade war, with China reciprocating by targeting the sales of Apple (AAPL), General Motors (GM) and Microsoft (MSFT). China, facing slower growth and an unsustainable build up in debt, could easily spark another bout of financial market turmoil as was seen this past January.How Trump proceeds on trade will be one of his most important early decisions. The good news is that Trump isn't campaigning anymore — and his was an especially insular campaign. Surrounded by pro-growth economic advisors and now in direct contact with top business leaders, Trump is likely to act deliberately, not rashly. That may mean opening up talks with both countries about how to move trade relations forward and setting out intermediate term goals to measure progress.This seems consistent with Trump's victory speech words: ""I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone — all people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility; partnership, not conflict.""Trump seems unlikely to back down from his pledge to build a wall on the border with Mexico, but that, in and of itself, would have more of a symbolic than an economic effect. His rhetoric has shifted to cracking down on unauthorized immigrants who are violent criminals, and there may be fewer of those than he implies.RELATED:Drug Stocks Rally On Relief Clinton Didn't Win White HouseTrump Wins, But Fed Hike Still On: Treasury Yields, Bank Stocks SoarAT&T, Time Warner Fall After Trump Victory; Is Merger In Doubt?Overtime Rule Fallout: Fast Food Managers Told To Punch ClockFBI Reveals More Evidence That Stocks Will Fall If Trump Wins

305,PFE,"U.S. stocks were nearly flat in morning trade Friday as the market digested a mixed report on payrolls.The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 rose 0.1% each, but the small cap Russell 2000 rebounded almost 0.5%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average slipped less than 0.1%. Volume in the stock market today was running up in the Nasdaq and down in the NYSE.Starbucks (SBUX) began the session with a 1.8% drop but then reversed to a 3.5% gain. Volume was very heavy.The company reported quarterly results after Thursday's close. Revenue topped expectations by less than 1%. Earnings checked in 9% below the adjusted estimate, according to William O'Neil + Co. data. Other sources adjusted the earnings differently, which lead to an earnings beat.Starbucks' same store sales were unimpressive, but bulls liked the results on mobile business. About 6% of transactions in the U.S. came through advance mobile orders.In the IBD 50, losers led winners by a 3-to-2 ratio. Losers owned the Big Cap 20 by a 3-to-1 ratio.On the blue chip Dow, winners and losers were evenly split. Drugmaker Pfizer (PFE) led with a 1.3% gain. Chevron (CVX)  was the biggest loser in the Dow as the oil stock dropped 0.6%.West Texas intermediate crude oil fell about 2% to under $44 a barrel.In economic news, nonfarm payrolls for October rolled in at 161,000, which was about 10% worse than expected. However, the September number was revised upward to 191,000, which was about 22% better than expected.
"
306,PFE,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) stock bounded Friday on a 42-cent Q3 earnings beat, but shares are largely muzzled on a pending court decision pitting Regeneron and Sanofi (SNY) against No. 1 biotech Amgen (AMGN).In the stock market today, Regeneron stock rose 1.6% to 341.39, earlier rising as much as 4.7%. Shares, though, are down 37% this year, and IBD's 241-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group has fallen 29% amid the volatile election season high high-drug-prices controversies.Several disruptors in 2017 could rout Regeneron's stock, RBC analyst Adnan Butt wrote in a research note.Regeneron and Sanofi are awaiting a Delaware court's decision after Amgen filed a lawsuit saying their cholesterol drug, Praluent, violated its patent on Repatha. Both are PCSK9 inhibitors (Pfizer (PFE) just ended development on a similar drug). In its suit, Amgen is asking that Praluent be taken off the shelves.IBD'S TAKE: The SPDR S&P Biotech ETF jumped on Regeneron's Q3 earnings beat and Alexion Pharmaceuticals' continued Q3 wave. To get your feet wet in ETFs, visit the ETFs and Funds page.Good data from rivals Ophthotech (OPHT) and Novartis (NVS), which is working on a phase 3 trial for Fovista, could also be painful for Regeneron, Butt noted. Fovista, a drug to combat wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), would compete with Regeneron's bread-and-butter drug Eylea.During Q3, Eylea pulled in $854 million in sales, up 16% vs. the year-earlier quarter. That edged views for $853 million, and Regeneron raised the low end of its 2016 U.S. Eylea guidance. It now sees 23%-25% growth over 2015, which would be about $3.29 billion to $3.45 billion in sales.Praluent came in with $38 million vs. $40 million from Amgen's Repatha. That was in line with the consensus, Butt wrote. For the year, the consensus expects $135 million in Praluent sales. Sanofi reimbursement for Praluent is expected to dip $5 million at the high end of guidance.Early Friday, Regeneron posted $3.13 earnings per share ex items on $1.22 billion in sales for Q3, up 9.8% and 7.3%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. EPS topped the consensus of 25 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $2.71, but sales missed the $1.29 billion expectation.Updated guidance implies Regeneron will end 2016 with $10.89-$12.19, Evercore analyst John Scotti estimated in a report. That would be down 4.4% at the midpoint.RELATED:Align, Incyte, GrubHub Among Best R&D Stock Plays: Goldman Sachs
"
307,PFE,"Shares of drug giant Pfizer (PFE) fell Tuesday after the company said it would end development of a cholesterol-lowering drug projected to be a blockbuster, reduced its earnings outlook for the current quarter and posted Q3 EPS that just missed Wall Street expectations.Pfizer stock fell 2.1% to 31.06 in the stock market today. The member of the Dow Jones 30 industrials is trading at a nearly seven-month low, after touching a 12-year high above 37 on Aug. 1.Ceasing work on the injection drug, called bococizumab, was unexpected. The company said it proved to have unexpected side effects and was becoming less effective.Wall Street had modeled $1.5 billion in peak annual sales for bococizumab, Evercore ISI analyst John Scotti said in a note to clients. ""PFE was clear that they do not see this attenuation of benefit in competitive data"" from Amgen (AMGN) and Regeneron (REGN), he wrote. The problem ""appears to be bococizumab specific,"" Scotti said.IBD'S TAKE: Pfizer's megadeal to buy Allergan went bust in April. Could AT&T's $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner go the same direction?For Q3, the drugmaker said revenue rose 8% from the year-earlier quarter, to $13.05 billion, while earnings per share inched up 2% to 61 cents. Revenue met views, but EPS missed by a penny, according to Evercore ISI analyst John Scotti.For 2016, Pfizer now guides to EPS of $2.38-$2.43, down from its earlier guidance of $2.38-$2.48, and to sales of $52 billion-$53 billion, vs. earlier guidance of $51 billion-$53 billion.Pfizer attributed the miss to higher-than-expected COGS, cost of goods sold, tied to foreign exchange rates, Scotti said. Sales of breast cancer drug Ibrance were ""marginally below consensus,"" Scotti said, but ""Prevnar delivered a small beat."" Sales of Prevnar, a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, missed forecasts in Q2.""Our Innovative Health business executed strongly behind the latest product launches, and our two recent acquisitions — Medivation and Anacor — are providing new near-term opportunities to potentially drive incremental growth for the business as its product pipeline continues to mature,"" Pfizer CEO Ian Read said in the earnings release. ""We see this business as highly focused on those therapeutic areas where it is best positioned to deliver value to patients.""By maintaining our overall high level of financial flexibility and discipline, we are in a strong position to support the strategic initiatives for each business and will remain opportunistic to business development activity in addition to continuing to actively manage our cost structure.""In August, Pfizer announced its agreement to acquire Medivation, maker of prostate cancer drug Xtandi, for $14 billion. This came after New York-based Pfizer and Ireland-based Allergan (AGN) in April called off their planned merger, which would have been the industry's largest ever, after U.S. regulators set up roadblocks to so-called tax-inversion mergers, where U.S. companies looked to set up headquarters in lower-tax regions such as Ireland.In September, Pfizer said it would not split into two separate companies, a move it had mulled for several years. It had been expected to separate its Essential Health business, consisting of older, off-patent medications, and its Innovative Health business, which is dedicated to newer drugs.RELATED:Surprise Twist: Pfizer Won't Split UpLilly, AbbVie Lead 2017 Rankings, Pfizer Challenged

309,PFE,"The drug industry's Q2 earnings season launches this week with three of its biggest names: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) , Novartis (NVS) and Biogen (BIIB). Their broad portfolios could give investors a preview of how the business in general is doing.The big kahuna, Johnson & Johnson, on Tuesday morning is expected to report 1% year-over-year sales growth, but a modest decline in EPS to $1.68 a share. The stock hit a record high intraday Friday and is up 20% for the year. Credit ""strong pharma trends, and flight to safety and yield,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro in his July 8 preview note.Analysts are expecting another good quarter for J&J's pharma business; Novarro wrote that based on prescription data from IMS Health (IMS), four of J&J's biggest drugs -- Remicade, Imbruvica, Invokana and Xarelto -- will beat consensus. Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan, in his July 10 preview, lowered his estimates for Invokana while raising them for Remicade and Xarelto. But he said he was concerned about the entry of cheaper biosimilar versions of Remicade later this year. Pfizer's (PFE) Remicade biosimilar was approved by the FDA in April.IBD'S TAKE: Most drug stocks have taken a pounding this year, but J&J has proved to be the exception. Last month our Stock Market Today column highlighted it as one of three standout defensive Dow stocks, and it's only gone higher since then.Biosimilars will also probably be a topic of discussion on Novartis' Q2 conference call, also Tuesday morning. On Wednesday, the Swiss drug giant's biosimilar version of Amgen's (AMGN) Enbrel won unanimous backing from an FDA advisory panel, making it likely to be Novartis' second biosimilar launch after its version of Amgen's Neupogen entered the market last year.Investors will also likely be interested in the performance of Novartis' two newest potential blockbuster drugs, Cosentyx for psoriasis and Entresto for heart failure. Both are first-in-class drugs that were approved in the U.S. last year, though Entresto so far has missed expectations while Cosentyx has enjoyed stronger uptake.Cosentyx also faced new competition in Q2, however, as Eli Lilly (LLY) launched a drug in the same class called Taltz.On Monday, Credit Suisse analysts cut their Q2 EPS estimate by 4% because the launches of the two drugs appear to be costing more than they'd expected. However, they wrote that the long-term outlook for the drugs look good, estimating $5 billion in peak annual Entresto sales. Peak Cosentyx estimates have been running about the same.Analysts expect that, as in Q1, Novartis' Q2 financials will suffer from the loss of patent protection for its leukemia drug Gleevec. Sales are seen falling 3% to $12.3 billion, with earnings down 6% to $1.18 a share.Novartis' stock is slowly recovering from a long slide from its July 20, 2015, peak of 106.84 to its April 1 low of 69.90. Shares found support at the 50-day line and in recent weeks has moved just above their 200-day, closing Friday at 81.61.On Thursday before the open, Biogen is expected to report a quarter of stronger growth but lower expectations, as its multiple-sclerosis franchise has missed expectations over the last several reports.Nonetheless, RBC analyst Michael Yee sees potential upside for its MS drug Tecfidera, and he expects Biogen to raise its 2016 EPS guidance ""from current $18.30-18.60 EPS up more toward consensus around $19, depending on expense cuts."" That would represent a significant improvement over last year's $17.01.For Q2, analysts estimate that earnings grew 11% to $4.69 a share, while revenue gained 8% to $2.8 billion.Biogen stock, after crashing last July, has been trading above and below its still-sliding 50-day line for most of the months since. Biogen did close above its 50-day line on Friday. Aside from a brief late May-early June stint, Biogen has not been above its 200-day for nearly a year.

310,PFE,"Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) stock crashed to a two-year low Monday after competitor Merck (MRK) unveiled Phase 3 results showing lung-cancer drug Keytruda is twice as effective as chemotherapy, sparking its stock to a breakout.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Bristol-Myers Squibb stock plunged 10.1% to end trading at 49.81.Merck stock, on the other hand, lifted as much as 3.3% to a 15-year high near 65, and ended Monday trading up 1.8% to 63.90. Shares briefly hit a 64.10 entry point out of a flat base, adding to a 19% gain since January. New buys, though, are risky in the current volatile market environment.IBD'S TAKE: Merck stock is in a buy zone, but it's far from alone. Check out IBD's Stocks Near Buy Zone to find out which players are recommended bets.Shares ramped on Merck's presentation at the 2016 European Society of Medical Oncology conference in Copenhagen. There, Merck unveiled the results of Phase 3 testing for Keytruda, a drug to treat non-small cell lung cancer.Keytruda, alone, extended progression-free survival to 10.3 months vs. six months with chemotherapy for lung cancer patients expressing a specific type of protein, Merck said.Merck also combined Keytruda with Eli Lilly's (LLY) chemo drug Alimta. In that study, 55% of patients responded to the combination vs. 29% of patients receiving chemo. Median progression-free survival was 4.1 months longer on the combo.Bristol-Myers Squibb's nivolumab, a rival treatment for lung cancer, showed ""virtually no benefit,"" Evercore ISI analyst John Scotti wrote in a research report. That ""left investors scratching their heads,"" he said.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan expects Merck to take a major leadership position in the lung-tumor market vs. Bristol-Myers, AstraZeneca (AZN) and Roche (RHHBY). Though, he says, Roche might pile on some pressure with its Tecentriq.Tecentriq has shown an overall survival benefit in second-line lung cancer regardless protein expression, he wrote. He estimates $3 billion in peak sales with a 60% probability of success.RBC analyst Michael Yee expects Celgene (CELG) to fly on the potential for chemo-combos like the one Merck tested with Keytruda. He sees Celgene growing its revenue if only 30% of the first-line lung cancer patients are treated with chemo-combos.In other news from the conference, Credit Suisse's Divan expects Novartis (NVS) to face some pressure post-ESMO. Novartis' drug to combat metastatic breast cancer is as effective as Pfizer's (PFE) Ibrance, but has some serious safety concerns.""While efficacy appears in line with Ibrance, safety observations of Hy's law (risk of fatal drug-induced liver injury) and QTc prolongation (mild cardiac arrhythmia) may put the drug at a disadvantage to Pfizer's Ibrance or Eli Lilly's Abemaciclib, which may be approved in 2017,"" he wrote.Novartis stock lost 0.7% to end Monday trades at 77.75.Bristol-Myers, Eli Lilly, AstraZeneca, Roche, Pfizer, Novartis and Merck are in IBD's ethical drugs industry group. The group has been slumping, ranked No. 142 out of 197.RELATED:Celgene's Trio Of New Drugs Could Tack On $3 Billion-Plus: RBCAmgen, Biogen, Gilead Could Spike VA Pricing To Skirt California MeasureRoche Drug Scores In Lung Cancer, Challenging Bristol-Myers

311,PFE,"Eli Lilly (LLY) aims to take another bite out of the animal-health market, buying a unit of Germany's Boehringer Ingelheim, which itself is acquiring Sanofi's (SNY) animal-health business.Zoetis (ZTS), spun out of Pfizer (PFE) in 2013, is the No. 1 animal-health company, but Boehringer likely will become No. 2, Evercore ISI analyst John Scotti said in an email to clients Wednesday, and Lilly's Elanco unit will get bigger.Lilly stock rose a fraction in the stock market today, while Zoetis stock fell a fraction, to 52.18. Zoetis stock has been forming a flat base, with a possible buy point of 52.71.Lilly agreed to pay $885 million for Boehringer's Vermedica unit, which includes common vaccines for dogs, cats and other animals, as well as an Iowa manufacturing site. These include common vaccines for bordetella, parvovirus and rabies. Zoetis sells rabies, and other, vaccines for cats and dogs.Scotti said he spoke with Lilly representatives, who said the Boehringer vaccine portfolio, with the deal expected to close early next year, would generate about $200 million in annual revenue, about 5% of Elanco's total sales. Elanco accounted for 16% of Lilly's 2015 revenue. Lilly bought the animal-health division of Novartis (NVS) in early 2015.Scotti said Lilly indicated it will maintain its operating profit margin target of high 20s-30% by 2020, up from about 19% last year. He says Zoetis has targeted about 34% for its operating margin by 2020, where it's currently above 30%.""Coupled with our robust food animal portfolio, this addition further strengthens Elanco's position in the global animal health business,"" Lilly CEO John Lechleiter said in the company's press release.Boehringer said in June it would sell the Vermedica unit, as antitrust regulators reviewed its acquisition of Sanofi's animal-health business.IBD'S TAKE: Lilly and Zoetis are in IBD's 44-company Medical-Ethical Drugs group, which ranks just No. 137 out of 197 groups tracked. Still, within the group, Zoetis ties Depomed with the highest Composite Rating, at 83. CR is a broad measure of performance, looking at key metrics such as earnings and sales growth. Above 80 is good, but in general you should target companies with CR ratings in the 90s.RELATED:Zoetis Among Companies On Radar Of The Janus Forty Fund ManagersLilly Upgraded On Potential For Alzheimer's Drug

312,PFE,"The biggest breakup in drug industry history isn't happening.Pfizer (PFE) won't split in half, after years of what the pharmaceutical giant called an ""extensive evaluation."" The decision follows the collapse of Pfizer's attempted $160 billion merger with Allergan (AGN) this year, a deal that would have shifted the company's tax address overseas and bulked up units before a split. In recent months, New York-based Pfizer had signaled it might stay together.""By operating two separate and autonomous units within Pfizer we are already accessing many of the potential benefits of a split -- sharper focus, increased accountability, and a greater sense of urgency -- while also retaining the operational strength, efficiency and financial flexibility of operating as a single company,"" Chief Executive Officer Ian Read said in a statement.The question now is what's next for the biggest drugmaker in the U.S. Pfizer, in the statement, said it is ""poised to grow"" both businesses, and the drugmaker most recently agreed to a $14 billion deal to acquire Medivation (MDVN) and its cancer treatments.Investors have been waiting for a decision since 2012, when a Goldman Sachs analysts suggested the company should. Soon after, Pfizer began reorganizing its business into what eventually became two distinct units -- one cash-generating business with older and off-patent medicines, and another growth-focused operation with products dependent on more recent research and development.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks have been among the healthier stocks in recent weeks, and takeover talk has been a key factor. Amgen and Biogen are among the most likely buyers as investors see a slew of potential takeover targets.The shares fell 1.2 percent to 33.85 at 8:49 a.m. ET on the stock market today. Pfizer's stock has gained 52 percent since March 2012, when the drugmaker indicated at a meeting with Goldman Sachs analysts that it may be willing to consider a breakup. That's comparable to the 53 percent increase in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index in the same period, but well below the 96 percent jump in the S&P Health Care Sector Index.The decision doesn't affect the financial guidance for 2016, which Pfizer reaffirmed. Both units have delivered solid year-over-year performance over the course of the past three years, demonstrating their ability to compete on a standalone basis, Pfizer said.

313,PFE,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has a message for doctors: The money you're taking from pharmaceutical companies may be clouding your judgment.Research sites where drug behemoth Pfizer (PFE) had paid doctors at least $25,000 in speaking, consulting or other fees reported sunnier results for its smoking-cessation drug Chantix, the FDA disclosed Monday. At those sites, doctors studying the drug's possible link to suicide risk and other behavior changes reported fewer side effects than at locations where colleagues accepted lower or no payments.The FDA's findings -- part of an agency review of Pfizer's proposal to drop the most severe consumer warning on the drug's label -- demonstrate the federal government's concern about the influence of consulting and speaking fees on medical decisions.President Obama's 2010 health law requires drugmakers to report such payments for posting to a public database. The law followed years of efforts by U.S. Senator Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, to make drugmakers publicly disclose financial ties to doctors.James Rusnak, chief development officer for Pfizer's cardiovascular and metabolic unit, said the Chantix study was blinded, meaning that doctors who helped conduct it didn't know whether patients were getting a drug or a placebo. Any doctors who might have downplayed side effects would have done so across the board and thus wouldn't affect the final outcome, he said.""The idea of blinded study is to remove bias,"" Rusnak said in an interview. ""Even if you have payments and even if those payments bias the investigators in favor of your drug, the investigator has no idea which is your drug. They can only guess.""IBD'S TAKE: Pfizer shares hit an all-time intraday high of 37.39 on Aug. 1 and subsequently dropped in earnings. It's now trading around 34. Shire (SHPG) leads the drug group now while Pfizer is ranked eighth by IBD. To get a stock checkup on Pfizer, click here.Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Center for Health Research, part of a coalition of consumer and other groups that petitioned to keep the warning on Chantix, said the FDA staff report shows that it doesn't trust the ""integrity of the data.""""FDA clearly seems to be saying we can't trust the results of this study -- the way it was coded, the way it was analyzed, and by the way there's conflicts of interest,"" Zuckerman said.Outside experts are scheduled to meet Wednesday to advise the FDA about the necessity of the warning on Chantix. The pill's ""black box"" label -- the agency's strongest -- currently cites risk of ""serious neuropsychiatric events"""" such as suicidal thoughts or behavior. Chantix generated $671 million in sales last year, according to Pfizer.In the FDA staff report, the agency offered an unusually pointed assessment of the payments and their relationship to doctors' findings in the study. At two sites, the agency reported that doctors got ""as many as 60 separate honoraria for speaking engagements and consulting fees.""In sites where doctors received $25,000 or more from Pfizer, according to the FDA, only 1.8% of patients who had already been diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder were reported to have side effects, such as anxiety, agitation, hostility or suicidal thoughts, during the study. At locations where physicians received less money or none at all, 6.4% of patients reported such problems.The agency wasn't immediately able to provide exact details on what all of the payments were for, and the FDA staff report doesn't name the doctors who received payments.""The FDA routinely reviews the financial involvement of investigators at clinical trial sites for all applications,"" Michael Felberbaum, a spokesman for the agency, said in an email. ""On a case-by-case basis, the agency does additional analyses to evaluate whether there is an impact in study outcomes.""

315,PFE,"Drugmakers Roche (RHHBY), Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE) will likely disappoint on 2017 guidance, but AbbVie (ABBV) stock remained a ""top pick,"" Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford said in a Friday research report rundown ahead of Q4 earnings.On the stock market today, AbbVie stock fell 0.4% to 61.15. IBD's 44-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group fell 0.9%. Both fell below their 50-day moving averages this week.AbbVie is facing pressure as Amgen (AMGN), the No. 1 biotech by market cap, preps to deploy a Humira biosimilar. AbbVie's Humira, one of the world's top-selling drugs, is used to treat an array of diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.AbbVie's patents protecting dosing schemes for Humira are set to be deliberated in court Feb. 16. A patent on administering 40-milligrams of the D2E7 antibody every 13-15 days is set to expire June 2022. But that patent will likely be upheld, barring entrants like ""first-filer"" Amgen, Holford said.IBD'S TAKE: Though low on Holford's totem pole, Merck stepped alongside Eli Lilly and Biogen in 2016, each delivering two new drug approvals. Who else curried FDA support in 2016? Head to IBD's Industry Themes for more.""We see the 135 patent as a blocking patent for all potential Humira biosimilars in the U.S., given that it is assumed that all biosimilars must be developed to be dosed at the same concentration and frequency,"" he wrote.In a worst-case scenario, Amgen could launch a Humira biosimilar in mid-2018, which assumes the ""first filer"" doesn't launch at risk in 2017. Holford sees a $4 per share downside should a Humira biosimilar launch in 2018, given consensus expectations for a launch in 2019.Behind AbbVie, Holford lists Novartis (NVS), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and AstraZeneca (AZN) as strong picks. Pfizer, Merck, Novo Nordisk (NOVO) and Sanofi (SNY) are on the opposite end of Holford's list. But he expects disappointing guidance from nearly every big-cap drugmaker.""We expect disappointing 2017 guidance from the majority of U.S./EU large-cap pharma, with Roche, Novartis, Pfizer and AstraZeneca likely disappointing on revenue guidance and Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Merck and Roche also expected by us to disappoint on (earnings per share) guidance,"" he wrote.Upcoming catalysts include data from Roche's APHINITY trial examining its Perjeta regimen in HER2 positive breast cancer. Though Holford leans toward a positive outcome, ""we sense a high degree of uncertainty,"" he wrote.Merck's Keytruda in combination with Eli Lilly's (LLY) Alimta is also piquing investor interest. The combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy was granted priority review in first-line non-small cell lung cancer this month.Holford notes the FDA accepted the application on a small data set and, therefore, the combo is unlikely to see wide use. He also sees the consensus as too bullish on the combo and as undervaluing immunotherapy combinations from the likes of Bristol-Myers and AstraZeneca in first-line non-small cell lung cancer.RELATED:Gilead 2017 Outlook Hamstrung On Hep C, But RBC Bullish On Amgen, BiogenBristol-Myers Dives On Opdivo Setback, Will Get Keytruda RoyaltiesFDA Track Record Bodes Well For Merck Keytruda Plus Chemo: LeerinkTrump's 'Disastrous' Pharma View Doesn't Rattle JPMorgan Drug Conference

319,PFE,"An FDA panel unanimously endorsed Amgen's (AMGN) biosimilar version of AbbVie's (ABBV) blockbuster immunology drug Humira late Tuesday, making approval likely though it's not clear when it will launch.All 26 members of the panel endorsed approving Amgen's ABP 501 for all of the conditions it applied for, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, irritable bowel disease and ulcerative colitis. (Amgen did not apply for the most recent indications Humira had acquired, which include pediatric Crohn's disease and uveitis, since they're still covered by regulatory exclusivity.)Essentially, the panel found that there were no meaningful clinical differences between ABP 501 and Humira, though the two drugs are not identical.Humira is currently the world's best-selling drug, taking in some $14 billion worldwide last year, so AbbVie has been vigorously defending its intellectual property against Amgen and other challengers in court. Therefore, even though the FDA could approve ABP 501 by its Sept. 25 deadline, Amgen might not take the risk of launching it. If AbbVie prevails in its trials, Humira could be patent-protected into the 2020s.Amgen itself has been facing biosimilar competition to its drugs in Europe, and last summer Novartis' (NVS) Sandoz unit launched Zarxio, a version of Amgen's Neupogen that was the first biosimilar drug to be cleared in the U.S.On Wednesday, Novartis will go before an FDA panel itself to defend its biosimilar version of Enbrel, Amgen's flagship rheumatoid-arthritis drug.Analysts had expected approval of both the Amgen and Novartis biosimilars.""Given the broad support Pfizer (PFE)/Celltrion's biosimilar Remicade received at the FDA earlier this year and the data we have seen for both of these biosimilars, we expect similar levels of support for both biosimilars next week, although the ongoing legal process for both will likely be a better determinant of when we will see the biosimilars actually enter the market,"" wrote Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan in a research note last Wednesday.

323,PFE,"In an unexpected twist, Pfizer (PFE) decided against splitting up Monday, ending years of analyst speculation over what would have been one of the biggest corporate breakups in U.S. history.The decision follows ""an extensive evaluation"" and speculation that began in 2012 with Goldman Sachs' suggestion that Pfizer should consider a breakup, according to Bloomberg. The following year, Pfizer began reorganizing itself into what would become its Essential Health and Innovative Health business units.Pfizer stock closed down 1.8% at 33.64 on the stock market today, tugging down IBD's 44-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group, which fell 1.65%. Pfizer's $204 billion market cap makes it the second-largest company in the group behind $215 billion-valued Roche (RHHBY). Pfizer is trading near a three-month low of 33.55, touched Sept. 15, but shares hit a 12-year high of 37.39 on Aug. 1.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech M&A fodder is heading up, just one of the recent stories in the IBD Industry Themes column.But new tax rules in April forced Pfizer to scrap its $160 billion merger with Allergan (AGN). Under the new rules, Pfizer wouldn't have been allowed to shift its tax address overseas. Doing so would have helped Pfizer bulk up ahead of its expected breakup.Pfizer CEO Ian Read said Monday in a statement that Pfizer is already reaping the benefits of a split -- ""sharper focus, increased accountability and a greater sense of urgency — while also retaining the operational strength, efficiency and financial flexibility of operating as a single company.""Both its Innovative Health and Essential Health units have delivered three years of solid year-over-year performance, Pfizer said. In its August Q2 earnings announcement, Pfizer said Innovative Health sales rose 7% year over year and Essential Health grew 16%. Overall, Pfizer reported 11% growth in Q2 sales.""When we first explored the trapped value question several years ago, market valuations of other companies suggested that our two businesses could be worth more as separate companies than they are together in a single company,"" said Pfizer CFO Frank D'Amelio in a statement.Since then, that gap has closed, he said. Essential Health is focused on older, off-patent medications, where Innovative Health drives R&D spending for growth-oriented products. Pfizer expects the duo to become market leaders.To that end, it acquired Anacor for its Innovative unit and recently added Hospira and Innopharma to its Essential unit. It's working to close the acquisitions of Medivation (MDVN) and AstraZeneca's (AZN) small molecule anti-infective business.Pfizer reiterated its 2016 outlook. In 2017, it plans to begin giving guidance for indirect expenses incurred by its two business units.RELATED:Axovant Confidence 'Not Swayed' After Rival Alzheimer's Drug FailsLiver Disease Gets The Attention Of Several Major Biotech CompaniesAerie Pharmaceuticals Skyrockets On Eye Drug News

326,PFE,"President-elect Donald Trump, days before taking office, said that drugmakers are ""getting away with murder,"" slamming shares of drugmakers and biotechs such as Pfizer (PFE), Amgen (AMGN) and Biogen (BIIB). Meanwhile, in his first press conference in months, he said the costly Lockheed Martin (LMT) fighter jet F-35 shows the need for more competitive bidding. He also praised some automakers for U.S. investments.Trump said Wednesday that ""new bidding procedures"" are needed on drug prices, signaling his support for new legislation traditionally backed by Democrats and opposed by Republicans that could hit the sector's profits.""Our drug industry has been disastrous,"" he said. ""They're leaving left and right,'"" He also criticized the industry's heavy lobbying.""We're going to save billions of dollars over a period of time.""Trump had previously signaled the drug industry was in his sights, saying shortly after the presidential election that he is ""going to bring down drug prices.""Amgen shares fell 1.4% to close at 156.62 on the stock market today, with nearly all the decline coming after Trump's remarks. The biotech ETF IBB (IBB) tumbled 3% to 277.94, while Biogen lost 3.6% to 287.11. Pfizer fell 1.8% to 32.83.The overall stock market changed direction several times in volatile trade following Trump's remarks. After falling initially, the Dow Jones industrial average ended up climbing 0.5%. The same was true for the other major indexes as the Nasdaq finished 0.2% in the black while the S&P 500 gained 0.3%.Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin fell 0.4% intraday. Trump said that he would have competition for fighter jets that would bring down costs significantly. Trump has previously ripped the F-35's costs and called on Boeing (BA) to price out an F/A-18 Super Hornet as a possible replacement.Trump praised Ford Motor (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) for their recent planned investments in the U.S. Ford fell 1.4% to 12.67, largely holding prior losses, while Fiat Chrysler climbed 2.6% to 11.09.RELATED:Trump Vows Fighter-Jet Competition, 'Big Things' On Lockheed F-35Biotech ETFs Dive After Trump Slams Drug Industry In First Presser

327,PFE,"Stocks gave up some gains in early afternoon trading Thursday. Hunger for blue chips seemed to increase as the Dow Jones industrial average paced the gains among the popular indexes.The Dow Jones industrial average was up 0.6%, adding to its 2.7% advance claimed over the prior four sessions. The 30-component blue chip index is now up 6% year to date. The Nasdaq composite, up 0.4% Thursday afternoon, has climbed 3.5%.Oil, steel, banking, fertilizer, railroad and semiconductor stocks helped hoist the S&P 500 0.3% higher. Volume is running higher on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE.The Dow Jones industrial average seemed to relish its role as a perennial laggard since the market's bottom in October of 2011. While the index posted an impressive gain of 76% to a peak of 18,288 in March 2015, it paled vs. the Nasdaq composite's 128% run over roughly the same period of time.However, the individual action among stocks in the Dow continues to get better. Take the health care sector. Pfizer (PFE) is acting like a big-cap leader lately. The Big Pharma play rose 1% to 36.67, up 3% from a 10-month saucer with handle.Notice how in the three-week-long handle, which began on June 10, the stock pulls back lightly and volume dries up in most of the sessions. That's ideal action as a stock sets up a potential breakout, which in Pfizer's case took place on July 1. While volume was quiet on the breakout, IBD research has found that in some cases, volume may come in strong a few weeks into the move toward new highs.Wall Street seems convinced that Pfizer has returned to a growth track, as Q2 profit is seeing rising nearly 11% to 62 cents a share on a 9% pickup in sales to $12.94 billion. This week, the ethical drug giant reportedly closed a deal to sell medicines in the Russian market and also got a label extension for its Prevnar vaccine for pneumonia. Doctors may now prescribe the vaccine to adults under 50 years old.Also in the Dow, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and insurer UnitedHealth Group (UNH) are acting well after recent breakouts. The former is flat at 123, extended from a recent breakout past a 115.10 buy point. Its Relative Price Strength line has been rising since June, indicating that J&J has been outperforming the S&P 500.UnitedHealth is down 0.6% intraday, but at 140.60 the stock remains above a 135.21 flat-base entry. In a flat base, the decline from head to toe must not exceed 15%. UnitedHealth's five-week flat base features a very mild 5% drop, indicating a reluctance among institutional investors to sell shares.The 5% buy zone extends up to 141.97 for UnitedHealth. The company earns a respectable 89 Composite Rating out of a maximum 99 on IBD Stock Checkup, second only to managed care industry peer Centene (CNC).Johnson & Johnson and United Health report earnings next week.Fellow Dow stock JPMorgan Chase (JPM) gapped up, leading the money center banks with a 1.7% gain to 64.21. Volume is running more than double normal levels. The Wall Street bank posted a 1% rise in Q2 profit, beating analysts' consensus view, as revenue lifted 5% to $26.8 billion. CEO Jamie Dimon earlier this week announced plans to raise minimum pay for a large number of the bank's employees.The stock still needs work on building the right side of a potential new base. JPMorgan's 44 RS Rating lags those of Pfizer (73), UnitedHealth (81) and J&J (86).Among IBD 50 names in the stock market today, data center operator CoreSite Realty (COR) cooled off for a third day in a row, down 1.5% to 84.55, as investors appeared to cash in more gains in dividend-paying REITs. Nursing and physician staff outsourcer AMN Healthcare (AHS), the highest ranking medical name on the IBD 50, jumped nearly 2% to 43.59 in dull turnover. The stock has risen more than 30% past a 33.40 handle entry on a long double-bottom base. In general, at least some profits should be taken when a stock rises 20% to 25% past a proper pivot point.As seen in Wednesday's Big Picture column and Market Pulse table, the market is currently in a confirmed uptrend. This means an investor has a higher probability of making money when buying breakouts of high-quality growth stocks at proper buy points. The market followed through on June 30.Is your stock is best in class within its industry group in terms of profit growth, margins, sales, return on equity, institutional fund sponsorship and relative price strength?

328,PFE,"General Electric (GE) acquired Swiss-based Biosafe Group, a supplier of tools for the cell therapy development and products industry, as biotechs Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), Kite Pharma (KITE) look to capitalize on new approaches to fighting cancer.Terms of the Biosafe deal weren't disclosed. Biosafe says on its website that it's active in ""the growing field of adult stem cell therapy, serving stem cell banks, hospitals and research institutes alike with innovative cell processing solutions."" Its products include Sepax, a system that is involved in preparing cellular products for clinical use.The cell therapy oncology market alone is estimated to reach $30 billion by 2030, GE said in a statement, and the industrial conglomerate seeks to build a $1 billion position in the cell therapy field.GE shares closed up 0.3% at 32.36 in the stock market today. Juno jumped 9.5% and Kite rallied 3.3%.IBD'S TAKE: GE is among of group of other diversified manufacturers whose stocks are in or nearing buy range.Juno Therapeutics, Kite Pharma, Pfizer (PFE) and Novartis (NVS) are among a group of companies planning to come to market with so-called CAR-T (chimeric antigen receptor T-cell) drugs.Last month, Juno shares sank after the FDA put on hold a late stage-study of a CAR-T drug due to the deaths of three patients involved in the study. But late Tuesday, the FDA allowed the trial to continue.The Biosafe acquisition expands GE Healthcare's end-to-end portfolio of products and services for cell therapy customers. In April, GE Ventures and the Mayo Clinic launched Vitruvian Networks, an independent platform company aimed at accelerating access to cell and gene therapies through cloud-ready software systems.In January, GE announced the [email protected] Cell Therapy Center of Excellence, a $31.5 million co-investment with Canada's government to promote new cellular therapies technologies.

329,PFE,"With the S&P 500 ending Friday just one point below a record close, it's no surprise that the benchmark index has many stocks breaking out of consolidation. Here are the five biggest S&P 500 stocks that are in buy range: Facebook (FB), General Electric (GE), Verizon Communications (VZ), Pfizer (PFE) and Chevron (CVX). Except for Facebook, the stocks are all on the Dow Jones industrial average.Facebook rose 1.2% on Friday to 117.24, just retaking an old entry point of 117.09 as well as moving above its 50-day moving average. That buy point was initially cleared in late April, following Facebook's blowout Q1 earnings report. Facebook also is currently in a flat base pattern with another buy point available at 121.18, just above its May 11 all-time high.Friday's move came in below-average volume. You want to see breakouts come amid hefty buying, a sign of institutional interest.Despite Facebook's massive user base, the social network has continued to grow as mobile advertising booms. Facebook has reported three straight quarters of accelerating earnings growth, including an 83% EPS gain in Q1.Update: Facebook rose 0.5% to 117.87 in below-average volume on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Facebook is part of Leaderboard, IBD's premium service that highlights top-rated stocks at or near buy points.General Electric also rose 1.2% Friday, closing at 32.20, hitting an 8-year high and just passing its buy point at 32.15. Volume was slightly above normal.GE's Composite Rating is just 47, meaning that it outperforms only 47% of all stocks due to its rocky fundamentals. Q1 earnings rose 5%, but that followed five straight quarters of declines.Update: General Electric shares climbed 1 cent to 32.21 Monday after rising to 32.50 intraday.Verizon Communications broke out a cup base in late June with a 54.59 buy point. Since then shares have hit new highs, but have stayed within the 5% buying range. Verizon and fellow S&P 500 and Dow industrials member AT&T (T) benefited from a shift to defensive stocks in the initial wake of the U.K. vote to exit the European Union. As domestic-focused dividend kings, the telecom giants fit the bill. (AT&T shares are too extended for a proper entry right now).Update: Verizon rose 3 cents to 55.95.IBD's TAKE: For a look at several top-rated stocks breaking out in recent days, check out IBD's New Highs column.Pfizer on July 1 cleared 35.60 buy point in a long consolidation. Shares continued to nudge higher, closing at 36.12 on Friday, still well within buying range. Pfizer is closing in on its all-time high is 36.42 set on July 31, 2015.Pfizer has a 77 Composite Rating, solid but not spectacular. Earnings and sales have been spotty, but Q1 EPS rose 31% and analysts expect profit growth for 2016 and 2017.The pharma giant offers a quarterly payout of 30 cents a share, or $1.20 annualized, for a 3.4% yield.Another stock catalyst is a possible split into two or more companies.Update: Pfizer rose 3 cents to 36.15 Monday.Chevron has been trying to hold a buy point at 104.36 in a flat-base pattern, as well as a longer consolidation going back more than a year. Chevron has topped the entry area several times over the past month. On Friday, shares rose 1.7 % to 104.77, back above the buy point.Chevron reported an outright loss in the first quarter. Analysts expect profits for Q2 and Q3, with earnings growth returning in Q4.Energy stocks react strongly to crude prices. But even though U.S. oil prices fell more than 7 % last week, Chevron rose fractionally.Update: Chevron shares rose 0.6% to 105.39 Monday.

330,PFE,"Big biotech Amgen's (AMGN) biosimilar form of AbbVie's (ABBV) Humira seemed to get support from the FDA on Friday, when the agency released briefing documents for the advisory committee panel meeting on Tuesday.The panel will discuss ABP 501, a knockoff of AbbVie's mega-blockbuster used to treat several forms of arthritis, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, ulcerative colitis and ankylosing spondylitis. Since biosimilars, unlike generic pharmaceuticals, are not identical to the drugs they're copying, the approval process isn't as simple as for generics. But in the briefing documents, the FDA sounded convinced that Amgen had made its case.""In considering the totality of the evidence, the data submitted by Amgen support a demonstration that ABP 501 is highly similar to U.S.-licensed Humira, notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and support a demonstration that there are no clinically meaningful differences between ABP 501 and U.S.-licensed Humira in terms of the safety, purity and potency of the product to support the demonstration that ABP 501 is biosimilar to the U..S-licensed Humira in the studied indications of RA (rheumatoid arthritis) and PsO (psoriasis),"" said the document.Amgen shares climbed 2.9% to 161.10 on the stock market today. AbbVie, meanwhile, added 1.15%. Both Amgen and AbbVie shares are approaching 11-month highs.The FDA has until Sept. 25 to make its ultimate decision on approval, but that won't necessarily mean an immediate launch. Amgen and AbbVie are currently tied up in litigation over Humira's intellectual property, and while some generic drugmakers have launched ""at risk"" before such suits are settled, some wait for more certainty.""Recall, Amgen went through the patent dance with AbbVie, and AbbVie has said that they plan to file a public case against Amgen in the next few months and assert many patents,"" Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum wrote in an email to clients. ""If AbbVie were to file and subsequently win a preliminary injunction, Amgen would be barred from marketing either (1) until litigation completes if the biosimilar is ultimately found not to infringe, or (2) until the expiry of the infringed patent if AbbVie were granted a permanent injunction (thus at least 2022 depending on the patent).""Coherus Biosciences (CHRS), Novartis (NVS) and Pfizer (PFE) also have Humira biosimilars in development.Coherus stock rose 4.8% on Friday. Novartis advanced 0.4% and Pfizer 1%. Pfizer set a 12-year closing high.

"
332,PFE,"A so-so jobs report fueled modest selling on Wall Street Friday. New highs weren't hard to find, but several names faded after a strong start.Flex (FLEX), formerly known as Flextronics, eased 0.01 to 14.10 in light trade. It's near the high end of buy range from a 13.47 buy point. It's a low-priced stock but plenty liquid with an average daily volume of 3.6 million shares and a market capitalization of $7.6 billion. Flex provides electronics manufacturing services to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).Small cap Cabot Microelectronics (CCMP) is thinly traded, but it's got several positive qualities, including a Composite Rating of 93 and an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A-. Shares eased 0.21 to 53.70 in average turnover. The chip-equipment firm is holding just above a 53.01 flat-base entry.Coherent (COHR) lost 2.26 to 111.11 in light trade. It's trying to clear a base-on-base pattern with a 112.19 buy point. Coherent staged a base breakout in late July over a 98.59 buy point. Since it rallied less than 20%, its latest flat base is the second base in a base-on-base structure. Coherent operates in two segments: Specialty Lasers and Systems and Commercial Lasers and Components.BroadSoft (BSFT) slipped 0.35 to 47.49 in soft volume. A loss from a prior 47.60 entry recently hit 6% but didn't trigger a sell signal. That means the buy point is still in play. BroadSoft offers software as a service (SaaS), providing telecom customers with cloud-based communications technology.ICU Medical (ICU) extended gains after Thursday's bullish gap up in price. Shares rose another 4.97 to 149.65 in heavy volume on news the company bought Pfizer's (PFE) infusion therapy business, which includes infusion pumps and intravenous solutions, for $1 billion.

The Louisiana-based bank has a solid Composite Rating of 95, helped, in part, by a consistent track record of earnings and sales growth in recent quarters.
"
333,PFE,"Axovant Sciences (AXON) management was unconcerned Thursday after Danish rival Lundbeck failed a key hurdle in phase-three testing for its newest Alzheimer's treatment drug, following Pfizer's (PFE) departure from the market in February, RBC analyst Michael Yee said Friday.Lundbeck's idalopirdine would have rivaled Axovant's RVT-101 (intepirdine) to treat Alzheimer's. Both target receptors in patients' brains to facilitate acetylcholine release in the frontal cortex. Doing so improves cognition, memory and learning.Thursday, Axovant stock tanked as much as 29% to a two-month low on Lundbeck's failure before recovering somewhat to fall 12.5% at the close. On the stock market today, Axovant stock rose nearly 1%, to 15.28.Lundbeck, however, had changed the dosing scheme for its idalopirdine to once daily to cut down on liver toxicity concerns, a departure from phase two in which patients received 90 milligrams each day. In phase three, Lundbeck tested 10 milligrams, 30 mg and 60 mg.""Although idalopirdine was safe and tolerated in the Starshine trial, we believe today's news suggests that low-dose idalopirdine may not have enough efficacy to hit the primary endpoint in the remaining trials,"" Yee wrote in a research report late Thursday.Yee sees only a 25% to 35% chance that Lundbeck's drug will succeed, vs. his 60% prediction on Axovant's RVT-101. For phase three, Axovant plans to mirror the same 35-mg dosage and endpoints that reaped it success in phase two.Axovant is enrolling its phase-three trial and expects data on it in late 2017, Yee said.Axovan's confidence was ""not swayed"" by Lundbeck's failure, Evercore analyst Mark Schoenebaum wrote in a report. He says the company plans to file a new drug application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by the end of 2017.RVT-101 could be the first 5HT6 (a type of receptor in the brain) antagonist to receive approval, Yee says. He expects it to be a $5 billion opportunity for Axovant.Pfizer shuttered a study on an Alzheimer's drug after it failed in phase two.Yee also notes that Axovant has a second drug, nelotanserin, to treat dementia.Nelotanserin shares a similar mechanism of action with Acadia Pharmaceuticals' (ACAD) pimavanserin, which already has an FDA nod for treatment of psychosis associated with Parkinson's. Thus, nelotanserin is somewhat ""de-risked,"" Yee wrote.IBD'S TAKE: Axovant stock has a low IBD Composite Rating of 47, meaning it underperforms more than half of its rivals in terms of key growth metrics. The 420-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group is led by Supernus Pharmaceuticals, which has a best-possible CR of 99.

334,PFE,"A handful of leading stocks broke out to new highs or followed through on recent breakouts in the stock market today despite a narrowly mixed performance by the major market indexes.Lam Research (LRCX) gapped up and surged 4% Thursday, following through on its Wednesday breakout past a 95.87 flat-base buy point. Volume on Wednesday was 42% above average -- on Thursday, it swelled to 355% higher-than-normal trade.Investors were clearly not worried about the chip gear maker's breakup with KLA-Tencor (KLAC). Late Wednesday, the two companies dumped their planned $11 billion merger deal, citing antitrust concerns. Intel (INTC), Hitachi and Samsung were reportedly among companies opposing the potential union.""We believe that this proposed combination would have resulted in compelling benefits for our customers, employees and stockholders, as well as accelerate innovation in the broader semiconductor industry, so we are disappointed with the outcome,"" Lam CEO Martin Anstice said in a press release.Central Garden & Pet (CENTA) climbed past a 25.88 buy point intraday Thursday, but closed just below the entry. Volume was well below normal. The lawn and garden products maker marked a record high during the session.Cinemark Holdings (CNK) rose 2% to a 52-week high, clearing a 39.55 flat-base buy point in heavier-than-usual trade. The Plano, Texas-based company operates theaters in 41 U.S. states and in Latin American countries.ICU Medical (ICUI) vaulted 15% to a new high, breaking out past a 129.02 buy point in massive volume.  The stock is a bit thinly traded with an average daily volume of about 95,000 shares. The San Clemente, Calif.-based medical products maker is buying Pfizer's (PFE) infusion systems unit for $1 billion in cash and stock.RELATED:Lam Research, KLA-Tencor Scrap Chip Gear Deal On Antitrust Concerns

335,PFE,"Mylan's (MYL) half-price version of its EpiPen allergy shot may not be available until the end of the year, the drugmaker said in an email, potentially months after a timeline the company gave in August.The ""authorized generic"" version of EpiPen will be available ""by the end of the year,"" Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an email Monday.Five weeks ago, in a statement on Aug. 29, the company said it expected to introduce the generic version ""in several weeks."" Mylan's generic version will cost $300 for a two-pack, about half the brand-version price.""We expect to launch this year once we have assured that sufficient inventory will be available to meet anticipated orders, created the necessary packaging for the product, and created the necessary labeling for the product,"" Devlin said. ""We are diligently working to complete these efforts in order to provide the generic as soon as possible.""Mylan has attracted the wrath of Congress by increasing the list price of the EpiPen more than six-fold since 2007, to more than $600 for a package of two. To quell the growing furor over EpiPen's price, it announced the cheaper authorized generic version.Devlin declined to be any more specific about when the $300 generic version would be available.Drugmakers don't need advance approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to bring an authorized generic product to market, said Theresa Eisenman, an FDA spokeswoman. They do, however, have to notify the agency in an annual report.Pfizer (PFE), which manufacturers the brand version of EpiPen for Mylan, has not announced any manufacturing issue that could delay production of an authorized generic.Last month, at a hearing of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch faced skeptical lawmakers who grilled her over the drugmaker's profits and executive pay.At the hearing, she said Mylan makes $100 in profit on each pair of EpiPens. But in a Sept. 30 letter demanding more detailed information from Mylan, lawmakers said that figure included tax assumptions that may have underrepresented Mylan's profits.As of Monday's close, Mylan's shares were down 21% since Aug. 19, the last day of trading before lawmakers began questioning the drugmaker's EpiPen pricing. The stock dipped another 0.6% to 37.97 at the close Tuesday.

336,PFE,"Stocks continued to search for direction in early afternoon trade Wednesday, as President-elect Donald Trump sent biotechs and Lockheed Martin (LMT) down. The Nasdaq lagged as Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) pulled back.The Nasdaq shed 0.4%, the S&P 500 fell 0.3% and the Dow Jones industrial average was flat. Volume was tracking higher across the board vs. the same time Tuesday.Solar, oil and metals stocks led the upside in the stock market today, as West Texas intermediate oil futures surged 3% to $52.38 a barrel.Biotechs and other drugmakers got hammered after President-elect Donald Trump sharply criticized drug prices. Blue chip drug giant Pfizer (PFE) was the Dow's biggest loser, sliding 3% to lose its 200-day moving average in fast trade.But Merck (MRK) bucked the selloff, up 3% in healthy volume to lead Dow winners, though it pared gains from an earlier 5% pop. Shares are building a flat base with a 65.56 buy point. The Food and Drug Administration accepted a supplemental filing for Merck's immunotherapy Keytruda to be used with chemotherapy to treat advanced lung cancer.Apple, meantime, backed off 0.2% in weak trade. The stock has so far been unable to follow through on its Monday breakout past a 118.12 entry of a cup with handle, but remains in buy range.Nvidia, too, is hesitating as it attempts to recoup a 17% drop from late December to early January. As pointed out in a recent Stock Market Today column, the stock was due for a correction after a heady run-up from a March breakout. It's holding well above its 50-day line and its overall trend is higher.

337,PFE,"After rising for three consecutive years, the FDA's drug approval rate in 2016 plunged to a nine-year low despite Biogen (BIIB), Merck (MRK) and Eli Lilly (LLY) each adding two new drugs to their bailiwicks, according to Swiss biotech HBM Partners.The Food and Drug Administration approved 19 new molecular entities in 2016, down 51% from 45 in 2015 — a year that marked a decade-high for approvals NMEs, says HBM. There had not been fewer NMEs approved since 2007, when the FDA gave its blessing to just 17.About half those NMEs in 2016 (nine), were not fully developed in house. Five were acquired via M&A and four were in-licensed, HBM wrote.Of the 19 new drugs, nine (47%) were for ""first-in-class"" drugs. By therapeutic area, cancer led among NMEs. Four new drugs in 2016 — projected at an industry-leading $7.5 billion in peak sales — were in oncology, HBM found.IBD'S TAKE: Easing the FDA approval process could be part of Donald Trump's health care initiatives, but will the president-elect really break with Republicans to enact major drug reform?That's a trend. Over the past five years, oncology drugs saw a major increase on the FDA approval list. From 2012-16, 50 new cancer drugs were approved, rising from 24 NMEs in cancer from 2007-11.From 2012-16, the FDA had an increased appetite for drugs to treat diabetes, respiratory diseases, viral and other infections. Its interest in cardiovascular, genetic and immunology drugs increased moderately. But those years also saw fewer central nervous system drugs.Since then, Merck and Roche (RHHBY) have had more drugs approved than any other companies. Each added eight.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Pfizer (PFE) follow closely with seven apiece.Gilead Sciences (GILD), Novartis (NVS), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Sanofi (SNY) and Lilly have each added six new drugs.IBD's 420-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group closed down 1% on the stock market today. The group, ranked No. 47 out of 197, is up 3% in 2017 after tumbling 25% in 2016, as lawmakers debated the issue of drugs with steeply rising prices.RELATED:Lilly Regains Key Migraine Drug With $960 Million CoLucid AcquisitionFDA Track Record Bodes Well For Merck Keytruda Plus Chemo: LeerinkTrump's 'Disastrous' Pharma View Doesn't Rattle JPMorgan Drug Conference

338,PFE,"Biotechs have a lot riding on drug data in 2017.IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group plunged 25% in 2016 after a rocky election year. Relief that Hillary Clinton lost the White House spiked the group nearly 17% in the week following the election, but those gains have since dissipated on Donald Trump's pledge to tackle rising drug prices.The group has faced challenges at its 50-day moving average since April. Meanwhile, large caps like Amgen (AMGN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are trading at 10%-15% of their no-pipeline valuations, according to RBC analyst Michael Yee. Tugging sentiment out of its 12-month low will require either M&A or strong drug data.""M&A remains a potential coiled spring catalyst if one to two companies could go into play and many large pharmas continue to be on the hunt,"" Yee wrote in a Dec. 29 research report. He sees Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIA), Incyte (INCY), Tesaro (TSRO) and BioMarin (BMRN) as possible acquisition targets.Outside M&A, Yee said, there's a ""lack of material catalysts to get the sector moving.""IBD'S TAKE: Five top biotechs ended 2016 with triple-digit gains, outplaying the broader industry. Are your biotech picks on that list? Check out IBD's Industry Themes for the deeper dive.But nearly two dozen biotech companies this year are slated to post key drug trials data in just four key arenas: drugs to treat spinal muscular atrophy, drugs to treat cystic fibrosis, PARP inhibitors to treat several types of cancers and therapies to treat lymphoma.Success could turn sentiment positive for the second, but failure could weigh on many drug stocks.Spinal muscular atrophy — which results in the wasting away of muscle and can lead to early death — will see the least new data in 2017 of the four sectors, but it also will host what Yee, in a recent research report, calls the overall drug industry's ""only new real launch"" this year.Biogen (BIIB) and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) teamed up to develop Spinraza, the brand name for nusinersen, a drug that targets a single RNA to treat the symptoms of SMA, Ionis CEO Stanley Crooke told IBD in a recent Q&A.Biogen exercised its worldwide rights to Spinraza in August. The Food and Drug Administration approved Spinraza in late December. It's the first SMA treatment to get FDA approval and Crooke said he expects Biogen to bring the drug to market early this year.He describes SMA as a ""diabolical"" disease that chemically denervates the body. It can be fatal in infants and progresses in toddlers, robbing them of the ability to walk, eat or breathe on their own. It affects the motor nerve cells in the spinal cord, according to Cure SMA.After Spinraza's launch, midcap Cytokinetics (CYTK) is expected to release the results of a phase 2 trial on CK-2127107, which it describes as a ""novel skeletal muscle troponin activator"" that could help treat SMA patients and others suffering similar degeneration.CK-2127107 differs from Spinraza in that it aims to slow the rate of calcium release from the regulatory troponin complex of fast skeletal muscle fibers. It's in two phase 2 trials, one examining SMA patients and one looking at patients with chronic lung disease, with trial results for the latter further in the future.Cytokinetics is a lightly traded small cap, but has an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 79 out of a best-possible 99. The stock crept into a buy zone in late December, hitting a 12.65 entry point out of a cup-with-handle formation, but has slipped to 10.60 as of Thursday's close, triggering the sell rule anytime a stock falls at least 8% from a buy point Shares rose 16% in 2016.A handful of cystic fibrosis trials are expected to wrap up in 2017 — but Vertex's ""triple pill"" has sparked the most analyst chatter. Both Yee and Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan say phase 2 data for VX-152 and VX-440 are likely to be available in the latter half of 2017 and another trial's results out sooner.VX-152, VX-440 and VX-661 are being investigated as a three-prong treatment for cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease that causes mucus to collect, blocking the airways and damaging the digestive system. VX-661 is in phase 3 testing with results from two patient populations expected in the first half of the year.Yee estimates VX-152, VX-440 and VX-661 could add $1 billion to $2 billion in long-term sales for Vertex. He sees ""a fairly good chance the 'triple' will work in the second half of 2017, driving the company's growth. But, he notes that investors remain wary. Vertex stock fell 41% in 2016, but it is up 9.8% this year after falling 2% to 80.91 on Thursday.Vertex is far from alone in the cystic fibrosis game. As many as seven other publicly-traded biotechs are expected to release clinical trial data in 2017. Mid-cap biotech PCT Therapeutics (PCTC) appears furthest along, with phase 3 data for its Translarna due this quarter.The PCT trial examines CF patients with nonsense mutations. According to Cystic Fibrosis News, Translarna could potentially make the cellular protein machinery run the ""so-called stop sign in the CF-causing CFTR gene, replacing it with amino acids similar enough to allow the protein to do its work.""Clovis Oncology (CLVS) pulled ahead of Tesaro in late December when the FDA granted accelerated approval to its PARP inhibitor, rupacarib. A day later, the FDA gave Tesaro's PARP inhibitor, niraparib, priority review. The two are duking it out to rival Lynparza, a PARP inhibitor approved in 2014 from AstraZeneca (AZN).Both are deadlocked in a race to treat ovarian and breast cancer. Clovis is on track to unveil phase 3 data for rupacarib — which will sell under the brand name Rubraca — in patients with a BRCA-like mutation in the latter half of 2017. BRCA mutations are often associated with breast cancer.Tesaro's niraparib is on deck for phase 3 breast cancer and phase 2 ovarian cancer data in the second half of 2017. Niraparib has a Prescription Drug Free User (PDUFA) date of June 30, according to Biopharma Catalyst's FDA tracker.Niraparib, rupacarib and olaparib (the chemical name for AstraZeneca's Lynparza) belong to a class of drugs called PARP inhibitors. Several forms of cancer are dependent on PARPs, a type of enzyme. By inhibiting those enzymes, companies like Clovis, Tesaro and AstraZeneca hope to treat several cancers.AbbVie (ABBV) and Pfizer (PFE), via its acquisition of Medivation, also are working on PARP inhibitors.AbbVie's veliparib missed several endpoints, including progression-free survival (PFS), in a phase 2 trial of recurrent and metastatic breast cancer with BRCA mutations unveiled in early December. Phase 3 testing is underway. Veliparib is also being investigated as a treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Pfizer acquired Medivation for $14 billion in September. Medivation's talazoparib is in development to treat breast cancer with germ line BRCA mutations. But neither AbbVie nor Pfizer's PARP inhibitors are expected to have data in 2017.Ariad, Kite Pharma (KITE) and Seattle Genetics (SGEN) look poised to lead 2017 in the lymphoma battle — though as many as 10 publicly-traded biotechs are expected to present data this year on varying drugs.Next month, Kite's KTE-C19 will likely come away with ""solid"" six-month durability data in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), says RBC's Yee. That could lead to a rolling Biologics License Agreement (BLA) in Q1 and a PDUFA date before year-end.KTE-C19 belongs to a class of drugs called CAR T-cell therapies. These drugs teach a patient's immune system to fight off specific cancers. Kite's drug is being investigated as a treatment for refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma.Ariad Pharma, on the other hand, already has a PDUFA date of April 29 for its brigatinib, a treatment for anaplastic lymphoma kinase positive (ALK+) metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) resistant to crizotinib, a Pfizer chemotherapy.Though the PDUFA date is in April, first-line data won't be available until 2018-19. Competitor Roche (RHHBY) has similar data for a rival drug due in that same time frame. Ariad completed the New Drug Application (NDA) for brigatinib in October.Also in 2017, Seattle Genetics is angling for a fourth indication for its 2011-approved Adcetris. Adcetris is being examined as a treatment for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). It will also unveil the results of a yearlong phase 3 trial of Adcetris and chemotherapy in front-line Hodgkin lymphoma.Seattle Genetics is trying to establish ""a redefined front-line therapy in Hodgkin lymphoma after nearly 40 years of the same therapy,"" CEO Clay Siegall told IBD in a recent interview.RELATED:Investors Siphon Biogen, Ionis Gains After Spinal Disease Drug's OKIonis Pharma Eyes Sustainable Profitability After FDA ApprovalAmgen Plans Robust 2017 In Alzheimer's, Migraines, Oncology: CEO ExclusiveBristol-Myers Won't Seek Accelerated Opdivo Lung Cancer OK
"
339,PFE,"Drugmaker Eli Lilly (LLY) will likely add a rheumatoid arthritis drug to its FDA-approved repertoire this month, says Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan, who also predicts a court decision on Lilly's chemo drug Alimta ""any day now.""The Prescription Drug Free User Act (PDUFA) date for Lilly's baricitinib is set for January. The drug belongs to a class of meds called JAK (Janus kinase) inhibitors. Eli Lilly submitted its New Drug Application, or NDA, last January for moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis.Lilly gained worldwide rights to Incyte's (INCY) baricitinib in 2009. Now, Baricitinib competes against tofacitinib, a JAK inhibitor developed by Pfizer (PFE) and the National Institutes of Health marketed as Xeljanz and Jakvinus.Incyte is also codeveloping ruxolitinib, a JAK inhibitor targeting myelofibrosis, with Novartis (NVS).IBD'S TAKE: President-elect Donald Trump caused a flurry in drug stocks late last year when he pledged to cut down on spiraling drug prices. Will he made good on that promise?Other catalysts in January include separate patent rulings in the cases of Lilly's Alimta and also for Teva Pharmaceuticals' (TEVA) copaxone, an immunosuppressant for patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.Also in January, AstraZeneca (AZN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) are likely to have some key trial data, Divan said.AstraZeneca is studying durvalumab, which has a breakthrough designation in treating patients with a specific type of urothelial bladder cancer. Bristol-Myers is looking at nivolumab to treat patients with non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).At the close on the stock market today, IBD's 43-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group, which includes Lilly, Bristol-Myers and AstraZeneca, finished the day up nearly 1%. Lilly stock, though, ticked up just 0.2% to 74.72.RELATEDLilly Spikes On 2017 Guidance; Clawing Back From Alzheimer's Drug FlopBiogen Underplays Promising Alzheimer's Data On Seizure WorriesEli Lilly Continues Alzheimer's Push After Flop; Biogen Extends Rise

340,PFE,"Shares of Seattle Genetics (SGEN) were staging a mild recovery Wednesday after plunging 15% Tuesday after the FDA halted certain trials of its drug to treat AML, acute myeloid lymphoma, but at least one analyst has cut his price target on the stock on the news.Credit Suisse analyst Kennen MacKay late Tuesday reduced his target price to 60 from 70, saying the FDA's decision to hold or partially halt phase-one trials on SGN-CD33A because some patients developed cases of hepatic venoocclusive disease, or HVOD, ""comes as a surprise to us.""In his research report, MacKay said that no such concerns had earlier been observed. He also said that Seattle Genetics' drug had been designed to address problems of HVOD associated with a predecessor drug, Mylotarg, which Pfizer (PFE) had withdrawn from the market in 2010.IBD'S TAKE: Seattle Genetics traded nearly four times as many shares as usual on Tuesday. Where is the heavy selling and buying by institutional investors at any given time? Check out IBD's Stocks on the Move, both up and down, to answer that question.Seattle Genetics stock rose as much as 3.6% in the stock market today, closing the session up 1.4% at 53.08. Shares had been up 38% for the year before Tuesday's plunge.MacKay, who maintained a neutral rating on Seattle Genetics stock, lowered his probabilities of success for SGN-CD33A on front-line older, unfit AML patients to 30% from 70%, and on younger, fit AML patients to 15% from 30%.Needham analyst Chad Messer on Tuesday, however, maintained his buy rating and 72 price target on Seattle Genetics stock. He pointed out that other AML trials continue and that the company's bigger and more likely to be successful products are treatments for Hodgkin lymphoma, which are expected to make big strides in 2017.In an as-yet unpublished Q&A with IBD completed last week, Seattle Genetics CEO Clay Siegall said the company in 2017 planned to start a phase-two AML trial on patients under age 60, but it's unclear if Tuesday's news might change those plans. The company is closed for the holidays and representatives didn't return phone calls or emails seeking comment.RELATED:Seattle Genetics Leukemia Drug Trials Halted By FDACould Trump Make Drug Development Great Again

341,PFE,"Drugmaker Medivation (MDVN) said late Tuesday that it has entered into confidentiality agreements with several potential buyers, including Sanofi (SNY), after the latter raised its bid for the company.Medivation had previously rejected Sanofi's bid of $52.50 a share in cash as inadequate, leading Sanofi in late May to propose eight candidates to take over Medivation's board. On Tuesday, Medivation said that the board had also rejected an offer of $58 a share plus a Contingent Value Right (CVR) on sales of Medivation's drug candidate talazoparib for up to $3 a share.Nonetheless, Medivation went ahead and entered a confidentiality agreement with Sanofi, along with an unspecified number of other unnamed parties.""The confidentiality agreements include customary six-month standstill provisions, subject to limited early termination events, and Medivation expects to provide each party the opportunity in the near term to review non-public information and meet with Medivation's management,"" said Medivation's press release.In early May, anonymously sourced reports said that Medivation had entered into confidentiality agreements with Pfizer (PFE) and Amgen (AMGN). Celgene (CELG), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and AstraZeneca (AZN) also have been leaked as prospective buyers.Tuesday's announcement was leaked to Reuters about a half an hour before the market closed, sending Medivation stock up 2.7% to 61.76. Shares were up a fraction after hours. The stock has been forming a flat base since it hit an 11-month high on May 9, the day the Pfizer/Amgen news came out. It holds the No. 50 spot on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks over the past 12 months.On Friday, Medivation scheduled a conference call for Wednesday after the market close, which it said will focus on talazoparib. The drug, in late-stage development for breast cancer, belongs to a class of drugs called Parp inhibitors, which got a boost last week when biotech Tesaro (TSRO) announced a surprise success for its Parp inhibitor for ovarian cancer.

343,PFE,"Big pharma Eli Lilly (LLY) jumped Wednesday as Wall Street analysts weighed the results of a narrow Food and Drug Administration advisory panel vote late Tuesday.The panel met to decide whether it's a good idea to expand the label of Lilly's diabetes drug Jardiance to include reduced death from cardiovascular causes, based on a large clinical trial called Empa-Reg. The committee voted 12 to 11 in favor of the change. Such a close vote leaves it less than clear just what decision the FDA will ultimately make.""The most cited reason for a 'No' vote was that the bar for a new claim to be granted based on a SINGLE study is very high, and panelists would like to see a second trial to 'confirm' the CV death finding,"" Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez wrote in a research note. ""Many panelists who voted 'Yes' also shared that concern, but they found the CV death benefit compelling and convincing enough to tip the balance for them.""Fernandez nonetheless liked the odds of approval, noting that ""most of the senior members of the panel, including two biostatisticians, and ALL five cardiologists, voted in favor of the new indication.""Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan is also betting in favor of a change, adding that this could read across to similar products in the SGLT-2 inhibitor class.""Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Invokana remains the market leader in the SGLT-2 space, with its CANVAS outcome study scheduled to be completed in February 2017,"" Divan wrote in a research note. ""Assuming the FDA agrees with including the EMPA-REG OUTCOME CV death data into the Jardiance label, we could see some share shift from Invokana to Jardiance until CANVAS is completed, with longer-term implications dependent on the CANVAS results.""Results from outcome studies for AstraZeneca's (AZN) Forxiga and Merck (MRK)/Pfizer's (PFE) ertugliflozin are expected later in the decade,"" Divan said.Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum was more cautious.""Despite the slight overall majority of votes in favor of the new CV indication, we view approval for an actual CV death indication as having coin-flip odds, given the unprecedented nature/results of the trial,"" Schoenebaum wrote in an email to clients. ""That said, we also feel that there's a better chance the FDA would allow this data to be added to the label instead (no indication statement).""Lilly stock rose 4% to 78.13 on the stock market today, near 77, once again above its 50-day moving average. Lilly closed just below its 200-day line, where it's been for the past five months.Johnson & Johnson stock closed up 0.9% at 119.33, a fresh record high.

344,PFE,"It's been called a ""silent epidemic"" that's slowly wasting away the livers of millions of Americans while doctors have a paltry understanding of the disease and no approved treatments.But now, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, is in the sights of more than a dozen drugmakers. Allergan (AGN) became the latest Tuesday, announcing two deals to acquire NASH treatments in less than 12 hours. It's racing companies from startup Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) to giants including Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Pfizer (PFE) to reach an untapped market that could be worth $5 billion to $10 billion a year, according to a May estimate by RBC Capital Markets Corp. analyst Michael Yee.Drugmakers still are trying to determine how different components of the disease -- inflammation, scarring and metabolic changes -- interact and are experimenting with a variety of treatment mechanisms. With so many companies piling into the field, they'll have to work to distinguish themselves.""We're looking for something that's got a 'wow' factor,"" said Alex DePaoli, chief medical officer of closely held NGM Biopharmaceuticals Inc., which has a NASH partnership with Merck & Co (MRK). ""We want to develop something that pops your eyes out.""NASH occurs when fat accumulates in the liver along with inflammation and damage, and as much as a quarter of the U.S. population may have a precursor condition, called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The ailment develops slowly, and patients often don't show symptoms until their livers are heavily damaged. It's most common in people who are overweight or have diabetes, and doctors mainly prescribe diet changes and weight loss.IBD'S TAKE: The Medical-Biomed/Biotech sector is running hot, ranked eighth among IBD's 197 industry groups. The sector is led by Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN), and more can be found about it here.While doctors need to perform a biopsy to diagnose NASH, about 6 million to 15 million people in the U.S. alone are estimated to have the condition, and about 20% of them will go on to develop life-threatening cirrhosis. NASH will be the leading cause of liver transplants by 2020, according to Allergan. Drugs that treat it likely will command high prices, Elizabeth Krutoholow, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said.At the head of the race are Intercept and French biotech firm Genfit, with large trials underway. Tobira Therapeutics (TBRA), which Allergan agreed to buy Tuesday for as much as $1.7 billion, is preparing to recruit patients for a final-stage study. Investors also are watching for results from two of Gilead's mid-stage trials that are expected to be presented this year. On the acquisition news, Tobira shares soared by more than 721% Tuesday. Shares were up another 0.5% in afternoon trades Wednesday.Intercept is testing Ocaliva, already approved to treat a rare liver disease called primary biliary cirrhosis, against NASH. Enrollment of a final-stage trial of 2,000 people is expected to be completed next year, with interim results due in 2019.A potential concern is that in an earlier trial some patients experienced itching when taking the drug, in some cases so severe that it interfered with basic activities. Chief Executive Mark Pruzanski said in an interview that he hopes Ocaliva will become a backbone treatment, used in combination with other drugs.Genfit is developing elafibranor, a once-a-day-treatment that raises fat metabolism and fights inflammation, to ""treat the underlying cause of fibrosis,"" Dean Hum, Genfit's chief scientific officer, said in an interview.While elafibranor failed to meet a primary goal in a mid-stage trial last year, it showed promise in a subset of patients with moderate and severe forms of the disease. A final-stage trial in 2,000 moderate and severe patients is underway, and the company may have data by late 2018.Beyond the startup biotechs, some of the biggest companies are paying attention and ready to do deals. Merck said it will pay as much as $450 million for its partnership with NGM. Gilead, maker of the blockbuster hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni,  bought a NASH drug from Nimbus Therapeutics LLC for $1.2 billion, including milestone payments. Before that, Gilead also bought a drug from Phenex Pharmaceuticals AG for as much as $470 million.Gilead now has four NASH candidates in its portfolio and will have data from two later this year. The drugs target different aspects of the disease and will be developed individually, but may be used in potent cocktails. Allergan's Tobira is the biggest NASH deal so far, and on Tuesday the company also announced a $50 million purchase of Akarna Therapeutics Ltd., another developer of NASH treatments.Pfizer, the biggest U.S. drugmaker, may be a future acquirer. It has a NASH drug in trials and two more to be tested in humans by the end of the year. NASH is ""a major priority,"" said Morris Birnbaum, chief scientific officer of cardiovascular and metabolic disease. The company is trying to treat the disease in its early stages.It won't be easy. Along with Genfit, Tobira's mid-stage trial failed, and Raptor Pharmaceutical (RPTP) ended its program.""Data is starting to come out of studies, and a lot of confidence will be built and lost,"" said Jay Luly, chief executive of Enanta Pharmaceuticals (ENTA), which will begin testing an experimental treatment in patients this year. ""The same, I expect, will happen with money.""

The S&P 500 closed just below its 50-day moving average after trading above that key level for most of Friday. Oil prices surged on OPEC's deal to cut output, giving a big boost to shale producers and other energy stocks. Biotech, fiber optic and several retail groups fell. The S&P 500 fell 0.1% in September but rose 3.3% for the third quarter. The Nasdaq advanced 1.9% in September and 9.7% for Q3.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said it would cap output at 32.5 million-33 million barrels per day, essentially giving up a two-year effort to drive out U.S. shale production.

348,PFE,"Medical behemoths Amgen (AMGN) and Biogen (BIIB) could square off to acquire muscle biologist Cytokinetics (CYTK), while more than a dozen potential players prep for an M&A donnybrook over small-cap Adamas Pharmaceuticals (ADMS), Needham analysts suggested Friday.Biotech M&A fodder heated up this week as Allergan (AGN) announced back-to-back deals to acquire Vitae Pharmaceuticals (VTAE) for $639 million and Tobira Therapeutics (TBRA) for $1.7 billion. The Tobira deal gives Allergan a leg up in the battle against nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), where Gilead (GILD) and Intercept (ICPT) Pharmaceuticals also compete.IBD's 420-company biotech industry group has climbed to No. 10 out of 197 groups tracked from No. 173 just 13 weeks ago. Collectively, the group has a $771 billion market cap, No. 11 among all groups. The group fell 0.7% Friday, its first decline in the past eight trading days. The group was up 3.8% for the week.Needham analysts reviewed R&D pipelines, business development areas of interest and M&A activity for 26 large companies to gauge how interested Big Pharma is in biotechs -- ""an important theme in the biotech space,"" they wrote in a research report.Since 2012, Allergan, Amgen, Bristol Myers-Squibb (BMY), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Merck (MRK), Pfizer (PFE), Roche (RHHBY), Shire (SHPG) and Valeant (VRX) have been most acquisitive, buying (or prepping to buy) more than 100 companies, collectively. Shire has been most active, with 14 acquisitions.""We believe late-development-stage and commercial-stage biotech companies are particularly attractive acquisition targets,"" they wrote in a research report titled, ""What does Big Pharma want to buy?"" Peak areas of interest include oncology and cardiovascular, Needham research showed.But that may not be where Big Pharma takes its beaucoup bucks for M&A. Needham analysts suggested central nervous system (CNS) players Adamas and Acadia Pharmaceuticals, and liver disorder drugmaker Intercept could be of prime acquisition interest.Eight firms overlap in potential interest for Adamas and Acadia: AbbVie (ABBV), Allergan, Eli Lilly (LLY), Lundbeck, Merck, Novartis Pharmaceuticals (NVS), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) and Takeda Pharmaceutical.Needham lists 13 potential acquirers for Adamas, but Allergan makes particular sense considering the duo already partner on the next-generation formulation of memantine and the fixed-dose combination product Namzaric, both of which battle Alzheimer's.By year's end, Adamas plans to file a new drug application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for ADS-5102, a treatment for levodopa-induced dyskinesia -- involuntary movements -- in Parkinson's disease patients and multiple sclerosis walking impairments, Needham wrote.Meanwhile, Acadia's 11 potential suitors could be interested in Nuplazid, a drug to ease psychosis associated with Parkinson's launched earlier this year. Needham suggests Acadia could be looking to expand the label for other uses.Similarly, Intercept could draw interest from nearly a dozen potential buyers including Gilead, No. 2 biotech by market cap. On Thursday, an RBC analyst posited Intercept would continue to lead Gilead and Allergan in the battle against NASH.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks notched higher this week, up about 4% since last week.

349,PFE,"Novartis' (NVS) newly approved breast-cancer drug is at a disadvantage to Pfizer's (PFE) Ibrance with a label warning of liver toxicity and requiring occasional heart-rhythm monitoring, an analyst said Tuesday.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez expects Pfizer to keep 67% of the market with Novartis grabbing 20%. Novartis said late Monday that the FDA had approved its drug, Kisqali, to treat some forms of post-menopausal advanced breast cancer.Kisqali's label warns of potential liver toxicity and fast or chaotic heartbeats known as QT prolongation. That means a patient must undergo electrocardiograms, electrolyte monitoring and liver function tests at various points in treatment.Like Ibrance, Kisqali is being combined with letrozole, an FDA-approved treatment for hormonally responsive breast cancer after surgery. Kisqali is as efficient as Ibrance in that combination, but the monitoring requirements could be ""burdensome,"" Fernandez said.Kisqali can be used with any aromatose inhibitor, not just letrozole.Both belong to a category of drugs that inhibit specific proteins — known as cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 — to prevent the over-proliferation of cancer cells. Ibrance was first approved as a monotherapy in February 2015. Its gained a second approval with letrozole last year.IBD'S TAKE: Pfizer also plays in the hemophilia market where it rivals the likes of Novo Nordisk, Bayer and Bioverativ. Bioverativ stock is doing well since filing its initial public offering earlier this year. Head to The New America to see why Bioverativ isn't your standard biotech startup.""Based on this and Pfizer's first-mover advantage, we continue to see Ibrance maintaining long-term market dominance in the CDK4/6 class,"" Fernandez wrote in a note. ""However, Novartis has priced Kisqali at an 18%-20% discount to Ibrance after accounting for dose, which could help drive formulatory access.""Fernandez has market perform ratings on Pfizer stock and Novartis stock.On the stock market today, Pfizer stock climbed 0.3% to 34.22. Shares of Novartis fell 0.7% to 75.06.RELATED:Will Pfizer Take On Celgene, Other Rivals With Leukemia Drug?This Pharma Firm Is Beating The Pack In Getting Drugs To Market

356,PFE,"Outspoken former pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli said the national outrage over drug pricing was blown out of proportion and heightened by the U.S. presidential election, although he conceded he could have predicted the blowback better.""In terms of regret, maybe not seeing that as acutely would've been a minor regret,"" Shkreli said during an interview on Bloomberg TV Friday. ""But because the price increase has stuck, so to speak, I don't really, that's the main mission — which was to raise the price and have it generate increased revenue — that's happened, so I'm happy with respect to that.""Privately held Turing Pharmaceuticals AG is among the companies under fire for price increases on older drugs that lack competition. Along with Mylan (MYL), the maker of emergency allergy shot EpiPen, and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX), these companies have been questioned by Congress and subjected to criticism by the public.Turing and Shkreli were among those included in a U.S. Senate committee report released this week that called for the government to stop a ""monopoly business model"" employed by some drugmakers to raise prices on some drugs.A former hedge fund manager who posts on Twitter frequently, Shkreli became the face of drug outrage after Turing raised the price of Daraprim — which fights a sometimes-deadly parasitic infection — by more than 50-fold. He left Turing after being charged by federal authorities on an unrelated matter.Asked if he would take the same business strategy again, the 33-year-old said, ""Of course."" He conceded that he put the drug company he ran at risk with his brash approach. But he also called Daraprim ""one insignificant drug"" compared with other, larger products. Shkreli said he was frustrated and that 'the government in many ways is an apparatus of vengeance.""He said the pricing situation was ""blown out of proportion,"" and he mentioned Valeant and Pfizer (PFE), the world's second-largest-drugmaker, as other companies who have raised prices recently. Turing did not respond to requests for comment.He also said he's made many fans in the business world. ""Everybody's doing it. In capitalism you try to get the highest price you can for a product,"" he said.He was at turns thoughtful and sarcastic during the interview, asking Bloomberg anchors David Westin and Jonathan Ferro, ""I don't know if you're familiar with health care insurance,"" and saying patients don't feel the brunt of price increases. While drugs make up about 10% of overall health care spending in the U.S., insurers often implement cost-sharing with patients and increase the premiums patients pay in response to long-term rising costs.Federal prosecutors have accused Shkreli of defrauding investors in the hedge funds, and of using $11 million of Retrophin assets to pay them off. He also allegedly hid his control in the company's unrestricted stock to help pay off his debts. He was arrested in December 2015 and has pleaded not guilty.He said he's looking forward to the upcoming trial, scheduled for June.""We're going to win by a landslide,"" he said. ""The evidence is clear that I did nothing wrong.""Shkreli is known for his blunt opinions in an industry that often tries to present a unified front. During a congressional hearing on drug prices in February, he invoked his Fifth Amendment rights as a way of refusing to answer questions, then after the hearing called lawmakers ""imbeciles"" on Twitter.During his trial, Shkreli predicted that jurors will see somebody they can relate to, not the figure he claims he's been portrayed as in interviews.""Invariably, when people read the headline about Martin Shkreli, they hate Martin Shkreli. When they get to know Martin Shkreli, they love Martin Shkreli,"" he said.During the TV interview, Shkreli brought up the $1 billion federal fraud case against the co-founder and several associates of hedge fund Platinum Partners. The U.S. has accused Platinum of a Ponzi-like scheme. Platinum co-founder Mark Nordlicht pleaded not guilty this week.Shkreli said he had 'tangoed"" with the hedge fund over a trade, before investigators brought the case, and called the investigations and charges an example of what the government should go after. After his interview on Bloomberg, he declined to comment on whether he had spoken to federal investigators about the Platinum case.

357,PFE,"A new year renews hopes of stock market success for ETF investors and reminds them to beware of old, painful traps. As you draw up your investing action plan for 2017, some tips from pros may be helpful.But first, here is a look at the past year in exchange traded funds, because no look forward is complete without a look back.In a word, 2016 was a scorcher. Even the simplest, broadest and cheapest exposure to the stock market through ETFs paid off.Vanguard Total Stock Market (VTI), SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) and iShares MSCI All Country World Index (ACWI) advanced 12.8%, 12.0% and 8.4% last year, respectively.Best And Worst ETFs Of 2016The gains for SPY outpaced the approximately 10% average annualized return for the S&P 500 since 1926 — and were impressive given the sharp, repeated bouts of volatility in the stock markets.Even more impressive was the performance of specialized ETF strategies that investors seized to profit in 2016.PureFunds ISE Junior Silver (SILJ) ended the year with a 138.5% gain, despite a knock back in the final quarter. It is the best performer of 2016 among 1,763 nonleveraged ETFs.VanEck Russia Small-Cap (RSXJ) flew 103.7% higher, VanEck Vectors Fallen Angel High Yield Bond (ANGL) 25.7% and PowerShares DB Base Metals (DBB) 25.6%.With several ETFs outperforming across every major asset class — U.S. and foreign stocks, bonds and commodities — the industry itself kept up its hot growth streak.Total assets in U.S. exchange traded products stood at $2.455 trillion in November, up 16% from 2015 and more than double the level from five years ago, according to Morningstar data.Importantly, that asset growth was driven by net new inflow. Investors poured $224 billion in fresh money into U.S.-listed ETFs in 2016 through November.That, says Ben Johnson, Morningstar's director of global ETF research, is on track to be a record by the time 2016 closes out.Investors prize broadly diversified exposure to core and satellite segments of the financial markets. Investing in ETFs is a low-cost and tax-efficient way to get that exposure.As you prime your portfolio for the new year, bear in mind that the market and investment outlook is a lot different from years past.That's tied in large part to a change in the political regime. A Donald Trump presidency, coupled with a Republican-controlled congress, should translate to a more favorable business environment.Some industries and sectors are expected to benefit more than others from the likelihood of corporate tax cuts, less stringent regulations and more government spending. Think banks and insurers, oil and gas firms, and makers of heavy machinery and building products.It's not too late to ride the great rotation into the financial, materials and industrial sectors since the Nov. 8 election.Investors should keep the best opportunities within these broad sectors in mind as they make their financial plans, Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research at CFRA, said on a recent webcast.In 2016 as a whole, and following the Nov. 8 election, ETFs with a smaller cap skew — such as Fidelity MSCI Industrials (FIDU) and SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense (XAR) — have edged out rivals with a larger cap skew — such as Industrial Select Sector SPDR (XLI) and PowerShares Aerospace & Defense (PPA).That trend could continue in a climate of stronger GDP numbers and rising interest rates.""Smaller-cap stocks generally are more sensitive to the U.S. economy,"" Rosenbluth told IBD. ""Since the election, optimism has improved for future growth.""For much of the past seven years, growth outpaced value. But in 2016, investors turned to inexpensive names.""This shift signals a clear risk-on tone by the market,"" strategists at State Street Global Advisors wrote recently. ""And that could continue if the Trump administration continues to strike a more pro-cyclical, pro-business tone.""The investment management firm tied the value comeback to investors' leeriness of scarce earnings growth and relatively high stock valuations.Some ETFs make their focus on value stocks self-evident — iShares Russell 1000 Value (IWD), iShares Edge MSCI USA Value Factor (VLUE) or Vanguard Value (VTV), for example.Their top holdings include household names such as Apple (AAPL), Exxon Mobil (XOM), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Pfizer (PFE) and AT&T (T).In other cases, such as iShares Edge MSCI Multifactor USA (LRGF) or SPDR MSCI USA StrategicFactors (QUS), the value bet is less obvious.Most dividend ETFs offer a value tilt, too, but not all may fare equally well in the reflationary environment ahead.High-dividend stocks will likely struggle amid rising rates, according to BlackRock strategists.On the other hand, quality companies that consistently grow their dividends should hold up better when yields rise, they added.These companies can be found in an ETF wrapper within iShares Core Dividend Growth (DGRO), ProShares Russell 2000 Dividend Growers (SMDV) and ProShares S&P MidCap 400 Dividend Aristocrats (REGL).SMDV and REGL jumped more than 30% apiece in 2016 to become the top diversified ETFs of 2016 in their respective categories.A total of 249 exchange traded products debuted in 2016 — the fourth highest total since 1993, according to Morningstar — proving to some that you can have too much of a good thing.Johnson, Morningstar's ETF guru, is a vocal critic of what he describes as the ""spaghetti cannon"" of very niche and increasingly complex ETFs being launched in the market.He notes with some satisfaction that 2016 was also a record year for ETF closures — approximately 114 by his count.""I would expect that as time goes on, that number will only continue to grow as a lot of the spaghetti that providers have been slinging against the wall in recent years ultimately fails to stick,"" he was quoted as saying recently.Happily, smart ETF investors ""aren't taking the bait"" of gimmicky new products, he added.As evidence, Johnson points to the fact that most of the new money is going into the lowest cost, most broadly diversified ETFs that serve as core portfolio building blocks.RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewSmall-Cap Value ETFs Show Again Why They Are Darlings Of The Market

358,PFE,"Clovis Oncology (CLVS) popped 15% to 28.01 Thursday to an eight-month high, after the biotech said that its drug candidate will be spared an FDA panel discussion.Clovis' stock gained 27% on Aug. 23 when the FDA granted priority review to its application for approval of rucaparib for ovarian cancer, with Feb. 23 as its decision deadline. But the process could have slowed down if the agency had decided to convene a panel of outside experts. The FDA often convenes such panels when it seeks feedback on drugs that have issues.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech group has jumped to No. 17 from No. 126 8 weeks ago and No. 152 a quarter ago, which means it's a good time to be tracking the group. With high drug prices one the major ongoing issues for the sector, when hunting for biotech stocks investors might want to check out earnings for volume gains vs. revenue gains.Clovis is in something of a race to be first to market with rucaparib's class of drug, called PARP inhibitors.Tesaro (TSRO) scored a surprise win in a late-stage clinical trial of its own PARP inhibitor for ovarian cancer back in June, and Medivation (MDVN), which is in the process of being acquired by Pfizer (PFE), has a PARP inhibitor in advanced development for breast cancer.But the class does have a checkered history in other clinical trials, raising the possibility of extra FDA scrutiny. Clovis said in a brief SEC filing Thursday that the FDA had decided to skip the expert panel, however.Tesaro investors also seemed relieved by the news. Tesaro stock was up 7.5% to 94.77 on the stock market today.RELATED:3 Biotech Stocks That Could Make Big Moves In September

359,PFE,"Recent Wall Street darling Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) isn't the only potential takeover candidate among hot, or potentially hot, biotech companies, says RBC Capital Markets.In a research report Wednesday, RBC analysts list Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIA), Spark Therapeutics (ONCE), BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN), Aerie Pharmaceuticals (AERI), Intra-Cellular Therapies (ITCI), Tesaro (TSRO), Incyte (INCY) and Puma Biotechnology (PBYI) -- as well as Sarepta — as top takeover contenders, all on their late-stage or FDA-approved ""blockbuster franchises.""Sarepta stock rocketed 74% on Monday after the FDA approved its drug to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the first drug approved to treat the rare disease. Sarepta stock hit another all-time high Wednesday, above 58 for the first time since March 2002. Sarepta closed up 0.9% to 56.22 in the stock market today.After the close, Sarepta announced plans to offer up to $225 million in stock to finance further trials, production and other drug efforts. But shares were little changed late.IBD's 214-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group rose 0.5% Wednesday, its sixth straight gain and touching an eight-month high intraday. The group ranks No. 8 of 197 groups tracked, up from No. 175 just 13 weeks ago.The second half of 2016 is likely to prove a rallying point for biotech stocks, RBC analysts said.""Biotech sentiment should continue to improve and investors should 'climb the wall of worry' as we get through the year and past the election, which we believe has been mostly based on political rhetoric,"" the analysts wrote.IBD'S TAKE: Many biotechs, and a fair number of stocks overall, have recently hit 52-week highs, and you can check out these stocks — listed by Composite Rating — at IBD's New Highs listing. This is a good feature to check for winning stocks.M&A furor has been heating up in the biotech sector. Over the past 10 months, four biotech acquisitions valued at over $5 billion have been announced, RBC said, along with a smattering of smaller deals. On Tuesday, Allergan (AGN) announced an agreement to acquire liver-disease drugmaker Tobira Therapeutics (TBRA) for as much as $1.7 billion.Among the big deals pending, Pfizer (PFE) is buying Medivation (MDVN) for $14 billion and in June bought Anacor Pharmaceuticals for $5.2 billion. Also, AbbVie (ABBV) is acquiring privately held Stemcentyrx for $10.2 billion. Shire (SHPG) and Baxalta completed their $32 billion merger in June.RELATED:Sarepta Soars As FDA Approves Its Drug To Treat Muscular DystrophyBiotech Stocks Hot As Sarepta Provides Shot In The Arm

360,PFE,"Swiss pharma giant Novartis (NVS) said Wednesday that it's shuttering its Cell & Gene Therapy unit, though it said it remains committed to its cancer-fighting CAR-T cell program.The market took this as a negative vote for the program, however, knocking down CAR-T-focused stocks Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), Bluebird Bio (BLUE) and Kite Pharma (KITE).The website Endpoint News first reported the Cell & Gene Therapy Unit's disbanding, saying that its activities will be integrated into the larger Novartis organization, but about 120 of the 400 positions there will be eliminated, including unit head Usman Azam. Novartis still plans to file for approval of its lead CAR-T candidate, CTL019, for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) next year.Kite and Juno are also working on therapies targeting the CD-19 antigen. On the stock market today, Novartis fell 0.7% to 78.77, while Juno was down 6.2% near 29.58 and Kite was off 1.9% to 57.62. Bluebird, which has an earlier-stage CAR-T program, was down 3% to 49.34.IBD'S TAKE: CAR-T therapy has yet to make it to market, making investing in it a very risky business. To find out how IBD chooses winning stocks, see the CAN SLIM Investing System.""In our view, some investors may view this as a negative datapoint for CAR-T and a suggestion that Novartis is cutting back investment and resources to CAR-T,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee in a research note. ""But we think (1) reorganizing and restructuring divisions sounds pretty typical and regular for Big Pharma's broader bureaucracy vs biotech ... (2) Novartis is essentially a third player in the four-man CD-19 race with Kite in the lead in the big market (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL) and Juno and Novartis both targeting ALL as the lead indication, and Cellectis (CLLS)/Pfizer (PFE) starting Phase I for allogeneic CD-19 off-the-shelf work.""It didn't help matters that late Tuesday, BTIG initiated coverage of Kite Pharma with a neutral rating, noting that the data on CAR-T therapies is still very limited, though some of it has shown spectacular results. Kite's KTE-019 could be the first to market next year, wrote analyst Dane Leone, but it's not yet known how its data will ultimately compare with Novartis' and Juno's.

361,PFE,"Embattled drug giant Mylan (MYL) said Monday that it will take the unusual step of launching a generic competitor to its own product, EpiPen, at half the price of the original.Mylan spent last week defending itself against criticism from the Senate and from presidential candidate Hillary Clinton over its multiple price hikes for EpiPen, an emergency allergy treatment. On Thursday, Mylan said it would expand patient assistance for EpiPen without actually lowering the price. But on Monday, it said that in the next few weeks it will release a generic version at $300 for a two-pack, compared with the current $608 price for the brand.""Our decision to launch a generic alternative to EpiPen is an extraordinary commercial response, which required the cooperation of our partner,"" said Mylan CEO Heather Bresch in a statement, presumably referring to Pfizer (PFE), which draws royalties on the product. ""However, because of the complexity and opaqueness of today's branded pharmaceutical supply chain and the increased shifting of costs to patients as a result of high-deductible health plans, we determined that bypassing the brand system in this case and offering an additional alternative was the best option.""IBD'S TAKE: Mylan's misadventures show why relying on price increases for growth is a risky strategy. To find out how much other drugmakers are doing the same, check out our recent rundown of price vs. volume growth among big biotechs.Later on Monday, however, U.S. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, and ranking committee member Elijah Cummings, D-Md., sent a letter to Bresch asking for documentation relating to Mylan's income and profit from EpiPen, as well as its patient-assistance programs, government funding, arrangements with Pfizer and lobbying activities.Three Republican members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce also sent a letter to the FDA asking about the process for approving EpiPen's generic competitors, which has come under fire from some quarters because it's taking so long.Mylan also intends to bypass some of the system's complexities by launching a direct-ship program for EpiPen customers, potentially getting around some of the middlemen that Bresch said last week took cuts of most of EpiPen's list price.Normally when generic competition threatens, the drug developer makes a deal with a generic drugmaker to sell the exclusive ""authorized generic"" for the first six months before other competitors can come onto the market. However, since Mylan's main business is generic drugs, it can essentially be the generic partner to itself.EpiPen has been off patent for a while, and generic versions of the drug it contains, epinephrene, are already available. It's the injection device, which delivers a precise dose of the drug, that's proven tricky to replicate. Sanofi (SNY) had a competitor out called Auvi-Q that was recalled last October when some of the devices malfunctioned. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) has a device that failed its first attempt at FDA approval, though the company expects to re-file in the coming months.""We estimate Mylan's launch of an EpiPen authorized generic (AG) will have a 8-14% impact on our 2016-17 EpiPen sales estimates and a modest impact (2%) on our EPS forecasts,"" Leerink analyst Jason Gerberry wrote in a research note. ""Our estimated AG impact does not account for any reduction in SG&A (sales, general & administrative spending) commitments with EpiPen, which Mylan may look to initiate in order to mitigate the EPS downside.""Mylan initially rallied as much as 2.8% on the generic EpiPen news, but closed up 0.4% to 43.22 on the stock market today. Teva stock was down 1.55% to 50.75.
"
362,PFE,"Injectable-drug specialist Eagle Pharmaceuticals (EGRX) stock was down sharply Monday after it got a downgrade from Mizuho saying that its thesis had played out.Eagle stock jumped 28% on June 10 when Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) won a patent case against several generic drugmakers, including Pfizer's (PFE) Hospira unit and Sagent Pharmaceuticals (SGNT), that were trying to launch generic versions of its blood-cancer drug Treanda. In January, Teva and Eagle launched a low-volume, faster-acting version of Treanda called Bendeka, which it says it expects to replace Treanda on the market eventually.Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler wrote in her research note that she expects the companies to retain market exclusivity for Bendeka until 2019, but she said other catalysts might be slow in coming.""The Treanda/Bendeka switch is a genuine success story for Eagle, but its other hospital launches like Ryanodex and Docetaxel have been more challenging,"" Koffler wrote as she downgraded the stock to neutral from buy. ""We are reminded that cost is still critical within this setting, and this insight has influenced our longer-term outlook on Bendeka and the rest of Eagle's portfolio.""Koffler noted that Eagle is preparing to file for approval of a version of Eli Lilly's (LLY) lung-cancer drug Alimta, which is altered in a way similar to Bendeka's reformulation of Treanda, but she doubted that it will be as lucrative as the Teva deal.""We are concerned about competition from other 505(b)(2) filers like Allergan (AGN), who has already launched this type of product in EU,"" she wrote. ""For this reason, we think that replicating a Bendeka-like agreement could be challenging here.""Eagle turned its first annual profit last year, of 16 cents a share, which analysts expect to jump to $4.56 this year with the help of the Bendeka launch. The stock nonetheless has a single-digit Relative Strength Rating, and ended trading down 9% on the stock market today, to 40.76.

363,PFE,"Back in 2014, when specialty-drug maker Allergan was fending off a hostile takeover bid from Valeant Pharmaceuticals, one of its main reasons for resistance was its claim that Valeant would decimate its research and development capabilities.Indeed, at that time, Valeant boasted that it had figured out a way to spend far less on R&D than other large drugmakers, while still cranking out new drugs.Two years later, the scene looks very different. Valeant (VRX), plagued by scandal and financial troubles, is reworking its business model. And Ireland-based Allergan (AGN) is touting an approach to R&D it calls ""open science,"" following its merger with Actavis -- and after its near-merger with Pfizer (PFE) that would have been the industry's largest but was scuttled in April when the U.S. changed its tax rules concerning companies looking to locate their headquarters in lower-tax countries. Like Valeant, Botox maker Allergan doesn't have its own internal research infrastructure and spends less on R&D than your typical Big Pharma. But it still spends more than Valeant and other low-cost specialty pharmas through its collaborations with a host of small biotechs and other external developers in its quest for leading drugs.Allergan CEO Brenton Saunders and R&D chief David Nicholson recently spoke with IBD to explain more about what open science means and how it could help Allergan grow.IBD: A lot of companies acquire or license externally developed drugs, so how is ""open science"" differentiating? Saunders: Maybe we can start by giving you our perspective on open science and why we think it's the preferred model for Allergan.We start with the premise that innovation and investment in R&D is crucial to the success of Allergan. Our mission is to help people live their lives better by finding cures and treatments to unmet medical need. And so therefore, we need to be in the innovation business. When we look at how do we participate in the most efficient, effective way, we believe that open science is the most effective construct for Allergan. We are focused in seven therapeutic areas (and) trying to be leaders in all seven, but to build scale in discovery platforms could be potentially counterproductive for us.When we look at where innovation comes from, and how innovation in health care is best accomplished, we believed it was better to tap into this very vast ecosystem of innovators. These are academic research centers. They're venture-backed startup companies. They're private companies. They're R&D-based public companies, and they're research spinouts out of large pharmaceutical companies and beyond. When we look at the totality of that universe, it's much larger than anything we could ever build on our own.It also provides some additional advantages for us. One is it provides the ability to pursue the best ideas with the best probability of success and the potential to meet the most unmet need, because we're not wedded to internal programs that we have made significant investment to, and we'd have to justify canceling or bypassing in order to chase an idea we believe was better.I think it also creates an attitude difference. We don't have a team of people here who are opposed to going outside for fresh ideas. We don't have a ""not invented here"" syndrome, because we depend on open science to sustain our innovation flow, and so we need to be good at partnering and licensing and acquiring R&D assets, and so we've developed a core capability around it.Now, in order to be a good partner, part of open science means we need to be a development powerhouse and also a commercial powerhouse. Because generally people don't want to give you their ideas unless they have extreme confidence that, one, you can finish them, that you have all the requisite skills in research development, like pharmaceutical science or clinical development or regulatory affairs to get the science to become a drug. And they generally want to take a royalty or milestone payment with regard to commercial success -- so they want to believe that, in your hands, the approved drug can become a commercial success as well.Nicholson: One of our advantages, in that we don't have an internal research organization, is that we don't need to do technology-based collaborations to feed our research. We have collaborations that are exquisitely focused on products within our therapeutic areas.The open-science model for me is collaboration with this huge resource in the external world, the biotech industry. And our open-science model is focused exquisitely on novel, innovative product opportunities within our seven therapeutic areas. And I think that makes us almost unique in the industry.IBD: So when you say you don't have to license technology, are you talking about a platform or a delivery technology or something like that?Nicholson: When I'm talking about technology platforms, I'm talking about very, very fundamental research technology and discovery technology. Clearly, we are interested in technology that can be utilized within development for novel pharmaceutical science technology. For instance, we did a deal with Anterios recently that gave us access to technology that lets us get large molecules across the dermal barrier.Because we don't do discovery research, we don't have to have pure technology-based discovery collaborations. When we have collaborations in the early space, it's because that technology is already delivering development projects.Saunders: If you have deep discovery in platforms and technologies, it can take away some of your flexibility to purse novel or interesting new technologies, because you've made such an investment in that capability. It's almost a fixed investment, if you will.IBD: Since many companies are looking for drugs to acquire or license, how competitive is the scene out there?Saunders: There's some areas where it remains incredibly competitive. A good example is oncology, where there really is an arms race occurring in large pharma to acquire as much technology as possible, particularly as the technology is exploding. You can see that in some of the dealmaking and the price of some of the dealmaking lately in the cancer arena.In the seven therapeutic areas we compete in, there is some competition, but we generally are the 800-pound gorilla in those areas. We pride ourselves in our reputation of being easy to do business with, and being committed to strong and productive partnership skills. That's something that we believe is a competitive advantage, and something we take quite seriously.IBD: The appropriate spending level of R&D is much-debated of late. How do you decide the appropriate level?Saunders: My view on spending R&D dollars is very practical. We will invest in R&D where we believe the investment targets an unmet medical need -- i.e., it's innovative -- that the probability of success meets certain criteria, (and) that we have the capabilities to make it successful.So we, very differently than most of the rest of the industry, don't target our spend based on revenue numbers. We spend against programs that we think make a difference.Nicholson: This is part of our open-science model. Because we don't have the fixed costs that are normally associated with running a discovery organization, we make certain that we have a development powerhouse with a certain proportion of flexible spend. Therefore, we can flex up and down the amount of cash we spend on R&D, depending on what the pipeline needs.IBD: What's your preference as to the stage of development at which you enter into the process with these external programs?Saunders: One of the best-kept secrets about Allergan is that we would enter an agreement or collaboration at any stage of development -- early, mid or late. We've done that quite successfully. The drug we just launched for schizophrenia and bipolar mania, Vraylar -- we entered into that collaboration 14 years ago and really developed that drug from phase one all the way to approval. It was quite complex pharmaceutical science and development.People tend to talk about the R&D that we bring in at a later stage -- because it seems more real, right? It's closer in time. But the reality is, we are very open-minded to entering into those collaborations and R&D-related structures any time in the continuum, so long as it meets the criteria of meaningful innovation, probability of success and (that it) fits within our capabilities.IBD: Of course, the probability of success is more difficult to gauge the earlier it gets. How do you gauge that?Saunders: A lot of times you can manage that through structure. For example, we have a structured deal with a company called Rhythm Health. We really were impressed with the work Rhythm Health was doing with a condition called diabetic gastroparesis. There really hasn't been any meaningful pharmaceutical advances in diabetic gastroparesis in about 30 years.David and the team at Allergan evaluated the science and the work that was being done at Rhythm, and while early, we thought it was incredibly innovative. So we signed an option agreement with Rhythm where they will finish the phase-2b study, which will read out in a few months. If positive, we have the option to bring it into Allergan in phase three and finish the development.We did the same thing with a company called Trevena (TRVN) and an acute heart-failure drug. They reported those results a few weeks ago and the study failed, and therefore we didn't exercise the option.We don't have a one-size-fits-all. We will do a deal at any stage of development depending on the preferences of the partner, and the conviction in the science on our side that makes sense. One of the things that is a hallmark of Allergan is being open and flexible to principles of mutuality. How do you create a win-win for the inventor of an idea and the people who will be responsible to bring it to conclusion? We're always looking for mutuality in all our deals to create that win-win scenario to make everyone feel good and remain constructive and productive around bringing it to fruition.

The move came after Pfizer posted Q1 sales that beat Wall Street's consensus view and raised guidance. The base passes the midpoint test, as the handle's midpoint of 32.97 exceeds that of the base itself (32.16). Volume was running more than four times its usual pace.The average daily volume of Pfizer shares is 50.04 million, or roughly 7.7 million shares each hour of the trading day.The Nasdaq composite dropped nearly 1.3%, more than the 1.1% loss by both the S&P 500 and Dow industrials, as all three indexes quickly gave back Monday's advance and more. The Dow transports slumped more than 2.2%, but the Dow utilities were up nearly 0.2%.Among the 30 Dow industrials components, banks suffered the biggest slide: JPMorgan Chase (JPM) gapped down more than 2% to 62.33, sliding beneath its 200-day moving average in more than double average trade. Goldman Sachs (GS) fell more than 2% to 162.13; the investment bank is still within the depths of a first-stage base, lying more than 25% below a 218.77 52-week high.Meanwhile, Pfizer said Q1 sales jumped 13% to $13 billion, a full $1 billion higher than expected. The maker of name-brand prescription pharmaceuticals and over-the-counter medications, including the Viagra impotency drug and Advil painkiller, noted that the first quarter benefited from five extra days, boosting the top line by $900 million. Adjusted earnings rose to 67 cents a share vs. 51 cents a year ago, crushing the 55-cent consensus view.Pfizer gets a lowly Composite Rating of 52, ranking 11th within IBD's Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group (see the ranking here at IBD Stock Checkup). The three-year annual EPS growth rate is weak at 2%, but the company is expressing bullishness about its new products that are going through late-stage clinical trials. The company is also planning to decide this year whether to spin off its generics business. Pfizer's generics sales jumped 17% to nearly $6 billion, while its patent-protected drug sales rose 23% to $7.03 billion.Elsewhere in the stock market today, growth-stock leader Weibo (WB) cooled off, falling more than 5% to 23. Volume zoomed five times normal pace. The social network, known as the ""Twitter (TWTR) of China,"" is still sharply above a recent 19.20 cup-with-handle buy point.

Shares are trading 10% below their 52-week high.Meanwhile, Mylan is expected to see earnings rise 6% to 74 cents a share on a 19% gain in revenue to $2.23 billion. Last quarter, Mylan missed expectations and the stock crumbled. The company also announced it was buying Sweden’s Meda for $9.9 billion.Mylan breached its 50-day line last week and snapped six straight sessions of declines Monday. The stock is trading 42% below its 52-week peak and climbed 2.4% Monday.The drugstore chain is expected to see earnings rise 2% to $1.16 a share when it reports Tuesday morning.

371,PFE,"Specialty-drug giant Allergan (AGN) got conflicting messages from Wall Street on Friday, as Goldman Sachs put the stock on its Conviction Buy list, while Mizuho lowered its price target, due to differing opinions about the company's near-term strategy.Goldman analyst Jami Rubin wrote in a research note that after meeting with top executives, she believes the company is on track to deliver sustainable double-digit top-line growth and margin expansion.Rubin added that near-term catalysts include the closing of Allergan's $40 billion sale of its generics business to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA), which both Teva and Allergan confirmed this week will happen next month, as well as the potential $10 billion share buyback Allergan unveiled during its Q1 earnings report on Tuesday.For Rubin, Allergan's decision to scale back its acquisition strategy in favor of the stock buyback makes sense.""We believe Allergan management is listening to shareholders and placing capital deployment priorities on unlocking value by investing in the most attractive assets available -- Allergan shares,"" Rubin wrote.Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler, however, found the shift less than inspiring.""Aside from a large $5-billion-to-$10-billion share buyback, management is not pursuing any transformational changes to the business (as expected), and (we) are less excited by an execution story,"" she wrote in a research note, lowering her price target to 232 from 250, while affirming a neutral rating.The market for now sides with Goldman. Allergan stock rose 3.4% on the stock market today, to 223.35.But Allergan shares are still down nearly 30% this year, and they plunged 15% on April 5 after the company and Pfizer (PFE) called off their $160 billion marriage as the Treasury Department issued new rules to discourage mergers that would enable U.S. companies to move their headquarters to lower-tax countries, such as Allergan's home base of Ireland.

372,PFE,"Drugmaker Actavis faces fines for raising the cost of hydrocortisone tablets by more than 12,000%, British antitrust regulators said Friday as they continued a crackdown on excessive pricing in the pharmaceutical industry.The division of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) ""broke competition law by charging excessive and unfair prices in the U.K.,"" the Competition and Markets Authority said in a statement. In one example, The company raised the price of the 10 milligram packs from roughly 88 cents to $110 in U.S. currency. Teva, which acquired Actavis for $40.5 billion from Allergan (AGN) earlier this year, said it will ""defend the allegations.""""This is a lifesaving drug relied on by thousands of patients, which the (U.K.'s National Health Service, or NHS) has no choice but to continue purchasing,"" said Andrew Groves, CMA senior responsible officer. ""We allege that the company has taken advantage of this situation and the removal of the drug from price regulation, leaving the NHS — and ultimately the taxpayer — footing the bill for the substantial price rises.""The CMA sent Actavis a statement of objections laying out its concerns amid a wider crackdown on unfair drug pricing. On Dec. 7, the CMA fined Pfizer (PFE) and Flynn Pharma a record amount for abusing their dominant position by charging unfair prices for unbranded versions of the Epanutin anti-epilepsy drug.The regulator fined Pfizer roughly $105.2 million and Flynn Pharma $6.5 million after they increased prices by as much as 2,600% in September 2012. The price increases occurred after Pfizer transferred distribution rights to Flynn, which sold the medicine by its generic name, phenytoin sodium.Teva, which is already in the process of selling Actavis's U.K. operations to Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd., said the CMA probe raises broader questions about the regulation of generic medications.Although the pricing of the Actavis product ""under investigation was never under Teva's effective control, Teva believes that intervention by the CMA in prices for generic medicines raises serious policy concerns regarding the roles of both the CMA and the Department of Health,"" Teva said. ""Generic medicines continue to be an affordable alternative to branded therapies.""A statement of objections can often lead to fines or orders to change business practices. The regulator has the power to fine companies found to have abused a dominant market position up to 10% of their annual revenue.Hydrocortisone tablets are used as the primary replacement therapy for people whose adrenal glands do not produce sufficient amounts of natural steroid hormones, resulting in conditions such as Addison's disease. The tablets are also used to treat conditions such as arthritis, blood, hormone and immune system disorders, skin and eye conditions, breathing problems, cancer, and severe allergies.Actavis also increased the price of 20 milligram hydrocortisone tablets by nearly 9,500%, resulting in charges to the NHS of $128.32 per pack by March 2016, the CMA said. The NHS had previously paid the equivalent of $1.34 per pack.Before April 2008, the NHS spent about 522,000 pounds a year on hydrocortisone tablets. By 2015, NHS spend on the tablets had risen to $87.4 million a year.Steep price hikes have put a string of drugmakers under the microscope in the U.S. with companies like Mylan (MYL) and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX). bearing the brunt of the public outrage.

379,PFE,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Apple (AAPL) led the S&P 500 with the largest amount spent on stock buybacks in the first quarter, which in total set a nine-year high as companies sought to boost their stock price in a slumping market, according to the S&P Dow Jones Indices.Gilead spent $8 billion, up from the $3.1 billion it spent in the prior quarter. Apple spent $6.7 billion, slightly down from its prior quarter's $6.9 billion.Companies in the S&P 500 spent a total of $161.4 billion in stock buybacks in Q1, up 12% from Q1 2015. It was the second-largest expenditure on record, following the $172 billion spent in Q3 2007, as reported by the S&P Dow Jones Indices.The information technology sector continued to dominate buybacks. Following Apple in the IT sector were Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL) and Alphabet (GOOGL). Microsoft spent $3.85 billion, with Oracle at $2.2 billion and Alphabet at $2 billion.Following Gilead and Apple as the biggest spenders, General Electric (GE) was No. 3 at $6.3 billion, then came Pfizer (PFE) at $5 billion and McDonalds (MCD) at $4.3 billion.

"
380,PFE,"Shares of pharma major AbbVie (ABBV) were sliding Wednesday after Morgan Stanley downgraded it on concerns of increasing competition.Analyst David Risinger downgraded AbbVie stock to equal weight and lowered his price target to 65 from 73, noting that the nature of AbbVie's pipeline has become clearer since its R&D day on June 1 and its presentations on its cancer drugs over the weekend, including its negatively received report on Rova-T. In the meantime, AbbVie still depends on its immunology drug Humira, the analyst said.""With 2015 sales of $14 billion, Humira is the world's best-selling drug and generated 61% of AbbVie's 2015 total sales (and we estimate the vast majority of profits),"" Risinger wrote. ""Humira not only faces challenges from several biosimilar players (including Amgen (AMGN), Novartis' (NVS) Sandoz, and Pfizer (PFE)), but also from novel branded injectables and orals.""If AbbVie can score a string of patent litigation victories, that may allay investors' concerns, but we are unable to make that call,"" Risinger wrote.Humira's market exclusivity already suffered one setback last month, when the patent board agreed to review a challenge to a Humira patent brought by biosimilar developer Coherus Biosciences (CHRS), though that likely will take years to resolve.Risinger wrote that newer classes of drugs treating the same conditions that Humira does, including Novartis' Cosentyx and Eli Lilly's (LLY) Taltz and baricitinib, should slow down Humira's growth in the near term.This threat gained some support Wednesday, when Novartis said that among its presentations at the European League Against Rheumatism conference, running Wednesday through Saturday, are ""new long-term analyses suggesting Cosentyx may lead to higher responses than Humira in improving the signs and symptoms of people living with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) at 52 weeks."" Novartis said it will initiate head-to-head trials to confirm this.""That said, AbbVie's own novel autoimmune disease products should help offset moderation, including JAK ABT-494 and IL-23 risankizumab,"" Risinger wrote. ""We expect both to launch in 2019.""AbbVie stock fell 2.1% at the close on the stock market today, to 61.73.

"
381,PFE,"Bristol-Myers Squibb vs. Merck, Pfizer vs. Lilly and a unique treatment from AbbVie (ABBV) will take the spotlight next week at the biggest drug conference focused on treatments for one of the biggest diseases: cancer.The annual meeting of the American Society for Clinical Oncology in Chicago on June 3-7 is a prime opportunity to check up on some potential blockbuster drugs.The abstracts for most of the presentations were released to the public on May 18, giving the gist of study results but leaving details for the conference itself. And some of the most interesting items for investors will be among the late-breaking abstracts.As in the past several ASCO meetings, the battle of the immunotherapies will be a major theme. The two marketed PD-1 inhibitors, Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Opdivo and Merck's (MRK) Keytruda, are already big sellers in skin and lung cancer, with Opdivo ahead in market share. But ongoing research will give an idea of their true market potential, as well as how they stack up against each other.As is often the case for cancer drugs, Opdivo and Keytruda were both approved for advanced cases of the disease first, but the largest market opportunity is for front-line treatment of newly diagnosed patients. Among the cancers, one of the largest market opportunities is in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which Bristol-Myers and Merck are targeting.In the first abstract release, Merck's Keynote-021 study of Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy yielded improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) of 10 months overall, and 14 to 15 months in patients whose tumors showed high expression of PD-L1, the ligand the PD-1 inhibitors indirectly target.""Here we continue to see solid ORR (overall response rate, or percentage of tumors that shrank) and PFS data, and look to the meeting to better understand the durability of the response over longer periods of time,"" wrote Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan in a May 19 research note.Bristol-Myers is also conducting first-line NSCLC studies. Its most significant might be Checkmate-012, which combines Opdivo with another Bristol-Myers immunotherapy drug, Yervoy. If that proves to be the most effective combo, then that would be huge for the company, since Bristol-Myers would wholly own the treatment and thus gain all the revenue from it.There was no new Checkmate-012 info in the early abstracts, but analysts hope it will be among the late-breaking data.Morningstar analyst Damien Conover says he also wants to see data on Tecentriq, Roche's (RHHBY) entry into a sister class of drugs that target the PD-L1 ligand directly. By coincidence, the FDA approved Tecentriq for a type of bladder cancer called urothelial carcinoma on the same day the ASCO abstracts were released.""They were first to file in bladder (cancer),"" Conover told IBD. ""Bladder's a big indication -- not as big as lung cancer, but having that niche for Roche will really help drive that drug's sale.""Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez, however, notes that Tecentriq could soon have competition, as shown in other ASCO presentations.""Initial data for Bristol Myers’ Opdivo and AstraZeneca's (AZN) durvalumab show higher response rates in this indication,"" Fernandez wrote in his May 19 research note. ""Beyond the smaller patient numbers in both data sets, baseline characteristics to be presented at ASCO should be closely watched.""A newer battle seems to be shaping up in a different drug class, called the CDK 4/6 inhibitors, used to treat breast cancer. The CDK stands for cyclin-dependent kinase, an enzyme tied to cell division, encoded in genes CDK4 and CDK6. The inhibitors help stop the cancer cells from multiplying.The first of these, Pfizer's (PFE) Ibrance, launched in early 2015 and took in $723 million last year. That's expected to swell into the billions eventually.Eli Lilly (LLY), however, has made some noise with its CDK 4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib, which showed a much higher response rate -- 25% -- in refractory patients than did Ibrance. In the ASCO abstract on Lilly's Monarch-1 trial, after eight months of treatment that number was only 17%, still better than Ibrance but a slight disappointment to Wall Street.At Lilly's R&D day on Tuesday, though, the company said it will also be presenting 12-month data at ASCO, so there could still be an upside surprise. Nonetheless, Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum wrote that Lilly executives didn't seem that enthusiastic.""Lilly seemed to not want to boost investor expectations with regards to the 12-month data, and therefore reiterated the 17% ORR results (reported at eight months) when asked,"" Schoenebaum wrote in an email to clients. ""Additionally, Lilly encouraged investors to also look at overall clinical benefit and duration of response during the presentation at ASCO.""Hovering in the background, though not at ASCO, is the Novartis (NVS) announcement May 18 that it had stopped its late-stage trial of its own CDK drug early because it had already hit its primary endpoint of improvement in PFS. The details on that will have to wait for a later medical meeting.""That's also a positive development for the space,"" analyst Divan told IBD. ""There's room for more than one winner.""Meanwhile, Pfizer scored a hit for its treatment with late-stage data showing that Ibrance in combination with estrogen blocker letrozole yielded PFS of more than 20 months, or 10 months more than letrozole alone.This prodded analyst Fernandez to raise his 2025 sales estimate for the whole CDK 4/6 class to $13 billion from $10 billion, and his 2021 estimate for Ibrance sales alone to $8.3 billion from $6 billion.Among the late-breaking data in other fields, one study that many on Wall Street are eyeing is the midstage trial of Rova-T, a drug that AbbVie is acquiring through the $5.8 billion buyout of biotech Stemcentryx. Rova-T is a treatment for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), a smaller market than the enormous NSCLC population but a definite opportunity since it lacks a specifically approved treatment.Previous studies have shown a 44% response rate in relapsed patients with high expression of delta-like protein 3 (DLL3), which appears in 80% of SCLC patient tumors. The presentation at ASCO is particularly important because Stemcentryx will be reporting long-term survival data, which is the gold standard in cancer trials as far as the FDA is concerned.Analyst Schoenebaum says Rova-T will have to improve survival enough to differentiate itself.""We know that chemotherapy produces around six months' OS (overall survival) in the setting that they're testing Rova-T in,"" Schoenebaum said in a video recorded for clients on May 23. ""And we know that there was some data in the ASCO abstracts (showing) PD-1 plus Yervoy produced about eight months, but (with) a lot of toxicity.... But the punchline is we need to see OS data well in excess of six months.""AbbVie has estimated that peak annual sales of Rova-T could hit $5 billion.

382,PFE,"Shares of biotech Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) plummeted to a nearly three-year low Thursday after its partner GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) said it won't pursue a late-stage trial of Ionis' rare-disease drug. The news lifted Alnylam (ALNY), which has a rival drug in testing.There were already signs of trouble back on April 7, when the FDA place a clinical hold on the companies' phase-two trial of Ionis-TTR, a treatment for a rare but deadly inherited condition called familial amyloid cardiomyopathy (FAC), a subtype of a larger condition called TTR amyloidosis. The FDA wanted Glaxo to answer questions about the trial's patient-monitoring protocols following reports of falling platelet counts, or thrombocytopenia, in another trial of Ionis-TTR in a different type of TTR amyloidosis called familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP).The latter trial was already underway while the FAC trial was still in the planning phase. It was this trial that Glaxo decided not to initiate. The FAP trial is ongoing, and Glaxo will consider the options for FAC once it has more data, Ionis said.Ionis stock had plummeted by 39.4% by the close on the stock market today, to 21.36. It's off roughly 70% from its 52-week high hit last June. Glaxo stock was off a few cents to 43.09.In a May 4 research note, Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt wrote that it wasn't clear if the drug was actually causing the platelet problem or if the problem came from the disease itself. However, comparisons with other trials weren't encouraging.""Of note Alynlam hasn't see any thrombocytopenia in either of its two TTR phase-two trials in FAC and FAP, respectively (52 patients combined),"" Schmidt wrote. ""Similarly, Pfizer's (PFE) phase-three trial of tafamidis in FAP also did not indicate any thrombocytopenia to our knowledge, raising the question whether this signal is due to the antisense technology.""Severe thrombocytopenia, however, was an issue for Prosensa's drisapersen (now known as BioMarin's (BMRN) Kyndrisa), which is based on similar chemistry as Ionis' drugs.""Alnylam stock jumped more than 11% at the close to 70.57. Pfizer was up a fraction, to 34.43. BioMarin fell 1.6%, to 87.26.

383,PFE,"Walt Disney (DIS), Macy's (M), Gap (GPS), Kohl's (KSS), Fossil (FOSL) and others reported weak earnings or guidance, triggering a broad sell-off in retail and other consumer stocks -- but not for shares of Amazon (AMZN). Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) tumbled to a two-year low amid fresh evidence that iPhone demand remains weak. The major indexes ultimately closed modestly lower, with the S&P 500 and Dow industrials falling below key support.The major averages fell for a third straight week, with most or all of the losses coming Friday. The Dow fell 1.2% and the S&P 500 0.5%, both closing below their 50-day moving averages for the first time since Feb. 29. The Nasdaq, already below that key line, retreated 0.4%. The market uptrend remains under pressure. Retail and consumer groups were big losers after a raft of weak earnings reports and guidance from the likes of Walt Disney and Macy's. Oil prices rose to six-month highs during the week.Retail sales rose 1.3% in April, their best gain in more than a year. But that couldn't shake the gloom surrounding retail and consumer stocks.Macy's, Kohl's, Nordstrom (JWN), JCPenney (JCP) and Dillard's (DDS) tumbled on dismal first-quarter reports and/or guidance. Macy's and upscale Nordstrom slashed outlooks after sharp EPS declines. Kohl's posted a same-store sales drop that was the worst ""since the height of the Great Recession,"" according to Retail Metrics.Macy's stock fell 17% to a four-year low, and Kohl's fell nearly 14%, setting to its seven-year worst. Nordstrom, JCPenney and Dillard's lost 18.5%, 8% and 11%, respectively.Meanwhile, watchmaker and seller Fossil collapsed 31% after missing Q1 views and slashing guidance. Fossil hinted at competition from the Apple Watch and other wearables. Gap said Q1 same-store sales sank 5%, with April comps down 7% ahead of its full Q1 results on May 19. Its shares plunged nearly 19% to the worst since late 2011.Wal-Mart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), Ross Stores (ROST) also continue the flood of retail earnings next week.The media conglomerate delivered its first earnings miss in five years as per-share profit grew 11% to $1.36 and revenue grew 4% to $12.97 billion, short of consensus. ESPN lost subscribers once again, but the media networks segment didn't appear to disappoint Wall Street too badly. Studio revenue shot up 22% on ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" and ""Zootopia"" fanfare. ""Captain America: Civil War"" should keep movie box office receipts high in Q2.Disney shares tumbled 4.8% to 100.52, falling out of a cup-with-handle base and well out of buy range. Disney closed just above its 50-day line.Apple stock fell last week amid new evidence that Apple suppliers are seeing weak orders for the upcoming iPhone 7. That suggests Apple's sales woes may continue for quite some time. Separately, Apple will invest $1 billion in Didi Chuxing, a Chinese ride-hailing service and app. Apple stock fell 2.4% to its lowest level since June 2014 and lost its market cap crown, barely, to Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL).Amazon intensified its rivalry with Alphabet’s Google by launching a new video streaming service comparable to YouTube. Sanford Bernstein analyst Carlos Kirjner on Tuesday raised his price target on Amazon to a whopping 1,000.Wal-Mart (WMT) announced its subscription service would offer two-day free delivery vs. three days before. But, as brick-and-mortar retailers struggle, Amazon rose 5.3% to 709.92, with investors betting its share of consumer spending will keep expanding.Facebook released guidelines revealing that the social media giant relies far more on people for its ""trending"" news topics, contradicting earlier company claims that they were largely driven by computer algorithms. Earlier, Gizmodo suggested that Facebook was suppressing news stories from conservative media outlets. Facebook strongly denied the allegation, saying it has “rigorous guidelines in place” for its review team, seeking to ensure consistency and neutrality.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he would meet with conservatives to discuss Facebook's policies.Facebook stock rose 0.3% to 119.81 for the week, extending a recent breakout but still in buy range.Staples (SPLS) and Office Depot (ODP) called off their proposed merger late Tuesday after a federal judge agreed with the Federal Trade Commission that the deal would have limited office supply competition with big corporate customers. Staples crashed 19%, and Office Depot dropped 40%. The Obama administration has blocked several megamergers recently, including that of Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI). Analysts say health insurance consolidation could get a hard look, with Aetna (AET) seeking to buy Humana (HUM), and Anthem (ANTM) set to acquire Cigna (CI).The Treasury Department on Tuesday called for greater oversight of the nascent industry, whose quick, easy online payment and lending solutions threaten to upend traditional banking but have raised questions about safeguards and potential for abuse.That came a day after Lending Club (LC) said CEO Renaud Laplanche was stepping down after the company found misconduct within the online lending platform relating to loan sales and lack of financial oversight. Several large and small banks halted work with Lending Club. Shares shed 51%, hitting a record low.Peer-to-peer lending firm Prosper recently announced a large round of layoffs, and disappointing quarterly results from OnDeck (ONDK) have prompted worries over insufficient loan-volume growth.Online gaming platform NetEase (NTES) more than doubled revenue in Q1, beating estimates, boosted by mobile games such as “Fantasy Westward Journey” and newer releases such as “Kung Fu Panda 3.” EPS also topped. Shares rose 9.3% for the week, moving above the 200-day line.Weibo (WB), a Twitter (TWTR)-like social-media platform majority owned by Sina (SINA), fared well, helped by mobile-user growth, strong ad revenue and expansion beyond major cities. Shares rose 2.1% for the week.Online media company Sina itself also topped Q1 views, with better sales and a narrower net loss than expected. The strong Weibo performance was a key help. But ad revenue from its Web portal segment lagged. Shares lost 11.2%, plunging through the 50-day line but closing just above the 200-day.Online retailer JD.com (JD) reported a Q1 loss in line with expectations. Sales surged but were just below expectations, and Q2 revenue guidance was just shy of analysts’ consensus. Shares tumbled 10.2%.LGI Homes (LGIH) on Tuesday reported a surprisingly strong 73% surge in first-quarter adjusted earnings per share. But the entry-level homebuilder's revenue fell short, and gross profit margins declined. LGI Homes, which briefly flirted with a 29.87 buy point, fell 8.9% to 25.69.Trex (TREX), the world’s largest maker of wood-alternative decking and railing products, topped Q1 views. But Trex guided Q2 revenue below consensus. Shares reversed hard, down 9.6% this week.Gypsum wallboard and related products maker Continental Building Products (CBPX) Q1 profit climbed 173%. Shares rose 7.5%, breaking out of a base to a seven-month high. TopBuild (BLD), which installs building insulation, also bested Wall Street Q1 earnings and revenue estimates. Shares of the July 2015 IPO rose 2.8% after the prior week's breakout.Several housing reports, including housing starts and existing-home sales for April, are on tap for next week.SolarCity (SCTY) torched Wall Street’s Q1 sales views late Monday, but losses swelled, and the No. 1 residential installer cut 2016 installation guidance as bookings fell short after Nevada cut net-metering payments to solar customers.Also Monday, rival Vivint Solar (VSLR) reported a 93% revenue rise that still missed views as losses widened.But No. 2 installer Sunrun (RUN) late Thursday reported a surprise Q1 profit ex items, while revenue nearly doubled.SolarCity fell 10.3% for the week, while Vivint was off nearly 8.9%, hitting record lows. Sunrun was down nearly 12%, even with Friday's 7.5% pop.Israeli giant Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) beat Q1 earnings and sales estimates, but it guided Q2 slightly below consensus. Teva said its $40 billion buyout of the Allergan (AGN) generics business is on track to close in June, despite some earlier delays. Teva stock rose 3 cents to 50.30 for the week.Allergan reported mixed Q1 results -- earnings beat and sales missed -- but the drugmaker said it'll buy $10 billion in stock. Allergan, fresh off a failed takeover by Pfizer (PFE), signaled it'll focus more on improving operations than on making big buyouts in the near future. Shares rose 10.8%.A third generics giant, Perrigo (PRGO), hit a four-year low after its Q1 report on Thursday, though since it issued guidance last month there were few surprises. Perrigo fell 4.4% for the week, working on its fifth straight weekly loss.Smaller player Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) missed estimates, but its stock rose on news of a deal with two generic drugmakers not to sell knock-offs of its lead drug Xyrem until the end of 2025. Jazz shares closing up 0.9%. Meanwhile, Akorn (AKRX) finally reported its 2015 numbers after a long accounting overhaul, lifting shares more than 20%. It’s set to report its Q1 on May 17.JAB Beech will add Krispy Kreme Doughnuts (KKD) to its coffee empire, paying $21 per share, or $1.35 billion. Krispy Kreme shot up 25% to 21.14 --- slightly above the offer price. JAB Beech, a subsidiary of JAB Holding, owns Peet’s Coffee & Tea, Stumptown Coffee Roasters, Caribou Coffee, Einstein Noah Restaurant Group and Intelligentsia Coffee. It led an investor group to buy Keurig Green Mountain for $13.9 billion.
"
384,PFE,"Nike (NKE) has more U.S. patents than a defense contractor making stealth jets, a pharma developing cancer-fighting drugs, and an auto giant working on self-driving cars.The athletic gear maker was granted about 500 patents last year and ended 2015 with 5,060 issued patents, which include those that expired, according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). That tops Lockheed Martin (LMT) (4,113), Ford Motor (F) (3,563) and Pfizer (PFE) (2,587). And that doesn’t even include patent applications.Nike’s patents have nearly doubled since 2009, and CEO Mark Parker boasted last year the company has the third-largest U.S. portfolio of design patents. Nike has buried rivals Adidas and Under Armour (UA) in patents, as it looks to maintain its dominance with an avalanche of innovations in manufacturing and design while potentially toying with a wearable device that could appear alongside Apple's (AAPL) smartwatches and Fitbit's (FIT) trackers.""Generally, you should see some type of correlation when a company is releasing innovative, game-changing products,” said Envision IP Managing Attorney Maulin Shah, who said that of Nike’s thousands of granted patents, over 4,200 of them are still active and in force.As Nike doubles down on automation and 3D printing capabilities, a recent Macquarie analysis of the USPTO library observed “a meaningful acceleration of (Nike) patents in recent months focusing on new ways to manufacture products.”Nike already has its own army of shoe-painting and water-free dyeing robots, just to name a few. And in October, it announced a partnership with Flextronics (FLEX), a manufacturer that has developed an automated way to cut material waste by 50%. Such savings, if flowed to the bottom line, could add 23 cents to Nike's 2016 earnings per share, Macquarie analyst Laurent Vasilescu estimated in April.Separately, Nike is building a “3D digital design system” in partnership with DreamWorks Animation (DWA) that includes “nearly instantaneous digital print applications, photo-real 3D visualizations and ultra-rapid prototyping.”Compared to Nike's more than 4,200 active patents, German rival Adidas has “kind of been stagnant,” with a U.S. patent portfolio that is about a ninth the size of Nike’s, not including those gained in its acquisition of golf equipment maker TaylorMade, said Shah. But Adidas does have a “relatively large” patent portfolio in Europe, he noted. Globally, Nike has about 19,500 patents and patent applications vs. Adidas’ roughly 2,400.Under Armour, which has been happy to be framed as a tech company with a penchant for snapping up fitness apps, only has about 104 issued U.S. patents, almost two-thirds of which are design and not utility patents, by Shah's count. Utility patents in athletic apparel primarily deal with material -- think compression, moisture-wicking -- and manufacturing methods vs. patents for clothing designs.Innovation aside, patents can also be an indicator for something far juicier: a peek into a company’s product strategy.For example, Under Armour was granted on March 29 a patent for a one-armed compression sleeve designed to warm a pitcher’s throwing arm between innings -- an interestingly specific item that indicated potential future investments in baseball. Indeed, a few weeks later, the company signed Washington Nationals outfielder Bryce Harper, the reigning National League MVP, to what ESPN said is the biggest endorsement deal ever for a baseball player, though terms weren't disclosed.Source: USPTOWhile most of Nike's recent patent activity is related to manufacturing, a dive into its sprawling portfolio indicates a potential shift in its device strategy.Nike hasn’t been in the wearables business since axing most of its FuelBand team two years ago, and the TomTom-powered Nike+ Sportwatch is no more. Nike instead has been pushing its revamped Nike+ app over any hardware.Some have said the athletic apparel giant is shying away from hardware development because of its partnership with Apple, particularly since its Nike+ app can be used on the Apple Watch. But its patents say otherwise.There has been a ""surge"" in wearable-related applications from Nike in the last two or three years, Shah said, and the company now has 261 active patents related to wearable tech vs. Adidas' 99 and Under Armour's dozen patents.Published with the USPTO recently, images from a patent for an “athletic watch” look an awful lot like the TomTom version of Nike’s watch: a boxy-looking accessory with a perforated band and large numbers. In fact, given the slight aesthetic differences -- an extra button here, a missing button there, a thinner wristband -- the drawings could easily be a newer edition of the Nike+ SportWatch, though it is not clear if that is the case.Both Nike and TomTom did not immediately respond to a request for comment..Source: USPTO“It definitely seems that Nike is keeping its options open on this front,” Macquarie's Vasilescu told IBD after viewing an earlier trio of patent applications for an athletic watch that were published on March 17 and first filed last September.Meanwhile, about 20% of Adidas’ patents are focused on wearables. But such products may never come to market, Shah said, noting that companies also license ideas if they aren't in a position to make gadgets themselves.Given the sheer number of applications that are filed with the USPTO each year – 629,647 in 2015 alone – some might consider it folly to think digging through musty government archives might shed any light on what kind of consumer products could hit shelves.Indeed, trying to decipher a company’s product pipeline by looking at the U.S. patent library is a little bit like astronomy -- both constellations and published patents are maps of the past. Starlight has to travel so far to reach Earth that some of those celestial bodies that appear to be burning in the night sky may already be dead, or dying.Similarly, it takes about 24.6 months on average for filed patent applications to be published on the USPTO database, according to the agency. Most are actually published within a year and a half, Santa Clara University School of Law Assistant Professor Brian Love told IBD, though ideas were conceived and worked on well before a filing.“It’s probably at least two years old, if not more, and then by the time the patent issues, you’re talking about tacking on a couple more years on top of that,"" he said. ""So it is kind of a window into the future, but it’s not that far of a window into the future.”Still, filings can offer clues years in advance. Case in point: Nike rolled out self-lacing Marty McFly-inspired shoes in March, after Nike designer Tinker Hatfield confirmed in early 2014 that power lacing would be unveiled the following year. But the company's “Back to the Future” resurrection could've been foreseen long before that. Nike's first granted patent for an “automatic lacing system” appeared in 2011.Of course, some companies stake out IP turf not for the purpose of developing those ideas, but to thwart competitors’ dreams. This type of defensive patent publishing, as it is known, is not uncommon with tech giants like IBM (IBM) or Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google, say experts.“The consequence of publishing something is that you lose any sort of trade secrets rights you might have in it, but you’re also stopping somebody else from patenting it,” said Love.Watchmaker Swatch has reportedly been on a smartwatch-patent filing spree over the last few years. What it intends to do with them is a mystery.“There’s a lot of rumors in the patent industry: Will Swatch start suing competitors, or are they actually just building up patents because they’re about to launch an entirely new product line?” said Shah.Regardless, no matter what Nike, Under Armour or Adidas wind up bringing to market, all of this patent-filing and R&D means that investors and consumers can likely expect growth from the activewear space.“I think we are in the golden age of tech in the athletic footwear business,” said NPD Group analyst Matt Powell. “I have never seen so many new tech advances (in products and manufacturing) that we are currently seeing. So add that to the fact that there’s a record number of patents and the future looks really bright.”

385,PFE,"Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) was already a diversified biotech before this year but now it can make a new claim to technology that's based on the altered genetics -- of ratsIt may seem distasteful and not very profitable, but it proved to be a turning point when in January the early-stage biotech company acquired OMT, the firm that developed the technology.OMT, which stands for Open Monoclonal Technology, was using rodent DNA to discover human antibodies for therapeutic use. The move gives Ligand another ""avenue of growth"" as it ventures forth into one of the hottest areas of medicine, says Larry Solow, an analyst at CJS Securities.""You can also use animal antibodies to develop drugs for humans using these models,"" Solow told Investor's Business Daily. ""A rat model can lead to a human drug.""Some of the top-selling drugs -- Humira, Remicade, MabThera/Rituxan, Avastin and Herceptin -- used human antibodies in their development.OMT is believed to be the only company in the world to offer three transgenic animal platforms, known by the names OmniRat, OmniMouse and OmniFlic.Since Ligand acquired OMT, three drug companies have licensed the technology: Emergent BioSolutions (EBS), Tizona Therapeutics and ABBA Therapeutics, a Swiss biotech.Those came on top of the 16 licensees that OMT had previously lined up, including biopharma giants Merck (MRK), Pfizer (PFE) and Celgene (CELG), to name a few.Unlike typical licensing partnerships, which provide royalties and milestone payments, OMT's partners have been paying for access to its technology. But they eventually could pay milestone payments and royalties, too.Ligand had expected OMT to add $6 million in revenue this year and $12 million next year, for a total of $113 million-$117 million in 2016 and more than $158 million in 2017.  But that was before the addition of Emergent, Tizona and ABBA to its client list from the deal. Ligand will likely update guidance in its next earnings report, set for May 4.The $178 million OMT deal and positive news on other Ligand-licensed drugs haven’t diminished investor sentiment. Shares have risen roughly 12% this year.In early April, the European Commission approved expanded use of the European version of one of Ligand's two top licensed drugs, Promacta, for use in pediatric patients with a rare blood disorder. The drug is sold by partner Novartis (NVS).In mid-March, licensee Spectrum Pharmaceuticals (SPPI) won U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for Evomela, for use in treating certain cases of multiple myeloma, a form of blood cancer. The drug earns Ligand higher-than-normal royalties of 20%.Positive clinical data this year and beyond on other Ligand-licensed drugs also bodes well for future revenue growth, analysts say.""We anticipate that current revenue streams from partnered products and the broad 'in development' portfolio are poised to drive significant growth in the near and longer term,"" wrote analyst Joseph Pantginis in a recent research note for Roth Capital Partners.In addition to royalties, Ligand already generates significant revenue from a proprietary formulation technology called Captisol, a sugar molecule that helps absorb drugs into the body, especially helpful in those with harmful side effects.But Captisol and other material sales can vary from quarter to quarter depending on when they are needed for clinical trials and commercial use. In the fourth quarter, lower material sales -- $7.2 million vs. $13 million a year earlier -- caused overall revenue to decline to $21.2 million from last year's $23 million.Still, revenue for the full year rose 11% on top of 32% growth in 2014. And royalty revenue in 2015 rose more than 27% to $38.2 million.Lumpy material sales and any related quarterly declines ""do not concern us,"" Solow said.He expects royalty revenue to grow 50% this year and 40% in 2017. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see total revenue rising 65% this year to $119 million and going up 37% next year.Earnings in Q4 rose 10% from the prior year to 66 cents a share. Analysts expect flat EPS growth this year and then a 51% increase next year, to $5.10 a share.Nearly half of Ligand’s drug partnerships are based on Captisol technology, Solow says, including one of its top-two sellers, Kyprolis, used to treat multiple myeloma.Both Kyprolis and Promacta, an oral drug that boosts platelets in the blood, generated sales of more than $500 million last year, Solow says.He figures that Ligand last year received around 6.5% in royalties on Promacta sales vs. Kyprolis’ roughly 2%. Promacta is sold by Novartis, Krypolis by Amgen (AMGN).“Kyprolis could ultimately have bigger commercial potential, but royalties are higher from Promacta, so it’s the more important of the two drugs,” Solow said.Ligand has dozens of other early-stage drugs it has found partners to take to the next stage. They target a multitude of diseases, such as hepatitis, diabetes, cancer, anemia, Alzheimer’s and kidney disease, among others.Ligand has more than 140 partnered programs with over 70 different companies.Ligand essentially passes off the heavy lifting needed to bring drugs to market, enjoying royalties and milestones with relatively little investment costs.Ligand’s cash operating expenses last year totaled around $25 million while their partners spent over $1.1 billion in research and development, says Solow.“It shows the power of their business model,” he said, noting that the company's overhead is relatively low. “If R&D yields commercial drugs, they will get 4% to 5% in royalties.”In 2016, Ligand’s partners are expected to spend close to $2 billion in R&D, he adds, with about half of the growth coming from OMT.With more than 140 “shots on goal” – or partnered programs – Ligand has “numerous avenues” of growth, wrote analyst Drew Jones of Stephens in an initiation report in mid-April. He rated the stock overweight.Jones expects Promacta and Kyprolis to generate more than $200 million in royalties for Ligand over the next few years compared to $38.2 million in 2015. In addition, he estimates that several of the company’s next-biggest programs could provide $750 million in potential royalties as they move into commercialization.“We expect Ligand’s management team to continue its shrewd capital deployment strategy via technology focused acquisitions,” he noted.

387,PFE,"The market wrapped the week on a positive note, ahead of a week likely to be dominated by the Federal Open Market Committee's two-day policy meeting.That meeting ends with a policy announcement Wednesday afternoon that's expected to include an increase in interest rates.The Nasdaq pushed its rally to six days, ending the session up 0.5% and with a 3.5% gain for the week. The S&P 500 also added a sixth up day, rising 0.6% Friday for a 3% weekly gain. The Dow ticked up 0.7%, notching a 3% weekly gain. All three indexes ended the week at fresh highs.

388,PFE,"Shares of rivals Kite Pharma (KITE) and Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) tanked Tuesday following presentations at the annual American Society of Hematology (ASH) conference, but Spark Therapeutics (ONCE) stock enjoyed its third day in the black on ""compelling"" gene therapy data.Kite and Juno are both investigating chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy therapies to treat a variety of cancers. They compete against the likes of Celgene (CELG), Bluebird Bio (BLUE) and Amgen (AMGN). CAR T-cell therapies engineer patients' immune cells to treat cancer.On Monday and Tuesday at ASH, Juno and Kite presented results of CAR T-cell therapies to battle aggressive non-Hodgkins lymphoma. On the face of those results, Juno's treatment is stronger, showing an 80% overall response and 60% complete response vs. Kite's 76% objective response and 47% complete response.But RBC analyst Michael Yee is skeptical.""Competitive-wise coming away from ASH, Juno's JCAR-017 does not look significantly better than Kite's lead KTE-C19, and Kite is at least one year ahead, in our view,"" he wrote in a research report. ""Juno is saying on market 'as early as 2018' but we believe this will be a stretch and think 2019-plus.""IBD'S TAKE: Allergan recently bought into the gene therapy world with its acquisition of RetroSense Therapeutics. But analysts say the two companies' approaches differ. Meanwhile, Allergan's CEO has pledged to abstain from ""predatory"" pricing in gene therapy.Yee is awaiting six-month data from Kite. Juno saw complete response drop to 42% at month three and another CR fall at the six-month mark, he wrote in a research report. This suggests there could be some ""erosion"" for Kite six months out, ""but anything above 25%-30% is still very good.""Juno's strong Non-Hodgkin lymphoma results follow the deaths of two patients in a CAR T-cell trial for relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Juno temporarily placed that trial on clinical hold and shares toppled 24.5% on Nov. 23 as a result.Despite the strong results, Kite and Juno stocks fell on the stock market today. Kite stock fell 4.7% to 51.10, after earlier plunging as much as 7.2%. Yee blamed short-sellers taking profits for the deluge.Juno stock toppled as much as 8.3% to a record low, ending the day down 4%, at 19.60.Spark stock, on the other hand, continued to gain Tuesday. Shares rose 14% to 57.56, up for a third day following Spark and Pfizer's (PFE) hemophilia B gene therapy presentation on Sunday. Spark made its IPO in 2015, with shares priced at 23.Hemophilia B patients have missing or defective factor IX, a clotting protein. Seven patients infused with Spark and Pfizer's gene therapy, SPK-9001, showed a mean factor IX activity level greater than 28%, 12 weeks post infusion.The first patient to reach one year post treatment showed factor IX levels at 33% of normal, Spark said.Key opinion leaders (KOLs) in a lunch with Yee called Spark and Pfizer's therapy ""compelling."" If phase 3 data shows factor IX above 30%, ""then KOLs will absolutely consider this for patients,"" he wrote.RELATED:Celgene, Kite, Spark Look To Sidestep Eli Lilly's Alzheimer's Flop

389,PFE,"Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen said the case for a rate hike is stronger now, but investors weren't sure what to make of that. Pfizer (PFE) paid $14 billion for a one-drug biotech, but shares of drugs and pharma supply chain companies sold off as Mylan's (MYL) EpiPen price hikes drew outrage. Best Buy (BBY) earnings surprised investors, while dollar stores came under pressure.For the week, the Nasdaq fell 0.4%, the S&P 500 0.7% and the Dow 0.8%. The major averages are still in sideways action. Drug stocks were big movers on Pfizer's Medivation (MDVN) deal and Mylan's EpiPen furor. Dollar stores suffered heavy losses as competition from Wal-Mart (WMT) was heating up.Fed Chair Janet Yellen said at Friday's long-awaited speech that the case for an interest rate hike has ""strengthened in recent months."" That followed other modestly hawkish statements from fellow Fed policymakers. However, Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said Yellen's comments were consistent with a September rate increase. He saw the possibility of two rate hikes this year. Markets had already priced a Fed move, perhaps in December, but they don't expect any quick follow-upNew-home sales soared to a 654,000 annual rate in July, by far the highest since October 2007, the Commerce Department reported. The 12% rise from June surprised economists looking for a slight dip to 580,000. Luxury homebuilder Toll Bros. (TOL) confirmed that the high end of the market is prospering, reporting a 69% jump in third-quarter earnings per share, a 23.5% rise in revenue and a strong backlog of orders. Existing-home sales fell more than expected in July, though that was from June's cycle high. But applications for loans to buy a home fell to a six-month low. Toll shares soared to a seven-month high, moving above their 200-day moving average.The generic drugmaker Mylan sold off 11.55% for the week as members of the Senate and other politicians started inquiring into its price increases on its emergency allergy drug/device EpiPen. That fueled selling in drug and biotech stocks. Mylan CEO Heather Bresch, daughter of Sen. Joe Machin, D-W.V., said only a fraction of the $608 list price makes it back to Mylan, due to all the middlemen, leading shares of Express Scripts (ESRX), CVS Health (CVS) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC) to fall as well.Big pharma Pfizer agreed to buy Medivation for $14 billion in cash, snatching the cancer-drug specialist from Sanofi (SNY), which had been trying for months to acquire Medivation. Biotechs rallied Monday on the news, with BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) jumping on rumors that it was Sanofi's second choice of target. On Wednesday, Pfizer agreed to buy the antibiotics business of AstraZeneca (AZN) for $725 million plus possible future milestone and sales payments and royalties that could amount to $850 million.Oil prices may be settling into a trading range in the mid to high $40 range. OPEC members gave conflicting signals over whether they might support a production freeze, while Goldman Sachs said such a move would not ""be sufficient to support prices much further."" Meanwhile, the Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude inventories rose by 2.5 million barrels vs. expectations for a small drop. Domestic production fell slightly.The road to self-driving cars got a little more crowded as Mobileye (MBLY) announced it will partner with General Motors (GM) supplier Delphi Automotive (DLPH) to jointly develop off-the-shelf autonomous driving technology for automakers. The two companies will co-develop ""the market's first turnkey Level 4/5 automated driving solution."" Mobileye already has deal with BMW (BMWYY) and Intel (INTC) to bring an autonomous vehicle to market by 2021.Mobileye shares spiked Tuesday on the Delphi news, briefly topping a buy point. Shares rose 2.3% for the week.Tesla Motors (TSLA), which is ending its business relationship with Mobileye, introduced new versions of its Model S and X that boosts speeds and driving range, powered by an updated battery technology. Tesla said its upgraded Model S is now the fastest-accelerating car in commercial production. Tesla shares fell 2.2%, closing below the 50-day line and just above the 200-day line.Tesla partner Nvidia (NVDA) unveiled a new processor for autonomous driving, saying it's 50%-100% more powerful than other mobile processors.The beauty products retailer reported better-than-expected earnings and sales, with yet another quarter of double-digit same-stores growth. Ulta Beauty (ULTA) also raised full-year EPS guidance. But its Q3 profit range was a little cautious. Ulta shares have been on a strong run-up, so it may have been priced for perfection. Ulta shares tumbled 6% on Friday, undercutting its 50-day moving average.Workday (WDAY) reported a wider-than-expected Q2 adjusted loss. But it topped on some key metrics, including revenue, which rose 34% to $377.7 million. But shares of the cloud-based human resources software maker rose 2.5%, hitting a 2016 high on Thursday.July IPO Talend (TLND) lost an adjusted $1.84 a share, according to its late Thursday release, but the French Big Data firm later clarified that the bottom line actually met estimates for a loss of 31 cents a share after adjusting for the share count following its initial offering. Revenue rose 38% to $25.4 million, just beating. Talend sees Q3 losses in line with views, but it guided revenue slightly higher. Shares fell 4% after much bigger intraday losses.Best Buy (BBY) stock jumped 21% for the week to a 17-month high on better-than-expected sales and earnings for its fiscal second quarter, including a surprise increase in same-store sales. The consumer electronics retailer credited rising demand for wearable technology, appliances and home-theater systems for the increase. Video game and electronics retailer GameStop (GME) disappointed investors with in-line EPS and below-forecast sales.Discount retailers Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) suffered double-digit share price losses, as both reported second-quarter results that came up short of Wall Street expectations, with falling grocery prices and tougher competition hurting sales. Those results came as Wal-Mart is waging its own campaign to cut prices, a move that could draw more customers who have become more cautious with their spending.Meanwhile, the jeweler Tiffany (TIF) held to its full-year outlook, while its Q2 EPS beat views, helping to boost shares. However, Signet Jewelers (SIG), the parent of mall jewelers Kay, Jared and Zales, slashed its fiscal-year outlook, partly due to difficulties ""in the energy-dependent regions."" Those regions' economies have been hurt by cheap oil and other commodities.HP Inc. (HPQ) reported that its fiscal Q3 earnings per share minus one-time items jumped 37% in fiscal Q3 to 48 cents on a 4% decline in sales to $11.89 billion, both better than views. For the current quarter, the printer and PC maker sees non-GAAP EPS of 34-37 cents, vs. consensus for 41 cents. HP is reducing its printing supplies inventory and is deeply discounting printers to expand its installed base. Shares closed little changed after a brief Thursday morning sell-off.

390,PFE,"Drug industry mergers and acquisitions continued Wednesday as two pharma companies sold off non-core assets.British giant AstraZeneca (AZN) agreed to sell its small-molecule (i.e. non-biotech) antibiotics to Pfizer (PFE) for an upfront payment of $550 million plus another $175 million in January 2019, along with up to $250 million in milestone payments depending on whether the drugs still in the pipeline make it to market.The portfolio includes the already-commercialized drugs Merrem, Zinforo and Zavicefta, which treat a range of serious infections, as well as two late-stage pipeline candidates for drug-resistant infections. Allergan (AGN) holds the North American rights to Zavicefta and Zinforo and will continue to do so, with Pfizer acquiring the international rights.IBD'S TAKE: Pfizer's size and patent losses have kept it from being a big growth stock lately, but it's a leading dividend stock, as outlined recently in IBD's column The Income Investor.The move fits AstraZeneca's strategy of focusing on its three chosen areas of oncology, respiratory/autoimmunity, and cardiovascular/metabolic diseases. For Pfizer, it adds to its existing portfolio of more than 60 anti-infectives.""As we continue to reshape our Essential Health portfolio, we are focusing on areas that further address global public health needs and that complement our core capabilities and experience in therapeutic areas,"" John Young, head of Pfizer Essential Health, said in a statement.The deal is expected to close in Q4.Pfizer stock closed 0.8% lower at 34.82 on the stock market today. AstraZeneca stock fell 1% to 33.50.Meanwhile, specialty drugmaker Mallinckrodt (MNK) said it's selling its diagnostic nuclear-imaging business to Belgium-based IBA Molecular for $690 million.The fact that Mallinckrodt has two not-especially-related businesses -- specialty drugs and imaging -- comes from its peculiar history. It was a more diversified company when Tyco International (TYC) bought it in 2000, but after Tyco spun off its medical business as Covidien (now part of Medtronic (MDT)) in 2007, and then Covidien spun off Mallinckrodt in 2013, the other divisions were stripped off. Since the spinoff, the drug business has been growing much faster than the imaging business, so a sale has been widely expected.The deal has to clear some unusual regulatory hurdles, including approval from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, so the companies say it will close in the first half of 2017.Mallinckrodt stock dropped 4.7% to 79.14 after setting an 11-month high intraday.RELATED:Pfizer-Medivation Deal Reignites Biotech Buyout Speculation3 More Drugmakers Beat Q2 Estimates, But Guidance Mixed
"
391,PFE,"Drug stocks slipped Wednesday after rallying earlier in the day, as the politics of drug pricing resurfaced.The IBD Biotech/Biomedical group hit a seven-month high Wednesday morning, as the group continued the momentum started by Monday announcement of Pfizer's (PFE) deal to buy Medivation (MDVN). This raised hopes for more biotech M&A, which continued -- especially for Incyte (INCY) and BioMarin (BMRN), after Gabelli & Co. argued that they made especially attractive targets.Incyte rose more than 7% in early trading on the stock market today but ended the day up just a fraction, at 82.44. BioMarin initially gained almost 9% but then sharply reversed, ending down 4.3%, at 95.13.The proximate cause for the decline seemed to be presidential candidate Hillary Clinton criticizing generic-drug giant Mylan (MYL) for its pricing of allergy treatment EpiPen. While Mylan's multiple price hikes on EpiPen had already attracted discussion within the industry, this week the U.S. Senate got in on the act, demanding that Mylan CEO Heather Bresch explain EpiPen's high price. Clinton weighed in around midday Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: When the long-term outlook gets cloudy, look to IBD's Swing Trader for tips on short-term trading.As we noted this month, the biotech stock rally of the last eight weeks might have been driven partly by the fact that drug pricing had faded within the political debate. The group hit a seven-month high on Aug. 4, which it surpassed early Wednesday.RBC Capital Markets analyst Randall Stanicky wrote in a research note that drug pricing's comeback in politics could be with us for a while.""This is also a stark reminder that political scrutiny on pricing remains high across the sector and unlikely to dissipate anytime soon as we head toward the November election,"" Stanicky wrote.Nonetheless, for those familiar with IBD's chart-reading techniques, there are still leading biotechs that are worth keeping an eye on. Incyte has been bouncing around between the buy and sell zones since it popped out of a cup-with-handle base last month; its financials are also improving, as it's turned more consistently profitable over the last few quarters.Biogen (BIIB) also broke out of a cup-with handle at the start of this month and then blasted right past its buy point the next day on buyout rumors. Since then it's moved sideways, but Wednesday's reversal brought it close to the buy zone again, as it was down more than 3% near 308.Celgene (CELG) has been on the upslope of a consolidation that started in July of last year, and it still hasn't formed a specific buy point. Both Celgene and Biogen are strong stocks overall with Composite Ratings putting them in the top 6% of all stocks.The Generic Drugs group also has been rallying over the last eight weeks, though it's still low-ranked, going from No. 191 to No. 176 on IBD's list on 197 industry groups. The group was up again Wednesday after Lannett (LCI) beat Q4 expectations late Tuesday. Lannett stock jumped 14% Wednesday. Generic drugs, however, are the most direct target of the Senate inquiry. The group fell 2.6% Wednesday after earlier hitting a six-month high. Mylan stock fell 5.5% Wednesday after falling 4.8% Tuesday.RELATED:Hunting For Biotech Stocks?

392,PFE,"Stocks opened flat to slightly lower Wednesday, amid an early pullback in oil prices and a weak reading on June home prices.The Dow industrials and S&P 500 fell less than 0.1%. The Nasdaq was flat. The stock market today opens with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 slightly ahead so far for the week, but with a heavy slate of economic news due out Thursday and Friday.IBD 50 stocks largely held their ground. Dow stocks had a positive lean, with Pfizer (PFE) topping the upside -- up 0.2% after announcing it would pay $1.58 billion plus royalties for AstraZeneca's (AZN) small-molecule antibiotics unit.  AstraZeneca shares rose 0.7%.Intuit (INTU) fell 3% after reporting stronger-than-expected fiscal Q4 results, but also guiding Q1 EPS and revenue well below the consensus estimate.Lannett (LCI) swept ahead 20% after the open. The generic drugmaker's fiscal Q4 earnings and revenue cleared analysts' targets by a wide margin, and management hoisted its 2017 revenue guidance to well above views. Results were buoyed by Lannett's $1.23 billion acquisition of UCB unit Kremers Urban Pharmaceuticals, closed in November.Telecom construction outfit Dycom (DY) dropped 3%. It reported late Tuesday fiscal fourth quarter sales and earnings that easily cleared analysts' projections. Dycom's revenue guidance for Q1 was in line with consensus views, although the midpoint of EPS guidance was a shade short. Management also lowered expectations for revenue in 2017 from the recently acquired Goodman Networks, but said the unit would produce higher-than previously expected operating earnings for the year.Trendy fashion retailer Express (EXPR) swooned 23% at the open. Second-quarter earnings and revenue declined more than forecast, and comparable sales, online sales and gross margins continued to weaken.La-Z-Boy (LZB) reclined 15.5% after a narrow earnings miss, and a wide shortfall on revenue in its fiscal first-quarter report.The Housing Price Index from the Federal Housing Finance Agency rose 0.2% in June. That was in line with the prior two months' growth, but just shy of expectations for a 0.3% rise, and the second quarter data show what the FHFA release notes as a ""potentially significant market shift."" A 0.2% gain in each of the three months of the quarter, ""is a much more modest pace of appreciation than we've seen in some time and most likely reflects accumulated pressures from significantly reduced home affordability,"" the statement said.

397,PFE,"Drugmaker Endo International (ENDP) plunged 39% Friday after it delivered a hefty guidance cut driven by weakness in its generics business, dragging nearly every other generic-drug stock down with it.Endo actually beat analysts' consensus in Q1, but it cut its full-year earnings guidance by 23% -- now $4.50 to $4.80 a share -- and trimmed the revenue outlook by 11% to a range of $3.87 billion to $4.03 billion. In the company's earnings release, CEO Rajiv De Silva blamed ""new competitive entrants, including for Voltaren Gel; greater-than-expected price erosion across the Generics sector; and delays on regulatory actions related to certain Endo products.""IBD's Take: How healthy are shares of Endo and Teva and how do they stack up vs. rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupIt was the second factor that rattled the rest of the generics industry. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) stock fell 6.8% to 50.22, and hit a 19-month low of 50.01. Allergan (AGN), already staggering from the cancellation of its buyout by Pfizer (PFE), hit a two-year low of 195.50 and ended the day at 201.63, down 4.1%, even though it's selling its generics business to Teva.Perrigo (PRGO), which cut its own guidance last month, fell 4.8%, to 92.42. Smaller drugmaker Akorn (AKRX), down as much as 20%, ended the day off 7.9%, at 22. Akorn, which has fallen way behind on its accounting due to internal issues, late Friday finally set dates for its Q4 and Q1 earnings releases, for May 9 and May 17, respectively.Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz wrote in a research note that Endo's problems read through most directly to Teva, Akorn and Perrigo, and more moderately to Allergan. Essentially, whoever's done the most price-hiking on products representing more than 5% of generic sales lately is in the most trouble.Referring to industrywide data from IMS, Schwartz wrote: ""Based on our analysis, Akorn has taken 13 price increases matching the above criteria (44% of IMS generic sales), Perrigo eight (18% of generic IMS sales) and Endo took 17 (17% of generic IMS sales).""Teva, meanwhile, is due to report its own Q1 earnings and guidance on Monday morning, and Allergan is due before the open the following day.Endo itself got at least four downgrades from Wall Street analysts Friday, mostly to neutral but one to underweight. It ended the day at 16.17, a seven-year closing low.
"
398,PFE,"Before Valeant Pharmaceuticals recently cracked up over accounting and management issues, one of the most controversial aspects of its business model was its attitude toward research and development spending.Valeant (VRX) would typically pare to the bone the R&D operations of companies it acquired, and chided big pharmas for their allegedly wasteful spending on research. Historically its R&D spending was just 3% of sales. By contrast, the R&D budget of Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) last year totaled 36% of sales, Pfizer's (PFE) was nearly 16% and big biotech Celgene's (CELG) was a whopping 40%.But what is really the appropriate spending level for R&D -- and how should it be spent? IBD recently asked Jonathan Gertler, a former biotech entrepreneur who advises companies on just this issue as managing partner of Back Bay Life Science Advisors.IBD: Looking over pharma in general, do you think they're spending the right amount on R&D? Too much? Too little?Gertler: I tend to divide R&D into two categories broadly.There's the R&D that really is focused on new technology, true biologically driven solutions for diseases. I think that level of spending is appropriate. I think increasingly, the collaborations between smaller and larger companies and the collaborations that are truly advancing between companies and academia really are focused on R&D that's going to be meaningful in terms of overall national health and international health, and really driving significant solutions.There is still a tendency, in some companies, to look for follow-on commercial pharmaceutical solutions. You see that ranging from the private equity world all the way up through large pharma and specialty pharma, where it's probably less innovation-driven. And although those dollars are still well spent in terms of the company's viability, in terms of a primary research agenda they're probably less important than the new biologically driven therapies.IBD: Another issue is whether companies want to do the R&D in-house or basically buy it by buying a company. Do you have any general guidelines on that?Gertler: In that I would categorize it into three main groups: the smaller companies that are innovation-driven and somewhat capital-constrained; the midcaps that have had success with aspects of their platform, that either have the chance to focus in on that platform alone, and start to diversify around the platform; and, of course, the global pharma companies.I think there was a lot of emphasis over the last number of years about outsourcing R&D entirely. Our system doesn't work that way. Our system is, at this juncture, a very continuous ecosystem where you have many academics who have gone over to Big Pharma, driving significant R&D efforts; academics who are involved in early-stage companies; and seasoned executives from large companies moving into small companies.The lifeblood of small companies is identifying that which they can really develop, based on either platform or assets, within capital constraints. But then the relationships with the larger companies, where they become the outsourced R&D, is critical. The expertise within those large companies -- which should not be eradicated -- that has to do with R&D, and then ultimately commercial development, should influence the way those smaller companies act.The flip side of that is that large companies that have to focus -- just by the way they're judged by investors on the Street -- on near-term commercial or commercial successes, still have to make sure that the pipeline is intact. If you eradicate R&D functionality from large companies, or significantly hamper it, you won't have the proper means of identifying those smaller platforms that are going to be truly valuable five and 10 years down the line. And also, you won't be able to help those smaller platforms both maintain their own organic growth while at the same time partnering out or licensing out to broaden the way the platform can have an impact.So I think the discussion of outsourced R&D vs. in-house R&D has become artificial. Our world at this juncture is too fluid and too sophisticated to justify that binary type of approach.IBD: There's also been a lot of talk about R&D efficiency, and whether some companies are wasting their resources. What's your impression on that?Gertler: First of all, I think that drug development is by nature a somewhat messy business. You can try to have an extremely strict, receptor-driven drug in development, but inevitably that will either have too small of an impact in terms of disease outcome, or will have too promiscuous effects on other systems, and then have too much collateral damage associated with its development. So inevitably, just by virtue of the biology, there's going to be significant inefficiency in the process.I think that smaller companies sometimes do suffer from inefficiency. Their platforms can be very promising, but smaller companies sometimes lose sight of the best way to prove the concept of the platform, which may be economically smaller and tighter, and yet still really open up the platform once you've gone over that first inflection-point hurdle into larger things.From a large-company perspective, I think there are certainly many steps along the way, whether it's in early-stage discovery or preclinical and early clinical development where many things will help us in the years to come -- and those include biomarkers, and those include imaging processes for diseases and a greater understanding of selective biology for disease -- that will, with the advance of knowledge, make our system more efficient.Doubtless there are inefficiencies in the systems that are due to bureaucracy, and the way things are judged. But I think the primary inefficiency is that drug discovery is, in and of itself, a messy business.IBD: What sort of advice would you give to the nonspecialist investor about judging a company's R&D program?Gertler: If you're looking at large companies, there are a lot of drivers of value for the public investor that probably go well beyond R&D. But I still think that using even a simple formula about percentage of R&D spend is probably not the way investors should look at those companies.I think that they should divide them into two areas. Those that are focused on R&D that's really not primary pharmaceutical or biotech R&D -- it has more to do with either me-too drugs or repurposed or reformulated drugs; I think those are less attractive investments. But if you look at larger companies that are really trying to fill the pipeline in a way that makes clinical sense -- those are the ones (where), regardless of percentage of R&D spend, there is probably greater interest in having long-term support.The reason I say that is that as our health care system changes continually -- and it inevitably will -- we'll have to have systems wherein drugs will have to have higher impact (and) better outcomes, and truly be differentiated to justify reimbursement and support. If you're not a company that's focused on that sort of targeted innovation, in the long run you're not going to do as well.You also have to look at these companies and say, ""What is coming out in terms of news in the near term? And is that news going be impactful to the sector it's targeting?"" Meaning: Is it a me-too drug, or is it a sixth-to-market drug that really is going to (have to) prove huge differentiation to make a difference? I think that would be less appealing. Or is it a drug that actually is addressing a significant unmet need, with a more-than-incremental mechanistic change, and where success there will also offer broader opportunity? Those are still the metrics that, even as as generalist investor in a public pharma company, I would bring to bear.For the midcap companies, I think the same principles apply. And the midcaps, which tend to have less-diversified portfolios, have to have that type of thinking applied to them even more stringently.Image provided by Shutterstock.

400,PFE,"Rare-disease specialist BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) was trading up sharply Wednesday after it reported strong early-stage trial results for its gene therapy for hemophilia.BioMarin delivered a single dose of its candidate BMN 270 to eight patients with severe hemophilia A -- the most common variety of the disease, which makes sufferers' blood unable to clot. Six of those were on the highest dose, and all of those ""improved from severe to either moderate, mild or normal range in terms of factor levels based on World Federation of Hemophilia criteria,"" according to BioMarin's press release.BioMarin is already preparing a large phase-three trial of BMN 270 in hopes of gaining FDA approval as quickly as possible. If successful, it could be a paradigm shift in hemophilia treatment. Currently, the only treatment is regular infusions of natural or recombinant blood-derived products to replace the missing clotting factors. A gene therapy, by attacking the disease's origin in a defective X chromosome, could provide improvement for much longer, although since BioMarin's trial only followed up after 16 weeks, it's unclear just how long it is effective.Currently, hemophilia treatment is dominated by Baxalta (BXLT) -- which is in the process of being acquired by Shire (SHPG) -- and Biogen (BIIB). Both companies are working on their own gene therapies. Pfizer (PFE) holds the dominant position in the smaller hemophilia B market. RBC Capital Markets estimates that the hemophilia A market alone is about $4 billion a year.BioMarin stock was up 5% in early trading on the stock market today, near 90.50, and touched a three-month intraday high. Since last summer, the stock has been hit not only by the larger biotech sell-off, but also by the FDA's rejection in January of its muscular dystrophy drug Kyndrisa, as well as mixed late-stage trial results last month on a treatment for another rare disease, called phenylketonuria. Currently its IBD Relative Strength Rating is a dismal 15, meaning the stock has performed among the lowest 15% of all stocks over the past 12 months.""While the data presented today were small numbers and of relatively limited follow-up ... the data were encouraging (though looks like significant variability from patient to patient) and (1) suggest a path forward for BMN 270 in hemophilia A (and potentially for hemo A gene therapy in general) and (2) set a reasonably high bar for competition that will follow,"" wrote Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum in an email to clients.Image provided by Shutterstock.

401,PFE,"Drug giant Eli Lilly (LLY) is poised for a jolly December, if data and rulings come in positive.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan says all eyes are on new data for Eli Lilly's Solanezumab, an Alzheimer's disease drug that he predicts has a 60% probability of success. Legal decisions and regulatory rulings surrounding Lilly's Jardiance, Alimta and Trulicity also are expected next month.Eli Lilly stock could use a year-end bounce. Shares are down about 10% this year, falling 0.82% to 76.01 on the stock market today. IBD's 44-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group fell more than 1% Tuesday.Phase 3 data from Lilly's Sola is due ""any day now and definitely by year-end,"" Divan wrote in a research report Tuesday. Sola could act as a neuroprotector for patients with Alzheimer's. Its success could boost rival Biogen (BIIB), which has a similar drug in development.Divan predicts Lilly stock could soar more than 20% if Sola shows significant functional benefit, 10% if it shows a trend on function and 5% even if it shows no functional benefit. He predicts a 10%-15% drop if Sola misses on cognition.IBD'S TAKE: December could be jolly for more than just Eli Lilly. Drug stocks have rallied since the election of Donald Trump, who is seen as more business friendly than Hillary Clinton. But what happens if Trump makes good on his promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act? The outlook isn't as certain. Grab IBD's Industry Themes for a deeper dive.In addition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is due to make a decision in December on whether to expand the label on Jardiance, a type 2 diabetes med. The risk is ""skewed to the downside"" as most observers are expecting FDA approval, Divan said.Also, patent litigation is ongoing for Lilly's Alimta, a chemotherapy for cancer in or near the lungs. But most expect the patent to expire in 2021-22, regardless, Divan noted.Also, in coming weeks Lilly is due to release an interim analysis of a study on type 2 diabetes drug Trulicity.But the news flow won't end there. Initial 2017 guidance is expected Jan. 4 and the FDA could approve baricitinib, a rheumatoid arthritis drug in conjunction with Incyte (INCY), by mid-January, he wrote.Baricitinib belongs to a class of drugs called JAK inhibitors. Gilead Sciences (GILD) is working on a JAK inhibitor, as is AbbVie (ABBV). Pfizer (PFE)has one approved and is currently in trials to expand its use. Incyte also has a JAK inhibitor on the market. Janus kinase (JAK) is a family of enzymes. Drugmakers believe blocking these enzymes could treat certain cancers and inflammatory diseases.Editor's Note: Corrects last graph on which companies are working on a JAK inhibitor or already have one on the market.RELATED:Gilead Could Scoop Up Incyte After Cancer Drug Proves 'Not Good Enough'Amgen, Gilead, Eli Lilly Eat Into AbbVie's Humira Sales: Analyst

409,PFE,"Big pharma Pfizer (PFE) said Monday that it's acquiring small biopharma Anacor Pharmaceuticals (ANAC) for $4.5 billion in cash, sending the latter's stock up more than 57% Monday.Pfizer agreed to pay $99.26 a share for Anacor, a 55% premium over Friday's closing price, though shares closed Monday just above 100. The total transaction value is $5.2 billion, assuming the conversion of Anacor's outstanding convertible notes, Pfizer said. Anacor's sole commercial product is a toenail-fungus ointment called Kerydin, distributed by Novartis (NVS), but Pfizer's press release on the merger played up Anacor's eczema treatment crisaborole, which is under FDA review due for completion by Jan. 7.""We believe the acquisition of Anacor represents an attractive opportunity to address a significant unmet medical need for a large patient population with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis, which currently has few safe topical treatments available,"" said Albert Bourla, head of Pfizer's innovative businesses, in the release.Pfizer estimates crisaborole could reach peak annual sales of $2 billion.The buyout adds another asset to Pfizer's innovate drug business, which it is widely expected to separate from its established-products business sometime in the next few years. Pfizer has said that it will make a decision on whether to split by year's end.Pfizer already has a significant presence in inflammation and immunology, including blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis treatments Enbrel (sold in partnership with Amgen (AMGN)) and Xeljanz. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) recently reported strong late-stage data for its injectable drug dupilumab in atopic dermatitis, so while the market is currently underserved, it may soon become more competitive.""It is not easy to make a cross-trial comparison between Crisaborole and Dupi as Regenron's treatment targets moderate-to-severe patients, while Crisa targets mild-to-moderate patients (as well as different routes of administration -- injectable vs. topical -- and a different primary endpoint),"" wrote Evercore IS analyst Mark Schoenebaum in an email to clients, ""but looking at top-line data for Investigator's Global Assessment the drugs are relatively comparable with Dupi appearing to be more effective if corrected for placebo: Dupilumab phase three demonstrated that 36% to 38% achieved clearing or near-clearing of skin lesions after 16 weeks ... compared to 10% and 8.5% with placebo, while (with) Crisaborole 52% (of) patients achieved clearance but at (a) much larger placebo background (30%-40% placebo patients achieved clearance with Crisaborole) after four weeks.""Besides Regeneron, Roche (RHHBY) and AstraZeneca (AZN) both have injectable atopic dermatitis treatments in midstage testing.Anacor stock closed at 100.67 on the stock market today.

411,PFE,"The medical industry has a lot to prove in the upcoming Q1 earnings season, as the last round of earnings and guidance didn't do much to reassure investors who were already nervous for other reasons. However, some major stocks in the sector have been hitting new highs lately, especially on the hardware side of the group. Here are three such companies reporting earnings this week:• Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) takes its traditional place at the head of the line as it reports its earnings early Tuesday, the first of the big drug companies to report in this cycle. Its growth is expected to be modest, due to both its gigantic size and the foreign-exchange headwinds that have been dragging on global companies' earnings this year.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimate that Q1 revenue rose 0.7% over the year-earlier quarter to $17.5 billion. Earnings are estimated at $1.66 a share, up 6%.Despite its muted growth, Johnson & Johnson stock hit a record high of 110.40 in trading Friday (closing the day at 110.18, up a fraction), and has maintained an IBD Relative Strength Rating in the 80s for the last six weeks.The mood on Wall Street going into the quarter seems bullish. Late Thursday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro raised his estimates based on his reading of drug-prescription and foreign-exchange trends.""IMS (IMS) script trends for several key drugs suggest another strong pharma quarter in 1Q (+9% year-over-year ex-FX and Olysio),"" Novarro wrote. (Olysio is a hepatitis C treatment.) ""Additionally, our analysis of currency movements since the beginning of the year suggests the negative FX impact on full-year results should be less than initially expected.""Novarro noted that one likely topic of conversation on the conference call will be this month's FDA approval of Pfizer’s (PFE) Inflectra, a biosimilar version of J&J's blockbuster immunology drug Remicade.• Robotic-surgery specialist Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is due to report after the close Tuesday. Analysts estimate that its Q1 earnings rose 21% over last year's Q1 to $4.33 a share, with sales up 11.5% to $593 million.Intuitive Surgical has also been a top-performing stock lately, as the company has been making a comeback financially with the rollout of its da Vinci Xi surgical system and improving procedure growth. Intuitive Surgical stock hit a new high of 630.67 on Wednesday, up more than 15% this year, and boasts an excellent IBD Composite Rating of 98. It closed Friday at 624.22.""Heading into 1Q, the key question for investors is whether the stock is baking in too much optimism or is this the start of a new product cycle,"" Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar wrote in an email to clients Friday. ""We expect procedure volumes to be healthy, with growth in general surgery leading the way (extra day from leap year should also help).""• Similar concerns about an over-optimistic market seem to be dogging orthopedics giant Stryker (SYK), which is due to report after the close Wednesday. The stock has also been on a roll, on Wednesday hitting a new high of 110.40 that was 19% above where it wound up last year. Shares closed Friday at 109.80.Stryker stock kept climbing last week even though Robert W. Baird downgraded it to neutral and Barclays resumed coverage at underweight. The latter wrote that Stryker's valuation appears to be full going into its Q1 and that it's facing more competition from a rejuvenated Zimmer Biomet (ZBH).Analysts covering Stryker estimate that sales rose 3.9% in the quarter to $2.47 billion, with earnings up 8% to $1.20 a share.

413,PFE,"For a few exchange traded funds at crucial points on their charts, some major earnings announcements this week hold the potential for pivotal moves.Funds in health care, utilities, consumer and solar energy are poised to climb past ceilings. With major pieces of those ETFs releasing quarterly reports, significant moves could loom.To be sure, because ETFs are pools of stocks, the performance of a single component has a limited impact on the whole fund. Yet a blowout report or big disappointment can change the course of a sector ETF. For example, Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) gapped down 2% on April 22 -- the fund’s largest percentage move since March 1 -- after Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL), two of the fund’s top five holdings, slid on weak quarterly results.The Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) ETF finds itself in a critical spot as it tries to regain its footing after dropping below its 50-day moving average. Its success in rising from that key level rests partly on how three companies will fare with their latest reports.Duke Energy (DUK), the ETF’s second-largest holding at more than 8% of the whole fund, is reporting Q1 results Tuesday before the open. Analysts expect a profit of $1.14 a share as the Charlotte, N.C.-based utility continues an uneven profit performance.On Wednesday, Dominion Resources (D) releases its earnings at 10 a.m. ET. The consensus estimate is 94 cents a share. Exelon (EXC) comes out with results Friday at 11 a.m. ET, and Wall Street is expecting a profit of 68 cents a share. Dominion and Exelon account for 7% and 5.4% of the fund, respectively.A lot of the top companies in the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) ETF have already reported, but two big ones are on deck this week.Pfizer (PFE) reports Tuesday and Merck (MRK) on Thursday before the open. The drugmakers are the second- and third-largest components of the ETF, which is nearing a key level. Shares are approaching the December peak at 73.16. A move above that level would be bullish.Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR’s (XLY) second-largest component, Home Depot (HD), will announce May 17. Disney (DIS) releases its results after the close on May 10. Both heavyweights account for about 7% of the ETF and are among its top three holdings. The ETF is climbing toward new highs as it makes a steady advance.Guggenheim Solar’s (TAN) largest component, SolarCity (SCTY), releases first-quarter earnings after the market’s close May 9. The solar panel installer accounts for more than 7% of the ETF. The fund’s chart is testing resistance around 25, a level that it must conquer if it’s to continue a recovery from a deep decline.

This will result in a lower adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin in the first quarter, which we would expect to sequentially increase as we move through the year.""Horizon also confirmed full-year 2016 sales guidance of $1.025 billion-$1.05 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters anticipate $1.03 billion in revenue for the year.Shares slid crashed 26.3% on the stock market today, slicing downward through the key moving average.

415,PFE,"The future of the $160 billion merger between big pharma Pfizer and Ireland-based Allergan seemed to be unraveling Tuesday after the U.S. Treasury Department proposed new rules to take away the tax benefits of the deal.Late Monday, Treasury announced an action designed to curb tax inversions, deals in which a U.S. company like Pfizer merges with a smaller foreign company like Allergan so it can relocate to the lower-tax foreign domicile. The Pfizer-Allergan agreement, announced in November, was the latest and biggest of a series of such deals over the past few years that have drawn increasing criticism from politicians.At a press briefing Tuesday, President Obama voiced his approval of the new rules.""I've been pushing for years to eliminate some of the injustices in our tax system,"" Obama said. ""So I'm very pleased that the Treasury Department has taken new action to prevent more corporations from taking advantage of one of the most insidious tax loopholes out there, and fleeing the country just to get out of paying their taxes.""Obama also urged Congress to pass legislation to create a more comprehensive solution, including lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate to a level more like other countries'. Many CEOs of inverted companies have also urged this.Allergan stock fell 15%, to 236.55, in the stock market today.Wall Street analysts agreed that the big downside surprise to the Treasury action was the proposed rule regarding ownership. Under current law, if a U.S. company merges with a foreign company and ends up owning more than 80% of the foreign company, it cannot officially relocate to the foreign company's home country. The way the accounting works now, the Pfizer-Allergan merger would end up with Pfizer owning 56% of the new company, while Allergan would own 44%.Allergan as it is today is a fairly new entity. Back in 2013, the New Jersey drugmaker then known as Actavis acquired Irish counterpart Warner Chilcott, giving it the coveted Dublin address. Since then, it has bought more companies, notably New York-based Forest Laboratories in 2014 and California-based Allergan last year, which led to the name change.The Treasury's guidelines seem to be aimed squarely at Allergan for this. ""For the purposes of computing the ownership percentage when determining if an acquisition is treated as an inversion under current law, today’s action excludes stock of the foreign company attributable to assets acquired from an American company within three years prior to the signing date of the latest acquisition,"" says Treasury's statement.That creates complications.""Here, Allergan (formerly Actavis) is the byproduct of two acquisitions (Forest and legacy Allergan) by Actavis that led to the issuance of an estimated 200 million to 227 million shares of Allergan,"" wrote Leerink analysts Jason Gerberry and Seamus Fernandez in a research note. ""If you strip those shares from the pro-forma Pfizer-Allergan share count (at 11.3x multiplier), you end up with Pfizer owning close to 80% of the New Co.""The analysts noted that the buyout deal includes a provision for changes in the tax law -- without a change, the breakup fee is $3.5 billion, but with adverse changes that drops to only $400 million.This ""lowers the probability of the deal closing,"" they concluded. Nonetheless, they added that Pfizer's ownership could come up shy of 80% unless the feds also back out shares related to the Warner-Chilcott deal -- ""but it’s our view that Warner was the original foreign entity, and it is all subsequent deals that get backed out of the ownership test.""However, an unidentified source told Reuters on Tuesday that Pfizer believes Treasury has painted a target on it, so there will unlikely be any escape routes.""Pfizer is aware that the Treasury will keep ruling against any solution it can come up with,"" Reuters quoted its source as saying.By Tuesday afternoon Pfizer had made no formal decision, its only statement being a brief late-Monday press release saying the company is ""conducting a review"" and would say nothing until it's completed.Treasury's proposal also included a provision attacking earnings stripping, in which the foreign parent makes loans to the U.S. subsidiary and deducts the interest payments from earnings. Analysts say this was expected and is not by itself a deal killer.The rules formally took effect April 4, but are not finalized -- they first have to go through a public comment period that could take months, according to Evercore ISI policy analyst Terry Haines. However, Treasury might have the edge if the rules aren't final, Haines says.""Both of these provisions we expect could be subject to litigation from affected companies, but an affected company is not likely to quickly get court relief through a stay of Treasury's proposal,"" Haines wrote. ""Treasury is carefully limiting its earning stripping action to a 'proposed regulation,' not even a 'temporary regulation' like its other actions today on the 2014 and 2015 proposals.""According to Haines, ""What Treasury is trying to do is avoid court scrutiny while discouraging inversions at the same time: If a rule is only 'proposed' by a regulator, courts reject lawsuits because the government has not taken a final action that definitely harms someone.""On the plus side for Pfizer investors, Evercore drug analyst Mark Schoenebaum said in an email to clients that if the Allergan deal doesn't go through, this could move up the timeline for Pfizer's long-expected split into two companies -- one devoted to innovative drug development and the other established products. That had been pushed into the future when the Allergan deal was announced in November, but Schoenebaum speculates that a decision on that could be made as early as this year.Pfizer stock rose 2.1% Tuesday.As for Allergan, if it doesn't merge with Pfizer it will still be affected by the earnings-stripping provision, which Allergan CEO Brenton Saunders has said could shave profit margins by two or three percentage points. Still, analysts calculated that Tuesday's stock drop brought Allergan well below its stand-alone value.""The updated guidance will put downward pressure on Allergan's stock price, but we continue to view the company as undervalued at its stand-alone price and think its moat is wide, buoyed by a strong and differentiated portfolio along with a solid pipeline,"" wrote Morningstar analyst Damien Conover in a research note.

416,PFE,"No. 2 drugmaker Pfizer's (PFE) sales and earnings are expected to diverge early Tuesday, as it issues its Q3 report amid potentially slowing sales of breast cancer drugs in the U.S., say prescription trackers IMS and Symphony.For Q3, the consensus of analysts polled by FactSet expects Pfizer to report $13.055 billion in sales, down 7% vs. the year-earlier quarter. But they see earnings per share ex items rising 17% to 62 cents.Evercore analyst John Scotti looks for more color on Pfizer's decision earlier this fall to forgo a long-rumored corporate breakup that would have split its innovative and established products businesses.IBD'S TAKE: Pfizer's mega-deal to buy Allergan went bust in April. Could AT&T's $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner go the same direction?Investors will ""be looking for a better understanding of what exactly was the decisive factor that shifted management thinking toward continuing to operate Pfizer as a single company and what could change in the future to make the idea of a split attractive again,"" he wrote in a research note.Pfizer will also likely focus on Ibrance, its drug to battle ER-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer. The drug was granted accelerated approval in early 2015.Scotti expects Pfizer to comment on growing competition with Eli Lilly's (LLY) abemaciclib and Novartis' (NVS) ribociclib. Eli Lilly's drug has demonstrated positive results as a monotherapy -- a single drug to battle that disease -- but Novartis' had some safety concerns earlier this year.Wall Street is also likely to zero in on Pfizer commentary circling Prevnar, its pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Prevnar added $6.2 billion in worldwide sales to Pfizer's top line in 2015, but its sales missed forecasts in Q2.""Previously, Pfizer commented they expect fiscal 2016 sales to be 'comparable to slightly below' 2015 levels, and do not expect Prevnar to be a growth driver in 2017 or 2018,"" Scotti wrote.Investors will likely have a keen eye on Pfizer's long-term growth expectations.In the stock market today, Pfizer stock fell 0.69% to 31.71, touching a six-month low. Pfizer stock has traded below its 50-day moving average, a key support line, for nearly three months.RELATED:Amgen, Gilead, Eli Lilly Eat Into AbbVie's Humira Sales: AnalystAriad Could Follow Gilead's — Or Mylan's — Route In Drug Price Battle

418,PFE,"Eli Lilly (LLY), Pfizer (PFE) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) are chipping away at AbbVie's (ABBV) Humira sales, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said Monday after AbbVie missed Q3 expectations Friday, primarily on declining Humira sales.Divan downgraded AbbVie stock to neutral and cut his price target to 60 from 70. He models immunosuppressant Humira pulling in $18.1 billion in 2018 sales, declining to $11.3 billion and $5.2 billion in 2022 and 2025, respectively.Humira accounted for 63% of AbbVie sales in Q3. The drug is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and irritable bowel disorder — markets where branded rivals are already on the market and biosimilars are pressuring AbbVie's patent on Humira.AbbVie is working to protect that patent, but Divan expects Amgen (AMGN) and others to have biosimilars on the market by 2022.""Whether it is in 2020, 2021, 2022 or some other year, at some point Humira will start to decline,"" Divan wrote in his research report. To cope with Humira's decline (it missed Q3 expectations by $100 million), AbbVie has eight late-stage drugs capable of bringing in $25 billion to $30 billion in combined sales.IBD'S TAKE: AbbVie's earnings have grown an average 20% over the past five quarters, but have also declined for the last three periods. Get the full scoop in IBD's Income Investor.Pfizer, Eli Lilly/Incyte (INCY) and Gilead are all working on a class of drugs called JAK inhibitors that could compete in arthritis.Celgene (CELG), Novartis (NVS) and Eli Lilly have IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors for psoriasis, and all three expected to become blockbuster drugs within five years of their launches.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) already has a JAK inhibitor and is in the IL-23 field. AbbVie has its own IL-23 drug in development, but ""it will be entering into a crowded market where it will have more competitive and pricing challenges,"" said Divan.In the irritable bowel disorder market, Celgene's mongersen and ozanimod could put pressure on Humira sales as soon as 2020-22, Divan wrote.But UBS analyst Marc Goodman says the pressure on AbbVie stock is overdone. Shares touched a seven-month low Friday after AbbVie reported its Q3 earnings, which fell 6.2%. In the stock market today, AbbVie stock fell 3.2% to 55.78.Goodman kept his buy rating and 73 price target on AbbVie stock, though the company's 2017 earnings guidance for 13%-15% growth in 2017 implied $4.43-$5.53, which was lower than Wall Street's $5.62 view.Still, Goodman wrote that ""based on management's commentary on Humira volume and pricing, we think the concerns appear overdone. The earnings for next year are a little light, but we think the investment in the pipeline should drive growth in the longer term.""RELATED:Eli Lilly, AbbVie Top 2017 Rankings; Pfizer, AstraZeneca Flailing

420,PFE,"Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIA) stock was feeling some Mylan Pharmaceutical (MYL)-like pressure Monday on Congress' looming deadline to submit information regarding an $80,000 price increase for a rare cancer drug.Over the past year, Ariad upped its price on Inclusig to $199,000 annually from $120,000, RBC analyst Michael Yee wrote in a research report. Inclusig treats specific classes of chronic myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Though Ariad sells 15-milligram and 45-mg bottles, the lion's share of patients (about 40%) are on a 30-mg dose, Yee wrote. The latter has to buy two 15-mg bottles, thus paying double the price.Yee doesn't see much stemming from Congress' pressure. Recently, Mylan agreed to make a generic, less costly version of its EpiPen, a device to treat anaphylaxis during emergency allergic reactions, after hiking the device's cost to $500 from $57.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech earnings season is in full swing with Merck, Eli Lilly, Vertex and Edward Lifesciences slated for Tuesday. IBD recently looked at some biotech giants and whether they can top expectations.Medivation (MDVN), which is being acquired by Pfizer (PFE), felt some congressional heat earlier this year over the $129,000 price tag on its prostate cancer drug. It later got a letter from Sen. Bernie Sanders.Gilead Sciences (GILD) came under some hot water earlier this year when it hiked the price on six of its drugs. But congressional requests for information didn't result in much, Yee wrote.""It's reasonably likely the congressional inquiries will blow over in time,"" Yee said.Ariad has until Nov. 4 to deliver information on the price hike including R&D spending and sales distribution tactics. Ariad has argued Inclusig isn't like Mylan's EpiPen and others.Ariad had ""a 20-year history of financial losses and unprofitability, far higher R&D spend than revenues, and $1.3 billion in historical spending to internally discover, develop and commercialize Inclusig,"" Yee wrote. Orphan drugs tend to be more costly from an R&D standpoint.Yee kept his sector perform rating on Ariad stock. But JPMorgan downgraded shares to neutral from underweight. By the closing bell on the stock market today, Ariad fell 9.7% to 9.37, at a nearly three-month low. Ariad is off 31% so far this month.

422,PFE,"Small drugmaker Medivation (MDVN) continued to battle Sanofi's (SNY) hostile takeover bid Wednesday as the latter tried to replace its board, while big biotechs Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) were said to be thinking of joining the fray.Sanofi proposed eight candidates ""who are willing to fully and fairly evaluate all of Medivation’s strategic options,"" which it believes Medivation's current board did not do when it unanimously rejected Sanofi's unsolicited $9.3 billion bid on April 29. Medivation responded with a statement urging shareholders to reject the attempt, which it called ""a tactic for Sanofi to facilitate its substantially inadequate and opportunistically timed proposal to acquire Medivation.""While Sanofi is the only suitor that's gone public, anonymous sources have been telling the media that a variety of other companies are thinking of making a bid. On May 9, Medivation reportedly signed non-disclosures agreements with Pfizer (PFE) and Amgen (AMGN), implying that it is open to being bought by somebody other than Sanofi. On Wednesday Bloomberg said that Celgene and Gilead were talking to advisors about the idea, though they hadn't actually approached the company.Both Celgene and Gilead have been urged by investors and analysts to make a sizable acquisition -- especially Gilead, as its massive hepatitis C franchise is already eroding in the face of competition. Medivation's current $1 billion in 12-month sales wouldn't make that big of an impact on Gilead's $33 billion top line, but much of the interest comes from Medivation's future prospects: its prostate-cancer drug Xtandi is still ramping while the company studies its use in other diseases, and it also has a few earlier-stage drugs in the pipeline.Medivation stock, which has lately gone tight after a sharp run-up amid the buyout speculation, fell 0.7% to 61.48 on the stock market today. Sanofi climbed 1.8% to 40.94. Gilead edged up 0.8% to 86.51 and Celgene was up 1.4% to 105.11.

423,PFE,"Specialty-drug giant Allergan (AGN) reported a mixed first quarter, affirmed guidance and announced a massive share buyback Tuesday, lifting its battered stock.Allergan stock was already boosted 6% Monday after Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) said in its Q1 report that its buyout of Allergan's generics unit, Actavis, is on track to close next month after having been delayed by various regulatory issues. This would render moot the worries over generic-drug pricing that drove the stock to a two-year low on Friday, after it had already been hammered by the break-up of its merger with Pfizer (PFE).The stock was up another 5.5% in early trading on the stock market today as Allergan reported operating earnings of $3.04 a share, up 15% from the year-earlier quarter and beating analysts' consensus by 4 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Sales climbed 48% to $3.8 billion, about $150 million below Wall Street's average estimate.Allergan affirmed full-year revenue guidance of $17 billion vs. $15.1 billion last year. All the above numbers exclude Actavis.The company said it will use part of the roughly $40 billion in proceeds from the Teva deal to buy back stock. It plans to buy $4 billion to $5 billion over the next four to six months, and said if conditions allow it will consider extending the program up to as much as $10 billion.Allergan stock, once a resident of the IBD 50, still holds an excellent EPS Rank of 97 and actually declined less than the group as a whole during the drug-stock sell-off between August and February. But the high-profile dissolution of the Pfizer deal in early April pushed the stock down to single-digit Relative Strength Ratings, leading to a mediocre Composite Rating of 40.

Late Tuesday, the company said new-home closings surged 23.2% in March.Most IBD 50 stocks were higher, led by Acuity Brands (AYI), which bolted  more than 13% upward following a strong quarterly earnings report.

Pfizer gained 5%.Meanwhile, oil-field services giants Baker Hughes (BHI) and Halliburton (HAL) outperformed in the S&P 500, jumping 9% and 6%, respectively, after the Justice Department filed a lawsuit to halt their planned merger on concerns that the combined company would stifle competition in the sector.After the close, watch for earnings from retailers Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) and small-cap Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI).
"
426,PFE,"Big pharma Pfizer (PFE) contemplated splitting itself, while specialty drugmaker Allergan (AGN) campaigned to regain investor confidence Wednesday, after the two companies announced that their planned merger was off.Pfizer early Wednesday confirmed rumors that the companies had canceled their $160 billion merger, two days after the Treasury Department released new guidelines that would have removed most of the tax benefits of the deal for New York-based Pfizer. After its stock tanked Tuesday, Allergan's CEO went on a media blitz to promote his company's prospects as a stand-alone.On a conference call with analysts Wednesday morning, Allergan CEO Brenton Saunders maintained that Treasury's action against tax inversions will have no impact on the stand-alone Allergan, which redomiciled to Ireland through an inversion deal with Warner Chilcott three years ago. The company will retain its 14% corporate tax rate, he said, and it should also be free to deploy capital however it chooses.Saunders also said Allergan's $40 billion sale of its generic unit Actavis to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) is unaffected by the spiking of the Pfizer deal and is on track to close in June. The timeline for that buyout was delayed from its original Q1 closing date, as Teva works its way through a multi-country regulatory clearance process, but Saunders said the two companies are determined to get it done.""Teva is doing a lot of work,"" said Saunders. ""They've restructured their company; they have named their entire leadership through a few levels that include 200 Allergan executives moving to Teva. ... This is a great deal for Allergan, but also a great deal for Teva.""Allergan stock, down 15% Tuesday, rebounded 3.5% Wednesday, to 244.74. Teva stock rose 4% to 56.73.The closing of the Actavis sale should give Allergan a big wad of cash, so many of the analysts' questions on the call related to what it will do with the money. Several seemed to be rooting for share buybacks, given that Allergan stock is trading near a 52-week low in the wake of the Pfizer breakup.Saunders said all options are on the table, but he emphasized that Allergan's ""growth pharma"" model means that it's constantly on the hunt for growth assets. He said that Allergan's business-development team has stayed active since the Pfizer deal was announced, and if the right opportunity came along ""we could announce it tomorrow.""A couple of analysts raised the name of contact-lens giant Bausch & Lomb, with which Saunders has a personal history. He headed the company from 2010 until 2013, when it was sold to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX) for $8.7 billion. Given Valeant's recent spectacular crackup, many on Wall Street have speculated that B&L might again go on sale, with Allergan a suitable buyer not only because of Saunders, but also because of Allergan's large ophthalmology business.Saunders' response to this seemed to be a swipe at Valeant's infamously opaque financial reporting.""It sold for $8.7 billion three, four years ago, with a late-stage pipeline of 30-some programs, and a strong organic growth profile,"" he said. ""I can't tell that any of those things today are still true. Based on public information, it's impossible to tell that it's worth more than it sold for four years ago.""Pfizer, meanwhile, rose 5% to 32.93, hitting a four-month high, as investors looked toward another possible major catalyst for its stock. Back in 2013, the company reorganized so that it would be able to split its innovative drug-development business from its established products, and perhaps divide itself into more pieces if necessary. The company had originally planned to make a decision on that this year, but when the Allergan buyout was announced, the issue was pushed into next year. In Pfizer's press release announcing the end of the Allergan deal, however, it said the decision date is back to this year.That itself could bring some more M&A, writes Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum.""After a recent acquisition of Hospira, Pfizer probably has critical mass to transform its Global Established Products business unit to an independent company, but Innovative Products business units might benefit from additional assets acquired from outside,"" Schoenebaum wrote in an email to clients.The prospects of both companies going back on the hunt may have been what lifted drug stocks as a whole Wednesday, especially biotechs. Distressed big-cap biotech Biogen (BIIB), which has been subject to buyout speculation given that it's trading 35% off its high, rose 5.3% to 279.57. Smaller Anacor Pharmaceuticals (ANAC) rose 16% to 73.20, likely because its late-stage eczema drug is seen as a fit for Allergan's dermatology portfolio.

429,PFE,"In just the past year and a half, antitrust concerns have undone or jeopardized several merger deals, adding to doubts that AT&T (T) can consummate its $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner (TWX).AT&T agreed to pay $107.50 a share for Time Warner, but the media giant's stock fell 3.1% to 86.74 on the stock market today, well below the bid price and an indication investors are skeptical that the deal will go through. AT&T fell 1.7% to 36.68. Still, the companies see the deal closing in late 2017.The Obama administration has become more aggressive on mergers and acquisitions lately, either suing to block them or demanding conditions that were too onerous to accept. Donald Trump has said he would block an AT&T-Time Warner deal as president, while Hillary Clinton has voiced concerns.In February  2014, Comcast (CMCSA) agreed to buy Time Warner Cable for $45 billion, combining the top two cable and broadband providers. The Federal Communications Commission raised concerns, with consumer groups and Netflix (NFLX) also objecting. With regulators expected to block the deal outright, Comcast gave up in April 2015.Charter Communications (CHTR) moved in, agreeing in May 2015 to buy TWC. That deal closed in May 2016.In November 2015, Pfizer (PFE) reached a deal to buy Allergan (AGN) for $160 billion in a so-called tax inversion that would've allowed Pfizer to change its domicile to Ireland and slash its tax bill.The deal, which would've created the world's largest drugmaker, came at a time when politicians were already bashing tax inversions. The Treasury Department introduced a series of new rules that made inversions less attractive.In April, Pfizer walked away from the deal, citing the Treasury rules.RELATED:Forget Allergan: Pfizer Has Its Sights On This Cancer Drugmaker Allergan, Pfizer Strike Off Down Separate Paths After Merger Killed As crude prices were collapsing in November 2014, oilfield services provider Halliburton (HAL) agreed to buy rival Baker Hughes (BHI) in a deal that was worth $34.6 billion at the time. It also would've put the combined companies above Schlumberger (SLB), prompting regulators to warn of a duopoly.Halliburton scrambled to find buyers for assets it sought to shed to win regulatory approval. But the Justice Department reportedly pushed Halliburton to sell more than $7.5 billion in assets to a single buyer.Then in April, the DOJ filed a lawsuit to block the merger, and in May the companies called off the deal, which by then was worth about $28 billion.RELATED:Why Halliburton's Failed Buyout May Actually Hurt CompetitionHalliburton Eyes New Deals After Ending Baker Hughes Bid In February 2015, Staples (SPLS) agreed to buy Office Depot (ODP) for $6 billion as the retailers faced pressure from e-commerce rivals like Amazon (AMZN).It was their second attempt. An earlier one was blocked by the Federal Trade Commission in 1997, but Staples and Office Depot said this time was different because the industry landscape was completely different, citing Amazon and other competitors.The FTC disagreed and sued in December 2015. In May, a judge sided with the federal government.In September 2014, General Electric (GE) inked an agreement to sell its home appliance business to Electrolux (ELUXY) for $3.3 billion as the industrial conglomerate sought to shed noncore assets and focus on areas like aviation, power systems, and oil and gas.The DOJ sued in July 2015, saying the merger would hurt consumers. Before a judge could rule on the lawsuit, GE walked away in December. The next month, GE sold the unit to China's Haier for $5.4 billion.In December 2013, top food distributor Sysco (SYY) agreed to buy rival US Foods for $3.5 billion. In February 2015, the FTC sued, arguing that a merger of the No. 1 and No. 2 players in the market would result in higher prices for restaurants, hotels and other companies that buy food and related supplies.In June 2015, Sysco abandoned the deal after a judge ruled in favor of the FTC.In July 2015, Anthem (ANTM) said it would buy Cigna (CI) for $54 billion, creating the largest health insurer by membership. It came just three weeks after Aetna (AET) reached a deal to acquire Humana (HUM) for $37 billion. The consolidation efforts came as the health sector struggled to find savings and address higher-than-anticipated costs associated with ObamaCare mandates.In July, the DOJ filed lawsuits to block both deals, saying much of the U.S. health insurance market would be controlled by just three companies. But in August, the DOJ signaled it might be willing to reach a settlement with Anthem and Cigna to allow their merger.In October 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) said it plans to buy Rite Aid (RAD) for $17 billion, bringing together the No. 2 and No. 3 drugstore chains and leapfrogging No. 1 CVS Health (CVS).Walgreens has been looking for buyers who could help the company offload stores and pass regulatory muster. Management is also in talks with the FTC and appeared to be making progress this summer.But Kroger (KR) seems unwilling to buy hundreds of stores that Walgreens and Rite Aid are trying to divest. Kroger had been interested, but wanted to close the locations and reopen them in its grocery stores. The FTC wants to preserve the stand-alone drugstores, sources told the New York Post.

435,PFE,"Shares of rising biopharma player Medivation (MDVN) jumped to an 11-month high Monday on reports the company now is willing to sell itself.Citing an anonymous source, Reuters reported that Medivation had signed non-disclosure agreements with Pfizer (PFE) and Amgen (AMGN), both of which were previously rumored to be interested in buying the company, while Sanofi (SNY) went public with its uninvited $9.3 billion bid last month.

"
436,PFE,"Investors have lavished more love on iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility USA (USMV) than on any other equity ETF so far this year.USMV has seen $5.28 billion in net inflow in 2016, helping assets balloon 82% to $13 billion.Investors in its category sibling, PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV), are likely feeling deflated and perhaps even a bit miffed.SPLV has soaked in a relatively modest $1.8 billion during the same period. That's despite gaining 8.4% over the past year vs. 6.7% for USMV.Both are faring far better than SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), a proxy for the broad U.S. stock market that has tumbled 1.4% in the past year.So why is SPLV proving less popular, as reflected in its in inability to attract more new money?Partly because this exchange traded fund gets knocked by rivals for being little more than a utility fund, says Nick Kalivas, senior equity product strategist at PowerShares.As of the May 20 quarterly rebalance, its weighting in the utilities sector actually went up a further 7.2% to more than 20%. It gained 13 stocks, including utility firms American Water Works (AWK), Entergy (ETR) and Public Service Enterprise (PEG). It also dropped 13 stocks, including T. Rowe Price (TROW) and Pfizer (PFE).SPLV screens for the 100 least volatile stocks in the S&P 500 and gives a bigger weighting to stocks with lower volatility.USMV also offers exposure to U.S. stocks with potentially less risk than the broader market. However, it constrains sector weightings to within a 5% band relative to the parent MSCI USA index.That holds appeal for institutional investors whose mandates and compensations are tied to closely following the benchmarks, according to Kalivas.""Our customers are more nimble advisors"" who are more apt to drift away from the benchmarks, he said.SPLV has no maximum or minimum sector-weight requirements. And that is a good thing, Kalivas argues. For example, the utilities stake in SPLV has varied greatly over the years. It was as high as 32% in 2011, went down to less than 3% in 2015, and is now ""marching back up,"" Kalivas pointed out.Right now, SPLV has no exposure at all to the volatile energy sector.""If a sector comes under stress and has a lot of volatility, you can avoid it (entirely),"" Kalivas said. He cites the financial crisis of 2007-2008 and the earlier tech crisis as periods when SPLV's unconstrained methodology ""would have been a big help."" Neither SPLV nor USMV has a 10-year history.Critics point out that SPLV makes big sector bets in the utilities and consumer staples sectors. This ETF tends to get hit hard when sector or interest-rate risk comes into play.

440,PFE,"No. 2 drugmaker Pfizer (PFE) could become acquisitive post-breakup flop, but it will likely overpay for those M&A assets, said Jeffries analyst Jeffrey Holford as he downgraded Pfizer stock Thursday, citing a lack of catalysts.In the stock market today, Pfizer stock fell nearly 1% to 32.76, its third consecutive down day. Shares dipped out of a flat base that formed over nearly two months and are now 13% from a possible entry point at 37.49.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs toppled hard Wednesday on political angst. But on Thursday, players like Supernus Pharmaceuticals rebounded. You can find a day's big movers at IBD's Stocks On The Move.Holford downgraded Pfizer stock to a hold rating from buy, and cut his price target to 36 from 39 ""as the key drivers that originally drove our upgrade have played out or failed to materialize,"" he wrote in a research report.Ibrance, Pfizer's treatment for metastatic breast cancer, was granted accelerated FDA approval in early 2015. But the strong ramp it enjoyed in the U.S. has since petered out. Rivals could add some pressure in 2017, even as Pfizer prepares for its European launch.""We note recent prescription trends indicate that the U.S. opportunity is becoming saturated as patients are beginning to roll off treatment as rapidly as new ones are recruited,"" he wrote. ""The European launch should reinvigorate growth in 2017.""Similarly, Holford was previously bullish on Pfizer Prevnar-13, a drug to combat pneumococcal pneumonia. But much of the U.S. adult catch-up opportunity is now penetrated, he wrote.Pfizer's biggest potential catalyst is to engage in M&A, which Holford sees as likely over the next 12-18 months. Pfizer walked away from its $160 billion merger with Allergan (AGN) after tax rules changed in April. Last month, it scrapped a years' old plan to itself break up into two separate companies.M&A would help Pfizer drive a stronger growth profile, but it's risky, he wrote.""Whilst management may find attractive targets to acquire, we believe that the environment for M&A is very competitive right now and there is a high risk that Pfizer may overpay for assets,"" he wrote.RELATED:Prothena Slammed On Politics; Could Win Eli Lilly Or Pfizer PartnershipMerck Topples Bristol-Myers On Lung Cancer Drug WinRegeneron-Sanofi Could Beat Pfizer, Roche, AstraZeneca On Eczema

442,PFE,"The Treasury Department may have squelched drug giant Pfizer’s (PFE) bid to take over Ireland-based Allergan (AGN), but ETF investors needn't fear.The new federal rules don't ice over the broader merger market, says Sal Bruno, chief investment officer of IndexIQ, the firm behind the largest merger-focused ETF.The $160 billion Pfizer-Allergan merger deal was widely seen as another attempt by a large U.S. company to move its legal domicile overseas and avoid America's steep corporate tax rates. The new rules make these so-called corporate inversions more difficult and potentially less profitable.However, ""tax inversion deals make up a small percentage of the total merger market,"" Bruno said. Most merger deals focus on opportunities for synergies and growth, he added.The Pfizer-Allergan kibosh hurts the merger industry from an ""optics standpoint,"" according to Bruno. Tactics to dodge corporate taxes have come in for flak recently from President Barack Obama and presidential candidates on both sides of the political divide.IQ Merger Arbitrage (MNA) dumped 1.4% Tuesday following the news and extended losses on the stock market today.This exchange traded fund invests in global companies that are targets of publicly announced takeovers. It rebalances monthly and uses a liquidity-based weighting method.Allergan is a top five stock holding in this exchange traded fund, with a 7% portfolio weighting.MNA has coasted along with far less volatility than the benchmark S&P 500 in the past year. Its 2.8% gain in the first quarter came in a very volatile period for the equity market.That performance helped to cushion Tuesday's blow.MNA was still up 1.35% for the year through April 5. By comparison, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) has added 0.67%.The challenges for merger ETFs extend beyond the Pfizer-Allergan debacle.The Obama administration has taken a more aggressive stance on big mergers. It's suing to block the $35 billion merger of oil majors Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI). Staples’ (SPLS) bid for rival office supplier Office Depot (ODP) is also under scrutiny.Even more worrisome, deal activity is showing signs of cooling off after a record year for M&A in 2015.The U.S. recorded 1,007 deals cumulatively worth $241.5 billion in the first quarter, down 33% from 1,250 deals worth $361.3 billion in Q1 2015, according to intelligence service Mergermarket.Bruno believes the pace of M&A will remain brisk for the near future.Interest rates remain low, making it easier to borrow money to buy other companies. In a low-growth climate, acquisitions can add growth if a company can't generate growth on its own. And corporate balance sheets and cash flows are healthier than they have been in decades.""There's ample deal flow out there,"" Bruno said. ""We have a very positive outlook for merger-arbitrage as a whole.""Most challenging of all, perhaps, ETF investors continue to be wary of more niche products.MNA falls into the ""liquid alternative"" fund category: it aims to diversify a portfolio made up mostly of stocks and bonds. It's a category that hasn't grown tremendously in the ETF space, Bruno said.MNA debuted in 2009 and holds $127.7 million in assets. ProShares Merger (MRGR) launched in 2012 and holds $8.2 million.Despite the proliferation of thematic new products, plain-vanilla ETFs are dominant.""Investors will continue to focus most of their time and attention, as they well should, on very low-cost, broad, very well-diversified market exposures,"" Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar, said in a recent interview.However, Bruno expects liquid-alt ETFs to take off as people get more comfortable with their diversification benefits.""We will see growth going forward,"" he said.

443,PFE,"A new sheriff is en route, but that hasn't stopped the old sheriff from swinging his corporate billy club around town.The subject is company mergers and the instances in which the administration of President Barack Obama -- who promised to ""reinvigorate"" federal antitrust enforcement on the campaign trail back in 2008 -- is cracking down are piling up. This week, Obama's Justice Department sued to block the $35 billion merger of Baker Hughes (BHI) and Halliburton (HAL) over antitrust concerns.Also this week, Obama said the Treasury Department had taken further steps to curb tax inversions by which U.S. companies buy a foreign target and then re-domicile to avoid higher taxes. That scuttled a major acquisition on Wednesday as drugmakers Pfizer (PFE) and Allergan (AGN) called off their $150 billion deal.There also are several other instances in recent weeks and months when the administration has taken aim at big business. So, what gives? Is it a product of last year's robust M&A environment, which saw $4.3 trillion in global deals announced, or symptoms of a White House that critics have accused of being anti-business?""They’re definitely getting more aggressive,"" Max Jacobs, an analyst at London-based investment research house Edison, said of the administration. ""Historically, Obama has been a bit more on the liberal government intervention side of things.""Take the Pfizer-Allergan merger. The deal would have resulted in U.S.-based Pfizer relocating its headquarters to low-tax Ireland to benefit from that nation's 12% corporate tax rate. By doing so, it would have bypassed U.S. rates of 35%, the highest in the industrialized world.Terminating a deal that had been in the works for months, Pfizer now will pay Ireland-based Allergan a breakup fee of $150 million.""There is a political calculation here,"" said Dane Hamilton, editor at Mergermarket, speaking of tax-inversion deals. ""Obviously, the Obama administration would like to stop companies from moving overseas because they generate a lot of tax dollars.""Still, Obama's pending departure in January may not bring much relief. In terms of a friendlier face when it comes to M&A, there is a dearth of obvious presidential candidates at the moment.Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party's front-runner for president, wants to crack down on inversions, while fellow White House Democratic hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders has called the practice a ""tax-scam."" Meanwhile, Republican front-runner Donald Trump and party rival Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas propose lowering U.S. taxes to ward off inversions, but aren't coming out in support of them.Still, clamping down on tax inversions won't solve the corporate tax code's underlying problems, said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford University.""Our tax system very much put these incentives in place,"" she said. She added, though, that it's becoming more difficult to get inversion deals done.Tax inversions aren't the only target, though. The vigilant antitrust watchman that is the Obama administration has taken aim elsewhere.In addition to antitrust concerns over the Baker Hughes-Halliburton deal, which would combine the world's No. 2 and No. 3 oilfield-services firms, the Justice Department took Electrolux (ELUXY) to trial late last year, causing General Electric (GE) to back out of a $3.3 billion deal to sell its appliances unit. And the Federal Trade Commission has taken Office Depot (ODP) and Staples (SPLS) to trial to block the $6.3 billion deal between the two biggest office-supply chains.There's more. Last year, the administration quashed the $45 billion Comcast (CMCSA)-Time Warner Cable (TWC) merger, which would have combined the nation's two largest cable television companies. Yet in 2010, it approved Live Nation Entertainment’s (LYV) merger with Ticketmaster.Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute, which favors more aggressive antitrust law enforcement, said the size of some of the companies merging raises ""red flags for enforcers.""But deals are still being struck despite politicians' griping.Major health insurers Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) combined in a $37 billion deal, and Anthem (ANTM) agreed to buy Cigna (CI) last year for $48.4 billion. The world's two largest beer makers, Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) and SABMiller, agreed to combine for $105 billion.For now, though, the old sheriff has a free hand, said Edison's Jacobs.""(Obama) has the benefit of not having to stand for election,"" he said.

444,PFE,"Stocks turned decidedly higher at midday Wednesday ahead of minutes due later today from the Federal Reserve's recent March meeting on interest rates.The Nasdaq was up 0.9%, the S&P 500 climbed 0.6% and the Dow Jones industrial average was up 0.4%. Volume was running lower in the stock market today compared to Tuesday's levels, but only mildly so on the Nasdaq.Drugmakers and oil stocks were among the biggest gainers at midday, while transportation stocks lagged.Pfizer (PFE) and Allergan (AGN) both rose after the drugmakers abandoned a $160 billion deal that would have shifted Pfizer’s headquarters to Ireland and provided the company an overseas tax shelter. Allergan rose more than 3% after plunging 15% on Tuesday after the Treasury Department unveiled rules aimed at discouraging such tax-inversion deals. Pfizer also rose more than 3%.Meanwhile, oil-field services giants Baker Hughes (BHI) and Halliburton (HAL) led the S&P 500, jumping 6% and 5%, respectively, after the Justice Department filed a lawsuit to halt their planned merger on concerns that the combined company would stifle competition in the sector.Most IBD 50 stocks were higher, led by building products stock Acuity Brands (AYI), which bolted 11% following a strong quarterly earnings report. The stock rocketed past an alternate entry at 242 after hesitating around an earlier 225.28 entry of a cup-with-handle base.Investors will scour minutes from the Federal Reserve's March 16 meeting, due at 2 p.m. ET, for clues about the central bank's outlook for interest rates.
"
445,PFE,"Stocks crept higher from a flat start Wednesday, enough to lift the Nasdaq narrowly back above its 200-day moving average.The Nasdaq rose 0.7%, the S&P 500 added 0.5%, and the Dow industrials tacked on a 0.3% gain in the stock market today.Volume was quiet, down 12% on the NYSE and 5% lower on the Nasdaq, relative to action at the same time Tuesday.Pfizer (PFE) ran at the head of the Dow, up more than 3% after breaking off its $160 billion takeover of Allergan (AGN). Nixing the Pfizer-Allergan inversion will reportedly cost Pfizer a breakup fee of $150 million, but it avoids running afoul of the U.S. Treasury Department, which launched anti-inversion regulations on Monday. Allergan stock also rose more than 3%.""Uninverted"" drug and medical plays led the Nasdaq 100: Celgene (CELG) , Illmina (ILMN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) jumped 4% or more each.IBD 50 stock Acuity Brands (AYI) padded its early gains, pressing 11% higher after a big fiscal Q2 sales and earnings win. The gain put shares 11% past a cup-with-handle buy point of 222.95.Baker Hughes (BHI) spiked 6%, and Halliburton (HAL) popped 5%, after the Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit challenging the  planned $35 billion acquisition of Baker-Hughes by Halliburton. The suit claimed the merger would eliminate competition in 23 specific products and services related to oil and gas field production.
"
446,PFE,"Pfizer (PFE) and Allergan (AGN) confirmed Wednesday that they are ending their $160 billion merger agreement after the U.S. Treasury unveiled new rules to curb tax inversion deals Monday.Ireland-based Allergan rose 3.5% to 244.74 on the stock market today. CEO Brenton Saunders told CNBC that Allergan has a bright future as a standalone firm. Allergan plunged 14.8% Tuesday to 236.55, hitting the lowest levels since late 2014, amid concerns that the new rules imperiled the deal.Pfizer rose 5% Wednesday after gaining 2.1% to 31.36 on Tuesday.""Pfizer Inc. today announced that the merger agreement between Pfizer and Allergan plc has been terminated by mutual agreement of the companies,"" the drug giant said in a statement. ""The decision was driven by the actions announced by the U.S. Department of Treasury on April 4, 2016, which the companies concluded qualified as an ""Adverse Tax Law Change"" under the merger agreement.""U.S. companies have a strong incentive to redomicile overseas to reduce their exposure to America's unusually high corporate tax rates and global reach. Pfizer's board reported voted to scrap the deal given that there would no longer be tax benefits.Saunders said the new rules blindsided Allergan, and felt that they unfairly targeted his compnay, though it was not named specifically. The Treasury set restrictions on""serial inverters"" -- and Allergan has a history of inversion deals. Allergan is run from New Jersey, but has its official headquarters in Dublin.Pfizer will pay $150 million in merger-related expenses.Pfizer CEO Ian Reed said in a statement the drug giant may go ahead with a corporate split: ""We plan to make a decision about whether to pursue a potential separation of our innovative and established businesses by no later than the end of 2016""The Obama administration has become more aggressive going after big mergers. The Justice Department is suing to block the merger of Halliburton (HAL)-Baker Hughes (BHI), which said they'll fight the DOJ's action.  But Baker Hughes shares rebounded 8.8% Wednesday after sliding 5.1% on Tuesday on reports that the DOJ would take action. Halliburton popped 5.9% intraday  after climbing 0.2% Tuesday.Meanwhile, the FTC is in the midst of a court battle seeking to block Staples (SPLS) from buying office supplies rival Office Depot (ODP).
"
447,PFE,"Biotech stocks fell into one of the deepest craters in their history, starting last summer, but rumblings of a recovery are sounding.After a three-year bull run that more than quadrupled its value by its peak last July, IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech Industry Group plunged 50% by early February, hurt by backlashes against high drug prices and mergers that seek to lower corporate taxes.But the group has gained 12% since its Feb. 11 low, and some leading stocks have done better than that.3 Biotech Stocks Buoyed By Potential Blockbuster DrugsBioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) is up 30% from its Feb. 9 low. Incyte (INCY) has gained 29% from its low point that same week, while Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) has climbed 45%, and Medivation (MDVN), boosted by buyout talk, is up 127%.The group was up by even more before taking some hits over the past two weeks on negative earnings news from several industry players. But fund managers tell IBD the rebound is here.Why? For one, they say, the spate of bad news has already been factored into stock prices. But more than that, they see a climate favoring rejuvenated M&A, hot drugs in the new-product pipeline and pricing power for innovate products.Bottom line: The positive factors that drove the runup never went away, they say. They just got drowned out by the noise.""A very key point is that this group is a very high-beta group -- particularly the small- to midcap stocks. Since they don't have sales, they don't have earnings,"" said Tom Vandeventer, portfolio manager at Tocqueville Asset Management.""The history of this group is that elevated macro uncertainty definitely hits (it),"" Vandeventer said. ""My own opinion is this group trades more on sentiment than on fundamentals during those time periods.""Vandeventer points to troubles in China as emblematic of the macroeconomic concerns that hit biotech stocks.Another sentiment-driving factor is politics.Many of the candidates in the U.S. presidential race have bashed drugmakers for high prices and have proposed ways to clamp down. Wall Street has dismissed some of these ideas as impossible or ineffective. What seems to be generating the most concern are Democrats' proposals to let Medicare and Medicaid negotiate drug prices, which they are not allowed to do now.Already the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services has shown its teeth. It announced a pilot program changing the reimbursement for Medicare Part B, which covers drugs administered in hospitals and clinics. The Part B reimbursement scheme was long criticized for encouraging use of expensive drugs because it reimburses health care providers for the entire cost of a drug, plus 6% on top. The proposed scheme would reduce that premium and add a flat fee unrelated to the price of the drug. That, in theory, could encourage doctors to choose cheaper options.On the M&A front, the Treasury Department last month issued new guidelines on tax-inversion deals that derailed what would have been the drug industry's biggest-ever merger, between Pfizer (PFE) and Allergan (AGN). Tax inversions have become a popular way for drugmakers to boost their bottom lines and get access to cash. Allergan, after earlier mergers, is based in Ireland, which has low taxes.""We think that with the tax regulation -- I call this the 'inversion bottom' -- and the bad press associated with the health care industry, that created a bottom in our minds,"" said Robert Bombace, senior portfolio manager at Frost Investment Advisors. ""A lot of the bad news has already been baked into these companies.""In fact, a number of industry insiders say the breakup of the Pfizer-Allergan merger could turn out to be good for biotech stocks because it makes them acquisition targets for the two companies. Allergan has a long history of acquisitiveness, and Pfizer is thinking of splitting its innovative drug business from its other products. Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum says Pfizer will want to bulk up its innovative business to make it valuable as a standalone, since its pipeline is modest compared to its big-pharma competitors.Schoenebaum has also said, though, that biotech boards are balking at buyout offers. They can't accept how much their valuations have dropped, so they've been unwilling to sell at market prices. He suspects this will lead to hostile takeover deals if the big players are willing to do them. This partly came to fruition in late April, when Sanofi (SNY) made an unsolicited $9.3 billion bid for Medivation, as rumors swirled that AstraZeneca (AZN) and Pfizer were also interested.Medivation's response reflected the attitude that Schoenebaum spoke of -- that the market was underpricing the stock.""Sanofi's opportunistically timed proposal, which comes during a period of significant market dislocation, and before several important near-term events for the company, is designed to seize for Sanofi value that rightly belongs to our stockholders,"" Medivation founder and CEO David Hung said in a statement rejecting the offer.Bombace, however, says the biotechs' reluctance might be for show.""I think that's just a bargaining chip,"" he said. ""The reality is that most of these companies will have to partner up anyway. ... The larger pharma and biotech names ... will reach a point where their pipelines are so dry, it will force their hands.""Bombace sees lots of exciting biotechnology science going on to fill out those pipelines. As he put it, we're ""going from the Model T stage to the space-shuttle stage.""Though he declined to name specific companies, he pointed to work in biomarkers -- which include PD-1 inhibitors such as Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Opdivo and Merck's (MRK) Keytruda. He also cited work in genetic mutations, the focus of many rare-disease firms such as BioMarin and Bluebird Bio (BLUE).These discoveries are keeping money flowing into and out of biotechnology, says Leonard Yaffe, who manages a health care hedge fund at Kessef Capital Management. He told IBD that specialty drugs -- the largely biologic drugs prescribed by specialists, as opposed to primary-care doctors -- contributed only 1% of prescriptions last year but 37% of dollars spent on drugs, up from 25% two years earlier.""One thing I think will drive the biotech stocks is that, if you look at drugs introduced in the last two years, 65% of the revenue derived from those drugs are from biologicals,"" Yaffe said. ""So it's the most attractive sector in the pharmaceutical area.""Also, while most publicly traded biotech stocks don't have earnings, those that have successfully launched drugs remain highly profitable. Of the top five biotechs in market cap -- Gilead Sciences (GILD), Amgen (AMGN), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB), and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) -- four have IBD EPS Ranks ranging from 89 to 96, putting them in the top 11% of all stocks in EPS growth. Regeneron has a 68 EPS Rank.Those numbers, however, reflect the pricing power of biologic drugs, which is precisely what's under political attack these days. Vandeventer says price uncertainty is the biggest risk to his bull thesis on the group right now. But he also points out that Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton attempted a previous overhaul of the health care system back in the mid-1990s, which depressed drug stocks in the short term but was followed by the late-1990s boom.That boom was driven by the first wave of biotech innovation, when companies like Amgen and Roche's (RHHBY) Genentech proved that biotechnology could produce blockbusters. Vandeventer says that innovation will remain the key in maintaining pricing power, even under political pressure. He points to Gilead's portfolio of hepatitis C drugs, which started in late 2013 with the launch of Sovaldi. Despite much political criticism of Sovaldi's high price, no one could stop it because the drug was so superior to anything else on the market.""Companies that have done the research -- they'll continue to get price increases,"" he said. ""Companies that are particularly in the rare-disease, orphan-disease arena, (or) the oncology space -- companies that have drugs in an era of targeted medicine that have higher efficacy rather than a shotgun trying to hit a disease -- are going to have pricing power.""The promise of such drugs can still make small stocks explode. Celator Pharmaceuticals (CPXX) has surged to over 13 from under 3 since March on favorable late-stage trial results for its acute myeloid leukemia treatment. The company also saw a hedge fund take a position in the stock and attracted favorable initial coverage from an analyst.There are signs that even generalist investors think biotech stocks have gotten cheap, says Yaffe. During the first quarter, a common lament was that every biotech stock got punished for bad news, but good news got no reward. But when Biogen issued a mixed earnings report that drew mostly negative reactions from Wall Street on April 21, its stock rose more than 5%.Biogen had fallen even harder than other big-cap biotechs, dropping 50% from its March 2015 high to its Feb. 12 low, so it was ready for a bounce, says Yaffe.""The overview comment is the sector had corrected 30%, and at some point it gets to the level where the stocks are very attractive,"" he said.
"
448,PFE,"Less than a month after Pfizer (PFE) scrapped its $160 billion takeover of Allergan (AGN) over new anti-inversion rules, the drug giant reportedly is eyeing a possible bid for  Medivation (MDVN), sending the cancer biotech's stock higher.Pfizer has approached Medivation for talks, according to Reuters. That could lead to an offer that would top a $9.3 billion bid for Medivation from France's Sanofi (SNY) last week. Medivation has rejected Sanofi's $52.50-share bid as undervaluing the company, which is best known for prostate cancer drug Xtandi.Medivation shares have been trading well above that Sanofi offer price, closing down 0.8% to 57.52 on Tuesday. Medivation rose above 60 in pre-market trading on the stock market today on the Reuters report.Pfizer stock edged lower before the open. On Tuesday, Pfizer rose 2.7% to 33.70, breaking out of a consolidation, after the pharmaceutical king reported its best quarterly earnings per share gain in more than six years. Pfizer's 32% EPS rise, better than expected, benefited from several one-time factors, including its recent Hospira takeover.
"
449,PFE,"Stocks quickly trimmed early losses roughly an hour into Wednesday's session as a raft of data on the U.S. economy inspired some buying. Meanwhile, mid-cap biotech Medivation (MDVN) continued to rally amid speculation that it's still an acquisition target.The Nasdaq composite fell 0.5%, and the S&P 500 slipped 0.4%, after being down as much as 0.7% shortly after the open. The Dow Jones industrials eased 0.2%. The small-cap S&P 600 turned higher after the initial sell-off, but it later retreated again and is down 0.4%.The market began to turn higher on news that the ISM services sector survey for April came in at 55.7, above the Econoday consensus forecast of 54.7. A figure above 50 indicates expanding activity. U.S. factory orders in March, meanwhile, rose 1.1%, well above the 0.6% growth forecast, while the Markit PMI services index also beat expectations (52.8 vs. 52.0).The Dow utilities also bucked the market's decline, adding 0.5% to a roughly 0.9% advance over the prior two sessions. Volume is running mildly lower on both sides vs. the same time on Tuesday.Among leading new companies, regional homebuilder LGI Homes (LGIH) cooled off with a 1% loss to 27.49. The Texas-based small cap has been building a base of its own after it went on a big spurt in the second half of 2015. Its Aug. 5, 2015, breakout past a 20.20 entry yielded a nearly 79% rally over 17 weeks before the stock began to correct off its 36.07 high.LGI, which focuses on young families seeking to exit the apartment world, is now 23% below that peak. In normal circumstances, a high-quality stock will rally to within 5% to 15% below its 52-week or all-time peak, form a handle, then bust out of that base. However, the probabilities of such success are diminished amid the pressured uptrend. On the Nasdaq itself, there have been six distribution days, or bouts of heavy institutional selling, over the past 11 sessions alone.On the upside, Medivation rose 2% to 58.69 in volume running more than triple its normal pace. Medivation's average daily volume of 3.95 million shares means that on an hourly basis, 610,000 of its shares are traded on average. As of 10:25 a.m. ET, Medivation's turnover had already hit 1.8 million shares.The San Francisco-based company strives to produce brand-new medicines by developing four to six product candidates that, upon acquisition, have the potential to go into clinical development within 12 to 18 months. Reports that Pfizer (PFE), which issued solid results on Tuesday and gapped up as a result, may be looking to acquire Medivation have been acting like a strong tailwind for the stock. Pfizer is up marginally but is showing good action after Tuesday's breakout past a 33.60 entry point.Medivation's fourth-quarter profit surged 164% to 29 cents a share on a 37% revenue boost to $378 million. Wall Street sees Q1 profit up 130% to 23 cents a share, which would mark an eighth straight quarter of excellent earnings. On March 31, Medivation shares rocketed above its 200-day moving average, taking a large step in the process of forming a positive base pattern. Now, it's been working on the right side of a giant cup for the past three months. The stock is currently 17% below an all-time high of 70.79.Medivation scores a 98 Composite Rating out of a maximum 99 by IBD Stock Checkup, which means that its combination of fundamentals, stock price action and institutional fund sponsorship is superior to 98% of all companies in IBD's vast database.

450,PFE,"Big pharma Pfizer (PFE) rose Tuesday after it beat Wall Street's Q1 estimates and raised its guidance, as the company moved on after it and Allergan (AGN) last month called off their mammoth $160 billion merger.Before the open, Pfizer said earnings, excluding one-time items, rose 32% over the year-earlier quarter to 67 cents a share, beating analysts' consensus by 12 cents. Revenue increased 20% to $13 billion, beating consensus by about $1 billion.The accounting in Q1 was complicated by several factors, including the Sept. 3 acquisition of generic drugmaker Hospira.""If we look closely to year-over-year revenue growth, it is worth mentioning that out of $2.1 billion growth vs. Q1 ’15 (or $2.9 billion of operational growth or 26% year-over-year) favorable FX (foreign-exchange rates) contributed $729 million, and inclusion of Hospira contributed $1.2 billion,"" wrote Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum in an email to clients. ""Excluding FX and Hospira, Pfizer stand-alone revenue increased by $1.7 billion (15% year-over-year growth).""There is also an additional factor favorably contributing to revenues -- $900 million due to an additional five selling days this quarter. Excluding this impact, operational year-over-year revenue growth comes as 8%, which is still very good growth for Pfizer with its relatively mature portfolio of products.""Still, none of these factors except foreign exchange contributed to Pfizer's full-year guidance increase. The company added $2 billion to its revenue guidance, now $51 billion to $53 billion, and 18 cents to its EPS range, now $2.38 to $2.48. Pfizer said that about $1 billion of the revenue hike and 12 cents of the EPS gain were due to improved operating performance.Pfizer stock rose 2.7% on the stock market today, to 33.70, and touched a nearly five-month high.A number of important drugs also beat consensus, including breast-cancer treatment Ibrance, epilepsy drug Lyrica, and pneumococcal vaccine Prevnar 13. Enbrel -- Amgen's (AMGN) rheumatoid-arthritis drug, which Pfizer markets outside the U.S. -- also beat expectations, as it did domestically for Amgen in its Q1 report last week.Nonetheless, investors' minds may be elsewhere, wrote Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan in a research note.""We expect investors to view the quarter as a positive but maintain their focus on the strategic outlook of the company following the failed Allergan deal and ahead of a decision on a potential split of Pfizer,"" he wrote.Pfizer and Allergan, based in low-tax Ireland, called off their merger, which would have been the industry's largest ever, after the U.S. Treasury unveiled new rules to curb tax inversion deals.
"
451,PFE,"Eli Lilly (LLY) and AbbVie (ABBV) topped a Credit Suisse evaluation of pharmaceutical companies heading into 2017, leaving more challenged Pfizer (PFE), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) in the dust.But the PharmaValues 2017 list did little for IBD's 44-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group, which fell a fraction on the stock market today, a fifth consecutive down day. The group is down more than 20% this year, touched a three-month low Monday and is trading below its 50-day moving average.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech and pharmaceutical stocks have been trampled in the last month. With Q3 earnings reports coming up, can they climb the ""wall of worry?""Credit Suisse ranked 48 Big Pharma stocks on factors like enterprise value/net present value, pricing and replacement powers, and sales growth. Overall, Eli Lilly topped the list, with Europe-based Sanofi (SNY) and Novartis (NVS) trailing closely.AbbVie ranked highest on fundamentals, with investors likely assuming a long life span for Humira, Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a research report. Humira is the brand name for adalimumab, Abbvie's drug to treat arthritis, plaque psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.AbbVie stock, though, slipped a small fraction Monday, while Lilly stock fell nearly 1%.Meanwhile, Pfizer was ""weak across the board,"" AstraZeneca has a high EV/NPV (enterprise value to net present value) and Novo Nordisk is exposed to U.S. pricing pressure.For AstraZeneca, investors are potentially factoring in its oncology pipeline, Credit Suisse says, but ""recent results from others demonstrate significant risk.""Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) scored well in EV/NPV valuation, with most of its sales power driven by its generic division. Gilead Sciences (GILD), Incyte (INCY) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are all trading at a discount with Vertex only needing ""minimal further pipeline success to justify the current valuation,"" the report said.Among biotechs, Vertex topped Credit Suisse's list, with Amgen (AMGN) flailing at the bottom. Like pharmaceuticals, IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group, has been down this month. The group fell a fraction Monday and, like the ethical drugs group, also fell for a fifth straight trading day, and fell for the seventh day of the past eight trading days.Though near the bottom overall, AstraZeneca scored well in terms of pricing power with its shift toward oncology products. But Novo Nordisk is in ""the eye"" of the diabetes-rebate storm in the U.S., Credit Suisse said.Pricing power, Credit Suisse analysts note, is important as it helps ""companies to resist discount pressures from formulary managers and governments."" In that regard, Allergan (AGN) is the clear winner, with only Shire (SHPG) rivaling it in the dry-eye market.Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), which focuses on rare diseases, is the most exceptional biotech, the analysts said, while Biomarin (BMRN), Incyte and Vertex also get high marks for being unique.Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Eli Lilly beat out the cohort on R&D productivity and ability to drive the current pipeline.This follows the dramatic seesaw between Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck (MRK) after Bristol-Myers' lung cancer drug, Opdivo, failed to meet a key endpoint. Eli Lilly scored well on its launches of Trulicity for diabetes and Taltz for psoriasis.
"
452,PFE,"Prothena's (PRTA) 10% stock nose-dive since Friday amid political volatility is a buying opportunity, says RBC analyst Michael Yee, who sees the biotech landing a partnership with the likes of Eli Lilly (LLY) or Pfizer (PFE) on its psoriasis drug.Investors, though, haven't been that bullish on Prothena stock or any of its rivals. On Wednesday, IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group was the worst performing out of 197 groups tracked. Shares plunged 3.1%, dipping below the 50-day moving average.IBD'S TAKE: The 421-company group is ranked No. 8 out of 197 groups tracked, rising from No. 126 just 13 weeks ago. But shares were raked over the coals Wednesday as Prothena and Supernus toppled markedly. Check out IBD's Industry Themes to get an idea of better stock bets.Yee chalks the weak drug stocks of late to political angst. He has an outperform rating and 95 price target on Prothena stock. Prothena shares closed up 0.9% on the stock market today to 54.85, but intraday had fallen more than 9% below an entry point at 60.09 touched on Sept. 19, out of a consolidation. Investors are advised to sell if a stock falls 7% or 8% from a buy point.""The key take-away is the recent 10% pullback, which we think is mostly all due to political uncertainties (House/Senate race), is an opportunity in our view because the company is on track with a very busy and full pipeline,"" he wrote in a research report Thursday.Prothena has three key drugs on the line. It is currently enrolling patients in Phase 2b and Phase 3 trials for NEOD001, a drug to treat amyloidosis. Amyloidosis occurs when a normally soluble protein mis-folds and accumulates, becoming toxic to organs.Yee has 70% confidence in NEOD001's chances and sees ""100% potential upside"" toward a 125 price target if the Phase 2B Pronto trial shows positive data in 2017. And Prothena's PRX002 and PRX003 are underappreciated by the Wall Street consensus, Yee says.He expects the duo to provide additional upside opportunities in 2017-2019. PRX002 aims to treat Parkinson's in partnership with Roche (RHHBY), and PRX003 is Prothena's drug for psoriasis. The latter is key considering Big Pharma's interest in inflammation drugs, evidenced by a number of Allergan (AGN) deals.""Pharma is interested in this including Pfizer and Eli Lilly,"" he wrote. ""We think Prothena could land a nice partnership on this asset after Phase II data in summer.""The design could also be novel, he says. Prothena's PRX003 is building on the science of inhibiting TH-17 cells and IL-17s cytokines, which are tied to inflammatory diseases. The method is used by Amgen (AMGN), Eli Lilly and Novartis (NVS) in their psoriasis drugs.RELATED:Allergan Challenges Intercept With NASH DrugEli Lilly Looks To Coral More Animal-Health Business From Zoetis

453,PFE,"Apple (AAPL) received another price target increase Thursday, top-rated stocks Gigamon (GIMO) and GrubHub (GRUB) were upgraded to buys, and Big Pharma stocks Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE) got divergent ratings from Wall Street analysts on Thursday.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves reiterated his overweight rating on Apple stock and raised his price target to 129 from 121 as sentiment around the iPhone maker turns positive ahead of its September-quarter earnings report.""We believe current iPhone expectations are reasonable and see the potential for upside to Street profit expectations over the next year from strong app store sales, among other things,"" Hargreaves said in a report.Apple is scheduled to report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Oct. 25.Apple's results could be boosted by an uptick in iPhone average selling prices, thanks to the popular high-end iPhone 7 Plus, and strong App Store downloads, including the hit mobile game ""Pokemon Go,"" Hargreaves said.""We recommend buying AAPL,"" Hargreaves said. ""We believe the combination of an attractive valuation, improving iPhone growth rates, and optimism around the iPhone 8 cycle create a favorable risk/reward around AAPL.""Apple stock fell 0.3% to 116.98 on the stock market today, snapping a seven-session winning streak.Bank of America upgraded shares of Gigamon and GrubHub to buy. It gave Gigamon a price target of 61 and GrubHub a PT of 46.Shares of Gigamon, a computer network equipment firm, edged up 0.3% to 49.93.GrubHub, an online and mobile platform for restaurant pickup and delivery orders in the U.S., rallied 2.1% to 41.18.Both stocks are on the IBD 50 list of top-performing companies. Gigamon is ranked No. 2 on the IBD 50, while GrubHub is No. 5.Bank of America upgraded pharmaceutical giant Merck to buy and set a price target of 70. Merck was up 1.4% at 62.51.Investment bank Jefferies downgraded drugmaker Pfizer to hold. Pfizer shares were down 0.9% at 32.76.
"
454,PFE,"Financial markets are beginning to believe the Federal Reserve.That's the simplest explanation for the tumble that major stock indexes took on Tuesday, which saw the 10-year Treasury yield rise to a four-month high and the U.S. dollar index hit its highest level in seven months.While the U.S. central bank's key overnight lending rate is barely above zero and policymakers have repeatedly reined in their intentions for further hikes, markets have taken each Fed pronouncement with a grain of salt. Whether investors doubted the Fed's resolve or its economic forecast, markets have been pricing in an even lower-rate future than the Fed has telegraphed. No longer — at least not to a significant extent.When the Fed's rate committee last met on Sept. 21, members' projections pointed to a hike in December and two rate hikes in 2017. Yet markets, while on board with the December hike, persisted in pricing in less than a 33% chance of a subsequent hike before the fourth quarter of 2017.But over the past seven trading sessions, which have seen the 10-year Treasury yield rise from 1.56% to 1.76%, investors have gotten with the Fed's program, so to speak. Now, markets are pricing in roughly a 46% chance of a rate hike in September 2017 (following an earlier hike this December), the CME Group's FedWatch tool shows.Here's why this is causing a simultaneous re-pricing of stocks in the short term:While the uptick in government bond yields might make stocks modestly less attractive on a relative basis, the bigger issue is likely the rise in the dollar against other major currencies as investors see the Fed tightening and other major central banks easing. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback vs. a basket of major currencies, jumped to 97.7 on Tuesday, the highest since March 10, from 96.9 on Monday.That's a negative for the earnings of U.S. multinationals which get a sizable share of their sales and earnings in foreign currencies, such as Pfizer (PFE), Boeing (BA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL).Further, while other countries may be helped by weaker currencies, including eurozone nations and the U.K., economists believe the overall effect of a stronger dollar dampens global growth. That's especially true of emerging markets, which have high levels of dollar-denominated debt that becomes harder to service as the dollar rises.The surprise, if there is one, is that the rise in Treasury yields has come after a September jobs report showed a smaller-than-expected 156,000 gain. The explanation is that Fed policymakers think the U.S. has already reached full employment and that the economy only needs to create perhaps 100,000 jobs a month to keep the jobless rate steady.IBD'S TAKE: How can you tell if a jobs report is too hot, too cold or just right? Markets may react negatively or positively on the day of the report, but the key for investors is to stay abreast of the market's prevailing trend. Visit IBD University for a primer on how to time the stock market and read The Big Picture column every day.The good news is that the markets have come most of the way in adjusting to the Fed's timetable. Yet, the Fed has been pretty unreliable in its predictions, so markets may still need to adjust — one way or another — if policymakers turn out to be too optimistic or pessimistic when it comes to growth, inflation and the job market.RELATED:Divided Fed Holds Off On Rate Hike, Sees Slower Tightening PathU.S. Added So-So 156,000 Jobs In September, Won't Change Fed Dollar Dive On Fed Boosts Outlook For Exports, Corporate Profits

"
458,PFE,"Drugmaker Medivation (MDVN) missed Wall Street's Q1 estimates and affirmed guidance late Thursday, as it fended off the increasingly hostile attentions of big pharma Sanofi (SNY).Medivation's revenue rose 41% over the year-earlier quarter to $182.5 million, missing analysts' consensus by $14 million, according to Thomson Reuters. Net income climbed 35% to 11 cents a share, badly missing consensus of 23 cents.Medivation nonetheless affirmed its full-year guidance, calling for $900 million to $970 million in revenue and $1.30 to $1.40 in EPS. Last year, it made $1.01 a share on $943 million in revenue.The company's revenue comes from royalties on its prostate-cancer drug Xtandi from Japan's Astellas, which markets the treatment. Medivation said that Xtandi brought in a total of $547 million in the quarter and should sell $1.425 billion to $1.525 billion in the full year.""Consistent with the first quarter of 2015, our first-quarter 2016 non-GAAP net income was impacted by several seasonal items, including the lower royalty rate on ex-U.S. Xtandi sales, the higher gross-to-net (i.e. rebating) accrual by Astellas on U.S. net sales, inventory drawdowns and the previously mentioned SG&A (sales, general & administrative) expenses related to our Astellas collaboration,"" Medivation said in its earnings release.Medivation stock was down a fraction in after-hours trading, following its earnings release. Shares had risen a fraction in Thursday's regular session to 59.22.Earlier Thursday, Medivation rejected a renewed $9.3 billion buyout offer from Sanofi, which Sanofi first made last week, and which Medivation rejected as undervalued.Sanofi CEO Olivier Brandicourt said in a letter to Medivation's directors that ""there is overwhelming support by your shareholders for a transaction.""He said he preferred to engage with Medivation's management rather than go hostile, but ""if you are not prepared to engage with us, we have no choice but to go directly to your shareholders. As you know, your shareholders have the ability to act at any time by written consent to remove and replace the board.""Medivation responded with a press release saying that there was nothing new in the letter and that the offer was still inadequate.Meanwhile, rumors continued to fly about other interested parties. AstraZeneca (AZN), Novartis (NVS) and Pfizer (PFE) had already been named by anonymous sources in previous weeks, but on Thursday Bloomberg reported that big biotech Amgen (AMGN) was also pondering a bid as it seeks a major acquisition to fill out its aging drug portfolio.Weeks of buyout speculation have driven the stock up more than 120% since its 30-month low, hit on Feb. 9, helping it to a strong IBD Composite Rating of 97 and the No. 50 spot on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks over the past 12 months.

459,PFE,"Stocks headed lower in early afternoon trading Wednesday, after an intraday glow from positive economic data faded.The Nasdaq was down 0.9%, while the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 each gave up 0.7%. Volume was tracking lower on the NYSE and Nasdaq vs. the same time Tuesday.Economic data were mixed. Hiring marked a three-year low, as private employers added 156,000 jobs in April, well below economists' projections. But the Institute for Supply Management's services sector index climbed 1.2 points in April to 55.7, above views for 54.7. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.Online travel bookers, gold and biotech stocks led the downside in today's stock market action. Utilities, Internet content and real estate investment trusts advanced. Priceline (PCLN) gapped down to sink 10% in speedy trade as it fell below its 200-day moving average. The stock is now 10% below a 1361.73 handle buy point it had been flirting with. Before the open, the online travel site delivered Q1 results that beat forecasts but offered disappointing Q2 earnings guidance.Among others in its travel booking industry group, TripAdvisor (TRIP) fell 4%, while Expedia (EXPE) and Ctrip.com (CTRP) each gave up 2%.Under Armour (UA) stumbled 7%, triggering the 8% sell rule as shares fell below a 45.53 buy point. Brean Capital downgraded the stock to hold from buy. The athletic apparel and shoe maker on Tuesday said its chief merchandising officer and chief digital officer will leave in July.On the IBD 50, Paycom Software (PAYC) and biotech Medivation (MDVN) rose 4% and 3%, respectively, in heavy volume. Pfizer (PFE) has approached Medivation about a possible takeover, according to reports late Tuesday.All eyes will be on Tesla Motors (TSLA) after the close of trade, when it's due to report its Q1 results. Analysts expect the electric car maker to post a loss of 58 cents a share vs. a 36-cent loss in Q1 2015. Revenue is forecast to rise 45% to $1.59 billion. Shares were down 2% in faster-than-usual trade, testing support at the 200-day line.
"
460,PFE,"The Federal Reserve hawks pushing for an immediate rate hike in September lost the battle, but they may have gained the upper hand over the doves, minutes of the September meeting suggested.With three members warning that the Fed risked losing its credibility or being forced to hike rates rapidly if the labor market got too tight, the group in the middle made a concession to the hawks — essentially pledging to hike rates in December unless there was a major shift in economic data.The Fed noted in its Sept. 21 statement that the case for a rate hike had strengthened, but policymakers had ""decided, for the time being, to wait for further evidence of continued progress"" toward full employment and 2% inflation.IBD'S TAKE: The rise in bond yields and recent stock headwinds suggest investors are taking Fed rate hike plans seriously. ""Some participants believed that it would be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate relatively soon if the labor market continued to improve and economic activity strengthened, while some others preferred to wait for more convincing evidence that inflation was moving toward the Committee's 2% objective.""The minutes explained that the doves resisted such a definitive statement clearly indicating that rates would rise in December, but the block in the middle shifted toward the hawks.Investors may have underestimated the influence of the growing camp of hawks. Fed members' own economic projections published after the meeting signaled a hike in December and two more in 2017. Markets initially ignored the Fed's timetable, pricing in an even slower pace of rate hikes, but played catch-up in recent days.Stocks closed narrowly mixed on the stock market today while Treasury yields nudged higher. On Tuesday stocks sold off sharply. The odds of a rate hike by the December meeting have risen to 70%.The 10-year Treasury yield has climbed to 1.78% from 1.56% over the past two weeks, while the U.S. dollar index has strengthened against other major currencies, rising to a seven-month high. The latter move, if sustained, would crimp the earnings of U.S. multinationals that get a sizable share of their sales and earnings in foreign currencies, such as Apple (AAPL), Pfizer (PFE), Boeing (BA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL).The bounce-back in Treasury yields has come after a September jobs report showed a smaller-than-expected 156,000 gain. The takeaway is that even slower job growth may not derail the Fed's timetable. That's because Fed policymakers think the U.S. has already reached full employment, or is very close, and that the economy only needs to create perhaps 100,000 jobs a month to keep the jobless rate steady.The minutes explain that three members ""cautioned that postponing policy firming for too long could push the unemployment rate markedly below its longer-run normal rate over the next few years.""

462,PFE,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration could approve a breakthrough adult eczema treatment from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) as soon as March 2017, the drugmakers said Monday, though shares plodded lower on a down day for the market overall.In a joint release, Regeneron and Sanofi said the FDA accepted for priority review the biologics license agreement (BLA) for Dupilumab, a treatment for mid-to-severe eczema. There's no cure for eczema, a rash, but it's typically treated with corticosteroids.IBD'S TAKE: Pfizer, too, is working on an eczema treatment via its acquisition of Anacor Pharmaceuticals. Early Monday, Pfizer said it had decided against splitting up, ending years of speculation.Dupilumab inhibits signaling of interleukin 4 and interleukin 13, the companies said. IL-4 and IL-13 are cytokines, proteins that signal cells and are tied to immune response. Clinical studies frequently link IL-4 and IL-13 to eczema and asthma.In 2014, Dupilumab was granted breakthrough drug designation. Now, it's on the path to receive a Prescription Drug User Fee Act target activation date on March 29, 2017. That would allow the FDA to collect fees from drugmakers to fund the approval process.The BLA for Dupilumab contains data from phase-three testing, which included more than 2,500 patients whose eczema wasn't controlled by topical treatments like cortisone cream. Regeneron and Sanofi evaluated Dupilumab as a singular treatment and in conjunction with corticosteroids.Pfizer (PFE), Roche (RHHBY) and AstraZeneca (AZN) are on Regeneron and Sanofi's heels with treatments for acute dermatitis as well. To that end, Pfizer acquired Anacor in June for $4.5 billion, giving it access to Anacor's nonsteroid gel to treat eczema, crisaborole.Despite the announcement, Regeneron stock was down 1.5% to 404.12 on the stock market today. A hot stock from mid-2009 until late 2015, Regeneron shares are down about 25% this year. Sanofi stock was down 0.8% to 38.04.RELATED:Regeneron-Sanofi Drug For Rheumatoid Arthritis Beats AbbVie's Humira

"
465,PFE,"Drugmaker Allergan (AGN) got a price-target cut from Canaccord Genuity Thursday after the company hit a delay in its merger with Pfizer (PFE), among other issues.Analyst Corey Davis noted that on Wednesday, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had asked for additional information on the Pfizer-Allergan merger, which was first announced in November. The companies also have to wait until Allergan finishes divesting its generic-drug business to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA), which itself hit a delay this month that caused Teva to push the expected closing date from Q1 to June. Pfizer and Allergan still expect to close their $160 billion merger in the second half of this year.""In the meanwhile, we are lowering our Q1 estimates (EPS drops from $3.43 to $2.89) as it's always the weakest quarter for specialty pharma, and we feel the rest of the Street is also too high,"" Davis wrote in his research note lowering his price target on Allergan stock to 320 from 340. ""This has been a trend in the past several years and is partly because of the reset of Medicare Part D.""Davis added that the merger of Target (TGT) and CVS Health (CVS) should hit Allergan's distribution business to the tune of $500 million a year, and the launch of bowel-disease drug Viberzi has increased spending.Davis wrote that he is nonetheless maintaining his buy rating due to the high likelihood that the deal will close. There has been some skepticism among investors over whether the Pfizer-Allergan deal is going to close this year -- besides the signals from Allergan's falling stock price, a buy-side survey by Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum this month found that a fifth of respondents place the odds at less than 50%. Along with the FTC's backlog, there's concern that the incoming president and Congress might do something to limit tax-inversion deals like this one, as some candidates have threatened to do.Pfizer's leadership and Wall Street analysts have been more confident, however. On March 8, Deutsche Bank analyst Gregg Gilbert wrote that the gap between Pfizer's offer price and Allergan's stock price -- then $47 -- presents a buying opportunity as it will likely narrow as the deal closing nears.Allergan stock was down a fraction in morning trading on the stock market today, near 274.

470,PFE,"Allergan (AGN) stock dived Tuesday after the U.S. Treasury and IRS announced plans for new rules aimed at curbing tax inversions, a practice that allows U.S. companies to avoid taxes by buying a foreign company and moving their headquarters overseas.That could impact the pending deal between Pfizer (PFE) and Ireland-based Allergan -- set to close this year -- since the latter is the result of several recent inversions.The companies said in a statement late Monday: ""We are conducting a review of the U.S. Department of Treasury’s actions announced today.

Under the new rules, there's a three-year limit on foreign companies ""bulking up"" on U.S. assets to avoid ownership requirements for a later inversion deal.This is the third set of inversion-curbing rules issued by Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew in the last few years. Lew said his office is continuing to explore additional ways to limit inversions.America's corporate tax system gives companies a strong incentive to shift headquarters overseas. The combined federal-state corporate rate is 39%, the highest in the industrialized world, while America -- unlike most nations -- taxes overseas earnings. Inverted companies still have to pay U.S. tax rates on American profits, but are get relief on earnings elsewhere.Other notable recent inversions involved Mylan (MYL), Medtronic (MDT) and Burger King, now called Restaurant Brands (QSR). But those deals have already closed.

The stock recovered to almost 4% above a 24.64 buy point after clearing a two-month cup base Friday.
"
475,PFE,"Disgraced drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) continued to sell off along with the rest of the medical sector Thursday as reports surfaced that creditors were demanding new terms as the company defaults on its massive debts.Reuters cited anonymous sources saying that in early talks, lenders were asking for higher interest payments and a pledge to pay a larger amount of the bank loans from the proceeds of any Valeant asset sales. Valeant has been in breach of its reporting covenant since Tuesday, when it missed its 10-K filing deadline, which it has 60 days to resolve. However, if it doesn't file by March 30, it will also be in default with its bank creditors and will have only 30 days to resolve the default.Valeant is about $30 billion in debt after a years-long buying spree, culminating in a failed attempt to buy Allergan (AGN) last year. Allergan subsequently merged with Actavis and is now in the process of being bought by Pfizer (PFE).By late afternoon on the stock market today, Valeant stock lost 11.5% to 29.69. Medical groups tracked by IBD, even those unrelated to drugs, accounted for the seven worst performing groups out of IBD's 197 industries. The generic drugs group led the slide with a 2.8% decline.The hardest-hit individual stocks were Valeant's fellow specialty drugmakers, some of whom have consciously followed Valeant's business model. Mallinckrodt (MNK) authorized a $350 million stock buyback but was down 4.1% to 53.42.  Endo International (ENDP), which is headed by former Valeant executive Rajiv De Silva, hit a three-year low of 27.62, trading down 11.4% to 30.03.Horizon Pharma (HZNP), which has been criticized for pricing policies much as Valeant has, was down 6.8% after selling off for the last three days.Among major drugmakers, Eli Lilly (LLY) tumbled 4.7%. Eli Lilly fell intraday to its lowest level since late 2014.

Tesla (TSLA) added 1.5%, extending its advance for a third straight session. The electric car maker's stock has revved from a Feb. 9 intraday low and is now 5% below its converged 200-day and 50-day lines.On the IBD 50, Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) shed more than 3% in slow turnover, closing above its converged 200-day and 50-day lines.

477,PFE,"Stocks opened to thin losses Wednesday, but the Nasdaq flicked in and out of positive territory.The Dow industrials and S&P 500 eased about 0.1% each, with the Nasdaq moving between fractional gains and losses.Things might have been worse in the stock market today, but a strong February employment report from ADP helped shore up some confidence before the start of trade. Still, the market may be hanging back ahead of the Fed's March Beige Book report, due at 2 p.m. ET. It is the last before the Federal Open Market Committee's March 14-15 meeting, and it could have some impact on afternoon trade.Oil prices stuck to their early losses, with West Texas Intermediate down almost 2% and Brent crude trading 1% lower. The Energy Information Administration reports its weekly inventory data at 10:30 a.m. ET. The weekly inventories estimate from the American Petroleum Institute indicated Tuesday that inventories rose 9.9 million barrels last week, vs. consensus views for a 2.5 million barrel increase.Dow stocks opened generally lower.

"
478,PFE,"Big Pharma player Allergan unveiled what it expects to be its final full year of operation as an independent drug maker before merging into Pfizer, reporting fourth-quarter 2015 earnings that beat expectations and revenue that barely topped Wall Street estimates.Before the market open, Allergan (AGN) said non-GAAP earnings rose 33% to $3.41 per share on a revenue gain of 74% to $4.2 billion. Both metrics exclude discontinuing operations, notably Allergan's Global Generics business that it agreed to sell in July.The Global Generics unit carries the old Actavis name and generic drugs lines of business. Actavis had purchased specialty drug and Botox maker Allergan, a deal that closed in March, and renamed itself Allergan.Allergan stock rose 3.7% in the stock market today, to 285.82, 16% off its all-time high of 340.34, touched July 29. Pfizer (PFE) stock rose 1.9% Monday to 30.05, 18% below a nearly 12-year high set July 31 at 36.46.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Q4 EPS of $3.34 minus items, down 14.6% from $3.91 in 2014, on revenue of $4.192 billion, up 3.4% from Q4 2014's $4.057 billion, although analyst numbers apparently were not uniformly adjusted for discontinuing operations. Allergan presented the pro forma year-earlier numbers as adjusted EPS of $2.57 and revenue of $2.4 billion.For the full year, Allergan said non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations increased 78% to $13.43 on revenue from continuing operations up 124% to $15.07 billion. With varying adjustments, for the full 2015 analysts expected $15.43 per share minus items, up 66% from $9.29 in 2014, on sales of $18.206 billion, up 117% from $8.380 billion in 2014.Allergan reported a Q4  GAAP loss from continuing operations of $2.13 per share, compared to a GAAP loss from continuing operations of $4.48 per share in the prior-year period. It said full GAAP results were impacted by amortization and acquisition expenses, license agreements, impairments, and severance related mainly to the acquisition of Allergan on March 17,  and Kythera on Oct. 1, as well as research and development expenses resulting from the purchase of R&D assets of Mimetogen.Allergan had declined to freshen its guidance upon issuing its Q3 performance Nov. 4, citing early merger discussions with Pfizer back then. But Monday it guided 2016 revenue to about $17 billion, with ""no material changes to gross margins"" from current levels and a non-GAAP tax rate ""normalized"" to about 14%. Management didn't specify EPS for the year nor offer Q1 guidance other than suggesting Q1 performance would be the weakest of the year and fall below Q4 2015 results.Allergan's 2015 results were an analyst's challenge, influenced by its extraordinary M&A dance card. In Q3, it began discontinuing operations of the renamed Actavis generic lines, which it agreed to sell to Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) in July for $40 billion.By Nov. 23, Allergan's board agreed to Pfizer's offer of 11.3 Pfizer shares for each Allergan share, then valuing Allergan at $363.63 a share, or $160 billion for the entire deal, expected to take nine months to close. CEO Brent Saunders told analysts in a conference call following the Q4 earnings release that he still expects the Pfizer buyout to close in the second half of 2016. It would be the second-largest acquisition ever, after the sale of Vodafone AirTouch in 1999 to Mannesmann for $202 billion. Dell's October offer to buy EMC (EMC) is valued at $67 billion. The Pfizer acquisition of Allergan is another in a thinning number of tax inversion deals that allow American companies to domicile in Ireland, Allergan's home base, where the buyer may enjoy a lower tax base. The Obama administration has criticized the practice and thrown up speed bumps, if not road blocks.On Feb. 8,  Pfizer said it plans to reorganize its two broad lines of business into three after the merger with Allergan is complete.Allergan CFO Tessa Hilado told analysts that debt stood at $42.7 billion on Dec. 31 and that $8 billion would be paid down after the close of the Teva sale. She put revenue from top-seller Botox at $656 million in Q4, with eye drug Restasis at $365 million, and Namenda XR at $190 million.  She said the CVS (CVS) purchase of Target (TGT) pharmacies ""had an effect in Q4"" on revenue, but that it didn't and wouldn't impact earnings.

479,PFE,"Mark Finn never saw a market sell-off he didn't like. As portfolio manager of the $21.2 billion T. Rowe Price Value Fund (TRVLX), Finn often uses the dips to set up long-term positions in his mutual fund.The recent December-to-January stock market pullback presented its own set of opportunities for Finn. ""It has been a GDP-scare sell-off,"" he said ""People are worried the economy might tip back into a recession, so cyclicality is on sale right now. What I am looking for in particular are companies where I can get a really attractive dividend yield and (which) generate a lot of free cash flow and (which have) been cheapened because they're perceived to be cyclical business.""Finn is ready to pick his spots should more pullbacks occur in the months ahead. ""I am not overly optimistic about the market overall,"" he said. ""If we end the year flat to where we began, I think that would be as expected. In the interim, I'm getting chances to buy some really good companies with dividend yields of close to 5% that are trading at P/E multiples of 9 or 10 times.""T. Rowe Price Value was down 5.79% year to date going into Thursday vs. declines of 5.61% for its large-cap value peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. and 5.25% for the S&P 500. Over the past five years, the mutual fund has returned an annual average of 9.90%, beating its peers' 7.58% but trailing the S&P 500's 10.46%.The fund carries an IBD 36-Month Performance Rating of A-, meaning it's among the top 10% of all mutual funds in three-year performance.Finn relies upon a robust team of research analysts to help with fundamental stock picking. “We are opportunistically trying to identify and invest in quality companies that are facing some controversy or perceived controversy that we have determined are trading below intrinsic value,” he said. “When we have a good idea, we make it a big position to accrue to the benefit of our shareholders.”As of the end of 2015, General Electric (GE) was T. Rowe Price Value's top holding. Finn is optimistic that GE’s renewed focus on its industrial businesses will help increase margins over time. ""It has been one of the best-performing industrial companies over the last one, three and five years,"" he said. ""I think GE is going to continue to relatively outperform in industrials. They have really figured out what their mission is.""GE has seen its stock price climb 15.9% over the past year. The shares were up almost 1% in the stock market today.Pfizer (PFE), another top holding, has sunk 16% below its 52-week high. ""It has fallen back because of its Allergan (AGN) acquisition, but Pfizer is a phenomenal company with a really nice pipeline of products, and it now has a really good yield,"" Finn said.Pfizer is down 13% from a year ago, but sports a 4.0% dividend yield.In the energy sector, Finn has a favorable outlook for Exelon (EXC). ""It has a great dividend yield, and it looks like there may be a cyclical bottom coming in energy,"" he said.Shares of Exelon yield 4.0% and have gained 12% so far this year.Holdings that Finn sees as undervalued also include International Paper (IP) and AES (AES). “These are companies trading at around a 5% dividend yield, and the market perceives them as being cyclical and risky, but I really don't,” he said.

480,PFE,"Stock futures tacked higher ahead of Monday's open as another bounce in oil prices and positive trade overseas set a positive mood.Dow, Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 futures all swung 1% above fair market value.Key economic news releases this week include January existing-home sales numbers on Tuesday, new-home sales data Wednesday, January's durable goods report Thursday and revisions to the Commerce Department's Q4 GDP on Friday.Today's stock market receives only a small doss of economic news, but opened on a positive note. The Chicago Federal Reserve's National Activity Index turned positive, up 0.28 for January. That reversed a downwardly revised -0.34 for December.Researcher Markit releases its preliminary manufacturing index for February at 9:45 a.m. ET.Monday's trading volume is likely to be sharply below Friday's levels, which were boosted by options expiration trade. This week's critical test will be whether the market can avoid distribution days -- days in which the market slips or stalls in rising volume -- as its young uptrend attempts to get off the ground.Oil prices swayed 4% higher early Monday, sending West Texas Intermediate to almost $31 a barrel. Gold dropped 2% to trade just above $1,207 an ounce.Nearly a third of the Dow rose 1%. Pfizer (PFE) headed the pack with a 1.4% gain. It said late Friday it received expended approval from the Food and Drug Administration for its metastatic breast cancer therapy Ibrance.U.K.-based bank HSBC (HSBC) slumped more than 4% after weighting early trade in Europe. The big cap bank reported losses had improved vs. last year, but came in far short of estimates for a return to profit. Results were hindered, the bank said, by rising charge-offs for loans to U.S. energy plays. The report also noted the bank was one of several under investigation by U.S. authorities for hiring practices in Asia.Energy and mining issues packed the top ranks of the S&P 500 in early trade: Chesapeake Energy (CHK), Freeport McMoRan (FCX), Marathon Oil (MRO) and Kinder Morgan (KMI) were in the top five. So was private label credit card provider Synchrony Financial (SYF), which jumped 4% after a weekend Barron's article said private label cards were gaining market share and named Synchrony as the market leader.Trade was somewhat volatile among IBD 50 stocks, with early gains by O'Reilly Autmotive (ORLY), Broadcom (AVGO) and Netease (NTES) fizzling to flat trade or mild losses. Ryanair (RYAAY) led the declines on the list, down more than 3% in premarket action. The Ireland-based budget airline jumped 8% last week, sending it back above its 10-week moving average in an eight-week pattern that could become a cup base.NetEase surged 11% last week, starting up the right side of its consolidation, but it remains below its 10-week line. O'Reilly and Broadcom are in possible basing patterns that have faced challenges in rising to shape those consolidations into bases.Overseas, Europe's markets pressed firmly higher, with oil and mining stocks helping boost trade. The CAC 40 in Paris and the DAX in Frankfurt were each up 2% near midday. London's FTSE 100 was up more than 1%.In Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index climbed 0.9% apiece, adding to last week's strong gains. The Shanghai Composite, which also posted a healthy gain last week, jumped 2.4% on Monday. 
"
481,PFE,"Big pharma Pfizer (PFE) announced Monday that after it closes its acquisition of Allergan (AGN) it plans to reorganize its three units into two, pending a possible split-up.Back in 2013, Pfizer reorganized its operations into three business units: Innovative Products; Established Products and Vaccines; and Oncology and Consumer Healthcare (VOC). This was widely viewed as a preparation for a split-up of the company. With its pending $160 billion buyout of Allergan,  Pfizer will be adding a large number of drugs, including the wrinkle treatment Botox and a variety of eye-care and skin-care products.On Monday, Pfizer said it plans to combine the innovative products and VOC businesses into one, but that will include a new subdivision called Global Specialty and Consumer Brands that will include most of Allergan's products. The larger Innovative Products business will be headed by current VOC head Albert Bourla, replacing Geno Germano who will leave the company. The new Global Specialty and Consumer Brands division will be headed by Allergan executive Bill Meury. The Established Products business will continue to be led by John Young.Allergan's current CEO Brenton Saunders, meanwhile, is set to become the next president and chief operating officer of Pfizer. It was generally expected on Wall Street that he would land a high-ranking position so that he could be ready to succeed present Pfizer CEO Ian Read.When Pfizer announced the Allergan buyout last year, it said that a decision on a split-up will not be made until 2018, which was a couple of years later than previously expected. Read reiterated this in Monday's announcement.""We are designing the combined company to preserve and enhance our option to potentially separate the innovative and established businesses into separate companies in the future, and continue to expect to make a decision about any potential separation by no later than the end of 2018,"" Read said in a statement.Pfizer stock was down about 1.8% in midday trading on the stock market today, near 28.50. Allergan was down about 3.6% near 264.
"
482,PFE,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) shares climbed as much as 11% Tuesday after the drug maker said it expects to restate earnings, but not by much overall. That may help clear the air after a congressional investigation raised questions about the company's former relationship with distributor Philidor Rx Services and questioned its pricing practices.Specialty drugmaker Valeant said in a written statement late Monday evening that an internal review and additional analysis ""identified certain sales to Philidor during 2014 ... that should have been recognized when product was dispensed to patients rather than on delivery to Philidor.""Valeant said that it currently believes that about $58 million of net revenue that was included in the second half of 2014 should have been booked later.Correcting the misstatements is expected to reduce reported 2014 GAAP earnings per share by about 10 cents to $8.24, Valeant said. But it would  increase its 2015 GAAP EPS by roughly 9 cents. Based on analyst consensus that would lift 2015 EPS to roughly $10.37.Valeant shares closed up 4.4% in the stock market today. Shares had fallen 19.3% on Friday and Monday after Wells Fargo warned of unanswered questions about the company's accounting and strategic direction. The stock fell after hours Monday when the Wall Street Journal said an earnings restatement was likely.Its stock plunged 74% from an Aug. 5, 2015 intraday high of 262.52 after the questionable numbers came to light, to a 69.33 low on Nov. 18.In the statement, Valeant noted that the sales occurred prior its earlier bid to acquire Philidor. Specialty pharmacy Philidor was suspected of filling prescriptions for Valeant that altered doctors' orders to raise insurer reimbursements, Bloomberg said in an Oct. 29 report, citing former employees and an internal document.On Oct. 30, Valeant said it was severing ties with Philidor, which subsequently began winding down operations.Interim Chief Executive Howard Schiller said in the statement the company also expects to delay filing its 2015 10-K until its completed ""review of related accounting matters by its ad hoc committee.""This determination and the need to delay our 10-K filing are very disappointing but necessary,"" Schiller said, adding,  ""We remain committed to improving reporting procedures, internal controls and transparency for our investors.Schiller was named to the post on an interim basis on Jan. 6, filling in for ailing CEO J. Michael Pearson, who is being treated for severe pneumonia and complications.Valeant will release unaudited Q4 results on Feb. 29.Private label over-the-counter and prescription generic drugmaker Perrigo's (PRGO) shares have been battered too, and fell to the lowest point in about 2-1/2 years Monday. Perrigo lost 15% in three sessions after reporting weak fourth quarter earnings last Thursday and being downgraded by analysts on earnings. Perrigo closed up 0.6%.Big pharma Allergan (AGN), which reported a 33% hike n Q4 EPS and a 74% jump in revenue Monday, rose 3.7% Monday, and finished up 0.3% Tuesday. Allergan agreed in November to be acquired by Pfizer (PFE) for $160 billion and that deal is expected to close this year.

483,PFE,"When the economy is entering a recession, stocks in consumer staples, health care and telecoms ""are the best places to hide,"" said Barclays' Jonathan Glionna, who names tobacco giants Philip Morris International (PM) and Reynolds American (RAI) and drug giants Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE).Meanwhile, he includes General Electric (GE) among the stocks to buy for a recovery.He doesn't see a recession in the near term, but there are red flags such as the collapse of oil prices, the 10% retreat in the S&P 500 so far this year and slowing growth in global No. 2 economy China.In a report Monday, Glionna joined a growing number of analysts providing lists of recession-resistant stocks. But he took a slightly different tack from others, offering two lists: a Recession Playbook and a Recovery Playbook.Among other top picks on his Recession Playbook are Campbell Soup (CPB), Coca-Cola (KO), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Hormel Foods (HRL).Philip Morris stock closed up 0.3% Tuesday, and Reynolds American, the maker of Camel cigarettes, added 1.3%. Merck gained 0.7%, and Pfizer rose 1.9%. Campbell Soup climbed 1.7%, while Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble ended flat.Glionna said of his Recovery Playbook: ""The best performing sectors in previous periods of economic recovery -- using the exit of a recession as indicative of a recovery -- have been energy, materials, industrials and consumer discretionary.""Among stocks on that list: Ford Motor (F), General Electric, General Motors (GM), Harley-Davidson (HOG) and Viacom (VIA).Ford ended down 2%, and GM lost 2.8% Tuesday. GE ticked up 0.4%. Harley-Davidson fell 1.5%, and Viacom plunged more than 21% on worse-than-expected results for the December-ended quarter.Meanwhile, Cowen analysts put out their own list of recession stocks Tuesday, saying, ""We believe stocks that appeal to the low-end consumer and have minimal global exposure appear well-suited to weather an economic downturn.""Among their top picks: off-price clothing retailer Ross Stores (ROST) and Wal-Mart Stores (WMT).Ross Stores climbed 2.25%, and Wal-Mart fell 1.6%.
"
484,PFE,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) and Perrigo (PRGO) shares continued to tumble Monday, generally pulling the drug sector down with them. Allergan (AGN) was an exception, rising on strong earnings.Valeant late Monday tumbled as low as 68 -- which would be the lowest since March 2013 -- on a Dow Jones report that Valeant Pharmaceuticals would likely restate earnings. Hours later Valeant said a restatement for 2014 and 2015 earnings is expected, related to sales of drugs to ex-distributor Philidor. Valeant said $58 million in sales in late 2014 should have been recognized later. Valeant expects 2014 earnings to be lowered by 10 cents a share, with 2015 EPS lifted by 9 cents.During the regular session, Valeant shares closed down 10.7% at 75.92  in the stock market today, extending losses on a bearish report from Wells Fargo Friday. Valeant shares dived nearly 10% that day after Wells Fargo initiated coverage on the maker of branded drugs to treat eye diseases, acne, depression and other ailments with an underperform, saying there were ""unanswered questions"" about its accounting methods and strategic direction.Earlier Monday, drugstore giant CVS Health (CVS) said it plans to restrict use of Valeant's Jublia toenail fungus drug as part of an initiative to cut costs for dermatology treatments. Jublia retails at about $1,000 for an 8-milliliter bottle, according to the website GoodRx.Valeant stock price has plunged 69% from a Sept. 21 intraday high at 245.82 despite double-digit quarterly earnings and revenue growth for nearly four years. Bill Ackman's Pershing Square hedge fund is down significantly this year partly because of the fund's large stake in Valeant.Valeant had already been battered by a series of events including the absence of CEO J. Michael Pearson, who is being treated for severe pneumonia and complications. On Jan. 6, Valeant's board named board member and former Chief Financial Officer Howard Schiller A interim CEO.Earlier this month, Valeant interim CEO Schiller was called before Congress to explain why the company decided to increase the prices of two cardiac drugs by 525% and 212%. Schiller promised to end an era of sharp price hikes.Perrigo, whose business model is divided between private-label over-the-counter and prescription generic drugs, fell 4.1% to 124.08 Monday to its lowest level since late 2013.The stock has lost 15% over three sessions, after Perrigo reported weak fourth quarter results on Thursday and subsequently had negative reports by Jefferies on Friday and by Goldman Sachs on Monday.Jefferies cut its price target to 163 from 209 although it maintained a buy rating. Goldman Sachs, however, downgraded the stock from neutral to sell, with a 124 price target, reports said.Perrigo reported $1.80 Q4 EPS minus one-time items, 13 cents below estimates. It was the company's first earnings miss in five quarters. Revenue grew 33% to $1.425 billion. Analysts expected $1.461 billion.Mylan (MYL) last year made an offer for Perrigo, which Perrigo shareholders in mid-November rejected. Mylan rose 3.2% Monday.Big pharma Allergan (AGN) reported what it expects to be its final full earnings report as an independent drug maker after it agreed in November to be bought by Pfizer (PFE) for $160 billion.Allergan's Q4 EPS ex items rose 33% to $3.41 on a 74% hike in revenue to $4.2 billion. Wall Street expected $3.34 EPS and $4.19 billion revenue.Allergan shares climbed 3.7% to 285.82. Pfizer rose 1.9%.But IBD's generic drugs and ethical (branded) drug groups were among the rare losers on an otherwise strong day for stocks.    
"
485,PFE,"Medical stocks Pfizer (PFE), Mallinckrodt (MNK) and Baxter International (BAX) were all on the move Tuesday after early quarterly reports and guidance.Pfizer said Q4 revenue rose 7% over the year-earlier quarter to $14.05 billion, beating analysts' consensus by about $45 million, according to Thomson Reuters. Earnings, excluding one-time items, slipped 2% to 53 cents a share, beating estimates by a penny.For the year, EPS declined 3% to $2.20, while sales slid 2% to $48.85 billion.However, Pfizer's 2016 profit guidance missed Wall Street's expectations of $2.20 to $2.30 a share. Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum blamed foreign-exchange headwinds.""Excluding a roughly negative $2.3 billion top line ($0.8 billion of top line FX impact due to Venezuela currency impact alone) and $0.16 bottom line impact due to FX, both 2016 top and bottom line guidance would have bracketed the Street,"" Schoenebaum wrote in an email. ""We spoke with Pfizer, and they believe that the Street underestimated the FX impact in 2016.""Pfizer stock was down0.7% to 29.97 in afternoon trading on the stock market today.Pfizer also said that it had ended a midstage trial of an experimental Alzheimer's disease drug in October after an independent data-monitoring committee said that it would be futile to continue. The drug, PF-05212377, targeted a brain receptor called 5HT6, similar to another drug, RVT-101, currently in late-stage testing by Axovant Sciences (AXON). Since RVT-101 is one of only two drugs in Axovant's pipeline, Axovant stock was down 23% intraday, hitting a three-month low.Mallinckrodt, meanwhile, was up 5.5% Tuesday afternoon, after the specialty drugmaker reported fiscal-first-quarter earnings of $2.09 a share, up 17% from the year-earlier quarter and topping consensus by 31 cents. Sales climbed 19% to $914.8 million, some $25 million above the Street's average estimate.Mallinckrodt raised its full-year EPS guidance to $7.85 to $8.30, up from $7.70 to $8.20.Leerink analyst Jason Gerberry wrote that the beat looked ""high quality"" given its reasons, and he said selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were less than expected.""(1) biggest driver was low SG&A spend of 24.9% of sales vs. our/Street assumption for spend in the 28% range,"" Gerberry wrote in a research note. ""This was partially offset by higher R&D spend in the quarter; (2) followed by sales mix which drove higher gross margin on the quarter (74.3% vs. our 72.6%); and (3) a top-line beat driven by specialty brands.""Baxter also beat expectations in the most recent quarter, pulling off a sharp increase in earnings despite a decline in sales. Q4 profit from continuing operations jumped 54% to 43 cents a share, 11 cents past Wall Street's consensus. Revenue dropped 7% to $2.6 billion.Baxter said it expects EPS this year of $1.46 to $1.54, beating consensus of $1.42. Its forecast for the current quarter was below the Street, however, at 28 to 30 cents.Baxter's comparisons were somewhat complicated by the fact that in July it spun off its biopharma arm as Baxalta (BXLT), leaving a business comprised mostly of dialysis and hospital products that accounted for 60% of the previous company. But Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy wrote that its path as an independent company is becoming clearer.""Now post-split, Baxter is a margin expansion story as the company works down dis-synergies, implements broader cost controls, and executes on new product launches,"" Antalffy wrote in a research note. ""With two quarterly data points now in hand, it seems clear that Baxter is on track to exceed its margin expansion trajectory that the company laid out at the May analyst meeting -- adjusted operating margin expansion from 9% immediately post-split to 10% in 2016, ramping to 14% in 2020.""Baxter stock was up 1% in afternoon trading.

486,PFE,"Big biotech Gilead Sciences (GILD) beat analysts' Q4 estimates Tuesday but its guidance was soft, sending the stock up more than 1% in after-hours trading, in a day when several large drugmakers reported.Gilead's earnings rose 37% over the year-earlier quarter to $3.32 per share, topping analysts' EPS consensus by 32 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue increased 16% to $8.51 billion, vs. analysts' expectation of $8.13 billion.For the full year, EPS rose 56% to $12.61 while revenue gained 31% to $32.64 billion.Gilead guided 2016 product sales, which covers nearly all revenue, at $30 billion to $31 billion. Analysts had expected $30.68 billion in product sales and total revenue of $31.68 billion. Gilead does not provide total revenue or EPS guidance, but it did provide guidance on expenses, which were slightly above expectations on the R&D and sales, general and administrative lines. Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum calculated that the implied EPS guidance for 2016 is $10.48 to $11.92, which would miss consensus of $12.23.In Q4, the hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni both beat estimates, though entirely due to sales outside the U.S., where analysts have less visibility. Next year's expected revenue decline is due to an anticipated decline in U.S. HCV market, which had an enormous lift-off when the two drugs were approved but has flattened as ever-larger numbers of patients have been cured of the disease.On the conference call with analysts, commercial-operations chief Paul Carter said that they could expect the HCV market in 2016 to behave similarly to how it did in the second half of 2015, essentially flat in the U.S. while growing in foreign markets where it is still being launched. He said that it might see some growth as payers seem to be loosening their restrictions on the drugs, which initially strained their finances due to their high prices and the enormous volume of patients. However, he acknowledged that revenue per patient was likely to fall as less-sick patients came aboard, requiring shorter treatments.Carter also sounded confident about Gilead's ability to fend off competition, which got a new entrant last week when Merck's (MRK) Zepatier was approved last week and priced well below both Gilead's and AbbVie's (ABBV) HCV drugs.""We're confident our label is very strong, and we're very much supported by the real-world data we've seen since the launch of Harvoni,"" Carter said.Earlier in the day, big pharma Pfizer (PFE) said Q4 revenue rose 7% over the year-earlier quarter to $14.05 billion, beating analysts’ consensus by about $45 million. Earnings, excluding one-time items, slipped 2% to 53 cents a share, beating estimates by a penny.For the year, EPS declined 3% to $2.20, while sales slid 2% to $48.85 billion.However, Pfizer’s 2016 profit guidance missed Wall Street’s expectations of $2.20 to $2.30 a share. Analyst Schoenebaum blamed foreign-exchange headwinds.“Excluding a roughly negative $2.3 billion top line ($0.8 billion of top line FX impact due to Venezuela currency impact alone) and $0.16 bottom line impact due to FX, both 2016 top and bottom line guidance would have bracketed the Street,” Schoenebaum wrote in an email. “We spoke with Pfizer, and they believe that the Street underestimated the FX impact in 2016.”S&P Capital IQ analyst Jeffrey Loo raised his rating on Pfizer to buy from hold, saying the valuation has become attractive after it, like almost every other drug stock around, has sold off in recent months.""We view growth within its Global Innovative Products unit positively, driven by Prevnar 13 and Ibrance,"" Loo wrote in a research note. ""We expect its pending acquisition of Allergan (AGN) to be completed in the second half of 2016.""Pfizer stock closed down 0.1% at 30.14.Mallinckrodt (MNK) rose 5.7% to close at 65.71, after the specialty drugmaker reported fiscal-first-quarter earnings of $2.09 a share, up 17% from the year-earlier quarter and topping consensus by 31 cents. Sales climbed 19% to $914.8 million, some $25 million above the Street’s average estimate.Mallinckrodt raised its full-year EPS guidance to $7.85 to $8.30, up from $7.70 to $8.20.Baxter International (BAX), a leader in dialysis products, also beat expectations in the most recent quarter, pulling off a sharp increase in earnings despite a decline in sales. Fourth quarter profit from continuing operations jumped 54% to 43 cents a share, 11 cents past Wall Street’s consensus. Revenue dropped 7% to $2.6 billion. Baxter stock rose 1.8% Tuesday to close at 37.95.Baxter said it expects EPS this year of $1.46 to $1.54, beating consensus of $1.42. Its forecast for the current quarter was below the Street, however, at 28 to 30 cents.

515,PFE,"Dow Chemical (DOW) and DuPont (DD) are in advanced talks to create a chemicals giant, according to multiple reports, in what could cap a record year for merger activity, including last month's $160 billion deal for Pfizer (PFE) to buy Allergan (AGN).The merged Dow-DuPont firm would then split into three separately traded companies, according to the Wall Street Journal and CNBC's David Faber.

517,PFE,"Special Report: Income Investing 2016Dividends can yield a steady stream of income for investors. Leading fund managers have used game plans focused on buying select dividend-paying stocks to boost total returns and drive outperformance.T. Rowe Price Dividend Growth Fund and Columbia Dividend Income Fund have been among the top mutual funds for dividend investors over the last decade. Here are some insights from the managers who have executed successful dividend investment strategies.T. Rowe Dividend GrowthTom Huber has beaten large blend funds tracked by Morningstar by an annual average of 136 basis points over the last 10 years as manager of the T. Rowe Price Dividend Growth Fund.He points out that dividends can prove to be a substantial portion of investors' total returns. ""Over time, dividends have made up 40% to 50% of total returns,"" Huber said. ""It gets lost a little bit when markets are strong and compounding at double-digit rates, but if you look back over history, dividends have been an important source of returns for investors.""For income investors, Huber emphasizes the importance of buying stocks of companies that have been able to increase their dividends over time. ""A track record of dividend growth is a good sign of a quality business, financial health and durability,"" he said. ""In addition to offering investors a growing stream of income, dividend-paying stocks also tend to be less volatile and offer some downside protection.""Dividend Growth is designed to reward patient investors. ""There are market environments where our strategy does better and environments when it is going to lag,"" Huber said. ""In big up markets, dividend stocks tend to be a bit out of favor, but when growth moderates and the market corrects, they tend to hold up better.""Dividend Growth sticks with many of its bets for the long haul. ""We have a relatively low turnover,"" Huber said of the mutual fund's 19% turnover ratio. ""We want to own these companies over time and benefit from the compounding effect of earnings, cash flow and dividend growth.""In comparing Dividend Growth to a generic growth fund, Huber points out the low turnover can be advantageous for tax purposes. ""The percentage distribution between dividends and capital gains will likely vary between the two (funds), but tax rates on the two are similar,"" he said. ""Our fund has a turnover rate that runs between 10% and 30%, which is much lower than peers and helps limit taxable events.""The fund's top holding, Danaher (DHR), has been a mainstay in the Dividend Growth portfolio for much of Huber's tenure. ""It yields less than a percent but does raise its dividend nicely every year,"" he said. ""It's a diversified industrial company of better-than-average businesses, characterized by higher-than-average margins and free cash flow conversion.""Pfizer (PFE) is Huber's No. 2 holding. ""The company has been growing its dividend at about a 10% rate over the last five years,"" he said. ""Pfizer has an underappreciated pipeline. It's not an expensive stock and has a yield over 3%.""Huber sees General Electric (GE) shareholders benefiting from the company divesting much of its financial services unit. ""You end up with an industrial earnings stream which is much less volatile than it had been previously,"" he said of the fund's No. 3 holding. ""It will be a higher-quality, more durable mix of businesses, and in the meantime you collect a dividend yield of 3%.""Columbia Dividend IncomeColumbia Dividend Income Fund is co-managed by Scott Davis, Michael Barclay and Peter Santoro. It has topped large value funds tracked by Morningstar by an average of 186 basis points for the past 10 years.To achieve this outperformance, the trio thoroughly assesses the long-term business prospects of a dividend-paying company before buying. ""When we look at stocks, we do not look at the dividend first,"" Davis said. ""We look at a company's corporate structure and its ability to generate cash from operations. To sustain a dividend, you need to have a healthy company that can afford to pay it.""Davis emphasizes that the fund's dividend investment strategy does not get caught up in chasing yield. ""It's not just about focusing on the highest-yielding stocks,"" Davis said. ""It really has to do with the sustainability of a dividend and a company's ability to grow the dividend.""Barclay notes that the fund's portfolio provides ample downside protection. ""One of the hallmarks of our product is that it keeps investors from getting hit hard when the stock market goes down,"" he said. ""By doing that, clients stay engaged and are still in the fund when the market turns around and goes back up.""Cash Flow GeneratorsAs of Sept. 30, Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) were the top two holdings. ""Not only do Microsoft and Apple have superior free cash flow generation, but they are actually growing,"" Barclay said. ""When you can find a company that is growing its top line and producing strong free cash flow because of strong operating margins, that's a formula for good growth and sustainability of the dividend.""The fund's top consumer cyclical holding is Home Depot (HD). ""We continue to see home improvement projects gaining consumer wallet share,"" Santoro said. ""Home Depot has done a great job of anticipating consumer needs. They have also been good stewards of capital and have been raising cash flow expectations.""The portfolio has held a position in Exxon Mobil (XOM) since 2003. ""Exxon has probably the best balance sheet in the whole industry,"" Santoro said. ""It pays a dividend of almost 4% and is incredibly secure.""

519,PFE,"Asian mkts closed mixed  overnight and as noted European mkts are lower following an uninspiring day yesterday here in the states as well as in Asia.  Concerns over terrorist threats and the latest news continues to dominate the conversation - Brussels is on lockdown for the 4th straight day as police hunt for a 'prime suspect' responsible for the Paris attacks, the US and 'allied nations' continue to punish ISIS and the US issues a 'global travel warning' ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.    Yesterday stocks rose at the opening bell only to sell off as we moved into the close. It seemed that neither the bulls nor the bears were really in control as the mkt waffled.  The major indexes finished the day just south of the unchanged line — The Dow lower by 31pts, the Nasdaq unchanged while the S&P 500 slipped 2 points.

520,PFE,"On the deal front - Yesterday brought the news that Pfizer (American based) and Allergan (AGN) (Ireland based)  had in fact reached a 'deal' to combine companies allowing Pfizer (PFE) engage in a 'reverse merger' — taking full advantage of the inversion trade that we spoke about last week.  This deal valued at $150 billion will not only create the world’s biggest drug maker — but it will also result in huge tax savings for the newly combined company that will now be domiciled in Dublin — where corp tax rates are a fraction of the 35% rate here in the states.  The ink was not even dry yet on the morning papers before the screaming started over whose fault this was and how could this happen?  For Pfizer it is a brilliant deal right?  They took full advantage of a broken US corp tax system — a system that has been broken for years but that no one in DC chooses to address.....— yes they may recognize it and may have been talking about it ad naseum but in the end they have done NOTHING and now they are all screaming about it.  GOP frontrunner — The Donald — called the deal 'disgusting' and took direct aim at the politicians saying that ""our politicians should be ashamed of themselves for a tax system that encourages such moves…”  this coincidentally from someone that has used the system to his advantage (via bankruptcy)  a number of times makes you wonder - if he were in a position to do an inversion deal and cut his taxes via a sanctioned loop hole - what would he do???  But he is now running for President — so I guess his perspective changes.  The Democrats — not be out done - jumped on the bandwagon as well with Cousin Bernie (Sanders) — a former US Senator -  calling it 'disgusting' while encouraging the current administration to block it.  Hillary — the former US senator, Secretary of State and first lady — said that she would all of a sudden - 'propose specific business tax proposals while urging Congress to act immediately to make sure the biggest corporations pay their fair share so that the US taxpayer is not left holding the bag' .

524,PFE,"Big pharma Pfizer fulfilled weeks of rumors Monday, announcing a deal to buy specialty-drug giant Allergan in a stock swap valued at $160 billion, heating up the political debate over tax-inversion deals.Pfizer (PFE) agreed to provide Allergan (AGN) shareholders with 11.3 Pfizer shares for each Allergan share , which — based on Friday's closing price — values Allergan at $363.63 a share.This price was somewhat lower than last week's anonymously sourced press reports pegging the price at $370 to $380 a share. But it was still a 16% premium on Allergan's Friday closing price.That makes the deal the second-largest M&A ever, said Thomson Reuters, behind only Mannesmann's $202 billion acquisition of Vodafone AirTouch in 1999. It's more than twice the value of the largest tech coupling ever, the $67 billion merger of Dell and EMC (EMC) announced in October.But the terms disappointed investors. Allergan stock fell 3.4% and Pfizer fell 2.6% on Monday. (Pfizer's drop lowered the value of the deal to $354.03 per Allergan share.)As expected, the deal will allow Pfizer to perform a tax inversion and domicile in Allergan's official homeland of Ireland, which will lead Pfizer to rename itself Pfizer PLC at the expected close of the deal in about nine months.Pfizer said that the inversion would result in a pro forma tax rate of 17% to 18%, which would cut more than $1 billion from the company's tax bill. Overall, Pfizer expects some $2 billion in cost savings in the first three years of the combination, though it doesn't forecast earnings accretion until 2018.Allergan shareholders will end up owning about 44% of the combined company, which should steer it clear of last week's new Treasury guidelines attempting to tighten the rules on such tax-inversion deals. Those rules targeted more lopsided deals in which the U.S. acquirer tries to redomicile while still owning more than 80% of the company.'Full' Tax BenefitsOn a conference call with analysts Monday morning discussing the merger, Pfizer CEO Ian Read said that he expects to realize the ""full benefits"" of a tax inversion, though he hastened to add that trimming the tax bill wasn't the only reason for the deal.He said that one pleasant surprise in Pfizer's due diligence was discovering the strength of Allergan's drug franchises — which, he says, Pfizer can further expand abroad, thanks to its vast global infrastructure.""Allergan expands our leadership position by bringing very strong franchises in aesthetics, dermatology, eye care, GI (gastrointestinal diseases), women's health, urology and anti-infectives,"" Read said. ""Some of you may remember that several years ago, Pfizer decided to exit or de-prioritize these areas, not because they were unattractive but because we did not have the scale, expertise or market-leading positions to be competitive. With Allergan, we gain access to expertise and market-leading products in these areas.""Read said that this lack of overlap between the two companies' product lines was one reason why the $2 billion projection in cost savings was somewhat lower than what analysts expected. He said that Pfizer plans to keep most of Allergan's operations and employees in Southern California — where it was originally headquartered before M&A brought it the Irish domicile — implying that there will not be big layoffs.Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum theorized on a webinar for clients that preserving U.S. jobs might also be a way to deflect criticism for depriving the U.S. of tax income.If so, it didn't entirely work, as Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders both criticized the deal Monday.""In the weeks ahead, I will propose specific steps to prevent these kind of transactions, which take advantage of loopholes that litter our tax code, distort incentives for investment and disadvantage small businesses and domestic firms that cannot game the international tax system,"" Clinton said in a statement.The buyout deal includes a $3.5 billion breakup fee, but it's likely that any real change to the legal regime would come only after a new president and Congress are sworn in early 2017, which is after the deal is expected to close, say analysts.Edison Investment analyst Maxim Jacobs, however, said that the Federal Trade Commission might look askance at such an enormous entity, even if it passes the Treasury's restrictions.""Although the Pfizer/Allergan deal appears to have been consummated and is attractive to both sides, the U.S. regulatory reaction to this very high-profile merger remains an unknown and may very well be negative due to the size of the tax inversion,"" Jacobs wrote in an email.Read will remain chairman and CEO of the combined company, while Allergan CEO Brent Saunders will become president and chief operating officer. This arrangement seemed to support pre-deal speculation that Saunders was being viewed as a potential successor to Read, who's 15 years older than Saunders.Pfizer also said that it will delay until 2018 making a decision about splitting up its innovative and established (i.e., old and generic) products into two or three businesses, a move that had been expected next year.Analysts on the call weren't happy about the delay, but Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said that he still expects the split to happen eventually.""Ultimately, the cash flows of the combined entity likely will quickly exceed $25 billion, but without a split, we believe that overall operational complexity is likely to be too high to drive innovative growth,"" Fernandez wrote in a research note.

558,PFE,"One-hundred-forty characters can do a whole lotta damage. A Hillary Clinton tweet Sept. 21, deploring ""outrageous"" ""price gouging"" in the specialty drug market, saw the largest biotech ETF tank 5% on Sept. 21 on fears of pricing controls.At the end of the third quarter, iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) had given up all its gains year to date on the back of roughly 11% losses in both September and August (it's since rallied a tad).But the unsettling decline in the health care sector belies its outlook, say S&P Capital IQ analysts.""Higher enrollments, cost management and prescription drug sales will continue to drive the best (earnings) growth"" for health care among 10 sectors in the S&P 500 index, analyst Lindsey Bell wrote Sept. 17.Indeed, IBB produced an annual average 30% gain in the past five years as of Oct. 2. In that period, out of 154 sector ETFs tracked by IBD, the top 10 each targeted the health sector.In fact, now more than ever, with biotech and pharma ETFs trading as much as 25% below their 52-week highs, S&P Capital IQ sees a buying opportunity in solid biotech names such as Gilead (GILD) and Celgene (CELG), an IBD 50 stock.Nearly 11.7 million people are newly insured through ObamaCare health exchanges, the firm noted in a recent report. That should drive sales for health care providers and services. A strong dollar is likely to weigh on large-cap pharmaceuticals, but the Big Four — Pfizer (PFE), Merck (MRK), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Eli Lilly (LLY) — should ""once again post top-line growth in 2016 for the first time in five years as they pass the patent cliff,"" the report said.Plus, the health care index is nicely valued vs. its 15-year average.""Upside is especially attainable"" within the biotech, pharma and equipment subindustries, the report added.The big upside potential has seen sometimes-risky biotech and drug stocks make their way into many investors' ETF strategies. But now, with China and a global slowdown on their minds, investors are more focused on downside risk.They may be right to be cautious.""While value stocks are at risk should economic growth estimates continue to come down, momentum companies are exposed to more spikes in volatility,"" which has weighed on biotechs lately, Russ Koesterich, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock, wrote recently.He suggested investors consider quality stocks — ""which generally have strong return on equity and low debt"" — for successful investing if the markets stay choppy.Analysts at BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research agree.In a new report, they say health care rates as the most attractive sector based on measures that have historically been best at predicting results, such as EPS and sales revisions, guidance and the prior quarter's results.Stick with health care to stick with quality, BofA Merrill Lynch advised.
"
559,PFE,"When big biotechs Amgen and Regeneron launched their new cholesterol drugs Repatha and Praluent this summer, Wall Street uniformly predicted blockbuster sales, though they debated just how big.
"
560,PFE,"After all, one in seven adult Americans have high cholesterol, and Pfizer's (PFE) Lipitor was the biggest-selling drug in the world before it went off patent in 2011 and got generic rivals.
"
561,PFE,"Yet the statins — the drug class to which Lipitor belongs — aren't enough for everyone. Repatha and Praluent, both in a new class called PCSK9 inhibitors, promise to help many of those people whose cholesterol is still too high.
"
562,PFE,"In mid-September, Amgen (AMGN) made an acquisition that signaled where the future might lie. The company agreed to pay $300 million upfront for Dezima Pharma, a company developing a drug called a cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor. That drug class, which is also being developed by Merck (MRK) and Eli Lilly (LLY), also promises to lower cholesterol for those inadequately treated by statins. But besides lowering LDL bad cholesterol, they've also shown the ability to raise HDL good cholesterol.
"
563,PFE,"In contrast to the biweekly injections required for Amgen's and Regeneron's (REGN) treatments, the CETPs can be taken in one daily pill.
"
564,PFE,"If Dezima's drug candidate succeeds, Amgen is on the hook for up to $1.25 billion in milestone payments. But that could be well worth it if the CETP class turns out to be a real threat.
"
565,PFE,"""It provides a natural hedge on Amgen's important cardiovascular franchise, given PCSK9 Repatha could be a $4 billion-to-$5 billion drug but is injectable, while Phase III competitor CETP inhibitors from Lilly and Merck are oral,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee in a research note on Sept. 16, the day the deal was announced.
"
566,PFE,"For Wall Street, success is a big if. The drug in the class to first make it to phase-three testing, Pfizer's torcetrapib, came to a screeching halt when Pfizer realized the drug was raising patients' death rate by increasing their blood pressure.
"
567,PFE,"""It really shook up the field, because there were high hopes for torcetrapib,"" Daniel Bloomfield, vice president of clinical research in Merck's cardiovascular program, told IBD. ""When they announced their results, we put our program on hold and started to work through some of the issues.""
"
568,PFE,"Bloomfield said Merck isolated the hormone that was responsible for raising blood pressure in Pfizer's trial, and could demonstrate that its own drug, anacetrapib, did not have that risk factor. Lilly also says it's confident its CETP inhibitor, evacetrapib, is safer than its predecessor.
"
569,PFE,"""We enrolled our first patient in 2012, and we have 12,000 patients, most of (whom) are many, many months on treatment without any evidence of a safety signal,"" said Jeffrey Riesmeyer, senior medical director of Lilly's cardiovascular program.
"
570,PFE,"At the same time, though, there's a danger of making the drug too weak. That happened with Roche's (RHHBY) CETP inhibitor dalcetrapib. Its phase-three trial showed no safety problems, but it raised HDL by only 30% — where other candidates have typically raised it in the triple digits — and it didn't affect LDL at all.
"
571,PFE,"This history is the reason PCSK9s are available now, while the CETP inhibitors won't be on the market for at least two years. Amgen and Regeneron were able to win approval on the basis of their cholesterol-lowering powers before the companies demonstrated the drugs' effect on overall cardiovascular health. Both Merck and Lilly, however, are going to complete their cardiovascular outcome studies before they apply for approval.
"
572,PFE,"""When we first started working on anacetrapib, we had alignment with the FDA that they would approve the drug based on LDL lowering,"" Bloomfield said. ""I think (now) the FDA wants to see evidence of outcomes benefit before they approve a drug in this class. I think we want to see it as well, given that shadow overhanging the mechanism.""
"
573,PFE,"Lilly's trial is expected to be done by mid-2016, and Merck's by early 2017, which is also when the PCSK9 data are expected to start coming in. Both companies are studying similar patient groups to those in the PCSK9 trials — mainly those who already have heart disease. Virtually all of them are already on statins and many of them are also taking diabetes medicines, Riesmeyer notes.
"
574,PFE,"Since Lilly's diabetes drug Jardiance was recently shown to improve heart health by itself, the two drugs might work in tandem, Riesmeyer notes.
"
575,PFE,"The main difference between the two drugs is that Merck's anacetrapib has a longer half-life, or time that the drug remains in the body — traces of the drug have been detected in patients up to four years after their last dose. Lilly's Riesmeyer points to this as a potential safety issue, though that has yet to be proved.
"
576,PFE,"So far, the CETP inhibitors' ability to lower LDL has lagged behind the PCSK9s. In its phase-three trial, Praluent reduced LDL by 58%, and Repatha performed similarly. Anacetripib and evacetrapib have lowered it 20% to 40%, though they've also raised HDL as much as 140%. Dezima's drug TA-8995, which has gone through phase two, lowered LDL 40% to 50% while raising HDL 160%, which Amgen advertised when it announced the deal.
"
577,PFE,"""Assuming the LDL hypothesis holds true for CETP's, TA-8995 may potentially be best-in-class,"" wrote Leerink analysts in a July 8 deep-dive report on the cholesterol market.
"
578,PFE,"The uncertainty about the exact connection between cholesterol and heart health leaves it unclear just how this could translate to market share. And Merck's Bloomfield says that will likely be the key factor.
"
579,PFE,"""That's not to say the magnitude of the benefit, the safety and tolerability profile, and the price vs. generics aren't going to be important,"" he said. ""All four of those factors would be important, but I would expect that outcomes would be the required entry into taking significant market share.""When big biotechs Amgen and Regeneron launched their new cholesterol drugs Repatha and Praluent this summer, Wall Street uniformly predicted blockbuster sales, though they debated just how big.After all, one in seven adult Americans have high cholesterol, and Pfizer's (PFE) Lipitor was the biggest-selling drug in the world before it went off patent in 2011 and got generic rivals.Yet the statins — the drug class to which Lipitor belongs — aren't enough for everyone.

Dow futures were up 109 points, down from a 26-point gain an hour earlier. Nasdaq 100 futures slimmed their advance to 4.8 points above fair market value. S&P 500 futures hovered with a slim, 1.8-point gain. Small caps lagged, with Russell 2000 futures slipping 1.6 points.The stock market today starts the week under some mixed signals.

"
621,PFE,"Big pharma Pfizer (PFE) was reportedly near a deal to acquire Ireland-based Allergan (AGN) on Thursday, even as the Treasury Department said it would put out new guidance to cut the economic benefits of such deals.Pfizer and Allergan confirmed rumors that they were in such talks late last month, but details such as price were left to Wall Street speculation. Late Wednesday, however, Bloomberg and Reuters both reported that the price had been set in the range of $370 to $380 a share, which would total up to $157 billion. Bloomberg said the deal could be announced ""as soon as Monday,"" but CNBC said Thursday that the announcement is expected the following Monday.All this came just hours after Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew sent a letter to the Senate Finance Committee criticizing tax-inversion deals, in which a U.S. company acquires a smaller company in a lower-tax domicile in a sort of reverse acquisition that allows the U.S. company to relocate and cut its tax bill. Pfizer already tried to do this last year by acquiring British drug giant AstraZeneca (AZN) but was rebuffed, so the pursuit of Dublin-based Allergan is generally seen as an alternative inversion deal.Lew said in his letter that later this week Treasury will issue ""targeted guidance to deter and reduce further the economic benefits of corporate inversions."" Treasury had previously issued guidelines to that effect back in September 2014, which, as Evercore ISI policy analyst Terry Haines points out, never resulted in any actual changes of rules.""The 2014 'guidance' said Treasury would — but never did — propose new regulations to combat hopscotch loans; prevent restructuring of foreign subsidiaries; prevent inverted companies from transferring cash or property from a controlled foreign corporation to avoid U.S. tax; and strengthen its interpretation of the ownership rule,"" Haines wrote in an email to clients. ""Treasury also said it intended to take comment on earnings stripping: That also was not done.""Just What Can Treasury Do?In his letter, Lew boasted that his guidelines did slow down the previously torrid rate of tax-inversion deals — indeed, it torpedoed AbbVie's (ABBV) planned takeover of Shire (SHPG), with AbbVie deciding to pay a hefty termination fee rather than take the risk of the rules materializing. Haines' Evercore colleague, specialty-drug analyst Umer Raffat, wrote in a separate email that Lew might follow up with actual guidelines this time, and/or address the issue of earnings stripping, in which the inverted company's foreign HQ issues an intercompany loan to its U.S. subsidiary and charges tax-deductible interest.""In my prior conversation with legal experts, Treasury may not have the mandate to change the 50% cap on interest expense deduction,"" Raffat wrote. ""It will be very interesting to see if Treasury comes out and changes this threshold in the guidance anyways — and lets any concerned parties litigate it out (hoping that the timelines for litigation will be long enough to prevent an inversion transaction).""Raffat added that Treasury might also propose modifying the definition of ""debt"" to exclude such intercompany loans. After the 2014 guidelines came out, Allergan CEO Brent Saunders said that this seemed like the most plausible avenue of attack, and in the ""worst-case scenario"" it could hit the company's tax rate to the tune of 300 basis points, as Allergan (then called Actavis) was itself the product of a tax inversion and had a large U.S. presence.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan wrote that it's hard to tell how much tax Pfizer could save under current inversion rules, but the deal price now on the table would still yield accretion for Pfizer.""We modeled conservative tax benefits going forward with a 2017 anticipated tax rate of 22% subsequently dropping to 18% in 2019,"" Divan wrote in a research note. ""Our initial cost-synergy assumptions are also relatively conservative, with an assumption of $1.2 billion in cost synergies realized in 2019. It is possible Pfizer would be able to extract greater cost synergies from a deal, with each incremental $1 billion in synergies representing an additional 3 to 5 cents to yearly EPS from 2017 to 2019.""In midmorning trading on the stock market today, Allergan stock was down about 2.6% near 302.50, while Pfizer was down more than 3% near 32.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook.

624,PFE,"Pfizer (PFE) is near a massive deal to buy Allergan (AGN) and redomicile in Ireland, multiple reports said, even as the Treasury Department plans to impose new restrictions on tax inversions.Pfizer are discussing a deal that would pay $370-$380 a share for Botox maker Allergan, Bloomberg and Reuters reported late Wednesday. Allergan rose 4.5% to 310.83 on Wednesday, but retreated after hours following news of the inversion rules. Allergan traded as low as 237.50 on Oct. 21 before Pfizer-Allergan deal buzz picked up. Pfizer rose 1.3% to 33.31 on Wednesday, and was little changed late Wednesday.At $380 a share, it would be a $150 billion takeover, the largest health care deal ever and the biggest takeover of any kind this year.Bloomberg said the companies want to announce a deal as soon as Monday while Reuters said an announcement was not necessarily imminent. Both said that the Treasury's Wednesday announcement to issue ""targeted"" tax inversion guidance later this week could affect the timing of any agreement.By acquiring the Irish drugmaker, Pfizer would be able to limit its exposure to the punitive U.S. corporate tax system. America's corporate rates are the highest in the industrial world and the country taxes U.S. companies' overseas profits when they are repatriated.The Treasury issues restrictions on tax inversions in September 2014. That stopped an AbbVie (ABBV) acquisition, but deals involving Burger King (now Restaurant Brands (QSR), Medtronic (MDT) and Mylan (MYL) went ahead.It's unclear what new limits Treasury will impose, but the Obama administration can't ban inversions outright. In addition to the inversion benefits, Pfizer would beef up its brand-name drugs, and boost its pipeline of treatments in mid- or late-stage trials.Pfizer could use the Allergan deal to lead to a Pfizer breakup into two or three companies.Follow Ed Carson on Twitter @IBD_ECarson and on Facebook.

642,PFE,"""Later this week, we intend to issue additional targeted guidance to deter and reduce further the economic benefits of corporate inversions,"" Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said in a letter to four senior lawmakers. Further details were unavailable.
"
643,PFE,"""It is important to emphasize, however, that Treasury cannot stop inversions without new statutory authority,"" Lew said.

644,PFE,"Shares of Allergan (AGN), an Ireland-based drugmaker, had been mulling an inversion deal with Pfizer (PFE). Pfizer was little changed after hours.

649,PFE,"Big pharmas Merck (MRK), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) were trading up Tuesday after getting upgrades from Barclays, while AbbVie (ABBV) seesawed on a downgrade.Analyst Geoff Meacham assumed coverage of a newly combined U.S. Pharmaceuticals sector in Barclays' coverage, and while he left most ratings the same he made a few tweaks. Lilly was upgraded to overweight from equal weight, and its price target lifted to 95 from 75, based on the promising pipeline and management's commitment to lowering expenses. Meacham said that Lilly could be building a ""major autoimmune disease franchise"" with its late-stage drug candidates ixekizumab (for psoriasis) and baricitinib, a rheumatoid-arthritis drug it's developing with Incyte (INCY).""Based on the solid Phase 3 data, we view baricitinib as having significant market share potential in rheumatoid arthritis,"" Meacham wrote. ""Our model conservatively projects 2025 risk-adjusted sales of $1.2 billion vs. peak sales of $1.5 billion for (Pfizer 's (PFE) Xeljanz.""Meacham called diabetes drug Jardiance Lilly's ""most important commercial asset over the intermediate term"" since its recent study results showed it sharply reduced deaths from heart failure . He admitted that this has been an overhang for Merck, as it derives a lot of its revenue from competing drug Jardiance, but argued that the stock has overreacted.""While we acknowledge there are multiple headwinds and risks that make Merck a 'show me' story, we think even under most potential negative scenarios that there is too much underlying value to ignore,"" Meacham wrote as he raised Merck's rating to overweight from equal weight and hiked its price target to 66 from 65. ""Even if pipeline assets aren't blockbusters, they add up and are nearly free at the current valuation.""Lilly stock was up almost 5% near 86 in afternoon trading on the stock market today, while Merck stock was up 2% near 54.Meacham also raised J&J to overweight from equal weight, with the price target rising $14 to 155. As with Merck, he felt that the market is undervaluing J&J.""J&J has underperformed the S&P 500 and DRG over the past 12 months due to concerns about the impact of biosimilars on Remicade, low near-term earnings growth, and a lack of significant near-term pipeline catalysts,"" Meacham wrote. ""This has led to calls to break up the conglomerate, but we believe this to be premature.""In Meacham's view, J&J would be better off acquiring growth assets, especially in pharma.J&J stock was up 1% in afternoon trading, near 102.Meanwhile Meacham downgraded AbbVie to equal weight from overweight and trimmed the price target to 72 from 73. Like many analysts, he thought that AbbVie's projections for recently acquired blood-cancer drug Imbruvica and similar drugs in the pipeline — some $20 billion a year at peak — are too high.""Imbruvica and other oncology assets likely to succeed, but the field is highly competitive,"" Meacham wrote.AbbVie stock initially dropped almost 2% in Tuesday's trading, but by afternoon was up about 1.5% near 59.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook.

650,PFE,"Shares of biotech Aerie Pharmaceuticals (AERI) vaulted as much as 85% Thursday and got a passel of price target increases after the company announced late Wednesday that its glaucoma drug had succeeded in a late-stage clinical trial.
"
651,PFE,"Aerie said that its eye drop Rhopressa had succeeded in lowering intra-ocular pressure in sufferers from glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Its goal was to show that a once-daily dose of Rhopressa was non-inferior to timolol, a popular ingredient in eye drops such as Allergan's (AGN) Combigan and Merck's (MRK) Cosopt.
"
652,PFE,"Aerie also tested a twice-daily dose of Rhopressa, which it said was slightly more effective but also showed a higher rate of side effects. The most common side effect was eye redness, which appeared in 35% of all subjects on Rhopressa.
"
653,PFE,"Aerie said that it expects to file for FDA approval in mid-2016.
"
654,PFE,"Aerie stock jumped to a five-month high of 33.25 on the stock market today before closing up 67.11% at 30.08, making it among the market's top percentage gainers for the day.
"
655,PFE,"Big Drop In April
"
656,PFE,"The trial was one of two phase-three studies, called Rocket 1 and Rocket 2. Rocket 1 had failed to meet the non-inferiority endpoint, which whacked 64% off the stock price back in April. However, in June the FDA agreed to let Aerie modify the Rocket 2 endpoint by looking only at patients with relatively low levels of intra-ocular pressure to start with — below 26 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) — as this group had responded better in Rocket 1.
"
657,PFE,"This adjustment led to accusations that Aerie ""dredged Rocket 1 to make Rhopressa seem more efficacious,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Corey Davis acknowledged in his research note. However, ""since 75% of glaucoma patients have intra-ocular pressures less than 25 mmHg, we think Rhopressa, if approved, has a definitive place in the market."" Davis raised his price target on the stock to 44 from 18.
"
658,PFE,"RBC Capital Markets analyst Adnan Butt wrote that the results also bode well for Roclatan, a combination of Rhopressa with latanoprost, a prostaglandin analogue (PGA) sold separately by Pfizer (PFE) as Xalatan. Roclatan is also in phase-three testing, though earlier in the process.
"
659,PFE,"""Should Roclatan demonstrate superiority to its components .. . we believe there would be little to no controversy that Roclatan could be a blockbuster drug,"" Butt wrote, raising his price target to 44 from 31.
"
660,PFE,"Needham analyst Serge Belanger raised his price target to 45 from 27, noting that Rhopressa would be the first new glaucoma treatment in 20 years.

662,PFE,"Hillary Clinton has promoted her drug pricing plan as a way to take on an industry she says is guilty of ""outrageous"" prices. But it's her friends in the media who could take the hit.While Clinton's plan wouldn't go as far as some have suggested in banning consumer-directed drug advertising, she would, in effect, tax advertising dollars as if they were after-tax profits.The hope is that doing so would restrain unnecessary prescription drug spending because patients wouldn't ask their doctor if they should be trying out some wonder-cure they learned about on TV, or reading a newspaper.""This would ostensibly decrease pharma ad spending in order to make branded drugs less prevalent in the minds of consumers over cheaper generics,"" wrote Cowen & Co. health care analyst Charles Rhee.An even more certain result would be a hit to media-company profits — or an expansion of their losses.Last year, drugmakers spent $3.2 billion on TV ads, $1.2 billion on magazine ads and $127 million on newspaper ads, according to Kantar Media. Pfizer (PFE) spent more than $1 billion on ads, roughly the same as the combined total of the next three biggest advertisers AbbVie (ABBV), Eli Lilly (LLY) and AstraZeneca (AZN).Yet, Rhee wrote, ""even if the overall pie were to shrink, we think more of the ad pie would shift in favor of digital advertisers in an even accelerated manner as advertisers seek greater return on investment.""In particular, Rhee names WebMD (WBMD) and Everyday Health (EVDY) as potential winners in this scenario, though he sees it as unlikely to come to pass under a Republican-dominated Congress.Still, maybe there's hope that Hillary's plan would help her great friends in the blogosphere.

677,PFE,"The Doctor is 'NOT' in....  Just ask United Health Care's  (UNH) CEO - Stephen Helmsley........Obama care has made THEM sick and they are not willing to continue to suffer losses going into 2017........That's right 2017 - because yesterday the company announced a $700 mil loss in the exchange business for 2015 - which included an 'advance recognition of losses for 2016'.....this announcement caused them to cut 2015 earnings projections to $6/sh...down from $6.35/share.
"
678,PFE,"This announcement does NOT include an expected additional $225 mil in 2016 losses.......as a result - investors took 8% out of the stock at one point yesterday after they heard the news that ""the biggest US health insurer has suffered major losses on policies sold under the affordable care act's (ACA) exchanges and will consider withdrawing from them.....""

We as consumers are seeing the least desirable 'silver' plans increase rates by 7.5% on avg while the better plans are seeing increases of more than 10%, with higher deductibles and higher co-pays.........and just like ECON 101 taught you.....higher costs discourage buyers (in this case HEALTHY buyers) , which then only drives the costs even higher because the remaining consumers are sicker and need more healthcare....it's a vicious circle.....known as the 'death spiral'.....

I'm just sayin....) From a short term basis, the market is trying to work off last week’s sharp selloff and so far it appears to be doing just that......We need to continue to watch what crude oil prices do....Crude is now trading at $41/barrel....it needs to hold here....

We as consumers are seeing the least desirable 'silver' plans increase rates by 7.5% on avg while the better plans are seeing increases of more than 10%, with higher deductibles and higher co-pays.........and just like ECON 101 taught you.....higher costs discourage buyers (in this case HEALTHY buyers) , which then only drives the costs even higher because the remaining consumers are sicker and need more healthcare....it's a vicious circle.....known as the 'death spiral'.....Now Republicans were quick  to jump on the bandwagon saying that ""Premiums are up and healthcare is more expensive...the consequences we see from this hastily and conceived legislation were entirely foreseeable and not at all surprising"" .....and as you expected the Democrats - led by Obama were quick to point out that the 'law is working well'.......Hmmm.....Well boys....you can't have it both ways - so which is it....is the ACA  working or not?  By the sounds of it.....CEO Helmsley clearly has a view......maybe the Democrats  need to talk to the insurers and see why the Doctor is NOT in......And in another move by the healthcare industry.....yesterday brought us news that Pfizer (PFE) is pressing ahead in its fight to save on corporate taxes by getting in bed with Ireland based Allergan (AGN)......putting the gov't and the company on a 'collision course' in what is known as the 'inversion trade'.......and here the Democrats want to prevent a company from 'strategically relocating' to take advantage of a broken US corp tax structure by piling on more regulations and red tape  while the Republicans say that the real problem here is the ""Broken US Corp Tax Structure"" as they call for a complete overhaul of the tax code - thereby eliminating the need or incentive to invert....Now back to the mkts......the broader mkt showed a lack of direction yesterday after Wednesday's surge......causing the S&P to tease both sides of the unchanged at least 25 times....the lack of any real significant change came as traders/investor took a breath.  The technical underpinnings of the mkt continue to argue that only a few companies continue to dominate the major indexes, while so many continue to drag....While the biggest companies with the largest capitalizations have pushed the Dow, S&P and Nasdaq closer to their annual highs.....the broader indexes like the Wilshire 5000 and the Russell 2000 are still struggling.(The Wilshire 5000 - a total mkt index that measure the performance of all US stocks with 'readily available price data'.  But most people do not follow or even know what the Wilshire 5000 is.....because the media only talks about the Dow, the S&P and the Nasdaq, which are heavily weighted with large cap companies....that the average investors knows....  In fact the Wilshire 5000 is a much truer measure of the real health of the US economy as a whole.... I'm just sayin....) From a short term basis, the market is trying to work off last week’s sharp selloff and so far it appears to be doing just that......We need to continue to watch what crude oil prices do....Crude is now trading at $41/barrel....it needs to hold here.... A rally in oil will certainly help support the mkt but that is still a difficult call given the fundamentals and the strengthening dollar.....but it IS in a short-term oversold condition - so a bounce would not be out of the question......causing bargain hunters to go on a shopping spree.Overnight - the Asian mkts finished the week strong... Japan +0.1%, Hong Kong + 1.13%, China + 0.37% and ASX +0.26%. In Europe - mkts are churning.....even as Draghi hints at more stimulus......The Mali hostage crisis this morning is raising concerns over global security..... causing the focus to once again turn to ISIS and the recent events in France.  In the end - the mkts need to digest the action of late as we move into the weekend.  FTSE +0.12%, CAC 40 -0.13%, DAX +0.3%, EUROSTOXX -0.01%, SPAIN -0.5% AND ITALY -0.6%.  US Futures are pointing higher.....currently +5 pts.....but keeping us still within the 2065/2100 trading range.  We will get another load of FED speakers today.....St Louis FED Pres Bullard and NY's Dudley - both speaking on the economy......and you can believe that they will hammer home the message of 'normalization' coming to a theater near you in December.  On the eco front - look for reports form the Kansas City FED......survey says 0.  Take good care    KpKenny Polcari is Vice President and director of NYSE Floor Operations on behalf of O’Neil Securities, Inc., a sister company of Investor's Business Daily.

686,PFE,"Big biotech Amgen (AMGN) agreed to pay up to $1.55 billion for a Dutch biotech developing a new cholesterol drug, the company said Wednesday.
"
687,PFE,"Amgen will pay $300 million upfront for privately held Dezima, which has a midstage drug candidate called TA-8995 for lowering LDL cholesterol. If the drug succeeds, Amgen is on the hook for up to $1.25 billion in milestone payments. It will also pay an unspecified royalty to Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma, from which Dezima originally licensed the drug.
"
688,PFE,"TA-8995 is a cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor, a class of drug that Eli Lilly (LLY) and Merck (MRK) are also working on. Analysts have generally been cautious about these programs because two prior CETP drugs by Roche (RHHBY) and Pfizer (PFE) had failed in clinical trials, and in July RBC Capital Markets' cardiovascular expert sources applied only a 25% to 40% probability of success to Lilly's and Merck's programs. At the same time, however, Lilly said it had conducted a futility analysis of its phase-three trial and the results were encouraging enough to continue. Results are expected early next year.
"
689,PFE,"If the CETP inhibitors succeed, they could provide competition to Amgen's newly launched cholesterol drug Repatha, which is perhaps why Amgen decided to acquire one. In the company's press release, however, Amgen R&D chief Sean Harper suggested the two drugs could be complementary.
"
690,PFE,"""With a portfolio of TA-8995 and Repatha, our recently launched LDL-C lowering PCSK9 inhibitor, we will be able to offer more treatment options with different mechanisms of action and modes of administration across varying LDL-C levels and risk profiles,"" Harper said.
"
691,PFE,"The announcement came the same morning that Amgen announced a licensing deal with Xencor (XNCR) to develop new cancer and inflammation drugs using Xencor's bispecific antibody platform, as Amgen seeks to fill out its pipeline in the face of biosimilar competition to its older drugs.

737,PFE,"Big biotech Amgen beat Wall Street's Q3 estimates and offered mixed guidance late Wednesday, sending the stock up modestly in after-hours trading.
"
738,PFE,"Amgen (AMGN) reported adjusted earnings of $2.72 a share, up 18% from a year earlier and beating analysts' consensus by 34 cents, according to Thomson Reuters.
"
739,PFE,"Revenue climbed 14% to $5.72 billion, about $400 million above consensus and the best gain in several years.
"
740,PFE,"Amgen lifted its full-year guidance, though compared with the Q3 beat it implied that Q4 may underperform. It added $200 million to $300 million to its revenue guidance, now $21.4 billion to $21.6 billion. It raised its EPS guidance by about 35 cents, now $9.95 to $10.10. Both were above Wall Street's estimate.
"
741,PFE,"Amgen also provided preliminary 2016 guidance that was in line with revenue estimates but below consensus on EPS. Amgen guided sales of $21.7 billion to $22.3 billion and an EPS range of $10.35 to $10.75.
"
742,PFE,"RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee noted that issuing preliminary 2016 targets was ""a surprise move, perhaps implying management confidence on the business,"" as Amgen usually doesn't give such guidance until the Q4 report.

743,PFE,"Yee added that""our experience shows the company starts annual guidance conservatively and then raises through the year (they've done this for years now).""

744,PFE,"Enbrel Sales Unsustainable?
"
745,PFE,"About half of the revenue beat came from Amgen's top seller, rheumatoid-arthritis drug Enbrel, whose sales rose 30% over the year earlier to $1.46 billion vs. consensus of $1.23 billion. Amgen said its sales were ""driven by net selling price and low inventory levels in the prior year period, offset partially by the impact of competition.""
"
746,PFE,"Neulasta, its No. 2 drug, beat consensus by about $100 million but rose only 6% to $1.05 billion.
"
747,PFE,"Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum noted that Amgen indicated abnormally large purchases of Enbrel and Neulasta in Q3, which would explain why its guidance doesn't call for a continuation of the outperformance.
"
748,PFE,"""(The Enbrel beat was) driven mostly by price increases while the product continued to lose share in a growing market — units were up 3% quarter over quarter, but share declined,"" he wrote in an email to clients.

754,PFE,"Stocks traded a bit lower yesterday - after Wednesday's FED induced rally.....as traders considered the language and odds of a December rate hike.  Selling was subdued, there was no ""get me outta here"" tone to the action at all.
"
755,PFE,"The mkt paused really - as investors now thought about the latest GDP report - which came in at +1.5%.....(great because it is positive) but when compared to the 2nd qtr it looks a bit pale.....yesterday's report was more a 60% drop from qtr to qtr all at a time when the FED suggests the economy is poised to 'explode' and that 'rates will rise in December'.
"
756,PFE,"In addition - yesterday's report was a disappointment when you consider year over year growth......last year's 3rd qtr growth rate was 2% - so all this says is that the economy continues to be held hostage to the dynamics of  weakness at home and abroad.   As the journal points out the ""US Economy Slogs Through Soft Patch"" -  consumer spending, business spending and home building all contributing to our positive report all in the face of 'headwinds' abroad.
"
757,PFE,"But do not be blindsided....Consumer spending  is misleading...because it includes what 'consumers spend' on healthcare - which is not something that many people consider they read the story about the health of the consumer......Spending by consumers on healthcare represents 30% of GDP...or some $18 bil ...but the gov't includes this under the heading of 'consumer spending' - making it appear as if the consumer spending is stronger than what reality might prove otherwise.   Remember - spending on healthcare is not really an option for the family budget - so that gets filed under the 'must pay' budget line.....which means that 'discretionary spending' gets cut back.....it's all semantics really....as far as Obama is concerned - Consumer spending - no matter on what - is still consumer spending....So - It's all good!
"
758,PFE,"Now in other news......our broken corporate tax structure has created another opportunity for a huge merger between Pfizer (PFE) and Allergan (AGN)  as they consider 'hooking up'  to avoid US taxes...you see - Allergan is based in Ireland and Ireland is a bit friendlier to big corporations......so if Pfizer gets into bed with Allergan in Ireland - they cut their US corporate tax liability in what is known as the 'inversion trade'...... Where one US company buys a smaller foreign rival and then moves the corporate headquarters abroad and BOOM!  - they just cut their US tax obligation by millions of dollars....   And to make the point - PFE CEO - Ian Read made no bones about it.....saying that ""US Corporate tax rates have put the company at a disadvantage to its foreign rivals.....We are fighting with one hand tied behind our back.....and that Pfizer was doing what we need to do to ensure that we can continue to innovate.""
"
759,PFE,"When will Washington wake up?  How many more 'inversion trades' must we see before those Bozo's in Congress recognize that they are nothing but a bunch of clowns as evidenced by the new 2 yr budget deal that lifts the debt ceiling even higher and rolls back fiscal austerity...but hey - it removes the risk of a debt limit/default risk for another  2 yrs....so the mkt will embrace that.
"
760,PFE,"And the 'other pharma' story continues to keep us glued to our seats....Valeant Pharma  (VRX) continues to make headlines......CVS Health Corp. (CVS), Express Scripts  (ESRX) and United Health  are all cutting ties with Philidor Rx - the pharmacy that has helped to propel VRX  to international fame.....The stock closed down $5 pts and is now down another 6 pts in early pre-mkt trading.  Remember that old quote - 'Where there's smoke, there's fire..'.....The question now is - is the fire just a log or the whole house?
"
761,PFE,"US futures are up 2 pts - Global mkts are under a bit of pressure.   The BoJ (Bank of Japan) did not increase their QE program which caught some by surprise but did not cause a negative mkt reaction.   In Europe  - EU eco data was mixed....CPI did rise by 1%, while German retail sales missed the expectation.  Inflation figures were better, but still low and will have no impact on the ECB's plan for more stimulus. 
"
762,PFE,"It is the last day of the month - so we will sure have some 'window dressing  or undressing' taking place  as asset managers close their books on October.   Earnings continue to weigh on some stocks, but overall the season is not as bad as originally expected....so the nervousness that permeated the mkts in early October seemed to have subsided.   Expect to see the mkt challenge 2100 today.....and then back off and churn in line....Eco data today  could derail us - but I doubt it.  Pers Income of +0.2%, Pers Spend of +0.2%, ISM Milwaukee of 44 and Chicago Purch Manager of 49.4.

766,PFE,"Drug giant Pfizer (PFE) is in buying range after getting a boost from a better-than-expected quarterly earnings report. The maker of blockbuster drugs such as Viagra and cholesterol fighter Lipitor broke out past a 35.63 buy point of a flat base in heavy volume on Wednesday. It remains within the 5% limit that defines a buy range. 
"
767,PFE,"A day earlier, the New York City-based company reported that Q2 earnings dipped 3% to 56 cents a share due to a strong dollar and patent expirations.

775,PFE,"Canadian specialty-drug giant Valeant Pharmaceuticals International agreed to pay $1 billion for Sprout Pharmaceuticals Thursday, two days after Sprout's much-debated female aphrodisiac Addyi received FDA approval.
"
776,PFE,"The market seemed unimpressed by the move, as Valeant (VRX) stock fell 6.5% Thursday, to a six-week low of 229.06. A top-performing stock in recent years, Valeant shares touched a record high near 264 on Aug. 6.
"
777,PFE,"Valeant agreed to pay $500 million upfront and another $500 million in the first quarter of next year, ""plus a share of future profits based upon the achievement of certain milestones,"" according to the company's press release.
"
778,PFE,"Valeant expects the deal to have no impact on 2015 earnings and be modestly accretive in 2016.
"
779,PFE,"Addyi, also known by its generic name flibanserin, has often been compared with Pfizer's (PFE) blockbuster Viagra in the press. But whereas Viagra affects only the physics of impotence, Addyi treats hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), or low libido.
"
780,PFE,"Third Time's A Charm
"
781,PFE,"The FDA rejected the drug twice before finally approving it Tuesday with fairly heavy safety restrictions, as the drug can cause dizziness, nausea and fainting, especially when combined with alcohol. Physicians prescribing Addyi and pharmacies selling it must be certified under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program and counsel patients on the risks.
"
782,PFE,"Nonetheless, Addyi is the first and only drug treating HSDD on the market, and the massive social-media campaign that backed its approval indicates a substantial demand for some kind of libido drug.
"
783,PFE,"""Delivering a first-ever treatment for a commonly reported form of female sexual dysfunction gives us the perfect opportunity to establish a new portfolio of important medications that uniquely impact women,"" Valeant CEO J. Michael Pearson said in a statement.
"
784,PFE,"""We applaud the efforts of the Sprout team to address this important area of unmet need and look forward to working with them to bring the benefits of Addyi to additional markets around the world,"" he said.
"
785,PFE,"Women's health hasn't been a traditional focus for Valeant, whose largest product lines are in dermatology and opthalmology, including the giant Bausch & Lomb contact-lens brand.
"
786,PFE,"But BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei sees it as fitting in with ""Valeant's strategic focus on aesthetic-like markets with limited big-pharma competition.""
"
787,PFE,"He wrote in a research note that although Valeant's management expects to hire 150 to 200 sales reps for Addyi, which is expected to launch in mid-October, Valeant shouldn't have to spend much compared to the possible income.
"
788,PFE,"""Management believes female HSDD could be a very large market, potentially similar in size to the $5 billion male erectile dysfunction (ED) market,"" Arfaei said in his note Thursday.
"
789,PFE,"""Moreover, management believes that there is significant pent-up demand, so with a salesforce that could be up and running by the end of the year, sales could ramp up quickly.
"
790,PFE,"""However, we believe that uptake will be significantly lower than in ED, given the safety issues with the product.""
"
791,PFE,"Priced At $400 A Month
"
792,PFE,"Another difference between Addyi and the ED drugs is that Addyi has to be taken constantly instead of before a specific sex act. The maintenance dose has been priced at $400 a month, which Sprout says is on par with ED drug spending.
"
793,PFE,"Insurers, though, are still working out whether and how they will cover the product. Not all insurers cover sexual-performance treatments.
"
794,PFE,"Anthem (ANTM) has put Addyi on its third tier, as it has put Viagra and Eli Lilly's (LLY) Cialis, offering some reimbursement but not as much as its preferred drugs.
"
795,PFE,"Other insurers and pharmacy benefit managers have said that they're still thinking about it.
"
796,PFE,"""The high level of uncertainty around this product seems like an area (Valeant) management generally tries to avoid,"" wrote Morningstar analyst Michael Waterhouse in a research note.
"
797,PFE,"""Additionally, the likelihood of no insurance coverage could also suppress customer willingness to pay out-of-pocket,"" he said, ""but the drug's avoidance of reimbursement does fit nicely with Valeant's preference for cash-pay products.""Canadian specialty-drug giant Valeant Pharmaceuticals International agreed to pay $1 billion for Sprout Pharmaceuticals Thursday, two days after Sprout's much-debated female aphrodisiac Addyi received FDA approval.The market seemed unimpressed by the move, as Valeant (VRX) stock fell 6.5% Thursday, to a six-week low of 229.06.

821,PFE,"The major index ETFs downshifted further Monday, as China and the Federal Reserve have continued to weigh on the stock market. On the last trading day of August, exchange traded funds tracking the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq 100 posted their largest monthly losses since 2012. Last week, turbulence in the stock market whipsawed investors even as it intensified worries about a global slowdown and raised doubts about the wisdom of a Fed rate hike next month.SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) slipped 0.7% on the stock market today.The ETF holds 30 blue-chip industrial leaders.Merck (MRK), Pfizer (PFE) and IBD Leaderboard stock Visa (V) were among DIA's lead decliners.No. 1 holding Goldman Sachs (GS) and Intel (INTC) were among only six stocks in DIA that advanced.DIA pegged a 6% decline for August, its worst monthly loss in 3 years.So did SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), a proxy for the broad market, and PowerShares QQQ (QQQ), which tracks the 100 largest nonfinancial stocks in the Nasdaq Composite Index.SPY fell 0.9% Monday, with every sector besides energy in the red. QQQ gave up 1.2%.Among QQQ's top 25 holdings, biotech stocks Gilead Sciences (GILD), Amgen (AMGN), Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN) were among the hardest hit at Monday's close. They lost 2% to 4% each.IShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) took a 3.2% hit and Market Vectors Biotechnology (BBH) 3.3%, the worst among sector- and industry-focused ETFs.The so-called ""death cross"" on SPY's daily chart is its first appearance in four years. The pattern occurs when a short-term moving average, like the 10-week moving average, slips below a long-term line like the 40-week moving average. It's seen as a bearish signal, warning of loss of momentum and more losses ahead.According to market watchers interviewed by CNBC, crosses on the daily chart may be less relevant than longer-term crosses.It may be more worrisome, therefore, that the weekly charts for SPY and DIA also show this pattern.Here's a look at how benchmark exchange traded funds tracking various asset classes are performing today.Following daily ETF market action can be key to successful investing:10 Bellwether ETFs: SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), +0.1%, RS 54 IShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond (AGG), -0.1%, RS 70 PowerShares DB US$ Bullish (UUP), -0.2%, RS 80 Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO), -0.2%, RS 25 IShares Russell 2000 (IWM), -0.4%, RS 61 SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA), -0.7%, RS 51 IShares Core S&P Mid-Cap (IJH), -0.7%, RS 61 IShares MSCI EAFE (EFA), -0.8%, RS 47 SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), -0.9%, RS 61 PowerShares QQQ (QQQ), -1.2%, RS 70Follow Aparna Narayanan on Twitter: @IBD_ANarayanan.

"
823,PFE,"Some dividend ETFs focusing on high yield come with a downside: risky stocks. Not Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity (SCHD), a $2.71 billion exchange traded fund that yields 3.2%.
"
824,PFE,"SCHD is a suitable core ETF for income investors. It delivers a higher yield than the S&P 500 without sacrificing quality, says Morningstar analyst Michael Rawson.
"
825,PFE,"The ETF holds 99 high-yielding stocks while tending to winnow out distressed companies.
"
826,PFE,"It does that by requiring stock holdings to have 10 straight years of dividend payments and to rate highly on corporate fundamentals such as return on equity and cash-flow-to-debt ratio.
"
827,PFE,"""This tilts the fund toward quality companies like Pfizer (PFE), Microsoft (MSFT) and Procter & Gamble (PG),"" Rawson wrote recently. ""A further tilt toward quality results from the fund's use of market-cap weighting, which favors large-cap companies rather than more volatile but high-yielding mid-cap companies.""
"
828,PFE,"However, the dividend-payout rule shuts out newer dividend players such as Apple (AAPL) and Dunkin' Brands (DNKN).
"
829,PFE,"SCHD has an 0.07% expense ratio, or $7 in annual fees for every $10,000 invested.
"
830,PFE,"That makes it the cheapest ETF in the dividend stock category.

832,PFE,"Still, the fund's focus on high-quality stocks at the lowest cost has made it a winner for successful investing.

833,PFE,"SCHD produced an annual average gain of 13.7% over the past three years vs. 12.2% for Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG).
"
834,PFE,"VIG is the largest dividend ETF (without a currency hedge), with $19.48 billion in assets. It focuses on dividend growth rather than dividend yield, requiring holdings to have 10 consecutive years of dividend increases.

"
836,PFE,"Exchange traded funds holding dividend stocks tend to have a value skew. They have struggled to find their way into investors' ETF strategies for much of 2015 as growth stocks outperformed. Several of the largest dividend ETFs saw net outflow over the first nine months of 2015.

871,PFE,"Halozyme Therapeutics has been one of 2015's hotter biotech stocks, but it's not exactly because of developing a drug. Halozyme's (HALO) one marketed product, Hylenex, aids in the delivery of injectable drugs.
"
872,PFE,"Halozyme has also licensed Enhanze for the same purpose to such drug companies as Pfizer (PFE), Roche (RHHBY), Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Janssen division, AbbVie (ABBV) and Baxalta (BXLT) for the development of injectable products.
"
873,PFE,"San Diego-based Halozyme is also testing a product called PEGPH20 in combination with other drugs as a treatment for various cancers.
"
874,PFE,"Analysts don't expect these efforts to yield steady annual earnings until 2017, but even after the recent biotech stock selloff, Halozyme is trading at double where it was at the start of the year.
"
875,PFE,"In a recent interview with IBD, Halozyme CEO Helen Torley explained the company's business model and why it's catching Wall Street's attention.
"
876,PFE,"IBD: You have two drug-delivery products, Hylenex and Enhanze, that seem similar. What is the difference between them?
"
877,PFE,"Torley: Our one marketed product is Hylenex, and that is the basic rHuPH20 enzyme which degrades hyaluronan, which is a sugar that is present under your skin. If you've ever had a subcutaneous injection, as they're injecting it you probably get sore because they're coming up against some resistance. That resistance is caused by the hyaluronan that's under the skin.
"
878,PFE,"Our product, which is rHuPH20, in Hylenex and also in Enhanze, temporarily breaks down the hyaluronan, which releases the water molecules that are attached to the hyaluronan, and allows the creation of passages underneath the skin that allow whatever you're injecting there to have a bigger surface area for absorption into the bloodstream or the lymphatics.
"
879,PFE,"Hylenex is the product that Halozyme went and got approved, and it's promoted by a small field force that we have in the U.S.
"
880,PFE,"It basically is the rHuPH20 that is used for the dispersion of fluids that can be given under the skin and also with some drugs as well. That is a modest part of our business in terms of generating some revenue.
"
881,PFE,"Now we also have the part of the business that we call the Enhanze platform. And that's where we allow partners like Pfizer, Roche, Janssen, AbbVie and Baxalta to license the use of our enzyme, which, in most of those cases, they combine with their molecule.
"
882,PFE,"I'll use Roche's Herceptin and MabThera (Rituxan in the U.S.) as two examples. They created a new product that was a mixture of Herceptin and our enzyme, and went through a different regulatory path to get approved. So when that new product, which is called Herceptin SC, is injected, our enzyme works to allow the herceptin to be absorbed underneath the skin because it's breaking down that hyaluronan barrier and allowing there to be a bigger surface area for absorption. So instead of Herceptin having to be given into the vein, as an IV, when it's co-administered with our drug you can give it as a subcutaneous injection.
"
883,PFE,"It's the same base sugar. It's just that when it's licensed, it's called Enhanze, and when it's our product, it's called Hylenex.
"
884,PFE,"IBD: And the drug you're developing for cancer treatment is also based on the same substance?
"
885,PFE,"Torley: When we give Hylenex in the marketplace today, we give it subcutaneously. If we were to give it into the vein, it would be digested in the liver very rapidly. So it wouldn't have a big effect if it were given into the vein.
"
886,PFE,"(So) we pegylated it. (Pegylating) is a not-uncommon approach taken to have drugs have a longer time that they can circulate in your body before they get digested and degraded by the liver. The PEGPH20 is basically a pegylated version of the rHuPH20 enzyme. We can give it into the vein and it will last in the body for several days, so it can exert its effects for several days.
"
887,PFE,"Some examples would be Amgen's (AMGN) Neupogen, which is given pretty frequently for patients who have low white (blood) cells from receiving chemotherapy. They peglyated it and created Neulasta, which only had to be injected every couple of weeks, which was obviously a better convenience for patients.
"
888,PFE,"That's exactly what we're trying to do here: have the drug last longer so it doesn't have to be given as frequently.
"
889,PFE,"IBD: So is it necessarily combined with another drug, or does it do anything by itself?
"
890,PFE,"Torley: PEGPH20 has some modest anti-cancer effect. But for the type of effects that we believe are important for patients, it needs to be used with another therapy.
"
891,PFE,"I'll give an example of the data we just presented in late May, a study of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. These are patients who generally have a life expectancy of about six months after they're diagnosed.
"
892,PFE,"We are looking at PEGPH20 in addition to one of the current best-available therapies, which is a combination of Abraxane, Celgene's (CELG) drug, and gemcitabine, which is a generic drug. What we did was look at PEGPH20 on top of Abraxane and gemcitabine vs. Abraxane and gemcitabine alone.
"
893,PFE,"The theory as to why PEGPH20 is working is that for patients who are at a high level of this sugar hyaluronan in and around their tumor, it acts as a barrier to the cancer therapies' ability to get to the tumor where they need to work. And it does that by binding water molecules, creating high pressure in and around the tumor that compresses the blood vessels, so that when you get an injection of Abraxane, for example, the theory is the Abraxane cannot get into the tumor where it needs to work because there's low blood flow in the tumor.
"
894,PFE,"We administer our PEG0H20, it breaks down the hyaluronan, opens up the blood vessels, opens up the blood flow. And so if after you give PEGPH20 you give Abraxane and gemcitabine, there's a much higher concentration of the chemotherapies that get into the tumor where they need to work.
"
895,PFE,"Early data from our phase two study (showed) patients who received PEGPH20 before they got the gemcitabine and Abraxane had a doubling of their progression-free survival (and) a doubling of their response rate, and we saw an interesting early trend toward an improvement in survival — in the patients who had high levels of hyaluronan. (We) estimate that about 40% to 60% of pancreatic-cancer patients have high levels of this sugar.
"
896,PFE,"Today with Abraxane and gemcitabine, which is one of the best standards of care, the median survival is just about eight months. What we're hoping to do for these patients of high levels of hyaluronan is to get a good improvement over and above that.

924,PFE,"""On efficacy, these results are positive for baricitinib, but we think these efficacy results were consistent with data from Pfizer's JAK inhibitor Xeljanz at the high (unapproved) dose of 10 mg twice daily and thus largely expected. (Xeljanz 10 mg twice daily was not approved due to questions about the risk-benefit profile at that dose.) On safety in the trial, the press release reports that serious adverse events for baricitinib were similar to placebo although lower for Humira,"" Schoenebaum wrote in an email to clients. ""Therefore, although interested in the detailed efficacy data, we are particularly interested in the detailed safety data from the trial and also long-term safety, which we believe would be a major driver of uptake for chronic therapy in RA.""
"
925,PFE,"AbbVie's Humira is one of the world's best-selling drugs, pulling in some $12.5 billion last year, while Xeljanz, launched in 2013, has yet to crack $1 billion mark, even though it has the advantage of being a pill while Humira has to be injected.

928,PFE,"Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook.Big pharma Eli Lilly (LLY) and its biotech partner Incyte (INCY) said Wednesday that their rheumatoid-arthritis drug outperformed AbbVie's (ABBV) market-leading Humira in a clinical trial, sending both stocks higher.The study's primary endpoint for the drug baricitinib was simply to do better than the placebo as measured on the ACR20 test, which signifies at least a 20% improvement in symptoms. But the drug also outperformed Humira, both on the ARC20 and Disease Activity Score 28 tests after 12 weeks of treatment, and after 24 weeks beat Humira in a measure of joint damage. Lilly and Incyte did not give exact numbers but said detailed data will come in future medical meetings and publications.This was the fourth successful late-stage clinical trial for the drug, which is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, a class including Incyte's already marketed cancer drug Jakafi, as well as Pfizer's (PFE) rheumatoid-arthritis drug Xeljanz.

""Our recent financial results continue to demonstrate the power of our stand-alone platform, with double-digit growth in our legacy business, as well as enhanced double-digit growth from the EPD business.""
"
952,PFE,"Mylan shareholders seemed to agree, as its stock rose 12.9% to close at 48.78. Perrigo stock fell 6.2% to 146.90, but its management claimed victory.
"
953,PFE,"""We have said all along that this offer from Mylan was a bad deal for our shareholders, as it significantly undervalued our durable business model and industry-leading future growth prospects,"" Perrigo CEO Joseph Papa said in a statement. ""Strong organic growth, a disciplined approach to M&A and transparent, accessible corporate governance policies are the foundation of our successful business strategy.""
"
954,PFE,"Mylan first proposed buying Perrigo back in April for $60 in cash plus 2.2 Mylan shares for each Perrigo share, which it later lifted to $75 a share plus 2.3 Mylan shares — at the time, about $36 billion.
"
955,PFE,"By the time Mylan launched its tender offer on Sept. 14, the stock portion of that offer had lost considerable value, a result of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) abandoning its own hostile bid for Mylan to buy the generics business of Allergan (AGN) and also from the general drug-stock sell-off. Perrigo's stock has fallen also, however, leading Mylan to argue that Perrigo shareholders could still make money off a deal.
"
956,PFE,"Perrigo's leadership has steadfastly opposed Mylan's overtures, criticizing the offer, Mylan's business and Mylan's corporate governance. At the same time, they've sought to mollify shareholders with operational improvements and a $2 billion share buyback plan, the latter of which Papa said Friday would go ahead now that the vote is over.
"
957,PFE,"According to anonymously sourced reports, Perrigo's buyout prospects were also on hold until the Mylan issue was resolved. The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that during the summer, Perrigo was in talks with Endo International (ENDP) about a possible combination.

981,PFE,"Pharma giant Pfizer (PFE) was up 2.5% midday Tuesday after it reported earnings excluding one-time items of 60 cents a share, up 5% from the year-earlier quarter and beating consensus by 9 cents. Revenue shrank 2% to $12.1 billion but beat views by about $500 million.
"
982,PFE,"Pfizer added $1 billion to its full-year revenue guidance, now $47.5 billion to $48.5 billion vs. $49.6 billion last year. Its EPS guidance range is now $2.16 to $2.20, up about a dime from previous guidance though down a few cents from last year. Both numbers are above current analyst consensus.
"
983,PFE,"The results included 27 days of business from Hospira, the generic drugmaker Pfizer acquired for $17 billion on Sept. 3, bringing $330 million in revenue. Pfizer also noted in its earnings release that excluding the foreign-exchange impact, revenue rose 4%. The company credited pneumonia vaccine Prevnar 13, which was recently approved for adults and is enjoying ""increased demand in preparation for the upcoming flu season,"" according to the press release. Ibrance, a breast-cancer drug launched in the U.S. in February, took in $230 million, beating consensus by $35 million.

"
1034,PFE,"But the reality is it would raise premiums and modestly reduce the ranks of the insured, partly by pushing some small businesses to drop coverage. And, believe it or not, it's exactly what drug companies want.
"
1035,PFE,"As an example of how her plan would work, Clinton's presidential campaign points to Covered California. Starting in 2016, the state's ObamaCare insurance exchange will cap an individual's cost for any single covered drug at $250 a month under benchmark silver-level plans.
"
1036,PFE,"By itself, the California plan could raise premiums by up to 3% over three years, state officials have acknowledged. But Clinton's plan would go further by capping a consumer's total out-of-pocket cost for one or more drugs at $250 a month, not the cost for a single drug.

A number of states have enacted such limits in the past couple of years, including Montana, Delaware, Maryland, Louisiana and Maine.Meanwhile, the insurance industry has been firmly against the idea and warns that caps at low levels without controls on drug prices will raise premiums.Clinton wants to rein in drug prices, too, but analysts were highly skeptical that her proposals to allow imports of prescription drugs and let Medicare negotiate drug prices could get enough support in Congress. Republicans have opposed those ideas as discouraging innovative cures.

1134,PFE,"Four big drug companies gave mixed fourth-quarter reports and guidance Tuesday as patent losses and foreign-exchange rates clouded the near-term future, while gene-sequencer Illumina posted better-than-expected earnings.After the close, Amgen (AMGN) said its Q4 earnings rose 19% to $2.16 a share, beating consensus by 11 cents. Revenue for the big biotech rose 6% to $5.33 billion, more than $100 million above views.The company affirmed 2015 guidance of single-digit sales and profit growth it issued in October, and its stock was up nearly 1% after hours.Also after the close, Illumina (ILMN) reported profit of 87 cents a share, up 93% from the year-earlier quarter and 9 cents ahead of estimates. It also affirmed previous guidance. The company preannounced Q4 sales of $512 million, up 32%, earlier this month.The other three companies reported before the open.Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) said its Q4 profit excluding one-time items was 46 cents a share, down 10% but 5 cents above analysts' consensus, according to Thomson Reuters. Sales fell 4% to $4.26 billion, beating views by $200 million.For the year, earnings rose 2% to $1.85 a share, with sales slipping 3% to $15.9 billion.The company guided 2015 EPS in the range of $1.55 to $1.70, missing the Street's estimate of $1.71. Sales guidance of $14 billion to $15 billion also missed.On a conference call with analysts, executives said the impact of the strong dollar shaved $800 million off the 2015 guidance and 12 to 14 cents off EPS guidance. A strong dollar makes U.S. exports more expensive and less competitive, and it shrinks profit on sales that American companies make in euros and other denominations when the firms bring that money back home.Morningstar analyst Damien Conover wrote in a research note that while patent losses will continue to depress operating results this year, he's bullish on Bristol's immuno-oncology pipeline, starting with the recently approved Opdivo.

Analysts had expected $2.17 and $45.6 billion.In a statement, CFO Frank D'Amelio said the revenue guidance ""reflects the anticipated negative impact of $3.5 billion due to recent and expected product losses of exclusivity, as well as $2.8 billion as a result of recent adverse changes in essentially all foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar.""S&P Capital IQ analyst Jeffrey Loo lowered his rating on Pfizer to hold from buy. BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said the guidance ""underscores the company's need for a deal"" after its failure to buy AstraZeneca (AZN) last year.On Pfizer's call, CEO Ian Read declined to comment on rumors that Pfizer has been rebuffed by other large targets, but said, ""I don't feel that we need to do a large deal.""Pfizer's stock fell a fraction.Novartis (NVS) had a softer Q4 than the other two, but its stock rose 2.5% as it gave a more encouraging forecast for operating growth.Novartis' Q4 sales declined 2% to $14.6 billion, missing the Street's estimate of $14.7 billion. Earnings rose 3% to $1.21 a share, in line.Full-year sales rose 1% to $58 billion while EPS rose 4% to $5.23.The company said FX should shave 12% off 2015 income, but on a constant-currency basis, sales this year should rise in the midsingle digits while earnings should increase in the high single digits.""Following the corporate restructuring ... we expect Novartis will post stronger margins and have the scale to be in a stronger competitive position with its remaining business lines of drugs, eye-care products and generics,"" Conover wrote in a note Tuesday.

1147,PFE,"Pumped up by a strengthening U.S. and collapsing crude oil prices and weaker economies overseas, the dollar is flexing its muscles, resulting in weaker earnings and guidance for companies with international exposure.
"
1148,PFE,"Procter & Gamble (PG) said Tuesday its outlook for the entire year will be clouded by foreign exchange, which the company expects to reduce annual sales by 5% and net earnings by 12%.The Cincinnati-based consumer goods giant gets two-thirds of its revenue from outside America. When the dollar is strong, U.S. exports are more expensive and overseas sales translate into fewer greenbacks. P&G shares fell 3.4% Tuesday.Pfizer (PFE) in part blamed the stronger dollar for its sullen 2015 forecast. The largest U.S. drugmaker expects full-year adjusted earnings of $2 to $2.10, or 5% less than analysts thought. It sees sales of about $45.5 billion, slightly less than Wall Street views. Its shares fell 0.6% Tuesday, less than the general market.Other drug companies also are absorbing forex hits. Basel-based Novartis (NVS) is wrestling with a strong dollar and a Swiss franc that shot up this month after its currency cap was lifted.Buoyed by increasing consumer confidence and lower gasoline prices, the U.S. economy has been outperforming the rest of the world as Europe copes with deflation, Japan and Brazil endure recessions, China grows at a slower clip and Russia's petro-economy faces cheap oil and Western sanctions over Ukraine.As a result, the dollar rose 5% vs. major trading partners in Q4, the biggest gain since Q4 2008, when the global financial crisis spurred a brief stampede into dollar-denominated assets. As of Jan. 23, that dollar index in 2015 was a whopping 10% higher than Q4's average, turbocharged by central bank easings around the world.The ruble has lost half its value against the dollar in the past year. The yen lost about 15%, the euro 18.5% and the British pound 11.7%. The Chinese yuan, loosely pegged to the dollar, flattened last year after gaining strength slowly in recent years.Some analysts see cause for optimism, especially given oil prices' dramatic fall.""There is a question of (cheaper) energy being a windfall ... for consumers worldwide and with a weakening eurozone currency, does that bode well for S&P (500) profits?"" said Robert Keiser, vice president at S&P Capital IQ. ""In theory, yes. In theory, the global macroeconomic outlook is improving.""But in reality, his theory hasn't caught up yet to many U.S. companies reliant on overseas sales.The dollar will be ""a substantial headwind for us in 2015,"" DuPont (DD) CFO Nick Fanandakis said in a Tuesday conference call. He figures that forex will take 60 cents, or 12.7%, off his profit estimate to about $4.10 per share this year. Analysts expected $4.46. Shares fell 1.3%.Like Pfizer and Novartis, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) expects foreign exchange rates to cut 2015 revenue by $800 million and EPS by 12-14 cents. Bristol guided full-year sales to $14 billion to $15 billion and EPS to $1.55 to $1.70. Shares fell 0.8% Tuesday.It's hard to measure the dollar's impact on the overall S&P 500 — whose large-cap companies tend to have heavy overseas exposure — because the handling and accounting of foreign revenue vary from firm to firm.It's easier to analyze the effect of collapsing oil prices on corporate America: Q4 S&P 500 earnings are on track to rise 3.3%, but would be up nearly 7% excluding the energy sector, said Gregory Harrison, a senior analyst at Thomson Reuters.

""They were looking for new areas of business.""Pfizer (PFE), Valeant (VRX) and AbbVie (ABBV) all abandoned their attempted acquisitions of foreign targets, including AstraZeneca (AZN), but have turned their eyes toward acquiring domestic companies. Just Thursday, Pfizer said it was asked by the Federal Trade Commission for more information about its proposed merger with Hospira (HSP).

1234,PFE,"Big pharma Pfizer agreed to buy specialty generics firm Hospira Thursday in a $17 billion deal, sending Hospira's stock up 35% to a record high before easing slightly to close at 87.64.
"
1235,PFE,"Pfizer (PFE) agreed to pay $90 a share in cash for Hospira (HSP), which sells generic injectables and the devices to administer them. Pfizer said the buy should add 10 to 12 cents to EPS in the first year after the deal closes, expected in the second half.
"
1236,PFE,"Hospira will be folded into Pfizer's Global Established Pharmaceutical (GEP) unit, one of its three major divisions and one widely expected by Wall Street to be spun off someday.

1238,PFE,"The GEP business has been a drag, with revenue in the most recently reported quarter falling 11% from a year before. The Hospira buyout brings Pfizer further into the more lucrative realm of hard-to-make specialty products.

"
1240,PFE,"""Within the generics market, the limited number of players offering injectable products has led to stronger pricing power and better returns than the typical small-molecule generic market,"" wrote Morningstar analyst Damien Conover.
"
1241,PFE,"The purchase also brings Pfizer a portfolio of biosimilar products, knockoffs of the biologic drugs that have increasingly filled the ranks of top-selling products. Hospira recently launched a biosimilar version of Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) blockbuster immunology drug Remicade. Its biosimilar version of Amgen's (AMGN) Epogen may become the first biosimilar on the market in the U.S .
"
1242,PFE,"Hospira's earnings growth has accelerated the last three reported quarters, helping give it an excellent IBD Composite Rating of 97, but that was expected to end as it recently lost patent protection on its one branded drug, Precedex. S&P Capital IQ analyst Jeffrey Loo wrote that he thought Pfizer's offer ""significantly overvalued"" Hospira given its growth outlook.
"
1243,PFE,"Despite that, Pfizer's stock rose 2.9% Thursday to 32.99. Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez wrote in a research note that the stock could be up because the deal will further enable the spinoff of the GEP business.
"
1244,PFE,"It might also be up because many on the Street were rooting for a good buyout. After Pfizer's Q4 report last week, some analysts sounded frustrated that CEO Ian Read kept saying that a big deal wasn't necessary for Pfizer's growth strategy even though the company had bid more than $100 billion to try to buy AstraZeneca (AZN) last year.

1342,PFE,"Procter & Gamble (PG) said Tuesday its outlook for the entire year will be clouded by foreign exchange, which the company expects to reduce annual sales by 5% and net earnings by 12%.The Cincinnati-based consumer goods giant gets two-thirds of its revenue from outside America. When the dollar is strong, U.S. exports are more expensive and overseas sales translate into fewer greenbacks. P&G shares fell 3.4% Tuesday.Pfizer (PFE) in part blamed the stronger dollar for its sullen 2015 forecast. The largest U.S. drugmaker expects full-year adjusted earnings of $2 to $2.10, or 5% less than analysts thought. It sees sales of about $45.5 billion, slightly less than Wall Street views. Its shares fell 0.6% Tuesday, less than the general market.Other drug companies also are absorbing forex hits. Basel-based Novartis (NVS) is wrestling with a strong dollar and a Swiss franc that shot up this month after its currency cap was lifted.Buoyed by increasing consumer confidence and lower gasoline prices, the U.S. economy has been outperforming the rest of the world as Europe copes with deflation, Japan and Brazil endure recessions, China grows at a slower clip and Russia's petro-economy faces cheap oil and Western sanctions over Ukraine.As a result, the dollar rose 5% vs. major trading partners in Q4, the biggest gain since Q4 2008, when the global financial crisis spurred a brief stampede into dollar-denominated assets. As of Jan. 23, that dollar index in 2015 was a whopping 10% higher than Q4's average, turbocharged by central bank easings around the world.The ruble has lost half its value against the dollar in the past year. The yen lost about 15%, the euro 18.5% and the British pound 11.7%. The Chinese yuan, loosely pegged to the dollar, flattened last year after gaining strength slowly in recent years.Some analysts see cause for optimism, especially given oil prices' dramatic fall.""There is a question of (cheaper) energy being a windfall ... for consumers worldwide and with a weakening eurozone currency, does that bode well for S&P (500) profits?"" said Robert Keiser, vice president at S&P Capital IQ. ""In theory, yes. In theory, the global macroeconomic outlook is improving.""But in reality, his theory hasn't caught up yet to many U.S. companies reliant on overseas sales.The dollar will be ""a substantial headwind for us in 2015,"" DuPont (DD) CFO Nick Fanandakis said in a Tuesday conference call. He figures that forex will take 60 cents, or 12.7%, off his profit estimate to about $4.10 per share this year. Analysts expected $4.46. Shares fell 1.3%.Like Pfizer and Novartis, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) expects foreign exchange rates to cut 2015 revenue by $800 million and EPS by 12-14 cents. Bristol guided full-year sales to $14 billion to $15 billion and EPS to $1.55 to $1.70. Shares fell 0.8% Tuesday.It's hard to measure the dollar's impact on the overall S&P 500 — whose large-cap companies tend to have heavy overseas exposure — because the handling and accounting of foreign revenue vary from firm to firm.It's easier to analyze the effect of collapsing oil prices on corporate America: Q4 S&P 500 earnings are on track to rise 3.3%, but would be up nearly 7% excluding the energy sector, said Gregory Harrison, a senior analyst at Thomson Reuters.

1361,PFE,"Shares of Puma Biotechnology were down 14% to around 193 in morning trading on the stock market today after the company said late Tuesday that it will file for FDA approval of its first drug a year later than expected.
"
1362,PFE,"Puma (PBYI) said that it will file for approval of breast-cancer drug neratinib in the first quarter of 2016, after previously saying that it would file in the first half of 2015. The reason is that the company wants approval for an earlier stage of breast cancer than previously planned, which would mean that the patients would take the drug for longer than the metastatic cases that Puma had originally targeted. This change led the FDA to ask for preclinical data on whether and how much the drug itself induces cancer after long-term use.
"
1363,PFE,"Neratinib, a drug that Pfizer (PFE) was so uninterested in that it licensed it out to Puma in 2011, turned out to be the summer's surprise hit when it solidly outperformed a placebo as an extend adjuvant therapy — i.e., it was given to patients for a year after an initial treatment with surgery.
"
1364,PFE,"That discovery drove the stock up 233% on July 23, not only on the prospects for neratinib but on the prospects for Puma as a buyout target.
"
1365,PFE,"However, last month another trial putting neratinib head to head against the market leader, Roche's (RHHBY) Herceptin, did not break in favor of neratinib, knocking nearly 10% off the stock.

1367,PFE,"Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.Shares of Puma Biotechnology were down 14% to around 193 in morning trading on the stock market today after the company said late Tuesday that it will file for FDA approval of its first drug a year later than expected.Puma (PBYI) said that it will file for approval of breast-cancer drug neratinib in the first quarter of 2016, after previously saying that it would file in the first half of 2015. The reason is that the company wants approval for an earlier stage of breast cancer than previously planned, which would mean that the patients would take the drug for longer than the metastatic cases that Puma had originally targeted. This change led the FDA to ask for preclinical data on whether and how much the drug itself induces cancer after long-term use.Neratinib, a drug that Pfizer (PFE) was so uninterested in that it licensed it out to Puma in 2011, turned out to be the summer's surprise hit when it solidly outperformed a placebo as an extend adjuvant therapy — i.e., it was given to patients for a year after an initial treatment with surgery.That discovery drove the stock up 233% on July 23, not only on the prospects for neratinib but on the prospects for Puma as a buyout target.However, last month another trial putting neratinib head to head against the market leader, Roche's (RHHBY) Herceptin, did not break in favor of neratinib, knocking nearly 10% off the stock.

1391,PFE,"When it comes to developing cutting-edge real estate for Big Pharma and tech firms, Alexandria Real Estate Equities CEO Joel Marcus has refined a tried-and-true formula.Started by Marcus back in 1994, Alexandria (ARE) is a real estate investment trust focused on developing science and technology campuses in top urban clusters, adjacent to leading academic and medical institutions, in order to create a collaborative environment.The company's activity is centered on science hubs — such as Cambridge, Mass., the San Francisco Bay Area, San Diego and New York City.""Our platform focuses on irreplaceable urban innovation centers,"" Marcus told IBD.""They're great places to recruit talent, the transportation is good and they have a 24/7 work-play environment,"" he added. ""We try to own and operate and dominate the market in these irreplaceable markets.""The facilities are high tech and advanced, he says, and they include the kind of infrastructure that companies need to do research and development.""We take the campus location and state-of-the-art facilities and marry them at the intersection of science and technology,"" Marcus said. ""That's really been the secret of our success.""Building For Big NamesUsing this approach, Alexandria has developed campuses for drugmakers such as Eli Lilly (LLY), Novartis (NVS) and Pfizer (PFE), plus IBD Leaderboard stock Illumina (ILMN), a genetic-testing equipment maker.This year, which marks Alexandria's 20th anniversary, the company has had plenty of cause to celebrate. Earnings have started to grow again, with double-digit increases the past two quarters, after no gains from the end of 2011 through 2013.In the third quarter, earnings rose 14% to $1.21 a share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect 2014 earnings to rise 11% to $4.79 a share following declines the prior four years. They see an 8% rise in 2015 and a 4% increase in 2016.Alexandria's stock price has lifted 36% this year.What's been fueling its growth? Marcus says Alexandria has several factors working in its favor.""We're in a very good economic environment, the Fed has kept interest rates low and we've seen substantially rising rents in urban innovation markets,"" he said. ""There's also a constrained supply. The demand we're seeing from the life science and tech sectors are the highest levels we've seen in the 20-year history of the company.""Marcus adds that the company is seeing ""strong internal growth,"" driven by high occupancy and increasing rental rates in its core markets of Cambridge, San Francisco and New York.Alexandria has a $1 billion pipeline of projects under construction, around 85% of which are leased or under negotiations, says Marcus. That's the highest pre-lease level Alexandria has had.The company has another $1 billion pipeline of projects it will put into play in 2015, he says, adding that both pipelines will help drive ""strong demand and continued up earnings"" over the next few years.Marcus, who used to work as a capital markets lawyer, founded Alexandria to address the real estate infrastructure needs of the biotech industry, which he says were unfilled at the time.""We have a first-mover advantage in almost every market in real estate development,"" he said. ""We focus on urban innovation campuses, and no one else really does that.""Healthy Outlook?RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Carroll says one competitor is BioMed Realty Trust (BMR). It's a REIT focused on providing real estate to the life science industry. Other REITs also dabble in the space, he adds, but it's the location of Alexandria's campuses in urban cluster markets that's the differentiating factor.Carroll said the macro environment for the life science industry looks good: ""You're starting to see the pharma tenants that used to own their own real estate in other locations are finding they're getting better results (in terms of) their ability to do research and collaborate more with people within the industry when they move to these core cluster markets owned by other landlords.""Alexandria has been able to create cluster market campuses in some of the major markets in the U.S., Carroll adds.""Now that tech tenants are finding that they like that atmosphere, they're getting demand from tech tenants too,"" he said.One recent tech project, announced in September, is a strategic partnership with app developer Uber Technologies, whose low-fare ride-sharing service has caught on as a taxi alternative. The project includes the acquisition of two key parcels in the Mission Bay area of San Francisco.What's The Deal With Uber?These parcels will support 422,980 rentable square feet of new, ground-up facilities. The joint venture will be 51% owned by Alexandria and 49% by Uber. It will let Uber expand its corporate headquarters in San Francisco in conjunction with a 15-year lease for the entire project.Alexandria is expected to break ground on the project in January 2015 and finish it by the end of 2016.Mission Bay is home to a campus of the University of California, San Francisco, as well as Alexandria's science and technology cluster, which was recently selected to house the future arena of the Golden State Warriors of the NBA.Marcus said the Uber venture is ""very significant because it has very strong yields, and shareholders will reap the benefits with great cash flow.""It represents a milestone to bring more tech companies to Mission Bay, which historically was more of a life science destination, Marcus adds.Carroll also called the venture with Uber significant: ""There's a lot of demand in that area ... in Mission Bay South of Market (SoMa) in San Francisco.""With a market cap around $6.2 billion, Alexandria is one of the smaller companies in IBD's Finance-Property REIT industry group; the largest is Simon Property Group (SPG) with a market cap of $56.6 billion.The group ranks No. 79 in performance of the 197 that IBD tracks.The Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group, where several of Alexandria's customers reside, ranks No. 23, and Medical-Biomed/Biotech ranks No. 4.

1405,PFE,"It didn't take long for a major buyout to have a positive impact on Minerals Technologies' financial results — or for Wall Street to take note of the specialty mineral producer's blowout third quarter.Minerals Technologies (MTX) shares rose 20% over a six-session period beginning on Sept. 24 — setting new closing highs each session and ending at a closing peak of 76.71 on Oct. 31 — after the company sprinted past Q3 earnings views and saw its revenue more than double from the prior year.A big driver of the gains was its May buyout of Amcol International, an Illinois-based producer of bentonite clay.That $1.7 billion deal came after Minerals Technologies won a bidding war for Amcol against Imerys, a French industrial materials firm. The addition of Amcol fattened the top line and widened the company's footprint into new geographies and product categories.Paper ChaseThe business of MTI — short for Minerals Technologies Inc. — includes five segments: Specialty Minerals, Refractories, Performance Materials, Construction Technologies and Energy Services.It is probably best known as the world's largest producer of precipitated calcium carbonates (PCC) used in the manufacture of paper. The PCC business accounted for 47% of MTI's revenue in 2013.The Amcol acquisition expanded MTI's business on a couple of fronts, CEO Joseph Muscari told IBD: ""It gives us more diversification in minerals, so we are staying close to what we know. It also helps us from a geographic expansion standpoint. We're able to do more in terms of leveraging the resources we have in India, China, Thailand, Indonesia and South America.""The addition of Amcol helped MTI deliver what Muscari called its ""highest quarter ever."" MTI dates back to 1992, when it was spun off from Pfizer (PFE).On Oct. 23, MTI logged Q3 earnings of $1.25 a share, up from 63 cents the prior year and well above consensus estimates. Sales more than doubled to $543.5 million.In a research note, JPMorgan analyst Jeffrey Zekauskas said MTI's operating income of $76.8 million exceeded his own forecast of $69.8 million, reflecting a ""better-than-expected operating performance and cost synergies in the acquired Amcol divisions.""MTI is about nine months ahead of schedule in terms of cost savings from the Amcol buyout, Zekauskas noted. Much of the work ahead will be focused on improving Amcol's operations. ""We believe there is a large runway for (MTI) to improve business processes across the company,"" he said. ""The Amcol plants run at very low levels of capacity utilization, and overhead costs are relatively high.""CEO Muscari said the sharp rise in MTI's stock price following its Q3 earnings release was partly due to the way it has handled the Amcol acquisition: ""We hadn't done an acquisition of this size before, so investors could see we were able to do it very well — that synergies were falling to the bottom line. Over the next two to three years we are going to be very focused on integrating Amcol and capturing all the synergies.""MTI also eyes big things from Amcol's main product. Bentonite boasts a diverse number of end uses that range from cat litter to construction products and bondings for metal castings.The latter category shows particular promise, Muscari said, particularly in China: ""China is the largest casting producing market in the world, and (Amcol) has a good market share there. As the China market continues to grow, we will grow with it.""More than half of MTI's 2013 revenue came from the U.S., while 27% came from Europe and Africa. Although Asia markets contributed only 11% of the total, that figure is likely to move much higher in coming years as MTI looks to grow its presence in the region.""China and India are at the top of the list in terms of geographic expansion, along with Southeast Asia and Brazil,"" Muscari said. ""We have been in China since the '90s, so we have very well established management there. In India, we didn't even have a position at all in paper PCC four years ago. Today we have a relatively high market share for paper makers there.""R&D EffortsOne way MTI boosts its market share is through product development, particularly in its PCC business. The company's research and development efforts focus on helping customers save money, produce higher quality products and reduce pollution.Muscari points to MTI's Fulfill brand of high-filler technologies. These are designed to let manufacturers put more filler in their paper and less pulp, which saves money.While new products and markets will help MTI expand its top line, the company's bottom line should get a boost from a restructuring program that mainly involves reducing its workforce.According to MTI's Q3 earnings release, the restructuring will occur across all business segments and is estimated to provide annualized savings of $20 million.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect MTI to report full-year 2014 earnings of $3.80 a share, up 57% from the prior year. They see 2015 EPS rising 19% to $4.51.Mineral Technologies belongs to IBD's Chemicals-Specialty group. The largest stocks in the group by market cap are Praxair (PX), Air Products & Chemicals (APD) and Sigma-Aldrich (SIAL).

1406,PFE,"Big-cap biotech Amgen (AMGN) beat Wall Street's third-quarter estimates and guided full-year earnings a bit above consensus Monday, sending its recently hot stock up 1% in after-hours trading.Amgen's earnings excluding one-time items rose 19% over the year-ago quarter to $2.30 a share, beating analysts' consensus by 19 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Sales increased 6% to $5.03 billion, about $70 million ahead of estimates.On the conference call to discuss results, CEO Robert Bradway noted that last year's Q3 included a $155 million order for anemia drug Neupogen from the U.S. government, which inflated that quarter's sales. Backing that out, sales growth was 8%, consistent with the first half of the year.The $518 million in Q3 sales of Neulasta, a drug stimulating white blood cells, beat consensus by more than $60 million, and was 5% over last year's third quarter. This was driven by price increases more than volume, according to Amgen. The story was virtually identical with anemia drug Epogen, whose sales rose 5% over last year also for price reasons, to total $518 million. Analysts had expected $486 million.Rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel missed estimates with a 3% dip in sales, though units grew 3% year over year. On the call, CFO David Meline reminded analysts that Q2 had seen an inventory build that was burned off in Q3, ""masking the strength in demand.""Nonetheless Enbrel helped drive the overall profit growth, since it is no longer under a profit-sharing agreement with Pfizer (PFE).Research and development spending of $980 million was more than $60 million lower than analysts' consensus, while sales, general and administrative spending was also about $60 million below the Street's estimate of $1.09 billion.The company added $300 million to its full-year revenue guidance, now $19.8 billion to $20 billion, slightly above the Street's forecast and up from $18.7 billion last year. It guided full-year EPS at $8.45 to $8.55, up from its previous range of $8.20 to $8.40 and above analysts' target of $8.42. However, that implies Q4 EPS between $1.91 and $2.01, which is short of the Street's average of $2.04. Last year, the company made $7.60 a share in the full year and $1.82 in the fourth quarter.On the conference call, Meline said that Amgen is lifting its 2014 tax rate estimate by a percentage point from 16% to 17%, due to uncertainties about the extension of the U.S. federal R&D tax credit. However, Cowen analyst Eric Schmidt commented that even accounting for that, a Q4 increase in operating expenses was implied in the guidance.Meline answered that expenses usually increase at the end of the year so this was ""nothing unusual."" However, Bradway added that the company is preparing for product launches next year, which also will increase spending.The most anticipated of these on the Street is evolocumab, the first in a new class of cholesterol drugs called anti-PCSK9s. Analysts expect sales could run up to $2 billion, though forecasts remain uncertain as Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) is seen launching a competing product shortly thereafter.The management kept the call short as they planned to hold a business review meeting on Tuesday, at which they're expected to give a longer-term outlook on the company's business and strategy. They're also expected to address shareholder pressure to split into two parts, which got extra publicity last week from Daniel Loeb, hedge-fund manager at Third Point Capital.Loeb, taking an idea proposed by Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges in June, argued that making like Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Pfizer and splitting off the established legacy drugs such as Enbrel from the newer and more innovative products would unlock ""hidden value.""That chatter, along with the general recovery of biotech stocks, has helped drive up Amgen's stock over the last week. During regular trading Monday it hit a new high of 148.47, eventually closing up 0.6% to 148.20.

1407,PFE,"December is usually a quiet month for medical tech news, but this year will bring a few potentially stock-moving events worth keeping an eye on.As you digest your Thanksgiving turkey, here are the top five in chronological order:By Dec. 5, biotech Incyte (INCY) is looking to get an important expansion of the label on its sole marketed drug, Jakafi. As explained in the recent Incyte profile in The New America, Incyte and its partner Novartis (NVS) have been pulling in respectable income on Jakafi as a treatment for a rare bone-marrow cancer called myelofibrosis. The FDA is pondering whether to add an indication for polycythemia vera, a milder but more common condition. While uptake for that condition is expected to be fairly slow, it's expected to help push Incyte into more consistently profitable territory next year.Two days later, hot medical-device company Edwards Lifesciences (EW) will hold its annual investor day, in which it is expected to give 2015 guidance for the first time. The company impressed the Street last month with its strong Q3 report and Q4 guidance, on the strong launch of its latest Sapien artificial heart valve. Currently, analysts are forecasting 2015 sales of $2.47 billion, up 7% from this year's estimate. Earnings per share are expected to rise 17% to $3.95.Then, sometime before Dec. 21 (which likely means Dec. 19), the FDA is due to issue its verdict on AbbVie's (ABBV) hepatitis C combo of Viekirax and Exviera. The clinical-trial data was so good, the Street would probably be less surprised if a meteor hit Manhattan than if the FDA rejects the drug, but what has analysts all on pins and needles is what the price will be. A price significantly lower than Gilead Sciences ' (GILD) recently launched Harvoni, which costs $94,000 for a 12-week treatment, would help AbbVie gain market share and certainly please pharmacy benefit managers like Express Scripts (ESRX), which has been hoping to start a price war to drive down the suddenly high cost of hepatitis C treatment. However, most analysts are expecting AbbVie to price only a little bit lower. Also affected by all this will be Enanta Pharmaceuticals (ENTA), which licensed a component of Viekirax to AbbVie.Speaking of hepatitis C, sometime before the end of the year the Street is expecting to hear phase one clinical-trial data on Achillion Pharmaceuticals' (ACHN) ACH-3422. The drug belongs to the coveted nucleoside inhibitor class, to which Gilead's mega-blockbuster Sovaldi (also a component in Harvoni) belongs, but which has otherwise shown enough safety issues that there are few left in development. Especially since Merck (MRK) acquired Idenix Pharmaceuticals for its ""nuc,"" speculation that Achillion could be the next target has driven up its stock price, but the Street has seen little real data about the safety and effectiveness of ACH-3422. The data would help analysts determine just how much the company is worth.Speculation exists about whether two aborted takeover attempts earlier this year will be re-upped. The Street seems to have mostly given up on the possibility that Pfizer (PFE) will make another bid for AstraZeneca (AZN) after the six-month cooling-off period mandated under U.K. takeover rules expired on Wednesday. Astra's CEO Pascal Soriot threw more cold water while appearing on CNBC Thursday, saying the deal would have fallen apart even if it had been made because of proposed restrictions on tax-inversion deals in the U.S. However, RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro is still holding out hope for a union of orthopedics firms Stryker (SYK) and Smith & Nephew (SNN). Stryker didn't bid for the company, but since a news report leaked that it was working on one, it got slapped with the U.K.'s six-month cooling-off period anyway, which expired Nov. 28.""We believe a SYK/SNN deal could provide more recon (reconstructive surgery) scale, particularly in international markets, expand SYK's presence in trauma/sports medicine, and bring cost synergies,"" Novarro wrote in a note Friday.

1417,PFE,"When the FDA last month approved the first biosimilar drug, the U.S. took its first step into a lucrative but potentially disruptive field of medicine.Pfizer (PFE), which is moving big into biosimilars with its $17 billion Hospira (HSP) acquisition, has estimated that global biosimilar sales could hit $17 billion to $20 billion per year by 2020. Sales are just $1 billion yearly now, mainly in the European Union.With the March 5 approval of Zarxio, Novartis' (NVS) biosimilar version of Amgen's (AMGN) aging blockbuster Neupogen, the U.S. market cracked open.""As the FDA becomes more comfortable ... we're going to see biosimilars get through a lot more easily,"" predicted Jitendra Malik, an attorney with Alston & Bird who specializes in intellectual-property and drug-approval issues. ""The first one's always the hardest to get through, because the FDA is more cautious — it's uncharted territory.""For years, the biotech revolution not only brought life-saving new medicines, but also profit-saving protections against competitors. While traditional pharmaceuticals can be assembled by machines from different chemical ingredients, biologic drugs are formed by biological processes, like a high-tech version of fermentation. Many of these processes are trade secrets that, unlike patents, have no expiration date.Reverse EngineeringAs more companies became familiar with biotech manufacturing, however, they were able to reverse-engineer the process to create biosimilar drugs — not identical to the originals, but close enough. Novartis' Sandoz unit, historically devoted to traditional generic drugs, has been a pioneer in the field, already selling biosimilar versions of Neupogen and its sister drug Epogen in Europe.Many others are lined up at the U.S. border with their own products. Hospira and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) have launched their own versions of Neupogen in Europe. Some companies are working on biosimilar versions of AbbVie's (ABBV) blockbuster immunology drug Humira, including Sandoz, Hospira, Pfizer (prior to acquiring Hospira), Amgen and German pharma giant Boehringer Ingelheim.When AbbVie announced its richly priced acquisition of Pharmacyclics (PCYC) in March, some analysts figured it was driven by the need for another blockbuster in the face of Humira competitors.Key Biologics Face RivalsOther drugs with biosimilar versions in late-stage testing include Biogen's (BIIB) cancer drug Rituxan, Roche's (RHHBY) breast-cancer treatment Herceptin, and Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Remicade. And Merck (MRK) is developing a biosimilar version of Sanofi's (SNY) popular diabetes drug Lantus.Hospira's biosimilar version of Remicade already has been approved in Europe and was expected to be OK'd in the U.S. in Q1. But in February, the FDA delayed its advisory-panel meeting on the product ""due to information requests pending with the sponsor of the application.""Analysts are closely watching the biosimilar's rollout in Europe. Remicade is approved for a variety of ailments, from psoriasis to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to rheumatoid arthritis, and will provide a test case for how willing the different specialists are to use the knockoff without independent studies.""B(iosimilar)-Remicade was approved without gastroenterology studies, which account for 50% of Remicade sales,"" wrote Leerink analyst Jason Gerberry in a December research report. ""Some gastroenterology specialists we've spoken with do not plan to use b-Remicade for IBD indications until clinical studies report out in late 2015 or 2016.""In Europe, biosimilar versions of Neupogen have taken about 30% of the market. Analysts generally expect the same for the U.S., but much depends on where the drugs are priced.Generic pharmaceuticals generally go for a fraction of the original drug's price, driving the retail value down so much that the original developers stop marketing the products (though they do keep manufacturing them). Biosimilars are more difficult and expensive to develop, so there are fewer players and less pricing competition.Novartis still hasn't launched Zarxio and is keeping mum about its price. Company spokeswoman Geena Wardaki told Investor's Business Daily in an email, ""For biosimilars in general, we typically expect discounts to be in the range of 10% to 30% below the reference biologic. However, this depends on therapeutic area, market, channel, number of competitors and reimbursement situation.""CMS Vs. FDA On BiosimilarsOn Tuesday, the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced that physicians prescribing Medicare Part B drugs would be reimbursed for biosimilars in the same way as for the original drugs — average selling price plus 6%. Pharmacies dispensing part D drugs can exclude the original from their lists of preferred drugs in favor of the biosimilar if they wish, so long as they provide a transitional supply of the original for patients already taking it.That implies that CMS is treating biosimilars as effectively interchangeable with the originals, further muddying an issue that's already unclear. The FDA ruled that although Zarxio can be used for all five of the uses approved for Neupogen — boosting blood cells in various kinds of cancer patients — it's not technically interchangeable. That means that if a doctor prescribes the original drug, a pharmacy can't fill it with the biosimilar.That doesn't matter so much for Zarxio, since the drug is administered via hospitals and clinics rather than retail pharmacies. Nonetheless, some drugmakers might find it worthwhile to file separately for an interchangeability approval, which will likely involve studies of patients switching between products, say experts in the matter.""That would be a deterrent to a second person coming in,"" said Malik. ""If I can show that my product is interchangeable, that doesn't necessarily mean that another applicant down the road can do the same thing just by piggybacking on me. In a lot of cases, the structure (of the original drug) is not perfectly known, and you do have to spend time convincing people that it's the same.""Yet another question is how aggressive the payers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) will be in pushing biosimilars ahead of the original drugs to save costs. In a March 29 report, analyst Gerberry wrote that two unnamed ""payer specialists"" had told him that payers will probably leave a grace period of six to 12 months for doctors to get used to biosimilars, but then start to lean harder.""Specialists expect policies to grandfather stable patients receiving anti-TNF therapy (e.g., Remicade) at same reimbursement, but new patients or new switches would likely be required to go through a prior authorization requiring patients use biosimilar first,"" he wrote.Gillian Woollett, senior vice president at the consulting firm Avalere Health, says another issue is naming. When a company develops a new drug, it gets a generic (also called nonproprietary) name and a brand name, and the generic name (filgrastim, in the case of Neupogen) is used by all generic drugmakers when the patents expire.What's In A Name?Many biologics approved by the FDA, even when they have never been compared, also share nonproprietary names because this is simply the name of the active ingredient and not the name of the product. Biosimilars in most other markets share the nonproprietary name of their reference product too, but in the U.S., with the first approval, the FDA assigned makers a ""placeholder nonproprietary name,"" in this case filgrastim-sndz.""The naming thing is an important space to watch,"" Woollett told Investor's Business Daily. ""I think these are all going to be branded products, and all biosimilars, like most originator biologics, will have brand names — again, the generic-drug situation is totally different, as most generics do not have brand names.""

1449,PFE,"Sometimes, drug launches take a while to get off the ground. Incyte's only approved drug, Jakafi, has been on the market three years, but it's really only just getting started.Jakafi, sold in some markets as Jakavi, is approved for a rare bone-marrow cancer called myelofibrosis (MF). Thanks to that indication, Incyte's (INCY) revenue is expected to pass $530 million this year, compared with just $94 million in 2011, the year Jakafi launched.It's the other indications in the pipeline, however, that could really push the drug into blockbuster territory.The first of these, expected to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration by Dec. 5, is for polycythemia vera (PV), a similar but somewhat milder disease, which has a potentially larger market.Meanwhile, clinical trials are going on for the really big-name cancers: pancreatic, breast, lung and colon.Current consensus estimates have Jakafi's annual sales in the U.S. hitting $1.3 billion by 2020. Abroad, where Incyte splits the take with marketing partner Novartis (NVS), sales are expected to pass $900 million by that year.""Incyte is based on the idea that research in cancer is a good investment,"" CEO Herve Hoppenot told IBD in an interview.Opportunity SeizedJakafi is a Janus associated kinase (JAK) inhibitor, regulating the signaling mechanisms in cells that play an important role in cell growth and immune response.Jakafi was the first JAK inhibitor on the market and so far the only one approved to fight cancer. Pfizer's (PFE) Xeljanz, approved in 2012, is also a JAK inhibitor but is used against rheumatoid arthritis.Hoppenot says that Incyte was originally aiming at the big cancers first, but the MF opportunity unexpectedly came up when scientists found that the JAK signaling played an important role in the disease.""At that point, the company decided to move the development program very quickly to myelofibrosis and try to prove that the JAK pathway was having an impact on the outcome for these patients,"" he said. ""We were able to get the pivotal studies done and the approval for myelofibrosis in a very rapid way.""Another advantage that the MF market brought to the firm was a small patient pool that had no other treatment options, so Incyte has been able to market it domestically without bringing in a big-pharma partner. It can thus keep all the domestic revenues for itself.Pursuing PV was the next logical step, Hoppenot says, because the diseases are so similar. Both of them are myeloproliferative disorders, which means that excess cells are produced in the bone marrow.PV, however, is much milder and can sometimes have no symptoms at all. Hoppenot estimates that only about 25% of the roughly 100,000 PV patients in the U.S. are eligible for Jakafi. He expects the liftoff to be fairly slow, because treating PV isn't as urgent as treating more malignant cancers.But the eventual market could be larger than that of MF, which has fewer than 14,000 sufferers, according to Leerink's estimate.These two diseases should bring Incyte its first annual profit next year, according to a consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Incyte turned a profit of 33 cents a share in the most recently reported quarter, but only because of two milestone payments that Incyte collected from Novartis on winning reimbursement for Jakafi in Europe and marketing approval in Japan.Starting in the second half of next year, analysts expect Incyte to start turning an operating profit in a more consistent way.Rivalry In The WingsThe year after that, however, new competition could threaten Jakafi. Gilead Sciences' (GILD) JAK inhibitor momelotinib is in a late-stage trial for MF, designed to compare momelotinib with Jakafi head to head. The results are expected to come out sometime next year.A couple of smaller players, CTI BioPharma (CTIC) and Geron (GERN), also have competitors in late-stage testing. On Nov. 13, the latter licensed its candidate, imetelstat, to Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) for development in multiple diseases, under a deal potentially worth $935 million if all the milestones are realized.Although only the data will tell how competitive these products will be, Incyte has other tools in its garage.INCB24360, a candidate from another drug class called IDO1 inhibitors, is being tested in combination with some of the most anticipated cancer drugs in the pipeline, the PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors. Incyte has partnered with all four of the leading contenders in the field — Bristol-Myers (BMY), AstraZeneca (AZN), Roche (RHHBY), and Merck (MRK) — to test their drugs together for a variety of cancers.These are not licensing deals, says Hoppenot. But they do mean that if and when the drugs are approved, the companies can recommend a successful combination on the drugs' labels.INCB24360 also garnered some attention at this summer's American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting, when it performed well in a trial combining it with a different though related Bristol-Myers drug, Yervoy, to treat melanoma.Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt wrote at the time that while the combo didn't appear to be as effective as Yervoy combined with Bristol's in-house anti-PD-1 Opdivo, it did suggest promise for combinations of INCB24360 with other anti-PD-1s.This news, along with a better-than-expected third quarter report last month, induced Goldman Sachs analyst Navdeep Singh to lift his rating on Incyte to neutral from sell and nearly double his price target to 62.""Our sell thesis was based on our more cautious view on Jakafi's launch for myelofibrosis (MF) given safety and competition, but this call has not worked as the narrative has shifted to INCY's pipeline,"" Singh wrote in his Oct. 31 research note. He added that following the newly out Q3 results and ASCO 2014, ""we are more encouraged by: (1) strong underlying growth for Jakafi in MF and (2) early data and partnership interest for IDO1 inhibitor.""

1452,PFE,"French biotech Cellectis (CLLS) slipped 5.3% in its Nasdaq debut Wednesday to close at 39.30 after enlarging its deal size to $229 million.Cellectis sold 5.5 million shares at $41.50 each, the price being essentially determined by where the stock was trading on the Alternet market of the Euronext Paris exchange. The company, however, sold 750,000 more shares than it had announced just a day before, when it upped its planned deal size by 50% from the original 3.5 million.The rising share count reflected the interest in CAR T-cell therapy, a branch of cancer treatment that in the last 12 months produced very successful IPOs for Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), Kite Pharma (KITE) and, to a lesser extent, Bellicum Pharmaceuticals (BLCM).Cellectis, however, started trading on a bad day for the market in general and for biotechs in particular: IBD's Medical - Biomed/Biotech group also fell 5.3% on Wednesday.Still, the IPO valued Cellectis at $1.5 billion, which is pretty steep for a drugmaker that hasn't even started human testing yet. The company has four products in animal testing for different types of blood cancer, in collaboration with Pfizer (PFE) and French drugmaker Servier.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.

1491,PFE,"Big pharma AbbVie's $21 billion deal to acquire hot biotech Pharmacyclics was met with widespread skepticism by AbbVie investors Thursday, sending AbbVie's stock falling 5.7% Thursday.AbbVie (ABBV) announced the cash-and-stock acquisition late Wednesday after rumors had been swirling all afternoon that Novartis (NVS) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) were engaged in a bidding war for Pharmacyclics (PCYC). It surprised Wall Street that AbbVie turned out to be the buyer, especially since J&J already has a partnership with Pharmacyclics to market its blood-cancer drug Imbruvica.""What doesn't really make sense to us is AbbVie prevailing over PCYC's partner and natural buyer, JNJ, to secure PCYC, and paying the price that they did for the asset,"" Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a research note Thursday. ""We believed that JNJ was the only buyer able to secure the operational advantage of full control by buying out their partner, and JNJ, more than any other buyer, would have been able to maximize the synergies by reducing the product's support to a single commercial organization.""The cash-and-stock deal values Pharmacyclics at 261 a share. Its stock rose 10% Thursday to 254.22. The stock traded at 122 at the start of the year.In a conference call with analysts early Thursday, AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez affirmed that the bidding war had come down to three contestants, which he didn't name. He justified the price by citing the enormous market potential for Imbruvica, which launched in late 2013 and brought Pharmacyclics $548 million last year. By AbbVie's reckoning, Imbruvica will bring the firm $7 billion a year at peak — and that's with no change to the existing deal that splits the profits with J&J.Evercore ISI says this assumes total worldwide sales of $11.5 billion to $12 billion, which would make Imbruvica the biggest-selling cancer drug in history, says analyst Mark Schoenebaum. Analysts' consensus sales estimates are bullish but not that bullish: For 2025, the latest year available, the average estimate is $8.3 billion.On the call, Gonzalez broke down the assumptions behind that number. About 25% of the growth would come from expansion in Imbruvica's currently approved uses, as a second-line treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle-cell lymphoma, as well as an anytime treatment for the less common conditions of CLL with 17p deletion and Waldenstrom's macroglobulemia.An additional 30% would come from expansion into first-line treatment for CLL and lymphoma, which Gonzalez says has a ""very high probability of success,"" given the clinical-trial data.The rest would come from unspecified amounts accounting for approval in other cancers of the B cells, and a more speculative assumption that the product will also work on solid tumors.""We did see the data on solid tumors, and we were impressed,"" Gonzalez said.Many analysts viewed AbbVie's late-stage blood-cancer candidate ABT-199 as a potential competitor to Imbruvica. Chief Scientific Officer Michael Severino said the two drugs can potentially work in combination, and he expects to launch clinical trials to prove it.In general, executives said the acquisition should boost AbbVie's entire cancer business by as much as $15 billion or $20 billion by the 2020s. That would be a change of focus for AbbVie, which made its fortune in immunology with the blockbuster drug Humira. However, Humira will likely get biosimilar competition from Amgen (AMGN), Pfizer (PFE) and others after its patent expires in 2018. On the call, Gonzalez affirmed AbbVie's commitment to Humira, both by defending its patents in court and by developing new-and-improved versions of the drug, and said this had nothing to do with the price paid for Pharmacyclics.Analyst Porges, however, said that ""the premium here may be explained by AbbVie's desperation.""

1493,PFE,"With interest rates at record lows in the past several years, ETFs that invest in dividend-paying stocks have been a popular income alternative for some investors. But will they remain advantageous now that the Federal Reserve is seriously considering hiking rates?It depends on the specific investment objectives of each fund, according to Michael Rawson, research analyst at Morningstar Inc.""When you look at stocks with a high dividend payout, they typically underperform when the economy is doing well,"" he says. ""Those companies usually invest less in future growth (utilities, REITs, consumer staples), therefore they don't participate as much when the economy is growing very rapidly.""Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index ETF (VYM) has over $10 billion in assets and a 12-month yield (net of fees) of 2.72%. However, it is tilted toward value stocks, notes Rawson, so it is not the most favorable to be in when the economy is growing.So what should an investor look at when considering a dividend ETF?Value Stock Tilt?Rawson says it's important to consider whether an ETF ""is tilting toward higher-yielding dividend-paying stocks, which tend to be value stocks, or does it tilt toward stocks which might grow their dividend in the future?""Companies that are able to increase their dividends consistently are usually companies with very strong brand names or very strong market positions,"" he notes. An example is Apple (AAPL), which yields 1.5%, though its dividend hasn't been steady.Dividend growth is one of the reasons he likes $21 billion Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG). It looks for companies that have raised their dividends for 10 straight years. It has a lower yield at 1.91%, but focuses on quality stocks, thus having a slightly bigger exposure to growth companies.In addition, it has a razor-thin expense ratio of 0.10%. It has returned an average annual 14.15% in the past three years vs. the S&P 500's 16.57% advance. Top holdings are Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), PepsiCo (PEP), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Coca-Cola (KO).""If the Fed were likely to raise rates, I think Vanguard High Dividend Yield might get hurt more than Vanguard Dividend Appreciation,"" Rawson said.Another element to consider is the fund's tilt toward size: whether it's in large-cap or small-cap stocks.IShares Select Dividend (DVY) is one of the highest-yielding ETFs with a 3.03% yield. But the $15 billion fund is tilted toward midcap deep-value stocks, which can make it more volatile. In addition, its 0.39% expense ratio makes it one of the more expensive dividend ETFs, notes Morningstar analyst Abby Woodham in her report.When the Fed raises rates, investors might consider shifting out of stocks and more toward bonds, said Rawson. The reasons people usually hold bonds is for income, diversification and stability. The reason why dividend ETFs are not always a good substitute for bond ETFs is that they don't have the stability of bonds, he said.Investors also need to be mindful of expenses. If those are high, they tend to eat into the yield of the ETF.Cheapest ETF AvailableSchwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) is the cheapest among all dividend ETFs, with an expense ratio of just 0.07%. With nearly $3 billion in assets, it has a pretty attractive yield of 2.58%, while still maintaining the focus on quality stocks.It looks at companies that have paid dividends in the past 10 years and selects those that do well on fundamental metrics such cash flow/debt, return on equity, dividend yield and dividend growth. It's returned an average annual 15.93% in the past three years. Top holdings are Pfizer (PFE), Verizon Communications (VZ), Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM).International funds tend to provide higher yields, but investors need to be able to stomach higher volatility due to currency fluctuations. The dollar's recent strength has hit the returns of nonhedged ETFs such as the WisdomTree Emerging Markets Equity Income Fund (DEM) and iShares International Select Dividend (IDV).

1497,PFE,"Illumina (ILMN), a maker of DNA sequencing products, said Thursday that it has struck strategic partnerships with several big drugmakers to develop what it calls a universal next-generation sequencing-based oncology test system for cancer diagnosis.The initial strategic partners include AstraZeneca (AZN), Janssen Biotech and Sanofi (SNY).Illumina says the system will be used to conduct clinical trials for specific cancer therapies. It will help identify cancers that might respond to targeted therapies by assessing specific mutations within genes known to be associated with response or resistance to specific cancer therapies. The goal is to develop and commercialize a multi-gene panel for therapeutic selection that provides a more precise and comprehensive tool in fighting cancer.Illumina stock was down a fraction in morning trading in the stock market today, near 172.

1498,PFE,"When it comes to procuring clinical research services, small biotechs are like the average Janes and Joes who must wait in line to enter a nightclub while celebrities are whisked in like royalty the second they show up.In this case, the celebrities are big pharmaceutical firms with the money and clout to jump to the head of the line when they need a contract research organization to manage clinical trials, compile data, conduct studies and provide marketing expertise.Meanwhile, many biotech and biopharma firms are stuck staring at their watches, wondering when they'll get the services they need.Parexel International (PRXL) r ecognized this problem a couple of years ago and did something about it.The company provides biopharmaceutical outsourcing services to the drug, biotech and medical device industries.It operates in three segments. The biggest unit, Clinical Research Services (CRS), contributes about 75% of revenue. The rest is broken down between Parexel Consulting and Medical Communications Services (PCMS), and Perceptive Informatics.Its services range from clinical research and consulting to drug development, regulatory affairs, marketing and information technology solutions.Although the lion's share of Parexel's business comes from large pharmaceutical firms, the company also serves smaller biotech and biopharmaceutical companies.Broad Scope Seals DealsParexel established a dedicated biopharma unit in 2012 that focuses solely on helping small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical clients achieve their development goals.This unit serves a few purposes. For one, smaller clients know they'll get Parexel's full attention without having to worry about competing with Big Pharma clients.""It's a very important selling point for us because there's always a sense that smaller companies must be wary of those who work with larger pharmaceutical firms,"" Parexel Chief Financial Officer Ingo Bank said in a phone interview.""They might ask, 'How can we be sure you won't set us aside to meet Big Pharma's needs?'"" he added. ""That's why we established the biopharma unit a couple of years ago.""Parexel's biopharma unit also offers a wide range of services, which is another important selling point. Unlike Big Pharma companies, which might have large staffs dedicated to regulatory affairs or other parts of the development process, many smaller biotech firms run a bare-bones operation dedicated solely to research.""Biopharmas need more than just a company that helps them run trials,"" Bank said. ""They need technology, data testing, data management, regulatory expertise, someone to assess the health economics of the drugs. We can offer that.""As it turns out, many biopharma firms have a lot more money to spend on such services than a few years ago, which has helped drive more business to Parexel.""Biotech funding has certainly reinvigorated the smaller cap end of Parexel's client base,"" said David Windley, analyst at Jefferies. ""There are a bunch more clients with cash to spend on clinical trials than there used to be.""That's mainly because investors have returned to the biotech sector after many got out following the last decade's financial crisis, he says. Shares of IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech group have more than tripled over the last three years.""Biotech funding has been driven by the equity markets performing well,"" Windley told IBD. ""The risk aversion has kind of abated. Folks are more willing to step out further on the risk curve and invest in unproven technologies. Also, the quality of the research to invest in looks better as well.""Like Bank, Windley says Parexel's dedicated biotech unit goes a long way toward convincing smaller biotech/biopharma clients that they'll get the same level of service as a multibillion-dollar drugmaker.""A small client that knows they're not going to spend as much as a Pfizer (PFE) might be concerned about not getting the same quality of resources,"" Windley said. ""So Parexel created this dedicated unit to target and serve this smaller client, and that's a smart move.""Biotech still represents a small slice of Parexel's overall business. Although the company doesn't break its revenue down by end market, one estimate is that biotech/biopharma contributes 15% or less of overall revenue.Still, CFO Bank says a ""big part of our growth certainly has been in biopharma.""Healthy GrowthThat growth is evident in Parexels' financial returns. It has run off 10 straight quarters of at least double-digit sales and earnings growth.Earlier this month the company logged adjusted earnings of 65 cents a share for its fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, ended in June. That was up 30% from a year earlier and 4 cents above analyst consensus views. Revenue gained 11% to $585.1 million, in line with estimates.The company's bottom line got a boost from higher margins during the quarter. Its consolidated gross margin rose 370 basis points from the previous year to 35.7%, topping Windley's estimate.Margins have been helped by internal initiatives to improve efficiency. These include moving more operations to lower-cost countries such as India and making it easier for workers to access IT tools to handle tasks that used to be done manually.Parexel's full-year fiscal 2014 earnings rose 28% to $2.17 a share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect annual EPS to rise 24% this fiscal year and 19% in fiscal 2016.The company looks to continue its growth streak by taking advantage of a couple of trends that have changed the contract research industry — not just for Parexel, but also for other players in the field such as Covance (CVD) and Quintiles Transnational (Q).""From a macro standpoint, the days of blockbuster drugs are over,"" Bank said. ""We are seeing a much larger number of molecules that address smaller patient populations, so we are doing more work there.""Another trend, he says, is that technology approaches such as informatics have become ""very pervasive"" in the drug and biotech fields.""Clients are asking us to help them integrate data from different sources and systems, and help them better understand the clinical perspective and the trial perspective,"" Bank said. ""You need a very strong IT capability on a global scale to do that, and we have one of the strongest IT offerings in the industry.""

1564,PFE,"Late Sunday, Pfizer issued a press release saying that it had bid 55 pounds — about $92.50 — a share for AstraZeneca, for a total of $117 billion. The bid was not only about 15% higher than Pfizer's last bid, which AstraZeneca had rejected, but it also comprised 45% cash and 55% stock, addressing AstraZeneca's concerns that the 33%-67% ratio of the earlier bid involved too much stock.

1604,PFE,"British pharma giant AstraZeneca (AZN) announced a new drug approval Tuesday and rolled out a strategy to nearly double revenue over the next decade, furthering its quest to convince shareholders not to yield to Pfizer's (PFE) takeover attempt. Shareholders did not seem excited, however, as AstraZeneca's stock was down a fraction on the stock market today.

1605,PFE,"Astra said that the FDA had approved Epanova, a treatment for severe hypertriglyceridaemia, or elevated levels of fat in the blood. The firm said that about 4 million U.S. adults suffer from the condition, but consensus estimates put annual sales at less than $300 million by 2020, which is fairly small potatoes in the world of big pharma. So in a separate press release and conference call detailing its long-term targets, the company focused on bigger game.
"
1606,PFE,"Astra projected annual sales of heart-disease drug Brilinta to reach $3.5 billion in 2023. This is an ambitious target, since the drug brought in less than $300 million last year and analysts are estimating just over $1 billion in sales in 2020.

On the conference call, the company said that MEDI4736, its immuno-oncology drug currently in phase-two testing for lung cancer, could be ready for an approval filing by 2016. Some analysts believe that immuno-oncology is one of the big reasons Pfizer bid $106 billion for AstraZeneca, since Bristol and Merck (MRK) have already begun rolling submissions for their own immuno-oncology drugs while Pfizer has no presence in that space.
"
1609,PFE,"Such growth lies off in the future, however. Astra has been shrinking as its major drugs have gone off patent. The company affirmed that 2017 revenues will be ""broadly in line with those of 2013,"" with growth lifting off after that.

1713,PFE,"At the American Association for Cancer Research meeting on Sunday, Pfizer presented final results from its phase-two trial of palbo in patients with metastatic breast cancer. As IBD reported last month, investors were greatly interested in the presentation after an interim analysis in 2012 showed a massive progression-free survival benefit. The question was whether Pfizer could translate that into an overall-survival benefit.
"
1714,PFE,"In Sunday's presentation of the Paloma-1 trial, the PFS benefit was somewhat smaller but still substantial — 10.2 months, compared with 18.6 months in the interim analysis. The overall-survival benefit was 4.2 months, but that was not statistically significant.
"
1715,PFE,"Analyst Mark Schoenebaum of ISI Group pointed out that since the study enrolled fewer than 200 patients, it would have been very difficult to produce a statistically significant overall-survival, or OS, benefit. The company plans to launch a larger phase-three trial that might yet score. But Sunday's news seemed to sink hopes that Pfizer would file on phase-two data alone.

1732,PFE,"Big pharmas Pfizer (PFE) and AstraZeneca (AZN) were both up in early trading on the stock market today after word got out Sunday that Pfizer had offered $101 billion to buy its rival.
"

"
1734,PFE,"The report set Wall Street abuzz with speculation. AstraZeneca, unlike some of its rivals, is still falling off the patent cliff, and its earnings are expected to keep declining through 2017, leading many industry observers to see it as a buyout target.

"
1751,PFE,"2014: A Look Back And AheadThe top of Chipotle Mexican Grill 's (CMG) menu could easily headline a tasty strategy:Keep it simple.Such is the way co-CEO Monty Moran steers his firm to the top of the fast-casual restaurant segment.""It's simple, really,"" he told IBD. ""Better-quality food tastes better, and really great people make better food and provide a better customer experience.""Its menu is simple. So is its restaurant format, making it easy for patrons to get served fast when lines stretch out the door.It's hard to believe that Chipotle is still in the early stages of growth, but that's exactly the case. It operates about 1,600 restaurants in America, with a small presence internationally — in Canada, England, France and Germany.That domestic focus will continue in 2014, with the firm planning to open 180 to 195 units. ""There's room for thousands more restaurants in the U.S.,"" Moran said.Moran is looking at 2014 the same way he's looked at every year since he was appointed to the post by founder and co-CEO Steve Ells in January 2009.""There's a sense of increased optimism,"" Moran, 47, said. ""While I can't predict exactly what the economy is going to do in 2014, I know that we have loyal customers. This, along with great food and a sound unit economic model, will keep us on track regardless of what the economy is doing.""Moran has proved he's committed to changing food culture — while he's overseen a 1,000% stock shot the past five years, including a 79% advance in 2013.Digging InChipotle has shown it can execute during tough economic times. Moran pointed out that during the depths of the recession in 2008-09, the chain was the last to succumb to economic weakness and the first to benefit when the economy started to improve.""Our comps held up longer than anyone's during the last recession,"" Moran said. ""And they got stronger earlier coming out.""In 2008, when most other firms showed annual earnings declines, annual profit at Chipotle rose 11% from 2007. In 2009, annual earnings jumped 67%.In 2014, the company is expected to open more ShopHouse SouthEast Asian Kitchen locations. It now operates six — three in Washington, D.C., three in Los Angeles.Then there's pizza. Expect Chipotle to make noise in that arena after its recently announced partnership with Pizzeria Locale in Denver, where Chipotle is headquartered.CEOs are necessarily fixated on the bottom line, but Moran learned early on that worrying about profit doesn't generate profit.""You'll never hear me talking about profits or getting sales up,"" Moran said. ""We tell people to make great burritos and provide great restaurant experiences. The rest will take care of itself.""Chipotle's food costs are high — usually a drag for restaurants — but in 2012 annual pretax margin hit an all-time high of 16.8%.Robust sales have a lot to do with it. In October, Chipotle reported a 6.2% increase in same-store sales, beating analysts' expectations of 4.8% same-store sales growth. The company's restaurants open for at least a year average $2.1 million in sales per year.R.J. Hottovy, a senior restaurant analyst at Morningstar, thinks the fast-casual space could have another solid year in 2014: ""Chipotle is one of the more intriguing concepts to emerge out of the restaurant space over the last decade. They've pioneered and perfected the fast-casual concept, which has become the sweet spot in the industry. It's more cost-efficient to run than a casual dining location.""As Chipotle cooks up more ideas for 2014, Moran again keeps it simple: ""If you look at innovation as new menu items, new dollar menu items and value meals, we're the least innovative."" The way his company improves is via better raw ingredients, sharp cooking methods and making sure restaurant teams are the best they can be. ""The goal is to empower top-performing people to achieve high standards.""In sports, athletes' greatness is measured by how they make teammates better. So it is with Chipotle's people culture. Individual store managers, called restaurateurs, are the most important employees, said Moran: ""We evaluate our leaders based on how powerfully they make the people around them better. It's not good enough at Chipotle to be good at what you do. You have to make people better too. The goal is to create a situation where employees feel confident in their abilities and encouraged by their circumstances so they feel like they can be at their best.""Moran's way of communicating came in part from studying communications at the University of Colorado, where he graduated in 1988.Then it was on to law school at Pepperdine University in Southern California, where he graduated in 1993. Wanting to be a trial lawyer, he joined Morris Polich & Purdy in Los Angeles and zeroed in on small cases so he could develop into a prime attorney.Three years later he moved back to Colorado and joined Messner Reeves.In the meantime, Moran walked down the aisle. He and Kathy have been married 17 years and have three children.Moran rose through the Messner Reeves ranks fast, becoming a partner in just two years and CEO soon thereafter.Much of Chipotle's culture comes from Moran's experience at Messner Reeves. He was all about delegating, which helped create a stable of empowered lawyers who worked hard to satisfy clients.So how does a trial lawyer ascend to co-chief executive at one of the world's most robust restaurants?Moran and Ells were high school classmates and became friendlier during Monty's college days. Moran would catch dinner at Ells' house, where Steve served up gourmet, scrumptious food.One night he had the pleasure of trying an Ells burrito. Monty was stunned at how delicious it was and heard from his pal that he planned to open a restaurant and serve them.Moran didn't need convincing. He started doing legal work for Chipotle in the mid-1990s in the early stages of the company's expansion, mostly working on leases.On BoardChipotle was so impressive, McDonald's (MCD) expressed an interest in buying it in 1998.After making an investment in the Denver-based chain, the Big Mac team sent its general counsel, Jeff Kindler, to review Messner Reeves' legal work.Kindler and Moran hit it off. The counsel could see Moran's passion for his work and promptly sent a memo up the McDonald's chain with this recommendation: Retain Messner Reeves for all Chipotle legal work.Moran didn't forget. After Kindler's run as CEO of Pfizer (PFE), he eventually joined Chipotle's board.Finally, in March 2005, Moran accepted a position as president and chief operating officer with Ells' company and became co-CEO on Jan. 1, 2009. ""I told Steve I wasn't sure how I was qualified to be CEO,"" Moran said.Ells' answer: The position was more about Moran than the title and that he'd figure it out.Said Moran: ""I remember Steve telling me, 'Monty, the thing you're best at is leading people. The lawyer part is secondary. You lead a successful law firm with 50-60 employees. What about coming to a place with 8,000 employees?'""The challenge appealed to Moran, who shares this lesson: ""I realized that leadership was a more valuable trait than being a top-notch trial lawyer.""

1761,PFE,"In recent decades, high cholesterol has been Big Pharma's gravy train. The statins, oral drugs that lower ""bad"" cholesterol, turned into the best-selling drugs in history, with Pfizer's Lipitor peaking at nearly $14 billion in 2006 sales.
"
1762,PFE,"Now, however, all the statins have gone off-patent or are about to. So Pfizer (PFE) and a passel of other companies — led by Amgen (AMGN), Regeneron (REGN) and Regeneron's partner Sanofi (SNY) — are turning to a new class of cholesterol busters called PCSK9 inhibitors.
"
1763,PFE,"At the American Cardiology Conference (ACC) in Washington, D.C., Saturday through Monday, investors will get a chance to see how the new drugs are doing in clinical trials.
"
1764,PFE,"PCSK9 is short for proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, an enzyme that binds to the liver's receptors of LDL, or bad, cholesterol and targets them for degredation. By blocking PCSK9, the companies aim to boost the liver's ability to eliminate LDL cholesterol from the blood, and thus reduce the chance of heart disease.
"
1765,PFE,"All the PCSK9 inhibitors in mid- or late-stage testing are monoclonal antibodies, a biotechnology that's already been used for best-selling cancer and immunology drugs.
"
1766,PFE,"Monthly Injections
"
1767,PFE,"All of the drugs also have to be injected once or twice a month, which makes them somewhat more unpleasant to take than statins. Partly for that reason, drugmakers are gunning for subgroups of high-cholesterol sufferers for whom statins aren't adequate.
"
1768,PFE,"""The majority of patients in our program are treated with statins, normally at the highest tolerable dose,"" said Jay Edelberg, head of Sanofi's PCSK9 development and launch unit. ""These are primarily the patients who are familial hypercholesterolemics — the genetic disorder — or those who've either had a (cardiovascular) event or are diabetics and are at high risk for cardiovascular disease.
"
1769,PFE,"""Then there are the patients who can't tolerate the statins.""
"
1770,PFE,"Morningstar analyst Stefan Quenneville estimates those descriptions cover about 4.4 million people in the U.S., and he expects that will grow by another million by 2022. A roughly equivalent number of potential patients also live abroad, he estimates.
"
1771,PFE,"Regeneron's and Sanofi's drug alirocumab will take the most stage time at the ACC meeting, with presentations detailing data from five of the 14 clinical trials being conducted on the product. These include studies of patients with genetic high cholesterol, patients who are taking Merck's (MRK) Zetia or AbbVie's (ABBV) Tricor and those who aren't, as well as a comparison of patients on Zetia alone vs. those on alirocumab alone.
"
1772,PFE,"The companies expect to file for approval of alirocumab in early 2015. So does Amgen, which is also conducting 14 different late-stage clinical trials of its candidate evolocumab.
"
1773,PFE,"Amgen will be giving five presentations on evolocumab, comparing it with Zetia and with statins, as well as its effectiveness in statin-intolerant subjects and in patients with one kind of genetic hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous). On March 17, it reported that a study of homozygous patients had met its endpoints, but didn't say when or where further details would be revealed.
"
1774,PFE,"Pfizer is a bit behind Regeneron and Amgen with its bococizumab, since it just launched a phase three program in October. It's scheduled to present a dose-ranging study of patients on statins at ACC.
"
1775,PFE,"Analysts have been pleased with the trial results of these drugs so far, but they haven't converged around a favorite the way they did during the recent hepatitis C race, for instance. That's because there hasn't been much in the data to differentiate one from the other, says Quenneville.
"
1776,PFE,"Looking At Safety Issues
"
1777,PFE,"""I think any of the trials (presented at ACC) are going to be interesting, because at this point the drugs have been pretty similar,"" Quenneville told IBD. ""What I'm looking for, more than differences in efficacy, is anything to do with safety.
"
1778,PFE,"""I think that's going to be the major concern — if some safety signal appears that we didn't see in smaller trials. That could waylay specific drugs, or even the entire class of drugs.""
"
1779,PFE,"The safety of the PCSK9s came under particular scrutiny earlier this month, when word got around Twitter that the Food and Drug Administration ""has become aware of neurocognitive adverse events in the PCSK9 inhibitor class"" and had asked Sanofi and Regeneron to ""make an assessment of potential neurocognitive adverse events across the global development program for alirocumab, especially in the longer-term studies,"" according to Sanofi's annual report.
"
1780,PFE,"As it turned out, the other PCSK9 players had gotten the same letter. All denied they had found any significant safety issues.
"
1781,PFE,"Analysts, however, seem to have settled on evolocumab as the culprit, since a 409-member cohort in its Osler trial included four people who reported memory impairment, and one with amnesia.
"
1782,PFE,"ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum, however, points out that most of these patients were also on statins, and memory loss has been connected with statins, so it's not clear if evolocumab was to blame.
"
1783,PFE,"If safety turns out to be no problem, Quenneville estimates PCSK9 drugs could collectively sell more than $7 billion in 2022. He assumes that alirocumab and evolocumab will split most of the market due to being first out. But he says Pfizer might yet have something up its sleeve.
"
1784,PFE,"""Pfizer has implied in one conference call that they had a more potent (PCSK9), and in their phase two they discontinued (some patients) because some people had dramatic lowering,"" he said. ""We'll see — there's not really enough data to tease that out at this point.""In recent decades, high cholesterol has been Big Pharma's gravy train. The statins, oral drugs that lower ""bad"" cholesterol, turned into the best-selling drugs in history, with Pfizer's Lipitor peaking at nearly $14 billion in 2006 sales.Now, however, all the statins have gone off-patent or are about to.

Partly for that reason, drugmakers are gunning for subgroups of high-cholesterol sufferers for whom statins aren't adequate.""The majority of patients in our program are treated with statins, normally at the highest tolerable dose,"" said Jay Edelberg, head of Sanofi's PCSK9 development and launch unit. ""These are primarily the patients who are familial hypercholesterolemics — the genetic disorder — or those who've either had a (cardiovascular) event or are diabetics and are at high risk for cardiovascular disease.""Then there are the patients who can't tolerate the statins.""Morningstar analyst Stefan Quenneville estimates those descriptions cover about 4.4 million people in the U.S., and he expects that will grow by another million by 2022. A roughly equivalent number of potential patients also live abroad, he estimates.Regeneron's and Sanofi's drug alirocumab will take the most stage time at the ACC meeting, with presentations detailing data from five of the 14 clinical trials being conducted on the product. These include studies of patients with genetic high cholesterol, patients who are taking Merck's (MRK) Zetia or AbbVie's (ABBV) Tricor and those who aren't, as well as a comparison of patients on Zetia alone vs. those on alirocumab alone.The companies expect to file for approval of alirocumab in early 2015. So does Amgen, which is also conducting 14 different late-stage clinical trials of its candidate evolocumab.Amgen will be giving five presentations on evolocumab, comparing it with Zetia and with statins, as well as its effectiveness in statin-intolerant subjects and in patients with one kind of genetic hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous). On March 17, it reported that a study of homozygous patients had met its endpoints, but didn't say when or where further details would be revealed.Pfizer is a bit behind Regeneron and Amgen with its bococizumab, since it just launched a phase three program in October. It's scheduled to present a dose-ranging study of patients on statins at ACC.Analysts have been pleased with the trial results of these drugs so far, but they haven't converged around a favorite the way they did during the recent hepatitis C race, for instance. That's because there hasn't been much in the data to differentiate one from the other, says Quenneville.Looking At Safety Issues""I think any of the trials (presented at ACC) are going to be interesting, because at this point the drugs have been pretty similar,"" Quenneville told IBD. ""What I'm looking for, more than differences in efficacy, is anything to do with safety.""I think that's going to be the major concern — if some safety signal appears that we didn't see in smaller trials. That could waylay specific drugs, or even the entire class of drugs.""The safety of the PCSK9s came under particular scrutiny earlier this month, when word got around Twitter that the Food and Drug Administration ""has become aware of neurocognitive adverse events in the PCSK9 inhibitor class"" and had asked Sanofi and Regeneron to ""make an assessment of potential neurocognitive adverse events across the global development program for alirocumab, especially in the longer-term studies,"" according to Sanofi's annual report.As it turned out, the other PCSK9 players had gotten the same letter. All denied they had found any significant safety issues.Analysts, however, seem to have settled on evolocumab as the culprit, since a 409-member cohort in its Osler trial included four people who reported memory impairment, and one with amnesia.ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum, however, points out that most of these patients were also on statins, and memory loss has been connected with statins, so it's not clear if evolocumab was to blame.If safety turns out to be no problem, Quenneville estimates PCSK9 drugs could collectively sell more than $7 billion in 2022. He assumes that alirocumab and evolocumab will split most of the market due to being first out. But he says Pfizer might yet have something up its sleeve.""Pfizer has implied in one conference call that they had a more potent (PCSK9), and in their phase two they discontinued (some patients) because some people had dramatic lowering,"" he said. ""We'll see — there's not really enough data to tease that out at this point.""

1812,PFE,"Beleaguered BlackBerry (BBRY) is scheduled to report quarterly earnings before the open Friday, with revenue projected to fall 44% from the year-earlier period.It would be the eighth double-digit drop in the last nine quarters.Not all analysts have entirely thrown in the towel on BlackBerry, a pioneer and former leader in the smartphone market prior to the arrival of the Apple (AAPL) iPhone and Google (GOOG) Android handsets.Analyst Brian Blair at Wedge Partners, in ""an open letter to BlackBerry management"" issued Thursday, talked about an opportunity path even though ""Wall Street believes you're dead.""The only way for BlackBerry to survive, he wrote, is to abandon the high end of the market and attack the low end with vigor.""If you stay on the path you've been on, Blackberry will end with all of the various parts of the company getting chopped up and sold to the highest bidder,"" he wrote.""The high end (smartphone market) is slowing; the low end is where the growth is,"" Blair wrote. And while profit on the low end is slim and the competition fierce, ""it's the only place you have a shot of selling units. Over time, you may be able to move upstream to the midtier market.""Once a favorite among corporate and government customers, as the first company to come up with a secure mobile email system, BlackBerry has seen its market share slide ever since the introduction of the iPhone in 2007, followed by Google's introduction of the Android open-source mobile operating system.Pfizer (PFE), one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, recently told its BlackBerry users to switch to an iPhone or Android-based handset when their wireless contracts permit an upgrade, as IBD reported.Just what direction BlackBerry intends to go should come into sharper view when it reports earnings Friday. Early last month, BlackBerry shelved plans to go private, replaced CEO Thorsten Heins and said it was taking a $1 billion investment from Fairfax Financial Holdings in exchange for convertible debt, as IBD reported. Heins was replaced by John Chen, the former CEO of Sybase, as interim CEO.In a press release announcing the CEO transition, Chen said, ""BlackBerry is an iconic brand with enormous potential — but it's going to take time, discipline and tough decisions to reclaim our success.""BlackBerry will be reporting results for its fiscal Q3 ended Nov. 30. Analyst consensus estimate is revenue of $1.6 billion, down from $2.7 billion in the year-earlier quarter but up 2% from the previous quarter. The consensus estimates on earnings per share, minus items, is a loss of 44 cents, widening from a loss of 22 cents. It would be the seventh quarter in a row in the red.""We look for an updated plan from Chen to salvage BlackBerry's lucrative services business by shifting to an open platform while managing its devices business to a break-even point,"" wrote Mark McKechnie, an analyst at Evercore Group, in a research report.

1900,PFE,"The biggest news this week was Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) announcement of its plans to re-organize its business into three new segments, effective next year. J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report) was ordered by a St Louis jury to pay approximately $4.7 billion to nearly two dozen women in a lawsuit related to its talc-based products. Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) and Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) provided updates on their cancer drugs.Pfizer to Re-Organize Business Units: Pfizer is re-organizing its business into three business segments, separating its consumer healthcare business into a standalone unit. Beginning 2019, Pfizer will report under three new business units — Innovative Medicines, Established Medicines and Consumer Healthcare. Presently, Pfizer has two reporting segments namely Innovative Health and Essential Health.The present Innovative Health unit will be called the Innovative Medicines unit and will now include biosimilars and a new hospital business unit for anti-infectives and sterile injectables — both of which are presently reported under Essential Health. The Essential Health unit will now be renamed to Established Medicines. This unit will include Pfizer’s legacy brands that have lost or will lose market exclusivity. (Read more: Pfizer to Reorganize Business Into Three New Units)J&J to Pay $4.7 Billion in Talc Lawsuit: J&J was ordered by a jury in a St. Louis court to pay $4.69 billion in damages to 22 women who alleged that its talc-based products, including its baby powders, contained asbestos, which caused them to develop ovarian cancer. The damages comprised $550 million in compensatory damages and $4.14 billion in punitive damages. J&J, in an official statement, said the verdict was unfair and it would appeal against it. It also said its talc products neither contained asbestos nor caused cancer. J&J faces more than 9,000 cases for its talc products. Trump Slams Pfizer for Price Hikes; Pfizer Defers Increases: In a tweet, President Donald Trump slammed Pfizer for raising prices of several of its prescription drugs, effective from Jul 1. Trump said Pfizer and other U.S. drugmakers should be “ashamed” that they had raised drug prices for “no reason.” The tweet also said that by raising drug prices in the United States, these drug companies were offering “bargain basement prices” overseas. He warned that the administration will respond. A day after this tweet was published, Pfizer issued a statement saying it will defer the price increases until the President’s drug pricing blueprint goes into effect or until the end of the year, whichever is earlier. AbbVie’s Imbruvica Lymphoma Study Fails: AbbVie announced that a late-stage study evaluating its cancer drug Imbruvica for the first-line treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) failed to meet the primary endpoint.The study evaluated the addition of Imbruvica to R-CHOP (combination of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone), which is the existing standard of care for DLBCL, an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) versus R-CHOP plus placebo. However, the study data showed that adding Imbruvica to R-CHOP did not improve event-free survival (EFS) in the targeted patient population. Imbruvica is presently FDA approved for eight indications including five B-cell blood cancers, as well as in chronic graft-versus-host-disease. The drug, which AbbVie markets in partnership with J&J, recorded sales of $762 million in the first quarter of 2018. This included U.S. sales of $624 million, up 36.7%, and $138 million (up 47.2%) of international profit sharing with J&J.AbbVie also filed a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) to the FDA for a label expansion of Venclexta (venetoclax) for the first-line treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).  AbbVie is looking to get Venclexta approved in combination with a hypomethylating agent (“HMA”) or with low-dose cytarabine (“LDAC”) in AML patients who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. (Read more: AbbVie's Imbruvica Fails in Phase III Blood Cancer Study)Merck’s Keytruda sBLA Gets Priority Review: Merck’s supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) looking to expand the label of Keytruda for previously treated patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver cancer, was granted priority review by the FDA.

1901,PFE,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that it is re-organizing its business into three business segments, separating its consumer healthcare business into a standalone unit. Beginning 2019, Pfizer will report under three new business units — Innovative Medicines, Established Medicines and Consumer Healthcare. Presently, Pfizer has two reporting segments — Innovative Health and Essential Health.The present Innovative Health unit will be called Innovative Medicines. Other than including all the current Innovative Health business units, Innovative Medicines will include a new Hospital Medicines business unit created for sterile injectable and anti-infective medicines, which are presently recorded under Pfizer’s Essential Health unit. Also, biosimilars will now be included under the Oncology and Inflammation & Immunology business segments in the Innovative Medicines unit.The Essential Health unit will be renamed to Established Medicines. This unit will continue to include Pfizer’s legacy brands that have lost or will lose market exclusivity including Lyrica, Lipitor, Norvasc and Viagra, and certain generic medicines. While Lipitor, Norvasc and Viagra have already lost patent exclusivity, Lyrica is expected to lose the same in December this year.Pfizer expects a significant reduction in the impact of patent protection losses post-2020 (after Lyrica’s loss of exclusivity). Last year, Pfizer had said that while loss of exclusivities (LOE) hurt 2017 sales by $2.1 billion, the negative impact will go down to about $2 billion in each of the next three years (through 2020). The LOE impact will reduce further post 2020 and will go down to approximately $1 billion in 2021.  It will not be more than $500 million from 2022 through 2025. With potentially lower LOE impact, Pfizer is optimistic that the Established Medicines unit can generate sustainable modest revenue growth. The Consumer Healthcare unit, which was until now a part of Innovative Health, will include all of Pfizer’s over-the-counter drugs. Pfizer is exploring strategic alternatives for its Consumer Healthcare segment including a partial of a full separation through a spin-off, sale or other transaction. A decision regarding the same is expected to be made this year and Pfizer may ultimately opt to retain the business.Pfizer is having a tough time finding a buyer for its Consumer Healthcare segment, In March, British companies Reckitt Benckiser Group and Glaxo (GSK  -  Free Report) pulled out of the discussion with Pfizer to buy its Consumer Health segment. Some investors believe the split can make the sale easier. Some also speculate that Pfizer may sell its generics unit in a couple of years.The news of business re-organization comes a day after Pfizer deferred its recent price increases of several prescription drugs after being criticized by Trump. There are concerns that price hike by one company may soon trigger a market-wide increase in prices by drugmakers like J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and others.This year so far, Pfizer’s shares have increased 2.7% against a decrease of 1.4% for the industry.Pfizer currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1902,PFE,"Innovation holds the key in the pharma/biotech sector and most companies have been diverting their resources to develop gene therapy candidates in their goal of finding a cure for difficult and incurable diseases.  In the first half of 2018, most pharma/biotech bigwigs and also a number of smaller companies scurried for a lucrative catch in the space either through licensing deals or acquisitions. In particular, the FDA approval of Luxturna, a new gene therapy for the treatment of children and adult patients with an inherited form of vision loss that may result in blindness in December 2017, sparked interest in the space. What is Gene Therapy?Gene therapy enables to mitigate the adverse effects of a malfunctioning disease-causing gene. The therapy intends to add a functional gene in a person's system, replacing the malfunctioning one to cure diseases. The gene is delivered to a cell though a carrier known as vector.  The  therapy has a different approach from the traditional drug therapies as the underlying cause can be treated with it unlike symptoms.Gene therapy is set to become one of the most promising spaces in the volatile biotech sector, which continues to grapple with competitive pressure and pricing woes. The promising therapy is being evaluated for varied diseases such as hemophilia, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), Parkinson's disease and cancer among others.Recent Activity in the SpaceThe year started with the acquisition of AveXis, Inc by Swiss giant Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report). AveXis’ lead product candidate, AVXS-101, is being evaluated as a one-time gene replacement therapy for spinal muscular atrophy, a disease that results in early death or life-long disability with considerable healthcare costs. Novartis is trying to develop a gene therapy portfolio. In January 2018, Novartis signed a license and commercialization agreement for the development and commercialization of voretigene neparvovec (brand name Luxturna in the United States) outside the United States with Spark Therapeutics.Thereafter, this space has seen a lot of activity.  Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) initiated a phase Ib clinical trial for its mini-dystrophin gene therapy candidate, PF-06939926, in boys with DMD. Solid Biosciences (SLDB  -  Free Report) too was in the news recently after the company announced that the FDA had lifted the clinical hold on lead candidate, SGT-001, a microdystrophin gene transfer evaluated for the treatment of DMD. The FDA recently granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation to Voyager Therapeutics’ VY-AADC gene therapy treatment for Parkinson’s disease in patients with motor fluctuations that are refractory to medical management.Stocks to Watch Out ForGiven the potential the market holds, a number of companies have started to develop the therapy with several of them having promising candidates in their pipeline.Axovant Sciences (AXON  -  Free Report) is one such company, which has been steadily developing its pipeline of candidates using gene therapy through licensing deals. The company is focused on developing its gene therapy product candidate, AXO-Lenti-PD, as a one-time treatment for Parkinson’s disease.  The company intends to begin a phase I/II study of AXO-Lenti-PD in advanced Parkinson’s disease patients before the end of 2018.  The company recently announced a licensing agreement with Benitec Biopharma. Axovant licensed exclusive global rights to an experimental Silence-and-Replace gene therapy program from Benitec Biopharma for the treatment of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD). Axovant will obtain rights to AXO-AAV-OPMD, which will utilize proprietary Silence-and-Replace technology. AXO-AAV-OPMD is an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector gene therapy delivered via a one-time intramuscular administration, which silences the mutant PABPN1 gene and replaces it with a functional copy. It is currently in preclinical development stage. Axovant plans to initiate a placebo-controlled clinical study in 2019.Axovant’s stock has gained 25.8% in the last six months against the industry’s decline of 5%. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. uniQure N.V. (QURE  -  Free Report) is another promising player in the space. It is creating a pipeline of innovative gene therapies that have been developed both internally and through its collaboration, focused on cardiovascular diseases, with Bristol Myers-Squibb.The company has already enrolled its first patient in the phase III HOPE-B pivotal study of AMT-061, an experimental AAV5-based gene therapy incorporating the FIX-Padua variant for the treatment of patients with severe and moderately severe hemophilia B. The company has obtained orphan drug designation for AMT-130 for the treatment of Huntington’s disease in the United States and the European Union and holds global commercialization rights of the program.uniQure too currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. uniQure’s stock has moved up 115.7% in the last six months against the industry’s decline. Audentes Therapeutics (BOLD  -  Free Report) is another biotechnology company with a promising pipeline of innovative gene therapy products for patients living with rare diseases.  The company is currently conducting phase I/II studies for its lead product candidates — AT132 for the treatment of X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) and AT342 for the treatment of Crigler-Najjar syndrome.  The company currently has two additional product candidates in development, including AT982 for the treatment of Pompe disease and AT307 for the treatment of the CASQ2 subtype of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CASQ2-CPVT).  Last month, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted Priority Medicines (PRIME) designation to AT132 for the treatment of XLMTM.Audentes currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. Shares have gained 2.8% in the last six months. What’s Ahead?With gene therapy gaining traction, investors should keep an eye on this space as potential approvals and data read-outs from late stage trials of several companies are likely to keep the stocks on growth trajectory.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1903,PFE,"In response to President Donald Trump’s tweet on Monday, Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) said that it will defer its recent price increases of several prescription drugs maximum until the end of the year. Chief executive officer (CEO), Ian Read, announced the decision following an “extensive discussion” with the President.Last week, the New York based company had announced an increase in list prices of several drugs, effective Jul 1. This was the second time this year that Pfizer increased prices of its medicines. Pfizer raised prices of its medicines by an average of 9%, which is within the agreed limit of 10% price rise a year. However, prices of a few drugs like Xalatan, Viagra and Chanix have already increased in double digits including the January hike.Pfizer defended the price rise by stating that the list price does not reflect the actual price, which includes a discount. It also mentioned that it had hiked prices of only one-tenth of its drug portfolio and reduced prices of five drugs by 16% to 44%.In his first tweet on Monday, the President criticized Pfizer for the price increases. Trump warned that the administration will act in response and Pfizer and other U.S. drugmakers should be “ashamed” that they have raised drug prices for “no reason”. The tweet also said that by raising drug prices in the United States, these drug companies are offering “bargain basement prices” overseas.In the latest statement, Read said the prices of these medicines will return to their pre-Jul 1 levels as soon as technically possible. He also said the prices will be deferred until the President’s drug pricing blueprint goes into effect or until the end of the year, whichever is sooner. Meanwhile, the price cuts by the company will remain in effect. In a tweet on Tuesday, the President appreciated Pfizer’s decision and hoped others would follow suit.Incidentally, Pfizer’s announcement of the price hike came only a few weeks after Trump’s claim in May that pharma companies would soon take massive price cuts voluntarily. However, there have been no signs of such price cuts.Pfizer faced criticism for the price hikes as there is a concern that price hike by one company may soon trigger a market-wide increase in prices by drugmakers like J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and others.This year so far, Pfizer's shares have increased 3.3% against a decrease of 2.2% for the industry.  Pfizer currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1904,PFE,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved the label expansion of its JAK inhibitor, Xeljanz (tofacitinib), to include a new indication – moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (“UC”). The drug is approved for the treatment of adult patients with recommended a dose of 10 mg twice-daily for at least eight weeks.The approval was expected as the FDA Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee had adopted a positive vote in a meeting in March recommending the approval of the supplemental new drug application (sNDA) filed in July last year seeking label expansion of Xeljanz in UC.Xeljanz is already marketed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and active psoriatic arthritis. In the first quarter of 2018, Xeljanz sales were $326 million, up 30.4% from the year-ago period. The label expansion in the UC indication is likely to boost its sales further.Shares of Pfizer have lost 0.5% so far this year, compared with a 6% decrease for the industry it belongs to.The approval was based on data from three pivotal studies – OCTAVE Induction 1, OCTAVE Induction 2 and OCTAVE Sustain – which demonstrated that statistically significant and greater proportion of patients achieved remission when treated with Xeljanz compared to a placebo.Pfizer is currently evaluating Xeljanz in an open label long-term extension study, OCTAVE Open.However, there are several blockbuster drugs in the inflammatory segment approved for UC, which includes Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Remicade and Simponi, AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira and Shire’s (SHPG  -  Free Report) Lialda. Moreover, many biotech companies are developing their candidates for the treatment for UC. Hence, competition is likely to increase in this segment.Pfizer Inc. Price  Pfizer Inc. Price | Pfizer Inc.

1905,PFE,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to its lung cancer drug, Xalkori (crizotinib) for two new indications.Xalkori is already marketed for the treatment of ALK+ or ROS1-positive locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In-fact, it is only FDA-approved treatment indicated for both ALK-positive and ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC.The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to Xalkori for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC with MET exon 14 alterations with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. The designation for this indication was supported by results from an expansion cohort of the phase I PROFILE 1001 study, in which Xalkori showed antitumor activity.Another indication for which Breakthrough Therapy designation was granted to Xalkori was for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) that is ALKpositive. The designation for this indication was supported by two studies — Study ADVL0912 (NCT00939770) and Study A8081013 (NCT01121588).  The studies showed compelling antitumor activity in pediatric and adult patients treated with Xalkori.The designation from the FDA is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs with early evidence of substantial potential clinical benefit to patients.Shares of Pfizer have declined 1.5% year to date, compared with the industry’s decline of 6%. NSCLC is a difficult-to-treat disease, accounting for about 85% of lung cancer cases. At present, the lung cancer treatment market is highly crowded with drugs like Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo, Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda, Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Alecensa, Novartis’ Zykadia and Taxotere among others.Zacks RankPfizer has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1907,PFE,"Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) announced that its generic arm, Sandoz, obtained approval for Zessly, a biosimilar version of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report)’s Remicade, in Europe.Zessly is approved for use in all indications of the branded drug including rheumatoid arthritis, adult Crohn's disease, pediatric Crohn's disease, adult ulcerative colitis, pediatric ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis.The approval from the European Commission is based on review of a comprehensive development program, including analytical, preclinical and clinical data, which confirmed Zessly matching Remicade in terms of safety, efficacy and quality.An approval was in the cards as the CHMP had given a positive opinion on the same in March.The approval will strengthen Sandoz’s already strong biosimilar portfolio with five marketed biosimilars (Omnitrope, a human growth hormone; Binocrit, an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent used to treat anemia; and filgrastim for neutropenia under the brand names Zarzio outside the United States and Zarxio in the United States).Rixathon (biosimilar rituximab), approved in Europe in 2017 to treat blood cancers and immunological diseases (also approved in the EU as Riximyo under a duplicate marketing authorization); and Erelzi (biosimilar etanercept), approved in Europe in 2017 to treat multiple inflammatory diseases.  With Zessly’s approval, Sandoz will now have six approved biosimilars in its portfolio. Zessly is the third biosimilar which has been approved by the EC in the last 12 months for Sandoz.The FDA also approved biosimilar Erelzi in 2016. However, the launch is pending in the United States due to an ongoing litigation with Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report).We note that Sandoz acquired the biosimilar of infliximab from Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) in February 2016 for the 28 EU countries plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein that form the European Economic Area.Novartis’ shares have declined 2.6% over a year, compared with the industry’s fall of 5.5%. However, Sandoz continues to face pricing pressure and sales are projected to decline in the upcoming quarters.Zacks RankNovartis carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1908,PFE,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to its rare disease candidate, tafamidis. The candidate is being developed for the treatment of transthyretin cardiomyopathy (TTR-CM).The designation from the FDA is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs with early evidence of substantial potential clinical benefit to patients, or benefit patients without current treatment options.The designation for tafamadis was primarily based on encouraging top-line data from the phase III ATTR-ACT study, which demonstrated significant reduction in the combination of all-cause mortality and frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations in TTR-CM patients.The candidate also enjoys fast track status and orphan drug designation for this indication in the United States.Shares of Pfizer have declined 0.7% so far this year, comparing favorably with a 4% decrease for the industry.  TTR-CM is a rare disease associated with progressive heart failure and is universally fatal. Presently, no treatment is approved to treat this fatal disease. According to Pfizer’s press release, less than 1% of people with the disease are diagnosed with life expectancy averaging three to five years from diagnosis.There are two types of TTR-CM, a hereditary form and a wild-type form of the disease, which is not hereditary. The ATTR-ACT study included both types of patients. However, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY  -  Free Report) and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS  -  Free Report) have developed their candidates, patisiran and inotersen, respectively, for hereditary TTR amyloidosis, or hATTR. Both patisiran and inotersen are under review in the EU and United States and could be launched this year.Tafamidis is already approved for the treatment of transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP) in 40 countries except the United States.Pfizer Inc.

1909,PFE,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted priority review to a supplemental new drug application (sBLA) for its PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda.With the latest filing, Merck is looking to get Keytruda approved for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a form of liver cancer in patients, previously treated with systemic therapy (sorafenib).The FDA is expected to give its verdict on Nov 9, 2018.The sBLA was based on positive data from the phase II study KEYNOTE-224. The outcomes demonstrated that treatment with Keytruda monotherapy led to an overall response rate (ORR) of 16.3% in patients with advanced HCC. The data also showed a 1% complete response rate and a 15.4% partial response rate as a result of treatment with Keytruda.This data was recently produced at the 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Cancers Symposium in San Francisco.Notably, Keytruda is already marketed for several cancer indications including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical hodgkin lymphoma and bladder cancer. The drug is the first anti-PD-1 therapy to gain an FDA approval and is now already approved for use in 10 different settings involving seven different tumor types. In 2018, it has already secured an FDA nod for two new indications. These include third-line treatment of adult as well as pediatric patients with primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and second-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer.The drug is also being studied for more than 30 types of cancer in more than 700 trials including in excess of 400 combination studies. Merck is collaborating with several companies like Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), Incyte, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) separately for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens.Keytruda is a key top-line driver for Merck and logged sales of $1.5 billion in first-quarter 2018, up 12.9% sequentially and 151% year over year. Sales continue to be driven by the launch of new indications globally.The company is carrying out the Keytruda development program, which is progressing well with several regulatory decisions for new indications in the United States as well as in Europe expected in 2018. These label expansions, if approved, will widen the patient population base and further drive the sales higher.Shares of Merck have increased 10% year to date versus the industry’s decline of 1.4%. Merck currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1910,PFE,"AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) announced that the Japanese regulatory authorities have granted approval to its PARP inhibitor, Lynparza tablets for the treatment of patients with unresectable or recurrent BRCA-mutated metastatic breast cancer in patients who have received prior chemotherapy. With this approval, Lynparza becomes the first and only PARP inhibitor approved for use beyond ovarian cancer in Japan. This is the second indication for which Lynparza is now approved in Japan. Lynparza was approved for the first indication — advanced ovarian cancer regardless of BRCA mutation status — in the country earlier this year.AstraZeneca’s shares have risen 0.3% so far this year. In contrast, the industry has declined 5.1%.In United States, Lynparza was approved for a breast cancer indication this January.Lynparza is also presently marketed for advanced ovarian cancer in later settings.Lynparza is also in different studies for a range of tumor types including breast, prostate and pancreatic cancers as well as earlier-line settings for ovarian cancer.In the first quarter of 2018, Lynparza sales rose 100% to $119 million. Sales in the United States surged 144%, gaining from recent label expansion approvals in ovarian cancer, tablets, and breast cancer indication. In Europe, sales rose 44%, pushed higher by a number of successful launches, high BRCA-testing rates and encouraging levels of reimbursement.AstraZeneca has a joint development and collaboration agreement with Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) for Lynparza.AstraZeneca’s another cancer drug Imfinzi was also approved in Japan for an early-stage lung cancer indication. The PD-L1 inhibitor was approved for patients with locally-advanced, unresectable (stage III) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), whose disease has not progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy concurrent with radiation therapy (CRT).The approval was based on positive progression free survival data from the phase III PACIFIC study.Imfinzi is already approved in the United States, Canada, Switzerland and India in this indication while an application in the EU is under review, with a decision expected in the second half.Meanwhile, Imfinzi (durvalumab) is being evaluated for multiple cancers, either alone or in combination with other regimens, including late-stage studies in combination with tremelimumab in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, liver cancer), NSCLC, small cell lung cancer, metastatic urothelial cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) among others.Imfinzi was launched in the United States for the first indication — second-line advanced bladder cancer — in May last year. Thereafter, Imfinzi was approved and immediately launched for early-stage lung cancer in the United States in February this year, which contributed significantly to the drug’s $62 million sales in the first quarter of 2018.AstraZeneca has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Better-ranked large-cap pharma stocks include Pfizer, Inc.

1911,PFE,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that a phase III study evaluating its epilepsy drugLyrica (pregabalin) in pediatric patients met the primary endpoint. The study was evaluating the use of Lyrica Oral Solution CV as adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures in pediatric epilepsy patients one month to less than four years of age, an indication for which Lyrica is not yet approved.Top-line results from the study showed that adjunctive treatment with Lyrica 14 mg/kg/day resulted in a statistically significant reduction in seizure frequency versus placebo which was the primary efficacy endpoint. However, treatment with Lyrica at lower dose of 7 mg did not result in statistically significant reduction in seizure frequency versus placebo.These data along with the data from previous studies will be submitted to the FDA for Lyrica pediatric exclusivity determination.Lyrica has already lost patent exclusivity in Europe, Russia, Turkey, Israel and Central Asia. In the United States, a favorable court decision in July 2012 regarding generic challenges should protect Lyrica from genericization through Dec 30, 2018.Meanwhile, Pfizer is pursuing a six-month patent-term extension from the FDA for pediatric exclusivity, which, if granted, will keep generic competition at bay till June 2019. We believe that the positive data from the pediatric study may ease Pfizer’s effort to get pediatric exclusivity.Other than epilepsy, Lyrica is indicated to treat post-herpetic neuralgia and diabetic peripheral neuropathy, fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain due to spinal cord injury in the United States. Lyrica is also indicated to treat partial onset seizures in patients four years of age and older. Sales of Lyrica declined 1% to $1.13 billion in the first quarter of 2018.   Shares of Pfizer have lost 1.5% year to date compared with industry’s decline of 3.8%.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderPfizer has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)Some better-ranked stocks from the same space worth considering are Illumina, Inc.

1913,PFE,"The healthcare sector is in the spotlight again due to exorbitant drug pricing. President Donald Trump, in a tweet on Monday, criticized pharmaceutical giant, Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) for its recent price increases of several prescription drugs.Last week, the New York based company announced an increase in list prices of several drugs. This is the second time this year that Pfizer has increased prices of its medicines. Pfizer raised prices of its medicines by an average of 9% which is within the agreed limit of 10% price rise a year. However, prices of a few drugs like Xalatan, Viagra and Chanix have already increased in double digits including the January hike.Pfizer defended the price rise by stating that the list price does not reflect the actual price, which includes a discount. It also mentioned that it has hiked prices of only one-tenth of its drug portfolio and reduced prices of five drugs by 16% to 44%.Pfizer’s announcement of the price hike came only a few weeks after Trump’s claim in May that pharma companies would soon take massive price cuts voluntarily. However, there have been no signs of such price cuts.Pfizer faced criticism for the price hikes as there is a concern that price hike by one company may soon trigger a market-wide increase in drug prices by other pharma bigwigs like Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), J&J and others.In his latest tweet, Trump warned that the administration will act in response and Pfizer and other U.S. drugmakers should be “ashamed” that they have raised drug prices for “no reason.” The tweet also said that by raising drug prices in the United States, these drug companies are offering “bargain basement prices” overseas.Pricing Controversy a Lingering Issue?The healthcare industry has always been in the spotlight for high drug prices. The sector, previously a Wall Street favorite, was hit hard by political rhetoric and increasing media and public focus on the high prices of drugs. The drug pricing controversy has grabbed headlines since September 2015 when several companies were criticized for overpricing drugs. These included Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report), which increased the price of EpiPen, and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. (VRX  -  Free Report), for its strategy of acquiring companies and selling their drugs at higher prices.Trump, during his election campaign, had pledged to take steps to lower prescription drug prices and ensure affordability of high-cost drugs. However, no concrete policy changes have been announced to decrease drug prices since Trump took office.To ConcludeThough the industry has been constantly warned by Trump to keep prices of drugs affordable, it is probably not doing anything about it. On his part, the President can take several steps in this direction. He can push for faster generic - cheaper “copycat” versions of the branded drugs – approval, which he is already doing. He can also ask for discounted rebates to be disclosed, put limitations on promotions/advertisements of the drugs, and   mandate Medicare to negotiate drug prices with the manufacturers.It is high time drug companies take steps to provide relief to consumers by keeping cost of medicines affordable. Until then, the drug pricing controversy will remain an overhang on the space.Though Pfizer’s shares did take a dip after Trump’s tweet, it closed the day in the green.Pfizer currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1914,PFE,"The Dow snapped a record streak of wins to traverse a turbulent week. Trade-war related concerns continued to weigh on investors with President Trump expressing doubts over the success of upcoming negotiations with China. Additionally, the spike in 10-year Treasury yield also spooked markets, sparking off fresh inflationary concerns. Such fears were also stoked by encouraging retail sales numbers.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow increased 0.4% on last Friday, marking its seventh straight session of gains. This was the blue-chip index’s longest winning streak since Nov. 8, 2017. Notably, healthcare stocks were down initially following the news that President Trump unveiled his new healthcare plan.However, the broad market recovered later after the announcement was not followed up by stringent measures.

1915,PFE,"Roche Holding AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced encouraging interim data from a phase III study – IMpower150 – evaluating Tecentriq combination regimen for the first-line treatment of metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (""NSCLC""). Data showed that its immuno-oncology drug, Tecentriq, in combination with its another blockbuster cancer drug Avastin plus carboplatin and paclitaxel, significantly improved median overall survival (“OS”) rate by 4.5 months compared to Avastin plus chemotherapies.The Tecentriq combination regimen showed survival benefit in key lung cancer populations such as people with EGFR- and ALK-positive mutations and those with liver metastases and those with varying levels of PD-L1 expression.In November last year, Roche’s IMpower 150 study met the co-primary endpoint of progression free survival (“PFS”) benefit. In March this year Roche announced that the study also met its another primary endpoint of median OS. However, Roche did not provide any OS numbers.Detailed data from the study will be presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (""ASCO"") early next month.We remind investors that the combination regimen is already under priority review in the United States for this indication in the first-line setting. A supplemental Biologics License Application was filed based on PFS and OS data from the IMpower 150 study. A decision is expected on Sep 5, 2018. The positive data from the IMpower150 study is likely to boost prospects of a favorable decision by the FDA. The drug is approved for NSCLC in second-line setting.We note that Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda is the only immuno-oncology drug approved alone or in combination with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin for treating NSCLC patients in first-line setting.Shares of Roche have lost 10.3% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 4%.The IMpower150 study consisted of three cohorts, evaluating Tecentriq in combination with Avastin, carboplatin and paclitaxel, Tecentriq in combination with only carboplatin and paclitaxel, and Avastin plus carboplatin and paclitaxel in NSCLC patients. Data showed that the Tecentriq-Avastin arm achieved median OS, a co-primary endpoint, of 19.2 months compared with 14.7 months for Avastin arm.However, Tecentriq plus chemotherapies did not achieve any statistically significant improvement in OS compared to Avastin plus chemotherapies.Roche is evaluating Tecentriq as monotherapy or in combination regimens in eight late-stage studies including IMpower 150.In a separate press release, Roche announced follow-up data from the phase III ALEX study comparing Alecensa to Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xalkori (crizotinib) in treatment-naive ALK-positive NSCLC patients. Data from the study demonstrated long-term PFS benefit when treated with Alecensa with median PFS almost tripling to 34.8 months compared to 10.9 months for Xalkori.Roche Holding AG Price  Roche Holding AG Price | Roche Holding AG QuoteZacks RankRoche currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1916,PFE,"The Dow endured a turbulent week, marked by lingering trade tensions. The blue-chip index also closed below its 200-day moving average for four consecutive sessions. Conflicting signals emerged from the Trump administration on trade issues. These mixed signals led to a significant spike in volatility, with the index whipsawing during several trading sessions.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow gained 0.5% last Friday, reversing an eight-session long losing streak. This was the blue-chip index’s longest stretch of losses since March 2017 and was just one day short of its all-time longest losing streak since 1978.Gains were primarily attributable to an energy sector rally following the meeting between OPEC and Russia led consortium that took place in Vienna on Jun 22. Finally, OPEC decided to raise production quota by 624,000 barrels a day, much lower than 1.5 million barrels a day demanded by Saudi Arabia and Russia.The index declined 2% over last week, its largest weekly decline since Mar 23 as well as its second straight weekly fall. The Dow declined modestly on last Monday, as trade war fears once again escalated making investors jittery. However, markets ended sharply lower on last Tuesday, as trade war fears escalated once again.Growing fears of a U.S.-China trade war continued to take its toll on the Dow on last Wednesday and Thursday. Markets were further rattled after a Supreme Court ruling on sales tax saw shares of online retailers tumbling.The Dow This WeekThe index shed 1.3% on Monday, its biggest one-day drop since May 29, closing at its lowest level since May 4. Moreover, the Dow ended below its 200-day moving average, a psychological barrier to gauge its long-term momentum trends. Investors’ apprehensions about a trade war between the United States and China as well as with European Union continued to weigh on investor sentiment.The index gained 0.1% on Tuesday but still ended below its 200-day moving average for the second straight session.  Investors reacted cautiously as the U.S. government continues to provide mixed signals on the ongoing trade conflicts.On Jun 24, The Wall Street Journal reported that President Trump is considering restricting Chinese investment in high-tech U.S. companies. On Jun 25, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin first tweeted that the WSJ published “fake news”. However, he later clarified that restrictions will apply to all countries including China if they try to steal proprietary tech assets of U.S. companies.The Dow lost 0.7% on Wednesday, closing at its lowest level since May 3. The blue-chip index ended 165.52 points lower after touching an intraday high of 285.91 points. This reflects the index’s largest intraday downslide since Feb 21. Moreover, the Dow ended below its 200-day moving average for the third straight session.Markets opened on a positive note as President Trump stated that he has decided to strengthen the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), who will assess potential threat from Chinses investment in U.S. companies. This was a softer stand compared with Trump’s earlier decision to impose China specific investment restrictions.Later in the day, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stated the government can block any American joint venture in China if the firm transfers critical technologies to China.Moreover, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow said the Trump administration’s revised approach related to Chinese investment in the United States should not be considered as a soft stand on China. Following these two developments, stock markets took sharp downturn.The index gained 0.4% on Thursday, ending 98.46 points higher are dropping 100 points earlier in the day. Gains were largely broad-based with banks and tech stocks rallying strongly.

1917,PFE,"Shares of Pain Therapeutics, Inc. (PTIE  -  Free Report) and partner, Durect Corp. , plunged following the news that a joint meeting of the Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee, and Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee of the FDA voted 14 to 3 against the approval of pain drug, Remoxy ER.  Per the company, Remoxy is a new type of abuse-deterrent, extended-release, oral formulation of widely used opioid drug oxycodone. It is being evaluated for the management of pain, severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment, and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate.The news disappointed investors as Remoxy ER is Pain Therapeutics’ lead candidate. The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of Aug 7, 2018 for completion of its review of the New Drug Application (NDA) for Remoxy ER.The NDA is requesting label claims for abuse deterrence against three routes of abuse: injection, inhalation and nasal. Per the company, Remoxy’s thick, sticky, high viscosity formulation may deter unapproved routes of drug administration, such as injection, snorting or smoking.However, given the committee’s negative opinion on the formulation, a positive outcome from the FDA review is highly unlikely.Pain Therapeutics’ shares have lost 39.1% so far in 2018 compared to the industry’s gain of 0.4%. Shares lost 70% of their value on the above-mentioned news. We note that Pain Therapeutics has a license agreement with Durect to use the latter’s Oradur technology for Remoxy. While Pain Therapeutics is solely responsible for clinical development, Durect is responsible for furnishing suitable laboratory facilities, equipment and personnel, during pre-clinical phases of development. Both the companies are jointly responsible for certain pre-clinical activities. Pain Therapeutics is obligated to pay royalties to Durect on commercial sales of Remoxy (6.0% to 11.5%).The company had a collaboration agreement with Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) for Remoxy, which was terminated by the latter in 2014.The road to Remoxy’s development has been bumpy. It has already been issued Complete Response Letter (CRL) a few times. Most recently, in September 2016, the FDA issues a CRL, stating that Remoxy could not be approved in its present form, and specified additional actions and data is needed for drug approval. Pain Therapeutics resubmitted the Remoxy NDA in the first quarter of 2018The abuse of opioid drugs is a serious problem in the United States, with companies like Endo Pharmaceuticals (ENDP  -  Free Report) having to withdraw its injectable formulation of Opana ER.Zacks RankPain Therapeutics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1918,PFE,"Clovis Oncology, Inc. (CLVS  -  Free Report) announced that the European Medicines Agency (""EMA"") has accepted its type II variation to the marketing authorization seeking label expansion of Rubraca in Europe.We remind investors that Rubraca was approved in Europe as monotherapy for the treatment of platinum-sensitive and relapsing ovarian cancer patients with BRCA-mutation in third- or later-line setting in May. With the latest application, the company is seeking label expansion of the drug as maintenance treatment for ovarian cancer patients irrespective of BRCA-mutation and who are in a complete or partial response to platinum based chemotherapy.A potential approval for the label expansion will boost the prospect of the drug in Europe as it will reach a wider population base of patients with ovarian cancer.Rubraca is approved for the expanded indication in the United States with approval as maintenance treatment received in April.Clovis’ shares have declined 33% so far this year compared with the industry’s 6.4% decline. The regulatory application includes promising data from the confirmatory phase III study, ARIEL 3. The drug showed a significant delay in recurrence of the disease in BRCA mutant or HRD positive ovarian cancer patients in the study.Rubraca competes with AstraZeneca’s (AZN  -  Free Report) Lynparza and Tesaro, Inc.'s (TSRO  -  Free Report) Zejula. Lynparza and Zejula have an advantage over Rubraca as the drugs are already approved in patients irrespective of BRCA-mutation status.Meanwhile, an early-stage study is being conducted by Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), on its PARP inhibitor, talazoparib, in several advanced or recurrent solid tumors.The year 2018 is progressing well for Clovis with two regulatory approvals for Rubraca.The National Comprehensive Cancer Network added the drug as maintenance therapy for third or later-line setting to its clinical practice guidelines for ovarian cancer.These positive developments will certainly boost sales of the drug, driving the company’s topline going forward.Apart from these, a late-stage confirmatory study is evaluating Rubraca compared with chemotherapy on patients in third or later-line settings. The company is also developing the drug in additional indications like prostrate, breast and pancreatic cancers.Clovis Oncology, Inc. Price  Clovis Oncology, Inc. Price | Clovis Oncology, Inc.

1919,PFE,"The large cap pharmaceuticals sector comprising some of the biggest drugmakers of the world was off to a strong start in 2018. However, the sector took a backseat due to reasons like U.S. market instability and a few negative updates on the pipeline as well as regulatory front. Also, some older drugs of these companies are not performing up to the mark, inducing a drop in their revenues.The Zacks Large-Cap Pharma industry has declined 3.1% so far this year against the Zacks S&P 500 Composite’s gain of 2.6%.Overall, the sector is expected to rebound in the second half of the year. We believe, new product sales will be ramped up on the back of a rising demand, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results and frequent FDA approvals. This upside in turn,  might bring the sector back on track this year. Also, many of these companies have accelerated their cost-saving initiatives to enable investment in new products as well as defend the existing product portfolio to optimize long- and short-term growth. Cost savings can drive the earnings performance.Importantly, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity is gaining momentum with the tax reform in place. The new tax law, which cuts corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and encourages companies to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one-time tax rate of 10%, is spurring merger activity this year.With an optimistic outlook for the rest of the year, here we highlight three stocks that may prove to be good buys. All these stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and have seen their share price and earnings estimates rise in the near term. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Large Cap Pharma StocksH.

The company received positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) for the use of Cabometyx for the above indication.The EU approval in the first-line setting was based on results of the CABOSUN trial, which met its primary endpoint of improving progression-free survival compared with Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Sutent (sunitinib) in patients with previously untreated advanced RCC.Cabometyxis already marketed in the EU for advanced RCC in adults following prior vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy. In the United States, Cabometyx was approved for first-line treatment of advanced RCC in December last year, approximately two months ahead of the assigned Prescription Drug User Fee Act action date.Cabometyx generated $128.9 million net product revenues in the first quarter of 2018 driven by growth in demand following U.S. approval in the first lien setting. An approval in Europe will further boost Exelixis’ top line.Per the terms of the collaboration and license agreement with Ipsen, Exelixis will receive a milestone payment of $50 million for the EC approval, of which about $46 million was recognized as collaboration revenues in the first quarter of 2018. The payment will be made by Ipsen within the next 70 days.Exelixis’ shares have lost 32.8% over a year, wider than the industry’s decline of 3.6%.We remind investors that Exelixis entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Ipsen in February 2016 for the commercialization and further development of cabozantinib whereby Ipsen received exclusive commercialization rights for current and potential future cabozantinib indications outside the United States, Canada and Japan.Exelixis has also inked agreements with Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) and Roche Holding (RHHBY  -  Free Report) to develop cabozantinib in combination with their immunotherapy agents in 2017.Zacks Rank Exelixis has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Exelixis, Inc.

1921,PFE,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted approval to Retacrit, a biosimilar version of two blockbuster drugs – Amgen Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Epogen and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Procrit.  Pfizer already markets the biosimilar in EuropeRetracrit is indicated for the treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney disease, anemia due to Zidovudine in HIV-infected patients and anemia due to the effects of concomitant myelosuppressive chemotherapy (anemia post chemotherapy). The drug is also approved for the reduction of allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in patients undergoing elective, noncardiac, nonvascular surgery.Retacrit becomes the first biosimilar erythropoiesis-stimulating agent approved in the United States.Procrit generated sales of $972 million while Epogen’s sales were $1.1 billion in 2017. The sales numbers suggest bright prospects for Retacrit as it will be a lower cost alternative treatment option for patients using Procrit/Epogen. However, Procrit already faces biosimilar competition from drugs like Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Binocrit in Europe.Pfizer’s shares have declined 1.5% so far this year, comparing favorably with a fall of 3% recorded by the industry.The approval was supported by a comprehensive data package that demonstrated a high level of similarity of Retacrit with Epogen and Procrit. In May last year, the FDA’sadvisory committee had recommended approval of RetacritPfizer has entered into collaboration with Switzerland-based Vifor Pharma for the commercialization of Retacrit in certain channels.Retacrit is the third approved biosimilar in Pfizer’s commercial portfolio which includes Inflectra, a biosimilar version of J&J’s Remicade. The company is also developing 11 different biosimilar candidates in several mid-to-late stage studies.As the Trump administration continues to rally against exorbitantly high drug prices, the FDA has been actively approving generics/biosimilar of expensive branded drugs in a bid to bring down prices through competition. We saw several such approvals in 2017 and expect the trend to continue this year.Pfizer Inc. Price  Pfizer Inc. Price | Pfizer Inc. QuoteZacks RankPfizer currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1923,PFE,"Merck & Co. Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has accepted its supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Keytruda, an anti-PD-1 therapy, for review. The company is seeking approval of the blockbuster drug as adjuvant therapy in the treatment of patients with resected, high-risk stage III melanoma. A decision is expected by Feb 16, 2019.This year so far, Merck’s shares have outperformed the industry. Its shares have risen 8.5% in the period against the industry’s decline of 4.9%.The sBLA includes data from pivotal EORTC1325/KEYNOTE-054 study, which demonstrated that Keytruda achieved significant increase in recurrence free survival (“RFS”) after surgery compared to placebo in the patient population. Recurrence free survival was achieved in 75.4% of the patients treated with Keytruda over a year, compared to 61% for placebo. The drug also reduced the risk of disease recurrence or death by 43% over placebo.Merck has claimed that Keytruda is the first anti-PD1 therapy to achieve RFS benefit in stage IIIA, IIIB and IIIC melanoma patients. The drug has achieved RFS benefit in patients irrespective of BRAF-mutation.We remind investors that the drug is already approved for seven types of cancer indications in several settings including first-line melanoma and recently approved cervical cancer and large-cell lymphoma. Keytruda garnered sales of $1.5 billion in first-quarter 2018, up 12.9% sequentially and 151% year over year.Sales of the drug were particularly boosted by the strong momentum in the first-line lung cancer indication. It is the only approved anti-PD-1 therapy as a monotherapy or in combination with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drug, Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin.Merck is focused on further developing this successful drug in other indications.

1924,PFE,"Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) announced disappointing overall survival (OS) results from the phase III PALOMA-3 study. The study showed that the combination of Ibranceand AstraZeneca’s (AZN  -  Free Report) Faslodex (fulvestrant) failed to improve OS compared with Faslodex and placebo in women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) metastatic breast cancer whose disease has progressed after prior endocrine therapy. The study is being conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of Ibranceplus Faslodex in women with endocrine therapy-resistant metastatic breast cancer.OS was a secondary endpoint for the PALOMA-3 trial. The company stated that, as a secondary endpoint, the study was not ""optimized"" to detect a statistically significant difference in OS.The primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) was previously reported and led to the FDA approval for Ibrance plus Faslodex for pretreated women with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer. In findings published in The Lancet Oncology, the median PFS was 9.5 months with Ibrance and Faslodex compared with 4.6 months for Faslodex alone. The most common adverse reactions in PALOMA-3 included neutropenia, leukopenia, infections, fatigue and nausea; No new safety signals were identified as part of this final OS analysis.Year to date, shares of Pfizer have increased 0.4% against the industry’s decline of 4.9%. We remind investors that Ibrance had received accelerated approval from the FDA in February 2015. to be used in combination with Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Femara (letrozole) for the first-line treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (ER+/HER2-) advanced breast cancer as an initial endocrine-based therapy for their metastatic disease.Pfizer is working on expanding Ibrance’s label further by targeting different segments of breast cancer patients.

1926,PFE,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Pfizer has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13.3, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.1x. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Pfizer’s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 14.7. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Pfizer has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 12.3, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Pfizer stock in the near term too.P/CF RatioAn often-overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price/cash flow metric. This ratio doesn’t take amortization and depreciation into account, so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business. This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are (a) generally less prone to manipulation by the company’s management, and (b) are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies.The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company’s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors. However, it is not commonly used for cross-industry comparison, as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry.In this case, Pfizer’s P/CF ratio of 7.8 is lower than its industry average of 15.4, which indicates that the stock is somewhat overvalued in this respect. Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Pfizer currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This Pfizer a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Pfizer might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of D. This gives PFE a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of D. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been upbeat. The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days, while the full year estimate has seen one up in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 1.4% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched upper by 0.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Pfizer Inc. Price and Consensus   Pfizer Inc. Price and Consensus | Pfizer Inc. QuoteThis positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment, and its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term.Bottom LinePfizer is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among Bottom 23% of more than 250 industries), it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large, as you can see below: However, a Zacks Rank #2 instills investor optimism. So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1927,PFE,"Eli Lilly & Company (LLY  -  Free Report) has received a favorable ruling from a U.S. district court in a patent dispute against India’s generic drugmaker Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited (RDY  -  Free Report). The case was related to the vitamin regimen patent on Lilly’s key cancer drug, Alimta (pemetrexed disodium).The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana validated Alimta vitamin regimen patent, stating that it would be infringed by Dr Reddy’s proposed generic products, which are alternative salt forms of pemetrexed.Concurrently, Lilly also informed that earlier this month, the district court also ruled in its favor in a lawsuit against Hospira, a subsidiary of Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report). The court denied Hospira's motion for summary judgement and instead, granted Lilly's cross-motion for summary judgement.Although the compound patent covering Alimta in the United States expired in January 2017, the vitamin regimen patent will remain valid till May 2022, if Alimta’s patent is ultimately upheld through all the remaining challenges.  The compound patent already expired across major European countries and Japan in Dec 2015.Other than Hospira and Dr Reddy’s, several other generic manufacturers including Teva (TEVA  -  Free Report) and Sandoz are seeking approvals in the United States for marketing generic forms of Alimta prior to the expiration of its vitamin regimen patents. We remind investors that last October, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office had validated the Alimta vitamin regimen.The latest wins against Hospira and Dr Reddy’s means these companies can launch their generic versions of Alimta only after the patent expires. However, both companies are expected to appeal against the district court’s decision.Notably, Alimta is one of the top revenue grossers at Lilly and a longer commercial life for Alimta would provide top-line support as several products in Lilly’s portfolio are already facing patent expiration.The entry of generic competition for Alimta following the loss of effective patent protection will cause a rapid decline in revenues for the product.In first-quarter 2018, Alimta sales rose 2% to $499.6 million as higher sales in the United States offset sales decline in the international markets. Outside the United States, the sales of this cancer drug are being hurt due to loss of exclusivity in several countries as well as competitive pressure. Its U.S. sales are also being affected by an increased competition due to the entry of immuno-oncology agents in the market. The favourable patent decision lowers the chances of a generic competition for Alimta before patent expiration, which could have hampered its sales more.Year to date, shares of Lilly have risen 2% against the industry’s decline of 4.4%. Lilly currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1930,PFE,"GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) and partner J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report) announced that the European Commission (EC) has granted marketing approval to Juluca, making it Europe’s first two-drug HIV treatment. Juluca combines two approved HIV drugs — Tivicay (50 mg) and Edurant (25 mg) — into a single, once-daily pill for the treatment of virologically suppressed HIV-1 infectionJuluca gained approval in the United States in November last year and generated sales £10 million in the first quarter of 2018.Tivicay, a novel investigational integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), is marketed by ViiV Healthcare, an HIV company majorly owned by Glaxo and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report). Edurant is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) marketed by Janssen, J&J’s pharma arm. Juluca has been developed under a partnership between ViiV Healthcare and Janssen.The approval in the EU was expected as in March this year the Committee for Human Use of Medicinal Products (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) had given a positive opinion recommending approval of Juluca.This year so far, J&J’s shares have declined 11.4% while that of Glaxo have gone up 13%. In the said time frame, the industry has witnessed a decline of 3.7%.Juluca, the first two-drug regimen to be approved, reduces the number of medicines HIV patients take without compromising on the efficacy of a conventional three-drug regimen.Juluca’s approval was based on data from two phase III SWORD studies. Data from these studies showed that the combination of Tivicay and Edurant antiretroviral was as effective as a three- or four-drug antiretroviral regimen as a maintenance therapy in HIV patients who have already achieved viral suppression.We remind investors that Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) also gained FDA approval for a single tablet HIV regimen (triple therapy) this year.  Biktarvy gained FDA approval in February this year while a regulatory application is under review in the EU.

1931,PFE,"Investors interested in stocks from the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals sector have probably already heard of Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Currently, Pfizer has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while GlaxoSmithKline has a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that PFE likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than GSK has recently. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.PFE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 12.28, while GSK has a forward P/E of 14.56. We also note that PFE has a PEG ratio of 1.80. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. GSK currently has a PEG ratio of 2.33.Another notable valuation metric for PFE is its P/B ratio of 3.07. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, GSK has a P/B of 20.17.Based on these metrics and many more, PFE holds a Value grade of B, while GSK has a Value grade of C.PFE is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that PFE is likely the superior value option right now.

1932,PFE,"Merck KGaA  is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 15.Merck’s shares have declined 11.1% so far this year against the industry’s rally of 0.8%.The company reports results under three business sectors — Healthcare, Life Science and Performance Materials.Merck’s revenues were driven by organic sales growth in its Healthcare and Life Science segments in the fourth quarter. We expect to see the same trend in the upcoming quarterly results.In December 2017, Merck’s multiple sclerosis drug, Mavenclad was approved in Australia and Canada, following its approval in Europe in the third quarter of 2017. The expansion in new geographies is likely to boost sales of the drug in the to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, in 2017, Bavencio was approved in the United States, Europe and Japan for Merkel cell carcinoma. The drug was also approved for advanced bladder cancer in the United States in 2017. Healthcare sales are likely to get a boost. The company develop Bavencio in partnership with Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) for several cancer indications.Sales of three key drugs — Rebif, Erbitux and Gonal-f — are expected to be lower in first-quarter 2018. The downside is likely to be caused by persistent competitive pressure and price reduction. Moreover, unfavorable currency movement is anticipated to dent the top line.Moreover, operating expenses increased in 2017 due to new launches and higher pipeline development cost. Expenses are estimated to increase in the first quarter as the company focuses on the development of an innovative pipeline, launch of Bavencio in new geographies as well as Mavenclad.In 2017, the company divested its biosimilar business and is currently considering strategic options for its Consumer Health segment.Merck is also focused on the development and protection of its novel DNA-sequencing technology – CRISPR. In February, the technology was issued patents in Korea and Israel. This can also increase the expense for the company.We expect management to shed light on the progress and commercialization plans for Bavencio on the earnings call. The company is likely to provide updates on its strategic plans.Merck KGaA Price and EPS Surprise  Merck KGaA Price and EPS Surprise | Merck KGaA QuoteStocks that Warrant a LookHere are a couple of healthcare stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to post an earnings beat.

1933,PFE,"President Donald Trump on Friday unveiled his plans of lowering drug prices, in keeping with promises he made in the run-up to the Presidential elections. Pharmaceutical companies and the broader industry had been anticipating that Trump would come down heavily on them, as he had long criticized drugmakers of “getting away with murder” by charging way too much for their products. However, these fears were dispelled as Trump’s proposal will actually not directly hamper the profitability of drug companies. Instead, the reforms are aimed at increasing competition for medicines, cutting list prices and reducing patients’ out-of-pocket costs. This pleasant surprise gave stocks of pharmaceutical companies a boost.Long-Standing CommittmentLowering drug prices was one of Trump’s presidential campaign promises. He had committed to take on the big drug companies, which was also supported by Trump’s Democrat opponent Hillary Clinton. Since then, Trump has time and again criticized drug manufactures and pharmaceutical companies for charging too much for their products. This had kept the pharmaceutical companies reeling under pressure for quite some time, as they had feared that Trump’s pharma plan could hurt their profits. The broader pharma sector SPDR S&P Pharmaceuticals (XPH) has declined 6.3% year to date. And the industry had feared further losses, apprehending harsh measures from Trump on Friday.Raising Competition on the AnvilThe twist in the tale came when Trump stressed on increasing competition for medicines. This was one of the highpoints of his speech on Friday. Framing his plan as the “most sweeping action in history to lower the price of prescription drugs for the American people” and describing it as “American Patients First,” he laid out a policy that intends to increase pharmaceutical competition and the power of negotiations while lowering patients’ out-of-pocket costs. Trump’s policy also aims at creating incentives to lower list prices of prescription drugs. The reforms certainly are a ray of hope for American patients for whom the rising cost of healthcare is a nagging concern. The American Patients First plan will have both immediate actions as well as future opportunities for both lowering out-of-pocket costs faced by patients and reducing drug prices. Interestingly, Trump refrained from raising direct Medicare price negotiations on Friday, although this was one of his agendas during his presidential campaign.Pharma Stocks Rally on Trump’s ReformsClearly, Trump’s American Patients First plan doesn’t seem to be a threat to pharmaceutical companies and their profits. In fact, it is very much in line with the financial interest of drugmakers and health insurers and will no way hamper their profits. These fears, which had often resulted in shares of pharma companies taking a hit in the last few months, finally saw them bouncing back on Friday. Although the sector declined initially on Friday, stocks started rallying by the time Trump had finished his speech. Shares of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) increased 6.2%. Also, shares of CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report), Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report), Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report), and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) were up3.2%, 2.8%,1.3% and 0.3%, respectively. Merck & Co has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Trump Spares DrugmakersThe biggest reason behind this rally is that Trump’s plan actually doesn’t hurt U.S. pharmaceutical companies at all. In fact, the administration keeps in place, and in a few cases, extends the role of drug middlemen, who have been often been blamed for spiking drug costs. Trump’s plan calls for drug companies to display prices in ads and restrict “gag clauses” for pharmacists. This proposal comes because some pharmacies and pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) have contracts that donot allow pharmacists from letting patients know if a drug on the cash counter would be cheaper than if it was purchased usingtheir insurance.However, Trump’splan gives the companies new powers in Medicare Part D, the U.S. program under which seniors get drug coverage. This would allow Medicare to change the list of covered drugs midyear in order to push back against price hikes of some generic drugsthat donot actually have so much competition. This led to shares of healthcare service companies like McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report), Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report), AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report) and Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH  -  Free Report) rising 2%, 1.8%, 1.4% and 1%, respectively.Summing UpTrump’s American Patients First, which comes with a set of reforms, had sparked fears among pharmaceutical companies for quite some time. However, the fears seem to have subsided somewhat, as the new plan doesn’t hurt drugmakers and their profits. This saw investors’ confidence finally getting reinstated and pharma and biotech stocks rallying.   5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.

1934,PFE,"Both Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) reported upbeat first-quarter results on May 1. In fact, both pharma giants managed to outpace their earnings estimate but missed on the revenue front. However, the companies’ top and bottom lines rose year over year.Merckhas a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Pfizer possesses a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Now, but let’s see which stock is better positioned in terms of fundamentals, post earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other major earnings came from other pharma giants like Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report).Q1 Earnings PerformanceIn the first quarter, Merck reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.05, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by six cents. The bottom line increased 19.3% from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, the company’s revenues of $10.04 billion fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.12, but increased 6% year over year. (Read More:  Merck Beats on Q1 Earnings, Lags Sales, Raises Outlook)Pfizer posted first-quarter earnings of 77 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by only 3 cents. Earnings advanced 12% from the year-ago period, due to lower tax rates and share count. Moreover, revenues increased 1% year over year to $12.91 billion but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.09 billion. (Read More: Pfizer Stock Falls on Q1 Sales Miss, Earnings Beat)Price PerformanceMerck has witnessed a rise of 5.8% in the past three months, while Pfizer has advanced only 2.6%. So Merck is a clear winner in this respect with better returns than both rival Merck and the broader industry, which declined 2% during the same period.ValuationThe most appropriate ratio to evaluate these two drug makers is perhaps EV/EBITDA. This metric is usually used to compare two stocks in the same industry. It is superior to other metrics such as P/E because it is not affected by the different capital structures of the two companies.Coming to the two pharma majors, Pfizer with an EV/EBITDA ratio of 15.63 is overvalued than the broader industry, which has an EV/EBITDA value of 11.32. On the other hand, with an EV/EBITDA ratio of 8.19, Merck is underpriced than both Pfizer and the industry.Net MarginThe pharmaceutical industry enjoys higher profit margins than several other sectors. This is possibly one of the reasons why critics of the sector continually draw attention to exorbitant drug pricing, which helps the sector maintain its steep margins.With a net margin value of 31.44%, Pfizer performs better than rival Merck, which has a net margin value of 27.85%. In comparison, the broader industry has a net margin value of 26.86%.Debt-to-Equity RatioThe debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is a good indicator of the financial health of a company and a good proxy for its debt-servicing capacity. In the context of a capital-intensive industry like pharma, this is an indicator of a company’s long-term sustainability.Merck’s debt-to-equity ratio of 61.8% is significantly high compared with the industry’s D/E ratio of 56%.  With a comparatively lower D/E ratio of 46.8%, Pfizer evidently has a better leverage condition.Earnings History and Estimate RevisionsMerck delivered positive surprises in all the last four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 8.55%. In comparison, Pfizer delivered an earnings beat in all the trailing four quarters and posted an average positive earnings surprise of around 5.23%.When considering estimate revisions, Merck’s earnings estimate for the current year has improved 1.2% over the past 30 days. Meanwhile, Pfizer’s earnings estimate has declined by 0.3% over the same period. ConclusionIn our comparative analysis, we found that both the two pharma giants have certain positives. Pfizer holds a better leverage position and has a higher net margin. However, in terms of valuation, Merck is more underpriced than Pfizer. Further, Merck has comparatively higher price performance than Pfizer.Moreover, Merck also holds an edge over Pfizer when considering its average positive earnings surprise and estimate revisions. What clinches the case in favor of Merck at this point of time is that it has a better Zacks Rank than Pfizer. In this respect, our analysis clearly indicated that Merck is better positioned than Pfizer and thus calls for investors’ attention post earnings.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1935,PFE,"Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc. (MNTA  -  Free Report) reported a loss per share of 63 cents in the quarter, wider than the year-ago loss of 46 cents.Revenues in the quarter came in at $4.8 million, significantly down from $26.6 million in the year-ago quarter.Quarter in DetailMomenta’s top-line comprises product revenues of $3.5 million earned from Sandoz’s sales of Glatopa, a generic version of Copaxone (20 mg), compared to $23.4 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was a result of lower sales due to Mylan’s (MYL  -  Free Report) entry into the Copaxone market.Collaborative research and development revenues came in at $1.3 million, compared with $3.2 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower revenue recognized from the upfront payment from Mylan as compared to the amount recognized in the 2017 period and lower reimbursable expenses for the complex generic programs.Research and development expenses decreased to $33.2 million from $36.1 million in the year-ago quarter due to a decrease in external R&D expenses for M923. General and administrative expenses also decreased 11% to $20.6 million.Outlook ReiteratedMomenta expects operating expenses (excluding stock-based compensation and net of collaborative revenues) in the range of $180-$200 million in 2018. Operating expenses in second-quarter 2018 are projected around $45-$55 million.Momenta expects to generate revenues of $45 million from Mylan as upfront payment on a quarterly basis.Pipeline UpdatesMomenta announced that the FDA has finally approved Sandoz's Abbreviated New Drug Application for Glatopa 40 mg. Both companies earlier suffered a setback with the FDA issuing a warning letter to Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) in February 2017, which is Sandoz’s contracted fill/finish manufacturing partner for Glatopa. Nevertheless, Sandoz secured customer contracts and orders of Glatopa 40 mg/mL have been shipped.Meanwhile, Momenta continues to progress with its biosimilars pipeline. In January 2018, Momenta and Mylan announced plans to initiate a patient clinical trial of M710 — a proposed biosimilar of Eylea — in the first half of 2018.  The Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for Momenta’s M923, a biosimilar version of Humira, is also ready to be filed with the FDA.  However, the filing of the BLA is dependent on the outcome of the Company’s ongoing strategic review.Momenta suffered a setback when the company and partner Mylan announced that M834, a proposed biosimilar for Orencia, did not meet its primary pharmacokinetic end points in a phase I study to compare the pharmacokinetics, safety and immunogenicity of M834 to Orencia in normal healthy volunteers. Hence, Momenta and partner Mylan continue to evaluate the next course of action.Momenta’s novel autoimmune portfolio includes — M230, a Selective Immunomodulator of Fc receptors (SIF3), M281, an anti-FcRn monoclonal antibody and M254. Momenta successfully completed a phase I single ascending dose study in healthy volunteers for M281.In January 2018, Momenta reported positive top-line data on M281 from a phase I single ascending dose (“SAD”) and multiple ascending dose (“MAD”) study of normal human volunteers. The phase I randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of M281.  Consequently, Momenta is finalizing its development strategy for M281 and is planning two proof of concept clinical trials in the second half of 2018, pending regulatory feedback.Meanwhile, Momenta and collaboration partner CSL began dosing subjects in the phase I trial in healthy volunteers to evaluate the safety and tolerability of M230. The study is expected to be completed in 2019.Momenta is also on track to complete the IND-enabling toxicology study this year and expects to initiate a trial in the second half of 2018.Our TakeMomenta reported a wider year-over-year loss in the first quarter. While the FDA approval of Glatopa 40 mg should relieve Momenta, competition will limit market share gains. We note that Mylan has already won the FDA’s approval for a generic version of Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA  -  Free Report) Copaxone 40 mg. Notably, this is the first generic of Copaxone that has been approved. Since Mylan was one of the first applicants to submit a substantially complete ANDA for glatiramer acetate Injection, 40 mg/mL, containing a Paragraph IV certification, the company and other first filers may be eligible for 180 days of generic drug exclusivity.  Momenta’s stock has gained 65.2% in the last six months as against the industry’s decline of 10.9%. Following the announcement of first-quarter of 2018 results, shares were up 1.17%. Meanwhile, the progress of biosimilars pipeline was encouraging.Zacks RankMomenta currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1936,PFE,"The first-quarter earnings season has been relatively strong. However, the stock market’s recent performance is yet to reflect the strength. While positive revisions were seen ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season, the estimate revision trend for the second quarter has been rather underwhelming.As of May 4, 2018, 409 S&P 500 members reported results, according to the latest Earnings Preview.Total earnings of these 409 index members increased 24% from the year-ago quarter on a 9.3% improvement in revenues.

1937,PFE,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) is reportedly raising prices of almost 100 drugs, effective July 1. This is the second time that the drug giant has raised the prices of its drugs this year. The scrutiny of drug prices has increased since Trump assumed office. However, with a softer drug pricing policy formed last month, we expect other companies to follow suit.The increase in price was nearly 9% for the majority of the drugs, within the agreed limit of 10% price rise a year. However, price of a few drugs like Xalatan, Viagra and Chanix have already increased in double digits including the price hike of January.On May 11, Trump announced plans to control drug prices in the United States. However, a group of investors believe the plan is not likely to have a major impact on the profits of large pharma companies. Instead of including provisions of direct negotiations by Medicare with the pharma companies, Trump targeted intermediaries, certain small pharma companies and foreign countries. Thus, Medicare is a major customer of drugs, paying nearly 30% of dollar values of prescriptions filled. Medicare could have negotiated lower prices directly from the manufacturers.The President also expects to increase competition by streamlining some approval-related regulatory processes and promoting faster approval to generics/biosimilars. The plan allows more substitutions/additions in Medicare’s drug list for single-source generics to contain price rise and gives sponsors more negotiation power with manufacturers. It also instructs companies to display list prices in advertising. The plan also focuses more on transparency related to pricing and availability of generics.Moreover, the announcement of the price hike by Pfizer comes after weeks of Trump’s claim that pharma companies will take massive price cuts voluntarily soon.Pfizer has defended the price rise by stating that list price does not reflect actual price, which includes discount. It also mentioned that it has hiked prices for only one-tenth of its drug portfolio and also reduced prices of five drugs by 16% to 44%.Meanwhile, price hike by one company may soon trigger a market-wide increase in drug prices. Thus, Pfizer’s move can again stir the opposition related to drug price rise, especially by large pharma companies. Along with Pfizer, stock prices of several other large cap pharma companies moved north on Jul 2 including Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report). A rise in drugs prices will certainly help these companies to boost its profits.So far this year, the large cap pharma industry has declined 5.1% against the S&P 500’s rise of 2.2%.We expect investors to remain focused on other pharma companies for any announcement related to drug prices and any subsequent move by the government to restrict any further hike.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1938,PFE,"Pfizer, Inc (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted a priority review to its new drug application (NDA) filed for the pipeline candidate glasdegib.Pfizer is looking to get glasdegib approved for the first-line treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in combination with a chemotherapy treatment with respect to patients, ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.Data from the phase II BRIGHT 1003 study showed that glasdegib, an oral smoothened inhibitor, led to a significant improvement in overall survival when added to low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) in comparison to LDAC alone in previously untreated patients with AML or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome, who were ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. The findings from the study were presented at the 58th American Society of Hematology in 2016.The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act or PDUFA goal date in December 2018.Earlier this year, Pfizer enrolled in a phase III BRIGHT AML 1019 trial (NCT03416179), evaluating glasdegib as an intensive/non-intensive chemotherapy on patients with newly diagnosed AML.Per the company’s press release, AML, a rapidly progressing blood cancer, represents a market with huge demand for new treatment options.Shares of Pfizer have inched up 0.3% year to date against the industry’s decline of 6.2%. Pfizer currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1939,PFE,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (“DMD”) is a rare genetic disease and a severe form of muscular dystrophy, primarily affecting males. It progressively weakens and degenerates skeletal and heart muscles.The symptoms of muscle weakness generally start to appear as early as four years of age in boys and progresses quickly.Duchenne muscular dystrophy is one of the nine types of muscular dystrophy caused by the absence of a particular gene, dystrophin, which the body uses to keep the muscle cells intact. The disease starts to affect the muscles in the hips, pelvic area, thighs and shoulders in early stages and leads to degeneration of voluntary muscles in the arms, legs and trunk gradually. As the disease progresses, it affects the heart and respiratory muscles in early teen patients.Life expectancy of DMD patients is as low as early adulthood. However, the scenario is changing with advances in cardiac and respiratory care with patients living till their 50s.Due to the severity and rarity of DMD, the FDA is also incentivizing the companies developing treatments to treat this rare muscular degenerative disease by granting orphan drug designation to several candidates. This designation gives seven years of marketing exclusivity upon approval, research funding eligibility, tax credits for certain research costs, and a waiver of the FDA application user fee.However, there are very few companies developing DMD treatments due to lower number of patients. Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.’s (SRPT  -  Free Report) Exondys 51 is the first approved drug in the United States, which has been available since late 2016. The drug is a small molecule, which targets mutation of the DMD gene susceptible to exon 51 skipping. Exondys 51 and PTC Therapeutics, Inc.’s (PTCT  -  Free Report) Emflaza are among the approved treatments of DMD in the United States.The focus is currently shifting to development of gene therapies for the treatment of the disease. Gene therapies deliver a functional copy of the dystrophin to muscle cells to restore its production.3 Pharma/Biotech Companies Developing Gene Therapy to Treat DMDHere we discuss three companies, which are researching and developing advance treatments for DMD.Sarepta has about eight exon-skipping candidates in its pipeline. Its lead candidate, golodirsen, is an exon-53 skipping candidate, which has demonstrated better efficacy than Exondys 51 with 100% response rate in a mid-stage study. A new drug application (“NDA”) is expected to be filed by the end of this year.Apart from exon-skipping candidates, Sarepta is focusing on gene therapies for developing treatments for DMD. The company also initiated two phase I/II studies in the fourth quarter of 2017, which will evaluate gene therapies for DMD. Earlier this week, it announced promising preliminary results from an early-stage study evaluating the gene therapy, AAVrh74.MHCK7.micro-dystrophin.

It’s the oldest member of the index.Starbucks warned on its guidance for the second quarter and questions were raised about where future growth may come from.Both are the type of stocks that investors like to hold for long periods, meaning 5 to 20 years.But should you own them for that long? And when do you know to sell?Value Investing and Buy and HoldValue investing and long term buy and hold investing can often go hand-in-hand because value investors like to buy stocks that are being rejected by the rest of Wall Street, and then they hold until there is a turnaround.Value investors usually have the patience to stay in a stock for years.Warren Buffett, the most famous value investor in the world, also buys and holds, often for decades.But even Buffett would agree that not all stocks are meant to be held for a long time period. For example, Buffett just sold out of his recent IBM position even though he had only owned it a few years.How long should investors hold a stock?There are 4 criteria investors might want to consider.Criteria for Long Term Buy and Hold Investors1.       Have the company fundamentals changed? Is it still in the same business as when you originally bought the stock?2.       Do you trust current management? If you own a stock for decades, management should change.3.       Are the hardships easy to turn around? Some companies seem to be on a permanent turnaround.4.       Think about how the company fits into your long-term investing plan. Does it still have a place?Former Long Term Holds: Are They Buys Now?These 3 companies have been in many investor portfolios over the years. Some investors have likely owned them for decades.But should they be going forward?1.       Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) was one of the most popular stocks of the 1990s. From Jan 1, 1990 until Jan 1, 2000, the stock rose over 1000%. The other big cap drug stocks weren’t too shabby either. But over the last 18 years, it’s been a different story. Still, the shares look cheap now. Pfizer has a forward P/E of just 12. Should you look at Pfizer if you’re a long-term investor?2.       ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) will now be the oldest component in the Dow once GE is removed. It looks pretty cheap, with a forward P/E of 16.9 and earnings growth expected of 33%. How did you do if you held it the last 18 years though?3.       Tootsie Roll  is known as a “secret company” as it won’t talk with analysts and holds no investor conference calls. Yet the stock was one of the best performers in the last bull rally of 1982 to 2000. One family owns 51% of the shares, however, and the succession plan is unknown. A long-term hold in the 80s and 90s worked with Tootsie Roll, but what about now?Find out all of Tracey’s long-term investor tips on this week’s podcast.[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of SBUX in her personal portfolio.]Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1941,PFE,"Ever since President Trump’s imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from China, markets at large have suffered dearly. There have been a number of meetings between trade representatives from both the countries but all in vain.To further escalate trade-war tensions, reports have surfaced from the U.S. Treasury Department that it has been drafting policies, which prohibit firms having more than 25% Chinese ownership to benefit from emerging technologies in the United States.Such policies would have negative ramifications for industries like healthcare, biotech and pharmaceutical which are tech-heavy and need to acquire industrially efficient technologies for growth and sustenance. So would a trade-war with China turn out to be a nightmare for the U.S. healthcare sector? Let’s have a look.Trump’s Protectionism Would Dampen U.S. Healthcare FortunesEarly-stage pharmaceutical startups and biotech companies have historically benefited from increased access to Chinese investment and resources. Intellectual property rights’ protection is going to hamper the growing entrepreneurial spirit in the biotech space in the long run. The brunt would be borne more by relatively small-scale startups as American VCs focus more on larger startups from top-notch universities.Further, China has not included any medical products in the retaliatory tariffs that it imposed on the United States and is not likely to do so in the future as well. However, in case such a scenario occurs, it would not be too good for the healthcare industry. As a norm, China refrains from using copies of drugs from American biotech companies. Experts fear that if China gets down to violating patent rights due to the escalation of trade war, it might start copying drugs from companies having significant exposure to the Asian country.Under such circumstances, companies from the U.S. pharmaceutical and drug industry would have to pay dearly. Such a turn of events would also result in dwindling global share of the U.S. healthcare industry.Market leaders of the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceutical Industry such as AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report), Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Pifzer (PFE  -  Free Report) would end up being the biggest losers. Such companies not only have significant Chinese exposure but are highly vulnerable to instances of I.P. right infringements. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Chinese Investment is Oxygen for U.S. Biotech and Pharma Chinese venture-capital funds have invested a whopping $1.4 billion in U.S. biotech and drug companies in the period between January through March. This surpasses the $125.5 million in investments by Chinese VCs for the whole of 2017. Part of such an increase can be attributed to China’s efforts in becoming the leader in healthcare investments across the globe.China increasingly wants to make use of the manufacturing-intensive nature of their economy. Another reason for typically increasing investments in U.S. biotech firms is that China wants to access novel therapies that it can make use of along with high returns from such investments.However, any restriction by the Trump administration on Chinese involvement in U.S. biotech can spell doomsday for the industry. One of the big reasons is that it is relatively cheaper for the drug and pharmaceutical companies to perform clinical trials in China. The China Drug Administration (CDA) or the Chinese FDA takes less than a third of the time taken by the U.S. FDA in approving results. Consequently, costs involved are also lower over there.To ConcludeThe U.S. pharmaceutical industry has suffered in the recent past due to rising costs associated with raw materials. Trump’s act of tariff imposition on China has proved to be rather counterproductive for several industries at large and might turn out to be nightmarish for the healthcare industry.It is a known fact that Chinese investments breathe life into small and mid-scale healthcare companies in America. Finally, in the event of China infringing drug patent rights from American companies having significant operations on Chinese shores, a bloodbath in the healthcare industry would be inevitable.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1942,PFE,"First-quarter results of pharma bigwigs like Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) stole the limelight this week. Other than that, Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) gained FDA approval for the second indication of its CAR-T therapy, Kymriah. While AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) submitted a regulatory application in the EU for its psoriasis candidate, risankizumab, Merck’s PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda gained FDA’s Priority Review status for yet another label expansion application.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesMixed Q1 Results for Merck & Pfizer: Both the pharma giants beat estimates for earnings but missed the same for sales. While Pfizer re-affirmed its previously issued guidance for 2018, Merck raised its outlook for both earnings and sales. Both the companies witnessed a relatively weaker top-line performance in the quarter.For Merck, strong sales of Keytruda, Gardasil and Bridion were partially offset by lower sales of other key therapies – RotaTeq, Zepatier and Zostavax. Meanwhile, loss of market exclusivity for several drugs also hurt the top line.While for Pfizer, the top-line was hurt by decline in sales of key drugs like Lyrica, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13, and Enbrel, loss of exclusivity for some products like Viagra and Pristiq and continued supply shortages in legacy Hospira products.Allergan beat estimates for both earnings and revenues in the first quarter of 2018 and raised its 2018 guidance for both earnings and sales.Novartis’ Kymriah Gets FDA Approval for Second Indication: Novartis’ supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) looking to get its CAR-T therapy Kymriah approved for the second indication was granted approval by the FDA. With the latest approval, Kymriah suspension has been approved for intravenous infusion for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), high grade B-cell lymphoma and DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma.Kymriah was the first CAR-T therapy to obtain FDA approval in August 2017 for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor ALL that is refractory or in second or later relapse.Separately, Novartis announced that the FDA has given a complete response letter to its BLA for its proposed biosimilar version of Roche’s cancer drug, Rituxan.Merck’s Keytruda in News: Merck’s supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) looking to get overall survival data from the phase III KEYNOTE-189 study included on the label of the PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda was granted priority review by the FDA. The FDA will give its decision on Sep 23, 2018.The study evaluated Keytruda, in combination with Lilly’s Alimta (pemetrexed) and platinum chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin) for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 expression. The combination treatment improved overall survival regardless of PD-L1 expression including in patients whose tumors tested negative for PD-L1.Notably, in May 2017, this combination therapy was granted an accelerated approval by the FDA for the aforementioned indication. The approval was based on tumor response rate and PFS data from the KEYNOTE-021 study. Hence, the positive readouts from the KEYNOTE-189 confirmatory study will help the company gain continued approval for the combo therapy, which should support uptake and sales.Merck also announced interim data from another pivotal lung cancer study on Keytruda, which met a pre-specified secondary endpoint of overall response rate (ORR) in an early cohort of participants. The phase 3 KEYNOTE-407 study evaluated Keytruda in combination with carboplatin-paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel for the first-line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC.AbbVie Submits Application for Psoriasis Candidate in EU: AbbVie submitted a marketing application to the European regulatory authorities for investigational interleukin-23 (IL-23) inhibitor, risankizumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) is supported by data from four pivotal phase III studies. Data from these studies have shown that more than half of the patients receiving risankizumab achieved complete skin clearance at one year.Meanwhile, AbbVie also announced commencement of a self-tender offer for up to $7.5 billion of its common stock at a price not less than $99.00 per share and not more than $114.00 per share.United Therapeutics to Acquire SteadyMed: United Therapeutics Corporation (UTHR  -  Free Report) announced a definitive merger agreement with SteadyMed Ltd. per which United Therapeutics will acquire the latter for $216 million including contingent payments. With the deal, United Therapeutics will add SteadyMed’s drug device pipeline product, Trevyent for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) patients to its portfolio. The product could have posed competition to United Therapeutics’ RemoSynch implantable pump, which is under review in the United States.Trevyent is a single-use, pre-filled pump that has been developed by SteadyMed to deliver a two-day supply of treprostinil subcutaneously using SteadyMed’s PatchPump technology to treat PAH. Though SteadyMed received a refuse-to-file letter from the FDA for want of further information, SteadyMed intends to resubmit its NDA by the end of 2018.Allergan’s Ubrogepant Succeeds in 2nd Phase III Study: Allergan announced that the second of two pivotal phase III studies evaluating its oral anti-CGRP acute migraine treatment ubrogepant met its co-primary endpoints. The phase III data showed ubrogepant displaying strong efficacy and a clean side effect profile.The ACHIEVE II study evaluated the efficacy and safety of orally administered ubrogepant (25 mg and 50 mg) for treating a single migraine attack of moderate-to-severe headache intensity.The study data demonstrated that a “significant greater percentage of patients” treated with ubrogepant, at both the doses, were free from pain at two hours after the initial dose as compared to those treated with placebo. Also, a statistically significant greater percentage of ubrogepant patients taking the 50 mg dose experienced absence of the “most bothersome migraine-associated symptom” -- either photophobia, phonophobia or nausea -- at two hours after the initial dose compared to those treated with placebo. However, the 25 mg dose failed to demonstrate statistical significance in this endpoint.J&J Seeks Label Expansion of PAH Drug: J&J’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Actelion submitted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the FDA seeking approval for a label expansion of its PAH drug, Opsumit (macitentan) to include treatment of patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH).Also, J&J announced a definitive agreement to acquire private biotech, BeneVir Biopharm.

1943,PFE,"Myriad Genetics, Inc. (MYGN  -  Free Report) has moved one step forward in acquiring the FDA approval for the company’s BRACAnalysis CDx test to be used as a companion diagnostic with Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) PARP inhibitor, talazoparib. The company noted that the FDA has accepted its supplementary premarket approval (sPMA) application for BRACAnalysis CDx, which can help identifying the best responders to talazoparib.It is also encouraging to know that talazoparib is currently holding the status of New Drug Application (NDA) priority review from the FDA with a target date set for December 2018.Both Myriad Genetics and Pfizer submitted their respective sPMA and NDA proposals to the FDA, based on results from the Pfizer-sponsored EMBRACA trial, which evaluated talazoparib compared with chemotherapy in patients with germline (inherited) BRCA-mutated (gBRCAm), HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Last December, the primary results of the study were presented. The data showed that patients with gBRCA+ locally advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) demonstrated superior progression-free survival (PFS) when treated with talazoparib in comparison to those having received physician’s choice standard-of-care chemotherapy. Recent Developments in BRACAnalysisMyriad Genetics has been leaving no stone unturned to boost the uptake of BRACAnalysis CDx. In this regard, the system got manufacturing and marketing approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, earlier in April this year. The system can now be used as a companion diagnostic with the PARP inhibitor, Lynparza.Notably, in January, the FDA approved BRACAnalysis CDx test for usage as a companion diagnostic with AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) PARP inhibitor, Lynparza (olaparib) on patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and germline BRCA mutation.Market PotentialPer Myriad Genetics, about 40,000 patients with metastatic disease are currently eligible for BRACAnalysis testing in Japan. Moreover, approximately 15,000 new cases of HER2-negative breast cancer are diagnosed every year. This promising data indicates what a timely and strategic role the latest approval is likely to play in favor of the company.Share Price Performance  Myriad Genetics has been gaining investors’ confidence from consistently positive results. Over the past three months, shares of the company have significantly outperformed the broader industry. The stock has surged 36.6% against the broader industry’s 5.2% fall.Myriad Genetics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1944,PFE,"GlaxoSmithKline plc’s (GSK  -  Free Report) HIV company, ViiV Healthcare announced that the two late-stage studies testing its two-drug HIV regimen of dolutegravir (Tivicay) and lamivudine (Epivir) met the primary endpoint.The two phase III studies, GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2, evaluated the two-drug regimen in treatment naïve - those who have not received prior antiviral therapy -  HIV-1 infected adults compared to a three-drug regimen of dolutegravir plus tenofovir alafenamide fumarate and emtricitabine. The studies demonstrated that the dolutegravir and lamivudine regimen was non-inferior to the standard three-drug regimen in HIV control. This means a two-drug HIV regimen can control HIV in treatment-naïve patients as effectively as a three-drug regimen.Shares of Glaxo were up almost 2% on Thursday in response to the positive news. This year so far, Glaxo’s shares have gained 18.2% against the industry’s decline of 4.2%. Shares of Glaxo also received a boost this week as Mylan’s (MYL  -  Free Report) application to get approval for a generic version of Glaxo’s blockbuster respiratory drug, Advair was rejected for the second time by the FDA. Full results from the studies will be presented at a future medical meeting. Regulatory application to get the two-drug regimen of dolutegravir and lamivudine approved are expected to be filed later this year.Glaxo has several phase III studies ongoing evaluating two-drug regimens for HIV-1 treatment. These studies, conducted across global research centers, include approximately 1,400 HIV infected men and women.The two-drug regimens reduce the number of medicines HIV patients take without compromising on the efficacy of a conventional three-drug regimen, thereby reducing long-term toxicity concerns.Juluca is Glaxo’s first and the only approved two-drug regimen. It gained approval in EU last month and in the United States in November last year. It generated sales of £10 million in the first quarter of 2018. Glaxo has developed Juluca in partnership with J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report). Juluca combines two approved HIV drugs — Glaxo’s Tivicay/dolutegravir(50 mg) and J&J’s Edurant/rilpivirine(25 mg) — into a single, once-daily pill for the treatment of virologically suppressed HIV-1 infection.ViiV Healthcare is an HIV company majorly owned by Glaxo.

Last reported quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 9.70%.Shares of Agios have soared 67.7% in a year’s time, comparing favorably with the industry’s increase of 12.5%. The company’s earnings track record shows mixed results with the company having outpaced estimates twice in the trailing four quarters and missed the same in the other two. Overall, Agios came up with an average negative surprise of 1.34%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors at PlayAgios’ only marketed drug is Idhifa (enasidenib), which received an FDA approval last August for treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML) having an isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2) mutation. Per the last report, the drug generated strong sales and we expect encouraging revenues in the first quarter as well.Moreover, Agios’ progress with the pipeline has been quite impressive. In fact, investors’ focus will remain on the same in the to-be-reported quarter. Two interesting candidates in the company’s cancer portfolio are IDH1 mutant inhibitor, AG-120 (ivosidenib) and a pan-IDH mutant inhibitor, AG-881.Ivosidenib is under priority review in the United States for treating patients with R/R AML with an IDH1 mutation. An approval for ivosidenib is expected in the third quarter of 2018. Additionally, the company anticipates a regulatory filing for the candidate in the EU during the fourth quarter of 2018 for the same indication.Ivosidenib is also being evaluated in phase I study for addressing advanced hematologic malignancies and combined with Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Vidaza, it is under assessment in phase I/II, for the cure of newly diagnosed AML patients, who are not eligible for an intensive chemotherapy.Meanwhile, Agios is conducting phase I programs on AG-881 for treating patients with advanced IDH1 or IDH2 mutant-positive solid tumors including glioma. In the second half of 2017, the company announced positive findings from the study.Notably, the company also plans to initiate a perioperative window trial to analyze ivosidenib and AG-881 in low grade glioma for investigating the effects on brain tumor tissue in the first half of 2018.The company has another interesting candidate in its portfolio. Its lead rare genetic diseases candidate, AG-348, is under evaluation in a phase II trial on adult, transfusion-independent patients with Pyruvate kinase deficiency. Agios reported positive data from the program in June 2017. The FDA granted a fast track designation to the candidate for the given indication. As the RGD market still remains unexplored, newer therapies in this area hold huge potential.Nonetheless, this March, Agios announced commencement of a phase I study, evaluating its first-in-class methionine adenosyltransferase 2a (MAT2A) inhibitor, AG-270, for patients with solid tumors or lymphoma with deletion of the MTAP. We expect management to produce an update on the same in first-quarter earnings release.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Agios is likely to beat on earnings this reporting cycle because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Agios has an Earnings ESP of +1.72%, representing the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate (loss of $1.57 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (loss of $1.60). A positive ESP indicates a likely earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Agios has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and together with a positive ESP, chances of an earnings beat in the stock’s upcoming release are pegged higher.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

1946,PFE,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings of 94 cents per share exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 85 cents and the year-ago quarter earnings of 84 cents.Total revenues of $5.19 billion were slightly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.18 billion and increased 5% from $4.93 billion recorded in the year-ago period. Strong sales of Opdivo and Eliquis contributed to the top line in the reported quarter.Shares of the company were up almost 0.5% in pre-market trading, possibly on better-than expected earnings. However, Bristol-Myers’ shares have declined 17% so far this year, which compares unfavorably with the industry’s decrease of 4.9%.Quarterly DetailsRevenues were up 1% year over year when adjusted for foreign exchange impact. Revenues increased 1% to $2.8 billion in the United States and 10% outside the country. Ex-U.S. revenues were up 1% when adjusted for foreign exchange impact.Leukemia drug Sprycel raked in sales of $438 million, down 5% year over year. U.S. sales for the drug were down 13% to $214 million. A label expansion of the drug in pediatric patients in the United States last November presumably did not have much impact on sales.Rheumatoid arthritis drug, Orencia, was up 11% in first-quarter 2018 to $593 million. Melanoma drug, Yervoy contributed $249 million to the top line during the reported quarter, down 25%. U.S. sales for the drug were down 33% to $162 million.Opdivo, which is approved for multiple cancer indications, generated revenues of $1.51 billion, up 34% from the year-ago period.Sales of cardiovascular drug, Eliquis, were $1.51 billion during the reported quarter, up 37% year over year. Multiple myeloma drug, Empliciti recorded sales of $55 million, up 4% year over year.However, the performance of key drugs in the Virology unit continues to disappoint. Sales of Baraclude declined 20% to $225 million. The Reyataz and Sustiva franchises deteriorated 36% and 54% year over year to $124 million and $84 million, respectively. The Hepatitis franchise lost 98% of its year-ago quarter sales and contributed a mere $3 million to revenues.Research and development (R&D) expenses in the quarter decreased 4.1% to $1.25 billion. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses declined 9.7% to $980 million.Gross margin was 69.5% in the quarter compared with 74.3% in the year-ago quarter due to change in product mix.Regulatory UpdateSubsequent to the quarter in April, the FDA approved Opdivo+Yervoy combination regimen for treating intermediate- and poor-risk advanced renal cell carcinoma in patients who have not received any prior treatment. In March, the FDA had granted priority review to a supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) seeking approval of the combination regimen for treating microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient metastatic colorectal cancer.Also, in April, the FDA granted priority review to the sBLA seeking approval of Opdivo monotherapy in patients with small cell lung cancer in third or later line setting. A new dosing regimen for Opdivo, 480 mg every four weeks, was also approved for the majority of indications.CollaborationsIn April 2018, Bristol-Myers collaborated with Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Janssen, to develop and commercialize its Factor Xia inhibitor program, including BMS-986177, for treating major thrombotic conditions. In the same month, Bristol-Myers and privately-held Illumina, Inc. announced a collaboration to utilize the latter’s next-generation sequencing technology.In February, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report) entered into a strategic development and commercialization collaboration for Nektar’s lead immuno-oncology program, NKTR-214. Per the collaboration, the companies will develop and commercialize NKTR-214 in combination with Opdivo and Opdivo plus Yervoy in more than 20 indications across nine tumor types, as well as potential combinations with other anti-cancer agents from either of the respective companies and/or third parties. Both the companies plan to initiate studies in renal cell carcinoma and melanoma in mid-2018.Pipeline UpdateIn April 2018, Bristol Myers announced data from a phase III study, Checkmate-227, which showed superior progression-free survival in first-line non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) treated with Opdivo – Yervoy combination compared to chemotherapy. In January 2018, Bristol-Myers announced positive data from Phase II CheckMate-142 study evaluating the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy in patients with DNA mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).The company also announced data from the phase III study, CheckMate-078, evaluating Opdivo in Chinese population. Data showed that the drug achieved superior overall survival in previously-treated patients with NSCLC as compared to docetaxel.Data from a long-term follow up phase III study – CheckMate -141 – showed that Opdivo reduced risk of death by 32% in metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck after a minimum two years of follow-up compared to standard chemotherapy.In March, Bristol-Myers along with Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced data from a real-world data analysis of different direct oral anticoagulants including Eliquis, J&J’s Xarelto and Boehringer Ingelheim’s Pradaxa. Data showed that Eliquis achieved significantly lower rates of both stroke/systemic embolism and major bleeding compared to both Xarelto and Pradaxa.2018 Guidance UpdatedBristol-Myers increased its adjusted earnings expectations for 2018. The company now projects earnings in the range of $3.35 to $3.45 per share (previously $3.15 to $3.30). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $3.22. The company expects worldwide revenues to increase in mid-single digits.Our TakeBristol-Myers beat earnings expectations, primarily on robust sales of Opdivo and Eliquis in the quarter. The increase in 2018 guidance for adjusted earnings was also encouraging. We are positive on Bristol-Myers’ efforts to develop its pipeline, especially Opdivo. Several label expansion applications for Opdivo are under review in the United States and Europe. Potential approval will further boost the prospects of this blockbuster drug. Also, superiority of Eliquis in real world data analysis is expected to further boost sales of the drug.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Bristol-Myers Squibb Company QuoteBristol-Myers carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1947,PFE,"GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) is transferring the rare disease gene therapy portfolio to private biotech Orchard Therapeutics in exchange for a 19.9% stake in the company as well as a seat on its board. In addition, Glaxo will also be entitled to royalties and commercial milestone payments related to the rare disease medicines.Glaxo’s rare disease gene therapies include marketed drug Strimvelis, a gene therapy for children with ADA-SCID which is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder that causes immunodeficiency, along with some pipeline candidates including late-stage programs as well as some pre-clinical ones.Glaxo announced the strategic review of the rare disease unit in last July. Back then, the company informed that it plans to terminate, partner or divest about 30 pre-clinical and clinical programs by 2020 while allocating 80% of capital to priority programs in two current areas -- Respiratory and HIV/infectious -- and two potential areas -- Oncology and Immuno-inflammation.Interestingly, at a time, when companies whose product/pipeline portfolio includes rare disease drugs, are in great demand, Glaxo is divesting the portfolio of rare disease therapies. However, Glaxo will continue to invest in cell and gene therapies with a focus on oncology.Shares of the British drugmaker have risen 16.5% this year so far against a decline of 1.7% for the industry.Last month, Glaxo announced an agreement with Swiss giant Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) to buy the latter’s stake in their Consumer Healthcare joint venture (JV) for $13 billion (£9.2 billion). (Read More: Glaxo Buys Novartis’ Stake in Consumer Healthcare JV).With the acquisition of Novartis’ 36.5% stake, Glaxo will now have 100% ownership of the Consumer Healthcare unit that includes products such as Sensodyne and Flonase.Glaxo and Novartis created the JV in 2015 as part of a three-part transaction between the two companies by combining their consumer divisions. Glaxo owned 63.5% share of the JV.Also, Glaxo is looking at strategic alternatives for Horlicks and other nutrition products to help fund the deal. These nutrition products are mostly sold by Glaxo’s Indian subsidiary, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare. Glaxo owns 72.5% stake in the Indian subsidiary, which will also be included in the strategic review process. Food giants, Nestle, Kraft Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report) and Unilever are being speculated as the frontrunners to bid for the Horlicks business.Glaxo’s latest deal with Novartis comes less than a week after it announced that it is withdrawing from the race to buy Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Consumer Healthcare segment. (Read more: Glaxo Drops Bid for Pfizer Unit, Shingrix Gains EU/Japan Nod).Pfizer is exploring strategic alternatives for the Consumer Healthcare segment, including a partial or a full separation through a spin-off, sale or other transaction.Glaxo carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1948,PFE,"Alzheimer’s, a fatal illness that causes progressive decline in memory, has always been a highly challenging area with not much progress being made in spite of significant investments (both funds and resources).On Tuesday, Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and its Swiss partner AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) said they are discontinuing two late-stage studies on their Alzheimer’s disease candidate, lanabecestat, on recommendation of the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC). The IDMC said that the two studies were unlikely to meet their primary goals upon completion. This prompted the decision of stalling the studies on the oral beta secretase cleaving enzyme (BACE) inhibitor.Several companies have failed to develop safe and effective treatment options for this deadly brain disease.In May this year, J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report) halted development of atabecestat, its investigational BACE inhibitor, which was being developed for preclinical stage AD due to safety concerns.In February this year, Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) discontinued the second late-stage study evaluating its BACE inhibitor verubecestat for the treatment of prodromal AD as its success was unlikely. In February last year, Merck discontinued a late-stage study evaluating verubecestat for mild-to-moderate AD due to lack of efficacy.In January, Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) said it will end R&D efforts in the Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease areas. Long back, Pfizer had shelved its late-stage AD candidate, bapineuzumab IV after it failed two phase III studies.In late 2017, Biogen’s (BIIB  -  Free Report) AD study on BAN2401 failed to show early positive results, which raised investors’ concerns about the candidate’s chances of success.Clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Axovant Sciences suffered a major setback in September 2017 when its investigational AD candidate failed to meet the co-primary efficacy endpoints in a late-stage study. The company decided to discontinue development of the 35 mg dose for the treatment of AD.Lilly decided in November 2016 that it would not seek approval for its investigational AD treatment, solanezumab, following disappointing results from a late-stage study. The candidate was being evaluated to see whether it can slow the progression of memory problems associated with amyloid, a protein that forms plaques in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s.According to the Alzheimer's Association, in the 10 years from 2002-2012, 244 drugs were tested for Alzheimer’s in studies registered with clinicaltrials.gov out of which only one succeeded and went on to gain FDA approval.This may be somewhat because the underlying causes of severe neurological ailments like Alzheimer’s may not be as clear as diseases like cancer. Also, Alzheimer’s progress may go unnoticed for years.  By the time, the symptoms of the ailment become evident, significant functions may be already lost, which makes developing drugs to treat this disease difficult.Interest Still Alive in the AreaDespite the setbacks, several companies continue to invest heavily in developing Alzheimer’s disease treatments, given the high commercial potential in this market. Success in this area means huge returns considering more than five million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease with the numbers expected to triple by 2050 (Data: Alzheimer's Association). It is considered to be one of the biggest burdens of society and is the sixth leading cause of death across all ages in the United States. The market has immense commercial potential and companies coming out with new treatments could rake in billions of dollars in sales.Biogen, Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), Eisai, AstraZeneca and Amgen are presently working on Alzheimer’s disease treatments.Biogen’s AD pipeline comprises mid as well as late-stage candidates with different mechanisms of action including anti-tau candidate (BIIB092), anti-amyloid (aducanumab) candidates as well as a BACE inhibitor (elenbecestat) program. These candidates are being developed in collaboration with Eisai.  Meanwhile, Novartis and Amgen are collaborating for BACE 1 inhibitor, CNP520, which has fast track status in the United Status. Roche is collaborating with AC Immune for the development of Alzheimer’s disease treatments.Lilly and AstraZeneca are also developing another treatment for Alzheimer's disease, an antibody targeting beta amyloid in early-stage studies.Earlier this year, the FDA proposed new guidelines, which are aimed at lowering the clinical study goals of Alzheimer’s disease drugs aimed to treat earlier-stage patients who have not yet displayed functional disability or clinical abnormality. This strategy is part of FDA’s ongoing efforts to expand access to safe and effective treatment options for many serious conditions. These efforts by the FDA may also reinvigorate research efforts for Alzheimer’s drugs after repeated failures.Lilly and Merck carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1949,PFE,"There is no approved therapy that can completely cure autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. The development of new treatment technologies is ongoing. Meanwhile, it is difficult to control autoimmune diseases in the majority of patients. The newest class of medications to treat these diseases is janus kinase (“JAK”) inhibitors, which are providing patients a better treatment option. This class of therapies has generated significant interest due to their better efficacy compared to tumor necrosis factor (“TNF”) inhibitor therapies.Autoimmune DiseasesIn patients with autoimmune diseases, the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks the healthy cells. Scientists are yet to find the reason behind this abnormality. However, the incidence of autoimmune diseases is on the rise. There are multiple types of autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”), psoriasis, multiple sclerosis (“MS”), inflammatory bowel disease (“IBD”), etc. Several companies are dedicated to bringing better drugs for the treatment of these diseases. The symptoms include fatigue, muscle aches, swelling, and redness in the affected body parts.The most common and first-line treatment for autoimmune disease is disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), especially methotrexate. Apart from methotrexate, there are several classes of DMARDs including TNF inhibitor therapies approved for these diseases that are performing well. AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira and Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel are blockbuster TNF inhibitor drugs among others. However, these treatments have serious safety issues which include increased risk tuberculosis and lymphoma among others.JAK InhibitorsSeveral pharma companies are developing JAK inhibitors, which work by blocking a particular signal of a body’s immune response, cytokines, instead of suppressing the immune system as done by DMARDs. Patients treated with JAK-inhibitors in clinical studies have shown faster and better response to the disease. However, the safety concern still looms large. The segment is attractive for companies as there are only two JAK inhibitors, presently approved for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, especially RA. However, several companies are developing their candidates, which is likely to increase competition going forward.The segment was in news recently as Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Olumiant, a JAK inhibitor, received approval in the United States and AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced top-line data from a late-stage study evaluating its JAK inhibitor candidate,upadacitinib.4 Pharma/Biotech Companies in FocusGiven the growing interest in JAK inhibitors, let’s take a look at some pharma and biotech companies that are looking to change the way autoimmune diseases are treated.Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xeljanz (tofacitinib) is the first approved JAK-inhibitor in the United States for the treatment of RA. It has been available in the market since 2012. The drug is also approved for psoriatic arthritis. It generated sales of $326 million in the first quarter of 2018, up 30.4% year over year. A regulatory application seeking line extension of the drug in ulcerative colitis was approved late last month in the United States. Regulatory applications seeking approval in the above three indications are under review in Europe.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Eli Lilly’s JAK-inhibitor, Olumiant (baricitinib), is the second drug to receive approval for treating RA in the United States. The drug was approved early this month. However, it was launched in certain European countries in 2017. We note that the FDA rejected the company’s new drug application seeking approval of Olumiant in April 2017 citing safety concerns. Lilly develops and commercializes the drug in partnership with Incyte Corporation. The drug generated sales of $32.2 million in the first quarter, sequentially up 40%. Lilly is currently evaluating the drug in another autoimmune indication, atopic dermatitis (eczema), in a late-stage study.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).AbbVie is another company, which is focused on developing JAK inhibitor based treatments. The company’s JAK inhibitor, upadacitinib, showed promising results in late-stage studies evaluating the candidate in RA patients. It is also being developed for atopic dermatitis in a late-stage study for which it enjoys breakthrough therapy status in the United States. Another late-stage study is evaluating the candidate in Crohn’s disease.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Galapagos NV (GLPG  -  Free Report) is developing its JAK inhibitor candidate, filgotinib, in collaboration with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report). Separate late-stage studies are evaluating the candidate in RA, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Moreover, several mid-stage studies are evaluating the candidate in multiple autoimmune indications including ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and cutaneous lupus erythematosus among others. Data from a mid-stageI study evaluating filgotinib in psoriatic arthritis showed significant improvement in patients.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Prospects of JAK Inhibitors With several blockbuster DMARDs nearing patent expiration, this new class of drugs holds potential to replace the existing treatments. This boosts the prospects of the companies that have these drugs/candidates in their pipeline or commercial portfolio.However, JAK inhibitors also have several side effects, which may delay their approval. We note that a lower dose of Lilly’s Olumiant was approved along with a boxed warning stating risk of serious infections, malignancies and thrombosis.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1950,PFE,"This week was ruled by cancer data presentations at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (“ASCO”) in Chicago by pharma bigwigs like Bristol Myers (BMY  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report), among others. JAK inhibitors were in the news this week with Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) finally gaining FDA approval for its rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”) candidate Olumiant (baricitinib) in the United States while AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) presented positive top-line data from its fifth late-stage study on upadacitinib in RA.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesUpdate from ASCO: Merck stole the show at ASCO after presenting data from several cancer studies of its PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda. Key presentations were from two pivotal lung cancer trials. KEYNOTE-042 study evaluated Keytruda monotherapy in newly-diagnosed lung cancer patients while KEYNOTE-407 study evaluated Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy in difficult-to treat squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Both the studies showed that treatment with Keytruda led to improved survival. Particularly, data from the KEYNOTE- 407 study, which evaluated Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC was considered “practice changing” by investors.Four and five years follow-up data presented from two advanced melanoma studies showed that treatment with Keytruda led to long-term survival benefit. Interim data from a cohort of a phase II study, KEYNOTE-158, evaluating Keytruda as a monotherapy in patients with previously treated advanced small cell lung cancer (SCLC) demonstrated encouraging response rates in the overall population of SCLC patients as well as in patients whose tumors express PD-L1. Keytruda also demonstrated encouraging ORR in studies evaluating the Lenvima/Keytruda combination in four different tumor types and Keytruda monotherapy for the first-line treatment of advanced clear cell RCC.Bristol-Myers and Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) presented preliminary data from a mid-stage study evaluating NKTR-214 in combination with Bristol-Myers’PD-L1 inhibitor, Opdivo in several tumor types. The response rates in melanoma and kidney cancer patients did not impress investors, resulting in a 42% drop in Nektar’s stock on Monday.  (Read more: Nektar and Bristol-Myers Present Data on Cancer Study)Bristol-Myers also presented data on Opdivo at ASCO. In a late-stage study evaluating Opdivo versus Yervoy in a broad range of patients with resected stage III or IV melanoma, Opdivo demonstrated sustained, superior recurrence-free survival versus Yervoy. In another study, Opdivo plus chemotherapy showed improved PFS versus chemotherapy in first-line lung cancer patients with PD-L1 expression <1%.Novartis (NVS) announced positive data from a combination study on breast cancer drug Kisqali and from two long-term leukemia studies on Tasigna. (Read more: Novartis Announces Positive Data on Kisqali and Tasigna).Roche presented data from a late-stage study, which showed that Tecentriq (atezolizumab) plus chemotherapy reduced the risk of disease worsening or death (PFS) by 29% in advanced squamous NSCLC patients versus chemotherapy alone.AbbVie presented early data from a phase II study evaluating a combination of its cancer drugs Imbruvica plus Venclexta (venetoclax) for the first-line treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The data demonstrated high rates of responses in such patients. Also, interim data from a late-stage study evaluating Imbruvica plus Roche’s Rituxan in Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, a rare form of Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, showed that the combination significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 80% compared to placebo plus Rituxan.Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), AstraZeneca and J&J also made some cancer data presentations at the meeting.Lilly Gets FDA Nod for Lower Dose of Olumiant: Eli Lilly and partner Incyte gained FDA approval for the lower dose of (2 mg) of the companies’ JAK inhibitor, Olumiant. The FDA did not approve the higher dose (4 mg) and the drug’s label was approved with a boxed warning stating risk of serious infections, malignancies and thrombosis. Olumiant is already marketed in Europe and Japan and generated sales of $32.2 million in the first quarter of 2018. In the United States, Lilly faced significant trouble in getting FDA nod for Olumiant. In April last year, the FDA had issued a complete response letter for the new drug application seeking approval of Olumiant, requesting additional information to determine the most appropriate doses. This year in April, an FDA advisory committee had recommended approval of the lower dose of the drug while not recommending the higher dose of 4 mg on inadequate safety profile to support an approval relative to its benefits. (Read more: Eli Lilly's Olumiant Gets FDA Nod for Rheumatoid Arthritis).AbbVie’s 5th Late-Stage Upadacitinib Study Succeeds: AbbVie’s oral JAK-1 selective inhibitor, upadacitinib, met all primary as well as secondary endpoints in the fifth phase III study from its SELECT program. Top-line data from the study showed thata significantly higher proportion of patients treated with upadacitinib in both 15 and 30 mg doses achieved superior responses compared to chemotherapy agent methotrexate. AbbVie plans to submit regulatory applications for upadacitinib in rheumatoid arthritis in the second half of the year.  (Read more: Abbvie’s Upadacitinib Fifth RA Study Data Positive)Allergan Under Activist Pressure to Split CEO-Chairman Roles: Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) was under pressure this week after two hedge-fund firms, Senator Investment Group and Appaloosa, disclosed a letter urging the company to engage in a management and board overhaul. The firms asked the pharmaceutical company to split its chairman and chief executive roles, both presently held by Brent Saunders, among other management changes. Appaloosa run by David Tepper and Senator Investment Group run by Douglas Silverman, suggested an outsider should be hired for either of the roles. The letter comes on the heels of Allergan’s strategic plan announced last week to divest its women's health and infectious disease units. Allergan responded by saying that the board has been refreshed with the addition of three members in the last 16 months. (Read more: Allergan Requests Shareholders to Veto Management Change).Glaxo Completes Buyout of Novartis’ Stake in Consumer Healthcare JV: Glaxo announced that it has completed its previously announced deal to buy out Novartis’ 36.5% stake in the Consumer HealthCare joint venture for $13 billion (£9.2 billion),With the acquisition of Novartis’ stake, Glaxo now has 100% ownership of its Consumer Healthcare unit, which includes products such as Sensodyne and Flonase.

1951,PFE,"Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (KERX  -  Free Report) is expected to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 3, before the market opens.Last quarter the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 44.44%. Keryx’s performance over the last four quarters has been disappointing. The company reported a wider-than-expected loss in the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 25.57%.Keryx’s shares have lost 0.9% year to date, compared with the industry’s 9.9% decline. Factors Influencing This QuarterApart from license fees, Keryx’s top line comprises revenues generated by its only marketed product Auryxia (ferric citrate). Auryxia is used to treat patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis.In November 2017, the FDA granted an approval for an additional indication of Auryxia to treat adults with iron deficiency anemia (“IDA”) and chronic kidney disease, not on dialysis. Moreover, Keryx claims that Auryxia is the only oral treatment option available for this indication. Auryxia is already approved to control serum phosphorus levels in adults with chronic kidney disease on dialysis. With the latest approval, this drug can treat two complications of chronic kidney disease.  It also represents a significant opportunity for physicians to treat their patients at an earlier stage of the disease before their anemia becomes more severe. Hence, the approval should significantly boost Auryxia’s sales.Meanwhile, the company is looking for potential partners to commercialize the drug in the EU. Ferric citrate has been considered as a new active substance by the European Commission. This provides it with 10 years of data and marketing exclusivity in the region.The company also remains focused on creating rapid awareness for the new indication and differentiating Auryxia from existing treatment options along with communicating the favorable insurance access to Auryxia that prescribers and patients can expect to see.Further, the company supports a number of ongoing trials, including several investigator-sponsored clinical studies, and one new phase IV study called COMPASS. The COMPASS study will continue to expand the clinical dataset for Auryxia as a treatment for iron deficiency anemia by studying it in people who haven't been treated previously with low iron and in different dosing regimens such as twice-a-day.However, with Auryxia being the only approved product in Keryx’s portfolio, the company is entirely dependent on Auryxia for growth. What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model does not show an earnings beat for Keryx this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.

1952,PFE,"With the tax filing deadline of April 17 a few days away, investors still have some time to make contributions to their individual retirement accounts (IRAs) for the 2017 tax year.IRAs allow investors to buy individual stocks, bonds, ETFs or mutual funds.  ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with investors due to their low cost, transparency and tax efficiency.ETFs are excellent tools for retirement investors as well since they provide an easy way to build a diversified portfolio at a low cost. Further, income paying ETFs are better placed in an IRA as income is sheltered from taxes.Before investing for retirement, investors need to assess their investing goals, time horizon and risk tolerance. (Read: Earnings Weighted ETFs to Tap 7 Year Growth)Investors need to remember that performance of an investment portfolio depends mostly on asset allocation, i.e. how an investor allocates money among major asset classes such as stocks, bonds, alternative assets and cash.Low-cost, broad, diversified funds are more suitable for retirement investors as core, long-term investments rather than costly, narrow-focused or niche ETFs, which should mainly be used as shorter-term tactical trading vehicle.Expense ratio of an ETF should be an important consideration in retirement investing, as in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same. (Read: 5 ETF Ways to Hedge Your Portfolio Against Volatility)Here are some ETFs that are excellent long-term investments for retirement accounts:iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF (ITOT  -  Free Report)ITOT is a convenient way to get exposure to the entire US stock universe, ranging from some of the smallest to largest companies at an extremely low cost of just 3 basis points.It holds more than 3,600 stocks in its basket and should be a core holding in any long-term focused portfolio. Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) are its top holdings.iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF (DGRO  -  Free Report)The product holds companies that have a history of consistently growing their dividends and are likely to continue growing dividends. Holdings are weighted by dividend dollars.I believe that companies with uninterrupted dividend growth record usually have solid balance sheets and strong cash flows. So, these strategies outperform the market over time and also provide stability and downside protection during market downturns, in addition to growing income streams.   The ETF doesn’t have a lot of exposure to rate sensitive sectors and would be a good choice for investors worried about the rising rate environment.It has a low expense ratio of 0.08%. Johnson& Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) are top holdings.

1953,PFE,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that a late-stage study on its kidney cancer drug Inlyta (axitinib) failed to demonstrate a clear improvement in the primary endpoint of extending disease-free survival (DFS). Accordingly, an independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended the study be stopped at a planned interim analysis. Detailed data from the study will be presented at a future medical meeting.The phase III ATLAS study was evaluating Inlyta versus placebo as an adjuvant therapy for patients with high risk of recurrent renal cell carcinoma (RCC), a type of kidney cancer, following surgical removal of one or both kidneys.Shares of Pfizer have risen 0.2% so far this year, comparing favorably with a 2.3% decrease for the industry.Inlyta is presently marketed for the second-line treatment of patients with advanced RCC. If the ATLAS study was successful, then Inlyta would be able to cater to an expanded patient population - kidney cancer patients who are in the earlier stage of this disease.Inlyta generated sales of $339 million in 2017, a decline of 15% from 2016.Meanwhile, Inlyta is being evaluated in two independent global phase III studies in combination with Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) PD-L1 inhibitor Keytruda and its own PD-L1 inhibitor Bavencio (avelumab), respectively – each compared with Sutent in first-line advanced RCC. These studies continue to be unmodified.Bavencio is currently approved in metastatic MCC, a rare and aggressive skin cancer, in the United States, Europe and Japan and for the second-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (accelerated approval) in the United States.Pfizer has developed Bavencio in partnership with the German company, Merck KGaA . Meanwhile, avelumab is being developed for different types of cancer. The avelumab PD-L1 program has several studies ongoing, both as monotherapy and in combination with other portfolio assets.Zacks Rank & Key PickPfizer carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Another top-ranked large-cap pharma stock is GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) with the same Zacks Rank as Pfizer.Shares of Glaxo have returned 17.5% this year so far.

1954,PFE,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) announced encouraging data from the phase III CheckMate -214 study on Opdivo.CheckMate-214 study is an ongoing study evaluating   Immuno-Oncology combination Opdivo (nivolumab) and low-dose (1mg/kg) Yervoy (ipilimumab) compared with  Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Sutent (sunitinib) in intermediate- and poor-risk patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) over a two-year follow-up period.  The treatment with Opdivo plus low-dose Yervoy led to statistically significant differences in patient-reported outcomes from baseline versus sunitinib through two years of follow-up. The study demonstrated that patients showed significant benefits in disease-related symptoms and improvements to their cancer-related quality of life and well-being.These benefits occurred early during Opdivo plus low-dose Yervoy combination therapy and were largely maintained throughout the treatment period and through Opdivo maintenance therapy.The CheckMate-214 study for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma had earlier shown efficacy benefit of Opdivo plus low-dose Yervoy across a number of measures, including overall survival, objective response rate and progression-free survival. However, the results presented now showed that patients treated with this Immuno-Oncology combination also reported significant improvements in disease-related symptoms, as well as positive changes to their physical, emotional and functional well-being.An additional analysis showed similar results with a significant benefit seen for Opdivo plus low-dose Yervoy relative to sunitinib on change from baseline at a pre-planned 25-week landmark.Bristol-Myers’ shares have declined 16% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 4.4%.We note that, Opdivo, became the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to gain regulatory approval in July 2014. It is currently approved in several countries including the United States, the EU and Japan for several cancer indications. Opdivo became the first PD-1 inhibitor to be approved for a hematological malignancy — classical Hodgkin lymphoma in both the United States (May 2016) and the EU (November 2016).In November 2016, Opdivo gained FDA approval for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy.Meanwhile, the company continues to evaluate Opdivo alone or in combination therapies with Yervoy and other anti-cancer agents. Label expansion of the drug into additional indications would give the product an access to a higher patient population and increase its commercial potential significantly.However, Opdivo is facing competitive challenges in the United States. With the FDA approving Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda, for the first-line treatment of metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the company is expected to suffer further loss of market share.In a separate release, Bristol-Myers announced that the FDA lifted a partial clinical hold placed on CA209-602 (CheckMate -602), a phase III study evaluating the addition of Opdivo to pomalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The decision follows consultation with the FDA and agreement on amendments to the study protocol.The FDA put clinical hold on three studies evaluating Opdivo-based combinations in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in September 2017 as an FDA precaution following risks identified in trials studying another anti–PD-1 agent, Keytruda, in patients with multiple myeloma. Stocks That Warrant a LookBristol-Myers carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock from the same space is Illumina, Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank#1 (Strong Buy),.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Illumina’s earnings per share estimates have moved up from $4.83 to $4.86 for 2018 and from $5.57 to $5.60 for 2019 over the past 30 days.

1955,PFE,"Investors are keenly awaiting earnings results from both Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report). The main reason is that Merck KGaA's consumer healthcare division was acquired by Procter & Gamble Co. (PG  -  Free Report) last month for $4.2 billion or €3.4 billion. Following the acquisition, the focus shifted toward Pfizer as Procter & Gamble was expected to acquire the consumer healthcare business unit of the former.Meanwhile, the healthcare sector has jumped 9.9% in the past year, becoming one of the best performing sectors among the S&P 500. Signs of the sector’s well-being became more evident in the last one year, when the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index and the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index gained 2.9% and 4.6%, respectively.With both Merck and Pfizer are scheduled to report on May 1, this may be a good time to figure out which of these is a better stock. Both pharma giants carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other major earnings scheduled on the same day include Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and BP p.l.c. (BP  -  Free Report). Price PerformanceMerck has witnessed a decline of 4.7% over the past year, while Pfizer has advanced 8.3%. So Pfizer is a clear winner in this respect with better returns than both rival Merck and the broader industry, which rose 4% during the same period.Dividend YieldIn a year’s time, Merck and Pfizer have offered dividend yields of 3.22% and 3.71%, respectively, while the industry’s dividend yield is 3.25%. So Pfizer has taken lead here too, compared to both Merck and the broader industry.Net MarginThe pharmaceutical industry enjoys higher profit margins than several other sectors. This is possibly one of the reasons why critics of the sector continually draw attention to allegedly exorbitant drug pricing, which helps the sector maintain its steep margins.With a net margin value of 30.61%, Pfizer performs better than rival Merck, which has a net margin value of 27.25%. In comparison, the broader industry has a net margin value of 26.23%.Debt-to-Equity RatioThe debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is a good indicator of the financial health of a company and is a good proxy for its debt-servicing capacity. In the context of a capital-intensive industry like pharma, this is an indicator of a company’s long-term sustainability.Merck’s debt-to-equity ratio of 61.8% is significantly high, compared with the industry’s D/E ratio of 56%.  With a comparatively lower D/E ratio of 46.8%, Pfizer evidently has a better leverage condition.ValuationThe most appropriate ratio to evaluate these two drug makers is perhaps EV/EBITDA. This metric is usually used to compare two stocks in the same industry. It is superior to other metrics such as P/E because it is not affected by the different capital structures of the two companies.Coming to the two pharma majors, Pfizer with an EV/EBITDA ratio of 16.42 is overvalued than the broader industry, which has an EV/EBITDA value of 11.80. On the other hand, with an EV/EBITDA ratio of 8.38, Merck is underpriced than both Pfizer and the industry.Earnings History and ESPConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history, Merck has delivered positive surprises in each of the prior four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 8.5%. In comparison, Pfizer delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 5% in the prior four quarters, registering an earnings beat each time.When considering Earnings ESP, Merck and Pfizer have ESP values of 0.00% and +1.36%, respectively, which implies that Pfizer is at advantage in this respect. Moreover, Pfizer’s earnings estimates for the current year have advanced by 0.3% over the last 60 days, slightly better than Merck’s 0.2% increase. ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that Merck holds an edge over Pfizer when considering only EV/EBITDA ratios and previous earnings performance. However, when considering price performance, leverage position, net margins and estimate revisions, Pfizer holds an advantage over Merck. Additionally, Pfizer has a better dividend yield than Merck, making it a clearly better stock.What clinches the case in favor of Pfizer at this point of time is that it has a positive and better ESP than Merck, which is a leading indicator of a likely positive surprise. This is why it may be better to bet on Pfizer over Merck as both prepare to report earnings next week.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1956,PFE,"The Dow rebounded strongly this week after trade war fears receded and tech stocks staged a recovery. Markets declined on Monday after uncertainty over a prospective trade war weighed on investor sentiment. However, the Dow registered strong gains over the next three trading days, registering its first three-session stretch of gains since Feb 26. Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow increased 1.1% last Thursday, driven by a rebound in tech majors. Intel Inc. INTC gained the most, increasing 5%. Shares of Facebook Inc. (FB  -  Free Report), Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Netflix Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) gained 4.4%, 0.8%, 3.4%, 3.2% and 1.1%, respectively.Microsoft Corp. (MSFT  -  Free Report) also gained 2.1% after the company established two separate engineering teams, one for experiences and devices and another for cloud and AI platforms.The index gained 2.7% over last week. Markets staged a powerful rebound on last Monday as tensions of an ensuing trade war between the United States and China appeared to ease. However, on last Tuesday markets declined sharply due to the tech tumble.Additionally, the index decreased 3.5% during the month of March. The decline was primarily attributable to President Trump’s decision to impose $60 billion of tariffs Chinese imports, giving rise to fears of an ensuing trade war. The Dow also lost 2.3% in the first quarter of 2018.The Dow This WeekThe index declined 1.9% on Monday due to uncertainty about a global trade war. Technology and Internet stocks continue to suffer following President Trump’s renewed attack on Amazon. Monday’s broad-based market selloff was the worst start to April since the Great Depression of 1929.All 30 components of the blue-chip index closed below their 50-day moving average. The major loser for the blue-chip index was Intel which plunged 6.1% following a Bloomberg report that Apple would use its own chips for Mac computers instead of Intel’s chips.The index gained 1.7% on Tuesday led by a partial turnaround in technology stocks. Amazon gained 1.5% following a Bloomberg report, citing sources that the government is not planning to impose any regulations on the company.Although the recovery was broad-based, investors’ anxiety over an impending trade war and imposition of new regulations on technology and Internet stocks persisted.The index gained 1% on Wednesday with 27 of its 30 components closing in the green. Markets opened sharply lower yesterday on trade war related concerns. However, they recovered subsequently to a great extent after the White House gave indication that the U.S. government doesn’t want to enter into a trade war with China.The blue-chip index rebounded from 510 points or 2.1% plunge to finish the session up about 231 points. Consequently, Dow registered its best single-session comeback since, Feb 6, when the blue-chip slipped 2.3% to end up 2.3%.The index gained 1% on Thursday, finishing in the green on the third consecutive day for the first time since Feb 26. Fears of an impending trade war seemed to ebb. A semblance of stability seemed to have returned to proceedings since Wednesday’s notable turnaround.The Dow added more than 200 stocks with The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and DowDuPont Inc. DWDP emerging as its best performers, adding 2.7% and 2.8%, respectively. Overall, tech stocks were the leading gainers for the day with Facebook, Netflix and Amazon increasing 2.7%, 1.7% and 2.9%, respectively.Components Moving the Index Boeing recently entered into an agreement with the second largest Indian-based airline — Jet Airways — for delivering 75 737 MAX narrow body aircrafts, per Reuters. The deal is in line with Indian airlines’ latest rush to expand their fleets to meet the rising demand in the country for both domestic and international flights.The deal value amounts to approximately $8.8 billion at current list prices which might get lower once the deal finalizes, as airlines typically receive a significant discount on big orders from manufacturers.However, it is still unknown whether the agreement was a formal order or a non-binding memorandum of understanding.

1958,PFE,"Total earnings for 83.1% of the total healthcare market capitalization are up 14.7% on revenue growth of 8.1%. The growth rates seem unimpressive when compared with some of the other sectors. Earnings and revenue beat ratios of 88.9% and 75%, respectively, are also not great either.Among the most notable players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) was the first major drug company to report earnings on Apr 17, followed by Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) on Apr 24 and Apr 26, respectively. Other major U.S. drug companies — Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) — reported on May 1. These industry bigwigs came up with earnings or revenue beat or both.Earnings in FocusJohnson and JohnsonThe world's biggest maker of healthcare products continued its long streak of earnings beat. Earnings per share came in at $2.06, 5 cents ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and 12.6% higher than the year-ago quarter. Revenues grew 12.9% year over year to $20.01 billion and edged past the estimated $19.4 billion. Johnson & Johnson raised its revenue guidance from $80.60-$81.40 billion to $81.0-$81.8 billion but maintained its earnings per share outlook of $8.00-$8.20, which reflects growth of 6.8%-9.6% (read: Healthcare ETFs in Focus After Johnson & Johnson Q1 Earnings).PfizerThe U.S. drug giant surpassed earnings estimates but lagged on revenues. Earnings per share of 77 cents came in 3 cents above the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues of $12.9 billion fell shy of the estimated $13.1 billion. On an annual basis, earnings per share and revenues rose 12% and 1%, respectively. For 2018, Pfizer expects revenues in the range of $53.5-$55.5 billion and earnings per share of $2.90-$3.00.MerckMerck also beat earnings estimates but missed on revenues. Earnings per share came in at $1.05, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 99 cents and improving 19.3% from the year-ago quarter.

1959,PFE,"The Dow endured a particularly tough week, ending with marginal gains for the first time only on Thursday. During the early half of the week, strong earnings results failed to boost investor sentiment. Trade and inflation related fears weighed on investors over most of the week. The Fed refrained from raising rates but market watchers remained concerned over its future actions.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow decreased 0.1% on last Friday after gaining over two consecutive winning sessions. Strong earnings results from large-cap technology and Internet boosted investors’ sentiment in the mid-day trading.However, the markets shed most of their gains as soft U.S. GDP data and tepid earnings reports from energy sector tumbled the stocks. The blue-chip index fell in the negative territory primarily due to tepid earnings results from Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report).The Dow lost 0.6% over last week. Investors remain concerned that iPhone sales may come in below expectations in the second quarter. Meanwhile, Caterpillar Inc.’s (CAT  -  Free Report) forecast that economic growth might decelerate later this year also dampened investor sentiment. A spike in Treasury yield also weighed on broader markets.The Dow This WeekThe index declined 0.6% on Monday as a broad-based decline pushed all the three major indexes in red. Slide into the healthcare and industrial stocks more than offset gains from several merger and acquisitions (M&A) except a telecom mega deal. Moreover, strong first quarter earnings results also failed to uplift investor sentiment.The Dow gained 0.3% during the month of April. Strong earnings results by most of the large U.S. corporates failed to encourage investors. Disappointing guidance by Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM  -  Free Report), the largest contract chipmaker worldwide, led to losses for tech majors. Rising bond yields also dented investors’ confidence.The index lost 0.3% on Tuesday with 9 of the 30-stocks in the index closing in the green while 20 traded in the red. During the trading session, the blue-chip index was once down 1%, nearly touching its lowest close since April 2.The index declined 0.7% on Wednesday. Markets were up in the early hours of trading buoyed by the Fed’s decision to keep monetary policy unchanged. However, the broader-market lost momentum later in the day on news of further escalation of the U.S.-China trade conflict. Strong earnings results from Apple also failed to boost market sentiment as investors remain concerned about inflationary pressures.The index gained 0.02% on Thursday even as investors remained uneasy ahead of Friday’s official jobs report. Earlier in the day, the Dow was down by nearly 400 points, moving below its 200-day moving average, the first such occurrence since early April. However, it recovered subsequently to post marginal gains as fears related to trade and uncertainty over the Fed’s future actions weighed on sentiment. Components Moving the Index Apple Inc.

1960,PFE,"We expect AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.78%.Shares of AbbVie have marginally outperformed the industry so far this year. While the stock has declined 4.1%, the industry has decreased 4.3%. Notably, AbbVie’s earnings history is quite impressive with the pharmaceuticals company having outpaced estimates in all the last four quarters with an average beat of 1.81%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Factors to ConsiderAbbVie expects first-quarter 2018 earnings in the range of $1.77-$1.79 per share. Revenues are estimated to grow in a mid-teen range on an operational basis. Foreign exchange is anticipated to gain a 3% favorable impact on sales in the period to be reported.The company’s key drug, Humira, is likely to remain a key growth driver in the first quarter, backed by strong demand trends for the drug. AbbVie expects Humira sales to reflect a rise in the low-teens band in the imminent earnings release while internationally, the growth rate is projected in a mid-single-digit range, operationally. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Humira is pegged at $4.7 billion.Significantly, on first-quarter conference call, investors’ focus will also be on the performance level as well as the label expansion updates of AbbVie’s another cancer drug, Imbruvica. The drug has been recording strong sales since the past few quarters, a trend that we expect to continue even in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Imbruvica stands at $759 million.Other drugs, namely Duopa and Creon are also likely to maintain an encouraging performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.However, AbbVie’s Hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment, Viekira, will continue to see declining sales, affected by an intense pricing and competitive pressure in the HCV market.Moreover, in March 2018, AbbVie’s rovalpituzumab tesirine or Rova-T fell short of expectations in a phase II TRINITY study, evaluating it in third-line therapy for later small cell lung cancer (SCLC). On first-quarter conference call, we expect management to provide updates on the same.Notably, AbbVie’s eight-week, pan-genotypic, ribavirin-free, once-daily HCV treatment, Mavyret, secured an approval in the United States, EU, Canada as well as Japan in the second half of 2017. Importantly, Mavyret recorded $500 million global sales last year. The initial uptake of the drug has been commendable and we expect its higher sales in the first quarter as well.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that the stock is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.Zacks ESP: AbbViehas an Earnings ESP of +0.06%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is $1.80 per share. A positive ESP indicates a likely earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: AbbViehas a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and together with a positive ESP, chances of the stock beating estimates in its upcoming release are always pegged higher.We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a couple of other health care stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to also surpass estimates this time around:Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on May 1. The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.36% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report earnings on Apr 26. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.82% and a Zacks Rank of 3.Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) is slated to announce financial figures on May 4. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.63% and is a Zacks #3 Ranked player.AbbVie Inc. Price and EPS Surprise AbbVie Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | AbbVie Inc.

1961,PFE,"We expect Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 30, before market open. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.78%.Allergan’s share price has declined 2.3% this year so far, compared with the industry’s decline of 5.8%.Allergan’s earnings performance has been strong, with the company beating expectations in each of the past four quarters. The average positive earnings surprise over the last four quarters is 1.81%.Allergan plc Price and EPS Surprise  Allergan plc Price and EPS Surprise | Allergan plc QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderOn the fourth-quarter 2017 conference call, the company guided first-quarter 2018 revenues  between $3.5 billion and $3.6 billion while earnings per share are expected to be between $3.20 and $3.40. These numbers indicate the lowest revenue and earnings quarter for the year.In the fourth quarter of 2017, the favorable timing of physician rebating program benefited sales of Allergan’s facial aesthetics products. This benefit was absent in the first quarter of 2018, which will hurt revenues. As such, the company expects first-quarter revenue growth rate to be somewhat lower than the annual 2018 growth rate. Also, generic competition for Estrace and Namenda XR will hurt sales sharply in the first quarter.While a generic version of Namenda XR was launched by Indian company, Lupin in February that of Estrace cream was launched by Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) in January.Allergan expects a generic version of Restasis, its second best-selling drug, to be launched between April and July of 2018. Meanwhile, a generic version of Delzicol is expected to be launched in early second-quarter 2018.Investor focus on the call will be on management’s comments on the potential impact of generic competition on key growth drivers, Restasis and Namenda XR. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Restasis is $295 million.Nonetheless, Allergan’s established products like Botox, Linzess, Lo Loestrin and Juvéderm collection of fillers and new products like Juvéderm collection of fillers should support sales in Q1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Botox is $771 million.In fact, recent label expansions for Botox (FDA approval for forehead line treatment) and Vraylar (FDA approval for maintenance treatment of schizophrenia) and Avycaz (FDA approval for HABP/VABP) should add to sales of these drugs in Q1. Meanwhile, the addition of Alloderm from LifeCell (January 2017) and CoolSculpting body contouring system from Zeltiq (April 2017) acquisitions should continue to support the top line in the quarter.However, we believe sales erosion of Aczone due to generic pressure on the branded acne category and loss of exclusivity (LOE), mainly from Asacol HD and Minastrin 24, will continue to hurt the top line.We remind investors that on the Q4 call, the company had said that it does not expect any significant M&A activities in 2018. Allergan expects to reevaluate its M&A strategy in the second half of the year once it gets through the LOEs. An update is expected at the upcoming conference call.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Allergan is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate ($3.37 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($3.36 per share) is +0.14%. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Allergan has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Allergan’s Zacks Rank #3 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some large-cap health care stocks worth considering per our model. These also have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.82% and a Zacks Rank of 2. The company is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings on Apr 26. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) is also slated to announce financial figures on May 1. The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.36% and is also a Zacks #2 Ranked stock.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1962,PFE,"Eli Lilly & Company (LLY  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share of $1.34, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.13 per share by 18.6%. Earnings rose 37% from the year-ago quarter backed by robust volume-driven growth in new product sales and lower operating costs and tax rates.Including asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges, first-quarter earnings per share were $1.16 against a loss of 10 cents in the first-quarter of 2017.Revenues in DetailQuarterly revenues of $5.70 billion also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.53 billion. Sales grew 9% year over year backed by strong performance of new drugs and favorable currency movement, which made up for lower sales of established products like Strattera, Cialis and Forteo.Volumes rose 2% as increased demand for new products like Trulicity, Cyramza, Taltz, Basaglar, Jardiance and Lartruvo offset decline in sales of some established products. However, volume growth was softer than 4% in the previous quarter.Higher realized prices for several drugs contributed 3% to sales growth in the quarter. Foreign exchange rate also had a favorable impact of 4%.While U.S. revenues grew 8% to $3.16 billion, ex-U.S. revenues rose 11% to $2.55 billion.Pharmaceutical revenues rose 11% in the quarter. However, decreased demand for food animal products continued to hurt sales in Lilly’s Animal Health segment.Established products that recorded growth during the quarter include Humalog (up 12% year over year to $791.7 million), Humulin (up 4% to $325.9 million) and Trajenta (up 25% to $141.1 million). Sales of all other established products declined in the quarter.Forteo sales declined 10% to $313.2 million due to decreased volume from unfavorable wholesale and retail buying patterns in the United States.Cymbalta sales declined 3% to $169.6 million while Erbitux sales declined 3% to $149.6 million.Alimta sales rose 2% to $499.6 million as higher sales in United States offset sales decline in international markets. In ex-U.S. markets, sales declined 3% to $254.3 million due to competitive pressure and loss of exclusivity in certain countries. However, sales of Alimta increased 8% to $245.3 million in the United States due to increased volume and higher realized prices.Zyprexa sales declined 17% to $122.6 million due to loss of exclusivity in Japan.Cialis sales declined 7% to $495.4 million hurt by lower demand in United States and loss of exclusivity in Europe.Strattera sales declined 33% to $130.7 million due to loss of exclusivity.Among the new products, Trulicity generated revenues of $678.3 million, up 82% year over year, with U.S. revenues benefiting from growth in the GLP-1 market and market share gains.Cyramza revenues were $183.6 million, up 7% year over year, backed by strong demand. Cyramza’s ex-U.S. revenues increased 10%, benefiting from strong volumes and currency benefit, partially offset by lower realized prices. U.S. revenues increased 3% driven by increased volume and higher realized prices.Jardiance sales surged 104% to $151 million, driven by increased market share within the growing SGLT2 class in the United States and increased volume outside the United States.Basaglar recorded revenues of $166.0 million compared with $153.8 million in the previous quarter. It generated revenues of $126.7 million in the United States, which improved sequentially driven by increased demand as the drug gained Medicare Part D formulary access.Taltz brought in sales of $146.5 million compared with $172.5 million in the previous quarter as higher ex-U.S. revenues were offset by lower U.S. sales, which were hurt by unfavorable specialty pharmacy buying patterns.Lartruvo (olaratumab) generated revenues of $64.4 million in the quarter compared with $59.0 million in the previous quarter.Olumiant (baricitinib) has been launched in select European countries and in Japan for moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis. The drug generated sales of $32.2 million in the quarter backed by strong launch uptake in Germany, compared with $23.0 million in the previous quarter.The drug is under review in the United States. Lilly and partner Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) re-submitted the NDA for baricitinib in January. In a setback to the company, on Monday, Lilly informed that the FDA Advisory Committee has recommended approval of the 2-mg dose of the JAK inhibitor while not recommending the higher dose of 4-mg on the ground that its safety profile is not adequate to support an approval relative to its benefits. The final decision from the FDA is expected in June this year. Please note that in April last year, the FDA had issued a complete response letter (CRL) for the new drug application (NDA) for baricitinib on safety concerns.Verzenio, which was launched in the Unites States in the fourth quarter of 2017, generated sales of $29.7 million in the quarter compared with $21 million in the previous quarter.Elanco Animal Health segment sales declined 1% to $761.3 million due to decreased demand for food animal products.Lilly is exploring strategic alternatives for this business including a sale, merger or creating a separate company through an initial public offer. A decision regarding the same is expected to be announced in July. Lilly might ultimately opt to retain the business.Gross Margin & Operating Income Adjusted gross margin of 75.1% in the quarter decreased 270 basis points as manufacturing efficiencies and higher realized prices were offset by negative product mix and the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold.Operating income increased 29% year over year to $1.60 billion due to lower operating costs. Total operating expenses (including research and development and marketing, selling and administrative expenses), as a percent of revenues, declined 710 basis points in the quarter to 46.9% due to the company’s cost saving efforts.2018 EPS Guidance UppedLilly raised its previously issued outlook for adjusted earnings as well as sales.Adjusted earnings per share are now expected in the range of $5.10 to $5.20, higher than $4.81 to $4.91 expected previously, to reflect the expected benefit from higher operating profits and lower tax rates.The revenue range was also slightly upped to $23.7 billion to $24.2 billion from $23.0 billion to $23.5 billion expected previously.Gross margin is expected to be approximately 75%, same as previously expected. Adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 17% (previously approximately 18%).Marketing, selling and administrative expense guidance was tightened to a range of $6.2–$6.3 billion compared with $6.1–$6.4 billion previously. Research and development expense guidance was slightly increased to a range of $5.2–$5.4 billion compared with $5.0–$5.2 billion previously due to increased funding requirement for pipeline development.Our TakeLilly’s first-quarter results were impressive as it beat estimates for both earnings and sales and also raised its 2018 guidance for both metrics. Shares of the drug giant rose more than 2% in pre-market trading.However, year-to-date, Lilly’s shares have declined 5% compared with the industry’s decline of 4.7%.Going forward, Lilly’s new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Cyramza, Jardiance, Lartruvo, Verzenio and Olumiant are expected to continue to drive revenues.However, competitive pressure on Lilly’s drugs is expected to rise this year. Challenges remain for the company in the form of loss of patent exclusivity for products like Cialis this year and the impact of generic competition for Strattera, Effient and Axiron. The latest baricitinib setback was a disappointment.Lilly carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1963,PFE,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before the opening bell.In the last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, Alexion’s track record is excellent as it has consistently topped estimates in the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 15.21%.Alexion’s shares have underperformed the industry in the past  year. The stock has lost 9.9% compared with the industry’s decline of 8.3%. What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that Alexion is likely to beat on earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — which have a significantly higher chance of beating estimates.Zacks ESP: Alexion has an Earnings ESP of +2.09% as the Most Accurate estimate is $1.51 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.48. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Alexion’s Zacks Rank #2, when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Note that Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Likely to Impact Q1 ResultsAlexion’s blockbuster drug, Soliris, continues to perform well. Alexion continues to identify and treat a consistently high number of new patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) with Soliris, across its 50-country operating platform.Alexion is working on expanding Soliris’ label into additional indications. The FDA recently approved the drug for the treatment of refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive. The drug was approved in Europe for this indication. Approximately 60,000-80,000 patients are expected to have gMG in the United States.Additionally, a phase III study (PREVENT) on Soliris in patients with relapsing neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder is ongoing with enrollment was completed and data expected in mid-2018. Label expansion in additional indications will give Soliris access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug significantly.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Soliris hints that the drug’s sales will increase to about 8.2% from the year-ago quarter to $803 million.Alexion recently announced that it will acquire Sweden-based Wilson Therapeutics for $855 million. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter. The acquisition will add a late-stage candidate, WTX101 to Alexion’s pipeline. The candidate is currently in phase III for the treatment of Wilson disease, a rare genetic disorder.Alexion is looking to diversify its portfolio and reduce its dependence on its blockbuster drug Soliris. The deal will strengthen Alexion’s rare disease pipeline with a late-stage candidate.The company plans to focus on rare diseases businesses in core areas of hematology, nephrology, neurology and metabolic disorders to enhance productivity. Alexion will reduce spending and headcount associated with the previously announced de-prioritized pipeline programs as well as optimizing additional R&D expenses.The company plans to relocate its headquarters to Boston, MA by mid-2018 with approximately 400 positions. As a result of the restructuring plan, the company will reduce its global workforce by approximately 20%. The company expects that the increased financial flexibility will allow it to reinvest approximately $100 million annually into R&D. Alexion expects pretax savings of approximately $250 million by 2019.In the meantime, the company’s efforts to develop its pipeline are impressive, particularly in case of ALXN1210. Currently, it is evaluating ALXN1210 (a longer-acting anti-C5 antibody that inhibits terminal complement) in phase III studies for both PNH and aHUS. A tentative approval for PNH is expected in 2019.Patients are also being dosed in a phase III trial with ALXN1210 administered intravenously every eight weeks in complement inhibitor treatment-naive adolescent and adult patients with aHUS.  The company is expected to complete enrollment in the second quarter and announce the results in the fourth quarter of 2018.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

1964,PFE,"AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) announced that it has secured an FDA approval for the label expansion of its marketed drug, Tagrisso (osimertinib), for first-line treatment of adult patients with locally-advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have EGFR mutations.Notably, Tagrisso is approved in the United States, European Union, Japan and China as second-line treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC, who showed progress following treatment with an EGFR TKI due to the EGFR T790M resistance mutation.Shares of AstraZeneca have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has gained 3.7% versus the industry’s decline of 3.3%. We remind investors that last December, the FDA accepted and granted a priority review to the company’s supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Tagrisso for the aforementioned indication.The FDA nod was based on positive data from the phase III FLAURA study, which compared Tagrisso with the standard-of-care EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in the first-line lung cancer setting.Data from the trial showed that the chance of progression or death risk was reduced by more than half in the Tagrisso arm compared with the commonly-used EGFR inhibitors. The median progression-free survival was 18.9 months for patients on Tagrisso compared with 10.2 months in the comparator arm. Tagrisso was well-tolerated in the trial with a safety profile, consistent with the previous experience.Importantly, a similar application for Tagrisso’s label expansion is under review in the EU as well as Japan with a decision expected in the second half of 2018.Tagrisso registered sales of $955 million in 2017, reflecting growth of 126% from the year-ago period and accounting for 5% of total sales. A potential approval in the first-line setting will further boost the drug’s prospects. However, the lung cancer market is crowded with several companies developing or marketing treatments. While Roche Holding AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) /Astellas’ Tarceva is approved for treating NSCLC, Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) is developing its drug Dacomitinib in a phase III study as a first-line treatment for the indication. Moreover, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) is developing Opdivo as a treatment for NSCLC and AstraZeneca too has Iressa approved for treating NSCLC and is also developing Imfinzi for the same indication.AstraZeneca PLC Price AstraZeneca PLC Price | AstraZeneca PLC Quote Zacks RankAstraZeneca carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(AMGN  -  Free Report) announced that it has received European Commission’s (EC) approval to include overall survival (OS) data from the TOWER study on the label of its BiTE antibody, Blincyto.Blincyto is approved for treatment of patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The TOWER study was conducted to support the conversion of Blincyto's accelerated approval to full approval. The study evaluated the efficacy of Blincyto versus standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy for the treatment of Ph- relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL in adults.Results from a late-stage study showed that median overall survival for patients on Blincyto was 7.7 months compared with 4 months for standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy.Blincyto’s label in the United States already includes OS data from the TOWER study following the approval received from the FDA in July last year. In fact, the inclusion of the OS data has been instrumental in driving sales of the drug higher in the past two quarters. Blincyto sales surged 44% from the year-ago period to $49 million in the first quarter of 2018, reflecting a rise in demandThe inclusion of the OS data on the European label of the drug should further boost sales.We remind investors that Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Besponsa was approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL in June last year in the EU, increasing competition for Blincyto.Amgen’s shares have gained 5.8% so far this year against a 7.2% decrease registered by the industry. Amgen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1966,PFE,"Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AERI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 8, after the market closes. Last quarter, the company reported a wider-than-expected loss.Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. QuoteAerie’s performance over the last four quarters has been mixed. The company incurred a narrower-than-expected loss in two of the trailing four quarters while reporting wider-than-expected loss in the remaining two, with an average negative surprise of 3.12%.Aerie’s shares have returned 32.3% over a year compared with the industry’s 3.8% gain.Factors at PlayAerie’s stock received a major boost in December 2017 with the FDA’s approval of lead candidate, Rhopressa 0.02% for the lowering of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.The news was a significant boost for Aerie given that the company had no approved products in its portfolio. The FDA approval comes two months ahead of the scheduled Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date of Feb 28, 2018.Glaucoma is one of the largest segments in the global ophthalmic market. According to the National Eye Institute, it is estimated that more than 2.7 million individuals in the United States suffer from glaucoma. This number is expected to reach 4.3 million by 2030.Aerie expects Rhopress revenues in the range of $20-$30 million in 2018. The company recently announced that it has launched the drug in the United States. The company has hired all regional sales directors and district managers as well as more than 30 of an expected 100 territory managers.The company expects to gain preferred formulary coverage for the majority of commercial payers for Rhopressa by late 2018 with most of the Medicare Part D coverage expected to commence in 2019. We expect management to throw more light on the drug’s launch during the first-quarter call.Meanwhile, Aerie’s second product candidate, Roclatan (netarsudil/latanoprost ophthalmic solution) 0.02%/0.005% — which is a fixed dose combination of Rhopressa and Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xalatan — achieved primary efficacy endpoint in two phase III registration trials, named Mercury 1 and Mercury 2.The candidate also achieved successful 12-month safety and efficacy results in Mercury 1. The company expects to submit its NDA for Roclatan in second-quarter 2018. Investors will also be focussed on Aerie’s update on the same.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Aerie is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen, which is not the case here:Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 89 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Aerie has a Zacks Rank #3, which is favorable. However, we need to have a positive ESP as well to be confident of an earnings beat.Note, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on May 4.

1970,PFE,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share of 77 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 74 cents by 4.1%. Earnings rose 12% year over year as lower tax rates and share count, due to aggressive share repurchases in the quarter, made up for a weaker sales performance and higher R&D costs.The pharma heavyweight recorded revenues of $12.91 billion, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.09 billion. Revenues however rose 1% from the year-ago quarter on a reported basis due to positive impact of currency changes. Currency movement benefited Pfizer’s first-quarter revenues by 3%. However, on an operational basis, excluding the impact of currency, revenues declined 2% year over year.International revenues rose 8% (up 1% an operational basis) to $6.63 billion. U.S. revenues declined 5% to $6.28 billion.Segment DiscussionPfizer’s reporting segments are Pfizer Innovative Health (IH) and Pfizer Essential Health (EH).Pfizer IH sales grew 6% on a reported basis (up 3% an operational basis) from the year-ago period to $7.83 billion.While Ibrance and Eliquis did well in the quarter, IH segment revenues were hurt by lower sales of Enbrel, Lyrica and Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13. Meanwhile, unfavorable customer buying patterns somewhat hurt sales of Ibrance, Xeljanz and certain other products.Ibrance revenues rose 35% to $933 million in the quarter. Xeljanz sales rose 29% to $326 million. Lyrica sales declined 1% to $1.13 billion. Eliquis alliance revenues and direct sales rose 30% to $765 million. Chantix sales rose 3% to $251 million in the quarter.Revenues from blockbuster prostate cancer drug, Xtandi, added to Pfizer’s portfolio following the September 2016 Medivation acquisition, also contributed to U.S. revenues. Xtandi recorded alliance revenues of $159 million in the quarter compared with $168 million in the previous quarter.This was partially offset by continued decline in revenues from Prevnar 13 in the United States and lower revenues of Enbrel.Enbrel revenues declined 21% to $506 million in key European markets due to biosimilar competition. Pfizer has exclusive rights to Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis(RA) drug, Enbrel, outside the United States and Canada.Global Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 revenues declined 3% to $1.38 billion as higher international sales made up for the decline in the United States. Prevnar 13 revenues tanked 12% in the United States due to lower government purchases than last year for the pediatric indication and continued decline in revenues for the adult indication. However, Prevenar 13 revenues rose 16% in international markets.Revenues from the Consumer Healthcare segment, which Pfizer is considering selling, rose 4% to $905 million. Global Oncology revenues increased 23% to $1.7 billion. Global Vaccine revenues declined 3% to $1.46 billion. Internal Medicine declined 3% to $2.35 billion. The Inflammation & Immunology franchise declined 5% to $869 million. Additionally, the portfolio of Rare Disease rose 2% to $549 million.Pfizer EH segment sales declined 5% (down 9% operationally) to $5.08 billion.EH revenues were hurt by the loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for products, primarily Pristiq in the United States and Lyrica in Europe and lower revenues from legacy Hospira products due to product shortages. Viagra sales declined 46% to $187 million due to generic competition that began in December 2017.However, in the EH business, biosimilars and emerging markets did well in the quarter. Biosimilars revenues rose 53% operationally while emerging markets revenues grew 12% operationally.Pfizer launched Inflectra, a biosimilar version of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) blockbuster RA drug Remicade, in November last year. While Inflectra recorded sales of $55 million in the United States and $145 million globally, other biosimilars brought in sales of $29 million (down 5%) from outside the U.S. markets.Adjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI&A) expenses declined 3% (operationally) in the quarter to $3.29 billion. Adjusted R&D expenses rose 1% to $1.74 billion.In the quarter, Pfizer bought back shares worth $6.1 billion, including $2.1 billion of open-market share repurchases and $4.0 billion in accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in March 2018.2018 GuidanceRevenues are expected in the range of $53.5 billion to $55.5 billion. Adjusted earnings per share are expected in the range of $2.90 - $3.00. At the mid-point, adjusted EPS is expected to increase 11% while revenues are expected to increase 4%.Research and development expenses are likely to be in the range of $7.4–$7.9 billion while SI&A spending is projected in the range of $14.0–$15.0 billion.Adjusted tax rate is expected to be 17% in 2018, 300 basis points less than 20% in 2017 due to expected advantage from U.S. tax reform.Our TakePfizer’s first-quarter results were mixed as it beat estimates for earnings while missing the same for revenues. Meanwhile, it re-affirmed its previously issued guidance for 2018.Shares of Pfizer fell around 2.2% in pre-market trading on lower-than-expected sales in the quarter. The top-line was hurt by declines in sales of key drugs like Lyrica, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13, and Enbrel. Also, loss of exclusivity for some products like Viagra and continued supply shortages in legacy Hospira products hurt revenues.This year so far, Pfizer’s shares have increased 2%, against a decrease of 3.1% for the industry.Pfizer faces top-line headwinds in the form of genericization of key drugs, supply shortages in legacy Hospira products, pricing pressure and rising competition. However, we believe that new products like Ibrance, contribution from acquisitions, cost-cutting efforts, a lower tax rate and share buybacks will help the company achieve its guidance. Pfizer looks well poised to record profit growth in 2018.Pfizer also boasts a strong pipeline and expects approximately 25 to 30 drug approvals over the next five years, including around 15 products that have blockbuster potential.Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1971,PFE,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) is one of the most well-known names in the pharmaceutical sector not just for its medicines and vaccines but also for its consumer healthcare products. This New York-based company is well known for products like Prevnar, Lyrica, Lipitor and Celebrex among others.However, like many of its peers, PFE is facing generic competition and pricing pressure for several products. Other than that lost alliance revenues, supply shortages in legacy Hospira products, pricing pressure and rising competition are hurting the top-line.In this scenario, investor focus remains on late-stage pipeline candidates and their commercial potential and performance of new products apart from the usual top-and bottom-line numbers.The pharma giant has a strong record of earnings surprises. The company’s earnings surpassed expectations in each of the last four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 4.97%.Currently, PFE has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), but that could definitely change following the company’s earnings report which was just released.

1972,PFE,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) has announced initiation of dosing in a phase Ib study, evaluating its mini-dystrophin gene therapy candidate, PF-06939926, for the treatment of boys aged from five to 12 years with duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Notably, DMD is a genetic disease characterized by muscle degeneration and weakness. The company anticipates initial data from the study in the first half of 2019.The phase Ib study is an open-label, non-randomized, ascending dose assessment, to be conducted on approximately 12 boys with DMD. The study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PF-06939926 and also assess muscle strength, quality and function in a given patient population.Shares of Pfizer were up almost 1.5% on Apr 12, following the above news release. However, the stock has gained 7.2% in the past year, marginally underperforming the industry’s increase of 7.4%. We remind investors that PF-06939926 is added to Pfizer’s portfolio following the acquisition of Bamboo Therapeutics in August 2016. The acquisition complements Pfizer’s rare disease portfolio and enhanced its leadership position in gene therapy.Additionally, last year, Pfizer entered into a collaboration agreement with other companies for advancing gene therapy programs. Notably, in May 2017, Pfizer inked agreement deal with Sangamo Therapeutics to develop and commercialize gene therapy programs for Hemophilia A. Meanwhile, last November, the company amended its contract with Spark Therapeutics (ONCE  -  Free Report) to advance a Hemophilia B gene therapy candidate, which is being evaluated in a phase I/II study.Nonetheless, this April 2018, Pfizer announced an alliance with private biotech, Allogene Therapeutics, to expedite the development of its allogeneic CAR-T candidate, UCART19, for the treatment of CD19-expressing hematological malignancies.Notably, DMD is one of the most common fatal genetic disorders affecting children around the world. It is a devastating and incurable muscle-wasting disease. Per data provided by the National Human Genome Research Institute, DMD is a devastating and debilitating disease affecting up to one in 3,500-5,000 male births globally. Thus, there is a significant unmet need for DMD treatments.At present, two approved therapies for the disease in the U.S. market are Serepta Therapeutics’ (SRPT  -  Free Report) Exondys 51 (eteplirsen) and Marathon Pharmaceuticals’ Emflaza (deflazacort), the first therapy approved for DMD in the country.Importantly, Pfizer is not the only company working on developing treatments for DMD. Other companies also involved in developing DMD therapies include Catabasis, Summit, PTC Therapeutics, BioMarin (BMRN  -  Free Report) et al.Pfizer Inc. Price Pfizer Inc. Price | Pfizer Inc.

1973,PFE,"We expect Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before market open.Bristol-Myers’ shares have decreased 16.5% so far this year compared with the industry’s decline of 4.7%.Bristol-Myers’ track record has been mixed so far. The company delivered positive earnings surprise in three of the last four quarters and missed expectations once. The average positive earnings surprise in the last four quarters is 4.23%. In the last reported quarter, Bristol-Myers delivered a positive surprise of 1.49%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter. What Will Drive Growth in Q1?Bristol-Myers’ blockbuster immuno-oncology drug, Opdivo is expected to remain the main sales driver in the first quarter, following several line extensions in 2017. In the soon-to-be reported quarter, the company announced encouraging results from a phase III study evaluating Opdivo in first-line non-small cell lung cancer. Opdivo in combination with Yervoy significantly improved progression free survival in patients compared to chemotherapy. A potential approval in this indication will be a significant boost for the drug, given the immense scope in the lung cancer market. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the drug’s sales in the first quarter is pegged at $1.38 billion.In January 2018, the European Commission approved the label expansion of Yervoy injection in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The FDA approved the drug for this indication in July 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the drug’s sales in this quarter is $291 million.In November 2017, the FDA approved line extension of Sprycel in pediatric patients with Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase. The drug, which registered growth of 6.7% in the previous quarter, is expected to receive a boost this quarter due to the expanded label. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Sprycel sales stands at $507 million. Cardiovascular drug, Eliquis, came up with a strong performance in 2017, with sales growing 44% year over year. Sales are expected to remain robust in the first quarter too. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Eliquis sales is pegged at $1.43 billion.On the other hand, the decline in Hepatitis C franchise is expected to continue due to intense competition from multiple drugs including Epclusa as its label was expanded to include HIV co-infection in August. Moreover, the HIV business continues to face competitive pressure. Recent launches by other companies in the same space are expected to further impact the Sustiva franchise. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hepatitis C franchise sales is pegged at $52 million this quarter, down 67.9% from the year-ago quarter actual figure.ConclusionSeveral label expansions of Bristol-Myers’ blockbuster cancer drug, Opdivo, drove the company’s sales last year and are expected do so this year as well. Moreover, cardiovascular drug, Eliquis, also demonstrated strong performance in 2017. We expect this trend to continue this quarter. Label expansion of leukemia drug, Sprycel, approved in November 2017, should bring in more sales for the drug. Moreover, continued strong performance of Yervoy and Orencia will have a favorable impact.However, genericization of Plavix, Avapro/Avalide and Baraclude in the United States due to loss of exclusivity is significantly hurting the company’s top line. The company also faces stiff competition in the immuno-oncology space. The HIV business continues to face competitive pressure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales and earnings for Q1 is pegged at $5.17 billion and 84 cents, respectively.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that Bristol-Myers is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP:Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +0.82%. This is a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank:Bristol-Myers has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price and EPS Surprise  Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price and EPS Surprise | Bristol-Myers Squibb Company QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderHere are some biotech stocks that you may also want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Pfizer Inc.

1974,PFE,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that it has formed an alliance with private biotech, Allogene Therapeutics, to expedite the development of its allogeneic CAR-T therapy.San Francisco-based Allogene is co-founded and led by former executives of Kite Pharma, which was acquired by Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) for $12 billion last year. Pfizer will own a 25% stake in Allogene and also get a representation on the latter’s board.Per the deal, Allogene will assume from Pfizer the rights to 16 preclinical CAR-T assets, which Pfizer in-licensed from French companies, Cellectis and Servier. In addition, Allogene will also gain rights to a phase I candidate, UCART19, which Pfizer developed in partnership with Servier. UCART19 is an allogeneic CAR-T therapy that has the potential to be developed for the treatment of CD19-expressing hematological malignancies. It is presently in a phase I study for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) while phase II studies are expected to be initiated next year by Allogene and Servier.Allogeneic CAR-T therapies, a potentially revolutionary cancer treatment approach, are developed from cells of healthy donors and stored for “off-the-shelf” use in patients. This approach eliminates the need to create personalized therapy, thereby reducing the time patients must wait for treatment.Focus on the CAR-T area has increased with last year’s FDA approval of therapies such as Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah and Gilead’s Yescarta. These treatments have huge commercial potential and could well change the treatment paradigm.CAR-T falls under the ambit of cellular immunotherapy, which involves using a patient’s own immune cells to attack and get rid of harmful disease cells in the body. The CAR-T approach involves the collection of a patient’s T cells, their genetic modification outside the body, the incorporation of specific receptors targeting cancer cells and finally, the re-infusion of the modified T cells back into the patient.It goes without saying that many drug/biotech companies are looking to boost their pipeline with such drugs.Meanwhile, per a CNBC report, Pfizer is in talks with consumer giant Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) regarding the sale of its Consumer Healthcare segmentLast October, Pfizer had said that it was exploring strategic alternatives for its Consumer Healthcare segment including a partial or a full separation through a spin-off, sale or other transaction. A decision regarding the same is expected to be made this year and it may ultimately opt to retain the business.However, Pfizer is having trouble finding a buyer for the same. Last month, London-based pharma/consumer giant Glaxo, which was considered a frontrunner to bid for Pfizer’s unit, withdrew from the race to buy Pfizer’s Consumer Healthcare segment. (Read more: Glaxo Drops Bid for Pfizer Unit, Shingrix Gains EU/Japan Nod).British company, Reckitt Benckiser Group also pulled out of the discussion with Pfizer to buy the same unit.Following the recent developments, Pfizer’s shares were up 1.8% on Tuesday.

1975,PFE,"Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (ALNY  -  Free Report) shares fell 8.3% after pharma giant Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced positive top-line results from a late-stage study on a competing rare disease candidate.Pfizer announced that a phase III ATTR-ACT study evaluating pipeline candidate tafamidis for a transthyretin cardiomyopathy, which is tied to progressive heart failure, met the primary endpoint. The condition belongs to a family of diseases called transthyretin amyloidosis, or ATTR.Top-line data from the ATTR-ACT study showed that treatment with tafamidis led to a statistically significant reduction in the combination of all-cause mortality and frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations — the primary endpoint — compared with the placebo at 30 months. The safety data also demonstrated that that tafamidis was generally well tolerated by patients.Currently, there are no approved medications in the United States for the treatment of transthyretin cardiomyopathy.Shares of Alnylam plunged on this news as it increases competitive pressure on Alnylam’s lead candidate patisiran which has been developed for hereditary TTR amyloidosis, or hATTR. Patisiran is under review in the EU and United States (PDUFA date of Aug 11, 2018) and might be launched this year.There are two types of TTR-CM, a hereditary form and a wild-type form of the disease, which is not hereditary. The ATTR-ACT study included both types of patients. However, Alnylam has developed patisiran for the hereditary form of the disease.Note that shares of Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (IONS  -  Free Report) also fell on the announcement of the positive data by Pfizer, as the Ionis’ candidate inotersenis also under review for hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

1976,PFE,"Shire plc’s (SHPG  -  Free Report) shares have been rallying since Japan-based Takeda Pharmaceutical announced its takeover intentions. Shire’s stock has gained almost 16% since closing on Mar 27.In the press release issued by Takeda, it has confirmed that it is considering a possible offer to buy out Shire to boost its core therapeutic areas. The acquisition will also help Takeda to have greater presence in the United States. However, there is no certainty that Takeda will make an offer, which needs to be confirmed by no later than Apr 25, 2018.Shire’s shares have lost 3.7% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s decline of 0.7% in that period.Investors are speculating a bidding war following Takeda’s announcement. Previously, several companies have been rumored to acquire Shire including Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report).Shire has a strong hold in the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) market, a major revenue generator for the company. The company has three drugs in its ADHD portfolio. However, the company faces competition as a result of the presence of generics of Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Concerta, Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Ritalin LA, and Adderall XR. Moreover, sales of Shire’s ulcerative colitis drug, Lialda, are also falling due to generic competition.Meanwhile, Shire is also looking for strategic alternatives for its neuroscience franchise, which includes the ADHD portfolio of drugs.Hence, Shire may consider the offer, as and when made by Takeda. It will likely create a company with sales to the tune of $30 billion.However, many analysts are skeptical about the impact of the deal on Takeda’s finances as both the companies have similar market cap. Also, there remains a concern about the benefit of adding Shire’s haemophilia portfolio to Takeda’s product line.Investors are likely to remain focused on any further announcements made by Takeda.Shire plc Price  Shire plc Price | Shire plc QuoteZacks RankShire currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1977,PFE,"Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (SRPT  -  Free Report) shares soared 37% on Tuesday after it announced promising results from an early-stage study, evaluating its gene therapy as a treatment for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)The preliminary data from the first three patients dosed in the phase I/IIa study showed that treatment with the gene therapy, AAVrh74.MHCK7.micro-dystrophin led to a significant increase in dystrophin protein production.Micro-dystrophin is a muscle protein, which is needed for muscles to function properly. The absence of this protein causes DMD, a rare muscular degenerative disease that mostly affects boys and can be fatal before patients turn 30. Any DMD therapy aims to boost the amount of micro-dystrophin in patients' muscles. Biopsies performed on day 90 showed robust levels of micro-dystrophin in patients treated with the gene therapy achieving a mean level of 38.2% compared to normal levels.A dramatic reduction in levels of serum creatine kinase (CK), an enzyme associated with muscle damage caused by DMD, was also observed after using the gene therapy. The data showed that treatment with the gene therapy led to a mean reduction of CK of over 87% by day 60. Meanwhile, no serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed in the study.The data were presented by Jerry Mendell, M.D. of Nationwide Children’s Hospital on Sarepta’s R&D Day.Dr. Mendell and Sarepta are hopeful that if this transformative data is sustained in additional patients and studies, it can produce a therapy that can dramatically change the course of the DMD disease.So far this year, Sarepta’s shares have rallied 89.1% against a 7.2% decrease registered by the industry. However, following the announcement, shares of PTC Therapeutics, Inc. (PTCT  -  Free Report), which also markets therapies to treat DMD, tumbled nearly 31%. Ironically, shares of PTC Therapeutics had risen almost 28% on Monday after it presented encouraging preliminary data from an early-stage study evaluating its pipeline candidate, risdiplam in babies with type 1 spinal muscular atrophy (“SMA”).Meanwhile, Solid Biosciences, Inc.

1978,PFE,"April has time and again proved to be favorable for stocks. But this time around, April has arrived during midterm election, which usually spells a rough phase for stocks.Earnings related volatility could spike further in April. Unabated trade tensions, possibilities of two or more rate hikes by the Fed this year, high profile departures in the Trump administration and the real impact of the tax overhaul policy are laying the base for a tumultuous earnings season. Long-dormant volatility, by the way, made a comeback last month.With the month expected to be rough, investing in sound dividend paying stocks seems judicious. Such stocks provide steady income and cushion one’s portfolio against market risks.Midterm Election Years Spell TroubleThe Stock Trader’s Almanac noted that April has traditionally been a strong month for stocks, going back to World War II. The Dow Jones, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite gained an average of 1.9%, 1.5% and 1.4%, respectively.But, such a rise wouldn’t be enough to drive the indices back to record territory. The Dow is already 9.4% below its all-time record high, the S&P 500 is off 8.1% and the Nasdaq is down 7.5%. Lest we forget, all the major bourses have already seen the second straight monthly drop and the second steepest monthly fall for the tech-laden Nasdaq since January 2016.A bigger concern, in fact, is that April comes during a mid-term election year. In such years, historically, the second quarter is weak for the broader market, as is the third quarter. In the second quarter, the market typically gains 1.8% since World War II but loses 2.2% during such years. The third quarter also isn’t much better than the second in election years.Volatility Likely to Stay Another concern for market pundits is earnings related volatility. Markets are gearing up for first-quarter earnings results this month. Investors seek clarity on the impact of protectionist trade policies and higher interest rates. After all, these factors will play a pivotal role in determining first-quarter earnings results.According to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc (GS  -  Free Report), “the options market is pricing in earnings volatility mostly in April week 4.” The technology sector, in particular, will be more susceptible to erratic movements. Goldman noted that almost 33% of April preannouncements are done by tech companies. Techs have already taken a beating following the backlash over Facebook, Inc’s (FB  -  Free Report) handling of user data (read more: Facebook Is a Screaming Buy Despite Data Scandal).Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is already up 81% in the first quarter, its biggest quarterly gain since 2011, according to the WSJ Market Data Group. The index last traded at 22.68, above its long-term average of 20. The VIX reflects traders’ collective anticipation for volatility in the upcoming 30-day period.Factors Intensifying InstabilityTrade-related fears increased after Trump imposed duties on foreign aluminum and steel, and levied tariffs on China products. Beijing retaliated by targeting 128 U.S. products with an import value of $3 billion. A full-blown trade should unnerve investors as it might deal a heavy blow to economies and hurt corporate profits.Amid all these, the Fed has hiked rates by a quarter-percentage point and projected a steeper path of rate hikes in 2019 and 2020. This hasn’t gone down well with investors as we all know that they had piled up on U.S. stocks with the notion that quantitative easing will help the domestic economy grow at a better rate than emerging economies. After all, rate hikes will raise borrowing costs, eventually denting corporate profits and affecting the U.S. economy.April Could be Cruel: Buy 5 Top Dividend Stocks NowWith so many concerns plaguing investors’ minds, dividend paying stocks are tempting options at the moment.

1979,PFE,"Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) has agreed to acquire a phase IIb ready candidate, PF-04958242, which is being developed for cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS) from pharma giant Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report).For the deal, Biogen will make an upfront payment of $75 million to Pfizer along with which the latter will also be entitled to up to $515 million in development/commercialization milestone payments and potential royalties.In the latter half of the year, Biogen will initiate a phase IIb study on PF-04958242 to determine if the AMPA receptor potentiator is safe and effective in the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia patients.Schizophrenia patients often experience significant deficits in cognitive function – the ability to make sense. The majority of more than 20 million people living with schizophrenia worldwide witness some degree of cognitive dysfunction, according to Biogen’s press release. However, this negative symptom of schizophrenia has been particularly difficult to treat.Biogen’s shares have declined 12.1% this year so far, underperforming the industry’s rise of 3.1% in the same time frame.The deal, which marks Biogen’s entry into the emerging market for neuropsychiatry, is in sync with its strategy to diversify its pipeline beyond its core therapeutic area - multiple sclerosis - to neurodegenerative disorders. Last year, Biogen added seven new clinical stage programs to its neuroscience pipeline through advancing internal pipeline candidates as well as through external deals.Biogen’s Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pipeline comprises candidates with different mechanisms of action including anti-tau candidate (BIIB092 - with potential in AD as well as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)), anti-amyloid (aducanumab) candidates as well as a BACE inhibitor (elenbecestat) program.Meanwhile, Biogen’s spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) treatment, Spinraza (nusinersen), approved in late 2016, has consolidated its position in the neurological disease market with the drug being the first and only treatment to be approvedin the United States for SMA. The market potential of the disease is huge. The drug has performed beyond expectations so far, witnessing strong patient uptake in the United States and internationally.In December last year, Biogen formed a new collaboration with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (IONS  -  Free Report) to identify antisense oligonucleotide drug candidates for the treatment of SMA. Biogen will have the option to license therapies arising out of this collaboration. Also, Biogen plans to start phase I study on a gene therapy asset for SMA by mid-2018.Biogen is also building a portfolio of best-in-class treatments for stroke and acute neurology. In Maylast year, Biogen purchased a phase III candidate, BIIB093/Cirara from Remedy Pharmaceuticals, which is being studied for the treatment of large hemispheric stroke (LHI), a severe form of stroke with no available therapy.Biogen carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the biotech sector is Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (LGND  -  Free Report) which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank  stocks here.Ligand’s earnings per share estimates have moved up by 9.8% for 2018 and 21% for 2019 in the last 30 days.

1980,PFE,"Merck KGaA  announced that the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) has granted SAKIGAKE 'fast-track' designation to its pipeline candidate, tepotinib. The company is developing the candidate for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”).The SAKIGAKE designation is granted to expedite a candidate’s development and review in Japan and focuses on new or unmet areas and regenerative medicines.Merck KGaA’s shares have underperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has lost 14.8% compared with the industry’s decline of 4.6% in that period.The designation was granted to tepotinib based on data from a phase II study evaluating it in NSCLC patients with MET exon 14 skipping mutations. There is no approved treatment for this indication.Data from the study will be presented at a future medical congress.Apart from tepotinib, Merck KGaA‘s oncology pipeline includes M7824, which is a bifunctional immunotherapy as it simultaneously blocks 2 immuno-inhibitory pathways that are commonly used by cancer cells. The company is evaluating the candidate in several tumors. However, the most advanced candidate in oncology pipeline, avelumab, is being developed in collaboration with Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) in several indications, including lung, gastric, ovarian and kidney cancer.Per the press release, lung cancer is the most common cancer globally. NSCLC occurs in 80% to 85% of lung cancer patients. However, tepotinib targets only 2% to 3% of NSCLC patients, who have MET exon 14 skipping mutations.However, several big pharma companies are already marketing their drugs to treat NSCLC. These include Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda; Pfizer’s Xalkori and Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, Opdivo.Merck KGaA Price  Merck KGaA Price | Merck KGaA QuoteWill You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1981,PFE,"Agenus Inc. (AGEN  -  Free Report) is expected to report first-quarter 2018 on May 3.In the last reported quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 25%. In the last four quarters the company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 7.44%.Notably, Agenus’ shares have outperformed the industry over a year. The stock has rallied 10.4%, as against the industry’s fall of 8.9%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Factors at PlayAgenus’ collaboration agreements with several companies, not only help it to procure funds in the form of upfront and milestone payments and future royalties but also validate its proprietary product platform. Agenus has collaborated with Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Incyte to discover and develop multiple checkpoint antibodies. Under the Incyte collaboration, Agenus is evaluating the latter’s anti-GITR checkpoint antibody — INCAGN1876 — in a phase I/II study, its anti-OX40 agonist antibody — INCAGN1949 — in a phase I/II study and its anti-CTLA-4 antibody — AGEN1884 — in a phase II study. All three candidates are being evaluated for the treatment of solid tumors. In January 2018, the company announced the launch of its combination phase I/II study with AGEN1884 and anti-PD1 (AGEN2034) antibodies. Agenus has no approved product in its portfolio. With only a few candidates in mid-stages of development, including Prophage Series vaccine, the company is still a few years away from bringing a product to market. Any hiccup in the development process of these candidates may weigh on the stock.In October 2017, Agenus established a separate business entity to advance its cell therapy program which is designed to be self-funded. The cell therapy company, AgenTus, will focus on the discovery, development, and commercialization of breakthrough “living drugs” to advance cures for cancer patients. The company took this decision to form smaller teams that can entirely focus on getting the products approved. The company expects the combined value of the separate companies to exceed the perceived value under one roof.In the first quarter the company will focus on its pipeline candidates and provide updates on them.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model does not show an earnings beat for Agenus this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Agenus has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 28 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Agenus has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which decreases the predictive power of ESP. Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into an earnings announcement. Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some biotech stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Pfizer Inc.

1982,PFE,"Per the latest Earnings Preview, the Q1 earnings season which has already crossed the half way mark is gaining strength with earnings and revenue growth on track to reach its highest level in seven years.Total earnings for the 267 S&P 500 members that have already reported results are up 25.1% from the same period last year on 10% higher revenues, with 76.8% beating top-line estimates and 73.8% beating revenue estimates. The proportion of companies beating both earnings and revenue estimates is 61.4%.The ongoing earnings season seems to have started off on a solid note for the Drug/Biotech sector. Among the major large cap players that have reported results, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) and AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings as well as sales.Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) also surpassed both earnings and revenue expectations this quarter.Higher demand is expected to boost new product sales. Also, innovation and successful product line expansion along with positive clinical study results, FDA approvals, and consistent performance of key products, growing demand for drugs, especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an ageing population as well as an increased healthcare expenditure are some of the factors that are expected keep the sector on a growth trajectory.Also, according to the Earnings Preview, the broader Medical sector (inclusive of drug, biotech as well as Medical Device companies) is likely to record 7% year-over-year growth in revenues and witness a 12.9% rise in earnings in the quarter under review.Four pharma/biotech giants are scheduled to report Q1 earnings results on May 1.

The company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10.71% in the last reported quarter. The company’s performance has been impressive in the recent past with its earnings surpassing expectations in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 4.97%.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.  The combination of the company’s Zacks Rank #2 and +1.36 Earnings ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s earnings for the quarter under review is pegged at 74 cents per share.In the Innovative Health segment, new products like Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis) and Ibrance (breast cancer) as well as older products like Lyrica (neuropathic pain), Chantix (smoking cessation) and Eliquis (blood thinner) are expected to drive the top line. In the Essential Health, biosimilars and emerging markets are expected to support sales.

The combination of Gilead’s Zacks Rank of 2 and an Earnings ESP of +0.32% makes us confident about an earnings beat in the upcoming report. The consensus mark for the quarter to be reported is pegged at $1.66 per share.The company’s Strong HIV performance and other antiviral product sales are being driven by continued uptake of tenofovir alafenamide (“TAF”) based products — Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey. We expect the trend to continue in the first quarter as well. The franchise received a further boost with the FDA approval of once-daily single tablet regimen (“STR”), Biktarvy (bictegravir 50mg/emtricitabine 200mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25mg, BIC/FTC/TAF) for HIV-1 infection in February 2018.

The consensus mark for the quarter to be reported is pegged at 8 cents per share.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Incyte continues to gain traction by its lead drug Jakafi’s performance.  Incyte's Jakafi performance was strong in 2017 driven by patient demand. The sales guidance for 2018 was also impressive. In October 2017, the FDA approved a label update of the drug to include the addition of new patient-reported outcome data from the COMFORT-I study, as well as updating the warning related to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. The pivotal REACH1 trial evaluating Jakafi in patients with steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease has completed enrollment and results are expected in the first half of 2018.Assuming successful results, Incyte expects to submit an sNDA seeking approval of Jakafi for this indication.

1984,PFE,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Pfizer is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for PFE in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 75 cents per share for PFE, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 74 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for PFE, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.36% heading into earnings season.Pfizer Inc.

1985,PFE,"Immune Design Corp. (IMDZ  -  Free Report) isscheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results after the market closes on May 2.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 25.64%. Immune Design topped earnings estimates in all of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat 19.84%.Immune Design’s shares have lost 10.2% year to date, compared with the industry’s fall of 3.7%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayBeing a development-stage biopharmaceutical company, Immune Design has not generated any product revenues yet. It earns revenues from collaboration and licensing agreements, and product sales.Investors remain focused on the company’s progress based on its pipeline candidates. Immune Design is developing multiple candidates using two discovery platforms — ZVex and GLAAS — for the treatment of various types of cancers. The company’s key pipeline candidates are CMB305 for solid tumor and G100 for merkel cell carcinoma (“MCC”).CMB305 has been designed under a prime-boost approach, involving the sequential dosing of two complementary agents — LV305 and G305.Currently, this candidate is being evaluated in soft tissue sarcoma patients both as monotherapy (phase I) and in combination with Roche Holding’s (RHHBY) Tecentriq (phase II). The company plans to initiate a pivotal phase III trial studying CMB305 as monotherapy in synovial sarcoma patients in mid-2018. If the progression free survival endpoint is met, the company intends to file a Biologics License Application and seek approval for CMB305 for the treatment of synovial sarcoma.The discussion with the FDA was positive regarding CMB305. Consequently, the company had planned to initiate a pivotal phase III trial studying CMB305 as monotherapy in synovial sarcoma patients. The study is expected to start in mid-2018. It will enroll 248 patients aged 12 and older with NY-ESO-1+ synovial sarcoma who will either receive CMB305 monotherapy or placebo. If the progression free survival endpoint is met, the company intends to file a Biologics License Application and seek approval for CMB305 for the treatment of synovial sarcoma. Meanwhile, G100 is being evaluated in multiple clinical trials, including as a monotherapy with local radiation in a completed phase I study in patients with MCC and in an ongoing investigator-sponsored trial in patients with sarcoma.It is also being developed as a monotherapy and combination therapy in patients with follicular non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (“NHL”), in a randomized phase Ib/II study. In October 2017, G100 received Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of follicular NHL from the European Medicines Agency.A potential approval of these pipeline candidates will be a boost for the company.During the earnings call, we expect Immune Design to shed light on the progress of these ongoing trials.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model does not show an earnings beat for Immune Design this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to be able to beat estimates. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Immune Design has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 29 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Immune Design has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. Immune Design Corp.

1986,PFE,"Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) fell 7.8% as investors were not much impressed with the company’s initial results from the phase III study, CheckMate -227. The study was evaluating the Opdivo 3 mg/kg plus low-dose Yervoy (1 mg/kg) combination in first-line advanced non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) patients with high tumor mutational burden (TMB) ≥10 mutations/megabase (mut/Mb).The combination demonstrated a superior benefit for the co-primary endpoint of progression-free survival (“PFS”) versus chemotherapy. The initial results showed that the one-year PFS rate was more than triple with the combination versus chemotherapy (43% vs. 13%).The overall response rate with the combination was 45.3% while that of 26.9% the chemotherapy arm. 68% of responders had ongoing responses at one year (25% with chemotherapy). Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse event rate with the Opdivo plus low-dose Yervoy combination was 31% versus 36% with chemotherapy.While the results were encouraging, investors were disappointed as Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda seem to have fared better than Opdivo and Yervoy combination.  Merck announced results from a phase III study, KEYNOTE-189, evaluating anti-PD-1 therapy Keytruda, in combination with pemetrexed (Alimta) and cisplatin or carboplatin for the first-line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC. The results showed that the Keytruda-pemetrexed-platinum chemotherapy combination significantly improved overall survival (“OS”), reducing the risk of death by half compared with chemotherapy alone.Consequently, shares of Bristol-Myers declined. The first-line NSCLC market competition is stiffening with quite a few companies trying to capture additional market share.     Shares of the company have gained only 4.8% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s growth of 10.7%. Concurrently, Bristol-Myers announced that it obtained FDA approval for Opdivo plus Yervoy (injections for intravenous use) as the first immuno-oncology combination therapy for previously untreated patients with intermediate- and poor-risk advanced renal cell carcinoma. The phase III trial, CheckMate-214 demonstrated a significant and unprecedented increase in OS for the abovementioned combination in this patient population compared to a current standard of care, Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Sutent.Moreover, Opdivo demonstrated sustained OS advantage over standard of care in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the Head and Neck in CheckMate-141. Patients treated with Opdivo experienced a 32% reduction in the risk of death after two years minimum follow-up.We note that Opdivo is currently approved in several countries including the United States, the EU and Japan for several cancer indications. Opdivo continues to be launched globally on approvals and label expansions. The drug has been performing impressively due to demand resulting from the rapid commercial acceptance for several indications including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and second-line NSCLC. Label expansion into additional indications would give the product access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug significantly.Bristol-Myers announced a worldwide collaboration with Johnson & Johnson’s  (JNJ  -  Free Report) Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen) on a Factor XIa (FXIa) inhibitor program that includes the development and commercialization of the former’s factor XIa (FXIa) inhibitor, BMS-986177.We note that BMS-986177, an investigational anticoagulant compound is being evaluated for prevention and treatment of major thrombotic conditions. Both companies are expected to advance BMS-986177 into phase II trials in the second half of 2018 for the study of secondary stroke prevention.Zacks RankBristol-Myers carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1987,PFE,"GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) has entered into an agreement with Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) to buy out the latter’s stake in their Consumer Healthcare joint venture (JV) for $13 billion (£9.2 billion).With the acquisition of Novartis’ 36.5% stake, Glaxo will now have 100% ownership of its Consumer Healthcare unit, which includes products such as Sensodyne and Flonase.Glaxo is optimistic that the deal will be accretive to adjusted earnings in 2018 and thereafter improve the company’s cash flow.Shares of the British drug maker were up around 2.6% on Tuesday in response to this positive news. Glaxo’s stock has risen 10.1% this year so far, against a decline of 3.4% for the industry.Glaxo and Novartis created the JV in 2015 as part of a three-part transaction between the two companies by combining their consumer divisions. Glaxo owned 63.5% share of the JV.As part of the same asset-swap, Novartis also acquired Glaxo’s oncology products for $14.5 billion and up to $1.5 billion in milestone payments. In exchange, Glaxo acquired Novartis’ Vaccines business (excluding influenza vaccines) for $7.1 billion ($5.25 billion upfront and up to $1.8 billion in milestone payments) along with royalties.In the 2015 deal, there was a clause, which gave Novartis the right – exercisable from Mar 2, 2018 to Mar 2, 2035 – to ask Glaxo to purchase its stake. With the latest deal between the companies, this overhang has been removed.The transaction, expected to be completed in the second quarter, is subject to approval of Glaxo’s shareholders.Also, Glaxo said it is looking at strategic alternatives for its Horlicks and other nutrition products to help fund the deal. These nutrition products are mostly sold by Glaxo’s Indian subsidiary, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare. Glaxo owns 72.5% stake in the Indian subsidiary, which it said will also be included in the strategic review process. Food giants, Nestle, The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and Unilever are being speculated as the frontrunners to bid for the Horlicks business.Glaxo’s latest deal with Novartis comes in less than a week after it announced that it is withdrawing from the race to buy Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Consumer Healthcare segment. (Read more: Glaxo Drops Bid for Pfizer Unit, Shingrix Gains EU/Japan Nod)Pfizer is exploring strategic alternatives for its Consumer Healthcare segment including a partial or a full separation through a spin-off, sale or other transaction.At that time, Glaxo’s chief executive officer, Emma Walmsley said that management is interested in deals that will improve the company’s returns and not “compromise on its priorities for capital allocation.”Conversely, Emma Walmsley justified the new agreement to buy out Novartis’ stake by saying that it “addresses one of its key capital allocation priorities.”Glaxo expects its Consumer Healthcare business to deliver sales and earnings growth and also approach operating margins in the mid-20’s percentage range by 2022. We believe the Novartis deal is more prudent than buying Pfizer’s Consumer unit, which would have reportedly cost Glaxo around $20 billion.For Novartis, the sale price of this non-core business reflects an “attractive value”. Novartis said it expects to use the proceeds from the sale for driving shareholder returns, invest in core products and also for bolt-on acquisitions.Glaxo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1988,PFE,"The gene therapy space has once again hogged the limelight following the Swiss pharma giant Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) announcement of the acquisition of AveXis, Inc. .Per the agreement, Novartis will pay $8.7 billion for the buyout of this clinical stage gene therapy company. AveXis lead product candidate, AVXS-101, is being evaluated as one-time gene replacement therapy for spinal muscular atrophy, a disease which results in early death or life-long disability with considerable healthcare costs. The acquisition will poise Novartis in the promising gene therapy space. The acquisition will be completed in mid-2018.Post the announcement, share price of major players in this space moved up. Shares of AveXis have skyrocketed 200.2% in the last 12 months.Novartis is trying to develop a gene therapy portfolio. In January 2018, Novartis signed a license and commercialization agreement for the development and commercialization of investigational voretigene neparvovec outside the United States with Spark Therapeutics. Novartis obtained FDA approval for the first CAR-T therapy, Kymriah, in 2017.Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) recently initiated a phase Ib clinical trial for its mini-dystrophin gene therapy candidate, PF-06939926, in boys with duchenne muscular dystrophy.What is Gene Therapy?Gene therapy helps to mitigate the adverse effects of a malfunctioning disease-causing gene. The therapy intends to add a functional gene back in a person's system replacing the malfunctioning one to cure diseases. The therapy has a different approach from the traditional drug ones wherein the underlying cause is getting treated unlike symptoms.Gene therapy is set to become one of the most promising space in the volatile biotech sector which continues to grapple with increasing threat from biosimilars. Notably, the Medical - Biomed/Genetics sub-industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 173, which places it at the bottom 35% of the 265 plus Zacks industries. Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Stocks in FocusGiven the potential the market holds, a number of companies have started to develop the therapy with several of them having promising candidates in their pipelines.Spark Therapeutics (ONCE  -  Free Report) is one of the prominent players in the gene therapy space. The company obtained FDA approval for its lead gene therapy drug, Luxturna (voretigene neparvovec-rzyl), for the treatment of patients with viable retinal cells and confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy.Luxturna is the first FDA-approved gene therapy for inherited retinal disease and the first adeno-associated virus (AAV) as well as for vector gene therapy approved in the United States. The company has built a pipeline of gene therapy product candidates that are directed to the retina, the liver and the central nervous system. The pipeline includes an ocular program consisting of SPK-7001, targeting choroideremia currently in phase I/II. Its hemophilia programs consist of SPK-9001 for hemophilia B and SPK-8011 for hemophilia A, both currently in phase I/II clinical trials.The company’s shares have rallied 49.1% in the last three months, as against the industry’s decline of 9.0%.

(QURE  -  Free Report) is another promising player in this space which is creating a pipeline of innovative gene therapies that have been developed both internally and through its collaboration, focused on cardiovascular diseases, with Bristol Myers-Squibb.The lead product candidate, AMT-061, is being evaluated for the treatment of patients with severe and moderately-severe hemophilia B.  The company also announced plans to advance AMT-061, which includes an AAV5 vector carrying the FIX-Padua transgene, into a pivotal study.   The company has already obtained orphan drug designation for AMT-130 for the treatment of Huntington’s disease in the United States and the European Union and holds global commercialization rights of the program.uniQure currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. uniQure’s stock has moved up 66.7% in the last three months as against the industry’s decline.  BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN  -  Free Report) dosed the first patient in the global GENEr8-1 phase III study with the 6e13 vg/kg dose for valoctocogene roxaparvovec, an experimental gene therapy for the treatment of patients with severe hemophilia A in December 2017.   The phase III program includes two studies with valoctocogene roxaparvovec, one with the 6e13 vg/kg dose (GENEr8-1) and one with the 4e13 vg/kg dose (GENEr8-2).Valoctocogene roxaparvovec had been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA.  The European Medicines Agency granted access to its Priority Medicines regulatory initiative for valoctocogene roxaparvovec.BioMarin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. BioMarin’s stock has lost 7.1% in the last three months underperforming the industry’s decline.  What’s Ahead?With gene therapy gaining traction, investors should keep an eye on this space as potential approvals and data read-outs from late stage trials of several companies are likely to keep them on a growth trajectory.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1989,PFE,"Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) has received FDA’s accelerated approval for label expansion of its blockbuster anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, to include advanced cervical cancer in second-line setting. The company will need to evaluate the drug in confirmatory studies in this indication for gaining continued approval.The eligible patients for the treatment in cervical cancer will be selected based on an FDA-approved test for PD-L1 expression in tumors with combined positive score (“CPS”) ≥1.The approval comes a bit earlier than the expected date of Jun 28. The FDA had granted priority review to this label expansion regulatory application in March.Keytruda is the most successful immuno-oncology drug to date with approval in several cancer indications including the lucrative first-line lung cancer. This is the first anti-PD-1 therapy approved in advanced cervical cancer and the first indication for Keytruda in gynecologic cancer as well.This year so far, Merck’s shares have outperformed the industry. Its shares have risen 10.9% in the period against the industry’s decline of 4.4%.  The latest FDA approval is based on data from a single cohort of a multi-cohort phase II study – KEYNOTE-158 – evaluating the drug in recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. Data from a subset of patient population expressing PD-L1 with a CPS ≥1 showed that Keytruda achieved an objective response rate of 14.3%. Moreover, 2.6% of the patients achieved a complete response and 11.7% of patients demonstrated partial response.The drug generated no response in cervical cancer patients whose PD-L1 expression in tumors had a CPS <1.Merck is evaluating the drug in a wide range of cancer indications and treatment settings in more than 750 clinical studies.At the recently concluded annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, this PD-L1 inhibitor stole the limelight with encouraging data from multiple clinical studies. The data presentation, which garnered attention from physicians and investors, was from a second interim analysis of a pivotal lung cancer study on Keytruda — phase III KEYNOTE-407 study.Moreover, Merck has collaborated with several pharma companies, including Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), Glaxo (GSK  -  Free Report), Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and Incyte, to evaluate Keytruda in combination with other regimens.The drug generated worldwide sales of almost $1.5 billion in the first quarter of 2018, up 150% from the year-ago period. With this line extension approval in cervical cancer and potential approvals in other indications under review, the positive momentum of the drug is expected to continue in 2018.Merck & Co., Inc.

1990,PFE,"Biogen Inc (BIIB  -  Free Report) announced that it has signed an option agreement with private biotech, TMS Co., Ltd. to acquire the latter’s phase II acute stroke candidate TMS-007 and backup compounds.Biogen is expected to pay $4 million upfront and an additional $18 million if it exercises the option with up to $335 million payable as potential milestone payments.TMS-007 designed to restore blood flow following acute stroke is being evaluated in a phase II study. In August 2015, the candidate completed the phase l study.With this acquisition, Biogen aims to boost its acute neurology portfolio, a strategic move for the company’s growth. To pursue innovative approaches in therapeutic area, Biogen already has a phase III ready pipeline candidate, BIIB093, under development for the prevention and treatment of edema in large hemispheric infarction, a severe type of stroke.However, in February 2018, Biogen’s multiple sclerosis (MS) drug, Tysabri (natalizumab), failed to meet the primary and secondary endpoints in a phase IIb program, evaluating it for another indication, acute ischemic stroke (AIS).Some investors believe that natalizumab’s failure in the AIS study could be a reason behind this buyout from TMS.Biogen’s core business area is multiple sclerosis (MS), a disabling disease of the brain and spinal cord. Key multiple sclerosis drugs in its portfolio are Tecfidera, Avonex and Tysabri. However, it is looking to diversify its business and aims at being a leader in neuroscience and adjacent therapeutic space.In 2017, Biogen added seven new clinical stage programs to its neuroscience pipeline through advancing internal pipeline candidates as well as via external deals.This year in March, Biogen agreed to acquire a phase IIb ready candidate, PF-04958242, for cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS) from Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report). In January, Biogen acquired the rights to Karyopharm’s phase I ready investigational oral compound, KPT-350, for certain neurological and neurodegenerative conditions, primarily focused on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS. Biogen plans to start a phase I trial by the end of 2018.Shares of Biogen have lost 4.2% year to date, outperforming the industry’s decline of 6.7%. Biogen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1991,PFE,"Gender diversity is en vogue with the number of female corporate leaders going up. More female employees are taking the top positions in a number of companies. After dropping to 21 in 2016, the number of women CEOs on Fortune 500 increased more than 50% to a record 32 at the start of 2017.However, the number declined to 27 as of Jan 2018 and will drop further down to 24 by April. Despite this, women hold 21% of board seats at S&P 500 companies per Catalyst, a group researching women and work.Several researches show that the companies led by women have constantly outperformed the market. According to the analysis by the bank Nordea, companies with a woman in the chief executive or chairman role have performed far better than a major global index over the past eight years. The annualized returns for female-led firms, based on an equal weighting, was 25% since 2009, compared with just 11% for the broader market — the MSCI World Index (read: Top-Ranked Sector ETFs & Stocks From Top Industries).Given the long history of outperformance, many investors are seeking to add female-centric companies to their portfolio although the list is still small. While betting on an individual company is certainly a good option, investors can also play this space with lower risk and higher diversification benefits in a basket form.Currently, there are a couple of products offering broad exposure to women-led companies. We have highlighted them in detail below.SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity Index ETF (SHE  -  Free Report)This ETF offers exposure to U.S. companies that demonstrate greater gender diversity within senior leadership than other firms in their sector by tracking the SSGA Gender Diversity Index. Holding 169 stocks, it is moderately concentrated on the top firms as each account for less than 5.7% of assets. Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) and Mastercard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) are top three holdings. From a sector look, information technology takes the largest share at 22.6%, followed by healthcare (16.9%), consumer staples (13.3%) and consumer discretionary (12.1%). The product has amassed $318.8 million in its asset base while trades in light volume of about 11,000 shares. It charges 20 bps in annual fees and has gained 10.3% over the past year (read: Tech ETFs & Stocks Surviving the Market Rout in February).Barclays Women in Leadership ETN (WIL  -  Free Report)This product is linked to the performance of the Barclays Women in Leadership Total Return USD Index, which provides exposure to U.S.-based companies that satisfy one or both of the gender diversity criteria of having a female chief executive officer or having at least 25% female members on the board of directors. The ETN has amassed $36.7 million in its asset base and trades in a paltry volume of around 200 shares. Expense ratio comes in at 0.45%. The note is up 7.2% over the past year (see: all the Large Cap ETFs here).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

1992,PFE,"AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) announced that the European Medicines Agency has accepted the Marketing Authorization Variation (MAV) for the label expansion of Forxiga (dapagliflozin).Forxiga, a selective SGLT-2 inhibitor, is presently marketed both as a monotherapy as well as a combination therapy to improve glycaemic controlin adult patients with type-2 diabetes (T2D).With the MAV, AstraZeneca is seeking to get Forxiga approved as an oral adjunct treatment to insulin in adults with type-1 diabetes (T1D). The submission to EMA was based on phase III data from the DEPICT study which showed that Forxiga, when given as an oral adjunct to adjustable insulin in patients with inadequately-controlled T1D, led to significant and clinically-relevant reductions from baseline in blood sugar levels (HbA1c), weight and total daily insulin dose at 24 and 52 weeks, compared to placebo, at both 5 mg and 10 mg doses.Over a year, AstraZeneca’s shares have rallied 14.4%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 8.8%.We remind investors that in December 2017, Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) investigational oral SGLT-2 inhibitor, Steglatro (ertugliflozin) tablets, and Steglujan (ertugliflozin + sitagliptin) were approved by the FDA as an adjunct to diet and exercise for improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.Apart from these two drugs, the FDA also approved Segluromet (ertugliflozin + metformin) for the same indication in patients already treated with Steglatro or Glucophage (metformin) with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and patients who are already treated with combination of ertugliflozin and metformin.Astrazeneca PLC Price Astrazeneca PLC Price | Astrazeneca PLC Quote Zacks Rank and Stock to ConsiderAstraZeneca carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

1993,PFE,"GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) announced data from a study, showing that patients whose asthma was uncontrolled with Xolair witnessed improved asthma control on switching to Glaxo’s new respiratory medicine, Nucala.The OSMO study evaluated if severe asthma patients, whose disease was uncontrolled despite taking Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report)/Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) asthma medicine Xolair for an average of 2.5 years, saw better asthma control following a switch to Nucala. Data presented from the study showed that following the Nucala switch, these eligible patients experienced fewer symptoms, better lung function, improved asthma-related quality of life and fewer exacerbations. The data, which contributes to the extensive body of evidence for Nucala, were presented by Glaxo at American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) and World Allergy Organization (WAO) Joint Congress in Orlando.Nucala, approved to treat severe eosinophilic asthma, is one of the key new products in Glaxo’s respiratory portfolio, which is driving the top line.In a separate press release, Glaxo and partner Pfizer, Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) HIV-focused company, ViiV Healthcare, announced 24-week, interim data from the phase IIIb INSPIRING study, evaluating the safety and efficacy of investigational candidate dolutegravir in antiretroviral treatment-naive (ART-naïve) adults with HIV, co-infected with tuberculosis (TB).  Data from the study showed that 81% of HIV/TB co-infected adults (on a rifampin-based TB treatment), who were administered dolutegravir (50mg twice-daily) in combination with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) therapies, maintained viral suppression. In the group of patients who received efavirenz (600mg once-daily) with two NRTIs, 89% maintained viral suppression. The data were presented at the annual conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) in Boston.According to the company’s press release, tuberculosis accounts for around one in three AIDS-related deaths. There are many complications related to concurrent treatment of TB and HIV. The INSPIRING data supports the use of dolutegravir in HIV/TB co-infected patients.Glaxo’s shares have risen 3.7% this year so far, outperforming the 1.7% decrease witnessed by the industry.Glaxo has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1994,PFE,"Merck KGaA  is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Mar 8.Merck’s shares have declined 12.8% in the past year against the industry’s gain of 0.2%. The company reports financial numbers under three business sectors — Healthcare, Life Science and Performance Materials.Merck’s revenues were driven by sales growth in its Healthcare and Life Science segments in the third quarter. We expect this positive trend to continue in the upcoming quarterly results. Meanwhile, the company is streamlining Healthcare business to focus on its pipeline of innovative medicines.During the first half of 2017, the company received an approval for Bavencio for treatment of metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) and advanced bladder cancer in the United States. Moreover, the drug was approved in the EU and Japan for treating mMCC in September 2017.During the period to be , Merck’s multiple sclerosis drug, Mavenclad, was approved in Australia and Canada following its approval in Europe in the third quarter.The company continues to develop Bavencio in partnership with Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) for several cancer indications. However, the drug failed in a phase III study, conducted to evaluate it for the treatment of gastric cancer in the third-line setting.Sales of three key drugs — Rebif, Erbitux and Gonal-f — are expected to be lower in fourth-quarter 2017 results. This downside is likely to be caused by persistent competitive pressure and price reduction. Moreover, unfavorable currency movement is anticipated to dent the top line.Additionally, operating expenses increased during the first nine months of 2017 due to product launches and higher pipeline development cost. Expenses are estimated to rise as the company focuses on developing an innovative pipeline, the launch of Bavencio in new geographies as well as Mavenclad.We expect management to shed light on progress and commercialization plans for Bavencio on the earnings call. The company is likely to provide updates on its strategic plans.Merck KGaA Price and EPS Surprise  Merck KGaA Price and EPS Surprise | Merck KGaA Quote Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a couple of healthcare stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to deliver an earnings beat.

1995,PFE,"President Trump wants to slap tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum to protect domestic producers. But it hasn’t gone down well with the investing community. The tariffs will increase the cost of companies that rely heavily on steel and aluminum, affecting their bottom lines. Further, these have raised anxieties that other countries will retaliate, increasing the odds of a trade war and harm to the global economy.  The tariff declaration incited a steep stock market selloff and a rebuke from world leaders. The Dow plunged for four straight trading sessions on Mar 2, while the industrials sector of the S&P 500 was hit the hardest. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge came in at 19.59, way higher than a reading near 11 for most of 2017.With the markets receiving a drubbing on Trump tariffs, investing in stocks that provide excellent risk-adjusted returns won’t be a bad proposition.Trump Tariffs to Hurt U.S. IndustrialsTrump surprised the global market by announcing steep tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. The President said that the United States will impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum.But, tariffs on steel and aluminum have stoked concerns among manufacturers of cars, planes and machinery that rely heavily on such products. After all, steel and aluminum are major expenses for these industries, so an uptick in cost will hurt their profits. Needless to say, the tariff announcement has propelled steel prices to a six-year high of $840 per ton, while aluminum prices exploded to a two-year high at 17 cents per pound.Higher prices on steel and aluminum, furthermore, will compel these companies that rely on such products to pass on some of the costs to consumers. Increased consumer prices may in the long run hamper sales growth and affect companies, leading to job losses. Trump’s tariffs are estimated to hurt nearly 6.5 million U.S. workers at steel and aluminum consuming manufacturers.Retaliation Heats UpThe affected companies further cautioned that they may face retaliatory tariffs from foreign players against the goods they export, eventually denting their profit margins. Trump’s tariff announcement has already evoked anger among global leaders, with the European Union saying that it will impose tariffs on $3.5 billion worth of U.S. imports, as per Reuters.China cautioned America to abide by multilateral trade rules and not to harm the delicate global economy. We shouldn’t forget that China is the world’s dominant steel producer and Trump’s tariff moves could easily start a trade war between them.Tariffs also raise threats of a trade war with America’s closest ally, Canada. After all, Canada is the top exporter of both steel and aluminum from the United States. Canada is solely responsible for manufacturing 17% of all the U.S. steel imports and 43% of all aluminum imports. Other major suppliers to the United States, including Brazil, South Korea, Mexico and Russia will also be negatively impacted.Tariffs news hit not only heavy users of steel and aluminum, but also cyclical-sensitive sectors like technology and consumer cyclicals to name a few. Investors remained worried that threats of retaliation by trade partners could harm global economic growth that was widely seen as the major driving force of the stock market’s rally last year.Dow Companies Strongly Disagree With Trump TariffsHere is how some of the blue-chip companies responded to Trump tariffs:The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) agreed with Can Manufacturers Institute (CMI) President Robert Budway, who said that tariff restrictions will have a severe impact on the can manufacturing industry, its employees and consumers of such aluminum cans. Tariffs will increase price, lead to supply inefficiency and affect product availability.Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) supported American Petroleum Institute (API) stance that they “support free trade” largely in the oil and natural gas industries, but in other industries as well.JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) shares its view with Joshua Bolten, chief executive of the Business Roundtable, who said that the industry group urges Trump to persuade “other approaches” to address issues related to overcapacity of steel and aluminum that won’t place the economy at high risk.Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) stood by Retail Industry Leaders Association that said “Trump administration’s intention to unilaterally impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports could have severely negative consequences for the American economy. If broadly applied, these tariffs will have a downstream impact on every sector.”The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) responded by saying that Trump’s tariff plan “is likely to escalate trade tensions, particularly as it looks likely to apply to a broad group of countries including to some allies of the U.S.”5 Ultra-Safe BetsGiven such heightened tariff concerns, investors should build a strategy around low-risk assets and a combination of parameters that lead to better returns.

1996,PFE,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) said it plans to invest $600 million in Pfizer Ventures, its venture capital arm. This funding will be invested in small biotechs and other emerging growth companies. About 25% — $150 million — of the newly available fund will be earmarked for companies involved in promising early-stage neuroscience research. Pfizer Ventures will first invest in companies focussed on neuro-degeneration, neuro-inflammation and neuro-metabolic disorders.Pfizer Ventures already has investments in six neuroscience companies including Aquinnah, Autifony, Cortexyme, MindImmune, MISSION, and Neuronetics. In 2015, Pfizer became part of the Dementia Discovery Fund (DDF), which was formed to speed up the development of new treatments for neurological diseases by bringing together major pharma companies, the U.K. government and Alzheimer’s Research UK. The fund is involved in the financing of new, early stage drug development projects. Since its launch in October 2015, DDF has raised more than $190 million, which has been invested in dementia drug discovery companies and projects. Other investors in DDF include Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report), Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and Glaxo (GSK  -  Free Report), among others.Other than neuroscience, the venture capital arm’s area of interest will include oncology, inflammation and immunology, rare disease, internal medicine and vaccines. Pfizer Ventures, which manages more than 40 companies currently, will have five new members.  Pfizer has already invested $500 million in the venture capital arm. With the latest funding, the total assets under management add up to more than $1 billion. This year so far, Pfizer’s shares have increased 0.4% against a decrease of 4.6% for the industry.Ironically, the news comes in less than six months after Pfizer said that it will drop its plans to develop treatments for neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. These are highly challenging areas with not much progress being made despite significant investments (funds as well as resources).Pfizer currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1997,PFE,"AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced that its investigational oral JAK inhibitor, upadacitinib met all primary as well as secondary endpoints in the fifth phase III study from its SELECT program.The phase III study, SELECT-EARLY, evaluated the candidate for moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients who had not been previously treated with chemotherapy agent methotrexate (MTX) versus MTX monotherapy. The SELECT program evaluates more than 4,000 patients across six studies on RA.After 12 weeks of treatment, the ACR50 response (primary endpoint) was achieved in 52% of the patients receiving the 15 mg oral once-daily dose of upadacitinib and 56% of the patients taking the 30 mg dose versus 28% for patients receiving MTX.The second primary endpoint of clinical remission was achieved by 48% of the patients in the 15 mg dose arm and 50% in the 30 mg dose arm, at week 24, versus only 18% for MTX.Meanwhile, 76% and 77% of patients in the 15 mg and 30 mg dose arm, respectively achieved ACR20 response at week 12 versus 54% for MTX.The results clearly show that a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with upadacitinib in both doses achieved superior responses compared to MTX. This suggests that upadacitinib monotherapy has the potential to control progression of RA and reduce the risk of permanent bone and joint damage for MTX naive patients.AbbVie plans to submit regulatory applications for upadacitinib in rheumatoid arthritis in the second half of the year.Other than rheumatoid arthritis, upadacitinib is also being evaluated in late-stage studies for Crohn’s disease and psoriatic arthritis and mid-stage studies for atopic dermatitis, giant cell arteritis and ulcerative colitis.JAK inhibitors, also known as Janus kinase inhibitors, are emerging as a potential treatment option for RA, eczema and other inflammatory diseases. These medicines work by inhibiting the activity of one or more of the Janus kinase family of enzymesLast week, Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and partner Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) gained FDA approval for the lower dose of (2 mg) of their oral JAK inhibitor, Olumiant. While the FDA did not approve the higher dose (4 mg), the drug’s label was approved with a boxed warning stating risk of serious infections, malignancies and thrombosis. Olumiant is already marketed in Europe and Japan. Another JAK inhibitor available in the market to treat RA is Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xeljanz.Successful development of upadacitinib will boost AbbVie’s RA portfolio, especially as biosimilar competition looms for its blockbuster RA drug, Humira.Humira accounts for 65% of AbbVie’s sales. Amgen and Samsung Bioepis/Biogen’s Humira biosimilars will be launched in the United States in 2023 and in the EU in 2018.AbbVie’s shares have gained 2.6% this year so far against the industry’s decline of 4.1%. AbbVie currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1998,PFE,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) kicked off 2018 pharma earnings on a strong note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts in the first quarter of 2018. The drug and consumer products giant upped its previously issued sales outlook for 2018. Shares were up around 1% in pre-market trading.This year so far, J&J’s shares have declined 5.7%, comparing unfavorably with the 2.7% decline witnessed by the industry.Earnings BeatJ&J’s first-quarter 2018 earnings came in at $2.06 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.01 and increasing 12.6% from the year-ago period.Adjusted earnings excluded amortization expense and some special items. Including these items, J&J reported first-quarter earnings of $1.60 per share compared with earnings of $1.61 in the year-ago period.Sales Beat SlightlySales came in at $20 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19.48 billion. Sales also increased 12.6% from the year-ago quarter, reflecting an operational increase of 8.4% and a positive currency impact of 4.2%. Organically, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, sales increased 4.3% on an operational basis, better than 2.4% increase seen in 2017. This is because the Pharmaceutical segment continued the positive momentum seen in the second half of 2017 and the Consumer segment sales improved.First-quarter sales grew 6.1% in the domestic market to $9.95 billion and 19.9% in international markets to $10 billion, reflecting 10.9% operational growth and 9% positive currency impact.Sales in DetailsPharmaceutical segment sales rose 19.4% year over year to $9.84 billion, reflecting 15.1% operational growth and 4.3% positive currency impact as sales rose in both domestic and international markets. Sales in the domestic market rose 9.9% to $5.35 billion while international sales grew 33.1% to $4.49 billion (operational increase of 22.5%).New products like Imbruvica (cancer) and Darzalex (multiple myeloma) continued to perform well. Core products like Xarelto, Stelara, Zytiga, Simponi/Simponi Aria and Invega Sustenna also contributed to growth. Please note that J&J markets Imbruvica in partnership with AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report).Organically, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, sales increased 7.5% on an operational basis, slightly less than 7.6% growth seen in the previous quarter.In the quarter, J&J recorded pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) revenues of $585 million, less than $610 million in the previous quarter. The $30 billion acquisition of Swiss biotech,Actelion in June last year diversified J&J’s revenues to the PAH category and added 7.6% to sales growth in the first quarter.However, sales of Invokana/Invokamet declined 12.7% due to higher managed care discounting. Importantly, sales of the blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug, Remicade, marketed in partnership with Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report), was down 16.9% in the quarter with U.S. sales declining 22.5%. However, international sales rose 1.8% despite biosimilar competition.J&J’s Pharma segment achieved some clinical milestones during the quarter including FDA approvals of prostate cancer drug, Erleada for the treatment of men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and line extension of already marketed prostate cancer drug, Zytiga in combination with prednisone in the first-line setting.Medical Devices segment sales came in at $6.77 billion, up 7.5% from the year-ago period. It included an operational increase of 3.2% and positive currency movement of 4.3%.Domestic market sales rose 2.2% year over year to $3.16 billion. International market sales increased 12.7% (operational increase of 4.2%) year over year to $3.61 billion.The Consumer segment recorded revenues of $3.4 billion in the reported quarter, up 5.3% year over year(operational increase of 1.3%). Foreign currency movement positively impacted sales in the segment by 4%. Sales in the domestic market rose 1.6% from the year-ago period to $1.44 billion.Meanwhile, the international segment recorded an increase of 8.2% to 1.96 billion, reflecting an operational increase of 1.2% and a positive currency impact of 7%.2018 Outlook J&J maintained the previously issued earnings guidance for 2018 while increasing the sales range.J&J still expects 2018 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $8.00 - $8.20, reflecting an operational growth rate between 6.8% and 9.6%.However, now it expects revenues in the range of $81.0 to $81.8 billion, higher than $80.6 billion to $81.4 billion, reflecting operational constant currency sales growth rate in the range of 4% to 5% (previously 3.5% to 4.5%).Our TakeThough quite a few key products in J&J’s portfolio like Remicade and Concerta face generic competition, we believe that new products like plaque psoriasis drug, Tremfya (guselkumab), cancer drugs, Darzalex, Imbruvica and Zytiga, currency tailwinds and contribution from acquisitions helped J&J deliver strong sales and profit in the first quarter of the year and led it to raise the sales outlook for the whole year. In fact, J&J is quite confident that its Pharma segment will continue to perform better than the market this year despite impact of biosimilars on Remicade sales, as told by chief financial officer, Dominic J. Caruso to Bloomberg.Meanwhile, J&J announced some global supply chain initiatives, which will annually save approximately $600 million to $800 million in pre-tax costs by 2022. Meanwhile, Alex Gorsky, chairman and chief executive officer of J&J said that the company will invest more than $30 billion in R&D and capital investments in the United States over the next four years. The new tax laws will leave some extra cash in the hands of large pharma companies like J&J, allowing them to invest in innovation and capital building.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderJ&J carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Johnson & Johnson Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Johnson & Johnson Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Johnson & Johnson QuoteA better-ranked stock is Pfizer, Inc.

1999,PFE,"Shire plc (SHPG  -  Free Report) announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement with French company, Servier to sell its Oncology business. The deal is valued at $2.4 billion and includes global rights to leukemia drug, Oncaspar, and ex-U.S. rights to pancreatic cancer drug, Onivyde. Servier will also add another leukemia drug, Calaspargase Pegol, to its portfolio, which is under review in the United States.Shire’s oncology segment also includes immuno-oncology pipeline collaborations, comprising multiple early stage studies. Although the oncology segment has delivered high growth and profitability, it contributed lower than 2% to product sales in 2017.The company has initiated the sale of this segment as part of its long-term strategy to focus on rare disease leadership. Shire plans to return the proceeds from the sale to its shareholders through a share buyback. However, the buyback program will be initiated after Takeda Pharmaceutical’s  potential offer to acquire Shire, which is expected by Apr 25.Per the terms of the recent agreement, Servier will acquire the segment in an all cash deal, which is valued at an attractive revenue multiple of 9.2 times of 2017 revenues. The deal is not subject to shareholder approval and is expected to close in the second or third quarter of 2018.Shire is also looking to dispose of other non-strategic assets as part of the strategy.Shire shares have decreased 1.7% so far this year, comparing favorably with the industry’s decline of 3.2% in that period.Although investors cheered the news of a potential buyout of Shire by Takeda, with the sale of the oncology segment, Takeda is expected to reconsider its decision before making an offer. Oncology was one of the three core therapeutic areas which Takeda was looking to strengthen through Shire’s acquisition.However, a deal between Takeda and Shire is still expected to bring strategic synergies. Takeda acquired ARIAD Pharmaceuticals last year in a bid to strengthen and diversify its oncology business. The sale of Shire’s oncology segment may bring down the acquisition cost for Takeda.The investor community also believes that a formal takeover offer from Takeda may also trigger bids from other companies, which previously showed interest in Shire including AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report).Demand for companies with rare disease drugs in their portfolio or pipeline candidates are rising. This is evident from the billion dollar deals signed this year. Novartis is acquiring AveXis for $8.7 billion while Sanofi has spent nearly $16 billion to boost its rare blood disorder pipeline.Shire plc Price  Shire plc Price | Shire plc QuoteShire carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

2000,PFE,"The FlexShares Quality Dividend Defensive Index Fund (QDEF  -  Free Report) was launched on 12/14/2012, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Total Market (U.S.) ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?For a long time now, the ETF industry has been flooded with products based on market capitalization weighted indexes, which are designed to represent the broader market or a particular market segment.Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.There are some investors, though, who think it's possible to beat the market with great stock selection; this group likely invests in another class of funds known as smart beta, which track non-cap weighted strategies.This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.The smart beta space gives investors many different choices, from equal-weighting, one of the simplest strategies, to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting. However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.Fund Sponsor & IndexThe fund is managed by Flexshares, and has been able to amass over $302.89 M, which makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Total Market (U.S.) ETFs. This particular fund seeks to match the performance of the Northern Trust Quality Dividend Defensive Index before fees and expenses.The Northern Trust Quality Dividend Defensive Index is designed to provide exposure to a high-quality income-oriented portfolio of long-only U.S. equity securities, with an emphasis on long-term capital growth and a targeted overall beta that is generally between 0.5 to 1.0 times that of the Northern Trust 1250 Index that are selected based on expected dividend payment and fundamental factors.Cost & Other ExpensesWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor.

2001,PFE,"We expect Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports first-quarter 2018 results on May 1, before market open. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10.71%.The pharma giant has a strong record of earnings surprises. The company’s earnings surpassed expectations in each of the last four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 4.97%.Pfizer Inc. Price and EPS Surprise   Pfizer Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Pfizer Inc. QuotePfizer’s shares have risen 2.3% this year so far against a decrease of 4.3% for the industry. Factors at PlayIn the Innovative Health (IH) segment, new products like Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis) and Ibrance (breast cancer) as well as older products like Lyrica (neuropathic pain), Chantix (smoking cessation) and Eliquis (blood thinner) should contribute to the top line meaningfully. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Ibrance (worldwide), Lyrica (IH), Xeljanz and Chantix are $973 million, $1.19 billion, $396 million and $272 million, respectively.In the Essential Health (EH), biosimilars and emerging markets are expected to support sales.However, the loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for products, primarily Pristiq in the United States will continue to hamper top-line growth.Blockbuster drug Enbrel sales will continue to decline in the quarter due to biosimilar competition. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Enbrel is $540 million.The Prevnar/Prevenar 13 vaccines franchise may continue to see lower sales in United States while lower demand and generic competition should continue to hurt sales of Viagra.Pfizer is facing supply shortages for products from the legacy Hospira portfolio mainly due to capacity constraints and technical issues. We expect supply shortages will continue to hurt sales. Pfizer expects to cut down the sterile injectable shortages in 2019.New cancer drugs Bavencio/avelumab, Besponsa/inotuzumab ozogamicin and Mylotarg are likely to contribute to overall sales this time around.Xeljanz, Sutent and Bosulif were approved for line extensions in the fourth quarter of 2017. All these new products and line extensions are like to boost Q1 sales.The bottom line is expected to be driven by cost savings and share buybacks.We also expect management to provide an update on initial launch uptake for Pfizer and partner Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) newly approved oral SGLT-2 inhibitor, Steglatro (ertugliflozin) tablets. Apart from being approved as a monotherapy to treat type II diabetes, Steglatro has also been approved for use in combination with metformin under the brand name Segluromet and with Januvia under the brand name, Steglujan.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model shows that Pfizer is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.

2002,PFE,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that its smoking cessation drug, Chantix (varenicline) failed in a phase IV study, evaluating it in adolescent smokers. The study was being conducted as a regulatory post marketing commitment in smokers aged 12 to 16 years in the United States and 12 to 17 years in Europe.The complete study results are expected to be presented at an upcoming scientific congress and will be published later in a peer-reviewed medical journal.Chantix is already on the market as a prescription drug for helping adults aged 18 and over, along with counseling, to stop smoking.Shares of the company were down 3.1% on Mar 23. Meanwhile, Pfizer’s shares have declined 4.8% so far this year, compared with the industry’s decline of 5.8% in that period.The dose ranging multi-centre phase IV study evaluated Chantix for smoking cessation in nicotine dependent adolescents in combination with age-appropriate counselling. The study evaluated two dosages of the drug – 0.5 mg once and twice daily.Chantix failed to meet the primary endpoint of the four-week continuous abstinence rate compared to placebo at weeks 9 through 12.The adverse events observed in the study were similar to those seen in an earlier study conducted in adult smokers.Pfizer is planning to submit data from this study to the FDA for pediatric exclusivity determination. Pediatric exclusivity is granted for six months in return for conducting studies in pediatric patients. With the failure of the study on young smokers, it is unlikely to receive the exclusivity.In another setback for Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) terminated talks to buy the former’s consumer healthcare business. Last week, England-based Reckitt Benckiser also announced to drop its buyout plans for the segment.Pfizer Inc. Price  Pfizer Inc. Price | Pfizer Inc.

2003,PFE,"AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) has announced that its pipeline candidate, upadacitinib, met the primary endpoints in the 4th phase III study from its SELECT program, which evaluated the candidate for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Upadacitinib is an investigational oral JAK1-selective inhibitor, which is being studied as a once-a-day oral therapy.The phase III SELECT-COMPARE study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib (15 mg) compared with placebo and AbbVie’s marketed drug, Humira (adalimumab), over 12 weeks on patients with moderate-to-severe RA, who are on a stable background of methotrexate and had an inadequate response. In the study, upadacitinib met both the primary as well as secondary endpoints compared with placebo while showing superiority as compared to Humira.The primary endpoints of the study registered ACR20 responses and clinical remission. Data from the trial demonstrated that 71% of patients receiving the 15 m oral once-daily dose of upadacitinib 15 mg achieved an ACR20 response compared with 36% of patients receiving placebo at week 12. Moreover, 29% of subjects treated with upadacitinib achieved complete remission in comparison to 6% with placebo.Additionally, data from the study also showed that 45% of patients experienced low disease activity (secondary endpoint) when treated with upadacitinib compared with 29% receiving Humira and 14%, receiving placebo at week 12.Notably, SELECT-COMPARE is the fourth of the six ongoing phase III studies under the SELECT RA clinical trial program conducted on upadacitinib.We remind investors that last December, AbbVie announced that upadacitinib met the primary endpoints in the 3rd phase III study from its SELECT trial.Other researches are also underway on upadacitinib for treating Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and atopic dermatitis.Shares of AbbVie have rallied 42.7% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s 6.4% rise.Notably, AbbVie already has a strong presence in the RA market with its blockbuster drug, Humira. However, several companies are working on developing biosimilar versions of Humira which could induce competition in the market for the company. Also, the RA market is extremely crowded including drugs like Johnson & Johnson’s Simponi and UCB’s Cimzia among others.Significantly, Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) JAK inhibitor, Olumiant, was approved in the EU for RA last February and Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xeljanz is marketed in the United States for the same indication, which might pose a strong competition for upadacitinib on approval.Also, of late, Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) has announced resolution of the ongoing patent dispute with AbbVie regarding Biogen’s biosimilar version of Humira, in the EU. Per the settlement agreement, Biogen plans to launch Humira biosimilar in Europe by October, 2018.However, if upadacitinib is approved, it might reduce the potential negative impact of Humira generics on AbbVie’s top line.AbbVie Inc.

2004,PFE,"Shares of Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AGIO  -  Free Report) rallied almost 10% on Apr 9 after speculations were rife that the company might be acquired by other big players in the pharma and biotech industry. This bullish sentiment around the stock among investors was mainly triggered following Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) yesterday’s announcement that it has inked a deal to acquire the U.S. based clinical stage gene therapy company, AveXis, Inc .Particularly, Celgene which already notched up a collaboration agreement with Agios for developing novel therapies, utilizing Agios’ innovative cellular metabolism research platform is being considered a front runner in buying Agios.Let us have a look why Celgene or any other big drug biotech company may be interested in Agios:Shares of Agios have surged 49.1% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry’s increase of 11.4%. FDA’s last-year approval of the Agios’ only marketed drug, Idhifa (enasidenib), and the company’s rapid progress on a robust pipeline in the past year accompanied with some study initiations and positive readouts have steadily pushed up its share price. In August 2017, the FDA approved Idhifa for treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with an isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2) mutation. The drug provides a first-ever alternative treatment to patients living with the aforementioned indication in the United States. Notably, Idhifa also enjoys an Orphan Drug status in the EU for treatment of AML.Agios’ progress with the pipeline has also been quite impressive. The company has some interesting candidates in its portfolio including an IDH1 mutant inhibitor, AG-120 (ivosidenib) and a pan-IDH mutant inhibitor, AG-881.Last June, Agios presented positive data from the dose-escalation and expansion cohorts of the phase I study, evaluating single agent ivosidenib in mutant-positive cholangiocarcinoma at the ASCO.Ivosidenib is also being evaluated in a phase I expansion cohort for treatment of patients with IDH1m R/R AML. Data from the study demonstrated durable responses, which allowed the company to submit a new drug application to the FDA for ivosidenib, late last December.In the same month, the company also announced positive results from a phase I trial, assessing ivosidenib in combination with standard induction chemotherapy or Celgene’s Vidaza (Azacitadine) for treatment of newly diagnosed AML patients, not eligible for intensive chemotherapy.Presently, a phase III AGILE study examining ivosidenib in combination with Vidaza is also underway for the given indication.Apart from ivosidenib, Agios is conducting phase I programs on AG-881 for treatment of patients with advanced IDH1 or IDH2 mutant-positive solid tumors.The company has another interesting candidate in its portfolio. Its lead rare genetic diseases candidate, AG-348, is under evaluation in a phase II study on adult, transfusion-independent patients with Pyruvate kinase deficiency.A consistent progress with these investigational candidates makes Agios one of the most lucrative takeover options for other large players in the drug/biotech space at the moment.M&A activity is expected to be aggressive in the drug biotech sector this year following the new tax law. This was evident from Sanofi and Celgene already announcing two deals each. Also, Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) is aggressively on the lookout for a buyer to purchase its Consumer Healthcare unit after British firms Glaxo and Reckitt Benckiser Group pulled out of discussions. Moreover, this April, Japan-based Takeda Pharmaceutical announced its intention to acquire Shire plc.Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price | Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

2005,PFE,"Shares of vTv Therapeutics, Inc. (VTVT  -  Free Report) plummeted significantly after the company announced dismal results from the part A of the phase III trial, STEADFAST, on pipeline candidate, azeliragon.vTv Therapeutics’ stock has plunged 50.6% in the last six months as against the industry’s decline of 18.9%.  The candidate was being evaluated in patients suffering from Alzheimer’s disease. The results showed that the candidate did not meet co-primary efficacy endpoint as patients taking azeliragon versus placebo did not improve in cognitive or functional outcomes as measured by theAlzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) and the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-sb).The study comprised two independent and identical randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trials (part A and part B). The azeliragon treated group in part A showed a 4.4 point decline from baseline in ADAS-Cog and a 1.6 point dip from baseline in CDR-sb compared to a placebo fall of 3.3 and 1.6, respectively. However, these differences were not statistically significant. azeliragon was generally well-tolerated with a 25% withdrawal rate over 18 months that was similar in both the placebo and treatment arms.Consequently, vTv Therapeutics discontinued ongoing studies involving azeliragon, including the open-label extension study and part B of the STEADFAST study.Nevertheless, a substantial portion of patients in part B of STEADFAST will have completed 12 months of treatment under the study protocol.The failure of the late-stage study is disappointing for investors as the successful development and subsequent commercialization of the candidate would have significantly boosted growth prospects given the complexity of the drugs.Of late, there has been many failures of drugs being developed for Alzheimer’s. In February 2018, Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that it will stop the phase III study, APECS, which was evaluating verubecestat (MK-8931), an investigational small molecule inhibitor of the beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), in patients with prodromal Alzheimer’s disease. The decision was taken after an external Data Monitoring Committee, which assessed overall benefit/risk during a recent interim safety analysis, concluded that it was unlikely that positive benefit/risk was possible.  In January 2018, Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) announced plans to end its research efforts to discover new drugs for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) is another major company which has suffered many failures in its attempt to develop drugs for Alzheimer’s.Zacks RankvTv Therapeutics currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2006,PFE,"GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) has withdrawn from the race to buy Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Consumer Healthcare segment.Last October, Pfizer had said that it was exploring strategic alternatives for its Consumer Healthcare segment including a partial or a full separation through a spin-off, sale or other transaction. A decision regarding the same is expected to be made this year and it may ultimately opt to retain the businessGlaxo’s chief executive officer, Emma Walmsley said that management is interested in deals that will improve the company’s returns and not “compromise on its priorities for capital allocation”.Pfizer is having a tough time finding a buyer for its Consumer Healthcare segment, Last week, British company Reckitt Benckiser Group also pulled out of the discussion with Pfizer to buy the latter’s Consumer Health segment. After, Reckitt Benckiser backed out, Glaxo was seen as the frontrunner to buy Pfizer’s unit.Shares of Glaxo were up around 3.5% on Friday in response to this positive news. Glaxo’s stock has risen 7.3% this year so far, against a decline of 4.6% for the industry.In a separate press release, Pfizer announced that its shingles vaccine, Shingrix has gained regulatory approval in Japan and EU. Please note that Shingrix was approved in the United States and Canada in October last year. Also, Shingrix enjoys preferential recommendation from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). Last year, the ACIP recommended thepreferentialuse of Shingrix for prevention of shinglesover Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Zostavax.In yet another release, Glaxo announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of Europe has granted a positive opinion, recommending approval of Juluca,a two-drug regimen(dolutegravir and rilpivirine), once-daily, single pill for HIV.Juluca becomes the first two-drug pill to be approved in Europe.

2007,PFE,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) is one of the reputed names in the pharmaceutical sector, not just for its medicines and vaccines but also for its consumer healthcare products. This New York-based company is known for products like Prevnar, Lyrica, Lipitor and Celebrex among others.Pfizer’s shares have outperformed the large-cap pharma industry in the past six months. The stock has returned 9.9% in that timeframe compared with the industry’s gain of 4.8%.Pfizer’s outperformance was backed by decent quarterly results, positive news flow and regulatory updates.Here are five reasons to invest in the stock this year.Favorable Rank & Earnings Surprise Record: Pfizer has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Ithas been consistently beating earnings expectations.  Earnings surpassed expectations in each of last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 4.97%.The company is expected to record earnings and sales growth of 3.4% and 11.3%, respectively, in 2018. Meanwhile, estimates for 2018 and 2019 are up 6.1% and 4.1%, respectively in the past 30 days.Strategic Acquisitions & Collaborations: Pfizer has been working on strengthening its product portfolio as well as pipeline through acquisitions and licensing deals. The September 2016 takeover of Medivation strengthened Pfizer’s cancer franchise by adding prostate cancer treatment, Xtandi, to its portfolio. Xtandi is also being evaluated for various other types of cancer and holds immense potential. The June 2016 Anacor acquisition added Eucrisa (crisaborole) topical ointment for treating eczema to Pfizer’s pipeline. Pfizer estimates Eucrisa peak sales potential to be at least $2 billion.  The 2015 Hospira acquisition significantly expanded its sterile injectable and biosimilar capabilities.In addition to acquisitions, Pfizer is looking to drive growth through licensing deals and collaborative agreements. It has strategic deals with big names in the pharma sector like Merck & Co. (MRK  -  Free Report) (for lung cancer drug Xalkori’s combination and newly approved Steglatro and its fixed-dose combinations for type II diabetes), Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) (for Eliquis) and Glaxo (GSK  -  Free Report) (for its breast cancer drug Ibrance’s combination).Deep Pipeline: Pfizer has committed significant resources toward the development of treatments in the fields of oncology, cardiology, metabolic disorders, neuroscience, pain, rare diseases, immunology, inflammation and vaccines, and immuno-oncology. Most of these signify areas in which the company believes it can take leading positions. Pfizer expects approximately 25 to 30 drug approvals over the next five years, including around 15 products that have blockbuster potential, including line-extensions for Xtandi, Ibrance & Xeljanz/XR. Half of these potential blockbusters are expected to receive approval by 2020.Pfizer has been working on streamlining its R&D efforts and has several late-stage candidates in its pipeline including many immuno-oncology candidates.A key candidate in its immuno-oncology pipeline is Bavencio/avelumab,which is being evaluated for different types of cancer in collaboration with Merck KGaA. Bavencio is already marketedfor metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) and for advanced bladder cancer. Bavencio is being considered a key long-term growth driver for Pfizer.Exploring the World of Biosimilars: Pfizer markets two biosimilar versions of J&J/Merck’s blockbuster medicine, Remicade, in the United States – Inflectra and Ixifi. Inflectra was the first biosimilar monoclonal antibody available in the United States. Other biosimilars in late-stage development include biosimilar versions of Roche’s cancer drugs, Rituxan and Avastin and AbbVie’s Humira. A biosimilar version of Herceptin is under review in the United States and EU. Meanwhile, Pfizer is evaluating 14 biosimilar molecules in various stages of development.Aggressive Cost-Cutting Initiatives: With several of its products either facing or slated to face generic competition, Pfizer is looking toward cost-cutting initiatives to drive bottom-line growth. The company has been undertaking massive restructuring and cost-cutting measures for the past several years. Management is also looking to focus efforts on areas that have high potential like oncology and geographic regions like Asia. Pfizer achieved its cost-reduction goals that were announced in 2009 by the end of 2011, a year earlier than expected, and continues to generate cost savings. The company also achieved its target of bringing about a significant reduction in its annual R&D spend by the end of 2012.ConclusionPfizer faces its share of challenges in the form of genericization of key drugs, supply challenges in the legacy Hospira portfolio, pricing pressure and rising competition. However, we believe Pfizer will be able to overcome these headwinds in 2018.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2008,PFE,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) will report first-quarter 2018 results on May 1, before market open. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.26%.Merck’s performance has been pretty impressive, with the company exceeding earnings expectations in all the trailing four quarters. The average positive earnings surprise over the last four quarters is 8.54%Merck & Co., Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Merck & Co., Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Merck & Co., Inc. Quote Merck’s shares have risen 6.8% this year so far against a 4.3% decrease for the industry.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderMerck’s new products like cancer drugs Keytruda and Lynparza and Bridion Injection are likely to drive the top line. However, loss of market exclusivity for several drugs, softness in the diabetes (Januvia/Janumet) franchise, and lower sales of key products like Zostavax and Zepatier due to competitive pressure may hurt sales.Keytruda sales are being driven by the launch of new indications globally. Keytruda sales are gaining particularly from strong momentum in the indication of first-line lung cancer as it is the only anti-PD-1 approved in the setting.The Keytruda development program also significantly advanced in 2017 with regulatory approvals for six new indications in the United States, four in Europe and three in Japan. The approvals expanded the patient population, driving sales higher in the second half of 2017. This momentum is expected to be maintained in 2018 as well. Strong demand in most markets continues to drive sales of Bridion (sugammadex) Injection.However, rising competitive pressure has begun to hurt sales of relatively newer drugs like Zepatier. In the fourth quarter, Zepatier sales declined sequentially due to reduction in share and volume due to increasing competition. On the call, Merck had warned that the negative trend will continue in 2018 as most markets outside the United States will start to come under pressure.Among the older products, while continued pricing pressure is hurting sales of Januvia, lower demand due to competition is hurting sales of Isentress.Among the vaccines, Zostavax sales will continue to be hurt by strong competition from Glaxo’s (GSK  -  Free Report) newly approved shingles vaccines, Shingrix. Gardasil/Gardasil 9 sales were soft in the fourth quarter due to lower sales in the United States. Nonetheless, on the fourth-quarter call, the company had mentioned that underlying growth and increased coverage rates were still strong in the United States. It remains to be seen if Gardasil sales improve in the soon-to-be reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales of the Vaccine segment is pegged at $1.5 billion.Animal health franchise sales are likely to remain strong. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Animal Health segment sales is $1.05 billion.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Merck will beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is 0.00% as the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the Most Accurate estimate are pegged at 99 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Merck’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP.

The drug can now also be prescribed irrespective of BRCA-mutation in the second-line setting.The FDA approval was based on data from the confirmatory phase III study — ARIEL 3 which showed that Rubraca led to significant improvement in progression-free survival in such patients.Please note that Rubraca had received accelerated approval for the treatment of advanced BRCA-mutant ovarian cancer in third or later line setting in December 2016. With the latest approval, the accelerated approval was converted to regular one for this indication. The drug is under review in Europe for this indication with a decision expected in this quarter.Shares of Clovis were up 5.9% on Mar 6, after the news surfaced. However, the stock has lost 18.4% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s decline of 11.8%.With the latest approval, Rubraca comes at par with other approved PARP inhibitors for treatment of ovarian cancer — AstraZeneca’s (AZN  -  Free Report) Lynparza and TESARO’s (TSRO  -  Free Report) Zejula. All the drugs are now approved in patients irrespective of the BRCA-mutation status, creating a level playing field for all the players.Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) is also evaluating its PARP inhibitor, talazoparib, in a phase I study in several advanced or recurrent solid tumors.Moreover, earlier this February, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (“NCCN”) added Rubraca as maintenance therapy for third or later line ovarian cancer patients to its clinical practice guidelines in oncology ovarian cancer.The year 2018 has started well for Clovis with a positive recommendation for Rubraca’s approval in Europe in third or later line ovarian cancer patients, addition to the NCCN guidelines and the latest label expansion in the United States. Moreover, after a potential approval in Europe, Clovis will seek further approval of the drug as maintenance therapy in the expanded patient population.These positive developments are expected to boost the company’s top line. However, it remains to be seen how the three PARP inhibitors perform in an equally competing field.Meanwhile, a phase III confirmatory study, ARIEL4, is evaluating Rubraca compared with chemotherapy on patients, who have failed two prior lines of therapy. Clovis is also looking to expand Rubraca’s label into additional indications, like prostrate, breast and pancreatic cancers, among others either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents.Clovis Oncology, Inc.

2010,PFE,"Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) and partner Samsung Bioepis have announced resolution of an ongoing patent dispute with AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) regarding Biogen’s biosimilar version (Imraldi) of AbbVie’s blockbuster arthritis drug, Humira, in the EU. Per the settlement agreement, Biogen/Samsung Bioepis plans to launch Imraldi in Europe on Oct 16, 2018.Also in the United States, Samsung Bioepis entered into a settlement agreement with AbbVie, which would allow the former to bring Humira biosimilar into the U.S. market by Jan 31, 2023.Imraldi (or SB5) will be used for a whole range of indications including rheumatoid arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, active enthesitis-related arthritis, hidradenitis suppurativa and non-infectious uveitis.Notably, Imraldi is the second biosimilar version of Humira to be launched in the EU. Another biotechnology company, Amgen (AMGN), is also expected to launch its biosimilar version of Humira, in the EU come October this year as Amjevita, per a settlement with AbbVie.Notably, Amjevita was approved in the EU last March and approved in the United States in September 2016.In the United States, per settlement with AbbVie, Amjevita is likely to be launched on Jan 31, 2023.Shares of Biogen have underperformed its industry this year so far. The stock has lost 16.6% compared with the industry’s decrease of 6.3%.   We remind investors that Biogen has a joint venture with Samsung BioLogics for biosimilars called Samsung Bioepis, which already markets a couple of biosimilars in the EU, namely Flixabi, a biosimilar referencing J&J/Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Remicade and Benepali, a biosimilar referencing Amgen/Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Enbrel. This development in turn makes Imraldi the third anti-TNF biosimilar from Biogen to receive a marketing authorization in the EU.Biogen is also working with Samsung BioLogics to introduce new biosimilars to the market.Importantly, Biogen grossed biosimilar revenues of $380 million for a 12-month period ending December 2017 compared with $101 million, logged in 2016. This upside was primarily driven by Benepali, which recorded revenues of $370.8 million compared with the year-ago figure of $100.6 million on increased market share.Biogen Inc. Price Biogen Inc.

2012,PFE,"Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) has announced that the regulatory applications for its pipeline candidate, dacomitinib, have been accepted for review in both the United States and the EU. The company is looking to get the drug approved for the first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients with EGFR-activating mutations. Notably, the FDA granted a priority review to dacomitinib with a response expected in September 2018.The regulatory submissions for dacomitinib were based on positive data from a global head-to-head phase III ARCHER 1050 study, evaluating dacomitinib (n=227) versus AstraZeneca’s (AZN  -  Free Report) lung cancer drug, Iressa (gefitinib), among patients with NSCLC. Data from the study demonstrated a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 14.7 months on treatment with dacomitinib compared with 9.2 months with Iressa, reflecting a reduction in the risk of disease progression by 41%.However, 10% of patients treated with dacomitinib discontinued the study due to adverse events compared with 7% treated with Iressa. The company stated that a final assessment of overall survival from ARCHER 1050 study will be presented at a medical meeting later in 2018.Shares of Pfizer were up almost 1.3% following the news. However, the stock has gained 5.9% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s increase of 6.5%. Importantly, Pfizer’s regulatory application for another candidate, which has recently received acceptance in the United States is lorlatinib, for the second-line treatment of patients with NSCLC. A response from the FDA is awaited in August 2018.Non-small cell lung cancer occurs in 85% of patients with a lung cancer condition, the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Notably, EGFR mutations leading to growth in cancer cells occur in 10-35% of NSCLC tumors globally. Moreover, despite a significant progress made in this space, the disease is associated with low survival rates. Hence, approval of the candidate will provide the company with access to a huge patient-population base in need of an additional treatment to apprehend the disease.We remind investors that, Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, is approved in the first-line lung cancer setting. We also note that last month Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) has presented data on Tecentriq in novel combinations across a broad range of tumors including lung cancer.Blockbuster drugs like Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo is approved for treating NSCLC among others.Pfizer Inc.

2013,PFE,"After rising 16.3% last year, the Large Cap Pharmaceutical industry has risen 1.9% this year so far. It has however underperformed the 4% gain for the S&P 500 in the same time frame.Though the sector was off to a strong start in 2018, it struggled a little thereafter probably on broader market correction. Also, the mention of high drug prices by President Donald Trump in his State of the Union address hurt investor sentiment. However, the sector is largely expected to rebound as the year progresses.2017 was a good year for pharma and biotech stocks with the sector witnessing some positive developments that led to a much-awaited recovery.The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index gained 11.8% in 2017, in sharp contrast to the decline witnessed in 2016, which was a tough year for pharma stocks given the furor over rising drug prices.A key reason for the sector’s improved performance was the willingness of investors to look beyond the drug pricing controversy and focus more on fundamentals instead. Although the drug pricing controversy will remain a headline risk, investors appear more comfortable with the issue. Moreover, a significantly higher number of FDA approvals in 2017 restored investor confidence in the sector. The approval of the first gene cell therapy last year was a major breakthrough for the sector.Coming back to 2018, we believe that new product sales ramp up with rising demand, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results, more frequent FDA approvals, continued strong performance from key products, growing demand for drugs especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an aging population and increased health care spending are some of the factors that should keep the sector on track. A faster drug approval process and the proposed removal of outdated regulations that drive up costs and slow down innovation should also provide benefits.Possibilities of more mergers and acquisitions (M&As) are also high now that the tax reform is in place and big players are on the lookout for companies with innovative pipelines/technology. There has already been quite a bit of M&A buzz this year about potential deals. Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) have already announced two deals each.Meanwhile, with the Large-Cap Pharma industry being among the top 30% of the 256 Zacks-ranked industries, it would make sense to look at some Buy-ranked stocks in the space.Investing in stocks with a large market cap is a much more reliable investment because of the fact that they control a large portion of their given industry. Also companies with a larger market cap have performed well in 2017 and look well poised to earn higher profits in 2018.Here is a look at four large-cap pharma companies that sport a favorable Zacks Rank -- #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy).H. Lundbeck A/S (HLUYY  -  Free Report)Denmark-based Lundbeck specializes in psychiatric and neurological disorders. The company’s key areas of focus include depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. According to Lundbeck, about 700 million people across the world suffer from psychiatric and neurological disorders with many receiving inadequate treatment.YTD, Lundbeck has outperformed the Large-Cap Pharmaceutical industry with shares gaining 4.7%. In addition to delivering revenue growth of 12% (in local currencies) in 2017, Lundbeck issued an upbeat outlook for 2018. Estimated earnings growth for the current year is 31.2%. Meanwhile, earnings estimates for 2019 are up 8.5% over the past 30 days.AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report)AbbVie beat estimates for both earnings and sales in the fourth quarter. It also raised its earnings expectations for 2018 based on continued strong operational performance. AbbVie’s key drug, Humira has been performing well based on strong demand trends, despite new competition. AbbVie’s shares have outperformed the industry in the past year, supported by a series of positive news including promising data from several pivotal studies, regulatory nods, including approval for its competitive HCV medicine Mavyret and two approvals for Imbruvica, and settlement of its Humira patent disputes with biotech major, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report).AbbVie’s shares are up an impressive 22.3% this year so far, outperforming the industry.Estimated earnings growth for the current year is 33.9%. Meanwhile, estimates for 2018 and 2019 are up 8.4% and 7% respectively, over the past 30 days.Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report)New York-based, Pfizer is one of the most well-known names in the pharmaceutical sector not just for its medicines and vaccines but also for its consumer healthcare products.Pfizer reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2017 results as it beat estimates for earnings as well as sales and provided an upbeat outlook for 2018. We believe that Pfizer’snew products like Ibrance, contribution from acquisitions, cost cuts and share buybacks should help the company earn profits in the future quarters. Pfizer’s shares have risen 1.6% this year so far.Estimated earnings growth for the current year is 11.3%. Meanwhile, estimates for 2018 and 2019 are up 6.1% and 4.1%, respectively, over the past 30 days.Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO  -  Free Report)The year 2017 was eventful for this Denmark-based pharma giant as it gained regulatory approvals for some key pipeline drugs/candidates including fast-acting insulin aspart - Fiasp, once-daily pre-filled pen - Ozempic and hemophilia B treatment Rebinyn. Meanwhile, strong performance of Victoza is driving top-line growth. We believe these new products and a solid pipeline will pave the way for growth this year for the company.Over the past 30 days, earnings estimates have risen 1.5% and 4.9%, respectively, for 2018 and 2019. Estimated earnings growth for the current year is 13.7%.While Pfizer, AbbVie and Novo Nordisk are all Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks, Lundbeck is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.

2014,PFE,"Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) announced that its new advanced breast cancer treatment Verzenio (abemaciclib) has gained FDA approval in first-line setting.With the latest approval, Verzenio is approved in combination with an aromatase inhibitor (AI -either anastrozole or letrozole) as initial endocrine-based therapy in postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2- advanced/metastatic breast cancer who have had no prior systemic treatment for the advanced disease.Lilly’s shares have declined 5% this year so far while the industry recorded an increase of 0.8%.The approval was based on positive interim results from MONARCH 3 study. The study compared Verzenio, a CDK 4/6 inhibitor, plus an AI versus an AI plus placebo in the above mentioned patients. Data from the study showed that Verzenio plus an AI substantially reduced tumor size and delayed disease progression in such patientsVerzenio is already marketed for two breast cancer indications - as a monotherapy for the treatment of HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer who had prior endocrine therapy and chemotherapy for metastatic disease; and as a combination therapy with AstraZeneca's (AZN  -  Free Report) Faslodex (fulvestrant)in HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer patients who had disease progression following endocrine therapy.Verzenio was launched in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2017 and generated sales of $21 million in the first quarter of its launch. We believe that Verzenio’s label expansion in the previously untreated breast cancer population would drive sales higher in future quarters. Verzenio is under review in the EU.Other available CDK4/6 inhibitors in the market include Pfizer, Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Ibrance and Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) Kisqali.Lilly carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2015,PFE,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended that two of its hematology medicines be granted marketing authorizations in the EU. However, the committee gave a negative opinion, recommending against label expansion of Pfizer’s kidney cancer medication, Sutent.The CHMP recommended approval of Mylotarg in combination with standard chemotherapy for the treatment of patients aged 15 years and above with newly diagnosed CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML), except acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Mylotarg was approved in the United States in September last year.CHMP also granted a positive opinion for the label expansion of another leukemia drug Bosulif for the first-line treatment of patients suffering from chronic phase Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Bosulif was approved in the first-line setting for Ph+ CML in the United States in December last year.However, the CHMP recommended against approving the label expansion of Sutent as an adjuvant treatment in patients at high risk of recurrent advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), following nephrectomy (surgical removal of the cancer-containing kidney).Please note that Sutent was approved for use in the same patient population in the United States in November last year. It is the only adjuvant therapy approved for recurrent RCC, the most common type of kidney cancer.Though the European Commission (EC) is not bound to follow the CHMP’s opinion, it usually does so.Bosulif recorded sales of $40 million in the developed Europe region in 2017, recording growth of 43% year over year while Sutent’s sales of $323 million in the same region declined 4%.Shares of Pfizer are up 2.4% so far this year, comparing favorably with a 0.7% increase for the industry.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderPfizer carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2016,PFE,"The last week has been an eventful one for pharma stocks with Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) announcing that it is acquiring gene therapy company AveXis while Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced successful study results. In other news, Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) kidney cancer drug, Inlyta missed primary endpoint in a phase III study.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesNovartis to Buy AveXis for $8.7 Billion: The big news early in the week was Novartis’ $8.7 billion deal to buy AveXis whose lead product candidate AVXS-101 is a one-time gene replacement therapy for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). A regulatory filing for AVXS-101 in the United States is expected in the second half of this year. AVXS-101 has the potential to generate millions of dollars for Novartis, if approved. The company agreed to pay $218 for each share of AveXis, representing a whooping premium of 88% to AveXis’ closing price on Friday.With boards of both the companies having approved the deal, the buyout is anticipated to close in the second half of the year. (Read More: Novartis Inks $8.7 Billion Gene Therapy Deal to Buy AveXis)Merck’s Keytruda Succeeds in Another Key Lung Cancer Study: A pivotal lung cancer study, KEYNOTE-042, on Merck’s blockbuster PD-1 inhibitor, Keytruda met the primary endpoint. The KEYNOTE-042 study evaluated patients with locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous or squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors express PD-L1 protein levels of 1 percent or greater  (TPS of ≥1 percent). In such patients, Keytruda showed a significant survival benefit compared with platinum-based chemotherapy.Notably, Keytruda monotherapy is already marketed for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 protein levels of 50 percent or greater (TPS of ≥50 percent).If the OS data from KEYNOTE-042 study are approved to be included in Keytruda’s label, the drug can be prescribed to treat an expanded lung cancer patient population, further reinforcing its position in the lung cancer market.

The phase III study, SELECT-COMPARE, evaluated the candidate for moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis in patients who are on a stable background of methotrexate and elicited an inadequate response.After 12 weeks of treatment, the ACR20 response — the first primary endpoint — was achieved in 71% of the patients receiving the 15 mg dose of upadacitinib versus 36% for placebo. The second primary endpoint of clinical remission was achieved by 29% of the patients in the upadacitinib arm versus only 6% in the placebo arm. (Read More: AbbVie's RA Candidate Meets Primary Endpoints in Phase III)Meanwhile, the FDA has extended the review period for AbbVie’s pipeline candidate elagolix by three months. The FDA’s decision, previously expected in the second quarter, will now come in the third quarter. (Read More: FDA Prolongs Review Date for AbbVie Endometriosis Candidate)Pfizer’s Inlyta Misses Primary Endpoint in Phase III Study: Pfizer’s kidney cancer drug Inlyta (axitinib) failed to demonstrate a clear improvement in the primary endpoint of extending disease-free survival (DFS) compared with placebo in the phase III ATLAS study. Accordingly, an independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended the study be stopped at a planned interim analysis. (Read More: Pfizer’s Kidney Cancer Drug Misses Endpoint in Phase III).Pfizer also announced initiation of dosing in an early-stage study evaluating its mini-dystrophin gene therapy candidate, PF-06939926, for the treatment of boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the most common type of muscular dystrophy. Early data from the study is expected in the first half of 2019.Pacira’s Exparel Gets FDA Nod for Expanded Label: Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (PCRX  -  Free Report) supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for label expansion of Exparel in the nerve block setting for patients undergoing upper extremity surgeries got the FDA nod. The FDA’s approval came as a surprise after an FDA Committee voted six to four against approval of the expanded indication in February.

2017,PFE,"U.S. stocks not only suffered their worst week in more than two years but are also on the brink of logging the worst March. Trump-China trade war rhetoric is threatening global economic growth, while a tighter monetary policy is about to hinder the bull run that began almost a decade ago.A third party firm improperly keeping Facebook, Inc.

This in turn disrupted tech’s growth trajectory, which for long helped the broader market scale north.With the markets going through a rough patch, investing in stocks that provide excellent risk-adjusted returns seems judicious.Stocks to Face Worst MarchIt has been a rough month for the broader market. The Dow Jones is on the verge to see its worst March after it had tanked 8.97% almost 40 years back, per the WSJ Market Data Group. In fact, the blue-chip gauge lost more than 1,400 points over the last five trading sessions, marking the index’s steepest weekly percentage loss since 2016.The broader S&P 500 is also on the brink of its ugliest March in 17 years, when it had slumped 6.4%. The benchmark index turned negative for the year and is around 10% below its all-time high hit earlier this year. In addition, the tech-laden Nasdaq will witness an excruciating March decline since 2001. Meanwhile, Wall Street’s so-called fear-gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index, soared 57% last week, well above its long-term average of 20. This invariably shows that bearish bets continue to outdo their bullish counterparts in the indices so far this month.But, what has triggered such a selloff leading to U.S. stocks ending in their worst week in years?Restrictive Trade Policy, Rising Interest RatesSelling in stocks intensified after the Trump administration announced that it will levy tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of Chinese imports on top of imposing duties on foreign steel and aluminum. In response to Trump’s tariffs, Beijing said that it will target 128 U.S. products with an import value of $3 billion. These products mostly include U.S pork, fresh fruit, dried fruits, steel pipes, modified ethanol, ginseng and wine.Such heated trade rhetoric doesn’t bode well for the American economy. If a full-fledged trade war takes place, the United States might slip into a recession in the near future and the jobless rate might more than double from current levels. Tariffs on the U.S. will lead to rise in inflation along with an uptick in import prices, provoking the Fed to hike rates. And we all know that easy monetary policy so far has helped the U.S. stock market celebrate its nine-year bull run. Investors had piled up on U.S. stocks with the notion that quantitative easing will help the domestic economy grow at a better rate than emerging economies like China.Fed, by the way, has tightened its monetary policy. At the conclusion of the FOMC meeting on Mar 21, Jerome Powell-led Federal Reserve hiked interest rates by a quarter-percentage point and projected a steeper path of rate hikes in 2019 and 2020. The vote to lift the benchmark lending rate was a unanimous 8-0. Thus, the broader market might keep falling as long as the Fed continues to remain hawkish.The Facebook FiascoAdding to the downbeat tone is a sharp selloff in the technology sector. Investors remained concerned about tighter regulations for large tech companies. Lest we forget, tech shares have gained the most so far this year.However, the sector took a beating following the backlash over Facebook’s handling of user data. Everyone raised questions as to how Cambridge Analytica, which worked on Trump’s election campaign, had gained access to personal data on roughly 50 million Facebook users without their knowledge. Facebook shares saw a weekly decline of 14%, the biggest since 2012. Other tech behemoths, including Apple and Google-parent Alphabet, lost more than 7% in the week.Time to Buy 5 Ultra-Safe StocksAs March is plagued by fears of a trade war, rising rates and data mining scandal, investing in low-risk assets and a combination of parameters that lead to better returns seems judicious.The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of low-beta stocks, which are inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in.

2018,PFE,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) of the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) adopted a positive opinion for the marketing authorization of the proposed biosimilar of Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Remicade (infliximab).The CHMP recommended the approval of the biosimilar for all the indications of the branded drug across gastroenterology, rheumatology and dermatology. We note that Remicade is approved to treat Crohn's Disease in adults and children, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and plaque psoriasis.The positive opinion was based on a comprehensive data package that is expected to confirm the biosimilarity of infliximab to the original drug with analytical, preclinical and clinical data matching across quality, efficacy and safety.Earlier, the phase III confirmatory study in rheumatoid arthritis (REFLECTIONS B537-02) met its primary endpoint, demonstrating equivalent efficacy of proposed Sandoz biosimilar infliximab to the reference medicine as measured by the American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR20) response at week 14.  Novartis’ shares have declined 4.5% over a year, compared with the industry’s fall of 3.7%.Novartis generic arm, Sandoz, is a leader in biosimilars with five marketed products. The marketed biosimilars include — Omnitrope, a human growth hormone; Binocrit, an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent used to treat anemia; filgrastim for neutropenia under the brand names Zarzio outside the United States and Zarxio in the United States; Rixathon (biosimilar rituximab), approved in Europe in 2017 to treat blood cancers and immunological diseases (also approved in the EU as Riximyo under a duplicate marketing authorization); and Erelzi (biosimilar etanercept), approved in Europe in 2017 to treat multiple inflammatory diseases.  The FDA also approved biosimilar Erelzi in 2016. However, the launch is pending in the United States due to an ongoing litigation with Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report).EMA is due to review CHMP’s opinion.  We note that Sandoz acquired the biosimilar of infliximab from Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) in February 2016 for the 28 EU countries plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein that form the EEA. Per the terms, Pfizer retains commercialization and manufacturing rights to infliximab (PF-06438179) in countries outside the EEA.Meanwhile, Sandoz has quite a number of biosimilars in its pipeline. A tentative approval will further boost the company’s generic division. The company has also filed for approval of a biosimilar of adalimumab and pegfilgrastim in the EU.Apart froma strong generic portfolio, Novartis has a strong oncology portfolio of drugs like Afinitor, Exjade, Jakavi, Zykadia, Tasigna, Jadenu, and Kisqali. The recent approval of Kymriah for acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a major boost for Novartis given the potential in the CAR-T therapy space.Zacks RankNovartis carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2019,PFE,"The healthcare industry is entering a period of significant changes. Software and new technologies are gradually beginning to revolutionize the industry.Drug/biotech companies constantly strive to bring differentiated and high-quality medicines, vaccines and consumer healthcare products to as many people as possible.To bring a successful drug on the market, these companies spend millions of dollars and several years in research and development (R&D) activities. However, many candidates fail in studies and never reach patients. Biotech, medical research and drug discovery involve significant expenditure. It is thus very important for the research landscape to change.Major advances in science and technology are transforming the way scientists conduct research on diseases and are likely to improve diagnosis and treatment in the future.Here we discuss three emerging technologies, which the pharma/biotech industry has started adopting, albeit slowly. These are poised to transform the sector by saving both time and cost.Artificial Intelligence & Machine LearningArtificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.Drug/biotech companies are analyzing the huge amount of data in their database by applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to identify patterns in ways that humans cannot. Artificial intelligence driven solutions are enabling pharma/biotech companies to identify the appropriate patient population, reduce or eliminate the need for some studies, and in some cases even predict outcomes in a virtual patient.Several collaborations have been formed in the past couple of years between big pharma/biotech players and AI-driven companies, primarily startups to discover novel biological targets and molecules for pharma players using AI. For example, last year, Glaxo (GSK  -  Free Report) collaborated with two external companies - Exscientia, a UK specialist in machine-learning and Insilico Medicine, a U.S. leader in AI-led drug discovery - to harness AI.Also, last year, Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) pharma arm, Genentech formed a research partnership with GNS Healthcare to power cancer drug development with the latter’s REFS causal machine learning and simulation AI platform. AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) also collaborated with Boston-based BERG last year to use artificial intelligence for discovering novel targets and therapeutics to treat neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease.J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report), Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) have collaborations with IBM’s (IBM  -  Free Report) Watson Health unit to leverage the latter’s AI solutions and applications for drug discovery and accelerate primarily cancer research efforts of these companies.Pfizer, J&J, Glaxo carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.  Artificial intelligence has been touted as the next big emerging technology in the biotech industry as it can drastically reduce the time and cost it takes to develop new life-saving drugs.A significant amount of time is invested in identifying a potential disease target and testing whether a drug candidate can hit that target. With the use of AI, it is estimated that the drug design timeframe can be cut down from 4-5 years to one year while also drastically reducing the costs.Though AI is in the relatively early stages of being used in biotech for drug discovery and other purposes, a broad-scale adoption is expected by 2025.3D Bio-PrintingThree dimensional printing or 3D printing is a prototyping technology by which different materials are fused under computer control to create a three-dimensional object. Add biology/cells to the process and it becomes a new technique – 3D bioprinting. These printers are used to manufacture human tissues/muscles as well as organs and bones that can be implanted into living humans.3D printing technology, also known as additive manufacturing, is leading to major innovations in medicine manufacturing, particularly personalized medicines. Compared to conventional manufacturing systems, 3D bioprinters offer benefits like high production rates, better precision and accuracy and reduces material wastage, which can save costs.Though still new to pharmaceutical drug research and development, 3D printing has been in use in the medical devices sector for many years and is mainly used to make dental implants and custom prosthetics.The first 3D printed prescription drug, Spritam, to treat epilepsy was approved by the FDA in 2015 and launched in the United States in 2016. It was made by private company Aprecia Pharmaceuticals using its Zip Dose technology.It is expected that 3D printing has great potential to revolutionize the field of drug manufacturing. It could be used for printing drug tablets with a personalized dosage, drugs with different release rates and for printing living tissue. In 2016, Texas-based Nano3D BioSciences developed a novel assay for vasoactivity using its core 3D cell culture platform, magnetic 3D bioprinting in partnership with AstraZeneca.Glaxo is working on a project to decide if it should invest in 3D printing of drugs.Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) Internet of Medical Things brings together medical devices and applications and technology that procure vital data in real time. Chronic diseases, which require frequent monitoring, can be tracked effectively so that patients receive timely and proper treatment. Wearable devices like Apple Watch, Fitbit and Samsung S Health help users achieve their fitness and health targets.It could well be the future of healthcare as pharma and medical device companies look to innovate and keep up with technology to help patients and physicians better monitor and track diseases.According to a report by Allied Market Research, the IoT healthcare market will reach $136 billion worldwide by 2021, registering CAGR of 12.5% over 2015-2021.  This is because it has the potential to transform the healthcare industry in terms of delivery, affordability, and reliability.Pharma and tech companies are now taking things a step further and collaborating to make devices that can track chronic and lifestyle associated diseases like diabetes, which are becoming rampant.In fact, the scope for innovation in this area — contact lenses that can detect glucose levels, devices that monitor caloric intake, bioelectronic medicines that may treat a wide range of chronic diseases, robotic-assisted surgery — is seemingly endless.ConclusionWhile the healthcare space is growing by leaps and bounds with these emerging technologies, mounting concerns around privacy, data protection and governance prevail. Also, many of the AI and 3D bioprinting research companies overestimate their achievements, something that drug/biotech companies should be wary of. Nonetheless, these nascent technologies hold ample promise and their proper execution will definitely prove to be a trump card for the space.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2020,PFE,"The U.S. stock market mostly see-saws during the pre-midterm election period and rallies once the uncertainty fades, say analysts at The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report). The scenario is not expected to be any different this time around. Investors should brace for increased turbulence as a divided government is highly expected this election.The last several months, in fact, have seen extreme levels of volatility as investors remained concerned about more protectionist trade policies and spike in bond yields after prices of essential commodities continued to move north. Given such uncertainty, investing in stocks that provide excellent risk-adjusted returns seems judicious.Brace for Months of UncertaintyInvestors should brace for neck-snapping volatility as midterm election approaches, per Goldman. The broader market has been on a roller-coaster ride for the past few months, thanks to trade and tax polic, along with geopolitical tensions. Controversies surrounding Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into whether Trump colluded with Russia’s initiative to impede the 2016 presidential election have aggravated concerns.Thus, corporate profits and economic reports might have been crucial factors for stocks but political developments have continued to determine the direction of the market.In the last 11 midterm election years since 1974, the S&P 500 managed to eke out gains in April, but, mostly traded flat through September only to rally once political uncertainty waned, per Goldman. In fact, in those years, stock market volatility averaged 15% compared with the median of 12% in all years.This year is likely to be the same. After all, Democrats are poised to regain control over the House of Representatives even though Republicans are expected to maintain an upper hand in the Senate, based on recent polls. Goldman forecasts that Democrats will have nearly a 70% chance of repossessing the House but there is less than 40% chance of regaining a majority in the Senate. Goldman added that such a divided government doesn’t bode well for investors.Volatility Makes a Dramatic ComebackVolatility has already seen several days with sharp moves so far this year. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), the so-called Wall Street’s fear index, has seen a jump of no less than 20% in at least six trading sessions this year, according to the WSJ Market Data Group.The volatility index has experienced 19 sessions so far this year where it ended up at least 5%, the highest since 1994. In fact, volatility doubled on Feb 5 as inflation concerns dragged the broader market down.Such earth-shattering volatility followed a relatively calm 2017.  Last year, the stock market shrugged off political and economic uncertainty, and demonstrated almost nothing in the way of market pullbacks.Bond Yields Spike, Equities WobbleSpike in U.S. bond yields, by the way, have triggered market gyrations. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note hit its highest level since January 2014 at 2.97% in early European trade. The 10-year yield increased as treasuries came under pressure. Treasuries sold off as higher commodity prices diminish the value of a bond’s fixed interest payments. Rise in oil prices and business houses saying that the cost of steel and several other raw materials are increasing in the United States have induced inflation fears.Rise in bond yields affected the buying appetite for stocks. Uptick in bond yields increased the opportunity cost of investing in equities and therefore equities became less alluring. Selling pressure on U.S. equity benchmarks intensified on Apr 20, with all three major bourses retracing into the negative territory.5 Top Stocks to Counter Market GyrationsGiven the aforesaid factors, it seems like Wall Street is poised to face months of volatility with midterms just around the corner. Taking this into consideration, investors should build a strategy on low-risk assets and a combination of parameters that lead to better returns. The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of low-beta stocks, which are inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in.

2021,PFE,"With smart investment becoming the buzzword in today’s investment world, millennials are frequently inclining toward hybrid investment patterns rather than traditional pure play theories like value or growth.The logic behind this is the effectiveness of a mixed investment strategy as value or growth investing approaches come with their own share of pitfalls. A pure play value investor misses the chance of betting on stocks that have bright long-term prospects. The same way, growth investors often end up investing in expensive stocks. In other words, to make a long-term investment more effective, the principles of both value and growth strategies need to be combined.The quest for a mixed investment strategy led to the introduction of the GARP (growth at a reasonable price) approach. What GARPers look for is whether the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential (Investopedia).One of the fundamental metrics for finding GARP is the price/earnings growth ratio (PEG). Although it is categorized under value investing, this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing.The PEG ratio is defined as: (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth RateIt relates the stocks P/E ratio with future earnings growth rate.While P/E alone only gives the idea of stocks, which are trading at a discount, PEG while adding the GROWTH element to it, helps to find those stocks that have solid future potential.A lower PEG ratio, preferably less than 1, is always better for GARP investors.Say for example, if a stock's P/E ratio is 10 and expected long-term growth rate is 15%, the company's PEG will come down to 0.66, a ratio which indicates both undervaluation and future growth potential.Unfortunately, this ratio is often neglected due to investors' limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock.There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though. It doesn't consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at very high growth rate followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy:PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (For more accurate valuation purpose)Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1  or #2 have a proven history of success.)Market Capitalization greater than $1 Billion (This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity.)Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5%:Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.Value Score of less than or equal to B:Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold) offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 17 stocks that qualified the screening:Pfizer Inc.

2022,PFE,"The Fearless Girl facing the Manhattan financial district's famous Charging Bull near Wall Street will get a new permanent home by the end of this year in front of the New York Stock Exchange. Despite several criticism, the statue has become a tourist destination and a global symbol of female business prowess since its installation more than a year ago.About The Fearless GirlShe is a ponytailed, young, four-foot-tall bronze monument with fists on hips and chin held high as a symbol of empowerment. State Street Global Advisors at Bowling Green Park on Broadway Street originally installed the sculpture on the eve of International Women’s Day 2017. The Fearless Girl is a growing symbol for gender equality and the power of women in leadership. It spreads a message to encourage companies to recruit women to their board. The plaque at the statue’s feet reads “Know the power of women in leadership. SHE makes a difference.”The ‘Fearless Girl’ is part of a campaign by State Street to encourage companies to add more women to their boards and to advertise SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity Index ETF (SHE  -  Free Report), which comprises gender-diverse companies that have a relatively high percentage of women among their senior leadership.Inside SHEThis ETF offers exposure to U.S. companies that demonstrate greater gender diversity within senior leadership than other firms in their sector by tracking the SSGA Gender Diversity Index. Holding 168 stocks, it is moderately concentrated on the top firms as each account for less than 5.8% of assets. Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) and Mastercard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) are top three holdings. From a sector look, information technology takes the largest share at 22.2%, followed by healthcare (16.4%), consumer staples (13.1%) and consumer discretionary (12.0%). SHE has returned 10.2% over the past year versus the gain of 15.45% for the broad market fund (SPY  -  Free Report).Impact On Women-LeadershipOut of 700 companies in the United States, Britain and Australia that had no women serving on their boards, more than 150 companies have added a female director to their boards since the placement of the bronze girl statue, with another 34 pledging to do so. Currently, women make up 5% of CEOs in the Fortune 500 companies and 17% of the corporate board members among Fortune 500 companies.Today, a record number of women are in power this year. In the United States, 32 Fortune 500 CEOs are women, three women are in the Supreme Court, and three of the last eight U.S. Secretaries of State were women. Last year, 15 of 146 world leaders were women, eight of whom served as their country’s first female leaders. Some of the famous women leaders include Angela Merkel and Dilma Rousseff.In the corporate world, Indra Nooyi, CEO of PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report); Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook (FB  -  Free Report); Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors (GM  -  Free Report); Angela Ahrendts, Senior Vice-President of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report); Denise Morrison, CEO of Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report); and Michele Buck, CEO of Hershey (HSY  -  Free Report) are leaders in their own right. Per several researches, companies led by women have a long history of outperformance.Bottom LinePlacing the Fearless Girl right next to the NYSE is the perfect metaphor to promote more companies to hire women to their boards, according to the State Street Global Advisors. With the move, the Fearless Girl will be more powerful standing alone outside NYSE than the her current home turf, which she shares with the Charging Bull. Hopefully, she will continue to stimulate the power of having women in leadership.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2023,PFE,"GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25 before market open. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 4.35%.Shares of Glaxo shares have outperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has gained 12.9% against the industry’s decline of 4.3%. Glaxo’s earnings performance has been pretty impressive so far. The company’s bottom line surpassed estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters and meeting the same in the remaining one. Overall, the company came up with an average beat of 2.12%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors to Consider                                            Glaxo should continue to see strong sales in its Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines business segment.The company’s Pharmaceuticals segment is expected to be driven by solid sales of new HIV products, Tivicay and Triumeq. Sales of lately launched respiratory drugs, the Ellipta products and Nucala are likely to offset the declines in sales of older respiratory products, namely Seretide, Advair and Avodart.  On fourth-quarter 2017 conference call, Glaxo stated that its inhaled respiratory products, particularly the older ones, are grappling with persistent competitive and pricing pressures, expected to continue through 2018.Meanwhile, many of Glaxo’s key drugs, Lovaza and Avodart, are facing a sales decline due to generic competition, a trend we expect to carry on in Q1 as well. It is important to note that pricing dynamics and rivalry woes are hurting the sales of the company’s top-selling drug, Advair, in the United States while generic competition is hampering the same in Europe.The Vaccines segment is likely to consistently benefit from a sustained uptake of meningitis vaccines like Bexsero and Menveo {acquired from Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report)}.Moreover, Glaxo’s Shingrix vaccine (prevention of shingles), approved in the United States last October generated better-than-expected initial sales in the previous quarter. In the upcoming quarter, we expect a significant contribution from the drug to the company’s sales. Sales gained from a favorable recommendation from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices over Merck’s Zostavax. Moreover, Shingrix was approved in the EU as well as in Japan last month for the given indication, which might fetch in some additional sales.Additionally, in 2017, Glaxo received approvals for two other key new drugs, namely Trelegy Ellipta, which provides three medicines in a single inhaler to treat COPD and Juluca (dolutegravir and rilpivirine), the first 2-drug regimen, once-daily, single pill for HIV. These are also expected to drive the company’s top line.Last month, Glaxo announced that it has entered into an agreement with Novartis to buy out the latter’s stake in their Consumer Healthcare joint venture. With this acquisition, Glaxo will now stake a 100% ownership claim over its Consumer Healthcare unit including products such as Sensodyne and Flonase. We expect management to further discuss about the deal in the to-be-reported quarter.Importantly, sales growth is on the wane in the Consumer Healthcare Segment due to generic competition to Transderm Scop, divestments as well as the impact of the general sales tax in India. The Consumer Healthcare segment is anticipated to remain under stress in the first quarter and is not much predicted to push up the sales.Meanwhile, cost savings from restructuring and continued efficiencies should boost operating profits.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Glaxo is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Glaxo has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 70 cents.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with ourEarnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Glaxo carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.GlaxoSmithKline plc Price and EPS Surprise GlaxoSmithKline plc Price and EPS Surprise | GlaxoSmithKline plc Quote Stocks to ConsiderHere are a couple of health care stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this time around:Pfizer Inc.

2024,PFE,"Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) will report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, before market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.56%.Lilly’s shares have declined 5.5% this year so far, underperforming the industry 's decrease of 4.3%.Lilly’s performance has been pretty impressive with earnings beating expectations in each of the last four quarters, bringing the average positive surprise to 4.08%.Eli Lilly and Company Price and EPS Surprise  Eli Lilly and Company Price and EPS Surprise | Eli Lilly and Company QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors to ConsiderLike the previous couple of quarters, strong uptake trends of new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Cyramza, Jardiance and Lartruvo should make up for the decline in sales of established products like Zyprexa, Alimta, Cialis, Strattera and Effient.While Trulicity sales are being driven by growth in the GLP-1 market and market share gains, Jardiance sales are likely to be driven by increased market share within the growing SGLT2 class. The positive trend is expected to continue in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Trulicity first-quarter revenues is $586 million.Continued strong uptake outside the United States is likely to drive sales of Cyramza. Strong launch uptake is expected to drive sales of Taltz and Lartruvo.The loss of exclusivity in some countries for Cymbalta, Strattera, Effient, Axiron, Zyprexa and Evista will continue to hurt volumes. Also, lower demand in the United States due to competitive pressure mainly from immuno-oncology agents is hurting Alimta sales in the country – a trend which we believe persisted in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Alimta sales in the first quarter is pegged at $466 million.Olumiant (baricitinib) was launched in select European countries and in Japan in 2017 and generated sales of $46 million in the year supported by a strong launch uptake in Germany, The drug is under review in the United States. Lilly and partner Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) re-submitted the NDA for baricitinib in January.Verzenio, which was launched in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2017, generated sales of $21 million. We expect the new cancer drug to generate higher sales in the first quarter. Also, this advanced breast cancer treatment gained FDA approval in the first-line setting in February, which might have led to additional sales in the first quarter.Some older products like Humulin and Forteo are expected to do well while others like Cialis are likely to see weak sales due to lower demand.Elanco Animal Health segment sales were hurt by global competitive pressure in 2017, a trend that may have continued in the first quarter. On the fourth-quarter conference call, management had said that after being slightly negative in the first half of 2018, Animal Health revenues are expected to improve in the second half supported by new product launches. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales in the Animal Health segment is $770 million.Lilly is exploring strategic alternatives for this business including a sale, merger or creating a separate company through an initial public offer. A decision regarding the same is expected to be announced in July and Lilly may ultimately opt to retain the business. Investors may look for an update on the first-quarter conference call.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Lilly will beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is -0.08%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is $1.13 per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Lilly’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some large-cap health care stocks worth considering per our model. These have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.27% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

2025,PFE,"Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted accelerated approval for a new indication of leukemia drug, Blincyto. With the FDA approving the latest supplemental biologics license application (sBLA), Blincyto’s label is expanded to include treatment of patients with minimal residual disease (MRD)-positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (“ALL”).With this approval, Blincyto becomes the first FDA-approved drug for the treatment of MRD in ALL patients. However, continued approval in this indication is subject to clinical benefit data from confirmatory studies.The drug is already approved for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL in the United States and Europe.Amgen’s shares are down 1.9% so far this year compared with the industry’s loss of 4.9% during the period.The approval was based on data from phase II BLAST study, evaluating Blincyto in MRD-positive ALL patients who have achieved complete hematologic remission after receiving three or more cycles of intensive chemotherapy. Data showed that the drug achieved complete MRD response (no detectable MRD) in 81% of the patients. Median hematological relapse-free survival rate for the drug was 22.3 months.We note that MRD refers to detectable cancer cells in patients who have achieved complete remission by conventional treatment methods. Hence, the treatment of MRD will help to achieve better possible clinical outcomes in patients and delaying or stopping relapse of ALL by destroying the remaining detectable traces of leukemia.Blincyto has shown an impressive growth rate of 52% in 2017, with sales reaching $175 million. Sales are expected to improve further this year due to continued demand. However, the impact of expansion of label to include treatment of MRD remains to be seen.We remind investors that Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Besponsa had received approval for the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL in August 2017 in the United States, increasing competition for Blincyto.Amgen Inc. Price  Amgen Inc. Price | Amgen Inc.

2026,PFE,"Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AERI  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 28, after market closes. Last quarter, the company reported a wider-than-expected loss.Aerie’s performance over the last four quarters has been mixed. The company incurred a narrower-than-expected loss in two of the trailing four quarters while reporting wider-than-expected loss in the remaining two, with an average negative surprise of 4.07%.Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and Consensus  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and Consensus | Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Quote Aerie’s shares have returned 18% over a year compared with the industry’s 1.1% gain.  Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that Aerie is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen, which is the case here.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +11.41%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of $1.15 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of $1.29. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Aerie has a Zacks Rank #3, which is favorable. The combination of a Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP indicates a likely positive surprise. Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision.Factors at PlayAerie’s stock received a major boost with the FDA’s approval of lead candidate, Rhopressa 0.02%. The drug can lower elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.Since Aerie did not have any approved glaucoma product in its portfolio and given the potential the market holds, the news came as a major breather for the stock. Glaucoma is one of the largest segments in the global ophthalmic market. According to the National Eye Institute, it has been estimated that more than 2.7 million individuals in the United States suffer from glaucoma. This number is expected to reach 4.3 million by 2030. The FDA approval comes two months ahead of the scheduled Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date of Feb 28, 2018.Aerie plans to employ 100 representatives by first-quarter 2018 and plans to launch the drug by mid-2018.We expect management to throw more light on the drug’s launch during the fourth-quarter call.Meanwhile, Aerie’s second product candidate, Roclatan (netarsudil/latanoprost ophthalmic solution) 0.02%/0.005% — which is a fixed dose combination of Rhopressa and Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xalatan — achieved its primary efficacy endpoint in two phase III registration trials, named Mercury 1 and Mercury 2. The candidate also achieved successful 12-month safety and efficacy results in Mercury 1. The company expects to submit its NDA for Roclatan in second-quarter 2018.Cash burn for the year is projected at $115 million, up from $120 million due to further pipeline development.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Gemphire Therapeutics (GEMP  -  Free Report) is expected to release fourth-quarter results on Mar 21.

2027,PFE,"Following the announcement of fourth-quarter of 2017 results, shares of Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc. (MNTA  -  Free Report) moved up 2.5%.The company reported earnings per share of 18 cents in the quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 6 cents. The figure, however, was down from 60 cents earned in the year-ago quarter.Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and Consensus  Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and Consensus | Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Quote Revenues in the quarter came in at $64.6 million and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $62.7 million and was up from $34.2 million in the year-ago quarter.  Momenta’s stock has gained 3.5% in the last six months as against the industry’s decline of 3.3%.Quarter in DetailMomenta’s top-line comprises product revenues of $13.4 million earned from Sandoz’s sales of Glatopa, a generic version of Copaxone (20 mg), compared with $15.8 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to inventory price adjustments owing to Mylan’s (MYL  -  Free Report) entry into the Copaxone market along with a deduction of $0.6 million for reimbursing the company’s share of Glatopa-related legal expenses to Sandoz.Collaborative research and development revenues came in at $51.2 million, up from $18.4 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was due to a revenue recognition of $50.0 million upfront payment from CSL in fourth-quarter 2017.While, research and development expenses were up to $36.1 million from $26.4 million in the year-ago quarter, general and administrative expenses decreased 13.2% to $15.8 million.OutlookMomenta expects operating expenses (excluding stock-based compensation and net of collaborative revenues) in the range of $180-$200 million in 2018. Operating expenses in first-quarter 2018 are projected around $45-$55 million.Momenta expects to generate revenues of $45 million from Mylan as upfront payment on a quarterly basis.Pipeline UpdatesMomenta announced that the FDA has finally approved Sandoz's Abbreviated New Drug Application for Glatopa 40 mg. Both companies suffered a setback with the FDA issuing a warning letter to Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) in February 2017, which is Sandoz’s contracted fill/finish manufacturing partner for Glatopa.Meanwhile, Momenta continues to progress with its other pipeline candidates. In January 2018, Momenta and Mylan announced plans to initiate a patient clinical trial of M710 — a proposed biosimilar of Eylea — in the first half of 2018. An Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application has been accepted by regulatory body.The Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for Momenta’s M923, a biosimilar version of Humira, is also ready to be filed with the FDA but the company is looking for a collaboration partner for the same.Momenta suffered another setback when the company and partner Mylan announced that M834, a proposed biosimilar for Orencia, did not meet its primary pharmacokinetic end points in a phase I study to compare the pharmacokinetics, safety and immunogenicity of M834 to Orencia in normal healthy volunteers. Hence, Momenta and partner Mylan continue to evaluate the next course of action.Momenta’s novel autoimmune portfolio includes — M230, a Selective Immunomodulator of Fc receptors (SIF3) and M281, an anti-FcRn monoclonal antibody. Momenta successfully completed a phase I single ascending dose study in healthy volunteers for M281. In January 2018, Momenta reported positive top-line data on M281 from a phase I single ascending dose (“SAD”) and multiple ascending dose (“MAD”) study of normal human volunteers. The phase I randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of M281. The candidate did not exhibit any adverse event, was well tolerated and decreased circulating IgG levels up to 89% with a mean reduction of 84% over the 98-day MAD study. In addition, the SAD portion of the study enrolled five cohorts with a total of 34 healthy adult volunteers and showed that a single dose of M281 achieved up to an 80% reduction of circulating IgG antibodies.Our TakeMomenta’s fourth-quarter results were better-than-expected driven by the receipt of an upfront payment. 2017 was challenging for the company as it faced approval delays of Glatopa 40 mg and reported disappointing results from a biosimilar candidate.While the FDA approval of Glatopa 40 mg should relieve Momenta, competition will limit market share gains. We note that Mylan has already won FDA approval for a generic version of Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA  -  Free Report) Copaxone 40 mg. Notably, this is the first generic of Copaxone that has been approved. Since Mylan was one of the first applicants to submit a substantially complete ANDA for glatiramer acetate Injection, 40 mg/mL, containing a Paragraph IV certification, the company and other first filers may be eligible for 180 days of generic drug exclusivity.Hence, we expect the company to face challenges in the market. Meanwhile, the progress of biosimilars pipeline was encouraging.Zacks RankMomenta currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2029,PFE,"The cancer/oncology space has always been keenly watched by investors interested in the pharma/biotech sector. This is because the disease is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality across the world preceded only by heart disease.Major players in this field include Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report), Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report). Cancer drugs are the most important revenue drivers for these bigwigs as well as their smaller counterparts like Clovis Oncology, Tesaro, and Puma Biotechnology among othersEvolution of the Cancer SpaceA lot of progress has been made in this area in the last few years. Companies are aiming to bring out newer and better treatments like immunotherapies, gene therapy, targeted therapy and other novel therapies.In fact, focus in this area has increased with the FDA approval of CAR-T therapies - Novartis’ Kymriah and Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) Yescarta - last year. The path-breaking immunocellular therapy is a one-time treatment that uses a patient's own T-cells to fight cancer. The acquisitions of Kite by Gilead and Juno by Celgene have led to renewed interest in this area.Interest in PARP inhibitors has also increased considerably as they could well be the next major class of therapeutics in oncology.According to IMSQuintiles, 68 new cancer drugs were approved for 22 indications from 2011 to 2016. Worldwide costs for cancer therapeutics and supportive care drugs shot up from $91 billion in 2012 to $113 billion in 2016 with the United States accounting for 46% of the costs. More than 600 molecules are in late-stage development, with the majority being targeted therapy, which attack a specific feature, or target, in cancer cells.New Cancer DrugsNew oncology brands including Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo, Merck’s Keytruda, Pfizer’s Ibrance and AbbVie/J&J’s Imbruvica are fast catching up  and giving tough competition to category stalwarts such as Avastin, Herceptin, and Rituxan. New cancer drugs approved last year include Pfizer/Merck KGaA’s Bavencio for bladder cancer, Eli Lilly’s Verzenio, Novartis’ Kisqali, Puma Biotechnology’s Nerlynx for breast cancer and Tesaro’s Zejula for ovarian cancer.The most common indications for new drugs are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, melanoma, and breast cancer.Is the Patient Population Benefiting?It goes without saying that these new drugs bring in millions of bucks for the companies as these are sold for a huge amount of money. However, are these doing enough to cure patients or help them live longer or better? Are these relieving them of pain or fatigue, considering the fact that these come at a premium?While the FDA has approved a number of oncology drugs in recent years and also lowered the bar for clinical study goals of cancer candidates, the disease still remains the top cause of death in many populations. Here’s probably why.A few of these drugs have been successful in allowing patients with limited life expectancies to live for years. However, the efficacy of several others is being questioned as they have led to only marginal benefits with not much improvement in survival or quality of life.Many drugs are being approved based on progression free survival - the amount of time the patients live without their tumors growing larger - without evidence of benefit on survival or quality of life. This is specially the case for drugs that aim to treat terminal cancers with few treatment options. However, overall survival (OS) data, once available, sometimes shows that the drug does not help people live longer.  Also, when drugs do offer survival benefits, the gains are often marginal. The risks and long-term side effects of some drugs have also been underestimated.Overall cancer survival has barely changed over the past decade, which raises concerns about the push to get more drugs approved instead of getting effective drugs approved.Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return  Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

2030,PFE,"Shares of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) decreased 1.2% at market close on Apr 17, 2018 despite beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both earnings and revenues. This was primarily due to the fact that its top- selling drug, Remicade witnessed a 17% decline in sales, owing to recent competition in the United States.The company’s revenues increased 12.9% on a year-over-year basis to $20.1 billion in first-quarter 2018 and came ahead of the consensus mark of $19.5 billion.Increase in sales was driven primarily by strong sales of cancer drugs, favorable foreign exchange trends and recent acquisition activity. In June 2017, JNJ in its biggest ever acquisition bought Swiss biopharmaceutical company, Actelion for $30 billion.Johnson & Johnson reported non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $2.06 for first-quarter 2018, up 12.6% year over year and 18.4% on a sequential basis. It beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.01.Segment Sales and OutlookThe company reported increase in sales by geographical segments. U.S. sales increased 6.1% to $10.0 billion from $9.4 billion in the year ago quarter, while International sales increased 10.9% to $10.1 billion from $8.4 billion.Moreover, on a business-segment basis, the company reported improvements in all the three segments. Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical devices revenues increased 5.3%, 19.4% and 7.5% respectively.Although the company is facing headwinds related to sales of some of its key drugs like Remicade and Zytiga, certain new drugs are expected to make up for the loss. Its blood cancer drugs Darzalex and Imbruvica delivered strong sales growth in the quarter. However, the company’s high dependence on the pharma segment is a concern, as the consumer and medical devices segment failed to register attractive growth.Although J&J still expects 2018 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $8.00-$8.20, it increased its revenue guidance to a range of $81.0-$81.8 billion from $80.6-$81.4 billion expected earlier.In the current scenario, we believe it is prudent to discuss the following ETFs that have a relatively high exposure to Johnson and Johnson (see all Health Care ETFs here).Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to healthcare stocks and tracks the Health Care Select Sector Index.

2031,PFE,"Discouraging results from a phase II study evaluating AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) promising cancer candidate rovalpituzumab tesirine or Rova-T in third-line or later small cell lung cancer (“SCLC”) grabbed headlines this week. Other news included a purchase offer for J&J’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) diabetes device unit and successful study results announced by Heron Therapeutics (HRTX  -  Free Report) and Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report).Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesAbbVie’s Rova-T Falls Short in Key Lung Cancer Study: AbbVie’s promising cancer candidate, rovalpituzumab tesirine or Rova-T fell short of expectations in a phase II TRINITY study evaluating it in third-line or later small cell lung cancer (SCLC). AbbVie said it will not seek accelerated approval of Rova-T in the third-line setting after consulting with the FDA. Rova-T was added to AbbVie’s portfolio, following the $5.8 billion acquisition of Stemcentrx in June 2016. AbbVie had significant confidence in Rova-T’s potential. The failure of TRINITY has raised skepticism on Rova-T’s potential and has brought into question the viability of the Stemcentrx deal.

The regulatory applications to add the non-metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (“CRPC”) indication to the drug’s label were based on the results of the PROSPER study on Xtandi. With the FDA granting priority review, a decision is expected in July. (Read More: Pfizer’s Xtandi Label Expansion Filing Gets Priority Review).Meanwhile, British company Reckitt Benckiser Group pulled out of the discussion with Pfizer to buy the latter’s Consumer Health segment. Last October, Pfizer had said that it was exploring strategic alternatives for its Consumer Healthcare segment including a partial or a full separation through a spin-off, sale or other transaction. A decision regarding the same is expected to be made this year and it may ultimately opt to retain the business. Glaxo also said it has withdrawn from the race to buy Pfizer’s unit.Heron’s HTX-011 Succeeds in Phase III: Heron Therapeutics’ pipeline candidate, HTX-011 met the primary endpoint in two pivotal phase III studies, evaluating it in post-operative pain control, following bunionectomy and hernia repair, respectively. Top-line data from both the studies showed that treatment with HTX-011 led to statistically significant reductions in pain intensity and opoid use through 72 hours following surgery. The candidate was also superior to bupivacaine solution, which is the current standard-of care local anesthetic for postoperative pain control.

2033,PFE,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that a phase III study evaluating its pipeline candidate tafamidis for the treatment of transthyretin cardiomyopathy (TTR-CM) met its primary endpoint.Top line data from the ATTR-ACT study showed that treatment with tafamidis led to a statistically significant reduction in the combination of all-cause mortality and frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations – the primary endpoint - compared with the placebo at 30 months. The safety data also demonstrated that tafamidis was generally well tolerated by patients.After Pfizer revealed strong late-stage results from the tafamidis study, shares of Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY  -  Free Report) and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS  -  Free Report) declined more than 8% and 4%, respectively, on Friday. Both these biotechs have made competing drugs to tafamidis.TTR-CM is a rare disease associated with progressive heart failure and is universally fatal. Presently, no treatment is approved to treat this fatal disease. According to Pfizer’s press release, less than 1% of people with the disease are diagnosed with life expectancy averaging three to five years from diagnosis.There are two types of TTR-CM, a hereditary form and a wild-type form of the disease, which is not hereditary. The ATTR-ACT study included both types of patients. However, Alnylam and Ionis have developed their candidates, patisiran and inotersen, respectively, for hereditary TTR amyloidosis, or hATTR. Both patisiran and inotersen are under review in the EU and United States and could be launched this year.Tafamidis has been granted fast track status by FDA for TTR-CM. Meanwhile, tafamidis also enjoys orphan drug designation for TTR-CM in both the EU and United States.Tafamidis is already approved for the treatment of transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP) in 40 countries except United States. In the United States, Pfizer received a complete response letter (CRL) from the FDA on for TTR-FAP in 2012.Shares of Pfizer have declined 1.1% so far this year, comparing favorably with a 2.7% decrease for the industry.Zacks Rank & Key PickPfizer carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2034,PFE,"U.S. equity markets are going through a rough patch. There is a lot of uncertainty around trade negotiations and recent concerns around Facebook’s data breach are weighing on the tech sector. This has increased the appeal of dividend investing (read: Stocks and ETFs with Juicy Dividend Yields).What’s Bothering the Markets?Tech’s FreefallA day after recording massive gains on talks of negotiations between China and the United States relating to trade, the markets suffered huge losses led by tech stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.4%. Moreover, Standard & Poor's 500 fell 1.7% and the technology heavy Nasdaq slid 2.9%, as investors flocked to safety.Social media companies were the major losers, as the recent data debacle introduced fresh concerns around the activities of sector participants. Twitter Inc (TWTR  -  Free Report) slumped 12% at the end of trading on Mar 27, as Citron Research said it is shorting the stock owing to the company’s reliance on licensing user data. Moreover, Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) slumped a further 4.9% as Mark Zuckerberg prepares to testify in front of Congress.Facebook has been falling, following a report that data mining firm Cambridge Analytica, the firm that worked for President Trump’s campaign, unethically obtained data from around 50 million Facebook users without their permission. ""While this will not be a pleasant experience for Zuckerberg and his team going in front of Congress, it is a necessary smart strategic step for Facebook to head to the Beltway as the public fury continues to grow around the Cambridge data leak,"" per a CNBC article citing Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights.Trade Uncertainty and GeopoliticsAlthough tensions between Washington and Beijing are easing, with signs of negotiations between China and the United States relating to trade, it will be naive to sit back, relax and hope that the negotiations won’t have a major impact on the global financial markets. Owing to the recent volatility in the markets, allocating a portion of your portfolio to safe dividend funds seems like an appealing option (read: ETFs to Buy as Trade War Fears Abate).Moreover, investors expect the United States to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, after John Bolton was appointed as national security adviser. This could bring back sanctions on Iran and weigh on its capability to export crude oil to the market. As a result, rising geopolitical risks might increase the appeal of dividend investing.  In such a scenario, dividend-paying securities provide consistent income to investors. The uniqueness of these securities is their increased returns when political uncertainty weighs on markets, more so because apart from high dividend, these securities exhibit less volatility as they are stable and mature companies.Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to U.S. equities with relatively high dividend yields.FlexShares Quality Dividend Index Fund QDFThis fund seeks to provide exposure to U.S. companies providing high dividends, while maintaining a quality factor and utilizing constraints to minimize risk.It has AUM of $1.8 billion and charges a fee of 37 basis points a year.

2035,PFE,"The big recession 10 years ago was triggered by sub-prime lending in the United States. It was the worst economic slowdown since the Great Depression of 1929. In a span of 80 years, from the beginning of the Great Depression to the end of the financial crisis in 2009, there have been 14 small or big recessions that have hit the U.S. economy. With nearly a decade gone by since the last recession, some analysts expect another recession to be round the corner.The last recession was a pretty costly one with the U.S. government spending nearly $350 billion to bail out big banks. It also announced a $787 billion economic stimulus package through which the government pumped money directly into the economy. The housing market was most affected with prices crashing more than 30% and unemployment rate in high single digits.Based on historic patterns and a few economic factors like low unemployment rate and hiking of rates by the Fed, some analysts believe that a recession may hit the market. However, predicting a recession is difficult as it depends on several factors. Although housing prices have moderated in several key areas, job growth in the United States remains decent, giving a mixed picture of the economy.An article published on the website wtop.com in December last year indicated that yield on short-term bonds was close to that of long-term bonds. This is termed as a flattening yield curve. This indicates that investors are wary of long-term economic growth. However, some suggest that the recent rate hike has caused short-term yields to rise. Continued demand for long-term U.S. bonds (due to lower bond rates in the Europe and Japan) is keeping yields lower.Views on the equity market are also mixed. Equity markets are growing buoyed by solid earnings but at the same time volatility is rising too. Earnings are expected to increase on the back of the tax cut announced last year instead of rising revenues. This means that the actual growth of the economy will be lesser than portrayed by market performance.Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund has predicted that the U.S. economy is heading for a recession as soon as 2020, as published in a blog on express.co.uk. However, it expects a mild recession. Moreover, per a blog published on fortune.com, Bill Gates and famed investor, Warren Buffett also believe that a recession is certain. However, they are unsure about the timeline.We conclude that the economy is going through a mixed phase. Hence, it is uncertain when it will start slipping into recession. However, the impact of a recession will be hard to deal with.Historically, it has been seen that Consumer Staples and Pharmaceuticals industries are recession proof as these industries manufacture necessary items. Hence, we believe that investors should pick stocks from these industries to avoid a potential setback to their portfolio during a financial crisis.Here we present some of the best stocks from these industries. These stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) and hold a VGM Score of A or B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. With our Style Score system, we have identified stocks that have the potential to beat the market.The score allows one to streamline their search to select winners by eliminating the negative aspects. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score. Our research shows that stocks with an impressive VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Further, these stocks have been witnessing positive interest from analysts lately and belong to industries that rank roughly in the top half, per the Zacks Industry Rank system.

2038,PFE,"The FDA has proposed new guidelines, which are aimed at lowering the clinical study goals of Alzheimer’s disease drugs for treating earlier-stage patients who have not yet displayed functional disability or clinical abnormality. This strategy, part of FDA’s ongoing efforts to expand access to safe and effective treatment options for many serious conditions, suggests that the agency may be open to an accelerated approval process for such drugs.FDA’s proposed guidelines came in a week when major disappointments in the field were announced by companies developing drugs to treat this deadly brain disease.Earlier this week, Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that it is discontinuing another study evaluating verubecestat for the treatment of prodromal Alzheimer’s disease as its success was unlikely.Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) also announced that it has decided to increase the number of patients (enrolment) in studies being conducted on its crucial Alzheimer’s disease candidate, aducanumab, which raised concerns regarding the chances of success of the treatment. In December 2017, Biogen’s Alzheimer’s disease study on another candidate, BAN2401 failed to show early positive results, which raised investor concern about the candidate’s chances of success.The Alzheimer’s disease market has attracted a lot of attention from several companies. However, the successful development of therapies for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease is challenging.This may be somewhat because the underlying causes of severe neurological ailments like Alzheimer’s may not be as clear as diseases like cancer. Also, Alzheimer’s  progress may go unnoticed for years. By the time, the symptoms of the ailment become evident, significant function may already be lost, which makes developing drugs to treat this disease difficult.We note that several companies have failed in this regard.Last month, Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) reportedly announced the termination of its R&D efforts in the Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease areas, which will result in about 300 layoffs. Long back, Pfizer shelved its late-stage Alzheimer’s candidate, bapineuzumab IV after it failed two phase III studies.In November 2016, Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) anti-amyloid candidate solanezumab failed to meet the primary endpoint in a late-stage AD study. Lilly decided to drop the development of solanezumab. Lilly also suffered a major setback in August 2010, when it had to halt the development of another phase III Alzheimer’s candidate, semagacestat.The Alzheimer’s disease market represents huge commercial potential and a successfully developed product could generate billions of dollars in sales once launched.FDA’s latest effort may reinvigorate research efforts for Alzheimer’s drugs after repeated failures.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2039,PFE,"Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report) announced encouraging results from a phase II investigator-sponsored trial (“IST”) of cabozantinib for the first-line treatment of metastatic radioiodine (“RAI”)-refractory differentiated thyroid carcinoma (“DTC”).The trial is being conducted by the Center for Rare Cancers and Personalized Therapy at the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania. Enrollment for the trial was completed in August 2017.Patients who were enrolled in this single-arm, open-label trial, were administered oral cabozantinib 60 mg, once daily.  The trial enrolled metastatic, RAI-refractory DTC patients.The primary endpoint of the trial is objective response rate. Partial response was achieved by 54% of patients (n=19), and stable disease was reported in 43% of patients (n=15) per RECIST 1.1.However, one evaluated patient experienced a decrease in tumor target lesions. Secondary endpoints of the trial include progression-free survival (“PFS”), time to progression (“TTP”), duration of response and clinical benefit rate (“CBR”) defined as the number of patients achieving an objective response or stable disease for at least six months.  The CBR at six months was 80% (n=28). With a median follow up for the study of 35 weeks the median PFS has not been reached. The median TTP among those patients who progressed was 35 weeks.Exelixis plans to initiate a pivotal phase III study on cabozantinib in patients with advanced DTC later in 2018 based on the abovementioned results and data from other studies of cabozantinib in previously treated DTC.  Exelixis’ stock has rallied 30.3% over a year against the industry’’s decline of 4.2%.We note that Exelixis’ lead product, Cometriq, the capsule form of cabozantinib, was approved in the United States in 2012 for the treatment of progressive, metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (“MTC”).In April 2016, a tablet formulation of cabozantinib, Cabometyx was approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”) who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy. The recent FDA approval of Cabometyx for the treatment of previously untreated advanced RCC should further boost demand. The drug demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS versus the current standard of care, Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Sutent.Meanwhile, Exelixis is developing cabozantinib in a broad development program comprising over 45 clinical studies across multiple indications. The CELESTIAL study for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma is also ongoing.  Exelixis also announced collaboration agreements with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) and Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) for the development of cabozantinib in combination with immunotherapy agents in early 2017.Zacks RankExelixis carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more.

2040,PFE,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced a positive outcome from FDA Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee (GIDAC) meeting that discussed the company’s supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) looking for label expansion of Xeljanz (tofacitinib).Pfizer is seeking to get Xeljanz approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC). Xeljanz, a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, is already approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis and active psoriatic arthritis. The supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Xeljanz is currently under review by the FDA.Shares of Pfizer are up 7.2% in the past year, compared with a 9.2% increase for the industry it belongs to.The GIDAC gave its vote on two voting questions related to the use of the 10 mg twice-daily (BID) dose beyond the eight week induction period. The sNDA included proposed dosing regimen of Xeljanz 10 mg  twice daily (BID) for eight weeks of induction followed by a dose of 5 mg BID for maintenance. It also proposed an extension of the use of tofacitinib 10 mg BID from eight to 16 weeks of induction in adult patients who have not achieved adequate therapeutic benefit by Week 8 and also 10 mg BID for maintenance therapy in patients with an inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance to TNF blocker therapy. The 10 mg BID voted unanimously (15-0) for both the proposals. However, the Committee voted 8-7 against conducting a post-marketing efficacy study comparing a tofacitinib 10 mg BID continuous dosing regimen with a regimen of tofacitinib 10 mg BID induction and 5 mg BID as maintenance in the UC population. .The recommendations given by the GIDAC are not binding. The FDA’s decision on whether or not to approve tofacitinib for UC is expected in June 2018.Pfizer Inc. Price  Pfizer Inc. Price | Pfizer Inc.

2041,PFE,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that it is discontinuing another study evaluating verubecestat for the treatment of prodromal Alzheimer’s disease as its success was unlikely.APECS was a phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of verubecestat, an oral β-amyloid precursor protein site-cleaving enzyme (BACE) inhibitor, versus placebo.The study was stopped on the recommendation of an external data monitoring committee, which assessed the study’s overall benefit/risk during a recent interim safety analysis. The committee said that the chances of observing positive risk/benefit profile in the study, if it continued, were slim.Shares of Merck declined almost 1% on Tuesday. In the past year, Merck’s shares have underperformed the industry. Merck’s shares have declined 15.8% in the period against a 10% increase for the industry.In February last year, Merck had discontinued another study, EPOCH (phase II/III), on verubecestat, which was evaluating it for mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease due to lack of efficacy.

2042,PFE,"The markets have been extremely volatile lately owing to a multitude of factors including rate hikes fears and risks of a potential trade war. One particular segment of the market, which has been attracting investor attention over the last few years, is the socially responsible investing segment. These ETFs allow you to invest in line with your principles and contribute to making the world a better place in your own small way (read: ETFs to be Impacted by Potential Trade War With China).Investing in separate stocks that you feel are commensurate with your principles can be difficult, while also maintaining a diversified portfolio. Here, ETFs come to the rescue, as they offer a diversified portfolio of stocks focusing on particular screens for environmental, social or governance (ESG) related issues.Gender equality has been the top trend in 2017 and 2018 so far. With increased focus on disparities in the pay of men and women, investing in companies that have a better standing with regards to gender equity has been gaining popularity. For instance, HSBC revealed a 59% gender pay gap, even though HSBC’s UK workforce comprises 54% women. Moreover, a mere 23% occupy senior roles at the bank.Another area attracting investor attention is clean energy. After President Donald Trump decided to leave the Paris Climate Accord last year, multiple critics have argued the need to shift toward cleaner energy and reduce fossil fuel consumption. There are multiple ways to gain exposure to this principle, either by investing directly in funds having a portfolio of stocks involved in clean energy, or by investing in funds having a portfolio of stocks trying to save energy and reduce carbon emissions in their day-to- day operations.The latest trend among sustainable investing enthusiasts is the need to steer clear of weapons companies. After the school shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School in February and the incident in Las Vegas music festival in 2017, arguments for gun laws and imposing stricter rules regarding gun sales have panned up. Therefore, funds that refrain from investing in companies involved in weapons have caught investor attention.   In the current scenario, we believe it is prudent to discuss the following ETFs that focus on providing exposure to sustainable investing themes.  iShares MSCI KLD 400 Social ETF (DSI  -  Free Report)This ETF offers exposure to stocks that exhibit positive ESG characteristics, refraining from investing in companies involved in weapons, tobacco or alcohol.

2044,PFE,"GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) focuses on three core businesses – Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare. Glaxo enjoys strong fundamentals in the form of its diversified base and presence in different geographical areas.This UK-based company reshaped its business, following the completion of the three-part, inter-conditional transaction with Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) in March 2015. Under the deal, Glaxo sold its oncology assets to Novartis and acquired Novartis’ Vaccines business (excluding influenza vaccines).Here are four reasons why you should invest in the stock this year.Good Rank and Solid VGM Score: Glaxo carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a favorable VGM Score of A. Back-tested results show that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2, offer the best upside potential. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Rising Share Price and Estimates: After underperforming the broader industry in 2017, Glaxo’s shares have picked up this year. Glaxo’s stock has risen 5.4% this year so far, which compares favorably with a flat trajectory for the industry.Meanwhile, estimates for 2018 and 2019 rose 1.4% and 1.7%, respectively in the past 30 days.This pharma giant has been consistently beating earnings expectations. Its earnings surpassed expectations in three of the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 2.12%.New Drugs/Vaccines Doing Well: Glaxo’s newer respiratory/HIV drugs and vaccines are all doing well and will continue to boost revenues. These new products generated 22% of Glaxo’s Pharmaceuticals and Vaccine sales in 2016 and 30% in 2017 and should continue to boost revenues significantly.Glaxo had expected the new pharmaceutical and vaccine products including contributions from Shingrix to deliver sales of £6 billion per annum by 2020.  However, these products almost reached the £6 billion target in 2017.Significant Progress with Pipeline: Glaxo has made significant progress with its late-stage pipeline. In 2017, Glaxo received approvals for three key new drugs, Shingrix vaccine for shingles, which enjoys preferential recommendation from ACIP; Trelegy Ellipta, which provides three medicines in a single inhaler to treat COPD and Juluca (dolutegravir and rilpivirine), the first 2-drug regimen, once-daily, single pill for HIV.  Back-to-back approvals of three new products have strengthened Glaxo’s competitive position.Juluca has been developed by Glaxo and partner Pfizer, Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) HIV-focused company, ViiV Healthcare, in partnership with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report).Glaxo is also working on expanding the label of marketed products like Nucala into additional indicationsConclusionGlaxo faces its share of challenges like stiff competition, genericization and pricing pressure along with slowing growth in emerging markets.Meanwhile, its top-selling respiratory product, Advair is also expected to face generic competition in the United States this year, which will hurt sales.However, it looks like Glaxo’s strong pipeline, consistent outperformance of new HIV drugs and vaccines, three new products, and cost cuts can bring it back on track this year.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio? Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

2045,PFE,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) and its Japanese partner Astellas announced that the FDA has granted priority review to a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for prostate cancer drug, Xtandi. Pfizer is looking to expand the label of Xtandi to include an early-stage patient population. With the FDA granting priority review, a decision is expected in July.Pfizer also said that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has validated a similar label expansion application in Europe.Shares of Pfizer have returned 1.2% so far this year, almost in line with a 1.3% increase for the industry.The regulatory applications to add the non-metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (“CRPC”) indication to the drug’s label were based on the results of thePROSPER study on Xtandi.Detailed data from the phase III PROSPER study on Xtandi showed that treatment with the combination of Xtandi (enzalutamide) and androgen deprivation therapy (“ADT”) reduced the risk of metastases or death by 71% compared with ADT alone in men with non-metastatic CRPC.In the double-blind study, the median metastasis-free survival (MFS) — the primary endpoint — was 36.6 months with Xtandi plus ADT versus 14.7 months with ADT alone. We remind investors that top-line data from the PROSPER study was presented by Pfizer/Astellas in September 2017.Many prostate cancer patients with non-metastatic CRPC — an earlier stage of prostate cancer — can experience disease progression despite ADT. However, presently no FDA approved treatment options are available to cater to this until these patients develop metastatic disease i.e. the cancer spreads to other parts of the body.Xtandi is presently approved for the treatment of metastatic CRPC in patients who have previously received docetaxel. If approved for the non-metastatic patient population, the label of Xtandi can be expanded to cover all patients with CRPC.Xtandi was added to Pfizer’s portfolio with the acquisition of Medivation in September 2017. While Pfizer sells Xtandi in the United States in partnership with Astellas, the latter owns the marketing right outside the U.S. markets. Pfizer recorded Xtandi alliance revenues of $590 million in 2017.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderPfizer carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2047,PFE,"AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) announced that it has secured an FDA approval for the label expansion of its marketed drug, Tagrisso (osimertinib), for first-line treatment of adult patients with locally-advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have EGFR mutations.Notably, Tagrisso is approved in the United States, European Union, Japan and China as second-line treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC, who showed progress following treatment with an EGFR TKI due to the EGFR T790M resistance mutation.Shares of AstraZeneca have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has gained 3.7% versus the industry’s decline of 3.3%. We remind investors that last December, the FDA accepted and granted a priority review to the company’s supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Tagrisso for the aforementioned indication.The FDA nod was based on positive data from the phase III FLAURA study, which compared Tagrisso with the standard-of-care EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in the first-line lung cancer setting.Data from the trial showed that the chance of progression or death risk was reduced by more than half in the Tagrisso arm compared with the commonly-used EGFR inhibitors. The median progression-free survival was 18.9 months for patients on Tagrisso compared with 10.2 months in the comparator arm. Tagrisso was well-tolerated in the trial with a safety profile, consistent with the previous experience.Importantly, a similar application for Tagrisso’s label expansion is under review in the EU as well as Japan with a decision expected in the second half of 2018.Tagrisso registered sales of $955 million in 2017, reflecting growth of 126% from the year-ago period and accounting for 5% of total sales. A potential approval in the first-line setting will further boost the drug’s prospects. However, the lung cancer market is crowded with several companies developing or marketing treatments. While Roche Holding AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) /Astellas’ Tarceva is approved for treating NSCLC, Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) is developing its drug Dacomitinib in a phase III study as a first-line treatment for the indication. Moreover, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) is developing Opdivo as a treatment for NSCLC and AstraZeneca too has Iressa approved for treating NSCLC and is also developing Imfinzi for the same indication.AstraZeneca PLC Price AstraZeneca PLC Price | AstraZeneca PLC Quote Zacks RankAstraZeneca carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2048,PFE,"U.S. equity markets are facing widespread volatility, thanks to trade negotiations and recent geopolitical risks owing to the U.S. strike on Syrian chemical facilities.  Although the markets shrugged off fears stemming from the Syria attack and proposed sanctions on Russia as the earnings season is underway, the long-term impact of such factors might increase the appeal of dividend investing (read: Stocks and ETFs with Juicy Dividend Yields). Into the Headlines Market turbulence has brought portfolio reallocation back into play. Tensions between Washington and Beijing have been bothering the markets for quite some time now. Although talks of negotiations have been doing the rounds, nothing can be said for certain. To sail through market volatility, allocating a portion of your portfolio to safe dividend funds seems like a judicious option (read: ETFs to Buy as Trade War Fears Abate). Moreover, the recent chemical attack in Syria has increased tensions pertaining to U.S.-Russia relations. The recent missile strikes on Syrian chemical plants by a U.S.-led coalition with France and U.K. has complicated the situation. Anatoly Antonov, Russia’s ambassador to the United States, told the Wall Street Journal, “We warned that such actions will not be left without consequences. All responsibility for them rests with Washington, London and Paris. Insulting the president of Russia is unacceptable and inadmissible.” In the event of a response by Russia, Iran or Syria, the markets might take a hit on actual war concerns, instead of only a trade war. Although the odds of that happening are low, it is advisable to safeguard one’s portfolio against such severe events. This is because during such volatile times, it is difficult to beat algorithmic trading outlets, which are programmed to start selling by merely reading news headlines indicating at an adverse event.  Moving on to interest rate, the CME Fed watch tool currently forecasts two more rate hikes in 2018, which many analysts believe has already been priced in by the Wall Street. In such a scenario, dividend-paying securities provide consistent income to investors. The uniqueness of these securities is their increased returns when political uncertainty weighs on markets, more so because apart from high dividend, these securities exhibit low volatility as they are stable and mature companies. Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to U.S. equities with relatively high dividend yields. Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG  -  Free Report) This fund seeks to provide exposure to U.S. companies offering high dividends.  It has AUM of $27.3 billion and charges a fee of 8 basis points a year. From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Industrials, Consumer Services and Health Care with 33.2%, 19.0% and 12.0% allocation, respectively. The fund’s top three holdings are Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT  -  Free Report) with 4.0%, 4.0% and 3.9% allocation, respectively. The fund has returned 17.4% in a year and 0.5% year to date. It has a dividend yield of 1.87% and has garnered $241.1 million in inflows in the first two weeks of April, per etf.com data. Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM  -  Free Report) This fund seeks to provide exposure to large, established U.S. companies providing high dividends.  It has AUM of $20.6 billion and charges a fee of 8 basis points a year. From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Information Technology, Financials and Health Care with 17.0%, 14.2% and 12.9% allocation, respectively. The fund’s top three holdings are Microsoft Corp, JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM  -  Free Report) and Johnson & Johnson, with 7.0%, 3.9% and 3.5% allocation, respectively. It has returned 12.9% in a year but has lost 1.3% year to date. It has a dividend yield of 2.94% and has garnered $123.6 million in inflows in the first two weeks of April, per etf.com data.  Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD  -  Free Report) This fund seeks to provide cheap exposure to U.S. companies paying out high dividends.  It has AUM of $7.4 billion and charges a fee of 7 basis points a year. From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Consumer Staples, Information Technology and Industrials with 21.9%, 21.7% and 15.1% allocation, respectively. The fund’s top three holdings are Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM  -  Free Report), Intel Corp (INTC  -  Free Report) and Pfizer Inc (PFE  -  Free Report) with 4.8%, 4.6% and 4.6% allocation respectively.

2049,PFE,"The first-quarter earnings season has just kicked off. Per the latest Earnings Preview, the bottom line of S&P 500 companies is expected to increase at a highly impressive rate of 16.6% on a year-over-year basis. This prospective upside marks the maximum quarterly earnings growth pace in seven years. The report further predicts that 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors are projected to exhibit double-digit earnings growth in the to-be-reported quarter. Total revenues for the same set of companies are projected to grow 7.5%.However, focusing our attention on the Large Cap Pharma and Medical-Drugs sector, we note that both these sectors have decreased 6.2% and 4.2%, respectively, since February this year due to broader market pressure. Further, the S&P 500 index has registered a decline of 6.2% since the second month of 2018.We remind investors that the U.S. stock market is facing a severe volatility since the last couple of months despite a strong start this year. This downside can mainly be attributable to a potentially damaging trade war between the world’s two largest economies, United States and China, since this February.After President Donald Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of annual Chinese imports, China retaliated by notifying its intention to levy tariffs on 128 U.S. products. Such aggressive exchange has triggered tensions of a possible trade dispute between the two countries. Moreover, sluggish large-cap tech stocks are cited as another reason for this plummet in the market.Despite the recent market unrest, an optimistic sentiment revolves around the remaining year. Notably, the biotech sector is likely to improve as the year advances. We expect new product sales to thrive in tandem with rising demand. This apart, a successful innovation and a host of product launches, strong clinical study outcomes, more frequent FDA nods, solid performance of key products, growing demand for drugs, especially to deal with rare-to-treat diseases, an ageing population and an escalated healthcare expenditure are some of the factors to keep the sector stable. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.It is important to note that the outlook for the upcoming first-quarter results looks bright. Per the Earnings Preview, the broader Medical sector (inclusive of drug, biotech as well as Medical Device companies) is expected to record 6.3% year-over-year growth in revenues and a 7.8% rise in earnings.How to Pick Potential Q1 WinnersGiven the enormity of the healthcare space, the task of selecting stocks with possibilities to beat estimates could appear quite daunting. But the Zacks proprietary methodology makes this job fairly simple. One way to carve out the top choices this reporting cycle is by looking at the stocks with the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP. It is observed that a positive earnings surprise delivered by a company mostly leads to its stock price appreciation.Per the well-researched quantitative model, an Earnings ESP is used for identifying stocks with higher or 70% chances of pulling off a positive surprise in the impending earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Per our proven methodology, we culled three stocks from large-cap pharma and two from the medical-drug sector, poised to surpass estimates in the to-be-reported quarter.The three large cap stocks are as follows:Our first pick is AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report). This North Chicago, IL-based company has an Earnings ESP of +0.24% and a Zacks Rank #3. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2018 earnings being pegged at $1.78 per share. Besides this, the company boasts an encouraging earnings track record, exceeding expectations in all the last four quarters with an average beat of 1.81%. AbbVie is scheduled to report earnings numbers on Apr 26.Our next choice is Eli Lilly & Company (LLY  -  Free Report). The stock has an Earnings ESP of +0.73% and a Zacks Rank #2. The consensus mark for first-quarter earnings stands at $1.13 per share. Headquartered in Indianapolis, IN, Lilly has an excellent positive earnings surprise history. The company’s average beat over the trailing four quarters is 4.08%. Lilly is slated to announce results on Apr 24.Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) too has a pleasing earnings profile with the company having consistently outpaced expectations in all the last four quarters with an average beat of 4.97%. It looks perfectly poised to repeat this winning streak this time around as well. This New York-based player is Zacks #2 Ranked and has an Earnings ESP of +2.62%. The consensus mark for first-quarter bottom line is pegged at 73 cents per share. Pfizer is scheduled to release financial figures on May 1.Given below are the two medical-drug stocks:Our first pick from the medical-drug sector is Catalent, Inc. (CTLT  -  Free Report). This New Jersey-based company has an Earnings ESP of +1.70% and a Zacks Rank of 3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at 39 cents per share. The company flaunts a positive earnings surprise record, outshining expectations in all the last four quarters with an average beat of 16.44%. Catalent is expected to report earnings on May 3.Our next choice is Aratana Therapeutics, Inc. (PETX  -  Free Report). The stock has an Earnings ESP of +37.14% and is a #3 Ranked player. The consensus mark for first-quarter loss stands at 18 cents per share. Based in Kansas, Aratana has an outstanding earnings history with consecutive estimate beats in the trailing four quarters, the average being 11.74%.

2050,PFE,"Last week, U.S. Senator Tina Smith expressed concerns that big pharma companies plan to use their large corporate tax savings to reward shareholders instead of bringing down costs of expensive drugs and benefiting consumers. The Senator questioned through letters to CEOs of five big pharma companies — Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) and Abbott Labs (ABT  -  Free Report) — how they plan to use their extra cash.Please note that on their Q4 conference calls held earlier this year, most big pharma companies discussed what they plan to do with the extra cash they save from the new tax bill. These companies plan to invest the extra cash in capital expenditures, products/pipeline, in-licensing or acquisition deals or rewarding shareholders through higher dividends and share buybacks. Not many talked about taking any steps to lower prescription drug costs.This apart, key announcements this week included the failure of Dermira, Inc.’s (DERM  -  Free Report) acne candidate in two pivotal late-stage studies, Merck’s oncology collaboration with Japan’s Eisai, expansion of Jardiance clinical studies by Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and FDA committee backing for Pfizer’s Xeljanz for the third indication.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesDermira Shares Sink as Acne Candidate Fails: Shares of Dermira plunged after it announced that its acne candidate, olumacostat glasaretil, surprisingly failed to meet the primary endpoint in either of the two pivotal phase III studies -- CLAREOS-1 and CLAREOS-2. The company said that it will likely stop olumacostat glasaretil’s development following this failure. (Read More: Dermira's Acne Candidate Fails in Pivotal Trials, Shares Sink)Merck to Jointly Develop Eisai’s Cancer Drug Lenvima: Similar to last year’s profit sharing deal with AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report), Merck announced an oncology collaboration with Japan’s Eisai Co., Ltd. Per this deal, the companies will jointly develop and commercialize Eisai’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Lenvima, both as a monotherapy and in combination with Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda for several types of cancer. For the deal, Merck will give Eisai an upfront payment of $300 million. The companies will share global development and marketing costs as well as gross profits from Lenvima equally. (Read More: Merck to Pay $300M Upfront to Co-Develop Eisai's Cancer Drug)Pfizer’s Xeljanz sNDA Gets FDA Committee Backing: Pfizer’s supplemental new drug application to include the ulcerative colitis (UC) indication in its label received a backing from an FDA advisory committee. The FDA’s Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee (GIDAC) voted unanimously in favor of the JAK inhibitor. The FDA’s decision is expected in June. Xeljanz, which is already approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis and active psoriatic arthritis, recorded sales of $1.35 billion in 2017, representing growth of 45% year over year.AstraZeneca Looks for Forxiga EU Approval in Type I Diabetes: AstraZeneca’s application looking to get its SGLT-2 inhibitor, Forxiga, approved for a new indication -- an oral adjunct treatment to insulin in type-1 diabetes (T1D) patients -- was accepted by the European Medicines Agency. Forxiga is presently approved as a monotherapy as well as a combination therapy to treat type-2 diabetes. If approved, Forxiga will become the first SGLT-2 inhibitor approved in Europe for the treatment of T1D as an oral treatment adjunct to insulin. (Read More: AstraZeneca's Forxiga Label Expansion Filing Accepted in EU)Glaxo Presents Asthma/HIV Data: Glaxo (GSK  -  Free Report) presented data from OSMO study on a new respiratory medicine, Nucala, at American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) and World Allergy Organization (WAO) Joint Congress in Orlando. Data from the study showed that patients whose asthma was uncontrolled with Xolair witnessed improved asthma control on switching to Glaxo’s new respiratory medicine, Nucala.Glaxo also presented interim data from a phase IIIb study, INSPIRING, on investigational HIV candidate dolutegravir at a medical conference in Boston. (Read More: Glaxo’s Encouraging Asthma & HIV Data at Medical Meetings)Meanwhile, Glaxo gained approval to expand the European label of its once-daily LABA/ICS combination treatment, Relvar Ellipta. Now, Relvar Ellipta can be used in the EU in patients whose asthma is already adequately controlled by an ICS/LABA. With the label update, doctors can prescribe asthma patients to switch to once-daily Relvar Ellipta from their current twice-daily ICS/LABA, while experiencing comparable benefit in lung function and safety profile.Lilly, Boehringer to Expand Jardiance Clinical Studies: Lilly and partner Boehringer Ingelheim announced plans to initiate two phase III EMPERIAL studies, which will evaluate the effect of Lilly’s SGLT2 inhibitor Jardiance on exercise ability and heart failure symptoms in people with chronic heart failure irrespective of whether they have type II diabetes. Though the presently ongoing phase III EMPEROR outcomes studies are evaluating the effect of Jardiance on long-term morbidity and mortality outcomes in people with heart failure, the EMPERIAL studies will investigate if treatment with Jardiance can help improve the everyday lives of people living with chronic heart failure.

2051,PFE,"With the passing of the new tax bill, the corporate tax rate has come down from 35% to 21% which is likely to boosts profit margins. Moreover, the cash repatriation window allowed in the bill will help companies to bring in cash stashed in foreign locations at a one-time tax rate of 10%, leaving these companies with extra spending power.Most big pharma companies discussed their plans to use the extra cash they save from the new tax bill at their fourth-quarter conference calls. The extra cash will mostly be invested in capital expenditures, products/pipeline, in-licensing or acquisition deals or rewarding shareholders through higher dividends and share buybacks. However, the majority of companies did not mention any effort regarding lowering of prescription drug costs.Last week, Senator Tina Smith in letters to five big pharma companies, expressed concern about how big pharma companies plan to used billions of dollars they will save from the tax cut offered under the tax bill passed in December 2017. She is concerned about the fact that the companies are favoring investors instead of using the savings to bring down prescription drug costs. Major life-saving drugs which are protected by patents are steeply priced. Thus, making these drugs affordable will help consumers, as it will lower their medical costs.The Senator has sent letters to CEOs of Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report), Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) to provide the details of how they intend to utilize major savings from the tax overhaul.The prices of major prescription drugs have skyrocketed over the past years, pinching hard U.S. citizens as their medical bills have soared. Moreover, the government also has to pay higher costs for the drugs that are covered under Medicare. The concern of the senator is thus justified. A move to restrict the use of tax savings for boosting shareholders will be a welcome move for consumers.Moreover, large players from every other industry have similar plans, which have undercut President Donald Trump’s plans to create jobs and boost wages.Senator Smith is also working toward making cheaper generic drugs available in the market faster by introducing a new legislation, as reported by KDAL.Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return  Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnDon’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more.

2052,PFE,"“When you combine ignorance and leverage, you get some pretty interesting results.” – Warren BuffettIndeed, in the complex world of investment, understanding the amount of financial leverage a company bears is crucial. Per the theory of cost of capital, a company’s capital structure reflects a mix of debt and equity that is used to finance its capital projects. Now a comparative analysis of the same theory reveals that most companies prefer debt financing over equity since debt is cheaper, especially in periods of low interest rates.Moreover, when a company opts for equity financing, a shareholder not only becomes a partial owner of the company but develops a direct claim on the company’s future profits as well. Another perk of debt financing is that the interest on debt is tax deductible.However, given the uncertainty surrounding the economy in recent times, no one can be fully sure of how a company will perform the next day. Companies bearing large amount of debts are more prone to financial crisis, especially at times of high interest rates.With the Federal Reserve set to raise interest rates for the United States thrice in 2018, the market scenario does not seem to be much in favor of companies opting for debt financing. That said, for the investor, the real challenge is determining whether the stock in which he/she is investing has a sustainable debt level, since a debt-free corporation is rare to find. This is where the concept of “leverage” comes in. Leverage simply indicates the level of debt a corporation carries at present. Historically, several leverage ratios have emerged as efficient tools to evaluate a company’s credit level to support prudent equity investments. The most popular among them is debt-to-equity ratio.Analyzing Debt/EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A company with a lower debt-to-equity ratio implies that it has a more or less financially stable business, thereby making it a better investment pick.Although companies reflecting high earnings growth should be the ideal investment choices, those with high leverage might not generate satisfactory returns. So companies with low leverage instead of high earnings will be your perfect choice on Valentine's Day.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors, it is wise to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure safe returns.However, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy): Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here are five of the 25 stocks that made it through the screen.MGIC Investment (MTG  -  Free Report): The company is the leading provider of private mortgage insurance coverage in the United States to the home mortgage lending industry.

2053,PFE,"GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) along with partner Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that their HIV-focused joint venture company, ViiV Healthcare, has initiated a phase III program to evaluate its two-drug HIV regimen of dolutegravir (Tivicay) and lamivudine (Epivir) The study will evaluate the two-drug regimen for maintenance of viral suppression achieved in HIV-1 infected patients on a three-drug regimen – tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (""TAF"")-based regimen.We remind investors that Glaxo is also evaluating another two-drug based regimen – cabotegravir and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) rilpivirine – in another phase III study for treating adults with virally suppressed HIV-1 infection. Moreover, the company is also evaluating cabotegravir monotherapy for the prevention of HIV infection in sexually active women.HIV treatments generally are three-drug based regimens. The latest entrant in the market is Gilead Sciences, Inc.’s (GILD  -  Free Report) once-daily single tablet regimen, Biktarvy (bictegravir, emtricitabine, tenofovir alafenamide), approved earlier this month. However, Glaxo is trying to reduce the number of medicines in a HIC treatment regimen without compromising on the efficacy of a conventional three-drug regimenShares of GlaxoSmithKline have underperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has lost 9.6% against the industry’s 10.1% rally during the period.The phase III TANGO study will investigate a two-drug regimen for the treatment of HIV. The phase III program is designed to evaluate non-inferior antiviral activity of the combination regimen at 48 weeks compared to continuation of a TAF-based regimen. The study will also evaluate long-term antiviral activity, tolerability and safety of the combination therapy for up to 96 weeks.Glaxo is also evaluating the combination regimen in GEMINI studies in patients with HIV-1 who have received no prior treatment. Data from the GEMINI and TANGO studies are anticipated in 2018.We note that Glaxo’s newest HIV medicine – Juluca is a single tablet containing dolutegravir and J&J’s rilpivirine. Juluca is the first two-drug regimen approved by the FDA.Meanwhile, with several companies interested in developing drugs to treat this life-threatening disease, competition has intensified manifold in the space.GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price | GlaxoSmithKline PLC QuoteZacks RankGlaxoSmithKline carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2054,PFE,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Pfizer has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13.9, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 21.3. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Pfizer’s current PE level puts it almost in-line with its midpoint over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 15.9. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Pfizer has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 12.5, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Pfizer stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Pfizer has a P/S ratio of about 4.3. This is higher than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is just slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, Pfizer is towards the higher end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, which suggests that the company’s stock price has already appreciated to some degree, relative to its sales.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Pfizer currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Pfizer a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 9.8, which is better than the industry average of 12.4. The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company’s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Pfizer might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of C. This gives PFE a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been quite encouraging. The current year has seen eight estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower, while the next year estimate has seen five upward and zero downward revisions in the same time period.As a result, the current year consensus estimate has risen by 6.9% in the past two months, while the next year estimate has increased 5.9%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Pfizer Inc. Price and Consensus  Pfizer Inc. Price and Consensus | Pfizer Inc. QuoteThis bullish trend is why the stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term.Bottom LinePfizer is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Furthermore, a robust industry rank (among the Top 17%) and a solid Zacks Rank instills investor confidence.However, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall as over the past two years, the industry has underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Despite the poor past performance of the industry, a good industry rank signals that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future. Add to this the positive estimate revisions and robust value metrics, and we believe that we have a strong value contender in Pfizer.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2055,PFE,"The Dow traversed a difficult week, declining over three consecutive trading sessions. Investors remained concerned over the prospects of a trade war following President Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Trump’s decision to dismiss Secretary of State Rex Tillerson added to investors’ jitters. Ultimately, investors looking to pick up blue chip stocks on the dip helped the index finish in the green on Thursday.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow increased 1.8% on last Friday, moving past the 25,000 mark for the first time since Feb 28. Upbeat jobs data and lower wage growth subdued inflationary concerns and curbed rate hike fears. The U.S. economy added 313,000 jobs in February, exceeding the consensus estimate of 208,000 job additions. However, average hourly wages rose only 0.1% in February, lower than January’s 0.3% increase.The index gained 3.3% last week. President Trump signed his tariff plan into law per which fresh levies of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports will be imposed. However, the plan excludes countries like Canada and Mexico, offering Trump a chance to renegotiate terms of the NAFTA with the two countries. Also, the United States wants to discuss national security issues with both these countries.The Dow This WeekThe index declined 0.6% on Monday. Investors remained concerned about the prospects of a trade war following Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum. Fears of this nature dragged industrials lower during the session, a decline which weighed on the broader markets.Three Dow components from this sector, United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) declined 1.9%, 0.6% and 2.9%, respectively.The index lost 0.6% on Tuesday after the Trump administration dismissed U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Additionally, Trump ordered Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) to abandon the planned takeover of QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report), following which shares of Qualcomm declined and weighed on the broader markets.Meanwhile, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 0.2% in February, in line with the consensus estimate. This figure was lower than January’s increase of 0.5%. This development significantly reduced rate hike fears.The index decreased 1% on Wednesday, ending in the red for the third consecutive trading day following concerns over a possible trade war between the U.S. and China. Any hostile move from China will jeopardize Boeing’s performance, which is why its shares fell 2.5%, weighing on the Dow, which registered a one-day decline of around 250 points. Shares of 3M declined 1.4%.The index rebounded on Thursday, increasing 0.5%. Special counsel Robert Mueller reportedly subpoenaed Trump Organization for Trump’s business-related documents. This factor along with trade war fears weighed on investor sentiment.However, the Dow managed to post a one-day rise of around 116 points, after investors indulged in bargain hunting, seeking out blue-chip stocks on the dip. Dow component UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH  -  Free Report) increased 1.8% and was the biggest contributor to the blue-chip index’s gains on the day.Components Moving the Index Apple Inc.

2056,PFE,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 19.The Swiss pharmaceutical company’s stock has rallied 14.7% in the last 12 months compared with the industry's 10.6% gain.   Novartis has an excellent track record. In the last quarter, Novartis delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.4%. The company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 3.42% in the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayConcurrent with the 2017 results, Novartis provided guidance for 2018. Novartis expects net sales in 2018 to grow low to mid-single digit. Novartis operates under three segments: Innovative Medicines (Pharmaceuticals), Alcon and Sandoz (Generics).  Innovative Medicines is projected to grow in mid-single digit. Revenues from Sandoz is expected to be broadly in line or decline slightly. Alcon sales are estimated to grow in low to mid-single digits.The Innovative Medicines division recorded sales of $8.8 billion in 2017 as it combatted generic and pricing pressure. Novartis has a strong oncology portfolio of drugs like Afinitor, Exjade, Jakavi, Zykadia, Tasigna, Jadenu, and Kisqali.  Growth products — Cosentyx, Entresto, Promacta/Revolade, Jakavi, Tafinlar + Mekinist and Gilenya continues to drive the top line.Psoriasis Cosentyx achieved multi-blockbuster drug status in 2017 on the back of strong growth in its three approved indications while Entresto’s sales benefited from continued access improvements and expansion of sales force in the United States.  The approval of Kymriah for acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a major boost for Novartis, given the potential in the CAR-T therapy space.Additionally, Novartis' generic arm, Sandoz, is making efforts to strengthen its biosimilars portfolio. The launches of Rixathon, the biosimilar version of Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan (rituximab) and Erelzi, the biosimilar of Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel in EU has boosted the company’s portfolio.However, sales from this division is projected to decline due to continued industry wide pricing pressures in the United States.Meanwhile, the loss of exclusivity of some of the key drugs in Novartis' portfolio will continue to hurt the company's top line.  The company's blockbuster drug, Diovan, is facing stiff generic competition in the United States, the EU and Japan. Gleevec lost exclusivity in the United States in February 2016 and in the EU in December 2016, thereby leading to generic competition. Exforge is also facing generic competition in the United States and the EU. Further, the oncology drugs are facing new competition in the form of immuno-oncology therapies.The ophthalmology division, Alcon was struggling and consequently, Novartis took a few steps to revive the business. The turnaround has been encouraging and management believes creating a standalone company via a capital markets exit could create additional shareholder value. A decision is expected in the first half of 2019, depending on Alcon’s performance in the future.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Novartis will beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. Unfortunately, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Novartis is 0.00%.  This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.25. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Novartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Although the rank is favorable, the company's 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Novartis AG Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Novartis AG Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Novartis AG Quote Stock to ConsiderHere is one stock in the healthcare sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter.Pfizer Inc.

2057,PFE,"Bond yields are scaling record highs on expectations of a hike in interest rate. A two-year budget deal declared by top senators should strengthen the economy giving the Federal Reserve enough reason to raise rates. A pick-up in wages sparked fears of inflation, bolstering expectations that the Fed could take a more aggressive stance in hiking rates.Lest we forget, a soft Treasury auction on Feb 7 dragged bond prices down and helped yields move up. This rise in bond yields rattled the equity market, resulting in a lot of gyrations. And why not? When bond yield rises, it increases the opportunity cost of investing in other asset classes such as equities, thus, making them less attractive.Given such uncertain times, investors should select the safest of stocks, particularly those that are sound enough to withstand the intensifying volatility in the market.US Stocks Finish Lower, Bond Yields SpikeThe stock market is on a roller-coaster this week. Major bourses largely finished in the red on Feb 7 and at current levels, they stand nearly 5% below last month’s record high. The Dow shed 19.42 points to 24,893.35, while the broader S&P 500 slid 13.48 points to 2,681.66. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge, in the meantime, remained at 27.73. Any reading above the 20 mark indicates bearish outlook in the equity market. This is in sharp contrast to the fear gauge’s reading in 2017. Last year, VIX fell as low as 9.14.While stocks struggled for direction, marked by the comeback of once-dormant volatility, treasury yields continued to scale record highs. The 10-year Treasury note yield was up 7.8 basis points to 2.843% following a decline of 2.648% earlier in the week. The two-year Treasury notes rose 4.3 basis points to 2.134%, registering its largest one-day gain since Oct 16. Similarly, the 30-year rate jumped 7.5 basis points to 3.118%, its highest level since March.  What’s Driving Treasurys?Treasury yields moved north after Congressional leaders struck a two-year bipartisan budget deal, boosting expectations of a stronger economy. This in turn bolstered possibility of an imminent rate hike eventually leading to higher bond yields. In fact, record rise in wage growth sparked fears of inflation and led investors to believe that the Fed will hike rates more times than anticipated.Bipartisan Budget DealU.S. Senate leaders reached a deal to raise federal spending by almost $300 billion to address all kinds of fiscal issues that have been plaguing Washington for years. They have agreed to lift caps on defense funding and some domestic government outlays. Defense budget will be raised by $160 billion, while funding for domestic programs will be hiked by $128 billion.Congress has time and again voted to raise the budget caps. Earlier, there have been two bipartisan deals to uplift caps by billions of dollars. The first was in 2013, forged between PaulRyan and Patty Murray, while the second was signed in 2015. However, both the deals that have extended through fiscal 2017 have expired.Wages See Fastest Growth Since 2009The labor market has come a long way since the Great Recession, with wages growing at the fastest pace in January in more than eight-and-a-half years. Average hourly wages increased 9 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.74. This helped the average year-on-year hourly earnings to rise to 2.9%, the highest since June 2009.Needless to say, several states have raised wages. Minimum wage has been raised in 18 states in January, which had a positive impact on 4.5 million workers, per the Economic Policy Institute.Why Spike in Bond Yield Halted a Market Rally?Major selling point for equities since the financial crisis has been rise in bond yields. Investors always compare yield of equities with that of fixed income. In case of equities, earnings are largely considered the yield of a share of stock. Thus, the current rise in bond yields have made these more alluring, compelling investors to pull money out of stocks.Moreover, value of future earnings goes down as interest rates go up. Higher interest rate affects almost everything from mortgages to auto loans. Purchasing a house becomes expensive and credit card bite becomes harder. All these in turn could lead to recession, ending the nine-year-old bull market.Best Screening Parameters Amid Widespread UncertaintyAs the equity market frets over rising yields, make sure you pick safe investments. In general, you should look for companies that are unperturbed by wavering market conditions. The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of low-beta stocks, which are inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in. In this case, a low beta ranges from 0 to 1.These stocks also have a good position in the market and pay out part of its earnings to shareholders as dividends. After all, dividend payers boast solid financial structure and are immune to market vagaries. Further, they are positioned to grow in the near term and are economically priced.5 Top Safe Stocks to BuyWe have, thus, selected five stocks flaunting the aforesaid virtues along with a solid Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2058,PFE,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) and its Japanese partnerAstellas Pharma Inc. announced detailed results from a late-stage study which can expand the label of its prostate cancer drug Xtandi to include early-stage patients.Detailed data from the phase III PROSPER study on Xtandi showed that treatment with the combination of Xtandi (enzalutamide) and androgen deprivation therapy (“ADT”) reduced the risk of metastases or death by 71% compared with ADT alone in men with castration-resistant non-metastatic prostate cancer (“CRPC”).In the double-blind study, the median metastasis-free survival (MFS) — the primary endpoint — was 36.6 months with Xtandi plus ADT versus 14.7 months with ADT alone. We remind investors that top-line data from the PROSPER study was presented by Pfizer/Astellas in September 2017.Based on the results of the study, the company made regulatory filings in the United States and EU.PROSPER study also investigated time to prostate-specific antigen (“PSA”) progression, time to first use of new antineoplastic therapy and overall survival as key secondary endpoints. There was a 93% reduction in the risk of PSA progression in the Xtandi arm compared with ADT alone. The median time to PSA progression in the Xtandi group was 37.2 months compared with 3.9 months for ADT alone.Many prostate cancer patients with non-metastatic CRPC — an earlier stage of prostate cancer — can experience disease progression despite ADT. However, presently no FDA approved treatment options are available to cater to this until these patients develop metastatic disease.Xtandi is presently approved for the treatment of metastatic CRPC in patients who have previously received docetaxel. If approved for the non-metastatic patient population, the label of Xtandi can be expanded to cover all patients with CRPC.Pfizer’s shares have underperformed the industry over a year. The stock has returned 8.1% during this period, comparing unfavorably with an increase of 13.9% for the industry.  Xtandi was added to Pfizer’s portfolio with the acquisition of Medivation in September 2017. While Pfizer sells Xtandi in the United States in partnership with Astellas, the latter owns the marketing right outside the U.S. markets. Pfizer recorded Xtandi alliance revenues of $590 million in 2017. Pfizer, Inc. Price  Pfizer, Inc. Price | Pfizer, Inc.

2059,PFE,"We are approaching the end of the first quarter of 2018. Let us asses how the quarter unfolded for the drug/biotech sector.The year began on a strong note for the drug/biotech sector, particularly on expectations of an increase in M&A activity. Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) have already announced two deals each. Also Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) is aggressively on the lookout for a buyer for its Consumer Healthcare unit after British firms Glaxo (GSK  -  Free Report) and Reckitt Benckiser Group pulled out of discussions.After a solid run in the first two months of the first quarter, the drug/biotech sectors struggled in March, probably on broader market pressure and a few negative updates on the pipeline and regulatory front.The large-cap pharma industry has declined 4.6% this year so far while the biotech industry has declined 5.7% in the same time frame. Both have underperformed the 2.9% fall for the S&P 500 in the same time frame.  However, please note that in the first two months of the year, both the sectors recorded gains and so did the S&P 500. However, all three declined in the month of March.What Put Breaks on the Momentum?AbbVie’s Rova-T fell short of expectations in a key lung cancer study. Dermira’s acne candidate, olumacostat glasaretil, surprisingly failed to meet the primary endpoint in two studies. Celgene was issued a refusal to file letter by the FDA for Ozanimod (multiple sclerosis) NDA and Biogen and partner AbbVie announced the voluntary decision to withdraw multiple sclerosis drug, Zinbryta from worldwide markets due to risk of liver injury. Orexigen Therapeutics meanwhile filed for bankruptcy. Solid Biosciences’ mid-stage study on lead duchenne muscular dystrophy candidate SGT-001 was put on clinical hold and Protagonist Therapeutics announced discontinuation of a mid-stage study on its key ulcerative colitis treatment.Is a Recovery in the Cards?It is widely expected that the biotech/drug sector will rebound as the year progresses. We believe that new product sales ramp up with rising demand, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results, more frequent FDA approvals, continued strong performance of key products, growing demand for drugs especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an aging population and increased health care spending are some of the factors that should keep the sector on track. A faster drug approval process and the proposed removal of outdated regulations that drive up costs and slow down innovation should also provide benefits.With the outlook optimistic for the rest of the year, here we highlight four stocks that may prove to be good buys. All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) and have seen their share price and earnings estimates rise this year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.GlaxoAfter underperforming the broader industry in 2017, Glaxo’s shares have picked up this year. Glaxo’s stock has risen 7.3% this year so far. Meanwhile, estimates for 2018 and 2019 rose 5% and 4.8%, respectively in the past 60 days.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is expected to record sales growth of 4% this year and 2.5% next yearAdverum Biotechnologies (ADVM  -  Free Report) Adverum Biotechnologies carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Loss estimates for the company narrowed 24.3% for 2018 and 26.2% for 2019 over the last 60 days. Sales growth this year for this biotech stock is expected to be 8.2%. Adverum shares have returned 83.5% this year so far.Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND  -  Free Report)This #2 Ranked stock has risen 23.3% this year while earnings estimates for 2018 and 2019 rose 11.1% and 12%, respectively, over the past 60 days. This company is expected to record sales growth of around 25% this year and 18% next year.H. Lundbeck A/S (HLUYY  -  Free Report)On a year-to-date basis, Lundbeck shares have gained 13.1%. Meanwhile, earnings estimates for 2018 increased 8.5% over the past 60 days for this #2 Ranked stock.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

2060,PFE,"A new drug application (“NDA”) for Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) anaplastic lymphoma kinase (“ALK”) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (“TKI”) candidate, lorlatinib has been accepted by the FDA. The NDA sought approval of lorlatinib for the treatment of patients ALK-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) who have received prior treatment with one or more ALK TKIs. The NDA has also been granted priority review. A decision is expected in August 2018.Similar applications seeking marketing authorization in Europe and Japan have also been accepted by the regulatory agencies of the respective countries.Shares of Pfizer were up almost 1.5% following the news. The stock has returned 6.3% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 11% in that period.Pfizer submitted the regulatory applications based on positive data from phase II portion of a phase I/II study, evaluating lorlatinib in several cohorts based on prior therapies.Non-small cell lung cancer occurs in 85% of the patients who have lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death worldwide.Lung cancer is an attractive avenue for pharmaceutical companies due to the widespread occurrence of the disease. However, it is also one of the most competitive spaces due to the presence of a large number of players. Several large and small companies are either developing or have approved therapies for the treatment of various forms of lung cancer.We remind investors that last month Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) announced encouraging results from a phase III study evaluating its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, in combination with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Alimta and carboplatin in NSCLC. We also note that Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) recently presented data on Tecentriq in novel combinations across a broad range of tumors including lung cancer.Blockbuster drugs like Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo is approved for treating NSCLC, among others.Pfizer, Inc.

2061,PFE,"Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Janssen, announced that the FDA has granted approval to its prostate cancer drug, Zytiga, (abiraterone acetate) in combination with prednisone to treat an early stage of prostate cancer.Notably, Zytiga, was earlier approved in both the United States and the EU to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in treatment-experienced patients, whose chemotherapy contained docetaxel.  With this latest nod from the regulatory body, the drug’s label has been expanded to treat newly-diagnosed patients with metastatic high-risk castration-sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC).Zytiga was approved for treatment of newly diagnosed CSPC patients in the EU in November 2017. The company also submitted regulatory filings for the combination therapy in Japan, Canada, Mexico, Switzerland, Singapore and Philippines for the given indication.J&J’s shares have outperformed the industry in a year’s time. The stock has increased 10.8%, comparing favorably with the industry’s 10.1% rally. The FDA approval for the expanded patient population was supported by encouraging data from a pivotal phase III LATITUDE study, evaluating Zytiga/prednisone’s combination on CSPC patients with no prior experience of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Data from the trial demonstrated a statistically significant and improvement in overall survival in the given patients’ population. The combination regimen showed a reduction in death risk by 38% compared with placebos.It is important to note that Zytiga is one of the most important and successful products in the company’s oncology portfolio. The drug’s sales surged 45.5% to $755 million in fourth-quarter 2017 owing to an improved share in a growing metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer market. It was the highest prescribed oral medication in the United States for patients with metastatic CRPC in 2016.Approval for the combination therapy on CSPC patient population should increase Zytiga’s sales in the future quarters.Incidentally, another marketed drug for CSPC patients, having received docetaxel therapy, is Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and Japanese company, Astellas Pharma’s, combined Xtandi (enzalutamide).Though Zytiga is facing patent challenges in the United States, the company anticipates no impact from generic competition for the drug this year. Also, J&J is confident that it can absorb the effect of any potential Zytiga headwind, should there be an earlier-than-expected generic launch in 2018.Johnson & Johnson Price Johnson & Johnson Price | Johnson & Johnson Quote Zacks Rank & Key PicksJ&J carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2062,PFE,"Total earnings for 86.8% of the total healthcare market capitalization are up 8.2% on revenue growth of 6.5%. Not only are the growth rates impressive, the earnings and revenues beat ratios of 83.8% and 86.5%, respectively, are great too. The robust numbers have pushed healthcare stocks higher by an average 1.2% against the 0.2% gain for the S&P 500 in response to earnings announcements.Among the most notable players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) was the first major drug company to report earnings on Jan 23, followed by Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) on Jan 30 and Jan 31, respectively.

2063,PFE,"Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved a label expansion of its anti-infective drug, Avycaz (ceftazidime and avibactam). With this nod, the drug is now approved for treatment of patients with hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP) due to gram-negative bacteria. This approval marks the third therapeutic indication for the drug in the United States.Notably, Avycaz is marketed for treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), including pyelonephritis, caused by designated susceptible pathogens consisting of certain Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Avycaz is also indicated for curing adult patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) in combination with metronidazole.We remind investors that the company’s supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Avycaz was accepted by the FDA under priority review in October 2017 based on a preceding Qualified Infectious Disease Product designation for the aforementioned indication.Importantly, Avycaz is the first gram-negative antibiotic approved in the United States to treat HABP/VABP in over 15 years.Allergan’s shares have lost 22.2% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry’s decline of 24.4%. The approval was based on non-inferiority data from a pivotal phase III REPROVE study, evaluating the safety and efficacy of Avycaz on adult patients with HABP/VABP. The trial met its primary endpoints and showed that the drug was non-inferior to meropenem, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, in reducing death risks irrespective of the cause.The drug also showed in vitro (study in controlled environment outside human body) activity against certain gram-negative bacteria causing HABP/VABP.Significantly, Avycaz is jointly marketed by Allergan and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report). While Allergan has commercialization rights to Avycaz in North America, rights to the rest of the world are owned by Pfizer.Avycaz raked in sales of $42.7 million in the nine months ending Sep 30, 2017, up 58.7% from the year-ago figure. The FDA approval for the expanded patient population should improve its commercial potential.Per the company’s press release, HABP/VABP is the second most common type of nosocomial (hospital originated) infection in the United States, mainly in the intensive care unit. Hence, the potential market opportunity for Avycaz is huge in the country.Apart from Avycaz, Allergan’s anti-infectives portfolio comprises antibiotics namely Teflaro and Dalvance.Allergan PLC.

2064,PFE,"The Dow experienced a mixed week, losing momentum over the first few days before rebounding over the next two. Bond yields spiked following improved inflation and rate hike prospects leading investors to switch from equities to bonds. Such expectations were heightened after the Fed indicated that a rate hike in March was more or less certain. Financial blue-chips gained as a result, which, along with bullish earnings numbers helped the index gain over the latter half of the week.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow increased 0.8% last Friday following better-than-expected earnings from Intel Corporation INTC. Additionally, the Dow posted a rise of more than 220 points. Meanwhile, U.S. GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017, following gains of more than 3% in the two previous quarters.This marks the economy’s strongest stretch of growth since the expansion started in mid-2009. Additionally, during the week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that any weakness in the dollar was beneficial for trade. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index fell 1.5% for the week to settle at 89.07, following Mnuchin’s comments.The index gained 2.2% over last week. Benchmarks registered their fourth straight weekly increase after the Senate gave its consent to pass a Bill that ends the recent government shutdown. Additionally, encouraging earnings results by The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report), 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) and Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) boosted markets.The Dow This WeekThe index decreased 0.7% on Monday, suffering its biggest one-day drop on Monday since Sep 5, 2017. These losses came following a shift in investment from equities to bonds after Treasury yields reached their best level since April 2014.Expectations of an increase in growth and inflation boosted yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note, following which sectors like real estate and utilities that are considered as alternatives to bonds declined. Shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) fell 2.1% on news that the tech behemoth has decided to halve its production target for the iPhone X in the first three months of the year.The index lost 1.4% on Tuesday following slump in both healthcare and energy stocks. Blue-chips like Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) announced that they will together form a healthcare company in order to cut related costs for their U.S. employees.This announcement weighed on the healthcare sector. Oil prices fell on Tuesday after U.S. shale production came in at 9,878,000 barrels per day, its highest level since Jan 7, 1983, per the EIA. Separately, higher rate environment and optimism of a steady economic growth and higher inflation weighed on bond prices.The index increased 0.3% on Wednesday after two straight days of declines. Shares of The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) rose 4.9% settling at its best levels ever, after the aircraft manufacturer posted fourth-quarter earnings per share and revenues that beat expectations, which in turn boosted key indexes.Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve opted to leave benchmark rates unchanged within the 1.25-1.5% range. Markets lost some of their gains after the Fed stated that inflation was likely to reach its desired level in the medium term and projected gradual increase in key rates.The index gained 0.1% on Thursday even as investors switched from equities to bonds after Treasury bond yields continued to hover near their best levels since April 2014. However, rising rate hike prospects helped financial blue-chips The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

These losses were caused by a surge in bond yields, a phenomenon which is likely to bother investors in the days ahead as well. However, with the Fed delineating its plans fairly clearly, markets are likely to price in a March rate hike in the near term. Given such a backdrop along with bullish earnings and a strong economy, markets are likely to notch up fresh milestones in the days ahead.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2065,PFE,"Benchmarks finished in negative territory on Tuesday following slump in both healthcare and energy stocks. Blue-chips like Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan announced that they will together form a healthcare company in order to cut related costs for their U.S. employees, which in turn weighed on the healthcare sector.Additionally, recent increase in U.S. shale production led energy stocks downward. Moreover, rising bond yields had a broad-based negative impact on all the three key indexes. The S&P 500 experienced its worst one-day performance since August, 2017 and Dow witnessed its biggest one-day drop since last May.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 1.4%, or 361.90 points to close at 26,076.89. The S&P 500 fell 1.1% to close at 2,822.43. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,402.48, losing 0.9%.

A total of around 8.1 billion shares were traded on Tuesday, higher than the last 20-session average of 7.1 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 4.17-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 2.98-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.What Moved the Benchmarks?On Tuesday, e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) made an announcement that together with Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) a healthcare company will be built in order to cut costs for their U.S. employees and improve worker satisfaction.

Both WTI and Brent crude prices decreased to 1.6% and 0.6% to settle at $64.50 per barrel and $69.02 a barrel, respectively.Decrease in oil prices had an adverse impact on the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE), which slumped 2%, becoming the second worst performing sectors of the S&P 500.

Lower bond prices supported the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which increased from 2.695% to 2.725% on Tuesday, reaching its highest settlement in almost four years. Higher treasury yields also weighed on the broader equity markets.Stocks That Made HeadlinesC.H. Robinson Surpasses on Earnings & Revenues in Q4C.H.

2066,PFE,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is a research-based, global pharmaceutical company that discovers, develops, manufactures, and markets medicines for humans. The Company's diversified global healthcare portfolio includes human and animal biologic and small molecule medicines and vaccines, as well as nutritional products and consumer healthcare products. It sells its products to wholesalers, distributors, retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies, pharmacies, individual provider offices, and grocery and convenience stores.In its most recent reported quarter, Q4 18, the company easily beat both the Zacks consensus earnings and revenue estimates.  Pfizer posted year over year gains in revenues +1%, adjusted income +30%, and adjusted diluted EPS +32%.  The report also showed that the company’s tax rate would fall from 23% to about 17%, and that management approved a $5 billion share repurchase program.  Further, during the conference call management alluded to future consolidation within the segment along with several partnerships. The company’s innovative business segment, branded drugs, vaccines, and consumer health, grew by +8% YoY with direct sales revenues improving by +47% YoY.  The big drivers behind the success of the innovative segment was Eliquis, oral anticoagulant prescribed by cardiologists, Xeljanz, used for moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, and Prevnar, a pneumonia vaccine. Looking ahead, besides its legacy branded drugs, the company has a strong pipeline of new products focused on oncology, and biosimilars (generic drugs).  One of the most exciting new drugs is Ibrance, a new treatment for breast cancer that is expected to generate almost $6 billion in annual sales by 2020. Towards the end of 2017, management approved a +6.3% increase to its quarterly dividend, making the new annual dividend $1.36, or a +3.7% annual yield.  Pfizer has paid an annual dividend since 1901, and has increased it for the past nine consecutive years.  Moreover, the company is expected to use its tax savings to further increase its share repurchase program, and boost its dividend payments for the next several years. This strong earnings report, and positive future outlook has caused analysts to increase their earnings estimates for the next two quarters and next two fiscal years as you can see in the table below.Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #2 (Strong Buy) is a major American airline with its headquarters on the northern boundary of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, within the city limits of Atlanta. Delta started operation by crop dusting and flying mail and then introduced passenger service. Delta's business is focused on making global connections, flying people and cargo throughout the United States and around the world. Delta Air Lines offers customers service to more destinations than any global airline with Delta and Delta Connection carrier service. Delta Air Lines and the Delta Connection carriers offer service to nearly 370 destinations on six continents. Delta has added more international capacity than all other U.S. airlines combined and is the leader across the Atlantic.In the company’s most recent quarter, they beat the Zacks consensus earnings and revenue estimates for the second consecutive quarter.  The report showed that revenues were up +8.3% overall with domestic up +7%, total passenger improving by +6.6%, cargo rising by +14.4%, and other revenues gaining +17.9% YoY.  Earnings Per Share improved by +17.1% YoY.  The big jump in other revenues was due to several key areas; club and on-board sales, administrative fees, loyalty programs, ancillary businesses, baggage fees, and refinery. Another tailwind for the company is their co-brand partnership with American Express as Delta gets the interchange fee.  In 2017, the Delta AmEx card portfolio realized $80.9 billion in charges where $1.975 billion in EBIT went to Delta.  This is expected to increase to $2.7 billion by 2020 due to the contractual increase in the price per mile Delta gets from AmEx.  Further, the whole partnership deal with AmEx generated $3 billion in revenues in 2017, and this is expected to increase to $4 billion by 2021 (the contract goes through 2022). Looking forward, management guided 2018 EPS in a range between $6.35-6.70, well above its previous guidance of $5.35-5.70.  This boost is mostly due to the tax reform plan which by itself is expected to benefit EPS by $1.00-1.25.  For Q1 18, management guided EPS at $0.65-0.75, and increased Revenue Per Available Seat (RASM) expectations from 2.5-4.5% YoY to 4-5%.  The rise in RASM is due to improvements in both leisure, and business travel. The increase in 2018 EPS guidance and upgraded Q1 18 RASM expectations caused analysts to positively revise estimates for FY 18, and FY 19.  Further, the stock price has continued to move upwards since the beginning of 2016.  You can see both of these improvements in the Price and Earnings consensus graph below.Price and Consensus  Price and Consensus |  QuoteDuring the December quarter the company repurchased $325 million worth of stock as part of its $5 billion share repurchase program announced in March of 2017.  The company also pays a solid annual dividend yield of +2.16%.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

2067,PFE,"Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) received a major boost when the FDA approved the company’s once-daily single tablet regimen (“STR”), Biktarvy (bictegravir 50mg/emtricitabine 200mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25mg, BIC/FTC/TAF) for HIV-1 infection.The approval, which comes ahead of the PDUFA date of Feb 12, 2018, provides a major boost to Gilead’s HIV franchise.Though the company topped both earnings and revenue estimates in the fourth quarter, the magnitude of the decline in HCV sales was wider-than-expected. The HCV franchise has been under pressure for a while due to lower patient starts and increased competition form AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report).The company’s guidance for 2018 also lacks lustre and we expect sales of the same to decline further.  Amid such a scenario, the approval of this latest triple HIV therapy is likely to provide an impetus to the stock as Gilead is now banking on its HIV franchise and newer avenues like the CAR-T therapy post the Kite acquisition and promising NASH candidates for growth. Following the news of the approval, shares of the company moved up 3.8%. Gilead’s stock has gained 14.4% in the last six months as against the industry's decline of 3.6%.Biktarvy, Gilead’s latest triple therapy, is approved as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults who have no antiretroviral treatment history or to replace the current antiretroviral regimen in those who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen for at least three months with no history of treatment failure and no known substitutions associated with resistance to the individual components of Biktarvy.Meanwhile, the HIV franchise continues to gain traction on the back of rapid adoption of TAF-based regimens in the United States and EU. The TAF-based regimens now represent 62% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya along with Odefsey and Descovy in 2016.Biktarvy combines the novel, unboosted integrase strand transfer inhibitor (“INSTI”) bictegravir, with the demonstrated safety and efficacy profile of the Descovy, (FTC/TAF) dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (“NRTI”) backbone, and is the smallest INSTI-based triple-therapy STR available.The approval of Biktarvy was supported by encouraging data from four ongoing studies: Studies 1489 and 1490 in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults, and Studies 1844 and 1878 in virologically suppressed adults. Biktarvy met its primary objective of non-inferiority at 48 weeks across all four studies.However, Biktarvy has a Boxed Warning in its product label regarding the risk of post treatment acute exacerbation of hepatitis B.The approval of this new HIV therapy will pose stiff competition to GlaxoSmith’s (GSK  -  Free Report) existing therapies, Tivicay and Triumeq.On the other hand, per a report from Reuters, ViiV Healthcare, a joint venture majority-owned by GlaxoSmith with Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and Shionogi Ltd has filed a lawsuit against Gilead alleging patent infringement on ViiV's dolutegravir, a component of the venture's triple-drug HIV treatment Triumeq.Zacks RankGilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

2068,PFE,"Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (MNTA  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA classified the outcome of fourth-quarter 2017 reinspection of Pfizer, Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) McPherson facility as Voluntary Action Indicated (“VAI”).Glatopa 20 mg/mL was approved by the FDA in 2015. Glatopa 20 mg/mL is the first ""AP"" rated, substitutable generic equivalent of once-daily Copaxone. The generic was developed and is being commercialized in collaboration with Sandoz AG, or Sandoz, the generic arm of Novartis Pharma AG (NVS  -  Free Report).Per the collaboration agreement, Sandoz is responsible for commercialization of Glatopa 20 mg/mL, and Momenta earns 50% of contractually-defined profits on the drug’s sales.Sandoz’s abbreviated New Drug Application (""ANDA"") for the 40-mg thrice-weekly formulation of Copaxone (Glatopa 40mg) was under the FDA review. However, Momenta suffered a setback with the FDA issuing a warning letter to Pfizer in February 2017, which is Sandoz’s contracted fill/finish manufacturing partner for Glatopa.While the ANDA for Glatopa remains under regulatory review, Momenta believes that the application review could be completed at any time in connection with the change to the VAI status.  The news brought a breath of fresh air to investors and the company’s shares went up 5.2%. Momenta’s stock has lost 10.9% over a year, underperforming the industry’s rally of 10.5%.Nevertheless, with the announced change in compliance status for McPherson, Kansas facility amended to VAI, Momenta expects to gain marketing approval and subsequently launch Glatopa 40 mg in the first half of 2018.Momenta has had a rough time in 2017. Mylan NV (MYL  -  Free Report) obtained FDA approval for a generic version of Copaxone 40 mg making it the first generic to be approved. This was a huge setback for Momenta. With Mylan launching both Copaxone 20mg and Copaxone 40mg product, the company expects revenues from Glatopa to be adversely impacted due to declines in both price and volume. Moreover, there will be additional pressure in the market for customers to switch from the 20mg product to the 40mg product.The company also suffered a blow in regard to the development of its biosimilar candidate, M834. The candidate did not meet its primary pharmacokinetic end points in a phase I study to compare the pharmacokinetics, safety and immunogenicity of M834 to reference drug Orencia in normal healthy volunteers. Hence, Momenta and partner Mylan will evaluate the next course of action.Zacks RankMomenta currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2069,PFE,"Stock market futures are down pretty deeply into the red this morning, after an average close on the main indexes of roughly half a percentage point. However, no blame can be placed on Q4 earnings season, which continues to bring about robust results from companies across the spectrum of industries. Asian markets were down slightly overnight, and later this evening we await President Trump’s initial State of the Union address. Later this week, beginning tomorrow, we start to see new data on January jobs numbers.Keeping with Q4 earnings results, here are 4 leaders in their respective spaces and how well they have performed relative to expectations, particularly the Zacks consensus estimates:McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) posted strong quarterly numbers both on top- and bottom-lines ahead of the opening bell today. Earnings of $1.71 per share easily outpaced the $1.59 expected. Revenues reached $5.34 billion in the company’s Q4, ahead of the $5.26 billion in the Zacks consensus.Beating estimates is nothing new for McDonald’s, whose previous average positive earnings surprise over the past 4 quarters was over 5%. In the quarter just reported, McDonald’s benefited from stronger comps, up 5.5% year over year. For more on MCD’s earnings, click here.Big Pharma player Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) also beat estimates on both earnings and revenues, with 62 cents per share on $13.70 billion in sales topping the 56 cents and $13.61 billion expected, respectively. Earnings growth year over year was a nice 32%, while revenues were up 1%. Revenue guidance for full-year 2018 remains in range of the current Zacks consensus estimate, whereas earnings guidance of between $2.90-3.00 per share is out ahead of the $2.77 we had earlier expected. For more on PFE’s earnings, click here.Health insurance major Aetna (AET  -  Free Report), on the other hand, posted mixed results for its Q4, with $1.23 per share surpassing the $1.18 we were looking for, but revenues of $14.74 billion lower than the $14.89 billion expected, and down further from the $15.72 billion a year ago. Enrollment is down as Congress continues to chip away at the Affordable Care Act, which was good for Aetna: the previous 4 quarters generated an average 23% positive earnings surprise. For more on AET’s earnings, click here.Global asset management firm T. Rowe Price (TROW  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, also posted earnings and revenue beats for its Q4 report: $1.52 per share outperformed the Zacks consensus by 7 cents, while the $1.29 billion in revenues did better than the $1.27 billion estimated and the $1.09 billion in the year-ago quarter. Bottom-line earnings provided a bigger surprise than the previous 4 quarters’ +1.53% average. For more on TROW’s earnings, click here.

2070,PFE,"The Dow endured a volatile week during which the index hit a fresh record high. A fall in bank shares led to losses for the index on Monday. The index slipped on Tuesday following positive news from a major component. Surging treasury yields led to losses for the index on Wednesday. Ultimately, the index surged to a record high on Thursday following investor optimism over economic growth.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow gained 0.9% last Friday due to optimism built around the implementation of the GOP Tax Bill. Such broad-based gains ensured an improvement for three major benchmarks, negating the effects of dismal economic data.Nonfarm payrolls for the month of December came in at 148,000, lower than the consensus estimate of 190,000 job additions. Further, the U.S. trade deficit increased 3.2% in November to settle at $50.5 billion. This is its highest deficit since January 2012. The ISM Services Index for December declined 1.5 points to 55.7%.The index added an impressive 220.7 points on Friday to finish the session above the 25,000 milestone for the second straight day. This marked its third-straight record close in last four trading sessions — its best opening week since 2006. Gains for the blue-chip index were rather broad based.Over last week, the index gained 2.3%. This marked the Dow’s best weekly run since Dec 1, 2017. During this period the Dow touched the psychological level of 25,000 for the first time. This was the index’s fastest 1,000-point rise since its inception in May 1896.Optimism over strong market performance in 2018 contributed to these gains. Favorable economic data, including an upbeat manufacturing report and record construction spending boosted markets.The Dow This WeekThe index lost almost 0.1% or nearly 13 points on Monday due to a fall in bank shares that snapped its winning run. This marked an end to its four-day streak of gains. The blue-chip index hit an intraday record of 25,311.99 earlier in the session but suffered broad based losses to finish in the negative territory.Shares of major banks such as The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) declined by 1.5% and about 0.4% respectively and weighed on the Dow. Bank shares declined after analysts estimated that there would be one-time charges to the fourth quarter earnings that the banks would suffer due to the implementation of tax reforms.The index increased 0.4% on Tuesday following reports that The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) had delivered a record number of airplanes in 2017 pushed the Dow into record territory. Such events led to shares of Boeing gaining 2.7%, which contributed as much as 57 points to the Dow.The blue-chip index amassed 120.8 points to finish at a record 25,385.80. What also contributed to Dow’s gains was increase in the shares of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), which gained 1.6% and added 15 points to the Dow.The index lost 0.1% on Wednesday after yields on the 10-year benchmark note surged following reports that China was considering halting purchase of U.S. Treasuries. Markets also suffered losses after reports from Canada surfaced that its government expects Trump to pull out of NAFTA soon. Meanwhile, cost of imported goods in the United States surged to a six year high.The index gained 0.8% or 205 points on Thursday hitting another all-time high following investor optimism over economic growth. Shares of Boeing gained 2.4%, emerging as the largest contributor for the Dow. The aircraft manufacturer will likely be one of the major beneficiaries of higher economic growth. Meanwhile, the PPI index declined by 0.1%, moving lower for the first time in more than a year.  Components Moving the IndexBoeing’s 2017 deliveries show a 2% rise in commercial shipments and 5.9% decline in defense shipments, on a year-over-year basis. The company reported commercial deliveries of 763 jets in 2017, up on higher 737, 747 and 767 deliveries. The figure was within the company’s delivery guidance of 760 to 765.In 2017, Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Boeing delivered 529 models of the 737 airplanes, followed by 136 deliveries of the 787 model. Boeing delivered 74 units of the 777 model in 2017, compared with 99 units a year ago. Other deliveries include 10 767s and 14 747s, compared with 13 and 9 units, respectively.In the defense and space business, Boeing’s deliveries were 174 in 2017, down from 185 a year ago.

2071,PFE,"With the rise in demand for immuno-oncology drugs and their combinations, Merck & Co., Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, is fast becoming the key top-line driver of the pharma giant.Keytruda is marketed for many types of cancers and treatment settings including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma and bladder cancer.Having crossed the $1-billion mark in sales during the third quarter of 2017, Keytruda became the second largest product in the Merck portfolio. The treatment fetched in sales of $2.51 billion in the first nine months of 2017, up 174% year over year. This upside is driven by the global launch of new indications, which further boosts demand. Keytruda sales are gaining particularly from a strong momentum in the indication of first-line lung cancer as the therapy is the only anti-PD-1 approved in the first-line setting.The Keytruda development program also significantly advanced in 2017with regulatory approvals secured for six new indications in the United States, four in Europe and three in Japan. Key approvals for indications included advanced bladder cancer, advanced microsatellite instability-high cancers and the first approval of a combination therapy with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drugs Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo) for first-line lung cancer.The new approvals expanded the patient population, driving up sales in the third quarter. This momentum should be maintained in the fourth quarter and in 2018 as well.Meanwhile, Keytruda is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer in above 600 studies including excess of 400 combination trials. Merck is collaborating with several companies including Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report), Incyte, Glaxo and Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report), separately for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens. Data from several programs on Keytruda were presented at medical conferences in 2017.We expect Merck to present data from several key Keytruda studies this year including a combination study with Incyte’s epacadostat in first-line metastatic melanoma. Also, Keytruda could get an approval for the relapsed or refractory primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma indication this year with FDA action expected in April.ConclusionMerck did witness some setbacks regarding Keytruda’s pipeline program in 2017. In October, the company announced a delay in the readout from an important lung cancer study and postponed it to 2019. This was due to the inclusion of overall survival as a co-primary endpoint in the KEYNOTE-189 phase III study of Keytruda in first-line lung cancer. This in turn raised investor concern as the delay in the readout can give competitors a chance to gain traction in the lung cancer market.Also, three combination studies of Keytruda on multiple myeloma were put on clinical hold, following reports of death in Keytruda groups last July.Also Merck’s top line has been lately hurt by a generic competition from several drugs and pricing pressure. We believe, Keytruda has immense commercial potential and coupled with some other newer drugs, can ease the impact of genericization. Although rivalry in the immuno-oncology market has risen following FDA approval of newer oncology treatments like Pfizer’s Bavencio (avelumab) for Merkel-cell carcinoma (MCC) and bladder cancer indications and AstraZeneca’s Imfinzi (durvalumab) for bladder cancer, we believe that Keytruda can give these drugs a tough run for money as there is ample scope for growth in the immuno-oncology space.Merck carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Shares of Merck have declined 6.5% in a year against the industry's rally of 18.1%.  Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes """"All In"""" on This Stock Full disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

2072,PFE,"Focus this week was on the 36th annual JPMorgan healthcare conference where several biotech and pharma companies provided a preliminary look at their results for 2017 and also provided pipeline updates as well as their outlooks for 2018.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesKey Takeaways from JPMorgan Healthcare Conference: Several pharma companies were present at the 36th annual JPMorgan healthcare conference, the largest and most informative healthcare investment symposium in the industry. Among key updates, Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) said that it expects 2018 to be a rich data delivery year. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) also provided a look at its pipeline including opportunities for Opdivo. The company also said that business development remains an important priority with the focus being on deals that make sense from a financial perspective and where the assets and technologies are strategically aligned to its priorities and are potentially transformational. Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) is also on the lookout for business development deals while exercising financial discipline. The company said that it is looking at opportunities through licensing deals and bolt-on acquisitions to add drugs/technology that address unmet medical needs (Read more: Key Takeaways from Pfizer & 3 Other Drug Stocks at Healthcare Conference). Allergan was also present at the conference with its preliminary financial outlook for 2018 (Read more: Allergan's Sales Guidance for 2018 Lower Than Expected). GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report), meanwhile, is looking to strengthen its pharma pipeline by prioritizing its development capital focus on two core (respiratory and HIV/infectious diseases) and two potential therapy (immuno-inflammation and oncology) areas. Glaxo is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Novo Nordisk Goes Public With Ablynx Proposal: Novo Nordisk (NVO  -  Free Report) confirmed that it is looking to acquire Belgium-based biopharma company Ablynx. Novo Nordisk had initially proposed to acquire Ablynx for €26.75 per share in cash. However, the company came back with a revised offer when Ablynx rejected the first proposal. Novo Nordisk’s latest offer includes an upfront cash payment of €28 per share plus a contingent value right (“CVR”) worth up to €2.50 per share (total equity valuation of approximately €2.6 billion). This offer, too, has been rejected by Ablynx with the company’s Board announcing that the proposal fundamentally undervalues Ablynx and its growth prospects.A look at Ablynx’s pipeline shows that the company could well be in a position to launch its first product, caplacizumab (anti-vWF; acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura - aTTP), this year. Caplacizumab is currently under review in the EU while a regulatory application will be filed in the United States in the first half of 2018. The estimated annual market opportunity for aTTP, a life-threatening blood clotting disease, is expected to be about €1.2 billion. The company also has a broad range of partnerships with the potential to generate more than €10.6 billion in milestones plus royalties. Other pipeline candidates also address significant market opportunities. While currently there are no rumors about additional bidders, the EU approval of caplacizumab could well change this scenario.As far as Novo Nordisk is concerned, the acquisition would make sense with caplacizumab being a good fit for the company’s hematology portfolio. The deal would also give a boost to Novo Nordisk’s pipeline especially given the continued pricing pressure within diabetes care, particularly in the United States (Read more: Novo Nordisk Confirms Bid for Ablynx But Faces Rejection).Sanofi & Regeneron Boost R&D Investment in Dupixent and Cemiplimab: Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and partner Regeneron have decided to boost their investment in the development of cemiplimab (a PD-1 antibody) in oncology and Dupixent (an IL-4/IL-13 pathway-blocking antibody) in type 2 allergic diseases. Based on this decision, investment in cemiplimab will shoot up to at least $1.64 billion, an increase of approximately $1 billion from the initial agreement, with both companies contributing equally. Cemiplimab is being studied as monotherapy as well as in combination with other therapies in a wide range of cancers including advanced skin cancers, non-small cell lung cancer, cervical cancer and lymphomas. Regulatory applications for cemiplimab in advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma are scheduled to be submitted in the European Union and the United States in the first quarter of 2018.  Meanwhile, Dupixent, currently approved for eczema, has the potential to be evaluated for additional indications including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peanut allergy and grass allergy and in patients who have multiple allergic conditions. This is in addition to ongoing development in pediatric atopic dermatitis, pediatric asthma, eosinophilic esophagitis and nasal polyposis. Regeneron and Sanofi are currently seeking FDA approval for Dupixent in uncontrolled, persistent asthma in patients at least 12 years old.Another candidate that should benefit from the additional investment is REGN3500, an IL-33 antibody, with potential in atopic dermatitis, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Development Updates from Merck: Merck provided late-stage data on its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, as monotherapy for surgically resected high-risk melanoma. Keytruda met the primary endpoint of recurrence-free survival (“RFS”).Merck also announced that the FDA has accepted its regulatory applications for doravirine, its investigational non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (“NNRTI”) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults. A response from the agency is expected by Oct 23, 2018.The FDA also granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to Eisai’s Lenvima (lenvatinib) in combination with Keytruda for the treatment of patients with advanced and/or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”). Breakthrough Therapy Designation helps fasten the development and review of drugs which are being evaluated for the treatment of serious conditions and where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may be substantially better than existing treatments on clinically significant endpoint(s) (Read more: Merck's Keytruda Combo Gets Breakthrough Therapy Status).Merck’s stock is down 7.4% over the last one year, compared to the 18.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index was up 1% over the last five trading sessions.

2074,PFE,"The spotlight is again on the Parkinson’s Disease (PD) space this week. It has turned out to be an important focus area with Adamas Pharmaceuticals (ADMS  -  Free Report) launching its PD drug, Gocovri, and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) dropping its plans to develop treatments for the indication.Adamas Pharmaceuticals has of late announced a full commercial launch of its lead product, Gocovri, in the United States for treating dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), who are on levodopa-based therapy. The drug was approved by the FDA last August, based on positive data from two phase III studies. Significantly, this is the first and the only drug to receive an approval for this indication in the United States.Pfizer reportedly announced that it will abandon plans to develop treatments for Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease. Per news sources, Pfizer expects this decision to lead to eliminate 300 positions from the neuroscience discovery and early development programs.Let us take a look at what is happening in this difficult-to-treat disease space.What Is Parkinson’s Disease?Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive, degenerative neurological movement disorder, resulting from the loss of dopamine-producing brain cells. This disease mainly progresses with age.It is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer’s. Nearly seven to 10 million people worldwide are living with Parkinson’s disease. Around 1.5 million people in the United States are suffering from this indication with approximately 60,000 people diagnosed with the disease annually. Of this, almost 40% cases prove fatal each year.Additionally, the disease is expected to claim patients by multiplying to more than double within 2040. The combined direct and indirect cost of Parkinson’s including treatment, social security payments and the lost income from inability to work, is estimated at nearly $25 billion per annum in the United States alone. Per GBI Research, the Parkinson’s disease market is estimated to touch $3.2 billion by 2021 at a CAGR of 5.7%.With the incidence of the disease rising globally, given a rapid increase in greying populace, the research for innovative therapies in Parkinson’s space has grown in the last decade.  Present Drugs Show Side EffectsIt has been observed that PD patients under traditional medications like levodopa often suffer side effects. However, despite this drawback, PD is predominantly treated with levodopa and dopamine agonists. Key medicines that dominate the PD market include Israeli Teva Pharmaceuticals' (TEVA  -  Free Report) Azilect, Belgium-based UCB SA’s Neupro and Swiss giant Novartis' (NVS  -  Free Report) Stalevo. Most of these are levodopa-based. However, loss of patent exclusivity of all these products is hurting the drugs’ sales.What’s in the PipelineMany companies are trying to develop and introduce Parkinson’s disease treatments to the market. These include Acorda Therapeutics’s Inbrija, Prothena Corporation’s PRX002, AstraZeneca’s MEDI1341, Edison Pharma’s Vatiquinone, Prexton Therapeutics’ Foliglurax and Prana Biotechnology’s PBT434.Notably, Acorda’s Inbrija is likely to first hit the market with the FDA expected to respond to the company’s resubmission of new drug application (NDA) in December 2017, within 74 days and also permits a full review in February 2018.To be diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease is a life-changing affair. Apart from a costly treatment, the disease substantially degrades one’s quality of life and the capacity to carry on with daily activities. The severity of Parkinson’s stretches to such an extent that 37% patients with this disorder are forced to retire earlier than those unaffected.Moreover, lack of curative therapies in this particular area is increasing the need for a better treatment option. Therefore the market opportunity to bring in innovative products to this space is huge, attracting more players in the process to come up with improved treatment choices to cater to the widely gaping unmet need.Many biopharmaceutical companies are implementing the latest knowhow and technologies to improve treatment options for Parkinson’s. Therefore this space is projected as a vital platform with lot of updates awaited in the near term.Medical Sector 5YR % Return Medical Sector 5 YR % ReturnWall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2075,PFE,"2017 was an eventful year for pharma and biotech stocks. Although the industry faced challenges like drug pricing scrutiny, pricing pressure, increasing competition, concerns regarding Amazon’s interest in entering the healthcare arena, fewer-than-expected acquisition deals and major pipeline setbacks, there were some positive developments as well. There was a significant surge in FDA approvals, investors appeared more comfortable with the drug pricing controversy and innovation won the day with the FDA granting approval to gene therapies for cancer as well as a rare form of blindness. Tax reforms are also expected to work in the sector’s favor with mergers and acquisitions (M&As) expected to pick up in the coming quarters.Keeping this in mind, here is a look at key takeaways from presentations made by four major pharma and biotech stocks at the annual J.P. Morgan healthcare conference, the largest and most informative healthcare investment symposium in the industry.Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report): Pharmaceutical giant, Pfizer, expects 2018 to be a rich data delivery year. The company’s focus is on five therapeutic areas including oncology, inflammation & immunology, vaccines and rare disease & internal medicines. Within the immuno-oncology portfolio, focus remains mainly on drug combinations of Bavencio with a variety of Pfizer-targeted agents.During the first half of the year, the company should present late-stage data on Bavencio (second-line non-small cell lung cancer) and Vyndaqel (cardiomyopathy) while regulatory submissions are expected for Xtandi (non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer) and PARP inhibitor, talazoparib (breast cancer). The second half of the year will see the company presenting phase III data on rivipansel (sickle cell) and tanezumab (pain). The company also has a couple of PDUFA dates in 2018 – Xeljanz for ulcerative colitis (its first indication outside rheumatology) and lorlatinib (second-line non-small cell lung cancer).Pfizer is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. The company’s shares are up 11.1% over the last one year compared to the 18.4% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to.Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report): Biotech company, Celgene, announced its preliminary results as well as 2018 outlook at the healthcare conference. Celgene will also be presenting a significant amount of data this year including on Revlimid + Rituxan (relapsed and/or refractory follicular lymphoma) and Otezla for scalp psoriasis. Several study initiations are also expected this year. Moreover, the company expects to submit a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the FDA for Revlimid in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone (RVd) in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (“NDMM”), a New Drug Application (“NDA”) for fedratinib in myelofibrosis and an sNDA for Otezla in Behçet's disease. Meanwhile, FDA decisions are expected this year for ozanimod (relapsing multiple sclerosis - RMS) and a once-daily formulation of Otezla. The company said it will continue to invest in business development.Celgene is a Zacks Rank #3 stock – the company’s shares are down 10.1% over the last one year compared to the 0.9% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report): Bristol-Myers’s pipeline represents several opportunities for long-term growth. The company provided an update on its blockbuster drug, Opdivo, which is expected to drive near- and mid-term growth. Non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”), hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric cancer are some areas that represent commercial potential in excess of $1 billion each. These are disease areas with high prevalence, high unmet medical need and low survival rates. Bristol-Myers has several data-readouts on Opdivo planned for 2018 and 2019. The company’s immuno-oncology portfolio has several early-stage candidates and late-stage assets like relatlimab (anti-LAG3) and BMS-986205 (BMS-IDO). The company said that business development remains an important priority with the focus being on deals that make sense from a financial perspective and where the assets and technologies are strategically aligned to its priorities and are potentially transformational.  Bristol-Myers is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. The company’s shares are up 9.1% over the last one year.Merck (MRK  -  Free Report): For Merck too, business development remains a key priority. The company said that it is looking at opportunities through licensing deals and bolt-on acquisitions to add drugs/technology that address unmet medical needs. While Merck will provide its 2018 outlook in February, the company said that headwinds remain in the form of competitive pressure for drugs like Zostavax and Zepatier while Zetia and Vytorin will still feel the impact of generic competition. However, Keytruda represents significant growth opportunity with the drug being in several studies for label expansion and combination use. Moreover, the company’s pipeline of oncology assets, novel vaccines, select hospital and specialty products also provide scope for long-term growth.Merck is also a Zacks Rank #3 stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

2076,PFE,"Although the ‘Dogs of the Dow’ strategy has a history of outperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average over the long term, it lagged in 2017, returning just 19% compared with 25% gains for the blue-chip index. Before 2017, the Dogs had generated outsized returns in six of the seven previous years, missing only in 2012.The ‘Dogs of the Dow’ represents the 10 highest-yielding blue chip companies of the Dow Jones Industrial Average that are out of favor with the markets and thus have higher dividend yields (due to depressed stock prices). High dividend yields suggest that these stocks are in the oversold territory and will rebound faster than any other stock when the fundamentals changes. As such, the strategy combines both the elements of dividend and value investing.Given this, honing in on stocks that are cheaper than their peers and unlikely to cut dividends could generate above-market returns and lead to juicy yields. In fact, the new tax legislation will act as the biggest catalyst to these stocks, as it would lead to dividend hikes, thereby resulting in higher shareholder returns (read: 4 Sector ETFs & Stocks Set to Explode Higher on Tax Cuts).Let’s meet this year’s Dogs of the Dow.Dogs of the DowWhile eight of the 2017 Dogs of the Dow — Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report), International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report), Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Exxon Mobil XOM, Chevron CVX, Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), Coca Cola (KO  -  Free Report) and Cisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report) — are on the list, the astounding performance of Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Caterpillar CAT led to their departure. These two have been replaced by Procter & Gamble PG and General Electric (GE  -  Free Report). Investors should note that GE is an unusual inclusion in the Dogs given that it cuts its dividend in late 2017 (read: Steer Clear of GE, Bet on These Industrial ETFs Instead).The Dogs of the Dow could lead this year given that a recovery in oil and natural gas prices could spur outperformance in the two integrated oil giants. Both XOM and CVX are up 3.7% and 2.1%, respectively, to start the year. Additionally, General Electric – the biggest laggard last year – has turned into one of the hottest stock to start the year. The stock logged in the biggest weekly percentage gain since Nov 2016 in the first week of the New Year.However, the performance of the Dow Dogs differs from bull to bear markets and great caution needs to be exercised while investing in these companies. Still, those looking to invest in these stocks could do so in the basket form via ETFs with lower risk. Below, we have highlighted five ETFs with heavy exposure to the Dogs of the Dow that look exciting for 2018.ETF BetsELEMENTS DJ High Yield Select 10 ETN (DOD  -  Free Report)This is an ETN option and provides investors pure play to the 10 highest dividend-yielding securities in Dow Jones Industrial Average in equal proportions. It tracks the Dow Jones High Yield Select 10 Total Return Index and charges 75 bps in annual fees. The note has only $38.2 million in AUM while trades in a light volume of around 10,000 shares on an average daily basis. DOD shed 7.2% to start the New Year.ALPS Sector Dividend Dogs ETF (SDOG  -  Free Report)This fund applies the ‘Dogs of the Dow Theory’ on a sector-by-sector basis using the S&P 500. This could be easily done by selecting the five highest yielding securities in each of the 10 GICS sectors and equally weighing them. These higher yielding stocks will appreciate in order to bring their yields in line with the market, potentially leading to outsized gains. The approach results in a portfolio of 50 stocks with each security accounting for no more than 2.35% of total assets. The fund has accumulated $2.4 billion in its asset base and trades in a good volume of more than 146,000 shares. It charges 40 bps in annual fees and has gained 2.6% in the first few trading sessions of 2018.Guggenheim Dow Jones Industrial Average Dividend ETF DJDThe fund offers an alternative, strategic beta approach to the Dow Jones Industrial Average by weighting each security by dividend yield, rather than price. It follows the Dow Jones Industrial Average Yield Weighted index, holding all the 30 Dow stocks in its basket. The 10 Dogs account for 44.2% of the portfolio. The product charges 30 bps in annual fees from investors and has amassed $13.9 million in its asset base. It trades in a paltry volume of 5,000 shares a day on average and has added 2% so far this year (read: DOW ETFs: More Upside Ahead?).   iShares Core High Dividend ETF (HDV  -  Free Report)This product provides exposure to 74 dividend stocks by tracking the Morningstar Dividend Yield Focus Index. The nine Dogs of the Dow account for 46.4% of the portfolio, suggesting that the Dogs dominate the returns of the fund. HDV is among the largest and most popular ETFs in the large-cap space with AUM of about $6.8 billion and average trading volume of around 262,000 shares. It charges 8 bps in fees per year and has added 0.6% in the first few trading sessions of 2018.First Trust Morningstar Dividend Leaders Index Fund (FDL  -  Free Report)With AUM of $1.7 billion, the fund follows the Morningstar Dividend Leaders Index. In total, it holds 97 stocks that have shown dividend consistency and sustainability with nine Dogs of the Dow collectively accounting for 48.8% of assets. Volume is good as it exchanges nearly 173,000 shares a day on average while the expense ratio comes in at 0.45%. The fund is up 1% so far this year (read: 6 Dividend ETFs of 2017 With At Least 3% Yield & 17% Gains).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

2077,PFE,"Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Japanese partner Easai Co., Ltd announced that the FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation (“BTD”) to the combination regimen of Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, and Easai’s multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Lenvima.The companies are developing the combination as a potential treatment for advanced and/or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”) or kidney cancer.This is the 12th BTD for Keytruda and second for Lenvima.The designation aims to expedite the development and review of drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and provide patients access to these as soon as possible.Merck’s shares have decreased 5.2% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 16.8% during that period.The FDA granted the BTD to the combination regimen based on data from the RCC arm of the open label phase Ib/II study, Study 111, which is currently evaluating Keytruda+Lenvima in six cancer indications.While Keytruda is Merck’s blockbuster immunotherapy drug approved for several cancer indications, Easai’s Lenvima is approved as a single agent for treating differentiated thyroid cancer and in combination with Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) chemo drug, Afinitor (everolimus), for advanced RCC following one prior anti-angiogenic therapy.Apart from Lenvima, Merck has collaborated with several companies including Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report), Incyte, Glaxo and Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) separately for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens.Merck & Company, Inc.

2078,PFE,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation to its late-stage pipeline candidate, erdafitinib for the treatment of urothelial cancer, a type of bladder cancer.The designation from the FDA is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs with early evidence of substantial potential clinical benefit to patients, or benefit patients without current treatment options.The designation for erdafitinib was primarily based on efficacy findings from a phase II study, evaluating it in advanced urothelial cancer indication and showed an overall response rate of 42%.J&J stock declined 4.2% this year so far, which compares unfavorably with a gain of 0.9% recorded by the industry.Urothelial cancer, which starts in the urothelial cells that line the inside of the bladder, is usually characterized by serious outcomes due to the often rapid progression of the tumor and the lack of efficacious treatments. It is the sixth most common form of cancer in the United States. It is estimated that more than 81,000 new cases of bladder cancer will be diagnosed this year, per a J&J press release.J&J has a robust pipeline. The company expects to launch or file for approval more than 10 new blockbuster products by 2021. The company is targeting more than 50 line extensions of existing and new drugs as well. This should help lessen the impact of genericization of key products in the pharma portfolio.Key late-stage candidates in the company’s pipeline include esketamine (treatment-resistant depression), niraparib (prostate cancer), and imetelstat (myelofibrosis) among others. While a regulatory filing in the United States for esketamine is expected in 2018 that for niraparibis expected next year. Please note that imetelstat is being developed in partnership with Geron Corporation (GERN  -  Free Report).An important new drug, Guselkumab/Tremfya was approved last year wasfor plaque psoriasis. Also,the first dual treatment for HIV, Juluca (dolutegravir + rilpivirine) received approval in the United States in November last year while the candidate is under review in the EU. Juluca has been developed by J&J in partnership with ViiV Healthcare, an HIV company majorly owned by Glaxo (GSK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report).Meanwhile, Symtuza, a darunavir-based once-daily single-tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV is under review in the United States. Symtuza was approved in the EU in September last year.J&J carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2079,PFE,"Tuesday, January 30, 2018Stock market futures are down pretty deeply into the red this morning, after an average close on the main indexes of roughly half a percentage point. However, no blame can be placed on Q4 earnings season, which continues to bring about robust results from companies across the spectrum of industries. Asian markets were down slightly overnight, and later this evening we await President Trump’s initial State of the Union address. Later this week, beginning tomorrow, we start to see new data on January jobs numbers.Keeping with Q4 earnings results, here are 4 leaders in their respective spaces and how well they have performed relative to expectations, particularly the Zacks consensus estimates:McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) posted strong quarterly numbers both on top- and bottom-lines ahead of the opening bell today. Earnings of $1.71 per share easily outpaced the $1.59 expected. Revenues reached $5.34 billion in the company’s Q4, ahead of the $5.26 billion in the Zacks consensus.Beating estimates is nothing new for McDonald’s, whose previous average positive earnings surprise over the past 4 quarters was over 5%. In the quarter just reported, McDonald’s benefited from stronger comps, up 5.5% year over year. For more on MCD’s earnings, click here.Big Pharma player Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) also beat estimates on both earnings and revenues, with 62 cents per share on $13.70 billion in sales topping the 56 cents and $13.61 billion expected, respectively. Earnings growth year over year was a nice 32%, while revenues were up 1%. Revenue guidance for full-year 2018 remains in range of the current Zacks consensus estimate, whereas earnings guidance of between $2.90-3.00 per share is out ahead of the $2.77 we had earlier expected. For more on PFE’s earnings, click here.Health insurance major Aetna (AET  -  Free Report), on the other hand, posted mixed results for its Q4, with $1.23 per share surpassing the $1.18 we were looking for, but revenues of $14.74 billion lower than the $14.89 billion expected, and down further from the $15.72 billion a year ago. Enrollment is down as Congress continues to chip away at the Affordable Care Act, which was good for Aetna: the previous 4 quarters generated an average 23% positive earnings surprise. For more on AET’s earnings, click here.Global asset management firm T. Rowe Price (TROW  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, also posted earnings and revenue beats for its Q4 report: $1.52 per share outperformed the Zacks consensus by 7 cents, while the $1.29 billion in revenues did better than the $1.27 billion estimated and the $1.09 billion in the year-ago quarter. Bottom-line earnings provided a bigger surprise than the previous 4 quarters’ +1.53% average.

2080,PFE,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of 62 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents by 10.7%. Earnings also rose 32% year over year driven by higher international sales and lower costs and share count.The pharma heavyweight delivered revenues of $13.70 billion, which also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.61 billion. Revenues rose 1% from the year-ago quarter on a reported basis. On an operational basis, revenues were flat year over year.Sales in DetailCurrency movement benefited Pfizer’s fourth-quarter revenues by 1%. In February 2017, Pfizer divested its Hospira infusion systems (HIS) business to ICU Medical. Excluding currency headwinds and HIS revenues in the prior-year quarter, sales rose 2% operationally.Strong performance of newer products like Ibrance (breast cancer), Xtandi (prostate cancer) and Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis) somewhat offset lower sales of Enbrel and Viagra, loss of exclusivity for some products and supply shortages in legacy Hospira products.International revenues rose 5% (up 4% an operational basis) to $7.19 billion. Meanwhile, U.S. revenues declined 4% to $6.51 billion.Segment DiscussionPfizer’s reporting segments are Pfizer Innovative Health (IH) and Pfizer Essential Health (EH).Pfizer IH sales grew 6% on a reported basis (up 5% an operational basis) from the year-ago period to $8.22 billion. Pfizer IH revenues were driven by persistently strong momentum of Eliquis globally and Xeljanz Lyrica, Ibrance and Chantix/Champix, all primarily in the United States.Ibrance revenues rose 11% to $716 million in the quarter driven by strong U.S. revenues. However, Ibrance sales were softer than the prior quarter as a one-time price adjustment hurt international sales.Xeljanz sales rose 47% to $410 million. Lyrica sales rose 8% to $1.13 billion. Eliquis alliance revenues and direct sales rose 43% to $710 million. Chantix sales rose 28% to $271 million in the quarter.Revenues from the blockbuster prostate cancer drug, Xtandi, added to Pfizer’s portfolio following the September 2016 Medivation acquisition, also contributed to U.S. revenues. Xtandi recorded alliance revenues of $168 million in the quarter compared with $150 million in the third quarter.This was partially offset by continued decline in revenues from Prevnar 13 in the United States and lower revenues of Enbrel and Viagra.Enbrel revenues declined 13% to $634 million in key European markets due to biosimilar competition. Pfizer has exclusive rights to Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis(RA) drug, Enbrel, outside the United States and Canada. Total Viagra (IH+EH) sales declined 46% to $209 million due to generic competition that began in December 2017.Global Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 revenues rose 7% to $1.53 billion as higher international sales made up for the decline in the United States. Prevnar 13 revenues tanked 7% in the United States due to continued decline in revenues for the eligible adult patient population. However, Prevenar 13 revenues rose 27% in international markets due to favorable timing of government purchases in some emerging markets for the pediatric indication.Consumer Healthcare revenues declined 2% to $950 million. Global Oncology revenues increased 10% to $1.51 billion. Global Vaccine revenues rose 7% to $1.62 billion. Internal Medicine rose 6% to $2.44 billion. The Inflammation & Immunology franchise rose 6% to $1.10 billion. Additionally, the portfolio of Rare Disease declined 2% to $603 million.Pfizer is exploring strategic alternatives for its Consumer Healthcare segment including a partial or a full separation through a spin-off, sale or other transaction. A decision is expected this year, which could also be to retain the business.Pfizer EH segment sales recorded a decline of 7% (down 8% operationally) to $5.48 billion. Excluding HIS revenues, EH sales declined 3%.EH revenues were hurt by the loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for products, primarily Pristiq in the United States and Lyrica in Europe, lower revenues from legacy Hospira products due to product shortages and divesture of HIS. However, in the EH business, biosimilars and emerging markets did well in the quarter. Biosimilars revenues rose 72% operationally while emerging markets revenues grew 10% operationally.Pfizer launched Inflectra, a biosimilar version of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) blockbuster RA drug Remicade, in November last year. While Inflectra recorded sales of $44 million in the United States and $135 million globally, all other biosimilars brought in sales of $30 million (down 7%) from outside the U.S. markets.Adjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI&A) expenses declined 3% (operationally) in the quarter to $4.32 billion. Adjusted R&D expenses also declined 9% to $2.3 billion.2017 ResultsFull-year sales were $52.55 billion, flat year over year on an operational basis. Sales marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $52.50 billion and were in line with the guidance range of $52.4 billion to $53.1 billion.Adjusted earnings of $2.65 per share for the full year exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.60 as well as the guided range of $2.58 - $2.62. Earnings rose 11% year over year.2018 GuidanceRevenues are expected in the range of $53.5 billion to $55.5 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $53.72 billion.Adjusted earnings per share are expected in the range of $2.90 - $3.00, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.77 per share.At the mid-point, adjusted EPS is expected to increase 11% while revenues are expected to increase 4%.Research and development expenses are expected in the range of $7.4–$7.9 billion while SI&A spending is projected in the range of $14.0–$15.0 billion.Adjusted tax rate is expected to be 17% in 2018.Our TakePfizer’s fourth-quarter results were above expectations as it beat estimates for both earnings and revenues. Meanwhile, it issued an upbeat guidance for 2018. Also Pfizer said that it plans to invest approximately $5 billion in capital projects in the United States over the next five years on increased access to foreign cash following the U.S. tax reforms.However, after initial gains, shares of Pfizer fell around 1.9% in premarket trading. We believe that lower sales in the United States and a sequentially softer performance of Ibrance in the quarter hurt investor sentiment. In the past year, Pfizer’s shares have increased 24.6%, comparing unfavorably with an increase of 29% for the industry.Despite top-line headwinds in the form of genericization of key drugs, supply shortages in legacy Hospira products, pricing pressure and rising competition, Pfizer achieved 11% adjusted earnings growth in 2017. New products like Ibrance, contribution from acquisitions, cost-cutting efforts, a lower tax rate and share buybacks helped the company achieve its 2017 guidance. Meanwhile, Pfizer looks well poised to record profit growth in 2018.Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2081,PFE,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that a phase III study evaluating its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda as monotherapy for the treatment of high-risk melanoma met the primary endpoint of recurrence-free survival (RFS).Keytruda is already approved for many types of cancers and treatment settings including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma and bladder cancer.Interim data from the KEYNOTE-054 study showed that treatment with Keytruda, as an adjuvant therapy in surgically resected high-risk melanoma patients, led to significantly improved RFS compared to placebo. In other words, Keytruda showed the potential to extend the duration before the disease recurs in high-risk melanoma patients.The study will continue to evaluate other key endpoints, including overall survival. Results from the study will be submitted to regulatory authorities and also be presented at a future medical meeting.Merck is conducting the study in collaboration with The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC).Shares of Merck have declined 5.4% in the past year against the industry's surge of 16.9%.Keytruda, the second-largest product in the Merck portfolio, is a key top line driver for Merck. In fact, Keytruda is continuously growing and expanding into new indications and markets globally. The Keytruda development program also significantly advanced in 2017 with several key regulatory approvals, which should further drive sales in 2018.Keytruda is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer in more than 550 studies, including over 300 combination studies. Merck is collaborating with several companies including Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report), Incyte, Glaxo (GSK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) separately for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens.In another press release, Merck announced that the FDA has accepted the new drug application (NDA) for its investigational candidate, doravirine, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.Merck is looking to get doravirine approved as a once-daily single tablet in combination with other antiretroviral agents and also as a once-daily fixed-dose combination regimen containing doravirine, lamivudine (3TC) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) (DOR/3TC/TDF). The FDA is expected to give its decision on both the applications on Oct 23, 2018.Merck carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2082,PFE,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) and partner Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) announced that they will expand their investment for the development of the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody, cemiplimab, in oncology and label expansion of the IL-4/IL-13 pathway-blocking antibody, dupilumab, in Type II allergic diseases.Per the terms of the expansion, the investment in cemiplimab will be increased to $1.64 billion,  an increase of about $1 billion, over the initial 2015 agreement. Meanwhile, Sanofi and Regeneron will continue to equally fund cemiplimab development. Currently, the companies are developing cemiplimab as monotherapy and in combination with other therapies for a wide range of cancers including advanced skin cancers, non-small cell lung cancer, cervical cancer and lymphomas, with more studies in other indications planned to begin in 2018. In the first quarter of 2018, Sanofi and Regeneron expect to submit regulatory filings in the United States and Europe for cemiplimab in advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.   The increased investment in the label expansion of dupilumab development program will enable the companies to speed up the planned new studies in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), peanut allergy and grass allergy as well as in patients who have multiple allergic conditions. The new funding will also support the acceleration and expansion of development of REGN3500, an IL-33 antibody, in atopic dermatitis, asthma and COPD.Shares of Regeneron have increased 5% against the industry’s decline of 2.8% in the past one year.Regeneron has agreed to a limited waiver of the ""lock-up"" clause with Sanofi, thereby enabling the latter to sell a small percentage of the Regeneroncommon stock it owns to fund a portion of the increased investment. Specifically, Sanofi will be allowed to sell up to 1.4 million shares of Regeneroncommon stock to the latter through the end of 2020. This represents about 6% of the 23.9 million shares of Regeneron Sanofi currently owns.If Regeneron opts out of the deal, Sanofi may sell them in the open market.In a separate release, the company also announced collaborations with AbbVie, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY  -  Free Report), AstraZeneca, Biogen and Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) that will speed its effort to collect genetic information on 500,000 people in the UK Biobank database, a project that could help speed up new drug discovery and improve approval success rates.The collaborators will each commit $10 million to enable the speeding up of sequencing timelines and additional companies are considering joining the consortium. It was originally planned that sequencing of all 500,000 samples in the UK Biobank would be completed by 2022. But with the inclusion of these companies, it will be possible to complete the exome sequencing of all 500,000 participants by the end of 2019, with all data made broadly available by UK Biobank to researchers by the end of 2020.This consortium effort thus largely accelerates delivery to the global scientific community of the largest 'big data' resource linking human sequence data to other health-related information. Sequencing of UK Biobank's samples will continue to be performed at the Regeneron Genetics Center (RGC) facility, one of the world's largest and most sophisticated human genetics sequencing centers.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

2083,PFE,"The Alzheimer’s disease (“AD”) area is in focus once again with Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) saying that it will be dropping its plans to develop treatments for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. According to news sources, Pfizer expects its decision to result in the elimination of 300 positions from the neuroscience discovery and early development programs. We expect additional details to be available at the company’s presentation at the 36th Annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference today.Pfizer has had a long association with the Alzheimer’s disease research area. In 2015, the company became a part of the Dementia Discovery Fund, which was formed to speed up the development of new treatments for neurological diseases by bringing together major pharma companies, the UK government and Alzheimer’s Research UK. The Fund is involved in the financing of new, early stage drug development projects.However, Alzheimer’s has always been a highly challenging area with not much progress being made despite the investment of a lot of funds and resources. In fact, Pfizer itself had faced a major setback way back in 2012 in its development efforts for an Alzheimer’s disease treatment. The company and its partner, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), decided to discontinue the development of bapineuzumab IV following a late-stage failure.Other companies like Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) have also stumbled in their efforts to develop treatments for Alzheimer’s. Lilly decided in November 2016 that it would not seek approval for its investigational AD treatment, solanezumab, following disappointing results from a late-stage study. The candidate was being evaluated to see whether it can slow the progression of memory problems associated with amyloid, a protein that forms plaques in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s.Meanwhile, the evaluation of Merck’s investigational Alzheimer’s disease treatment, verubecestat, was halted in a phase II/III study (EPOCH) in February 2017 based on an interim analysis by an external Data Monitoring Committee (eDMC) that the study might fail. Another study is ongoing with results expected in February 2019.Biogen also suffered a setback recently when an Independent Data Monitoring Committee said that BAN2401 did not meet the criteria for success based on a Bayesian analysis at 12 months as the primary endpoint in the phase II study. The failure to show an early positive result came as a major disappointment for Biogen which is developing the candidate in association with Eisai.Clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Axovant Sciences (AXON  -  Free Report) suffered a major setback in September 2017 when its investigational Alzheimer’s disease candidate failed to meet the co-primary efficacy endpoints in a late-stage study. The company decided to discontinue development of the 35 mg dose for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Over the last one year, the company’s shares are down 59.7% compared to the 1.7% decline of the industry it belongs to.According to the Alzheimer's Association, in the 10 years from 2002-2012, 244 drugs were tested for Alzheimer’s in studies registered with clinicaltrials.gov out of which only one succeeded and went on to gain FDA approval.The Road AheadDespite all these setbacks, several companies continue to invest heavily in developing Alzheimer’s disease treatments given the high commercial potential in this market. Success in this area means huge returns considering more than five million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease with the numbers expected to triple by 2050 (Data: Alzheimer's Association). It is considered to be one of the biggest burdens of society and is the sixth leading cause of death across all ages in the United States. The market has immense commercial potential and companies coming out with new treatments could rake in billions of dollars in sales.Companies that are currently working on Alzheimer’s disease treatments include Biogen, Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), AstraZeneca, Eisai and Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report). Biogen’s aducanumab is one of the most important candidates in the company’s pipeline with the candidate currently in a couple of late-stage studies. Biogen is also working on elenbecestat (E2609), a BACE inhibitor in a phase III program. These candidates are being developed in collaboration with Eisai.  Lilly also has quite a few Alzheimer’s disease candidates in its pipeline including lanabecestat, which is being developed in collaboration with AstraZeneca with data readout expected in 2019. Meanwhile, Novartis and Amgen are collaborating for BACE1 inhibitor, CNP520, which has fast track status in the United Status.

2084,PFE,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) announced data from the phase II KEYNOTE-224 study evaluating the use of its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-a form of liver cancer, who were previously treated with systemic therapy (sorafenib). The data showed that treatment with Keytruda monotherapy led to an overall response rate (ORR) of 16.3%. The data also showed complete response rate of 1% and a partial response rate of 15.4% on treatment with KeytrudaThe data also included six-month overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates. The median PFS in the Keytruda arm was 4.8 months with a six-month PFS rate of 43.1 percent. However, the data showed that the median OS was not reached at the time of analysis and the six-month OS rate was 77.9%.The data was presented presented at the 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology Gastrointestinal (ASCO GI) Cancers Symposium in San Francisco. Notably, Keytruda is already marketed for several cancer indications, including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical hodgkin lymphoma and bladder cancer.Last week, Merck announced that Keytruda, in combination with Lilly’s  (LLY  -  Free Report) Alimta (pemetrexed) and acisplatin or carboplatin, met dual primary endpoints in a phase III KEYNOTE-189 study. The combination was evaluated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC. The study met both its primary endpoints, progression-free survival (PFS) and OS (co-primary endpoint).We remind investors at the third quarter 2017 call, Merck had mentioned that it is including the overall survival (OS) as a co-primary endpoint in the KEYNOTE-189 study, which could defer the readout from the study to 2019. It was then estimated that the study would complete in February 2019 Therefore the one year earlier than expected positive read out of KEYNOTE-189 study was a big boost to the company.Shares of Merck have lost 0.9% in the past one year compared unfavorably with the industry’s 23.9% increase. We remind investors that Keytruda is a key top-line driver for Merck and it brought in $1.5 billion sales in third-quarter 2017, up 18.8% sequentially and 194% year over year. Sales continue to be driven by a launch of new indications globally.Significantly, Keytruda sales in the United States have gained particularly from a strong momentum in the new indication of first-line lung cancer. Meanwhile, the Keytruda development program also significantly advanced in 2017 with regulatory approvals for four new indications in the United States and two additional diseases in Europe.Keytruda is continuously growing and expanding into new indications and markets globally. It is under trial for more than 30 types of cancer in above 650 studies including excess of 300 combination studies.Merck is collaborating separately with several companies namely Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report)  Incyte, Glaxo and Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens. Merck & Company, Inc. Price  Merck & Company, Inc.

2085,PFE,"Gilead Sciences’ (GILD  -  Free Report) subsidiary Kite announced that it has entered into a collaboration with Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) to evaluate a combination of its newly approved CAR-T therapy Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) and Pfizer's utomilumab, a 4-1BB agonist, for refractory large B-cell lymphoma.A phase I/II study is expected to begin in 2018 and will be sponsored by Kite. The results of the study will be used to find options for further development of this combination, or similar combinations between Kite’s engineered T-cell products and utomilumab.Gilead’s stock has increased 13.4% in the year so far, compared with the industry’s 3.8% gain. Yescarta was approved in October 2017 as the second (CAR) T cell therapy to get FDA approval. The first CAR-T therapy — Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah received approval by the FDA in August 2017. Yescarta is the first CAR-T therapy indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy.Pfizer is developing utomilumab, also known as PF-05082566, in both hematologic cancers and solid tumors as a single agent and in combination with other anti-cancer therapies.We remind investors that Kite was acquired by Gilead in October 2017. Kite was a pioneer in cell therapy, having developed engineered cell therapies that express either a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or an engineered T-cell receptor (TCR), depending on the type of cancer. The acquisition diversified Gilead’s portfolio and positioned the company in a dominant position in cellular therapy space.The CAR-T therapy space has remained in investor focus in 2017, courtesy of immense potential. CAR-T cell therapy is expected to be revolutionary in cancer treatment. Another company that also develops CAR-T therapy is Juno Therapeutics, Inc. , whose most advanced pipeline candidates include JCAR017 and JCAR014. Juno was also in the news recently after reports surfaced that it will be acquired by Celgene Corporation.Another clinical-stage company committed to developing CAR-T therapy is bluebird bio, Inc., whose lead oncology programs, bb2121 and bb21217, are anti-BCMA CAR T programs which are being developed in collaboration with Celgene.Gilead Sciences, Inc.

2086,PFE,"This week, companies like Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) were in the news. While Merck provided data on Keytruda, Novartis was in the news for gaining priority review status for the label expansion of its CAR-T therapy, Kymriah.    Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesMerck’s Keytruda Shines in 1st Line Lung Cancer Study: Merck scored a win this week with its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda (in combination with Alimta (pemetrexed) and cisplatin or carboplatin) meeting the primary endpoints of overall survival (“OS”) and progression-free survival (“PFS”) in a late-stage study for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”). The interim analysis conducted by an independent Data Monitoring Committee showed that the Keytruda combination resulted in significantly longer OS and PFS compared to Alimta plus platinum chemotherapy alone (Read more: Merck Strong on Confirmatory Phase III Lung Cancer Study).Priority Review for Label Expansion of Novartis’s Kymriah: Novartis, the first company to gain FDA approval for a CAR-T therapy, Kymriah, said that the agency has granted priority review to the company’s regulatory application seeking to expand the label of the product. Novartis is looking to get Kymriah approved for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”) who are ineligible for or relapse after autologous stem cell transplant (“ASCT”).Kymriah also got accelerated assessment status from the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) for the treatment of children and young adults with r/r B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (“ALL”) and for adult patients with r/r DLBCL who are ineligible for ASCT (Read more: Novartis sBLA for CAR-T Therapy Kymriah Accepted by FDA).Unfavorable IPR Decision for J&J: J&J suffered a setback this week with the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office (“PTO”) issuing a final written decision in an inter partes review (“IPR”) related to the sole unexpired patent listed as covering the company’s prostate cancer therapy, Zytiga (abiraterone acetate), in the FDA’s Orange Book. Generic drug company Argentum Pharmaceuticals had challenged all claims of the patent, which is due to expire on Aug 24, 2027.J&J issued a statement regarding the PTO’s decision and said that it is evaluating its options for a rehearing and/or an appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Zytiga brought in sales of about $1.8 billion during the first nine months of 2017.Novartis’s Sandoz in Global Partnership with Biocon for Biosimilars: Sandoz, a Novartis division, is entering into a global partnership with Biocon for the development, manufacture and commercialization of multiple biosimilars in immunology and oncology.The companies will share responsibility for end-to-end development, manufacturing and global regulatory approvals for a number of products, and will have a cost and profit share arrangement while commercialization responsibilities will be divided.This partnership will allow both companies to address the next wave of biosimilar opportunities globally. Sandoz and Biocon both have had some success in the biosimilar space. Sandoz’s portfolio includes five biosimilars marketed in various countries across the world. The company is currently seeking FDA approval for its biosimilar version of AbbVie’s blockbuster immunology drug, Humira. The regulatory application for the biosimilar was recently accepted for review by the FDA.Pfizer-Gilead in Clinical Trial Collaboration: Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) has entered into a clinical trial collaboration with Kite, a Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) company, under which the safety and efficacy of Kite’s CAR-T cell therapy, Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), will be evaluated in combination with Pfizer’s utomilumab, a fully humanized 4-1BB agonist monoclonal antibody, in patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma.

2087,PFE,"Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) is one of the most well-known names in the pharmaceutical sector not just for its medicines and vaccines but also for its consumer healthcare products. This New York-based company is well known for products like Prevnar, Lyrica, Lipitor and Celebrex among others.However, like many of its peers, PFE is facing generic competition and pricing pressure for several products. Other than that lost alliance revenues, supply shortages in legacy Hospira products, pricing pressure and rising competition are hurting the top-line.In this scenario, investor focus remains on late-stage pipeline candidates and their commercial potential and performance of new products apart from the usual top-and bottom-line numbers.The pharma giant has a fairly decent record of earnings surprises. The company’s earnings surpassed expectations in three of the last four quarters while missing in one, resulting in an average positive surprise of 0.79%.Pfizer, Inc. Price and Consensus  Pfizer, Inc. Price and Consensus | Pfizer, Inc. QuoteCurrently, PFE has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but that could definitely change following the company’s earnings report which was just released.

2088,PFE,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), a healthcare bellwether, will report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 23, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 5.56%.J&J’s shares have gained 28.7% in the past year, outperforming the 21.9% increase witnessed by the industry it belongs to.Its earnings beat expectations in each of the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 3.12%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderWe believe that strong performance of the pharmaceutical segment as well as positive contribution from acquisitions like Actelion and Abbott Medical Optics should pull up J&J’s top line in the fourth quarter. However, higher investments in product launches may put pressure on profits as in the third quarter.J&J’s domestic Pharma segment sales decelerated in the first half of 2017.  However, sales growth accelerated in the third quarter and we are likely to see a continuation of the positive trend in the fourth quarter and probably in 2018. We believe that new products in all segments, label expansion of drugs like Imbruvica, Xarelto, Stelaraand Darzalex and meaningful contribution from Swiss biotech Actelion, which J&J bought in June 2017 will support the top line.However, biosimilar competition is expected to hurt sales of key arthritis drug, Remicade outside the United States.Two new drugs were approved last year. These include Tremfya (guselkumab) in the United States (July) as well as in the EU (November) for plaque psoriasis and the first dual treatment for HIV, Juluca (dolutegravir + rilpivirine) in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) in the United States (November). Juluca is under review in the EU.Regarding Tremfya, J&J said on the third-quarter conference call that it has been well received by physicians and patients. The drug is likely to contribute to sales in the soon-to-be reported quarter. We expect an update on the commercialization plans of Juluca on the fourth quarter conference call.In the Medical Devices segment, sales will continue to gain mainly from the inclusion of Abbott Medical Optics acquisition. Diabetes Care unit is however expected to remain weak.The hurricanes in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico hurt sales growth in the last reported quarter due to lost surgery days. On the third-quarter call, the company had said that though supply disruptions were not anticipated, it was not clear at that time if the surgical procedures missed in the third quarter could be recovered in the fourth. Some pricing issues in India and system outage in Europe also hurt sales to an extent. It remains to be seen if the issues were resolved this time around.In the Consumer segment, global consumer category slowdown across many of the company’s markets will continue to hurt sales. However, recent acquisitions as well as new products are likely to provide some support.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model does not conclusively show that J&J is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is -0.09%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: J&J’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderA couple of stocks in the large-cap pharma sector that have a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are:Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +0.83% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to release results on Feb 2.Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Jan 30. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.30% and a Zacks Rank #2.

2089,PFE,"Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report) announced an amendment to the protocol for the phase Ib trial of cabozantinib combined with Roche Holdings’ (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Tecentriq in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.Per the amendment, there will be four new expansion cohorts to the trial. The cohorts will include include patients with NSCLC and CRPC, in addition to previously included patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and urothelial carcinoma (UC). The primary objective in the expansion stage of this trial is to determine the objective response rate in each cohort.The cohorts will now include the following patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC without a defined tumor genetic alteration (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, or BRAF) who have not received prior therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors, patients with NSCLC without a defined tumor genetic alteration who have progressed following treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitor, patients with UC who have progressed following treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, patients with CRPC who have previously received enzalutamide and/or abiraterone acetate and experienced radiographic disease progression in soft tissue.The multicentre phase Ib open label study is divided into two parts — a dose-escalation phase and an expansion cohort phase.The main objective is to calculate the optimal dose and schedule of daily oral administration of cabozantinib.  The trial will begin enrolment in the eight expansion cohorts once the recommended dose and schedule are determined (anticipated to occur in the first half of 2018).Exelixis’ stock have rallied a massive 108.2% in the last one year compared with the industry’s gain of 3.8%.In April 2016, a tablet formulation of cabozantinib, Cabometyx, was approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy.Cabometyx delivered strong sales in the first nine months of 2017, underlying the increasing demand for the drug. New patient market share in the second-line plus setting increased to 38%.The recent FDA approval of Cabometyx for the treatment of previously untreated advanced RCC should further boost demand. The drug demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) versus the current standard of care, Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Sutent.Apart from Roche, Exelixis also inked agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) to jointly develop cabozantinib in collaboration with immunotherapy agents. Exelixis collaborated with Bristol-Myers to evaluate cabozantinib in combination with Opdivo alone or along with Yervoy in a phase III trial in first-line RCC, and potentially in other tumor types including (HCC and bladder cancer). The companies have initiated a phase III trial, CheckMate 9ER in July 2017 to evaluate Opdivo in combination with Cabometyx or Opdivo and Yervoy in combination with Cabometyx versus Sutent in patients with previously untreated, advanced or metastatic RCC.While competition might stiffen a bit in 2018 as the the FDA accepted Bristol-Myers’ supplemental Biologics License Application. The application includes priority review of Opdivo plus Yervoy to treat intermediate- and poor-risk patients with advanced RCC with an action date of Apr 16, 2018.

2090,PFE,"The biosimilar space was in focus in 2017 on key FDA approvals.Biosimilars contain a version of the active substance of an already approved original biological drug. Development of biosimilars is technically more challenging than the development of generic drugs as the former requires clinical studies in patients and are engineered to match the reference drug in quality, safety and efficacy. Due to the complex nature of the product, the development and the regulatory pathway of biosimilars differ significantly from that of generics. A biosimilar is usually less expensive than the branded drug. Thus, the market for the same is highly lucrative. With the acceleration in approvals of biosimilars, the market has thus attracted a lot many players which are witnessing rapid growth. Here we go through the progress report for 2017.Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) launched Reneflexis, a biosimilar version of Remicade (infliximab), in the United States in July 2017 after approval in April. The FDA also granted tentative approval for Lusduna Nexvue, the biosimilar version of Lantus, basal insulin in a pre-filled dosing device. Merck currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Remicade has been seeing intense competition in the biosimilars space of late. We note that Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) supplies Inflectra, a biosimilar version of Remicade. Pfizer is a strong player in the biosimilars market. In December 2017, Pfizer got FDA approval for another of its Remicade’s biosimilar, Ixifi, as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, pediatric Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis. The company has a portfolio of three marketed biosimilar medicines outside the United States, including Inflectra, Retacrit (epoetin zeta) and Nivestim (filgrastim) along with a strong pipeline of 13 distinct biosimilar molecules in various stages of development. Pfizer currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Generic leader Mylan NV (MYL  -  Free Report) is also exploring the biosimilars market — that has the potential to grow to $20 billion by 2020. Early last December, Mylan and partner Biocon Ltd. announced the FDA approval of Ogivri (trastuzumab-dkst), a biosimilar version of Herceptin (trastuzumab). Ogivri has been approved for all indications included in the label of the reference product, Herceptin, including the treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer and metastatic stomach cancer. Ogivri is the first FDA-approved biosimilar of Herceptin and the first biosimilar from Mylan and Biocon's joint portfolio. Mylan currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Meanwhile, Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Allergan plc. (AGN  -  Free Report) won FDA approval for the biosimilar version of Avastin in September 2017 for the treatment of multiple types of cancer. We note that Mvasi is the first biosimilar approved in the United States for the treatment of cancer. Amgen’s biosimilar version of Humir, Amjevita, is already approved by the FDA and will be launched in the United States on Jan 31, 2023, after the company resolved litigation with the AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) The companies have also submitted a BLA to the FDA for ABP 980, a biosimilar candidate to Herceptin in July 2017. We note that the companies are collaborating on four oncology biosimilars, including ABP 980, which is the second to be submitted for FDA approval. The companies also submitted a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency for the candidate in 2017. We note that Amgen has a total of 10 biosimilars in its pipeline, two of which have been approved by the FDA. Amgen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Boehringer Ingelheim’s Cyltezo (adalimumab-adbm), another biosimilar of Humira, was also approved by the FDA in August 2017. Medical - Generic Drugs Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Generic Drugs Industry 5YR % ReturnConclusionOwing to the slew of FDA approvals, we expect investors to remain focused on this space in the near future.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

2091,PFE,"The week has been pretty slow with key announcements including Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) job cut announcement and Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) collaboration agreements with companies like Sangamo and Arvinas.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesAllergan Announces Job Cuts: At the time of announcing third quarter results in November, Allergan had said that it would have to look at cost reduction in order to deal with the impact of loss of exclusivity (“LOE”) on key products including Restasis. This week, the company announced a cost cutting and restructuring program which will lead to the elimination of more than 1,000 currently filled positions, primarily in commercial and other functions. About 400 open positions will also be eliminated. Restructuring costs of about $125 million, primarily due to severance, will be recorded mostly in the fourth quarter of 2017 with overall operating expense savings expected in the range of $300 to $400 million compared to 2017. The company expects to achieve additional cost reductions through non-headcount spending rationalization (Read more: Allergan to Cut Jobs Amid Loss of Exclusivity for Key Drugs).Pfizer in Protein Degradation Deal with Arvinas: Pfizer has agreed to shell out up to $830 million to private biotech company, Arvinas, which is focused on creating a new class of drugs based on protein degradation.

2092,PFE,"AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) shares jumped 13.8% following the release of better-than-expected fourth quarter 2017 results and an upbeat outlook for 2018. Results were driven by the performance of Humira, Imbruvica and Mavyret. Imbruvica continued to witness strong uptake for the chronic lymphocytic leukemia (“CLL”) indication while Humira’s performance was driven by robust demand despite the introduction of new mechanisms of action and competition from indirect biosimilars. Meanwhile, Mavyret (hepatitis C virus – HCV) has been witnessing strong uptake in both the United States and international markets. Mavyret exited 2017 with a market share of 32% in the United States and is expected to become a major growth driver for the company.Rosy Outlook for 2018: The company provided an upbeat outlook for 2018 reflecting Mavyret’s strong uptake, the continued robust underlying performance from other products, and a lower tax rate thanks to the passage of the U.S. tax reform. AbbVie expects 2018 earnings per share in the range of $7.33 - $7.43 on revenues of almost $32 billion. The mid-point of the earnings guidance range reflects year-over-year growth of 32%, an improvement over the company’s previously provided guidance of 17% growth at the mid-point (provided with third quarter results).Humira sales are expected to grow approximately 13% - 14% in the United States while ex-U.S. sales are expected to be about $6.2 billion. The company expects to record Imbruvica revenues of more than $3.3 billion in 2018. Mavyret sales are expected to cross $2.5 billion. Other products like Venclexta, AndroGel, and Duodopa are expected to record sales of $300 million plus, $475 million, and $458 million, respectively. Creon sales are expected to grow 10% in 2018 while Synagis, Lupron and Synthroid sales are expected to remain flat. Zinbryta sales are expected to come in below $100 million reflecting the impact of competition and label changes.Cash Repatriation/Capital Deployment: The U.S. tax reform will allow AbbVie more efficient access to its foreign cash and the ability to use it in the United States. The company intends to invest about $2.5 billion in capital within the United States in the next five years and is currently evaluating additional expansion of its U.S. facilities. AbbVie also intends to accelerate pension funding by $750 million and enhance non-executive employee compensation. The company is also planning a one-time shareable contribution of about $350 million to select not-for-profit organizations, supporting initiatives such as the Puerto Rico rebuilding efforts, children's healthcare access programs, and certain charities. AbbVie also said that it would be increasing shareholder returns in what could be a combination of acceleration of dividend growth and more share buybacks. Details will be provided later by the company.What about Deals? As far as deals are concerned, the company’s key focus is on opportunities that could drive growth in the 2023-2025 timeframe. AbbVie said that it is looking at early-stage assets.Catalyst Rich 2018: AbbVie’s R&D spend in 2018 is expected to be about 16% of sales, reflecting higher spending to support the late-stage pipeline and mid-stage programs. In addition to working on expanding the label of approved products like Imbruvica and Venclexta, AbbVie’s late-stage pipeline includes candidates like upadacitinib (rheumatoid arthritis – RA, Crohn's disease) and risankizumab (psoriasis, Crohn's disease). AbbVie is looking to file for regulatory approval of risankizumab for the psoriasis indication in the first half of the year while the regulatory filing for upadacitinib for the RA indication is expected in the second half of 2018.Meanwhile, elagolix is under priority review for endometriosis with a response from the FDA expected in the second quarter.AbbVie’s shares are up 103.9% over the last one year, compared to the 29% rally of the industry it belongs to. AbbVie is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

2093,PFE,"We expect Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports fourth-quarter and full year 2017 results on Jan 30, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.08%.The pharma giant has a fairly decent record of earnings surprises. The company’s earnings surpassed expectations in three of the last four quarters while missing in one, resulting in an average positive surprise of 0.79%.Pfizer’s shares have risen 18.7% in the past year, comparing unfavorably with an increase of 24.7% for the industry.Factors at PlayNew products like Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis) and Ibrance (breast cancer) as well as older products like Lyrica (neuropathic pain), Chantix (smoking cessation) and Eliquis (blood thinner) are likely to contribute meaningfully to the top line.However, the loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for some products (primarily Pristiq in the United States and Vfend and Lyrica in developed Europe), supply shortages in legacy Hospira products, and divesture of the Hospira Infusion Systems unit will continue to hamper top-line growth.Blockbuster drug Enbrel’s sales will continue to decline in the quarter due to biosimilar competition. The Prevnar/Prevenar 13 vaccines franchise is likely to see lower sales while lower demand is expected to hurt sales of Viagra.On the third-quarter call, Pfizer said that it is facing supply shortages for products from legacy Hospira portfolio mainly due to capacity constraints and technical issues. At the time of acquiring Hospira in September 2015, Pfizer had estimated that it would take a couple of years to integrate the manufacturing plants and resolve the majority of the supply chain issues. The company also stated that the remediation of the business has taken longer than expected. We expect the supply shortages to hurt sales in the fourth quarter.Meanwhile, the bottom line is likely to be driven by cost savings and share buybacks.Two leukemia treatments - Besponsa/inotuzumab ozogamicin (approved in EU in June 2017 and in the United States in August 2017) for relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Mylotarg for newly diagnosed CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were approved in third-quarter 2017.Xeljanz, Sutent and Bosulif were approved for line extensions in the fourth quarter while Ixifi, Pfizer’s second biosimilar version of Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug Remicade, was also launched in December.All these new products and line extensions should bring in some additional sales in the fourth quarter.We also expect management to update on the commercialization plans for new approved oral SGLT-2 inhibitor, Steglatro (ertugliflozin) tablets on the conference call. Apart from being approved as a monotherapy to treat type II diabetes, Steglatro has also been approved for use in combination with metformin under the brand name, Segluromet and with Januvia, under the brand name Steglujan.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model shows that Pfizer is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is +0.45%. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Pfizer has a Zacks Rank #2. The combination of Pfizer’s Zacks Rank #2 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other health care stocks worth considering per our model. These have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Jan 26. The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.30% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Merck & Co., Inc.

2094,PFE,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced a collaboration with Sangamo Therapeutics Inc. (SGMO  -  Free Report) to develop a gene therapy using the latter’s zinc finger protein transcription factors (ZFP-TFs) platform. The gene therapy will be developed to treat neurodegenerative disorders — amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) — caused by mutations in the C9ORF72.Per the agreement, Sangamo will receive a $12 million upfront payment from Pfizer and will be responsible for the development of ZFP-TF candidates.

2095,PFE,"Achaogen, Inc. (AKAO  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has accepted its new drug application (“NDA”) for its urinary tract infections candidate, plazomicin. The FDA has also granted priority review to the NDA, which will expedite the review process. A decision is expected on Jun 25, 2018.Shares of the company rose 4.3% on Tuesday. However, Achaogen’s stock has underperformed the industry in the past year.  It has declined 24.7% against the industry’s gain of 7.9% in that period.The NDA is seeking approval of plazomicin as a treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), which includes pyelonephritis (inflammation kidney due to bacterial infection) and also for bloodstream infections (“BSI”) in patients who have none or few treatment options available due to multi-drug resistant bacteria.The NDA includes data from two phase III studies – EPIC and CARE – which evaluated the candidate in serious infections caused by gram-negative bacteria that are resistant to multiple antibiotics.Data from the EPIC study showed that plazomicin achieved superior microbiological eradication rates in cUTI and acute pyelonephritis patients compared to Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Merrem. The CARE study evaluated plazomicin versus Colistin in patients with BSI demonstrating lower rate of mortality or serious disease-related complications.Per the press release, at least 70,000 patients are infected with antibiotic resistant infections annually in the United States and the figure is expected to double in the next five years. This represents a significant potential for plazomicin, if approved.In a separate press release, the company announce top-line data from a dose-ranging phase I efficacy study evaluating another antibacterial candidate, C-Scape.

2096,PFE,"Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report) and Ipsen announced positive detailed results from the pivotal phase III CELESTIAL study of Cabometyx (cabozantinib)  demonstrating significant overall survival benefit in patients with previously treated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).CELESTIAL study met its primary endpoint and cabozantinib provided a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement versus placebo in overall survival (OS). The median OS was 10.2 months with Cabometyx compared with 8.0 months with placebo. The Median progression-free survival (PFS) more than doubled, at 5.2 months with Cabometyx compared with 1.9 months with placebo. The trial showed that disease control (partial response or stable disease) was achieved by 64% of the Cabometyx group compared with 33% of the placebo group. The companies plan to present the results at a symposium in San Francisco later this week.We remind investors that Cabometyx is already approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy. In December 2017, the FDA approved label expansion of Cabometyx for the treatment of previously untreated RCC. The approval came on the back of positive results from the randomized phase II, trial CABOSUN on first-line kidney cancer. The results demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS versus Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Sutent.Exelixis’ share price has increased 64.5% over a year compared with the industry’s gain of 2.6%.  HCC is the most common form of liver cancer, accounting for more than 90% of cases in the United States. Hence there is a dire need to bring new treatment options. Exelixis plans to submit a supplemental new drug application to the FDA in the first quarter of 2018.Cabometyx raked in strong sales in the first nine months of 2017, courtesy of the increasing demand for the drug. A potential approval will further boost the sales of the drug. .Exelixis has also initiated a phase Ib study (investigator-sponsored) on Cabometyx (in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo (nivolumab) or Opdivo plus Yervoy) in patients suffering from genitourinary tumors, including bladder cancer and RCC.Exelixis has also inked agreements with Bristol-Myers Squibb and Roche Holding AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) to develop cabozantinib in combination with immunotherapy agents. Exelixis, Inc.

2097,PFE,"Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) stock was up 19% in 2017, which compared favorably with a gain of 2.8% recorded by the industry.Last year’s share price surge was supported by a series of positive news including promising data from several pivotal studies and rapid progress with its pipeline and line extensions.The positive trend is likely to continue this year as well.What Backed the Stock’s Rally in 2017?A few new products were approved last year. While the FDA approved Mvasi -  Amgen and Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) biosimilar version of Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) cancer drug, Avastin - and Parsabiv for secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT), EU approved Amgevita, Amgen’s biosimilar version of Humira,Amgen also gained approval for several line extensions - FDA approval to include a new indication - risk reduction of major cardiovascular events data – on Repatha’s labeland overall survival datafrom the TOWER study on leukemia drug Blincyto’s label; approval for arefined indication for metastatic colorectal cancerdrug Vectibix and EU approval for a pediatric formulation of Mimparafor secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT).The line extensions can expand the eligible patient populations of these drugs and drive their sales higher in future quarters.In 2017, Amgen made several data presentations from studies evaluating line extensions on key marketed products, Repatha and Kyprolis- both with blockbuster potential - and other studies on its pipeline candidates, tezepelumab(asthma) and Evenity(osteoporosis)Factors Likely to Support the Stock in 2018With several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones expected in 2018, the bullish run of the stock is likely to continue.This year, Amgen expects regulatory approval for pipeline candidates, Aimovig/erenumab(prevention of episodic and chronic migraine) and Evenity and label expansion for Prolia and Kyprolis. This month, Amgen already received FDA approval for an expanded patient population for Xgeva - multiple myeloma patients. In the biosimilars portfolio, Amgen expects EU approval for Mvasi and FDA/EU approval for the biosimilar version of Roche’s other cancer drug, Herceptin.Also, Amgen’s newer drugs – Prolia, Xgeva, Vectibix, Nplate and Sensipar – are performing well, a trend expected to continue next year, which should drive sales. Sales of other newer products like Kyprolis, Repatha and Blincyto are expected to pick up in 2018 as they were approved forlabel expansions last year.Besides this, Amgen’s restructuring plan is making it leaner and more cost efficient,which should lend support to the bottom line.Though Amgen faces some challenges, given the presenceof biosimilar competition, slowdown in sales of mature drugs, mainly its blockbuster drug Enbrel, the positives are expected to outweigh the headwinds.Amgen markets Enbrel in partnership with Pfizer, Inc.

2098,PFE,"Pfizer Inc.

The study met its primary endpoint demonstrating equivalence in overall response rate for the first-line treatment of patients with CD20-positive, low tumor burden and follicular lymphoma.This marks Pfizer’s fifth proposed biosimilar monoclonal antibody (mAb), showing positive trial results.Significantly, Pfizer's biosimilar capabilities were substantially boosted by the acquisition of Hospira in 2015. In December 2017, the company launched Ixifi, the second biosimilar version of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report)/Merck & Co., Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug, Remicade, in the United States.We remind investors that Pfizer is evaluating 14 biosimilar molecules in various developmental stages. Incidentally, biosimilar products in late-stage development include the biosimilar versions of Roche's Avastin and AbbVie's Humira. Also, Herceptin’s biosimilar version is under review in the United States as well as the EU.Importantly, Novartis and Teva filed regulatory applications last year in the United States for the biosimilar version of Rituxan in September and June respectively.Pfizer, Inc.

2099,PFE,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) reportedly said in a statement that it will end R&D efforts in the Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease areas, which will result in about 300 layoffs.The decision to end the neuroscience-discovery program will mainly affect employees at facilities in Andover and Cambridge,  MA, and Groton,  CT. Pfizer, however, intends to continue development of pain candidate, tanezumab, which it is developing in late-stage studies in partnership with Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report), label expansion efforts for pain drug Lyrica and its rare disease program.Shares of Pfizer have risen 10.2% in the past year, comparing unfavorably with a 16.5% increase for the industry.The successful development of therapies for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease is challenging and we note that several companies have failed in this regard.In fact Pfizer itself shelved its late-stage Alzheimer’s candidate, bapineuzumab IV after it failed two phase III studies. Pfizer was developing the candidate in collaboration with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Elan Corporation.In November 2016, Lilly’s anti-amyloid candidate solanezumab failed to meet the primary endpoint in a late-stage AD study. Lilly decided to drop the development of solanezumab. Lillyalso suffered a major setback in August 2010, when it had to halt the development of another phase III Alzheimer’s candidate, semagacestat.Last month, Biogen, Inc.

2101,PFE,"We expect AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 26 before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.44%.AbbVie’s shares have soared 73.9% in a year’s time, ahead of the industry’s rally of 24.6%. Notably, AbbVie’s earnings history is quite impressive with the pharmaceuticals company outpacing estimates in three of the last four quarters and meeting the same in one. Overall, AbbVie has an average beat of 1.12%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Factors to ConsiderAbbVie expects fourth-quarter 2017 earnings in the range of $1.42-$1.44 per share. Revenues are estimated to grow approximately 10% on an operational basis. Foreign exchange is anticipated to have a 2% favorable impact on sales in the period to be reported.The company’s key drug, Humira, is likely to remain the growth driver in the fourth quarter, backed by strong demand trends for the drug. AbbVie expects Humira full-year sales growth in the mid to high-teens range while internationally, the metric is projected in a mid-single-digit range on an operational basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Humira is $4.8 billion for the to-be-reported quarter.Significantly, on fourth-quarter conference call, investors’ focus will also be on the performance and label expansion updates of AbbVie’s another cancer drug, Imbruvica. The drug has been recording strong sales since the past few quarters, a trend that we expect to continue even in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Imbruvica is $704 million for the period.Other drugs like Duopa and Creon are also likely to continue to perform well in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.However, AbbVie’s Hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment, Viekira, will continue to see declining sales impacted by an intense pricing and competitive pressure in the HCV market.Notably, AbbVie’s eight-week, pan-genotypic, ribavirin-free, once-daily HCV treatment, Mavyret, gained approval in the United States, EU, Canada and Japan in third-quarter 2017. Mavyret recorded $100 million global sales in the quarter. The initial uptake of the drug has been impressive and we expect its higher sales in the fourth quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that the stock is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.Zacks ESP: AbbViehas an Earnings ESP of +1.30%, representing the difference between the Most Accurate estimate ($1.46 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($1.44).

Meanwhile, Glenmark will be responsible for all costs related to the programs. With the latest deal, Glenmark will also be able to access a technology that includes three separate species in a single license.Notably, this is the first new OmniAb deal to include OmniChicken in addition to OmniRat, OmniMouse and OmniFlic.OmniAb includes three transgenic animal platforms consisting of four different technologies— OmniRat, OmniMouse,OmniFlic and OmniChicken — for producing mono- and bispecific human therapeutic antibodies.Ligand’s shares have gained 39% in a year’s time compared with the industry’s growth of 1.1%.We remind investors that OmniAb, an antibody-generating platform, became a part of Ligand’s technology portfolio following its OMT, Inc. acquisition in January 2016.Ligand is focused on the development and licensing of biopharmaceutical assets.

2104,PFE,"Shares of Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report) have rallied a massive 106.6% year to date compared with the industry’s gain of 5.2%.  Exelixis’ lead product, Cometriq, the capsule form of cabozantinib, was approved in the United State in 2012 for the treatment of progressive, metastatic medullary thyroid cancer. In April 2016, a tablet formulation of cabozantinib, Cabometyx was approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy.Cabometyx posted strong sales in the first nine months of 2017 thereby underlying the increasing demand for the drug. New patient market share in the second-line plus setting increased to 38%.The recent FDA approval of Cabometyx for the treatment previously untreated advanced RCC should further boost demand.The approval comes two months ahead of schedule. We note that Cabometyx (cabozantinib), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or TKI, was already approved for the treatment of RCC in patients who have already received anti-angiogenic therapy. Cabozantinib inhibits the activity of tyrosine kinases, including MET, AXL, VEGF receptors, and RET.  The approval came on the back of results from the randomized phase II, trial CABOSUN. The results demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) versus the current standard of care, Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Sutent. Importantly, Cabometyx demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant 52% reduction in the rate of disease progression or death. Median PFS for Cabometyx was 8.6 months versus 5.3 months for Sutent corresponding to a 3.3 month (62%) improvement.RCC is the most common form of kidney cancer in adults. Per statistics, approximately 30,000 patients in the United States and 68,000 around the world need a first-line treatment for advanced kidney cancer. As many as 14,000 patients need the same annually in the United States.Sutent is widely used as a first-line treatment for RCC. Hence, we expect Cabometyx will pose a challenge to Sutent’s market share for first line RCC in 2018.In addition, the drug is also being evaluated for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the CELESTIAL study. In October 2017, Exelixis announced that the CELESTIAL trial met its primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) with cabozantinib providing a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS compared with placebo in patients with advanced HCC. The independent data monitoring committee for the study recommended that the trial should be stopped for efficacy following review of the second planned interim analysis. Exelixis plans to submit an sNDA to the FDA in the first quarter of 2018. HCC is the most common form of primary liver cancer, accounting for more than 90% of cases in the United States. reflecting the demand for therapies. Hence, a potential approval of the drug for liver cancer will further boost the growth potential of the drug.In early 2017, Exelixis inked agreements with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) and Roche Holdings (RHHBY  -  Free Report) to jointly develop cabozantinib in combination with immunotherapy agents. Exelixis collaborated with Bristol-Myers to evaluate cabozantinib in combination with Opdivo alone or in combination with Yervoy in a phase III trial in first-line RCC, and potentially in other tumor types including (HCC and bladder cancer). Both companies have initiated a phase III trial, CheckMate 9ER in July 2017 to evaluate Opdivo in combination with Cabometyx or Opdivo and Yervoy in combination with Cabometyx versus Sutent in patients with previously untreated, advanced or metastatic RCC. Exelixis has also collaborated with Roche to evaluate Cabometyx in combination with Tecentriq, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, in patients with advanced RCC or bladder cancer. In June 2017, Exelixis initiated the dose-escalation stage of a phase Ib trial of cabozantinib in combination with Tecentriq. The drug will be evaluated in patients suffering from locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma  or RCC.While competition might stiffen up a bit in 2018 as the the FDA accepted Bristol-Myers’ supplemental Biologics License Application for priority review of Opdivo plus Yervoy to treat intermediate- and poor-risk patients with advanced RCC with an action date of Apr 16, 2018, we expect Exelixis to ride high on the performance of Cabometyx in 2018.Hence, this is a must-have stock for investors in their biotech portfolio in 2018.Zacks RankExelixis carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2105,PFE,"With just a few days left for the year to end, it can be said that 2017 turned out to be a pretty good year for the biotech sector. The sector had been struggling due to several issues including the drug pricing controversy, mixed results, slower-than-expected new product launches, increasing competition and pipeline setbacks.However, with investors being more comfortable about the drug pricing controversy this year, the focus is now more on the fundamentals of the sector. New product sales ramp up, R&D success and innovation, and continued strong performance from key products are some of the factors that helped the sector rebound in 2017. The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index is up an impressive 22% year to date.The year also turned out to be pretty good where FDA approvals are concerned. Till date, the regulatory agency has given its nod to 46 novel drugs, well above the 22 drugs approved last year. Immuno-oncology was a key focus area in 2017, whether it was to do with scientific conferences, clinical trial collaborations, acquisitions or FDA approvals.The approval of Novartis’s Kymriah, a gene cell therapy, and Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) Yescarta, a CAR-T (chimeric antigen receptor T cells) cell treatment, ensured that the highly lucrative immuno-oncology market remained in the limelight.The $11.9 billion acquisition of immuno-oncology focused Kite by Gilead also increased interest in this category with investors expecting more acquisition announcements in this area.Of course, it was not all good news for the sector. Companies like Celgene and Biogen were hit by pipeline setbacks while Gilead continues to struggle due to the dwindling sales of its hepatitis C virus (“HCV”) franchise.Nevertheless, there were quite a few companies that fared extremely well in 2017 with their shares outperforming the sector as well as the overall market on the back of factors like deals, pipeline progress and FDA approvals. Here is a look at five such companies.XOMA Corporation (XOMA  -  Free Report): XOMA is focused on the discovery, development and licensing of therapeutic antibodies. The company has several licensing agreements with other biotech and pharma companies which provide XOMA with funds in the form of upfront and milestone payments and potential royalty payments. XOMA’s shares have been on an upward trajectory from August following the signing of licensing agreements with Novartis for gevokizumab and intellectual property covering the use of IL-1 beta targeting antibodies in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. This deal resulted in XOMA receiving upfront payments worth $31 million including an equity investment worth $5 million. The agreement terms also resulted in a 50% reduction in XOMA's outstanding debt through the repayment of its €12 million obligation to Les Laboratoires Servier and the extension of the company’s maturity date for its debt to Novartis by a couple of years. XOMA also stands to earn significant milestone payments and tiered royalties on sales of gevokizumab.Year to date, XOMA’s shares are up 771.8%, significantly outperforming the 3.5% rally of the industry it belongs to. XOMA is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock – you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Dynavax Technologies Corporation (DVAX  -  Free Report): Commercial-stage biopharma company, Dynavax, is focused on the discovery and development of novel vaccines and immuno-oncology therapeutics. The company’s shares shot up in July following a favorable recommendation (12-1) from the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (“VRBPAC”) for Heplisav-B, a vaccine for immunization against hepatitis B infection in adults. Heplisav-B, which had previously received two complete response letters (one in November 2016 and the other in February 2013), from the FDA, gained FDA approval this year in November. The regulatory action makes Heplisav-B the first new hepatitis B vaccine in the United States in more than 25 years and the only two-dose hepatitis B vaccine for adults. Heplisav-B is the first FDA-approved product for the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, which expects to launch the vaccine in the first quarter of 2018. Dynavax’s shares are up a whopping 386.1% year to date.Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. (SGMO  -  Free Report): Clinical-stage biotech company, Sangamo, is focused on translating ground-breaking science into genomic therapies using its platform technologies in genome editing, gene therapy, gene regulation and cell therapy. The company got a shot in the arm earlier this year when it entered into an agreement with Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) for the development and commercialization of gene therapy programs for hemophilia A. The agreement saw Sangamo getting an upfront payment of $70 million with the potential to earn significant milestone payments as well as tiered double-digit royalties on net sales. This deal bodes well for the long-term prospects of the company. The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s shares are up 468.9% year to date.Early next year, Sangamo expects preliminary proof-of-concept data on SB-525 (hemophilia A), SB-FIX (hemophilia B), SB-318 (MPS I) and SB-319 (MPS II). Other value drivers could be the signing of partnership deals for the company’s central nervous system/tau and oncology assets.Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALNY  -  Free Report): RNAi therapeutics company, Alnylam, is focused on rare genetic, cardio-metabolic, and hepatic infectious diseases. The Zacks Rank #3 company has a strong discovery platform and a deep pipeline including four pipeline candidates that are in late-stage development. Alnylam has agreements with companies like Sanofi and Vir Biotechnology. Alnylam’s shares are up 243.4% year to date on the back of pipeline progress during the year.bluebird bio, Inc. (BLUE  -  Free Report): bluebird is a clinical-stage company working on developing lentiviral-based gene therapies for serious genetic diseases and T cell-based immunotherapies for cancer. The company’s pipeline includes Lenti-D, currently in a phase II/III study, for the treatment of cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, and LentiGlobin, currently in five studies for the treatment of transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia and severe sickle cell disease. The company’s lead oncology programs, bb2121 and bb21217, are anti-BCMA CAR T programs which are being developed in collaboration with Celgene.bluebird’s shares have been gaining following the presentation of data at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (“ASCO”) earlier this year in June. Shares shot up further in August when Gilead announced its intention to acquire immuno-oncology focused Kite Pharma. The Gilead-Kite deal has raised hopes for additional acquisition deals in the immuno-oncology therapeutic area with bluebird considered to be an attractive acquisition target. bluebird is also a Zacks Rank #3 stock and its shares are up 191.6% year to date.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2106,PFE,"Shares of Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated (CORT  -  Free Report) has soared 158.8% so far this year, massively outperforming the 9.5% growth registered by the industry. Here we analyze the factors that led to the rally.Corcept’s only marketed drug, Korlym (mifepristone), is approved for the treatment of patients with Cushing's syndrome.The company is striving to commercialize Korlym successfully by deploying medical liaisons and sales representatives. About 10-15 of every 1 million people are newly diagnosed with Cushing’s syndrome each year, which translates to more than 3,000 new patients annually in the United States. Increased awareness among physicians and patients about the drug and expanded sales efforts is likely to bolster sales.Meanwhile, Corcept is currently working on developing the drug for additional indications. It is conducting a phase I/II safety and efficacy study on Korlym in combination with Eisai Co., Ltd.’s anti-cancer drug Halaven for the treatment of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC). Enrolment in the study is complete and the company announced encouraging data in December 2016. We anticipate a successful label expansion of Korlym to boost the top line significantly, as the disease represents huge potential with as many as 40,000 women in the United States being diagnosed every year.The University of Chicago is conducting a phase II study on Korlym, in combination with Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xtandi, for the treatment of metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer. The institution also plans to conduct a phase II study on Korlym, in combination with Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Abraxane, for the treatment of patients with TNBC.Importantly, apart from Korlym, Corcept is also evaluating CORT125134 for Cushing’s syndrome and a range of solid tumors. Early data on the candidate for Cushing’s syndrome has been quite promising. The company has begun dosing patients in a phase I/II study on CORT125134, in combination with Abraxane, for the treatment of a range of solid-tumor cancers. The possible target indications include triple-negative breast cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer and sarcoma.The company also has selective cortisol modulator CORT118335 in phase I study and results are expected in the second quarter of 2018. This compound is very potent in animal models of fatty liver disease along with both the prevention and reversal of weight gain caused by antipsychotic medications such as Zyprexa (olanzapine). The company expects to begin phase II trials for both indications in the third quarter of 2018.Also, during the third quarter of 2017 earnings release, the company raised 2017 revenue guidance. The company now projects revenues to be in the range of $157-$162 million, higher than its prior expectation of $145-$155 million. Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated Price  Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated Price | Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated QuoteZacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderCorcept has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

(PFE  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved its investigational oral SGLT-2 inhibitor, Steglatro (ertugliflozin) tablets, and Steglujan (ertugliflozin + sitagliptin) as an adjunct to diet and exercise for improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.Steglujan is a fixed combination of Steglatro and Januvia (sitagliptin), which is approved in patients who are eligible for treatment with the combination.Apart from these two drugs, the FDA also approved Segluromet (ertugliflozin + metformin) for the same indication in patients already treated with Steglatro or Glucophage (metformin) with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and patients who are already treated with combination of ertugliflozin and metformin.So far this year, shares of Merck have lost 4.3% compared with the industry’s growth of 16%. The FDA approved the drugs based on data from seven phase III studies, which evaluated Steglatro as monotherapy or in combination with Januvia and/or Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Glucophage. The studies also evaluated Steglatro in combination with insulin and a sulfonylurea. Data from the studies showed that Steglatro as a single agent or in combination with Januvia significantly reduced A1C level, a measure of blood glucose, compared to placebo.Steglatro also significantly reduced body weight in patients who were already receiving a combination of Januvia and Glucophage versus placebo. The drug also achieved significant reductions in systolic blood pressure.The approval of the three new drugs will boost Merck’s diabetes portfolio, which comprises Januvia and Janumet. Both the marketed drugs have seen volume growth in the first nine months of 2017 and have generated sales of $4.4 billion.However, Merck received a complete response letter from the FDA for supplemental New Drug Applications (“CRL”), seeking label expansion of Januvia, Janumet and Janumet XR in April 2017. The company is in discussion with the FDA to resolve the issues in the CRL. Moreover, Merck also received a setback earlier this month when its key immune-oncology drug, Keytruda, failed in a phase III gastric cancer study.Merck & Company, Inc. Price  Merck & Company, Inc.

2108,PFE,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved Ixifi its second biosimilar version of Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ  -  Free Report) blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”) drug, Remicade (infliximab). Notably, Ixifi is a chimeric human-murine monoclonal antibody against tumor necrosis factor.Ixifi received the nod for all approved indications of Remicade including RA, ulcerative colitis, plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and Crohn’s disease.Shares of Pfizer have risen 12.8% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s rally of 17.7%.The approval was based on an encouraging data from phase III study, REFLECTIONS B537-02. A biologics license application was filed with the FDA in April.Notably, in February 2016, Pfizer had divested the rights to development, commercialization and manufacturing of Ixifi in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) to Novartis' generic arm, Sandoz. However, Pfizer retains the commercialization and manufacturing rights to Ixifi in all countries outside the EEA.We remind investors that Pfizer’s first biosimilar product to Remicade, Inflectra, was launched last November in the United States. The company has exclusive commercialization rights to Inflectra in the United States and on certain other territories.In September, Pfizer filed a lawsuit in a U.S. district court alleging that J&J is resorting to unfair practices to prevent the sale of Inflectra, available at a Wholesale Acquisition Cost, which is 19% lower than J&J’s referenced product.Pfizer alleged in a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania that J&J has entered into biosimilar-exclusion contracts with U.S. insurers. These contracts boost insurers not to cover Inflectra, thus making it difficult to access by patients and protecting its referenced product.Pfizer also claimed that anticompetitive contracts with discounts were offered to hospitals on purchase of Remicade on condition that they do not buy the biosimilar versions. Pfizer claims that these unfair practices benefit sales of J&J’s referenced product, a key revenue generator for the latter.Pfizer is evaluating 13 biosimilar molecules in various stages of development. Biosimilar products in late-stage development include biosimilar versions of Roche's (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan and Avastin and AbbVie's (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira. A biosimilar version of Herceptin is under review in the United States and the EU. In Europe, Pfizer markets Nivestim, biosimilar versions of Amgen’s Neupogen and Retacrit as well as biosimilar versions of Amgen’s Epogen.Pfizer, Inc. Price Pfizer, Inc. Price | Pfizer, Inc.

2109,PFE,"Spark Therapeutics’ (ONCE  -  Free Report) shares plunged 35% on Dec 11 as investors were disappointed with the data from a phase I/II study evaluating its gene therapy candidate, SPK-8011, for treating hemophilia A.Data on SPK-8011 looked less competitive than BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.’s (BMRN  -  Free Report) hemophilia A candidate, valoctocogene roxaparvovec (formerly BMN 270), which achieved better factor VIII levels. BioMarin had announced data on its candidate last week.Shares of Spark Therapeutics have lost 4.4% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s rise of 2.6% in that period.The dose ranging phase I/II study evaluated doses of 5e11 vector genomes per kg (vg/kg) of body weight, 1e12 vg/kg and 2e12 vg/kg of SPK-8011The data announced form the phase I/II study showed impressive reduction in overall annualized bleeding rate (“ABR”) and overall annualized infusion rate (“AIR”). The ABR was reduced by 100% at week four to 0 from 5.5 annualized bleeds before initiating administration of SPK-8011. Similarly, AIR was reduced to 1.2 annualized infusions from 57.8 before SPK-8011 administration, a reduction of 96%.However, factor VIII levels achieved were not impressive and also not consistent. Two patients infused with 5e11 vg/kg achieved mean factor VIII activity levels of 10% and 16% after 12 weeks. Moreover, two patients infused with a dose of 1e12 vg/kg of SPK-8011. One of them achieved mean factor VIII activity level of 13% after 14 weeks and another patient achieved 9% after 19 weeks.BioMarin’s valoctocogene roxaparvovec achieved mean factor VIII activity levels of 49% and 89% for two tested doses of the candidate. However, BioMarin tested higher doses of its candidate – 4e13 vg/kg and 6e13 vg/kg.In a separate press release, Spark Therapeutics along with Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced data from another phase I/II study evaluating SPK-9001 for the treatment of patients with hemophilia B. Data from this study showed impressive reduction in ABR and AIR. Moreover, patients who were administered SPK-9001 had discontinued their regular factor IX concentrates infusions. They also showed sustained steady-state factor IX activity levels.Hemophilia A is rare genetic disorder characterized by mutation in factor VIII gene, which is responsible for clotting of blood in the human body. The deficiency of factor VIII increases the risk of bleeding that can become potentially life threatening even in case of modest injuries.Spark Therapeutics, Inc. Price  Spark Therapeutics, Inc.

2110,PFE,"The Dow experienced a holiday-shortened but eventful week, notching up gains on two successive days. Markets were closed on Monday for the Christmas Day holiday. A decline in the shares of a key tech component pushed the Dow downward on Tuesday. Tech stocks snapped a five-day losing streak on Wednesday to boost the index upward. These gains continued into Thursday with the index closing at yet another record high.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow declined by 0.1% last Friday as investors were reluctant to participate in intraday trading ahead of the Christmas holidays. This led to unusually low volumes for the day as a whole. Meanwhile, Trump signed the Tax Bill as well as the legislation passed by Senate to keep the government funded through Jan 19.Coming to economic data, new home sales for November came in at 733,000 units, more than the consensus estimate of 655,000 units. Orders for durable goods for November came in at 1.3%, below the consensus estimate of an increase of 2.3%. Meanwhile, personal savings rate for November declined to a decade low of 2.9%.The index gained 0.4% last week, posting its fifth straight week of gains. Senate Republicans finally passed the tax overhaul Bill. This development permanently slashes the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%.Following tax cuts, major banks and telecom companies pledged to provide better pay to their employees, which in turn boosted investor sentiment. Moreover, U.S. GDP increased in the third quarter, posting its best growth pace in more than two years.The Dow This WeekMarkets were closed for the Christmas Day holiday on Monday. The index decreased by 0.03% or 7.9 points following a decline in shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report). Shares of the iPhone-maker plummeted 2.5% — its worst decline since August, after Taiwan’s Economic Daily reported that the tech-giant is planning to cut its current quarter sales forecast for the new iPhone X by 40% to 30 million units, down from the initial 50 million units. Meanwhile, retail holiday sales in the United States surged to a six-year high, pushing the sector’s stocks higher. Further, energy shares rallied after U.S. crude futures surged on Tuesday. However, benchmarks ended in negative territory as losses incurred due to Apple could not be offset by these encouraging developments.The index increased by 0.1% as advances in major tech players offset declines in energy stocks. The technology sector snapped a five straight session losing streak to end in the green, buoyed by gains in Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report). But, the broader market largely continued its winning run after the Republicans passed the first U.S. tax reforms in 30 years.Overall, investors found few catalysts in one of the lowest-volume weeks of the year. Trading volumes in the U.S., in fact, remained at its lowest level in three years in 2017. Only on an average 6.43 billion shares were traded each day this year. Last year, about 7.22 billion shares were traded each day.The index gained 0.3% on Thursday, registering its 71st record close for the year. The Dow failed to register an intraday high, failing to achieve this milestone by only 0.2%. The index advanced by around 63 points with the largest contributions coming from UnitedHealth Group Incorporated UNH and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM  -  Free Report).Financials emerged as the strongest gainers for the day with the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) adding 0.2% on its second successive day of gains. Shares of Apple gained 0.3%. Meanwhile, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB) gained 0.5% following a 0.6% increase in prices of copper. Components Moving the IndexThe Boeing Company’s (BA  -  Free Report) business division, Defense, Space & Security, recently secured a foreign military sales (FMS) contract worth $6.2 billion.

Over the last five trading days, the Dow has gained 0.3%.Next Week’s OutlookThis has been a year to remember for the bourses, with the S&P 500 and the Dow up nearly 20% and 25%, respectively, year to date. Even at the close on Thursday, the Dow was on course for weekly gains. If this does indeed occur, the index will have posted weekly gains for the last six weeks of a year for the first time since 1954.There is little to suggest that these gains will not continue to occur going forward. Projections for fourth quarter earnings remain strong, fueled mainly by recently concluded tax reforms. Further, the economy continues to remain robust and international pressures are mostly absent. Given this backdrop, the Dow is likely to go from strength to strength even as we herald in 2018.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                   It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2111,PFE,"Wall Street is already off to a hot start in the New Year, with the Dow surging to new heights and tech giants like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) picking up right where they left off. But as tempting as it might be to try to find the next hot tech stock, one of the best places to start searching for 2018’s top picks might be where the massive institutional investors put their money.The term “institutional investor” covers a large spectrum of companies and firms, including mutual and pension funds, endowments, private foundations, insurance companies, large investment firms, and more. These institutional investors, in many cases, have the power to move markets.Investment institutions, which pour hundreds of millions of dollars into different stocks, often employ teams of analysts that perform expensive and highly detailed research before making large stock purchases. Once a position is taken, these institutions have the ability and resources to pump up the stock through favorable media coverage and investor conferences.And using Nasdaq’s Detailed Institutional Holdings page, which is based on 13F filings with the SEC as of September 2017, we can actually find out exactly what percentage of a company’s outstanding shares are held by institutions.With that said, let’s take a look at three stocks with high institutional ownershipthat investors might want to consider in 2018.1.      Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report)Institutional owners hold 70.55% of this pharmaceutical powerhouse’s shares. There are 2,105 institutional level holders that own a total of 4.20 billion shares. BlackRock (BLK) is the largest single holder with 440 million shares, while Vanguard and State Street Corp own 425 million and 309 million, respectively.Pfizer is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Growth and  a “B” for Value in our Style Scores system, helping it earn an overall “A” VGM score. The biopharmaceutical company is currently trading at 13.36x earnings, which comes in below the “Large Cap Pharmaceuticals” industry average.On top of that, Pfizer presents solid value to investors with P/B and P/S ratios that mark discounts compared to its industry’s average. Looking ahead to Pfizer’s fourth quarter, the company’s earnings are expected to surge 19.15% year-over-year, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Pfizer is set to report its Q4 results on Jan. 30.2.       Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report)Shares of Bank of America experienced a marginal dip on Wednesday after the company reported Q4 results that were subdued by a one-time, $2.9 billion charge related to the new GOP tax law. The company reported quarterly revenues that rose 2% year-over-year.In terms of large backers, the banking giant boasts a substantial 68.86% institutional ownership rate, with a total of 1,856 institutional holders claiming 7.18 billion shares. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) is the biggest of Bank of America’s institutional holders, claiming 679 million shares. Blackrock comes in second, owning 667 million BAC shares, while Vanguard claims 663 million shares.Bank of America is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and rocks a “B” grade for Momentum. What’s more, the bank is currently trading at 13.60x earnings, presenting a discount to its industry and the S&P 500. Also, looking ahead to 2018, Bank of America has experienced seven upward earnings estimate revisions for its upcoming full year within the last 60 days.3.       Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report)Microsoft is also currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Institutional investors own 74.10% the technology powerhouse’s current shares, with a total of 2,534 firms holding on to 5.72 billion MSFT shares. Vanguard, Blackrock, and Capital World Investors are currently the largest three institutional holders.Over the last 12 weeks, shares of Microsoft have popped 12.2% and currently rest just below their 52-week high. Microsoft also boats a current cash flow growth rate of 17.17%, which crushes its industry’s average and should help the company invest in new technologies like AI.Based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates, Microsoft is projected to see its current quarter earnings gain 3.61% year-over-year. The company’s quarterly revenues are projected to reach $28.35 billion, which would mark a nearly 9% surge from the year-ago period. Microsoft is set to report its fiscal year 2018 second-quarter results on Jan. 31.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

Glaxo’s vaccine business was strengthened by the acquisition of Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) non-influenza Vaccines business in 2015 for $7.1 billion. The meningitis vaccines, Menveo and Bexsero, have been performing well and are a key contributor to sales. Glaxo’s latest vaccine product in the pipeline is shingles vaccine, Shingrix.

2114,PFE,"2017 has been a banner year for the U.S. stock market and the trend is likely to continue next year. The tax reform will act as a major driving factor for stocks coupled with strong corporate earnings and accelerating economic growth in many parts of the world.As Christmas tree symbolizes good tidings, let’s build a similar tree for stock-loving investors that could rake in big gains in 2018.Starting with the base – the most valuable portion of the tree – the technology sector seems  to be a perfect fit here as it is placed in the top 6% among the 16 broad Zacks sectors. Within the Industry classification, Semiconductor – General is expected to outperform. Being a cyclical sector, it tends to move higher with market rallies. New areas such as autonomous cars, cloud computing, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence continued to fuel exceptional growth.Intel INTC having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) seems an excellent pick. The stock saw solid earnings estimate revision of 19 cents for the next year over the past 90 days and falls in the Industry having a Zacks Rank in the top 1%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The stocks that can form the leaves of the tree are Westlake Chemical Corporation (WLK  -  Free Report) from the basic materials sector and Acco Brand Corporation ACCO from industrial products sector. Both the sectors are expected to benefit from Trump’s pro-growth policies, especially big spending in infrastructure and thus carry a sector Rank in the top 13%.Westlake Chemical has a Zacks Rank #1 and is part of an industry with a Rank in the top 10%. It has seen solid earnings estimate revision of $1.32 for the next year over the past 90 days with an expected growth rate of 21.67%. On the other hand, Acco Brand saw positive earnings estimate of 4 cents for the next year over the past 90 days, with an expected earnings estimate of 6.98%. It has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and Industry Rank in the top 1%.(Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018? Be among the first to see our Top Ten Stocks for 2018 portfolio here.)For the top layer, we have selected the energy sector, which is expected to be the largest contributor to 2018 S&P 500 earnings with 33.3% growth. HollyFrontier Corporation HFC seems an intriguing pick in this sector having a Rank in the top 25%. The stock saw solid earnings estimate revision of 79 cents for the next year over the past 90 days with an expected earnings growth rate of 20.87%. It has a Zacks Rank #1 with an Industry Rank in the top 20%.At the very top is the star stock of 2017 with a Zacks Rank #1. XOMA Corporation XOMA has soared nearly 692% this year so far with room for more upside next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has moved up from a loss of $1.31 to a loss of 42 cents. Rising earnings estimates indicate analysts’ optimistic view on earnings, indicating higher chances of outperformance. Additionally, the stock boasts a solid Industry Rank in the top 45%.Now that we are done with the tree’s structure, it’s time to decorate it with bells, candies, lights and chocolates. For these, we can concentrate on areas expected to benefit most from the tax reform.Bells and candies could be the companies that are poised to benefit from tax policies to bring offshore cash home at reduced tax. The top five U.S. hoarders are from the tech sector - Apple AAPL, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) - that hold 88% of their money overseas, according to Moody’s. Drug makers like Amgen Inc. AMGN, Gilead Sciences GILD, Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and Merck & Co. (MRK  -  Free Report) also stash huge cash offshore and are likely to gain from tax repatriation policy. All these stocks have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Banking stocks could be the fairy lights on the tree that will light up on the dual tailwinds of rising rates and tax cuts. According to Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, tax cuts will add 16% to median bank earnings in 2018 and 18% in 2019 while AB Bernstein sees earnings per share jumping 12-20% at large banks and 15-25% at mid-caps banks in 2018. While there are several choices, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) currently has a Zacks Rank #2 and Industry Rank in the top 34%. The company is expected to generate double-digit earnings growth next year.Small cap stocks that pay the highest effective tax rate could be the sweet treats, as these will be the biggest beneficiaries of the corporate tax cut. According to Thompson Reuters data, companies in the Russell 2000 pay a median effective tax rate of 31.9%, while larger multinationals in the S&P 500 pay 28% and 30 mega-cap stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average pay 23.8%. Additionally, these tend to outperform in a rising rate environment. Given this, a spread of top-ranked stocks with 2018 double-digit earnings growth potential include Upland Software, Inc. (UPLD  -  Free Report), Farmers & Merchants Bancorp Inc. (FMAO  -  Free Report), Geopark Ltd GPRK and PetMed Express Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report). All these stocks doubled this year.And voila, the tree is up! May it bring in bountiful returns for investors with the jingle of Santa’s bells.  Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana. Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2116,PFE,"The Dow traversed a choppy week, marked by both gains and losses even as the much vaunted tax legislation finally gained legislative approval. The index increased on Monday on tax cuts hopes, but dipped on Tuesday following concerns that these changes may adversely impact future monetary stimulus. Another decline came on Wednesday following a pullback which occurred since investors had already priced in the impact of tax cuts. Ultimately, the index notched up gains on Thursday after banks and telecom companies pledged to provide better pay to their employees.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow increased by 0.6% last Friday, hitting a new all-time high following optimism that the much awaited Republican tax Bill had garnered sufficient support from policymakers to enable it to be passed the following week. Support from Senators Bob Corker and Marco Rubio raised expectations that the tax related legislation would not face any further obstacles to its passage.The index gained 1.3% last week following optimism over passage of the tax cut Bill and a higher rate environment. The Federal Reserve finally increased its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point. The new rate of interest will hover between 1.25% and 1.5%. Further, central bank officials reiterated their earlier projection of three possible rate hikes in 2018.The Dow This WeekThe index gained 0.6% on Monday following rising optimism that the much awaited Republican tax Bill was likely to be passed this week.

Additionally, a number of corporate deals also helped boost investor sentiment.The index lost 0.2% on Tuesday after optimism over the passage of the Republican tax Bill was outweighed by its likely impact on future monetary stimulus. Further, investors widely expected that the much-awaited tax cuts legislation would be passed this week, which in turn resulted in a stock sell-off.However, the House failed to comply with Senate rules on Tuesday, following which the House will re-vote for the tax Bill again on Wednesday. Housing starts rose to 1.297 million in November from the upwardly revised 1.256 million in October, well above analysts’ estimate of 1,251 million. Moreover, building permits increased by 3.4% year over year to settle at 1.298 million.The index declined by 0.1% on Wednesday as investors remained indifferent even as Congress passed the much-awaited Republican tax Bill.

Markets had already traded higher over previous sessions on optimism over the passage of the tax cut Bill and witnessed a sell-off after both the Houses actually passed the Bill.The index gained 0.2% on Thursday following gains in bank and energy stocks. Following the passage of the legislation related to tax cuts, major banks and telecom companies pledged to provide better pay to their employees, which in turn boosted investor sentiment.Additionally, energy sector rallied upward after WTI oil prices hit their second highest level so far in 2017.

The joint venture is the biggest producer in the Gippsland Basin. It was rumored that Zacks Rank #3 ExxonMobil and BHP Billiton will be compelled to end the joint venture and sell gas separately.The companies argued that the joint venture bolstered the economy and the termination will make new investment and supplies in Gippsland Basin more complex.The primary concern was that big gas buyers were receiving not more than two offers for multi-year deals. This will be possible only when ExxonMobil and BHP Billiton start marketing gas separately Consequently, ACCC announced that the companies will sell their gas separately from the Gippsland Basin from 2019.Legal actions can be taken if the partners fail to comply with the decision.

This brings to an end a long running political struggle and is likely to boost markets in the days ahead. Evidence of such a trend was visible on Thursday when the promise of higher pay from major companies boosted stocks.Moreover, GDP data has exceeded expectations by a wide margin.

2117,PFE,"Shares of Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) declined by almost 3.3% after the company’s Alzheimer's candidate, BAN2401, failed to meet the criteria for success based on a 12-months interim analysis as the primary endpoint in a mid-stage trial. The company is developing the candidate in collaboration with Eisai Co., Ltd.So far this year, shares of Biogen have gained 13.7% compared with the industry’s growth of 3%.The phase II study (Study 201) involves 856 patients with prodromal or mild Alzheimer's disease and positive biomarkers for brain amyloid pathology. The study uses Bayesian Adaptive Randomization Design which allows automatic changes to the design during the study. For early success, Study 201 will explore efficacy and the dose response of BAN2401 with 16 interim analyses, a 12-month evaluation based on Eisai's in-house developed Alzheimer’s disease Composite Score (ADCOMS) and an 18-month comprehensive assessment of treatment with placebo or 5 active arms. The Bayesian analysis at 12 months indicated that ""success was judged as an 80% or higher probability of achieving"" at least a 25% reduction in the rate of decline of ADCOMS versus placebo.The 16 interim analyses assessed potential for futility or stopping for safety. Neither of these conditions was met and the study continues to a full analysis at 18 months.Biogen stated that the 18-month blinded study will continue further analysis, following the predefined study protocol.  A comprehensive final analysis will be conducted at 18 months looking to demonstrate clinically significant results.  Data from the study are expected in the second half of 2018.Biogen is looking to strengthen its AD and other neurodegenerative disorders pipeline. Notably, the company’s Alzheimer's disease (AD) pipeline comprises candidates with different mechanisms of action including anti-tau candidate (BIIB092/BMS-986168-with potential in AD as well as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)), anti-amyloid (aducanumab) candidates as well as a BACE inhibitor (elenbecestat) program.However, the successful development of therapies for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease is challenging and we note that several companies have failed in developing treatments for the same. In November 2016, Eli Lilly & Company's (LLY  -  Free Report) anti-amyloid candidate — solanezumab failed to meet the primary endpoint in a late-stage AD study. Consequently, Lilly decided to drop the development of the candidate.Meanwhile, Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) shelved its late-stage Alzheimer’s candidate, bapineuzumab IV, after it failed two phase III studies. Pfizer was developing the candidate in collaboration with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Elan Corporation.The Alzheimer’s disease market represents a huge commercial potential and a successfully developed product could generate billions of dollars in sales once launched.Biogen Inc.

Given that there are no FDA-approved treatments currently available for this patient population, timely approval would be a boost for the company’s cancer portfolio.J&J has gained 22.4% year to date, compared to the 16.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.Allergan Provides Updates on Vraylar & Seysara: Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) provided a couple of updates on the pipeline front. The company and its partner Gedeon Richter said that Vraylar (cariprazine) met the primary endpoint in a late-stage in adults with major depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (bipolar I depression).

According to the American Cancer Society, about 9,000 new CML cases were diagnosed in the United States in 2017.Pfizer also announced that the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (“BTD”) for Bavencio (avelumab) for use in combination with Inlyta in treatment-naïve patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”). Avelumab is partnered with Merck KGaA. Breakthrough Therapy Designation helps fasten the development and review of drugs which are being evaluated for the treatment of serious conditions and where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may be substantially better than existing treatments on clinically significant endpoint(s).This is the second time that Bavencio has received BTD for a hard-to-treat cancer, the first time being for the treatment of patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) whose disease has progressed after at least one previous chemotherapy regimen.Label Expansion and Clinical Trial Collaboration for BMY’s Opdivo: Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY  -  Free Report) PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, Opdivo, gained FDA approval for yet another indication. The regulatory agency granted approval to Opdivo for intravenous use for the adjuvant treatment of patients with completely resected melanoma with lymph node involvement or metastatic disease.

Per statistics, approximately 30,000 patients in the United States and 68,000 around the world need a first-line treatment for advanced kidney cancer. As many as 14,000 patients need the same annually in the United States.The approval comes two months ahead of schedule. We note that Cabometyx (cabozantinib), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or TKI, was already approved for the treatment of RCC in patients who have already received anti-angiogenic therapy. Cabozantinib inhibits the activity of tyrosine kinases, including MET, AXL, VEGF receptors, and RET.  The approval came on the back of results from the randomized phase II, trial CABOSUN. The results demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) versus the current standard of care, Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Sutent. Importantly, Cabometyx demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant 52% reduction in the rate of disease progression or death. Median PFS for Cabometyx was 8.6 months versus 5.3 months for Sutent corresponding to a 3.3 month (62%) improvement.Sutent is widely used as a first-line treatment for RCC along with Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) Votrient. However, the FDA approval of Cabometyx on excellent rates of PFS might weigh on Sutent going forward though Pfizer too is striving hard to retain the drug’s leadership. In November 2017, the FDA approved a label expansion for Sutent. The drug was approved for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients at high risk of recurrent RCC following nephrectomy (surgical removal of the cancerous kidney). The approval was based on results from the S-TRAC trial that demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of a disease-free survival event (defined as the interval between randomization and tumor recurrence, or secondary primary cancer or death from any cause) for patients at high risk of RCC recurrence who received Sutent compared to placebo in the adjuvant setting.Meanwhile, Pfizer’s another drug, Inlyta, a TKI, is also approved for RCC. Bavencio (avelumab), a monoclonal antibody that inhibits PD-L1, in combination with Inlyta is being developed for the first-line treatment of advanced RCC, in collaboration with Merck KGaA .Sector Total Return %   Sector Total Return % |  QuoteOn the other hand, immunotherapies are gearing up too for place in this space. In September 2017, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) announced that a phase III study is evaluating Opdivo plus Yervoy combination in patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic RCC met its co-primary endpoint. The combination demonstrated superior overall survival (OS) compared to Sutent in intermediate- and poor-risk patients. The combination also met a secondary endpoint of improved OS versus Sutent in randomized patients.  Consequently, an independent Data Monitoring Committee has recommended that the trial be stopped early based on a planned interim analysis.  Last week, the FDA accepted Bristol-Myers’ supplemental Biologics License Application for priority review of Opdivo plus Yervoy (ipilimumab) to treat intermediate- and poor-risk patients with advanced RCC with an action date of April 16, 2018. The FDA had previously granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for this application which should expedite the review.Additionally, a variety of combination therapies being developed for RCC, including Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Avastin and Tecentriq. Earlier in the month, Roche announced that the phase III IMmotion151 study met its co-primary endpoint of investigator-assessed PFS and demonstrated that the combination of Tecentriq and Avastin provided a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of disease worsening or death in patients whose disease expressed the PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1: Expression ≥1%) protein compared with Sutent for the first-line treatment of people who have advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Top-line results from the co-primary endpoint of OS are not mature.Eisai Inc. and Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) are also evaluating the combination of the former’s Lenvima a multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (including fibroblast growth factor receptors [FGFR] 1 – 4), in combination with the latter’s anti-PD-1 therapy Keytruda for treatment-naïve and previously treated patients with metastatic clear cell RCC. The combination is being evaluated for first-line use of the combination in the ongoing phase III study, CLEAR. The combination reported encouraging interim results in September 2017.Hence, we expect investors to keep their focus in this space in 2018 given the stiff competition brewing up.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

2120,PFE,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced superiority of its breast cancer candidate – talazoparib – over chemotherapy in improving progression free survival (“PFS”) in a phase III study, EMBRACA.Talazoparib is an investigation dual-mechanism poly ADP ribose polymerase (“PARP”) inhibitor. The company will present the data from the study at the 2017 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium.Shares of Pfizer have gained 9.3% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s rise of 4.4% in that period.The EMBRACA study evaluated talazoparib as a single agent in patients with germline BRCA-positive breast cancer who have received prior chemotherapy treatment. The candidate achieved a significant reduction of 46% in the risk of disease progression as the median PFS was 8.6 months in the talazoparib arm versus 5.6 month in the chemotherapy arm.Moreover, 62.6% of patients in talazoparib arm achieved complete or partial response against 27.2% of patients receiving chemotherapy.PARP inhibition is a new targeted therapy, which inhibits repair of the DNA of the cell, thus destroying the cell. The label expansion application of AstraZeneca’s (AZN  -  Free Report) PARP inhibitor, Lynparza, is under review in the United States. Meanwhile, Clovis Oncology, Inc. (CLVS  -  Free Report) has collaborated with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) to develop its PARP inhibitor in combination with the latter’s PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, Opdivo, in breast cancer.Apart from talazoparib, Pfizer is also developing its key drug, Ibrance for treating advanced or high-risk early breast cancer. Ibrance is currently approved for HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer.Pfizer, Inc. Price  Pfizer, Inc. Price | Pfizer, Inc. QuotePfizer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2121,PFE,"Last week, we issued an article where we mentioned that mergers and acquisitions, which were quite lean in 2017, may pick up significantly in 2018 if the proposed tax reforms are finally approved.The reforms aim to cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, which can boost profits of large drug/biotech companies. The change in tax code will also allow companies to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one-time tax rate of 10%.These changes will definitely leave more cash in the hands of drug/biotech companies. Also, with focus on drug pricing taking a backseat and large drug/biotech companies struggling with organic growth, there is a lot of chatter about a possible increase in large M&As in 2018.Given that it takes several years and millions of dollars to develop new therapeutics from scratch, large pharmaceutical companies sitting on huge piles of cash may prefer to buy innovative small/mid cap biotech companies to build out their pipelines.In this article, we discuss some mid- and large-cap names that may be logical acquisition targets next year for companies like Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and others. What matters for buying a drug/biotech stock is the current sales performance of its drugs/products, prospects of future sales growth, and the quality of the pipeline.The four companies we discuss have most of these factors going in their favor. Acquisitions of small-cap drug/biotech companies are very difficult to predict and quite frequent. Hence, these have been excluded from the discussion.BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BMRN  -  Free Report)Companies whose product/pipeline portfolio includes rare disease drugs are in great demand as it is a less competitive space and the expensive treatments can bring in huge profits. BioMarin is one such drug developer. Its market cap is around $14 billion.BioMarin’s key orphan disease drugs – Vimizim and Kuvan – continue to do well, backed by strong underlying patient demand trends. BioMarin expects sustained growth in both the drugs. Brineura’s earlier-than-expected approval this year for the treatment of children with CLN2 disease, a form of Batten disease, was also a huge boost for BioMarin.Its impressive rare disease pipeline is also progressing well with approval for pegvaliase for the treatment of phenylketonuria expected in 2018. On the pipeline, we believe both late-stage candidates – vosoritide - for achondroplasia, the most common form of dwarfism, and BMN27 – for hemophilia A -  have blockbuster potential.BioMarin has already been the target of takeover speculation. Companies like Gilead (GILD), Amgen (AMGN) and Roche may be interested in buying BioMarin.Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (VRTX  -  Free Report)For Vertex, 2017 so far has been a tremendous year with positive data read-outs and regulatory approvals leading to an increase in eligible patient population for its two approved cystic fibrosis (CF) - Kalydeco & Orkambi. CF is Vertex’s main area of focus. With a consistent expansion in patient population, Vertex’s CF product revenues have increased quarter to quarter throughout 2017.The company is optimistic that the positive trend of CF sales will continue in 2018 as it gains additional reimbursement approvals for Orkambi in ex-U.S. markets and gets approval to launch tezacaftor(VX-661)/ivacaftor combination medicine.Meanwhile, the company has also made decent clinical progress across multiple CF studies this year and has meaningful pipeline catalysts. The market cap of Vertex is around $36 billion.Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) Incyte’s strong oncology portfolio makes it a lucrative target for companies like Gilead, Amgen and Bristol Myers. The market cap of Incyte is more than $20 billion.The primary reason why Incyte is ripe for buyout is its two products on the market, Jakafi and Iclusig.Jakafi, a JAK inhibitor, is the first and the only product to be approved by the polycythemia vera (PV) and myelofibrosis (“MF”) – two rare blood cancers. Jakafi is seeing strong sales performance driven by strong patient demand for both indications.  In order to expand the patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug, the company is working on expanding its label further. Iclusig is approved for chronic myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Meanwhile, Incyte’s pipeline boasts candidates like immune therapy epacadostat — being studied in combination with anti-PD-L1 agents of Merck, Bristol Myers and others — and Olumiant for rheumatoid arthritis – approved in Europe and regulatory application to be filed in the United States in January 2018.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report)Like BioMarin, Alexion is also focused on the development and commercialization of life-transforming drugs for the treatment of patients with ultra-rare disorders. Its key drug is Soliris, approved for two severe and ultra-rare disorders — paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) — have been consistently doing well. Meanwhile, Alexion is working on expanding the drug’s label to include additional indications, which if approved, can boost further sales growth. It has two other drugs for rare diseases called Strensiq and Kanuma, which are emerging as growth drivers. Alexion also has a robust pipeline of several candidates under development including Soliris follow-up candidate, ALXN1210.Roche, Pfizer, or Novartis may be interested in buying Alexion. The market cap of Alexion is more than $25 billion.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2122,PFE,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced encouraging new data of a post-hoc analysis from a phase III study, evaluating the combination of its breast cancer drug, Ibrance (palbociclib), with Novartis' (NVS  -  Free Report) Femara (letrozole) for the first-line treatment of ER+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer.Notably, data from the study will be presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) on Dec 8.Ibrance is approved in the United States for treating HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with an aromatase inhibitor as an initial endocrine-based therapy in postmenopausal women. It is also approved to be used with AstraZeneca's (AZN  -  Free Report) Faslodex in women with disease progression following the endocrine therapy. Presently, Ibrance is approved in more than 75 countries.Pfizer’s shares are up 9.9% so far this year, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s return of 16.5%. In the PALOMA-2 study, it was seen that a combination of Ibrance and Femara led to an improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) or the time before recurrence of tumor growth by more than a year compared with Femara plus placebo. In other words, the study showed that the median PFS for women treated with Ibrance plus Femara was 27.6 months compared with 14.5 months for the Femara-placebo combination arm, thereby indicating a 44% reduction in the risk of disease progression.PALOMA-2 had enrolled 666 women in all from 186 global sites across 17 countries. The updated results and the safety profile from the post-hoc analysis are consistent with the primary data from the PALOMA-2 study, reported last November.We remind investors that Ibrance in combination with Femara was cleared in the United States under an accelerated approval in February 2015 for treatment of HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer. In April, Pfizer received a regular approval for the drug based on data from the PALOMA-2 trial. Also, around the same time, Ibrance’s label was expanded covering a few more indications to be used in combination with any aromatase inhibitor and not just Femara.Pfizer is exploring the possibility of expanding Ibrance into recurrent and subsequent early breast cancer as well as several non-breast cancer indications like pancreatic and head and neck cancers.Ibrance has been generating strong sales as a key driver of the company’s top line. The drug logged sales of $2.41 billion in the first nine months of 2017, up 61% year over year. On successful label expansion, the drug should reap in more revenues.However, in the breast cancer market, competition for Ibrance has increased with recent launches for Eli Lilly's (LLY  -  Free Report) Verzenio and Novartis’ Kisqali.Pfizer, Inc.

2123,PFE,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved its leukemia drug, Bosulif in first-line setting.We remind investors that Bosulif is currently approved for the treatment of chronic, accelerated or blast phase Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in adults who are resistant or intolerant to prior therapy.The drug is now approved for the first-line treatment of patients suffering from chronic phase Ph+ CML. Please note that Pfizer has a partnership with Avillion for BosulifShares of Pfizer have risen 13.8% this year so far, comparing unfavorably with a 17.3% increase for the industry. The supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) filed by Pfizer for the label expansion was granted priority review by the FDA in August. The sNDA filing was based on data from a phase III study (BFORE). In December last year, Pfizer and Avillion announced that the study had met the primary endpoint, demonstrating superiority of Bosulif (bosutinib) over Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Gleevec.Additionally, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepted a similar regulatory application for review.Bosulif recorded revenues of $163 million, up 35% year over year. With the approval to treat newly diagnosed patients, which will expand the eligible patient population, the drug’s sales should improve further.Bosulif’s label expansion makes it the third approval for a hematology indication in five months. Two leukemia treatments — Besponsa for relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Mylotarg for newly diagnosed CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) — were approved in third quarter of 2017.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderPfizer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the pharma/biotech sector include H.

2124,PFE,"Quite a few pharmaceutical industry mergers may be in the cards in 2018 if the proposed tax reforms are finally approved. The U.S. Senate passed an amended tax reform bill last week, thereby successfully passing the second stage. The bill will now be presented to a conference committee where representatives from the House and Senate will come together to draft the final bill.The tax reforms propose to cut the tax rate for corporates from 35% to 20%, which can boost profits of large drug/biotech companies. Meanwhile, the change in tax code will also allow companies to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one-time tax rate of 10%.These changes should definitely leave more cash in the hands of drug/biotech companies. The cash can be invested for mergers/acquisitions, which have been few in 2017 compared to 2016. Contrary to expectations of increased pharma and biotech mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in 2017, the focus was mostly on small bolt-on acquisitions and licensing deals and agreements.Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) nearly $12 billion acquisition of Kite Pharma and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) $30 billion acquisition of Swiss biotech Actelion were the only two noteworthy deals of this year.With rising investor expectation that Trump's action on drug prices may not be as onerous as previously feared, there is a lot of chatter about a possible increase in M&As.Meanwhile, the major drug/biotech players struggling with organic growth need an infusion of new growth drivers in their pipeline/product portfolios — either from internal development or from buying assets. Strategic M&A and licensing deals are therefore inevitable for innovation starved drug/biotech companies looking for growth in a highly competitive and global marketplace.Drug/biotech companies have regularly tried to merge or acquire competitors in mega-merger deals to achieve critical mass both in R&D and sales and marketing. Meanwhile, smaller biotech research firms investigating new therapies or interesting pipeline candidates have also attracted the attention of larger counterparts in the last few years.With focus on drug pricing taking a backseat and possibility of repatriation of funds, hopes are high that M&A activity will pick up. Companies like Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), and J&J are expected to take the lead supported by their robust cash flow and balance sheet.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2125,PFE,"The pharma and biotech sectors have made a nice comeback this year with the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index gaining 11.7%, while the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index is up 17.7% year to date. This is in sharp contrast to 2016, which saw pharma and biotech stocks under a lot of pressure with the sector facing intense criticism for rising drug prices.Drug pricing was not the only reason for the sector’s underperformance last year. A fewer number of drug approvals, high-profile pipeline failures, slower-than-expected new product launches and increasing competition were some of the other factors that weighed on the sector.However, factors like ramp up in new product sales, R&D success and innovation, strong results, a higher number of FDA approvals and continued strong performance from key products have contributed to a sustained recovery in the sector in 2017.Importantly, investors now seem more comfortable with the drug pricing scenario and are focusing more on the fundamentals of the sector. So what are the factors that could drive the sector’s performance? First and foremost, this is an industry that will continue to witness demand for its products given an aging population and the increasing prevalence of a wide variety of diseases. Strong pipelines, innovative treatments, impressive results, and increased health care spending should support growth. A faster drug approval process and the proposed removal of outdated regulations that drive up costs and slow down innovation should also provide benefits. The sector will receive an additional boost if more mergers & acquisitions (M&As) are announced in the coming quarters.But drug pricing will remain a headline risk until there is more clarity on the situation. Other challenges for the sector include the growing presence of biosimilars, generic competition, a slowdown in the growth of legacy products and major pipeline setbacks.How to Pick WinnersAnyone interested in biotech and pharma stocks will know that it could be challenging to pick winners in this “high risk - high returns” industry which is constantly growing and changing. Companies which hit the bull’s eye become overnight success stories with shares doubling or even tripling on positive news. However, negative outcomes have an equally strong effect on the shares and failure may very well spell doom for these companies.In such a scenario, let’s take a look at stocks preferred by analysts who have a deep knowledge and understanding of the industry and its companies. We have zeroed in on five stocks with the help of our Zacks Stock Screener - these stocks have been given a Strong Buy or Buy rating by 80% or more brokers and sport a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy).Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc.

2126,PFE,"Merck KGaA  is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 earnings results on Nov 9.Merck KGaA’s share price has increased 1.2% year to date, while the industry gained 2.4%.The company reports results under three business sectors – Healthcare, Life Science and Performance Materials.Merck’s revenues were driven by sales growth in its Healthcare and Life Science segment in the first half of the year. We expect the positive trend to continue this quarter. Meanwhile, the company is streamlining its Healthcare business to focus on its pipeline of innovative medicines.During the first half of 2017, the company received approval for Bavencio in metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) and advanced bladder cancer in the United States. Moreover, the drug was approved in the EU and Japan for treating mMCC in late September. However, Bavencio hasn’t generated any meaningful sales as reported by Merck’s partner, Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report). Merck’s multiple sclerosis drug, Mavenclad, was also approved in Europe this quarter.The company continues to develop Bavencio in partnership with Pfizer for several cancer indications.However, we expect sales of three key drugs, Rebif, Erbitux and Gonal-f to be lower this quarter due to continued competitive pressure and price reduction. However, favorable currency movement is expected to positively impact the top line in the third quarter.Moreover, operating expenses increased during the first half due to new launches and higher pipeline development cost. With the company focusing on the development of an innovative pipeline and launch of Bavencio in new indications and geographies, costs are expected to be higher in the third quarter.In September, Merck completed the divestment of its Biosimilars business to Fresenius as part of its strategy to become a leading science and technology company. The company is planning to focus on developing its pipeline in oncology, immuno-oncology and immunology. Meanwhile, Merck announced that it is also planning a partial or full sale of its consumer health business, which includes a number of leading products in over-the-counter (OTC) categories.We expect management to shed light on progress and commercialization plans for Bavencio on the earnings call. It may also provide updates on its strategic plans.Merck KGaA Price and Consensus  Merck KGaA Price and Consensus | Merck KGaA QuoteStocks that Warrant a LookHere are a couple of health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – to post an earnings beat this quarter.

(EXEL  -  Free Report) recently announced FDA approval for label expansion of its lead drug Cabometyx for the treatment of previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).The approval came on the back of positive results from the randomized phase II, trial CABOSUN on first line kidney cancer. The results demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) versus Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Sutent.We remind investors that the company received a significant boost in April 2016 when the FDA approved the tablet formulation of cabozantinib (distinct from the capsule form) under the brand name Cabometyx for the treatment of RCC in patients who have already received anti-angiogenic therapy. Cabometyx was also approved in the EU in September 2016 for the treatment of advanced RCC in adults who had earlier received vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy.Cabometyx raked in strong sales in the first nine months of 2017, reflecting the rising demand for the drug. New patient market share in the second-line plus setting rose to 38%.Hence, a label expansion of the drug for first-line treatment of kidney cancer will increase the target market and boost sales.  Exelixis’ share price has increased 78.9% year to date compared with the industry’s gain of 4.2%.Meanwhile, the CELESTIAL study for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is in progress and the top-line results are expected shortly. The company obtained orphan drug designation for the same in the United States. HCC is the most common form of primary liver cancer, accounting for more than 90% of cases in the United States. In October, Exelixis announced that the CELESTIAL trial met its primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) with cabozantinib providing statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS compared to placebo in patients with advanced HCC. The independent data monitoring committee for the study recommended that the trial to be stopped for efficacy following review of the second planned interim analysis. Exelixis plans to submit an sNDA to the FDA in the first quarter of 2018.Exelixis has also inked agreements with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) and Roche Holding AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) to develop cabozantinib in combination with immunotherapy agents.Zacks RankExelixis carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2129,PFE,"AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has accepted and granted priority review to its supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for the label expansion of Tagrisso (osimertinib). AstraZeneca’s sNDA seeks to expand Tagrisso’s label to include first-line treatment of adult patients with locally-advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) whose tumors have EGFR mutations.With the FDA granting priority review, a decision is expected within six months. The drug also enjoys Breakthrough Therapy Designation for this indication, which was granted in October 2017.A similar application for Tagrisso’s label expansion is under review in the EU and Japan.Tagrisso is already marketed as second-line treatment for patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC in the United States, European Union, Japan and China.AstraZeneca’s shares have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has rallied 22% compared with the industry’s gain of 17.3% during the period.The sNDA was based on data from the phase III FLAURA study, which compared Tagrisso with the standard-of-care EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (“TKI”) therapy in the first-line lung cancer setting.Data from the study showed that the risk of progression or death was reduced by more than half in the Tagrisso arm compared to the commonly-used EGFR inhibitors. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 18.9 months for patients on Tagrisso compared with 10.2 months in the comparator arm. Tagrisso was well-tolerated in the trial with a safety profile, consistent with the previous experience.Tagrisso registered sales of $651 million in the first nine months of 2017, reflecting growth of 136% from the year-ago period and accounting for 4% of total sales. A potential approval in the first-line setting will further boost the prospects of the drug.The lung cancer market is crowded with several companies developing or marketing treatments. Roche Holding AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report)/Astellas’ Tarceva is approved for treating NSCLC while Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) is developing its drug Xalkori in a phase III study as a first-line treatment for NSCLC. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) is also developing Opdivo as a treatment for NSCLC. AstraZeneca also has Iressa approved for treating NSCLC and is developing Imfinzi for the same indication.Meanwhile, lung cancer is the most common cause of death among all cancer indications, and its variation in mutations in different genes gives opportunities to different therapies to gain market share.Astrazeneca PLC Price  Astrazeneca PLC Price | Astrazeneca PLC QuoteAstraZeneca carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2130,PFE,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that it has bought exclusive rights to develop and commercialize Swiss company Basilea Pharmaceutica’s anti-fungal treatment, Cresemba (isavuconazole), in China and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region.Notably, Cresemba is an intravenous (IV) and oral azole antifungal therapy, presently marketed in the United States as well as the EU for treating two serious infections, invasive aspergillosis and invasive mucormycosis.Per the deal, Pfizer will be exclusively entitled to distribute and commercialize Cresemba across 16 Asia-Pacific countries and China including Hong Kong and Macao. Significantly, the financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed by the company. However, Pfizer does not own any marketing rights in Japan, which too lies in the Asia-pacific belt.  Shares of the company have risen 11.9% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s rally of 16.5%. We remind investors that in July, Pfizer bought exclusive commercialization rights to Cresemba in Europe, including Austria, France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom where the treatment was already available. Last month, the company launched the drug in Spain and has plans to introduce the medicine to additional European countries in 2018.However, Pfizer has no marketing rights in the Nordic countries namely, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Iceland or across the United States. Cresemba is marketed by Basilea Pharmaceutica's license partner, Astellas Pharma, in the United States.It is important to note that the company already enjoys a strong position in the anti-infective space and markets many antifungals like Vfend, Zithromax and Zavicefta, the last one being added to Pfizer’s portfolio with the December 2016 acquisition of AstraZeneca plc's (AZN  -  Free Report) anti-infectives business.The latest collaboration with Basilea Pharmaceutica strengthens Pfizer’s position in the therapeutic market.Pfizer, Inc.

2131,PFE,"With a busy earnings season almost coming to an end after an impressive run, we are again focused on latest cancer updates happening every week. The week gone by saw three cancer drugs receiving FDA approval for new indications – Roche Holding AG’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Gazyva, Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Sutent and AstraZeneca PLC’s (AZN  -  Free Report) Faslodex. However, an interesting product in development is a cancer vaccine that Moderna Therapeutics and Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) are working on. Merck has provided a fund of $200 million to develop the vaccine in combination with its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, in return for a right to half of the potential sales. The vaccine will be personalized and Moderna has just developed one for its first enrolled patient. Top-line data is expected in September 2019. AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (AVEO  -  Free Report) also announced the launch of its first drug, Fotivda, which was approved in Europe for treating kidney cancer in August 2017.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesAstraZeneca's Faslodex Approved for Combination Use: The FDA approved a new indication for breast cancer drug, Faslodex, on Nov 15. The label of Faslodex will now be expanded to include combination use with Eli Lilly’s (LLY) new CDK4/6 inhibitor Verzenio to treat women with HR+, HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose disease has progressed after endocrine therapy. (Read more: AstraZeneca's Faslodex Gets FDA Nod for Use With Verzenio)Astrazeneca PLC Price and Consensus  Astrazeneca PLC Price and Consensus | Astrazeneca PLC QuotePfizer’s Sutent Approved as Adjuvant Treatment for Kidney Cancer: The FDA approved label expansion of cancer drug Sutent (sunitinib malate). With the latest FDA approval, Sutent’s label has been expanded to include the adjuvant treatment of adult patients at high risk of recurrent renal cell carcinoma (""RCC""). This approval marks the first and only adjuvant treatment for recurrent RCC. Sutent is presently marketed for the first-line treatment of advanced RCC and has been the standard-of-care for this indication since its approval a decade ago.An application for use in the same patient population is also under review in the EU.Pfizer, Inc. Price and Consensus  Pfizer, Inc. Price and Consensus | Pfizer, Inc. QuoteRoche’s Gazyva Approved in First-line Setting for Blood Cancer: Roche obtained FDA approval for Gazyva in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated advanced follicular lymphoma (stage II bulky, III or IV). The patients who respond to the combination therapy will continue to be treated with Gazyva alone. The approval was based on superior progression-free survival achieved by the drug compared to Rituxan in phase III GALLIUM study.The drug is already approved for use in combination with chlorambucil to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia (""CLL"") in adults who have not had previous CLL treatment.Roche Holding AG Price and Consensus  Roche Holding AG Price and Consensus | Roche Holding AG QuoteAVEO Adds First Drug to its Commercial Portfolio: AVEO and its partner EUSA Pharma announced the launch of its kidney cancer drug, Fotivda in the European Union. The company expects to initiate selling in Europe starting with Germany. The drug received approval in August as first-line treatment of advanced RCC in adult patients. The drug is also approved in patients who are not treated with VEGFR and mTOR pathway inhibitor therapy, following disease progression after a cytokine-based therapy. The approval and launch was a major milestone for AVEO as Fotivda is the first and only marketed drug in the company’s portfolio. While the acceptance of the drug is yet to be seen, it cuts AVEO’s dependence on funds from collaboration to some extent.AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and Consensus  AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and Consensus | AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. QuoteApart from these label expansions and drug launches, the buzzword of the immuno-oncology segment, CAR-T therapy, grabbed the headlines. In a major boost to Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) and Bluebird Bio, Inc. (BLUE  -  Free Report), the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to their CAR-T therapy candidate, bb2121. The candidate also received access to PRIority Medicines in Europe. bb2121 is being developed for previously treated patients with multiple myeloma. With these regulatory designations, the development is expected to expedite.Meanwhile, Bayer signed a collaboration agreement with a small U.S. based company, Loxo Oncology, which gives it access to the latter’s pipeline candidate, LOXO-195. With this, Bayer gets an entry into the field of cancer treatment where the drug attacks cancer based on genetics rather than attacking the organ of origin. Moreover, Celsion submitted its phase I/II clinical study protocol to the FDA, which will evaluate its DNA-based immunotherapy, GEN-1, as localized treatment of ovarian cancer.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2132,PFE,"AstraZeneca, plc (AZN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted approval to a new indication for its breast cancer drug, Faslodex.The label of Faslodex will now be expanded to include combination use with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) new CDK4/6 inhibitor Verzenio/abemaciclib to treat women with HR+, HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose disease has progressed after endocrine therapy.The FDA approval was based on the MONARCH 2 study data, which showed that Faslodex+Verzeniosignificantly improved progression-free survival (16.4 months) compared to Faslodex+ placebo.Shares of this London, United Kingdom based pharma giant have gained 22.2% so far this year, comparing favorably with the industry’s growth of 14%.In August, Faslodex had received FDA approval for a label extension in the first-line monotherapy setting for the treatment of postmenopausal women with HR+ advanced breast cancer. Until this approval, Faslodex was only approved for advanced breast cancer in later lines of treatment.We believe that the FDA approval for two new indications for Faslodex in three months can improve sales of the drug in the future quarters. The drug has generated sales of $703 million in 2017 so far, up 16% year over year.Also, please note that this is the second time that Faslodex has been approved for use in combination with a CDK4/6 inhibitor.

2133,PFE,"World Diabetes Day is celebrated every year on November 14. The theme this year is ‘Women and diabetes - our right to a healthy future’. The focus is on emphasizing the importance of providing women (diabetics as well as those at risk of being diagnosed with diabetes) with affordable and equitable access to essential diabetes drugs and technologies, self-management education and information needed to achieve optimal diabetes outcomes and strengthen their capacity to prevent type II diabetes. The ninth leading cause of death in women across the world, diabetes accounts for 2.1 million deaths every year.According to information provided by the International Diabetes Foundation (""IDF""), more than 199 million women have diabetes with this figure expected to rise to 313 million by 2040. Among these, more than 60 million women are of reproductive age with one in seven births being affected by gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes is associated with a higher risk of type II diabetes in the mother as well as the child.Moreover, many people with type II diabetes remain unaware of their condition for a long period of time and this may lead to diabetes-related complications by the time the disease is diagnosed. Women with type II diabetes are considered to be 10 times more likely to suffer from heart disease compared to women without the condition.Other diabetes-related complications include blindness, lower-limb amputation and kidney failure.Given these statistics and complications, it is not surprising that several healthcare companies devote a significant amount of R&D dollars on developing treatments and devices for diabetes and diabetes management. The diabetes market is highly crowded with companies coming out with innovative treatments promising higher efficacy with lower side effects. Currently available diabetes drugs include different classes of treatments like DPP-4 inhibitors (Januvia, Onglyza, Trajenta), GLP-1 receptor agonists (Victoza) and SGLT-2 (Invokana, Farxiga) apart from metformin and insulin.In addition to drugs, the diabetes care market includes glucose monitoring systems, insulin delivery systems as well as insulin pumps.Stocks to Watch on World Diabetes DayThis World Diabetes Day, here is a look at some of the key pharma companies in the diabetes market.Denmark-based Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO  -  Free Report) is among the key players in the global diabetes market. The company’s diabetes portfolio comprises products like Tresiba (a once-daily new-generation insulin), Xultophy (a once-daily single-injection combination of Tresiba and Victoza), Ryzodeg (a soluble formulation of Tresiba and NovoLog), Fiasp (fast-acting mealtime insulin - a new formulation of NovoLog) and Victoza (GLP-1).Recent developments include Victoza and Tresiba’s label updates (Victoza’s U.S. label now reflects prevention of cardiovascular events while Tresiba’s EU label reflects significant reduction in the risk of severe hypoglycemia) as well as a positive FDA advisory panel vote for semaglutide. Approval could come later this quarter.However, pricing pressure in the United States remains a major challenge for the diabetes care market while intense competition across the globe also remains a headwind.Shares of Novo Nordisk have gained 38.8% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 14.5% rally. Novo Nordisk is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.French drugmaker Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) is another key player in the diabetes market. However, the company’s Diabetes franchise is under pressure with key product, Lantus, facing increasing competitive pressure at the payor level and biosimilar competition in several European markets. Toujeo, Apidra, Amaryl, Lyxumia and Soliqua are some of the other diabetes products in the company’s portfolio. Sanofi expects its global Diabetes sales to decline 6–8% annually (at constant exchange rates) over the 2015–2018 timeframe. Pricing pressure, increasing competition and formulary exclusions will continue impacting the segment.Despite the challenges in the diabetes market, Sanofi continues to work on expanding and strengthening its diabetes portfolio and currently has five diabetes candidates in its pipeline including SAR438335 (GLP-1R/GIPR dual agonist; phase I for type II diabetes), SAR425899 (GLP-1R/GCGR dual agonist; phase II for type II diabetes), sotagliflozin (oral SGLT-1&2 inhibitor; phase III for type I and type II diabetes), SAR341402 (rapid acting insulin; phase III for type I and II diabetes) and efpeglenatide (long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist; phase III for type II diabetes scheduled to commence this quarter). Late-stage combination studies for sotagliflozin in type II diabetes are scheduled to commence this quarter.Shares of Sanofi are up 10.4% year to date, compared to the industry’s 14.5% rally.Diabetes (New Cardiovascular & Metabolic Diseases) is one of the growth platforms at AstraZeneca plc (AZN  -  Free Report). Key products in AstraZeneca’s diabetes portfolio include Farxiga, Onglyza, and Bydureon among others. Recent approvals include an improved device for Bydureon, Bydureon BCise, and a combination of Farxiga and Bydureon for type II diabetes.AstraZeneca’s Diabetes franchise sales in the United States are also feeling the impact of intense pricing pressure and competition.Shares of AstraZeneca, a Zacks Rank #3 stock, are up 20.5% year to date, compared to the industry’s 14.5% rally.Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) is another well-known player in the diabetes market. Lilly has a strong portfolio of diabetes treatments including Trulicity (GLP-1), Jardiance (SGLT-2), Trajenta, Humulin, Basaglar, Humalog, and Glyxambi. The company has a diabetes alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim for several of these products. Lilly also has a strong diabetes pipeline. While the company expects pricing pressure to continue in the diabetes market in 2018, the exclusion of Jardiance from the CVS health formulary could also impact the company’s diabetes franchise sales.Shares of Lilly are up 12.7% year to date, compared to the industry’s 14.5% rally. Lilly is also a Zacks Rank #3 stock.Merck & Co., Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) diabetes franchise, which accounted for 16.7% of third quarter 2017 pharma segment sales, consists of products like Januvia and Janumet. However, like its peers, Merck’s diabetes segment sales continue to be affected by pricing pressure.Merck, along with partner Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), is currently seeking FDA approval for ertugliflozin and two fixed-dose combination products (ertugliflozin and Januvia, ertugliflozin and metformin) with a response from the FDA expected in December 2017.Merck is also a Zacks Rank #3 stock. The company’s shares have declined 6.4% year to date, compared to the industry’s 14.5% rally.Although the diabetes market is currently facing intense pricing pressure and competition, the market remains lucrative considering the growing prevalence of the disease and the demand for new and better treatments.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2134,PFE,"Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) announced disappointing results from a pivotal phase III KEYNOTE-061 study, evaluating its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda (pembrolizumab), as a second-line treatment for patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (“GEJ”) adenocarcinoma.Notably, Keytruda is already approved in the United States as a monotherapy for third-line treatment of advanced gastric or GEJ. Additionally, it is approved for many types of cancers and treatment settings including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical hodgkin lymphoma and bladder cancer.Shares of Merck has lost 4.9% this year so far compared unfavorably with the industry’s 16.5% increase.The phase III study failed to meet its primary endpoint of overall survival (OS). Notably, the progression free survival (PFS) showed no statistical significance in the PD-L1 positive patient population.However, the company said that it will continue to evaluate Keytruda in two other phase III studies, both as a monotherapy as well as in combination with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for patients with GEJ.We remind investors that Keytruda is a key top-line driver for Merck and it brought in $1.5 billion sales in third-quarter 2017, up 18.8% sequentially and 194% year over year. Sales continue to be driven by a launch of new indications globally.Significantly, Keytruda sales in the United States have gained particularly from a strong momentum in the new indication of first-line lung cancer. The drug’s sales were primarily driven by melanoma outside the United States.Meanwhile, the Keytruda development program also significantly advanced this year with regulatory approvals for four new indications in the United States and two additional diseases in Europe.Important approvals include nods for advanced bladder cancer in both the United States and the EU, advanced microsatellite instability-high cancers and the first sanction for a combination therapy with Eli Lilly & Company’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drug Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo), a commonly used chemo regimen in lung cancer.Keytruda is continuously growing and expanding into new indications and markets globally. It is under trial for more than 30 types of cancer in above 650 studies including excess of 300 combination studies.Merck is collaborating separately with several companies namely Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report), Incyte, Glaxo and Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens.Merck & Company, Inc. Price Merck & Company, Inc.

2135,PFE,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved a label expansion for its janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, Xeljanz (tofacitinib), for two doses — 5 mg twice daily and 11 mg once-daily extended-release (XR) formulation.With this latest approval, Xeljanz can now be administered for treating adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA), who had an inadequate response to conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, respectively.Notably, Xeljanz (5 mg twice daily) is approved in the United States as a second-line treatment option for patients with moderate-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”), who have had an inadequate response to or cannot tolerate methotrexate (MTX). The drug was approved in Europe and China in March for RA. Significantly, this is the first and only JAK inhibitor approved in the United States for both moderate to severe RA and an active PsA.Shares of Pfizer have gained 12.3% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s rally of 16.5%.A supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for Xeljanz was filed with the FDA in May this year for the aforementioned indication. The approval was based on encouraging data from two phase III OPAL (Oral Psoriatic Arthritis TriaL) studies — Broaden and Beyond — on Xeljanz.Both OPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of Xeljanz on adult patients with PsA. The programs achieved the primary efficacy endpoint of a statistically significant improvement with twice-daily Xeljanz 5 mg compared with placebo at three months as per measurement by American College of Rheumatology 20 response and the change from baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index score.Overall safety results from these studies were found to be consistent with those observed in the broader rheumatology development program for Xeljanz.We remind investors that the company is also looking to get the drug’s label expanded to include treatment of adult patients suffering from moderate-to-severe active ulcerative colitis. A response from the FDA is expected in March next year.Additionally, Pfizer is conducting a phase IIIb/IV head-to-head study comparing Xeljanz with AbbVie's (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira. In February, the company announced top-line results from the assessment. Outcomes from the trial demonstrated non-inferiority of combo therapy comprising Xeljanz plus MTX compared with the other combo agents Humira plus MTX, thus meeting the primary endpoint.We are encouraged by Pfizer’s label expansion efforts.

2136,PFE,"Major pharma companies like Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report), Sanofi (Read more: Sanofi Q3 Earnings In Line, Sales Lag, Diabetes Weak), Allergan (Read more: Allergan Tops Q3 Earnings Estimates, Tweaks 2017 View) and Novo Nordisk (Read more: Novo Nordisk Tops Q3 Earnings Estimates, Lags Sales) reported third quarter results last week.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesWhy Did Teva’s Shares Plunge after Q3 Earnings? Teva’s shares plunged 19.9% following the release of third quarter results. While the company missed on earnings, revenues were in-line with expectations. However, the key reason for the stock’s poor performance was the lowered outlook with the company facing huge revenue erosion with its key branded drug, Copaxone, facing generic competition for the 40 mg formulation as well. This development alone is expected to hit 2017 earnings by 30 cents per share. Meanwhile, the Generics business continues to face headwinds with price erosion remaining a major challenge (Read more: Teva Stock Plunges 20% on Q3 Earnings Miss & View Cut).     Key Takeaways from Pfizer’s Q3 Conference Call: Pfizer’s third quarter earnings surpassed expectations and resulted in the company raising its earnings outlook for the year (Read more: Pfizer Beats on Q3 Earnings, Raises 2017 EPS View). The company said that key brands including Ibrance and Eliquis globally and Xtandi, Lyrica, Xeljanz and Chantix in the United States continue to perform well.However, the company is facing supply shortages for products from the legacy Hospira portfolio mainly due to capacity constraints and technical issues. At the time of acquiring Hospira (completed in September 2015), Pfizer had expected that it would take up to a couple of years to integrate the manufacturing plants and resolve the majority of the supply chain issues. On the third quarter call, the company said that it expects to make substantial progress in 2018 toward cutting down the sterile injectable shortages.Regarding Inflectra, Pfizer’s biosimilar version of J&J’s Remicade, the company said that penetration in the United States continues to be slower than expected due to the exclusionary contracting of Remicade by J&J. We remind investors that Pfizer has filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court against J&J related to providing patient and physician access to lower cost biosimilars (Read more: Pfizer Sues J&J, Accuses it of Preventing Inflectra Uptake).Pfizer also provided an insight on the expected impact of loss of exclusivities (LOEs) in the next few years. While LOEs are expected to affect revenues by about $2 billion in each of the next three years, this will go down to approximately $1 billion in 2021 and will not be more than $500 million from 2022 through 2025.As far as near term pipeline and regulatory updates are concerned, Pfizer expects a decision from the FDA for its type II diabetes drug, ertugliflozin, in December. Meanwhile, top-line results on PARP inhibitor, talazoparib, from the phase III EMBRACA study will read out by year end. The study is evaluating talazoparib versus standard-of-care chemotherapy in patients with germline BRCA-positive metastatic breast cancer.Data on PD-L1 inhibitor Bavencio plus Pfizer’s 4-1BB agent in patients who have not been previously treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor is also due later this year. Pfizer is also looking to submit an application with the FDA for lorlatinib, its next-generation ALK inhibitor for the treatment of ALK-positive metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, by year end.Pfizer has gained 9.4% year to date, compared to the 15.4% rally of the industry it belongs to.Novartis Seeks Label Expansion for Kymriah: Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) is looking to expand the label of Kymriah, the first CAR-T therapy to gain FDA approval. The company is seeking FDA approval for the use of Kymriah for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant (“ASCT”). Novartis has Breakthrough Therapy designation for r/r DLBCL. DLBCL is the most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (“NHL”). r/r DLBCL is a highly aggressive and difficult-to-treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is fatal in almost 40% of patients due to relapsed or refractory disease. Kymriah is currently approved for patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (“ALL”) that is refractory or has relapsed at least twice. Approval for the r/r DLBCL indication would expand the patient population for Kymriah though Gilead already has a presence in this area with its CAR-T therapy Yescarta being approved for the treatment of adult patients with certain types of large B-cell lymphoma who have not responded to or who have relapsed after at least two other kinds of treatment.Novartis also announced its intention to acquire Advanced Accelerator Applications to strengthen its presence in oncology (Read more: Novartis Buys French Radiopharmaceutical Company).FDA Approves AstraZeneca’s Blood Cancer Drug: AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) gained accelerated FDA approval for its BTK inhibitor, Calquence (acalabrutinib), for adult patients with previously-treated mantle cell lymphoma, an aggressive type of blood cancer that is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage and associated with a high relapse rate. We note that AbbVie’s Imbruvica is also approved for this patient population.AstraZeneca also expanded its clinical trial collaboration with Incyte – the companies will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Incyte’s investigational selective IDO1 enzyme inhibitor, epacadostat, in combination with AstraZeneca’s PD-L1 inhibitor, Imfinzi, compared to Imfinzi alone in early lung cancer.Meanwhile, AstraZeneca said that its IL-13 human monoclonal antibody, tralokinumab, failed to achieve the primary endpoint in a late-stage study for severe, uncontrolled asthma. Top-line results from another late-stage study showed that tralokinumab failed to achieve a statistically-significant reduction in oral corticosteroid (“OCS”) use, the primary endpoint, when added to the standard of care, in patients dependent on OCS.FDA Nod for J&J Drug Label Expansion: The FDA also granted approval to a new dosage (10 mg once-daily) of Johnson & Johnson’s Xarelto. The 10 mg formulation is approved for use in reducing the continued risk for recurrent venous thromboembolism (“VTE”) after completion of at least six months of initial anticoagulation therapy. Johnson & Johnson is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Valeant Gets FDA Nod for Vyzulta and PDUFA Date for IDP-118: Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.'s (VRX  -  Free Report) Vyzulta (latanoprostene bunod ophthalmic solution, 0.024%) also gained FDA approval for the reduction of intraocular pressure (“IOP”) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The company also announced that the FDA has accepted its regulatory application for IDP-118 (halobetasol propionate and tazarotene) lotion, an investigational topical treatment for plaque psoriasis. A response from the FDA regarding the approval status of the treatment is expected by Jun 18, 2018.PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index declined marginally this week.

2142,PFE,"Every year, World Aids Day is celebrated on Dec 1 to raise public awareness about Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome, popularly known as AIDS. The day is observed to make people aware about proper cure and prevention of the disease. In this regard, this year, the theme for the day this year is ""Right to Health."" This day also commemorates those who have died from an AIDS-related illness.World AIDS Day is one of the eight official global public health campaigns marked by the World Health Organization (WHO). According to WHO, globally, about 36.7 million people were suffering from HIV/AIDS at the end of 2016. Of the total, 2.1 million were children less than 15 years old.AIDS is a pandemic disease caused due to the infection of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). The virus weakens the immune system by destroying cells that fight diseases and infections, eventually leading to AIDS. Medicines for the treatment of HIV are called antiretroviral therapy (ART) that slow or put a check on the progression of the virus.Currently, companies are investigating new medicines to treat, prevent and ultimately cure HIV. Scientists also are exploring new treatment paradigms like two drug regimens, making therapies/drugs drugs with improved long-term safety profiles and new mechanisms of actions.Despite improved medical understanding of HIV and significant efforts made by leading government and medical bodies to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS, this disease still has limited treatment options. In 2016, 1 million people died of AIDS-related illnesses, totaling to 35.0 million since the start of the epidemic.Based on these statistics, it is not surprising that several healthcare companies are investing a significant amount of their R&D expenditures on developing treatments and devices for HIV and AIDS.Stocks to Watch For On World AIDS Day, here are some of the key pharma companies in the HIV market that investors can rely on.GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) has a long-standing commitment to HIV and AIDS. The company had developed the widely used antibiotic amoxycillin around 40 years ago, which was the first medicine approved to treat HIV. The sales of older HIV products — Epzicom and Selzentry — have been declining. However, the newer HIV drugs —Triumeq and Tivicay — are witnessing a consistent increase in sales and gaining market share.Meanwhile, a significant portion of its R&D expenditures are being used toward developing HIV medicines to treat/prevent HIV.Last week, Glaxo and partner Johnson & Johnson announced the FDA approval for Juluca — a combination of Glaxo’s Edurant/dolutegravir and J&J’s Tivicay/rilpivirine into a single tablet — for the treatment of HIV. Most medicines for HIV treatment are made up of three or more antiretroviral drugs. Juluca is the first two-drug regimen to be approved that reduces the number of medicines HIV patients take without compromising on the efficacy of a conventional three-drug regimen.This week ViiV Healthcare, an HIV company majorly owned by Glaxo and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), announced the start of a large late-stage African study that will evaluate long-acting cabotegravirinjection for the prevention of HIV in sexually active women. If approved, cabotegravir injections will be administered every two months as opposed to presently available oral anti-retroviral medication, which needs to be taken every day.Already, ViiV Healthcare has started conducting a HPTN 083 study on cabotegravirin HIV-uninfected men and transgender women who have sex with men, under co-funding with National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Meanwhile, cabotegraviris also being evaluated in three late stage studies as atwo drug regimen withEdurant, with the third study initiation announced earlier this week.Furthermore, Glaxo is developing two drug regimen ofdolutegravir + lamivudine.Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) is a dominant player in the HIV market with an impressive portfolio. In fact, Gilead’s HIV franchise is a major contributor to sales with approved drugs like Genvoya, Truvada, Atripla, Stribild, Descovy, Odefsey and Complera.The company was the first to introduce a single-tablet regimen (STR) for the treatment of HIV — Atripla. Gilead’s other STRs for HIV include Complera/Eviplera and Stribild. Its TAF-based product, Genvoya, happens to be a bestseller surpassing both Truvada and Atripla since fourth-quarter 2016.Currently, Gilead’s bictegravir single table regimen (STR) for HIV treatment is under priority review in the United States. The FDA is expected to announce its decision in February 2018.The STR is a fixed-dose combination of bictegravir, an INSTI, and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF), a dual-NRTI backbone. This combination is also under review in the EU.Another company working towards developing HIV drugs is Johnson and Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report). The company along with partner Glaxo recently received FDA approval for first two-drug regimen- Juluca, as discussed above. Further, the company along with The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and National Institutes of Health is conducting an efficacy study for an investigational mosaic HIV-1 preventive vaccine.The study will evaluate whether the vaccine is safe and is able to reduce the incidence of HIV infection among women in sub-Saharan Africa.  HIV has a significant unmet need and women and girls account for about 60% of people living with HIV in eastern and southern Africa.OthersSome other popular marketed HIV drugs are AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report), Kaletra and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Isentress.Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) also recently received a tentative FDA approval for its combination tablet comprising efavirenz, lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.Meanwhile, Merck is developing an investigational non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, doravirine both as a single-entity tablet and in combination (fixed dose tablet) with other antiretroviral agents — lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). The company plans to file regulatory applications for the same before the end of 2017.ConclusionAIDS/HIV is a life threatening disease which has limited medical cure. However, there are numerous companies that are developing drugs for the treatment and care for people suffering from HIV and for them who are at risk of becoming infected with HIV, thereby making the space competitive.While Johnson & Johnson sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), both Glaxo and Gilead carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2143,PFE,"There was no major news in the cancer space this week, except the failure of Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Bavencio in a gastric cancer study. In a setback to Eisai Co., Ltd. (ESALY  -  Free Report), National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (“NICE”) did not recommend the approval of its breast cancer drug, Halaven, for use in second-line setting in UK.Meanwhile, AstraZeneca’s (AZN  -  Free Report) filing for label expansion of Tagrisso in first-line setting for treating lung cancer was accepted by the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”). Apart from this, Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug, Opdivo, again proved its worth by achieving superior overall survival (“OS”) in a phase III lung cancer study. Moreover, Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. (CLDX  -  Free Report) also announced initiation of a phase I study on its new oncology candidate, CDX-1140, in solid tumors.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesPfizer’s Bavencio Fails in Gastric Cancer Study: Pfizer along with its Germany-based partner Merck KGaA announced the failure of a phase III study evaluating their key pipeline candidate, Bavencio (avelumab), for the treatment of gastric cancer in third-line setting.The study – JAVELIN Gastric 300 – evaluated Bavencio as a monotherapy in patients with unresectable, recurrent or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma and whose disease has progressed following two prior therapeutic regimens. However, another study, JAVELIN Gastric 100, continues to evaluate the drug in first-line switch maintenance setting.

2144,PFE,"World AIDS Day takes place every year on December 1 with people across the world coming together to fight against HIV, to support those living with HIV and to commemorate those who have died from an AIDS-related disease.Everybody CountsThe slogan for this World AIDS Day is “Everybody Counts”. The goal is to ensure access to affordable and high quality care and services for people with HIV, a strong health care system, as well as the integration of HIV, tuberculosis and hepatitis services.According to information provided by the World Health Organization (“WHO”), more than 35 million people have lost their lives due to HIV so far while one million people died last year from HIV-related causes. At the end of 2016, approximately 36.7 million people were living with HIV. Number of newly-infected HIV patients was 1.8 million in 2016.Currently Available TreatmentsWhile there is no cure for HIV at present, the virus can be controlled through the use of effective antiretroviral (“ARV”) drugs. According to WHO, 54% of adults and 43% of children with HIV are currently on lifelong ARV - 19.5 million people living with HIV were receiving antiretroviral therapy (“ART”) in 2016. Combination ART (combining 3 or more ATV drugs) has been found to be effective in suppressing viral replication within a person's body thereby allowing the immune system to strengthen and regain the capacity to fight off infections.The HIV drug landscape has evolved over the years with drugs with varying mechanisms of action being approved over the years. These include multi-class combination products (Atripla, Complera, Stribild), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs – Combivir, Epivir, Truvada, Viread), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs – Edurant, Sustiva), protease inhibitors (PIs – Prezista, Reyataz, Norvir), HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTI - Isentress, Tivicay) as well as fusion inhibitors and entry inhibitors (CCR5 co-receptor antagonist).According to WHO, new HIV infections fell by 39% between 2000 and 2016 while HIV-related deaths declined by one-third with ART saving 13.1 million lives. However, with only 70% of HIV-infected people being aware of their status, there remains significant need to spread awareness about the disease and the availability of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), which detect the presence or absence of HIV antibodies.  According to GlobalData, the HIV market across the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK, Japan, Brazil, and China, is expected to grow from $16.3 billion in 2015 to $22.5 billion by 2025.There is significant need for new alternative ARV treatment options that come with better tolerability, higher efficacy, and lower rates of treatment discontinuation. Here is a look at a few key players in the HIV market.4 Drug Stocks in FocusJohnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report): J&J is a key player in the HIV market with the company introducing several transformational medicines in this therapeutic area over the last 25 years. The company and its partner GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) recently gained FDA approval for  Juluca, the first, complete, single-pill, two-drug regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in certain adults living with the disease who are virologically suppressed.The once-daily, antiretroviral is a combination of Tivicay (INSTI) and Edurant (NNRTI) which maintains the safety and efficacy of a traditional three-drug regimen without an NRTI. Simpler treatment regimens will make compliance easier for HIV patients who need to stay on a consistent treatment regimen in order to keep their viral counts low.The company is currently seeking FDA approval with partner Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) for a darunavir-based single tablet regimen (“STR”). The once-daily regimen comprises darunavir 800mg/cobicistat 150mg/emtricitabine 200mg/tenofovir alafenamide 10mg (D/C/F/TAF).J&J is also working on an HIV vaccine. The company along with The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and National Institutes of Health is conducting an efficacy study for an investigational mosaic HIV-1 preventive vaccine. There is significant unmet need for a vaccine for HIV – although a lot of progress has been made in treating and managing the disease, almost two million people become infected every year. Developing a vaccine for HIV has proved to be challenging due to the unique properties of the virus including its ability to mutate rapidly. Moreover, genetic diversity with multiple strains and subtypes prevalent in different parts of the world are additional hurdles.J&J is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. The stock has gained 20.9% year to date, compared to the 16.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.Gilead Sciences, Inc.: HIV is one of the primary areas of focus at Gilead. The company’s HIV portfolio includes drugs like Genvoya, Truvada, Atripla, Descovy, Odefsey, Complera and Stribild which contributed approximately $9.5 billion to total sales in the first nine months of 2017. Gilead’s TAF-based products like Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey remain key growth drivers. Gilead is currently seeking FDA approval for an investigational, fixed-dose combination of BIC/FTC/TAF with the FDA expected to respond on Feb 12, 2018. Meanwhile, the company expects to complete a 6mg cohort phase I study on GS-9620 (TLR-7 agonist, HIV cure) by year end. A late-stage study evaluating Descovy for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is scheduled to complete in the third quarter of 2018.With the company’s hepatitis C virus (“HCV”) franchise seeing declining sales, Gilead is focusing on its HIV franchise for growth. The company’s non-HCV products are expected to generate sales of $16 - $16.5 billion in 2017. However, competition in this market is intense. Moreover, the company is facing competition from generic products as well.Gilead is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. The stock has gained 4.4% year to date, compared to the 2.6% rally of the industry it belongs to.GlaxoSmithKline: Glaxo is a majority stakeholder in ViiV Healthcare, a global specialist HIV company, which was set up in partnership with Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) in 2009 and now has Shionogi as a shareholder as well. Key products in the HIV portfolio include Triumeq and Tivicay. Glaxo is working on bringing new growth drivers into the HIV business with Juluca being a recent addition. Glaxo is exploring new treatment paradigms (two drug regimens), new modalities (long-acting injectables) and new mechanisms of actions (including maturation inhibitors and broadly neutralising antibodies). The company is working on a dolutegravir – lamivudine combination which will also be for naive patients and a long-acting cabotegravir plus rilpivirine combination.ViiV has commenced a late-stage study on long-acting cabotegravir for the prevention of HIV infection in sexually active women. The study will compare cabotegravir injections given every two months to daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.Glaxo, a Zacks Rank #3 stock, has declined 8.9% year to date, compared to the 16.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.Merck (MRK  -  Free Report): Merck has a presence in the HIV market in the form of Isentress/Isentress HD, HIV integrase inhibitors for use in combination with other antiretroviral agents. The company’s HIV franchise brought in sales of $896 million in the first nine months of 2017, down 15% from the year-ago period mainly due to lower demand in the United States due to competitive pressures.Merck’s HIV pipeline has a couple of late-stage candidates - MK-1439 (doravirine, NNRTI) and MK-1439A (doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate – DOR/3TC/TDF). The company expects to file for regulatory approval of doravirine both as a single-entity tablet and as a fixed-dose combination tablet (DOR/3TC/TDF) by year end.Merck, a Zacks Rank #3 stock, has declined 6.1% year to date, compared to the 16.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

2145,PFE,"GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) has announced the start of a large late-stage African study on an experimental long-acting injection for the prevention of HIV. ViiV Healthcare, an HIV company majorly owned by Glaxo and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), said that the phase III study, HPTN 084, will evaluate long-acting cabotegravir monotherapy for the prevention of HIV infection in sexually active women.ViiV Healthcare is conducting the study under a public private funding collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. While NIAID, part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is sponsoring the study, ViiV Healthcare and Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) are providing the medicines. The study will enrol more than 3,000 women between the age of 18 and 45 from sub-Saharan African countries.In order to prevent HIV infection, uninfected people, at present, use oral anti-retroviral medication, which needs to be taken every day. Compared to these, cabotegravir injections will be administered every two months, if approvedGlaxo’s shares have declined 9% this year so far, underperforming the 16.2% increase witnessed by the industry.ViiV Healthcare is already conducting a HPTN 083 study on cabotegravir in HIV-uninfected men and transgender women who have sex with men, also under co-funding with NIAID. Meanwhile, cabotegravir is also being evaluated in three late stage studies as a two drug regimen with Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Edurant/rilpivirine, with the third study initiation announced earlier this week.Last week Glaxo and partner J&J announced FDA approval of the first dual treatment for HIV, Juluca (Tivicay/dolutegravir + Edurant/rilpivirine). Juluca has been developed under a partnership between ViiV Healthcare and Janssen.HIV has been a key therapeutic area for Glaxo. Its two new HIV drugs, Tivicay and Triumeq have been recording consistently strong sales while gaining market share. Glaxo’s HIV sales rose 16% at constant exchange rate in the first nine months of 2017. Meanwhile, a significant portion of its R&D expenditures goes toward developing HIV medicines to treat/prevent HIV.Glaxohas a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2146,PFE,"Shares of Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc. (MNTA  -  Free Report) were down 12.6% after the company reported disappointing results from a phase I study on M834, which it was conducting with partner Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) for the proposed biosimilar of Orencia.The company also reported a loss of 44 cents per share in the third quarter, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents. The reported loss was, however, wider than the year-ago loss of 26 cents.Mylan N.V. Price and EPS Surprise  Mylan N.V. Price and EPS Surprise | Mylan N.V. QuoteRevenues in the quarter came in at $24.1 million and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss of $23.2 million. However, revenues were down 17.3% from the year-ago quarter. Momenta’s stock has decreased 15.1% year to date compared with the industry’s rally of 4.1%. Quarter in DetailMomenta’s top line comprises product revenues of $10.9 million earned from Sandoz’s sales of Glatopa, a generic version of Copaxone (20 mg), compared with $23.4 million in the year-ago quarter. The 53% decrease was primarily due to higher sales deductions, inventory price adjustments owing to Mylan's entry into the Copaxone market along with a deduction of $0.2 million for reimbursing the company’s share of Glatopa-related legal expenses to Sandoz.Collaborative research and development revenues came in at $13.2 million, up from $5.8 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was due to a $10-million commercial milestone payment earned in connection with Glatopa 20mg/mL. However, the upside in sales was partially offset by less revenues due to the termination of the Baxalta Collaboration Agreement, effective Dec 31, 2016.While, research and development expenses were up to $37.9 million from $31.6 million, general and administrative expenses increased 31% to $20.7 million.Outlook UpdatedMomenta now expects operating expenses (excluding stock-based compensation and net of collaborative revenues) in the range of $200-$210 million, compared with the previous guidance of $210-$230 million in 2017. The guidance also includes approximately $50 million of capital expenditure on M923. Operating expenses in third-quarter 2017 are projected around $43-$53 million.Momenta expect to generate revenues of $45 million from Mylan as upfront payment on a quarterly basis.Pipeline UpdateSandoz’s abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) for the 40-mg thrice-weekly formulation of Copaxone (Glatopa 40mg) was under the FDA review. However, Momenta suffered a setback with the FDA issuing a warning letter to Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) in February 2017, which is Sandoz’s contracted fill/finish manufacturing partner for Glatopa.Pfizer has submitted a comprehensive response to the observations cited in the warning letter. The ANDA approval is now contingent on the satisfactory resolution of the compliance observations stated in the warning letter issued to Pfizer.Meanwhile, Momenta continues to progress with its other pipeline candidates. Currently, Momenta’s M923, a biosimilar version of AbbVie, Inc. ABBV Humira, is being evaluated in a phase III study in patients suffering from moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Moving ahead, the company plans to submit the candidate for approval to regulatory bodies.However, Momenta announced that M834 did not meet its primary pharmacokinetic end points in a phase I study to compare the pharmacokinetics, safety and immunogenicity of M834 to Orencia in normal healthy volunteers. Hence, Momenta and partner Mylan will evaluate the next course of action.Furthermore, Momenta’s novel autoimmune portfolio includes: M230, a Selective Immunomodulator of Fc receptors (SIF3) and M281, an anti-FcRn monoclonal antibody. Momenta successfully completed a phase I single ascending dose study in healthy volunteers for M281. The multiple ascending dose portion of the study was initiated in January 2017 and completed in August 2017. Top-line data is expected in fourth-quarter 2017.Our TakeMomenta’s third-quarter results were overshadowed by the disappointing results from a phase I study on the proposed biosimilar verison of Orencia. Momenta has already suffered a blow. We note that Mylan has already won FDA approval for a generic version of Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA  -  Free Report) Copaxone 40 mg. Notably, this is the first generic of Copaxone that has been approved.Since Mylan was one of the first applicants to submit a substantially complete ANDA for glatiramer acetate Injection, 40 mg/mL, containing a Paragraph IV certification, the company and other first filers may be eligible for 180 days of generic drug exclusivity. On the other hand, Momenta’s ANDA approval for Glatopa is contingent on the satisfactory resolution of the compliance observations stated in the warning letter issued by the FDA, resulting in a delay of approval.Zacks RankMomenta currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2147,PFE,"While reports about tech giant Amazon meeting generic drugmakers made the rounds, companies like Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.’s (TEVA  -  Free Report) were in the news with the former reporting late-stage data and the latter announcing leadership and organizational changes.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesIs Amazon in Talks with Generic Drugmakers? According to a CNBC report, tech giant Amazon is in preliminary discussions with generic drugmakers including Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) and Novartis’s generic arm, Sandoz, about entering the pharmacy market. With not much information being available, there is a lot of speculation and discussion among industry watchers about the way the tech giant is planning to enter the market – as a drug wholesaler or a retailer.Pfizer, Merck KGaA’s Bavencio Fails in Late-Stage Study: Pfizer and Merck KGaA suffered a setback in their efforts to expand the label of their checkpoint inhibitor, Bavencio (avelumab) with the therapy failing to meet the primary endpoint of superior overall survival (“OS”) compared with physician's choice of chemotherapy. The late-stage study was being conducted to evaluate Bavencio for the third-line treatment of unresectable, recurrent or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction (“GEJ”) adenocarcinoma patients whose disease progressed following two prior therapeutic regimens, regardless of PD-L1 expression.The companies continue to evaluate Bavencio in the first-line switch maintenance setting for gastric cancer. According to information provided by the companies, gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the world and the third most common cause of cancer death. With survival in advanced disease being poor and usually less than a year, the third-line setting is a difficult-to-treat population (Read more: Pfizer/Merck KGaA's Bavencio Fails in Gastric Cancer Study).Leadership & Organizational Changes at Teva: Teva’s new CEO has announced changes in the organization as well as leadership structure of the company. A key change is that the generics and specialty medicines segments will now operate as a single segment across three regions – North America, Europe and Growth Markets. The Generic R&D and Specialty R&D organizations will also be merged into one global group while a newly formed Marketing & Portfolio function will be set up. With these changes, Dr. Michael Hayden, Dr. Rob Koremans and Dipankar Bhattacharjee will be exiting Teva effective Dec 31, 2017. Several new appointments were also announced while a detailed restructuring plan will be unveiled in mid-December.Teva has many challenges ahead – paying down debt, divesting non-core businesses to increase focus on core areas and generate cash, delivering on the pipeline and getting the U.S. generics business back on track. Generic competition for Copaxone 40mg is another major setback for the stock.Teva has lost 59.1% of its value year to date versus the 29.2% decline recorded by its industry.Mylan’s Biosimilars under EU Review: Mylan and partner Biocon said that the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) has accepted their marketing applications for biosimilar versions of Roche’s Herceptin (trastuzumab) and Amgen’s Neulasta (pegfilgrastim). While Herceptin is used for the treatment of certain HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers, Neulasta is used for the reduction of the duration of neutropenia (low count of neutrophils, a type of white blood cells) and the incidence of fever associated with neutropenia in adult patients treated with chemotherapy in certain types of cancer.Both marketing applications had been withdrawn earlier following an audit that was conducted by the European inspecting authority of Biocon's drug product facility. Biocon said that it has completed the Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPAs) based on the audit – these will be verified during inspection as part of the regulatory review process.Meanwhile, the companies should get a response from the FDA for their regulatory application for their biosimilar version of Herceptin by December 3. Earlier this year in July, the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (“ODAC”) had voted in favor of approving the biosimilar. Although the FDA is not required to do so, it usually follows the recommendations of its advisory panels.J&J and Partners Commence HIV Vaccine Efficacy Study: With focus on World AIDS Day today, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) along with The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and National Institutes of Health has initiated the first efficacy study for an investigational mosaic HIV-1 preventive vaccine. The study will evaluate the vaccine’s efficacy and safety in reducing the incidence of HIV infection in 2,600 women in sub-Saharan Africa. There is significant unmet need for a vaccine for HIV – although a lot of progress has been made in treating and managing the disease, almost two million people become infected every year. Developing a vaccine for HIV has proved to be challenging due to the unique properties of the virus including its ability to mutate rapidly. Moreover, genetic diversity with multiple strains and subtypes prevalent in different parts of the world are additional hurdles.We note that another efficacy study evaluating a different vaccine candidate is being conducted in South Africa.J&J is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

2149,PFE,"Earnings and Revenue BeatShares of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) increased 3.5% at market close on Oct 17, 2017 after beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both earnings and revenues. The company’s revenues of $19.7 billion increased 10.3% in third-quarter 2017 on a year-over-year basis and 4.5% on a sequential basis. It came ahead of the consensus mark of $19.28 billion.Increase in sales was driven primarily by strong sales of cancer drugs and recent acquisition activity. Earlier this year in June, JNJ in its biggest ever acquisition  bought Swiss biopharmaceutical company Actelion for $30 billion.Johnson & Johnson reported non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $1.9 for third-quarter 2017, up 13.1% year over year and 3.8% on a sequential basis. It beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.8.Segment Sales and OutlookThe company reported increase in sales by geographical segments. U.S. sales increased 9.7% to $10.3 billion from $9.4 billion, while International sales increased 10.9% to $ 9.4 billion from $8.4 billion.Moreover, on a business-segment basis, the company reported improvements in all the three segments. Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical devices revenues increased 2.9%, 15.4% and 7.1% respectively.The company increased its revenue guidance for full-year 2017 to the range of $76.1-$76.5 billion and updated its adjusted EPS guidance to $7.25-$7.30.Industry FactorsIn a latest executive order, Trump aimed at scrapping a key component of Obamacare. The President said that he wanted to end subsidies to insurers that cost $7 billion this year and help millions of low-income Americans pay medical expenses. Moreover, Trump took a dig at drug pricing and accused companies of getting away with murder by charging sky high drug prices.The uncertainty was reduced to some extent as news of the two political parties coming to a bipartisan deal started doing the rounds. Senators of both parties said they reached a deal to stabilize Obamacare for the short term and allow insurer subsidies. However, changes in the deal might be in the cards as it has to be passed by the Congress and signed by Trump first.In the current scenario, we believe it is prudent to discuss the following ETFs that have a relatively high exposure to Johnson and Johnson (see all Health Care ETFs here).Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to healthcare stocks and tracks the Health Care Select Sector Index.

2150,PFE,"Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc. (CNAT  -  Free Report) announced the appointment of Keith W. Marshall as executive vice president, chief operating officer and chief financial officer.Notably, Marshall has over fifteen years of experience in finance, operations and business advisory roles. Also, he was an agent on private placements for private biotechnology companies and an advisor to buyers and sellers in biotechnology as well as pharmaceutical company transactions.Therefore, the company is banking on Marshall’s contributions as it aims at completing its four ongoing phase IIb studies for its lead candidate, emricasan, besides expanding its pipeline.Meanwhile, Conatus is focusing on its efforts to develop emricasan. In January 2016, the company started ENCORE-NF study under the ENCORE program for potential improvements in fibrosis and steatohepatitis in patients with fibrosis caused by Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Top-line data is expected in the first half of 2019.In May 2017, Conatus also initiated another study, ENCORE-LF. It is a phase IIb trial, studying EMRI monotherapy on patients with decompensated NASH cirrhosis. Top-line data from the study is expected in 2019. Going forward, the company plans to initiate a new study — ENCORE-XT — a planned extension study in patients who completed the ENCORE-PH or ENCORE-LF studies with continued monitoring for efficacy, safety, clinical outcomes and health-related quality of life.In fact, the ENCORE studies are being conducted to provide clinically relevant efficacy, dosing, and safety data to support the initial registration of emricasan for chronic administration in patients with NASH cirrhosis and potentially support future label expansion.In December 2016, Conatus signed an exclusive option, collaboration and license agreement with Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) for the worldwide development and commercialization of emricasan, which is a positive. This strategic agreement with Novartis not only lends expertise to Conatus but will also provide the company with much needed funds for the development of emricasan.Yet, Conatus has had its share of pipeline setbacks. In 2008, the FDA had placed a clinical hold on emricasan while it was being developed by Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) due to a preclinical observation. However, the clinical hold was lifted in 2013.Currently, several studies on emricasan are ongoing with data readouts scheduled over next couple of years. Also, stiff competition remains a threat. In fact, several companies like Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report), Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Galectin Therapeutics and Enanta Pharmaceuticals are working on developing treatments for NASH.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2151,PFE,"GlaxoSmithKline plc’s (GSK  -  Free Report) shares have declined 7.9% this year so far, underperforming the 16.2% increase witnessed by the industry.The British pharma and consumer giant’s stock was on a rising trajectory till the announcement of third-quarter results on Oct 25. On the call, Glaxo expressed its interest to purchase Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) consumer healthcare business, which the latter plans to put up for sale. However, Glaxo’s interest in buying Pfizer’s unit raised investor concerns about the acquirer possibly sacrificing a portion of its dividend payment due to the potential buyout. Shares declined sharply thereafter. Since the earnings release, shares of Glaxo have declined 12.4%. Earnings estimates for 2018 also witnessed a decline of 4% in the past 90 days.Meanwhile, persistent challenges like stiff competition, genericization, pricing pressure and slowing growth in emerging markets have been hurting sales. Pricing pressure and competitive dynamics are hurting sales in Glaxo’s respiratory franchise, particularly the older products. Meanwhile, its top-selling product, Advair is also expected to face generic competition in the United States next year, which will further hurt sales. Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) and Hikma Pharmaceuticals are looking to bring generic versions of Advair in the United StaresSales of Advair are already being adversely impacted by pricing and competitive pressure in the United States and generic competition in Europe.The slowdown in sales of the Consumer Healthcare segment this year due to a slowdown in global growth of its key consumer categories is also a concern.However, not everything is going wrong at Glaxo. Its newer respiratory/HIV drugs and vaccines are all doing well and will continue to boost revenues. These new products generated 29% of Glaxo’s Pharmaceuticals and Vaccine sales in the first nine months of 2017. Going ahead, Glaxo expects new pharmaceutical and vaccine products including contributions from Shingrix to deliver sales of £6 billion per annum by 2018.Meanwhile, Glaxo has made significant progress with its late-stage pipeline. We think Glaxo possesses one of the stronger late-stage pipelines in large-cap pharma. The company is focused on oncology, immuno-inflammation, HIV and respiratory therapeutic areas. By 2020, the company plans to terminate, partner or divest about 30 pre-clinical and clinical programs and instead allocate 80% of capital to priority programs in two current areas — Respiratory and HIV/infectious — and two potential areas - Oncology and Immuno-inflammation.Recent back-to-back approvals of three new products — Trelegy Ellipta (only once-daily single inhaler triple therapy for COPD), Shingrix vaccine (prevention of shingles) and Juluca  (first dual treatment for HIV) —  have strengthened Glaxo’s competitive position.We would like to see if Glaxo’s strong pipeline, consistent outperformance of new HIV drugs and vaccines, three new products, and cost cuts can bring it back on track next year.Glaxo has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Another large-cap pharma stock that has declined this year is Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) due to several notable pipeline setbacks this year.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

2152,PFE,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) and its Germany-based partner Merck KGaA  announced that a phase III study evaluating their key pipeline candidate, avelumab, for the treatment of gastric cancer in the third-line setting, failed to meet the primary endpoint.The JAVELIN Gastric 300 trial study evaluated avelumab monotherapy for the treatment of unresectable, recurrent or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma in patients whose disease progressed following two prior therapeutic regimens, regardless of PD-L1 expression. The study failed to demonstrate superior overall survival – the primary endpoint – of avelumab treatment over chemotherapy.Though this study evaluating avelumab use in a hard-to-treat patient population failed, the other gastric cancer study — JAVELIN Gastric 100 — continues. It is evaluating avelumab in the first-line switch maintenance setting.Shares of Pfizer have risen 10.4% this year compared with a 15.3% increase for the Large-Cap Pharma industry. Avelumub, a human anti-PD-L1 antibody, received FDA approval for metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a rare form of skin cancer, in March and for advanced bladder cancer in May, to be marketed by the trade name of Bavencio. Bavencio was also approved in EU and Japan in September for MCC.Meanwhile, avelumab is being evaluated for different types of cancers both as monotherapy and in combination with other portfolio assets. Pfizer has also initiated avelumab double/triple combination studies for chemotherapy and targeted therapies and has eleven avelumab combination therapies with immuno-oncology agents under development.Currently, avelumab is being developed for more than 15 types of tumors including gastric/gastroesophageal junction, head and neck, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-small cell lung, ovarian, renal cell carcinoma and others. These studies are part of the JAVELIN development program. Bavencio is considered to be a key long-term growth driver for Pfizer.Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2153,PFE,"GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) along with partner Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that its HIV-focused company, ViiV Healthcare, has initiated a phase III program to evaluate combination of long-acting, injectable cabotegravir and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) rilpivirine for treating adults with virally suppressed HIV-1 infection.Shares of GlaxoSmithKline have underperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has lost 7.7%, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s 15.3% rally during the period.The ATLAS-2M trials comprise the third phase III study undertaken by ViiV Healthcare to investigate a two-drug regimen for the treatment of HIV. The phase III program is designed to evaluate non-inferior antiviral activity of the combination regimen at 48 weeks when administered every 8 weeks versus every 4 weeks. The study will also evaluate pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of the combination therapy. Preliminary data from the study is anticipated in 2019.Notably, ViiV Healthcare was formed in November 2009 by GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer. The partners were later joined by Shionogi in October 2012.We remind investors that another phase III ATLAS study is already evaluating the monthly dosing of the combination regimen in virally suppressed patients, while the FLAIR study is evaluating the combination in the first-line setting. Outcomes from the study are expected in 2018.Notably, last week, GlaxoSmithKline and partner J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report) announced the FDA approval for Juluca, a two-drug complete regimen of Tivicay/rilpivirine and Edurant/dolutegravir as a single tablet for treating HIV-1 infection. Most medicines for HIV treatment are made up of three or more antiretroviral drugs. Juluca is the first two-drug regimen that reduces the number of medicines HIV patients take without compromising on the efficacy of a conventional three-drug regimen.Meanwhile, several companies are working on developing drugscombination regimens to treat HIV. Gilead's (GILD  -  Free Report) bictegravir single table regimen (STR) is under priority review in the United States. The FDA is expected to announce its decision in February next year.To the uninitiated, Mylan has received a tentative approval to treat HIV from the FDA for its combination tablet comprising efavirenz, lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.With companies increasingly developing drugs to treat this life-threatening disease, competition has intensified manifold in the space.GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price | GlaxoSmithKline PLC QuoteZacks RankGlaxoSmithKline carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2154,PFE,"After the drug pricing issue crippled its performance last year, the drug/biotech industry, except for a small correction recently, has witnessed a turnaround this year. Stocks with large market cap have done particularly well. After declining 5.2% last year, the Large Cap Pharma industry has risen 15.3% this year so far with a number of things going in its favor.Strong quarterly results, new product sales ramp up with rising demand, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results, more frequent FDA approvals and continued strong performance of legacy products played a pivotal role in bringing the large-cap drug sector back on track this year.Most drug companies with a larger market cap have seen their share price rising this year. AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report), Novo Nordisk (NVO  -  Free Report), Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) have even outperformed the industry. However, a couple of large-cap pharma companies have witnessed a downside this year. We discuss them below.Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report)While Merck was one of the very few companies whose shares were up last year notwithstanding the industry’s decline, it’s the other way round this year. Shares of Merck have declined 7.3% this year so far.Merck has suffered some notable pipeline setbacks this year. In October, Merck decided not to seek approval for its CETP inhibitor anacetrapib for cholesterol management as its clinical profile was not strong enough to support regulatory filings.Last month, the company also announced a delay in the readout from an important lung cancer study to 2019. This was due to the inclusion of overall survival as a co-primary endpoint in the KEYNOTE-189 phase III study of Keytruda in first-line lung cancer. This raised investor concern, as the delay in the readout can give competitors a chance to gain strength in the lung cancer market.In October, Merck also withdrew a regulatory application in Europe, which was looking to get Keytruda approved as first-line combination therapy for lung cancer.In September, Merck discontinued the development of two of its HCV combination programs — MK-3682B and MK-3682C — saying that the HCV market is becoming extremely crowded. Also, three combination studies of Keytruda for multiple myeloma were placed on clinical hold following reports of death in Keytruda groups in July. Keytruda is seen as a key long-term growth driver at Merck and such setbacks do not bode well for the company.It remains to be seen if the strong performance of its new drugs, particularly Keytruda, its strong vaccines and animal health business and cost saving efforts can help Merck pick up from here.GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report)Shares of Glaxo are down 7.7% this year so far.The stock was on a rising trajectory till the announcement of third-quarter resultson Oct 25. On the third-quarter conference call, Glaxo expressed its interest to purchase Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) consumer healthcare business, which the latter plans to put up for sale. However, Glaxo’s interest in buying Pfizer’s unit raised investor concerns about the acquirer possibly sacrificing a portion of its dividend payment due to the potential buyout.

Pricing pressure and competitive dynamics are hurting sales in Glaxo’s respiratory franchise, particularly the older products. Meanwhile, its top-selling product, Advair is also expected to face generic competition in the United States next year, which will further hurt sales. The slowdown in sales of the Consumer Healthcare segment this year is also a concern.We would like to see if Glaxo’s strong pipeline, consistent outperformance of new HIV drugs and vaccines, three new products — Trelegy Ellipta, Shingrix and Juluca — that have boosted its portfolio lately, and cost cuts can bring it back on track next year.Both Merck and Glaxo have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2155,PFE,"We expect Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report), a well-known name in the multiple sclerosis (MS) market, to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 15.60%.Biogen’s shares have risen 21.4% this year, better than the industry’s growth of 12.4% in the same time frame.Biogen’s earnings performance has been pretty impressive so far, having delivered a positive surprise in each of the last four quarters. The average earnings beat over the last four quarters is 6.41%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderGlobal patient growth is driving prescription trends and sales of Biogen’s MS drugs. We expect the trend to continue in the third quarter. However, rising competition from Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) newly launched MS drug Ocrevus may hurt sales of Tysabri modestly as in the second quarter. The Zacks Consensus estimate for key MS drugs, Tysabri and Tecfidera are $479 million and $1.08 billion, respectively.Meanwhile, the combined number of patients using Avonex and Plegridy will continue to decline with patients transitioning to other oral MS therapies as well as due to higher discounts and allowance.Spinraza, approved for spinal muscular atrophy in December 2016, witnessed faster-than-anticipated adoption in the United States in the first half backed by robust underlying demand. In June/July, Spinraza was approved in the EU, Canada and Japan, which should boost sales in Q3. However, at the Q2 call, management had mentioned that Spinraza U.S. sales may slow in the second half, as more difficult-to-treat patients are coming on and patient transition from intensive Spinraza treatment during induction to a less intensive maintenance schedule.Biogen’s biosimilar products — Flixabi (a biosimilar referencing Remicade) and Benepali (a biosimilar referencing Enbrel) — are also generating higher revenues. The trend should continue this quarter as well.Headcount reduction and restructuring initiatives are expected to continue to lower operating expenses.

A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for a likely positive surprise and Biogen has the right mix.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate ($5.72 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($5.68 per share), is +0.71%.

2156,PFE,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) and its Japanese partner Astellas announced that their prostate cancer drug Xtandi met the primary endpoint in a late-stage study, which can expand the label of the drug to include early-stage patients.Top-line data from the phase III PROSPER study showed that treatment with Xtandi plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) led to a statistically significant improvement in metastasis-free survival (MFS) – the primary endpoint - in men with castration-resistant non-metastatic prostate cancer (CRPC) compared to ADT alone.Many prostate cancer patients with non-metastatic CRPC – an earlier stage of prostate cancer – can experience disease progression despite ADT. However, presently no FDA approved treatment options are available to cater to this condition until these patients develop metastatic disease.Xtandi is presently approved for the treatment of metastatic CRPC in patients who have previously received docetaxel. If approved for the non-metastatic patient population, the label of Xtandi can be expanded to cover all patients with CRPC.Shares of Pfizer were up almost 2% in response to the positive news. However, Pfizer’s shares have underperformed the industry this year so far. The stock has returned 10% during this period, comparing unfavorably with an increase of 16% for the industry.Pfizer plans to discuss the PROSPER study data with the FDA and other regulatory authorities and also present detailed data at a future medical meeting.Xtandi was added to Pfizer’s portfolio with the acquisition of Medivation in September. While Pfizer sells Xtandi in the United States in partnership with Astellas, the latter owns the marketing right outside U.S. markets. Pfizer recorded Xtandi alliance revenues of $141 million in the second quarter and $131 million in the first.In December 2016, Pfizer and Astellas had announced that a phase IV study — PLATO — evaluating the efficacy and safety of continued treatment with Xtandi did not meet the primary endpoint. The PLATO study evaluated Xtandi plus Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Zytiga and prednisone compared to Zytiga and prednisone alone.Xtandi is a key drug in Prizer’s oncology portfolio/pipeline. The New York-based pharma giant is aggressively working on expanding the labels of its marketed cancer drugs like Xtandi, Ibrance and Xalkori.Xtandi is in several studies including late-stage studies in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. It is also in mid-stage development for the treatment of advanced breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma.Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2157,PFE,"Companies like Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) were in the news this week – while Pfizer is mulling strategic options for its Consumer Healthcare business, Merck said that it will not file its CETP inhibitor.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesPfizer to Divest Consumer Healthcare Segment? Pfizer is currently reviewing different strategic options for its Consumer Healthcare business which includes a full or partial separation via a spin off or sale. The company could also ultimately decide to retain the business. This is not the first time that Pfizer has decided to spin off or sell a non-core business segment. Some of the strategic steps taken by Pfizer include the sale of the Hospira infusion systems business to ICU Medical (February 2017), the spin-off of the animal health business that led to the creation of Zoetis (2013) as well as the divestment of the nutrition business to Nestle in 2012. Before that, Pfizer had sold off its Capsugel business to an affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.The divestment of the Consumer Healthcare business would help Pfizer focus on its Innovative Health segment and would also bring in funds that the company could use for returning value to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends (Read more: Pfizer Considering Sale/Spin-Off of Consumer Healthcare Unit).Pfizer is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. The company has gained 11.9% year to date, compared to the 18.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.Merck Collaborates with KalVista: Clinical-stage pharma company, KalVista Pharmaceuticals saw its shares shoot up 38.6% on a collaboration agreement with Merck for KVD001 and future oral diabetic macular edema (“DME”) compounds based on plasma kallikrein inhibition.KVD001, an investigational intravitreal (IVT) injection, is scheduled to move into a phase II proof-of-concept study later this year. Merck has the option to acquire rights to the candidate following the completion of the study. Merck has a similar option for certain other DME candidates.KalVista will receive a non-refundable upfront payment of $37 million as well as payments associated with the exercise of the options by Merck and the achievement of milestones for each program that could add up to $715 million. The company also stands to receive tiered royalties on net sales for candidates commercialized under the deal. Merck also acquired a 9.9% ownership stake in KalVista worth $9.1 million. Another Pipeline Setback for Lilly: Lilly suffered a setback with its recently approved breast cancer drug, Verzenio, failing to meet the primary endpoint in a late-stage study in KRAS-mutated, advanced non-small cell lung cancer.  While the CDK4 and 6 inhibitor failed to meet the primary endpoint of overall survival (“OS”), an analysis of the secondary endpoints of progression-free survival (“PFS”) and overall response rate (“ORR”) showed evidence of monotherapy activity (Read more: Lilly's Verzenio Fails in Phase III Lung Cancer Study).Meanwhile, Verzenio has been granted priority review by the FDA for use in the initial treatment of advanced breast cancer. This means a response from the agency should be out within eight months of receiving the regulatory application instead of the usual timeframe of 12 months.J&J Seeks FDA Nod for New Prostate Cancer Treatment: Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen Biotech is seeking FDA approval for apalutamide, an investigational, next generation oral androgen receptor (“AR”) inhibitor for men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (“CRPC”). There is significant unmet need for this patient population given the absence of FDA approved treatments for these patients.Prostate cancer, the most common cancer among American men, is expected to be diagnosed in more than 161,000 men in 2017, as per the American Cancer Society.Apalutamide became a part of J&J’s pipeline following its 2013 acquisition of privately-held Aragon Pharmaceuticals. Apalutamide’s approval would strengthen and expand J&J’s presence in the prostate cancer market – the company currently sells Zytiga, which is approved for use in combination with prednisone for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (“mCRPC”). J&J is looking to expand Zytiga’s label into earlier stages of metastatic prostate cancer.Allergan Settles Restasis Litigation with InnoPharma: Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) entered into a settlement agreement with InnoPharma related to litigation regarding Restasis patents. The challenged patents are listed in the Orange Book and are scheduled to expire on Aug 27, 2024.Under the settlement agreement, InnoPharma can start selling a generic version of the eye drug in the United States from Feb 24, 2024 or earlier under certain circumstances. Moreover, under certain circumstances, InnoPharma will be allowed to launch an authorized generic version of Restasis on Aug 28, 2024.Allergan is adopting different ways of protecting Restasis from generic competition. The company recently came under fire for entering into an agreement with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, with lawmakers questioning the unconventional move adopted by the company to protect the blockbuster eye drug from generic competition. Restasis is Allergan’s second best-selling drug bringing in sales of almost $1.5 billion in 2016. Lawmakers pointed out that the sovereign status of Native American tribes would make any patent challenges lengthy and complex as tribes may be immune from the legal claims made by generic drug makers to challenge patents. In fact, the Tribe is filing to dismiss the ongoing inter partes review (“IPR”) of the Restasis patents based on their sovereign immunity from IPR challenges.The deal with the Tribe has basically raised concerns that it will curb generic competition in the pharmaceutical industry and discourage generic drugmakers from making cheaper copy-cat versions of expensive drugs. Allergan has been asked by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to provide certain documents and information about the deal by Oct 17, 2017.Merck Will Not File Anacetrapib: Merck has decided that it will not seek regulatory approval for its investigational CETP inhibitor, anacetrapib. The company’s decision was based on a thorough review of the clinical profile of the drug. We note that Merck is not the first company to drop a CETP inhibitor from its plans. Companies like Lilly, Roche and Pfizer have all had high profile setbacks with their CETP inhibitors and the class was more or less written off (Read more: Merck Will Not Seek Approval for CETP Inhibitor Anacetrapib).CRL for AcelRx’s Dsuvia: AcelRx Pharmaceuticals’s (ACRX  -  Free Report) shares plunged 59.8% with the company getting a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) from the FDA for Dsuvia (sufentanil sublingual tablet). The FDA said that it cannot approve the regulatory application in its current form and has asked for additional safety data. The agency has also asked the company to make certain changes to the Directions for Use to ensure the proper administration of the tablet. AcelRx has been asked to validate the same through a human factors study. AcelRx is looking to get Dsuvia approved for the reduction of moderate-to-severe acute pain and dosing errors associated with IV administration via its non-invasive single-dose applicator (“SDA”) in medically supervised settings.PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index gained 0.5% this week.

2158,PFE,"Several important developments were reported this week with key highlights including the termination of a hepatitis C virus deal, the approval of the first cancer biosimilar in the United States and the presentation of data by companies like Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) among others.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesAchillion Down on HCV Deal Termination: Achillion Pharmaceuticals’s (ACHN  -  Free Report) shares fell on the termination of the company’s partnership agreement with Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen Pharmaceuticals for hepatitis C virus (""HCV""). Janssen said that it will not continue with the development of JNJ-4178, a combination of three direct acting antivirals: AL-335, odalasvir and simeprevir. The decision to discontinue development does not come as a big surprise given the intense competition and pricing dynamics in the HCV market. Achillion intends to focus on the development of advanced multiple small molecule factor D inhibitors of the complement alternative pathway (Read more: Achillion's HCV Partnership with J&J Terminated, Stock Falls).First Cancer Biosimilar Gets FDA Nod: The FDA approved Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) and Amgen’s Mvasi, a biosimilar version of Roche’s blockbuster cancer drug, Avastin (bevacizumab). Mvasi can be used for all eligible indications of the reference product. Approval was in line with expectations considering the favorable vote the biosimilar got from an FDA advisory panel recently. The approval is quite a boost for the companies as well as the effort to lower drug prices though so far biosimilars are yet to make a significant dent in referenced product sales in the United States. Mvasi is under review in the EU.Pfizer’s Xtandi PROSPERs in Late-Stage Study: Pfizer and partner Astellas Pharma could well be on the path to boost sales of their prostate cancer drug, Xtandi, with the companies announcing positive top-line data from a late-stage study (PROSPER) in patients with non-metastatic (M0) castration-resistant prostate cancer (""CRPC""). The companies plan to discuss this data with regulatory authorities for the expansion of the drug’s label. Xtandi sales, which have been under pressure, should receive a boost on approval for this patient population.Bristol-Myers Signs Deal, Presents Cancer Data: Bristol-Myers Squibb presented data at the European Society for Medical Oncology (""ESMO"") 2017 Congress showing that treatment with Opdivo led to superior recurrence-free survival (35%) compared to Yervoy in patients with resected high-risk melanoma (Read more: Bristol-Myers Reports Positive Results from Melanoma Study).Meanwhile, the company has signed a deal with Halozyme for the latter’s ENHANZE technology. The global collaboration and license agreement is focused on the use of Halozyme’s technology for the subcutaneous administration of Bristol-Myers’s immuno-oncology drugs thereby providing patients with more flexible and convenient treatment delivery options.Bristol-Myers will shell out $105 million upfront plus make future milestone and royalty payments. The dilutive transaction is expected to hit Bristol-Myers’s 2017 and 2018 earnings by a penny and 2019 earnings by five cents.Lilly’s Baricitinib Fares Well in Mid-Stage Eczema Study: Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and Incyte presented new safety and efficacy data from a mid-stage study on baricitinib for eczema at the annual meeting of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (""EADV""). Baricitinib, when combined with a mid-potency topical corticosteroid (""TCS""), significantly improved the signs and symptoms of eczema compared to TCS alone. The companies intend to commence a phase III program for the eczema indication later this year. Baricitinib is currently approved in the EU under the trade name Olumiant for moderate-to-severe-active rheumatoid arthritis. However, approval is yet to come in the United States where a regulatory filing will be resubmitted by Jan 2018. Lilly stock has gained 12.9% year to date, compared to the 16% rally of the industry it belongs to.Teva Appoints New CEO: Teva (TEVA  -  Free Report) has finally ended its search for a Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) with the company announcing the appointment of Kare Schultz as the company’s President and CEO. A seasoned veteran in the healthcare industry, Schulz will bring with him almost thirty years of experience in this segment. Schulz was recently serving as the President and CEO of H. Lundbeck A/S, where he was responsible for implementing significant restructuring initiatives and launching a robust turnaround strategy. Schulz has a daunting task ahead of him considering the challenges being faced by Teva including generic pricing erosion. The company needs to work on paying down debt, divesting non-core businesses to increase focus on core areas and generate cash, delivering on the pipeline and getting the U.S. generics business back on track (Read more: Teva Hires Kare Schultz as CEO: Is a Recovery in the Cards?).Positive FDA Panel Vote for Glaxo’s Shingles Vaccine: GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) got a positive vote from the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (“VRBPAC”) for Shingrix for the prevention of herpes zoster (shingles) in adults ages 50 and over. Given the positive vote, chances of gaining approval look pretty high. We note that Merck’s Zostavax, a live attenuated virus vaccine is currently available for the prevention of shingles in the same patient population (Read more: Glaxo's Shingles Candidate Gets Positive FDA Committee Vote).Glaxo is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

2159,PFE,"Until 2014, very few options were available to treat ovarian cancer and these primarily included chemotherapy, radiation or surgery. Though effective, these treatments had many side-effects. While chemotherapy can destroy a patient’s immune system, radiation kills normal cells along with cancerous cells. A surgical process is ineffective when the cancer spreads. With the approval of AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report)/Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Lynparza in December 2014, a new targeted therapy for treating ovarian cancer came into the market. The drug inhibits an enzyme in cells – PARP – which helps repair the DNA of the cell, thus destroying the cell.After that, two other PARP-inhibitors were approved by the FDA - Tesaro, Inc.’s (TSRO  -  Free Report) Zejula and Clovis Oncology, Inc.’s (CLVS  -  Free Report) Rubraca. PARP inhibitors have shown more tolerability and effectiveness in clinical studies. However, none of the three marketed PARP inhibitors – Rubraca, Zejula and Lynparza – have been approved in the first-line setting to date.There are many other companies developing PARP inhibitors including Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) and AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report), among others.Let’s see how the marketed drugs are performing and which one has better prospects.Lynparza with its recent label expansion in August 2017 is indicated for maintenance treatment of patients suffering from platinum-sensitive recurrent (“PSR”) ovarian cancer regardless of BRCA-mutation status. It is also approved for BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer beyond the third-line setting. The drug is available in capsule and tablet formulations. The drug recorded sales of $70 million in 2015, $94 million in 2016 and $197 million in the first nine months of 2017, growing over 65% annually. The drug is also being developed as first-line maintenance treatment for BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer. AstraZeneca and Merck expect to file for label expansion by mid-2018.However, Lynparza sales have fallen lately in the United States after the launch of Zejula in April this year. The label expansion in August – including ovarian cancer patients regardless of BRCA-mutation – has brought it on par with Zejula. Moreover, a potential approval in first-line setting next year will give it an edge over the other drugs. Also, AstraZeneca has collaborated with Merck to co-develop Lynparza in combination immunotherapies. Its successful development will be a boon for patients.Rubraca received accelerated approval from the FDA late last year as monotherapy in advanced ovarian cancer patients with deleterious BRCA mutation, treated with two or more chemotherapies. Clovis is conducting confirmatory studies to convert this approval to a full approval. Meanwhile, the company filed a supplemental New Drug Application last month, seeking label expansion as a maintenance treatment for patients with PSR ovarian cancer. Rubraca is under review in EU. The drug reported sales of $38.5 million in the first nine months of 2017. However, the drug may lag the other two drugs as they are approved to treat ovarian cancer irrespective of the BRCA-mutation. Meanwhile, Clovis is evaluating the drug in a phase III study in combination with Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo as first-line maintenance therapy in stage III/IV high-grade ovarian cancer patients who were treated with platinum-based chemotherapy.Zejula is the first PARP-inhibitor, which was approved as maintenance treatment for recurrent ovarian cancer regardless of BRCA-mutation and was launched in April 2017. As the drug can be used in patients who do not have BRCA mutations, it can be prescribed to a broader patient population. Moreover, it also removes the requirement of diagnosis for BRCA-mutation, thereby reducing treatment cost and time.Due to this competitive advantage, Zejula has registered impressive growth since its launch and has also encroached upon Lynparza & Rubraca’s market share. The drug has generated sales of $65.3 million since its launch. The company has also claimed that it is the most frequently prescribed PARP inhibitor for ovarian cancer. Further boosting the prospect of the drug, the European Commission granted marketing authorization earlier this week. TESARO is also developing Zejula in combination with Merck’s anti-PD-1 drug, Keytruda, in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.From the above discussion, it is evident that Zejula has an edge due to non-requirement of BRCA-mutation status and has fared better thus far. However, with an expanded label, Lynparza is set to get back its lost share. We believe that Rubraca could be in a relatively weaker position among the three drugs. There is uncertainty over how it performs in Europe as both Lynparza and Zejula are already approved there. However, we have to wait till 2018 end to see the actual performance of these drugs as a few label expansions are expected next year.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2161,PFE,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and partner GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) announced FDA approval for Juluca, a two-drug complete regimen of Tivicay/rilpivirine and Edurant/dolutegravir as a single tablet for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.Tivicay, a novel investigational integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), is marketed by ViiV Healthcare, an HIV company majorly owned by Glaxo and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report). Edurant, on the other hand, is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) marketed by Janssen, J&J’s pharma arm. Juluca has been developed under a partnership between ViiV Healthcare and Janssen.This year so far, J&J’s share price is up 20.1%. This compares favorably with 14.1% increase witnessed by the industry.Coming back to the latest news, Juluca’s approval was based on data from two phase III SWORD studies. Data from these studies published in February this year showed that the combination of dolutegravir/rilpivirine antiretroviral was as effective as a three- or four-drug antiretroviral regimen as a maintenance therapy in HIV patients who have already achieved viral suppression.Juluca, the first two-drug regimen to be approved, reduces the number of medicines HIV patients take without compromising on the efficacy of a conventional three-drug regimen.We remind investors that Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) bictegravir single table regimen (STR) for HIV treatment is under priority review in the United States. The FDA is expected to announce its decision in February next year. The STR is a fixed-dose combination of bictegravir, an INSTI, and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF), a dual-NRTI backbone. The combination is under review in the EU as well. Gilead’s HIV franchise is a major contributor to sales with approved drugs like Genvoya, Truvada, Atripla, Stribild, Descovy, Odefsey and Complera.J&J carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Pricing pressure and stiff competition are hurting sales of Enbrel, one of the main drivers of Amgen’s revenues. Enbrel has recorded sales of $4.01 billion in 2017 so far, a decline of 7% year over year.The RA market is extremity crowded, given the presence of treatments like AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira and Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xeljanz among others.It remains to be seen if this new device for Enbrel can lead to some improvement in sales. However, on the Q3 conference call, Amgen had said that the declining trends in price and market share will continue in 2018.In Europe, while biosimilar versions of Enbrel are available, in the United States, Sandoz, the generic arm of Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), has received FDA approval for its biosimilar version of Enbrel, Erelzi. Notably, Erelzi is yet to be launched in the United States.Currently, Amgen has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2163,PFE,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved a label expansion for its cancer drug Sutent (sunitinib malate). With this latest approval, Sutent’s label has been expanded as an adjuvant treatment of adult patients at high risk of recurrent renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”) following surgery. This approval makes it the first and only adjuvant therapy for recurrent RCC, the most common type of kidney cancer.Sutent is marketed for the first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).We remind investors that the supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for the drug was accepted by the FDA earlier in May. Subsequently, in September, the drug’s label for the expanded indication got a mixed response from the FDA’s Oncologic Drug Advisory Committee (ODAC). The committee voted six in favor and six against the benefit-risk profile for Sutent for the expanded indication. However, the drug’s label expansion was approved earlier than the target action date in January 2018.Pfizer’s shares have underperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has gained 9.5%, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s 14.7% rally during the period.Notably, the FDA approval was based on positive data from a phase III study (S-TRAC), evaluating Sutent as an adjuvant treatment in patients at high risk of recurrent RCC, following nephrectomy (surgical removal of the cancer-containing kidney). Full data presented in October last year, showed that the trial met the primary endpoint of improving disease-free survival (“DFS”), determined by a blinded independent central review in such patients. Data demonstrated that Sutent extended DFS by 6.8 years compared with 5.6 years in the placebo arm, resulting in an overall risk reduction of 24%.An application for use in the same patient population is also under review in the EU.Significantly, the kidney cancer market is already pretty crowded. The drug faces stiff competition from Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo, Novartis' (NVS  -  Free Report) Afinitor and Votrient, Bayer's and Amgen's Nexavar, Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Avastin and Tecentriq among others.Sutent generated sales of $805 million year to date, down 2% year over year due to competitive pressure. However, with this approval for the expanded patient population, sales of the drug should improve.Per information provided by the company, RCC accounts for around 90% of all kidney cancers. Also, those at high risk of recurrence represent approximately 15% of all patients. It is estimated that 60% of high-risk patients will have RCC recurrence within five years. Hence, the potential market opportunity for the drug is huge for this additional indication.Pfizer, Inc. Price Pfizer, Inc. Price | Pfizer, Inc. QuoteZacks RankPfizer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2165,PFE,"Shares of Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and Astellas Pharma  moved higher in morning trading Thursday after the companies said their new prostate cancer drug, Xtandi, met the main goal of an important clinical trial.Xtandi is actually already approved to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), but today’s results showed statistically significant improvement in the survival rate of men with non-metastatic CRPC.“Many prostate cancer patients who initiate androgen deprivation therapy will experience disease progression illustrated by a rising PSA level, and currently, there are no FDA-approved treatment options for patients with non-metastatic CRPC until they develop confirmed radiographic metastatic disease,” said Carolina Urologic Research Center director Neal Shore, M.D.If Xtandi is approved to treat non-metastatic CRPC, it will create a brand new revenue channel for Pfizer. The drug was added to the pharma giant’s portfolio through the company’s $14 billion acquisition of Medivation last year.With its current approvals, Xtandi witnessed U.S. sales of about $141 million in Pfizer’s most recent quarter. Astellas Pharma, which is based in Japan, owns the rights to distribute the drug outside of the United States.Pfizer shares surged more than 1.8% in early morning trading, hitting an intraday high of $35.74 per share in the process. Shares of Astellas gained as much as 2% to touch an intraday high of $12.90.PFE has now gained more than 6% in the past four weeks, which has helped the stock earn an “A” grade for Momentum in our Style Scores system.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

2166,PFE,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) announced encouraging results from a phase III study, CheckMate -238, on Opdivo.CheckMate 238 is an ongoing phase III, randomized double-blind study of Opdivo versus Yervoy in patients who have undergone complete resection of stage IIIb/c or stage IV melanoma. Results from the study showed that Opdivo 3 mg/kg led to a significant improvement in recurrence-free survival (RFS) compared to Yervoy (ipilimumab) 10 mg/kg in patients with stage IIIb/c or stage IV melanoma following complete surgical resection.The results from the planned interim analysis showed that Opdivo met its primary endpoint, with a statistically significant improvement of 35% in RFS compared to Yervoy.In July 2017, the company reported positive results from the same study.Last week, the company reported positive results from a phase III study that evaluated Opdivo plus Yervoy in patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and met its co-primary endpoint.  The study showed superior overall survival compared to current standard of care, Pfizer, Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Sutent in intermediate- and poor-risk patients. Based on a planned interim analysis, an independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended that the study must be stopped early.We note that Opdivo became the first PD-1 inhibitor to be approved for a hematological malignancy — classic Hodgkin lymphoma in both the United States (May 2016) and the EU (November 2016). In November 2016, Opdivo gained the FDA approval for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy.Label expansion into additional indications might give the product access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug. However, Bristol-Myers suffered a setback in January 2017 when it decided not to pursue the accelerated regulatory pathway for the regimen of Opdivo plus Yervoy in first-line lung cancer in the United States based on a review of available data.Currently, Opdivo is facing competitive challenges in the United States. With the FDA approving Merck & Co.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda, for the first-line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, the company is expected to suffer further loss of market share.Meanwhile, the FDA put a partial clinical hold on three clinical trials — CA209602 (CheckMate-602), CA209039 (CheckMate-039) and CA204142. The trials are investigating Opdivo-based combinations in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Bristol-Myers’ stock has gained 7.5% in the year to date against the industry’s 14.5% gain.The FDA put these studies on hold due to risks identified in Keytruda, another anti–PD-1 agent, in patients with multiple myeloma.In addition, concerns from AstraZeneca PLC’s (AZN  -  Free Report) failed study on lung cancer drug Imfinzi loom large on the company’s CheckMate 227 study on Opdivo.Zacks RankBristol-Myers currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2167,PFE,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that it is not going ahead with filing the regulatory applications seeking approval for anacetrapib, a cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor that it had developed for cholesterol management.The stock was down more than 1% on Wednesday. Merck’s shares have risen 8.3% this year so far compared with an 18.3% increase for the industry. Detailed data from a large phase III cardiovascular outcomes study (REVEAL) announced in August showed that anacetrapib and a statin reduced the risk of major coronary events (composite of coronary death, myocardial infarction and coronary revascularization) by 9% relative to placebo in patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease who are already receiving an effective cholesterol treatment.While anacetrapib reduced the risk to 10.8%, the same was 11.8% for patients on a placebo and a statin. However, no significant benefit was observed in reducing the risk of ischemic stroke.Top-line data from the study was announced in June 2017 wherein the company said that the study had met the primary endpoint. It was also said that anacetrapib’s safety profile was in line with that observed in previous studies with the most significant side effect being the accumulation of anacetrapib in adipose or fat tissue for years after taking the drug.Merck had clearly said then that it was not sure whether the data was strong enough to seek approval. Merck said it will consider whether to file regulatory applications with the FDA and other agencies after reviewing the results with external experts. It was apprehended by investors that the accumulation of anacetrapib in fat tissues could get in the way of regulatory approval.Following a thorough evaluation of data and discussions with external experts, Merck decided not to seek approval for anacetrapib as its clinical profile did not support regulatory filings.We remind investors that three previous experimental CETP inhibitors had failed in their respective studies. CETP inhibitors are designed to raise HDL-cholesterol levels or what is known as “good” cholesterol.In 2015, Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report)  terminated the development of its late-stage CETP inhibitor, evacetrapib based on the recommendation of an independent data monitoring committee, which suggested that chances of meeting the primary endpoint were low. Back in 2006, Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) suspended the late-stage development of its CETP inhibitor, torceptrapib, due to safety issues. In 2012, Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) discontinued the development of its CETP inhibitor, dalcetrapib, due to lack of efficacy.Merck carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2168,PFE,"The series of setbacks continues for Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) as the company announced that its phase III JUNIPER study failed to meet the primary endpoint. The study was evaluating Verzenio in advanced non-small lung cancer (""NSCLC"") with KRAS mutation. Shares fell 1% on Tuesday after the announcement.Verzenio received approval for treating metastatic breast cancer last month in patients where the disease progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy.Lilly’s shares are up 17.1% so far this year, slightly underperforming the industry’s gain of 18.3% in the period.The JUNIPER study compared Verzenio with Roche/Astella Pharma’s Tarceva in stage IV lung cancer patients who have progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy and may have received an additional systemic therapy. The study did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival. However, it showed some improvement in secondary endpoints of progression-free survival in patients and overall response rate.A successful completion of the study would have given Verzenio an edge over Pfizer Inc's (PFE  -  Free Report) Ibrance and Novartis AG's (NVS  -  Free Report) Kisqali, which are only approved for breast cancer.Lilly is currently evaluating Verzenio in multiple studies in NSCLC, including a combination therapy with Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda, an anti-PD-1 therapy.We remind investors that Lilly faced two major setbacks in the past one year. These included a complete response letter from the FDA for its rheumatoid arthritis candidate, baricitinib, in April 2017 and a failed study on Alzheimer's candidate solanezumab in November last year.Meanwhile, Lilly is also facing generic competition due to loss of exclusivity for several key drugs including Zyprexa and Cymbalta. Moreover, Alimta is facing competition from immuno-oncology agents in the United States.Given the recent setbacks, generic competition and absence of drugs nearing approval, Lilly may struggle to maintain the growth pace that it has shown so far this year.Eli Lilly and Company Price and Consensus  Eli Lilly and Company Price and Consensus | Eli Lilly and Company QuoteLilly carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"
2170,PFE,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of 67 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 65 cents by 3.1%. Earnings also rose 10% year over year driven by slightly higher sales and lower costs and share count.The pharma heavyweight delivered revenues of $13.17 billion, which were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues rose 1% from the year-ago quarter on a reported as well as operational basis.Sales in DetailCurrency movement hurt Pfizer’s third-quarter revenues slightly ($54 million) while the divestiture of Hospira infusion systems business hurt sales by 2% in the quarter. In February 2017, Pfizer divested its Hospira infusion systems (HIS)business to ICU Medical, Inc. (ICUI  -  Free Report). Excluding currency headwinds and HIS revenues, sales rose 4%.Strong performance of newer products like Ibrance (breast cancer), Xtandi (prostate cancer) and Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis) offset lower sales of Enbrel, Viagra and the Prevnar/Prevenar 13 vaccines franchise and loss of exclusivity for some products.International revenues rose 2% (up 3% an operational basis) to $6.63 billion. Meanwhile, U.S. revenues were flat at $6.53 billion.Segment DiscussionPfizer’s reporting segments are Pfizer Innovative Health (IH) and Pfizer Essential Health (EH).Pfizer IH sales grew 11% on a reported and operational basis from the year-ago period to $8.12 billion. Pfizer IH revenues were driven by persistently strong momentum of Ibrance and Eliquis globally and growth of Lyrica and Xeljanz primarily in the United States.While Ibrance revenues rose 60% to $878 million in the quarter, Xeljanz rose 48% to $348 million. Lyrica sales rose 10% to $1.15 billion. Eliquis alliance revenues and direct sales rose 43% to $644 million.Revenues from the blockbuster prostate cancer drug, Xtandi, added to Pfizer’s portfolio following the September 2016 Medivation acquisition, also contributed to U.S. revenues. Xtandi recorded alliance revenues of $150 million in the quarter compared with $141 million in the second quarter.This was partially offset by continued decline in revenues from Prevnar 13 in the United States and lower revenues of Enbrel and Viagra.Enbrel revenues declined 13% to $613 million in key European markets due to biosimilar competition. Pfizer has exclusive rights to Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis (RA) drug, Enbrel, outside the United States and Canada. Total Viagra (IH+EH) sales declined 20% to $308 million. Lower demand and wholesaler destocking ahead of the potential generic competition in December hurt sales of Viagra.Global Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 revenues declined 1% to $1.52 billion. Prevnar 13 revenues tanked 4% in the United States due to continued decline in revenues for the eligible adult patient population. However, Prevenar 13 revenues rose 5% in international markets due to favorable timing of government purchases in some emerging markets.Consumer Healthcare revenues rose 4% to $829 million. Global Oncology revenues surged 46% to $1.62 billion driven by Ibrance. Global Vaccine revenues rose 1% to $1.65 billion. Internal Medicine rose 9% to $2.46 billion. The Inflammation & Immunology franchise rose 4% to $1 billion. Additionally, the portfolio of Rare Disease declined 3% to $569 million.Earlier this month, Pfizer said that it is exploring strategic alternatives for its Consumer Healthcare segment including a partial or a full separation through a spin-off, sale or other transaction. A decision is expected next year.Pfizer EH segment sales recorded a decline of 12% (down 11% operationally) to $5.05 billion. Excluding HIS revenues, EH sales declined 7%.EH revenues were hurt by the loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for products primarily Pristiq in the United States and Vfend and Lyrica in Europe, lower revenues from legacy Hospira products due to product shortages and divesture of HIS. However, in the EH business, biosimilars and emerging markets did well in the quarter.Pfizer launched Inflectra, a biosimilar version of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Merck’s blockbuster RA drug Remicade, in November last year. While Inflectra recorded sales of $34 million in the United States and $112 million globally, all other biosimilars brought in sales of $28 million (down 16%) from outside the U.S. markets. Emerging markets revenues grew 7% operationally.Adjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI&A) expenses declined 1% (operationally) in the quarter to $3.48 billion. Adjusted R&D expenses also declined 1% to $1.85 billion.2017 Guidance UpdatedWhile Pfizer raised its adjusted earnings guidance, it tightened the revenue expectations for the year. Revenues are expected in the range of $52.4 billion to $53.1 billion compared with $52 billion to $54 billion expected previously. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $52.65 billion.Adjusted earnings per share are expected in the range of $2.58 - $2.62 compared with $2.54 - $2.60 expected previously. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.56 per share.At the mid-point, adjusted EPS is expected to increase 8% (previously 7%).Research and development expenses are expected in the range of $7.5–$7.8 billion (previously $7.5–$8.0 billion), while SI&A spending is projected in the range of $14.0–$14.5 billion (previously $13.7–$14.7 billion).Our TakePfizer’s third-quarter results were mixed as it beat earnings estimates but delivered in-line sales. However, the company raised its adjusted earnings guidance for the year. Shares were down 0.5% in pre-market trading. So far this year, Pfizer’s shares are up 8.2%, comparing unfavorably with an increase of 14.6% for the industry. Pfizer continues to face headwinds in the form of genericization of key drugs, lost alliance revenues, pricing pressure and rising competition, which are hurting the top line. Nonetheless, we believe that new products like Ibrance, contribution from acquisitions, cost-cutting efforts and share buybacks should help the company achieve its guidance.Pfizer also boasts a strong pipeline and expects a “multiyear wave of potential new product launches and product line extensions.” Bavencio is being considered a key long-term growth driver for Pfizer.Bavencio/avelumab received FDA approval for metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in March this year and for advanced bladder cancer in May. Bavencio was also approved in EU and Japan in September for MCC.Two other leukemia treatments — Besponsa/inotuzumab ozogamicin for relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Mylotarg for newly diagnosed CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) — were also approvedby the FDA in the third quarter. Besponsa was also approved in the EU in June.Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Pfizer, Inc.

2171,PFE,"Yesterday before the opening bell, the first indictments and first conviction in the Russia collusion scandal in the 2016 U.S. presidential election helped pump the brakes on the extended bull-market rally. Trump’s former campaign manager and a long-time aide face 12 grand jury charges, while a low-level Trump campaign operative has already pled guilty to lying to the FBI. Stock market indexes closed lower Monday, following seven straight up weeks.Whether or not this becomes an albatross on the stock market depends greatly on one’s perspective: Zacks Exec VP Kevin Matras, in his latest Profit from the Pros column this morning, sees the Paul Manafort indictments as little more than a temporary distraction. Those who believe Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller is likely to end his investigation soon and has already exhausted his findings will likely feel the same way: nothing more than a blip, a market breather. Though there does seem to be a greater risk hovering that the Mueller investigation is not wrapping up but just beginning to unfold. If such is the case, market participants may be more trepidatious moving forward.Not today, though: futures for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 are all up in Halloween Tuesday’s pre-market. Far from being spooked, or fear of a “trick,” traders and investors are apparently looking for plenty of “treats.”With good reason, as well: while the Case-Shiller August home sales report is expected to bring 6% growth in U.S. home sales (this is a trailing indicator, but is considered to be the most sound housing data economists see regularly), the Paychex small-business report this morning demonstrates the most stable quarter in the history of the small business index. Though jobs growth has begun to slow, wage increases look to be keeping pace with economic growth. Minneapolis, Denver and Seattle were among the cities seeing the strongest small business growth.And jobs data is expected to be strong, both tomorrow with the private-sector ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) payroll report and Friday’s all-encompassing non-farm payroll report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Even with a hurricane-affected quarter, jobs growth is expected to remain robust, with unemployment remaining around a low-to-mid 4% range, indicative of a very strong domestic labor market.Q3 Earnings RoundupAfter the bell we expect to hear from U.S. Steel (X  -  Free Report) and Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report), but ahead of the opening bell we see plenty of strength in Q3 performance:Mastercard (MA  -  Free Report) outperformed earnings and revenue estimates, posting $1.34 per share on revenues of $3.4 billion topping the $1.23 per share and $3.3 billion expected. Quarterly sales rose 18% year over year, with higher switched transactions in the quarter and cross-border volumes up 15%. Shares are up 1.7% at this hour in the pre-market.BP (BP  -  Free Report) also trounced expectations, reporting 57 cents per share on $60.81 billion in quarterly sales, which easily beat the $8.04 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. Oil production year over year was up 16.4%, and shares of BP rose 2.5% initially upon the quarterly news.Other earnings beats this morning include pharma giant Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and consumer staples major Kellogg (K), which both beat earnings expectations. Pfizer was in-line on its top-line, while Kellogg outperformed our consensus. Both stocks are trading up in today’s pre-market.Under Armour , however, is a much different story: although earnings of 22 cents per share beat estimates by 4 cents, quarterly sales posted a miss. More importantly, revenue and sales guidance were both pointed lower on lower North American demand and other operational challenges. UA stock, which had already fallen more than 40% year to date, are another 14.5% lower ahead of the opening bell.

Those who believe Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller is likely to end his investigation soon and has already exhausted his findings will likely feel the same way: nothing more than a blip, a market breather. Though there does seem to be a greater risk hovering that the Mueller investigation is not wrapping up but just beginning to unfold. If such is the case, market participants may be more trepidatious moving forward.Not today, though: futures for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 are all up in Halloween Tuesday’s pre-market. Far from being spooked, or fear of a “trick,” traders and investors are apparently looking for plenty of “treats.”With good reason, as well: while the Case-Shiller August home sales report is expected to bring 6% growth in U.S. home sales (this is a trailing indicator, but is considered to be the most sound housing data economists see regularly), the Paychex small-business report this morning demonstrates the most stable quarter in the history of the small business index. Though jobs growth has begun to slow, wage increases look to be keeping pace with economic growth. Minneapolis, Denver and Seattle were among the cities seeing the strongest small business growth.And jobs data is expected to be strong, both tomorrow with the private-sector ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) payroll report and Friday’s all-encompassing non-farm payroll report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Even with a hurricane-affected quarter, jobs growth is expected to remain robust, with unemployment remaining around a low-to-mid 4% range, indicative of a very strong domestic labor market.Q3 Earnings RoundupAfter the bell we expect to hear from U.S. Steel (X  -  Free Report) and Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report), but ahead of the opening bell we see plenty of strength in Q3 performance:Mastercard (MA  -  Free Report) outperformed earnings and revenue estimates, posting $1.34 per share on revenues of $3.4 billion topping the $1.23 per share and $3.3 billion expected. Quarterly sales rose 18% year over year, with higher switched transactions in the quarter and cross-border volumes up 15%. Shares are up 1.7% at this hour in the pre-market.BP (BP  -  Free Report) also trounced expectations, reporting 57 cents per share on $60.81 billion in quarterly sales, which easily beat the $8.04 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. Oil production year over year was up 16.4%, and shares of BP rose 2.5% initially upon the quarterly news.Other earnings beats this morning include pharma giant Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and consumer staples major Kellogg (K), which both beat earnings expectations. Pfizer was in-line on its top-line, while Kellogg outperformed our consensus. Both stocks are trading up in today’s pre-market.Under Armour , however, is a much different story: although earnings of 22 cents per share beat estimates by 4 cents, quarterly sales posted a miss. More importantly, revenue and sales guidance were both pointed lower on lower North American demand and other operational challenges. UA stock, which had already fallen more than 40% year to date, are another 14.5% lower ahead of the opening bell.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

2173,PFE,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) said it is exploring strategic alternatives for its Consumer Healthcare segment including a partial or a full separation through a spin-off, sale or other transaction. A decision regarding the same is expected to be made next year and it may ultimately opt to retain the business.Pfizer’s shares have underperformed the industry this year so far. The stock has returned 12.1% during this period, comparing unfavorably with an increase of 18% for the industry.The Consumer Healthcare segment includes several over-the-counter (OTC) healthcare medicines, vitamins, and personal care products, which can be sold without prescriptions. Important products among these are Advil pain relief tablets and Centrum multivitamins, which are two of the top-selling consumer healthcare brands globally. The segment recorded sales of almost 1.7 billion in the first half of 2017, representing growth of 2% year over year.Chief executive officer (CEO) Ian Reed said that the consumer unit is not core to its prescription drug business and its potential value will be “more fully realized outside the company”. Regarding its core pharmaceuticals business, in August, Pfizer said that it expects approximately 25 to 30 drug approvals over the next five years, including around 15 products that have blockbuster potential. These include line-extensions for Xtandi, Ibrance & Xeljanz/XR. Half of these potential blockbusters are expected to receive approval by 2020.The funds from the potential spin-off of the non-pharmaceutical Consumer Healthcare business may make it easier for the company to achieve this goal.It is being apprehended that consumer health biggies like Nestle, Reckitt Benckiser, Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) or Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) may be interested in buying the unit that Pfizer may put on sale.Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2175,PFE,"Pharma and biotech stocks started 2017 on a strong note with this part of the market remaining in favor as the year progresses. So far this year, the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index and the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index are up 25.6% and 14.6%, respectively.With investors being more comfortable with the drug pricing scenario, focus has shifted to the fundamentals of the sector. Although the drug pricing issue will remain a headwind, expectations are that steps taken by the Trump administration to drive down drug prices will not be as draconian as previously expected.  Deregulation and increased competition seem to be some of the ways that will be used to control drug prices. The FDA is working to lower healthcare costs by speeding up the development of next-generation treatments, especially for rare diseases or targeted cancer therapies and is also working on clearing up a backlog of orphan drug applications.The FDA has approved far more drugs this year than it did in the whole of 2016. Key approvals this year include Novartis’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah (the first gene therapy in the United States), Lilly’s Verzenio (advanced or metastatic breast cancer), Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) Vosevi (hepatitis C virus), Puma’s Nerlynx (to reduce the risk of breast cancer returning), J&J’s Tremfya (moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis), Regeneron/Sanofi’s Kevzara (rheumatoid arthritis), Roche’s multiple sclerosis treatment, Ocrevus, Regeneron and Sanofi’s eczema treatment, Dupixent, Tesaro’s PARP inhibitor, Zejula, and BioMarin’s Brineura (treatment of a specific form of Batten disease) among others. Quite a few of these drugs have blockbuster potential.Meanwhile, some other factors that should continue having a positive impact on pharma and biotech stocks are new product sales ramp up, R&D success and innovation, strong results, a higher number of FDA approvals and continued strong performance from legacy products.According to the Zacks Earnings Trends report, the medical sector, which has been among the better performing sectors over the last several quarters, is expected to record earnings growth of 1% on revenue growth of 4.7% in the third quarter.Given this scenario and with medical sector earnings round the corner, it would make sense to look at some pharma and biotech stocks that are expected to report a positive earnings surprise in the quarter.Investing in such stocks could prove beneficial for investors as an earnings beat usually leads to significant share price appreciation.5 Drug Stocks to Keep an Eye on This Earnings SeasonWith the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have zeroed-in on five pharma and biotech stocks that sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) and have a positive Earnings ESP. Earnings ESP is a very valuable tool for investors looking for stocks that are most likely to beat earnings estimates. Moreover, adding a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 has produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. While you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here, you can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report): Pfizer is focused on the development and commercialization of a wide range of medicines and vaccines as well consumer health care products. The company has surpassed earnings expectations in each of the first two quarters of 2017. Key revenue drivers include Ibrance, Eliquis and Xeljanz. Pfizer, which expects 2017 revenues to be affected by about $2.5 billion due to loss of exclusivities (LOEs), is working on bringing new products to market to make up for lost sales. The company has 15 potential blockbusters lined up for the next 5 years with about half of these potentially by 2020. Focus also remains on growing new products like Ibrance, Eliquis and Xeljanz. Meanwhile, the impact of LOEs should continue declining in the coming years (about $2 billion in 2018 as well as 2019, $1 billion - $2 billion in 2020; $1 billion in 2021, and $0.5 billion or less from 2022 to 2025).Pfizer, a Zacks Rank #2 stock, carries a VGM Score of B. The VGM Score is a useful tool that allows investors to gain an insight into a stock’s strengths and weaknesses.Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 offer the best upside potential.This company, which will be reporting third quarter results on October 31, has an earnings ESP of +0.84%.Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report): Lilly, which has a strong presence in the pharmaceuticals as well as animal health segments, is slated to report third quarter 2017 results on October 24. This Zacks Rank #3 stock has an earnings ESP of +4.46% for the third quarter. Lilly surpassed earnings expectations in the first two quarters of 2017. Although the company is facing challenges including generic competition, new products should drive results. Lilly has several important pipeline catalysts lined up for the coming quarters as well. Estimated earnings growth for the current year is 17.9%.Lilly has gained 18.4% year to date, compared to the 18% rally of the industry it belongs to.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX  -  Free Report): Vertex, a key player in the cystic fibrosis (CF) market, surpassed earnings expectations in three of the last four quarters with an average surprise of 17.9%. The company holds a strong position in the CF market with two products, Orkambi and Kalydeco, in its portfolio. Early in August, Vertex had said that it expects its CF franchise to deliver revenues of $1.87 billion - $2.1 billion in 2017 including Orkambi revenues of $1.1 billion - $1.3 billion.The company is working on expanding its CF portfolio and is currently seeking both FDA and EMA approval for a tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination. With the FDA granting priority review, a response should be out by Feb 28, 2018.Vertex, a Zacks Rank #1 stock, has gained 111.1% year to date, substantially outperforming the 13.9% rally of the industry it belongs to. The company, which is expected to report third quarter results on October 24, has an Earnings ESP of +2.56% for the quarter.Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report): Biogen is a key name in the multiple sclerosis (“MS”) market with several approved products like Tecfidera, Tysabri and Avonex in its portfolio. The company also has a spinal muscular atrophy product (Spinraza) in its portfolio and is working on developing treatments for diseases like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Biogen’s earnings track record is good with the company surpassing earnings expectations in each of the last four quarters with an average surprise of 6.4%. The company, which is scheduled to report third quarter results on October 24, has an Earnings ESP of +0.32%. Over the last 7 days, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter and current-year earnings being revised 0.5% and 0.2%, respectively.Biogen, a Zacks Rank #3 stock, has gained 16% year to date, outperforming the 13.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.Merck (MRK  -  Free Report): Merck, a Zacks Rank #3 stock, has consistently surpassed earnings expectations over the last four quarters with an average surprise of 8.1%. The company will be reporting Q3 earnings on October 27 - earnings ESP for Q3 is +0.28%. Although the company does have challenges in the form of generic competition as well as safety issues related to some studies being conducted with Keytruda, new products like Keytruda and the strong performance of the base business should provide support. Merck also has a deep pipeline which bodes well for long-term growth.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

2176,PFE,"AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) shares increased almost 2% after the company announced that its oral JAK-1 selective inhibitor, upadacitinib (ABT-494), met primary endpoints in a phase III study for treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).In fact, AbbVie’s shares have rallied 38.9%, outperforming the industry’s 15.8% rise so far this year.The phase III SELECT-BEYOND study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group study. It is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two doses (15 mg and 30 mg) of upadacitinib compared with placebo over 12 weeks in patients with moderate-to-severe RA, who are on a stable dose of conventional synthetic DMARDs and have had shown an inadequate response to the dosage.The study met its primary endpoints with highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful results for both the doses as compared to placebo. The trial’s primary endpoints were ACR20 responses and low disease activity (LDA).The results showed that 65% of patients, receiving 15 mg and 56% of patients, administered with 30 mg dose once daily of upadacitinib, achieved ACR20 responses after 12 weeks of treatment in comparison to 28% of patients receiving placebo.LDA was achieved by 43% and 42% of patients in the 15 mg and 30 mg dose arms, respectively, compared with 14% of patients receiving placebo. Additionally, the study met its secondary endpoints too.Notably, SELECT-BEYOND is the second out of the six ongoing phase III studies in the SELECT RA clinical trial program, conducted on upadacitinib.Other researches are also underway for upadacitinib for treating Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and atopic dermatitis.We remind investors that last week, the company announced upadacitinib to having met primary endpoints in a phase IIb study for atopic dermatitis. The company plans to advance the candidate into phase III studies next year for the given indication.We note that AbbVie already has a strong presence in the RA market with its blockbuster drug, Humira. However, several companies are working on developing biosimilar versions of Humira which could induce competition in the market for the company. Also, the RA market is extremely crowded including drugs like Johnson & Johnson’s Simponi and UCB’s Cimzia among others.Significantly, Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) JAK inhibitor, Olumiant, was recently approved in the EU and Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xeljanz is marketed in the United States for treating RA, which might pose a strong competition for upadacitinib on approval.Also, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) has already received approval to market a Humira biosimilar but the drug has not been launched yet due to ongoing litigation. If upadacitinib is approved, it may reduce the potential negative impact of Humira generics on AbbVie’s top line.AbbVie Inc. PriceAbbVie Inc. Price | AbbVie Inc.

2177,PFE,"Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) is one of the most well-known names in the pharmaceutical sector not just for its medicines and vaccines but also for its consumer healthcare products. This New York-based company is well known for products like Prevnar, Lyrica, Lipitor and Celebrex among others.However, like many of its peers, PFE is facing generic competition and pricing pressure for several products like Lipitor, Norvasc, Protonix, Camptosar, Celebrex and Zoloft.

2179,PFE,"U.S. equity markets are going through turbulent times. There is a lot of volatility and uncertainty owing to rising geopolitical risks and political uncertainty. This has increased the appeal for dividend investing.Geopolitical RisksNorth Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test, that of a hydrogen bomb, which can be mounted on an Inter Continental Ballistic Missile, on Sep 3, 2017. Kim Jong-Un’s actions have created huge unrest in a number of Asian economies and the United States.U.S. President Donald Trump has been suggesting that Kim Jong-Un’s threats will be met with military actions if he threatens to harm U.S. territories or any of its allies. US ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, said that North Korea is “begging for war” and has urged the U.N. to impose strictest sanctions on the rogue nation (read: Safe Haven Currency ETFs Gain, Dollar Loses Amid Geopolitical Uncertainty).Political RisksThere is increased uncertainty with regard to Trump’s ability to pass the promised legislations relating to tax reform and deregulation. Although economic fundamentals have been strong, there are renewed doubts over the capabilities of the Trump administration.Economic growth in the United States was better than initially expected by the markets. Per the Commerce Department, economic growth was 3% in second-quarter 2017 compared with its earlier estimate of 2.6% (read: ETFs to Watch on Oil Price Rise and Debt Limit Deal).However, in a latest show of bipartisanship, Trump sided with the Democrats, to increase the debt ceiling and fund the government till mid-December. This came as a disappointment for fellow Republicans, who were pushing for a longer extension. Hours before the deal was passed Paul Ryan stated that a shorter debt limit extension would give the Democrats immense leverage over the Republicans, once the debate starts all over again in mid-December.In such a scenario, dividend-paying securities provide consistent income to investors. The uniqueness of these securities is their increase when political uncertainty weighs on markets, more so because apart from high dividend, these securities exhibit less volatility as they are stable and mature companies.Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to U.S. equities with relatively high dividend yields.Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG  -  Free Report)This fund is a low-cost ETF that seeks to provide exposure to large, established U.S. companies providing high dividends.It has AUM of $30.8 billion and charges a fee of 8 basis points a year. From a sector look, the fund has high exposures to Industrials, Consumer Services and Consumer Goods with 31.80%, 14.90% and 14.00% allocation, respectively (as of Jul 31, 2017). The fund’s top three holdings are Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and PepsiCo Inc (PEP  -  Free Report) with 4.4%, 4.2% and 4.1% allocation, respectively (as of Jul 31, 2017).

2180,PFE,"Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) gained about 5% after the company ended its phase III combination study, CheckMate-214, earlier than expected after it met its co- primary endpoint.The phase III study evaluated Opdivo plus Yervoy in patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and met its co-primary endpoint.  The study showed superior overall survival (OS) compared to current standard of care sunitinib (marketed as Sutent by Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) in intermediate- and poor-risk patients.In fact, the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy also met the secondary endpoint of improved overall survival in all randomized patients. Based on a planned interim analysis, an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) recommended that the study be stopped early. But the safety and tolerability of the combination treatment observed in the study was consistent with previous reports of this dosing schedule and similar across subgroups.In August 2017, Bristol-Myers announced top-line results from CheckMate-214 study, where the study met the co-primary endpoint of objective response rate (ORR).  Markedly, the co-primary endpoint of progression-free survival favored the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy versus sunitinib but did not reach statistical significance.Bristol-Myers’ shares have underperformed the industry year to date. The stock has been down 7.5% compared with the industry’s gain of 10.2% in the same time frame.We note that Opdivo became the first PD-1 inhibitor to be approved for a hematological malignancy — classic Hodgkin lymphoma — in the United States (May 2016) and the EU (November 2016).In November 2016, Opdivo gained the FDA approval for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy.In fact, renal cell carcinoma is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults and has a huge unmet medical need. Thus, label expansion into additional indications would give the product access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug.Additionally, the company entered into a collaboration agreement with Seattle Genetics, Inc. (SGEN  -  Free Report) in June 2017. Per the deal, Bristol-Myers will evaluate the combination of Opdivo and Seattle Genetics’ antibody drug conjugate (ADC) Adcetris in a phase III trial as a potential treatment option for patients with relapsed/refractory or transplant-ineligible advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).However, Bristol-Myers suffered a setback in January 2017 when it decided not to pursue the accelerated regulatory pathway for the regimen of Opdivo plus Yervoy in first-line lung cancer in the United States based on a review of available data.Currently, Opdivo is facing competitive challenges in the United States. With the FDA approving Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda, for the first-line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, the company is expected to suffer further loss of market share. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price  Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price | Bristol-Myers Squibb Company QuoteZacks RankBristol-Myers currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2181,PFE,"Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AERI  -  Free Report) is expected report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 1. Last quarter, the company reported a narrowed-than-expected loss.In fact, Aerie’s performance over the last four quarters has been decent. The company reported a narrower-than-expected loss in three of the trailing four quarters while posting wider-than-expected loss in the remaining one, with an average positive surprise of 0.64%. Aerie’s share price has increased 40.8% year to date as against the industry’s 5.6% decline. Earlier in the month, Aerie’s stock price surged on positive news for its lead drug, Rhopressa.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates Aerie to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen which is the case here.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +1.61%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 61 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 62 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Aerie has a Zacks Rank #3, which is favorable. The combination of a Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP indicates a likely positive surprise. Note that we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision.Factors at PlayWith no approved product in its portfolio, Aerie depends heavily on its late-stage candidates — Rhopressa and Roclatan. Hence, we expect investor focus on pipeline updates.Aerie’s lead candidate, Rhopressa, a once-daily formulation for lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) is being evaluated in patients suffering from open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. On Oct 13, the Dermatologic and Ophthalmic Drugs Advisory Committee of the FDA voted in favor of Rhopressa’s approval. The members of the committee unanimously agreed that the trials support the efficacy of netarsudil ophthalmic solution for reducing elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.In addition, majority of the members agreed that the Rhopressa’s efficacy outweigh safety risks.The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act date of Feb 28, 2018. We note that the FDA is not bound by the Advisory Committee’s guidance, but takes its advice into consideration when reviewing drugs.Apart from Rhopressa, Aerie is also evaluating Roclatan. Aerie initiated a phase III study — Mercury 3 in Europe for its other pipeline candidate Roclatan 0.02%/0.005%. Roclatan is a once-daily, quadruple-action fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa and Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xalatan, is being evaluated to lower IOP in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The company plans to submit its NDA for the same in the first half of 2018.The trial is a non-inferiority trial comparing Roclatan to prescribed fixed dose combination of Ganfort (a combination of the bimatoprost along with timolol), marketed by Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) in Europe.We expect investors to focus on further pipeline updates on the call. Cash burn for the year is projected at $110 million, up from $100 million due to further pipeline development.Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

As of Oct 27, 2017, total earnings for the 272 S&P 500 members are up 8.7% from the same period last year on 6.7% higher revenues, with 75.7% and 66.2% surpassing the earnings and revenue estimates, respectively.According to the Earnings Preview, these 272 S&P 500 companies account for 64.2% of the index’s total market capitalization. Per the report, total earnings of the S&P 500 companies in Q3 are expected to grow 5.4% year over year on 5.5% higher revenues.Please note that the broader Medical sector (includes drug, biotech as well as Medical Device companies) is expected to record year-over-year growth of 4.8% in revenues and 5.2% in earnings in Q3.Among the biotech/pharma bigwigs, Merck & Co., Inc.

(GILD  -  Free Report) reported their third-quarter results last week.  While Merck, Celgene and AbbVie outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimates for earnings, they lagged the same for revenues. However, Bristol-Myers and Gilead surpassed expectations for both earnings and revenues.Notably, Bristol-Myers and Gilead raised their earnings outlook for 2017 as well. While Merck raised its previously issued adjusted earnings guidance, it upped sales guidance marginally. Abbvie and Celgene also tightened their earnings guidance for 2017.Here we have three biotech/pharma companies that are set to report third-quarter results on Oct 31.Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) Pfizer, which is scheduled to release earnings before the market opens, delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.08% in the last quarter. The company’s earnings performance has been mixed with the bottom line missing in two of the last four quarters while beating the same in the other two, bringing the average surprise to negative 0.39%.For this quarter, Pfizer has an Earnings ESP of -0.11% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 65 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.New products like Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis) and Ibrance (breast cancer) as well as older products like Lyrica (neuropathic pain) and Eliquis (blood thinner) may contribute to the top line, meaningfully. Meanwhile, sales of blockbuster drug Enbrel will continue to decline in the quarter due to biosimilar competition. The lower sales trend in Prevnar/Prevenar 13 vaccines franchise is likely to continue as well. Sales of Viagra are expected to be affected by lower demand.

2183,PFE,"Israel-based generic drug maker, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report), saw its shares decline 9.4% last week with the company suffering a fresh setback in the form of FDA approval of a generic version of the company’s top-selling branded drug, Copaxone (multiple sclerosis). Mylan NV (MYL  -  Free Report) gained FDA approval for its generic version of the 40 mg (thrice weekly) dosage as well as the once-daily 20 mg formulation of Copaxone. With Mylan being among the first applicants to challenge the 40 mg patent, the company could enjoy 180 days of exclusivity. Mylan has launched both products. Mylan also gained approval for the 40 mg dose in the EU.The FDA approval of generic Copaxone is a major blow for Teva which is currently facing a whole lot of challenges. Teva issued a statement saying that the launch of the 40 mg formulation before the final resolution of pending patent infringement lawsuits with Mylan will be treated as an “at-risk” launch – this means Mylan would have to pay significant damages if the court upholds the patents protecting the drug.Copaxone brought in total sales of $1.99 billion in the first half of 2017. At the end of the second quarter of 2017, Copaxone 40 mg accounted for more than 85% of total Copaxone prescriptions in the United States.The entry of the 40 mg formulation and the entry of a second generic version of the 20 mg formulation (Sandoz and Momenta have been on the market for quite a while with Glatopa, a generic version of the 20 mg dose) is expected to cut Teva’s 4Q earnings by at least 25 cents per share. Additional details should be out when the company announces third quarter results on November 2. The entry of generic Copaxone just adds to the existing list of problems being faced by Teva.Generic pricing erosion remains a huge issue for generic companies like Teva. The sharp decline in generic drug prices, while a blessing for patients, is proving to be a major challenge for generic drugmakers as well as drug distributors.Consolidation in the industry has increased the ability to negotiate lower prices for generic drugs leading to increasing price erosion and decreasing volume. Moreover, the FDA is speeding up the approval of generic drugs which means more competition, increasing price cuts and decreasing volume. Teva said that price erosion was around 6% in the second quarter and is expected to increase to high-single digits over the remainder of the year. All these headwinds will persist for the U.S. Generics unit into the near future, resulting in lower revenue and profit in this segment in 2018 and potentially 2019.Meanwhile, the company said that it does not expect any earnings contribution from its businesses in Venezuela given the significant devaluation of the Venezuelan currency. Teva also cut its dividend by 75%.Teva has many challenges ahead – paying down debt, divesting non-core businesses to increase focus on core areas and generate cash, delivering on the pipeline and getting the U.S. generics business back on track.The company has been working on addressing these issues and recently announced the appointment of a new CEO (Read more: Why Did Teva Pharmaceuticals Stock Soar Today?). Teva has also made significant progress in the divestment of non-core businesses. However, the entry of Copaxone 40 mg is a major setback for the company and it could well be a while before Teva is able to get back on track.Teva is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock. The company has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 1.9% downward over the last 7 days while the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has been revised 5.1% downward over the last 7 days. Teva has lost 56% of its value year to date versus the 20.5% decline of its industry.While Teva deals with these challenges, here is a look at five drug companies that sport a strong Zacks Rank and look well-positioned.Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report): Celgene is focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases. The company has several blockbuster products in its portfolio including Revlimid, Pomalyst, and Otezla. Celgene has a rich and promising pipeline as well with key data readouts lined up for the next two years.Celgene, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, has gained 20.3% year to date, outperforming the 14.1% rally of the industry it belongs to. The company also has a VGM Score of A. The VGM Score is a useful tool that allows investors to gain an insight into a stock’s strengths and weaknesses.Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 offer the best upside potential. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report): Pfizer is focused on the development and commercialization of a wide range of medicines and vaccines as well consumer health care products. During the first half of the year, the company paid $8.9 billion in dividends and share buybacks to its shareholders including a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program.Pfizer, which expects 2017 revenues to be affected by about $2.5 billion due to loss of exclusivities (LOEs), is working on bringing new products to market to make up for lost sales. The company has 15 potential blockbusters lined up for the next 5 years with about half of these potentially by 2020. Focus also remains on growing new products like Ibrance, Eliquis and Xeljanz. Meanwhile, the impact of LOEs should continue declining in the coming years (about $2 billion in 2018 as well as 2019, $1 billion - $2 billion in 2020; $1 billion in 2021, and $0.5 billion or less from 2022 to 2025).Pfizer, a Zacks Rank #2 stock, carries a VGM Score of B.Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report): Amgen, one of the most well-known names in the biotech industry, has a presence in the oncology/hematology, inflammation, nephrology, bone health and cardiovascular disease markets. Key products include Enbrel, Neulasta, Aranesp, Prolia, Xgeva, Epogen, Kyprolis, Repatha, and Blincyto among others. Most of these products are either blockbusters or have blockbuster potential. Amgen has a deep pipeline with the company working on bringing new products to market to combat the impact of potential biosimilar competition for mature products in its franchise. The company has been returning value to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends.Amgen is also a Zacks Rank #2 stock with a VGM Score of B. The stock has gained 27.1% year to date, outperforming the 14.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX  -  Free Report): Vertex is a key player in the cystic fibrosis (CF) market. The company holds a strong position in this market with two marketed products – Orkambi and Kalydeco. Vertex is working on expanding its CF portfolio and is currently seeking both FDA and EMA approval for a tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination. With the FDA granting priority review, a response should be out by Feb 28, 2018.Vertex, a Zacks Rank #1 stock, has gained 110.5% year to date, substantially outperforming the 14.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (LGND  -  Free Report): Ligand’s business model is based on developing or acquiring royalty revenue generating assets and coupling them with a lean corporate cost structure. The company is focused on the development and licensing of biopharmaceutical assets. Ligand’s Captisol formulation technology has allowed it to enter into several licensing deals and generate royalties. The company’s partners include big names like Amgen and Novartis among others. Ligand also has licensing deals based on its OmniAb technology.Ligand’s recent decision to acquire Crystal Bioscience, a leader in avian genetics and the generation of fully-human therapeutic antibodies, is expected to boost the company’s 2018 revenues by at least $5 million and earnings by at least 9 cents per share.Ligand, a Zacks Rank #1 stock, has gained 39.4% year to date, substantially outperforming the 14.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2184,PFE,"Total earnings for 95.3% of the total healthcare market capitalization are up 7.6% on revenue growth of 4.6%. Though earnings growth appears solid compared with many other sectors, earnings and revenue beat ratios of 72.5% and 58.8%, respectively, look disappointing.Among the most notable players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) was the first major drug company to report earnings on Oct 17, followed by Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) on Oct 24 and Oct 26, respectively. Two other major U.S. drug companies, Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), reported on Oct 27 and Oct 31, respectively. These industry primes posted solid results with either earnings or revenue beats or both.Johnson and Johnson Earnings in FocusThe world's biggest maker of healthcare products continued its long streak of earnings beat. Earnings per share came in at $1.90, 10 cents ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and 13.1% higher than the year-ago quarter. Revenues grew 10.3% year over year to $19.65 billion and edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19.28 billion. Johnson & Johnson raised its full-year earnings per share guidance to $7.25-$7.30 from $7.12-$7.22 and revenue guidance to $76.1-$76.5 billion from $75.8-$76.1 billion (read: Healthcare ETFs in Focus on Johnson & Johnson Q3 Earnings).Pfizer Earnings in FocusThe U.S. drug giant came up with an earnings beat and in-line revenues. Earnings per share of 67 cents came in a couple of cents above the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues of $13.7 billion were in line with the estimate of $13.17 billion. On a year-over-year basis, earnings per share and revenues rose 10% and 1%, respectively. For 2017, Pfizer narrowed the revenue guidance range to $52.4-$53.1 billion from $52-$54 billion while raised the earnings per share guidance range to $2.58-$2.62 from $2.54-$2.60.Merck Earnings in FocusMerck beat the earnings estimate while missed on revenues. Earnings per share came in at $1.11, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.03 and improving 3.7% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues declined 2% year over year to $10.33 billion and were below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.51 billion. Merck raised its revenue guidance to $40-$40.5 billion from $39.4-$40.4 billion and earnings per share guidance to $3.91-$3.97 from $3.76-$3.88 for this year.Bristol-Myers Earnings in FocusBristol-Myers missed on earnings while beats on revenues. It reported earnings per share of 75 cents, a couple of cents below the estimate. Revenues grew 7.1% to $5.25 billion and edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.19 billion. The company raised its earnings per share guidance to $2.95-$3.05 from $2.90-$3.00 (see: all the Healthcare ETFs here).Eli Lilly Earnings in FocusEli Lilly topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both fronts. Earnings of $1.05 outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by couple of cents and came in 19% higher than the year-ago quarter. Revenues grew 9% to $5.66 billion and beat the $5.52-billion estimate. Like other drug makers, Eli Lilly also raised its 2017 revenue and earnings guidance. It now expects revenues in the range of $22.4-$22.7 billion compared with the previous expectation of $22.0-$22.5 billion and earnings per share in the range of $4.15-$4.25 versus $4.10-$4.20 expected previously.ETF AngleThe string of earnings beat failed to boost pharma ETFs as they saw rough trading over the past one month.

2185,PFE,"AstraZeneca AZN) announced that the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) for Tagrisso (osimertinib) for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Tagrisso is currently approved in the United States, European Union, Japan and China, as second-line treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC who progress following treatment with an EGFR TKI due to the EGFR T790M resistance mutation.AstraZeneca’s shares have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has surged 25.4% compared with the industry’’s gain of 18%.The BTD is based on the phase III FLAURA study evaluating Tagrisso versus standard-of-care EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy in the first-line lung cancer setting. The data showed that treatment with Tagrisso reduced the risk of progression or death by more than half compared with other commonly-used EGFR inhibitors for the first-line treatment of patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 18.9 months for patients on Tagrisso as compared with 10.2 months in the comparator arm. Tagrisso was well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with previous experience.BTD from the FDA will expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat serious diseases and should provide access of the drug to patients as soon as possible.In a separate release the company also announced that European Medicines Agency (EMA) has accepted a Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for Imfinzi (durvalumab) for the treatment of patients with locally-advanced (Stage III), unresectable NSCLC whose disease has not progressed following platinum-based chemoradiation therapy. The MAA submission was based on encouraging data from phase III PACIFIC study .Imfinzi has already received accelerated approval in the United States for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or whose disease has progressed within 12 months of receiving platinum-containing chemotherapy before (neoadjuvant) or after (adjuvant) surgery.A potential label expansion of the drugs will boost the sales of the company.In June 2017, another pharmaceutical giant, Roche Holdings (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced that the global, randomized phase III study, ALEX, on lung cancer drug Alecensa met its primary endpoint as an initial (first-line) treatment. Alecensa significantly reduced the risk of disease worsening or death (progression-free survival, PFS) compared with Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xalkori in patients suffering from anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Astrazeneca PLC Price  Astrazeneca PLC Price | Astrazeneca PLC QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAstraZeneca carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2187,PFE,"Johnson &Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), a healthcare bellwether, announced that the FDA has approved a label expansion for its oral pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) medicine, Tracleer.Consequently, a 32 mg tablet of Tracleer is now approved for use in pediatric patients aged three years and older with idiopathic or congenital PAH to improve pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), which is expected to result in an improvement in exercise ability. With the approval, Tracleer has become the first medicine in the U.S. to be approved for use in pediatric patients. The 32 mg oral suspension formulation for pediatric use is expected to be available in the fourth quarter of this year. Presently, Tracleer is marketed in 62.5 and 125 mg dosages for adult patients. These will still be available.We remind investors that Tracleer and other PAH drugs including Opsumit, Ventavis, Veletri and Uptravi were added to J&J’s portfolio with the acquisition of Swiss biotech, Actelion. J&J acquired Actelion in June this year for $30 billion, which diversified the former’s revenues in the PAH category.Actelion’s newer drugs – Opsumit and Uptravi – have been well received and are poised to become blockbuster drugs. However, Tracleer, an older medicine is facing competitive pressure. We believe the label expansion for pediatric use should improve sales of Tracleer, going forward.PAH is a chronic life-threatening disease characterized by increased blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. The PAH market is highly attractive given the low diagnosis rate, low penetration of existing therapies and significant unmet medical need.Other than Actelion, United Therapeutics Corporation (UTHR  -  Free Report) holds a strong position in the PAH market with as many as four approved products - Remodulin, Adcirca, Tyvaso and Orenitram. Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Revatio is used for the same indication as well. Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ARNA  -  Free Report) has ralinepag in its pipeline, which is also being developed for PAH.So far this year, J&J’s share price has increased 13.4%, comparing favorably with a gain of 11.8% recorded by the industry it belongs to.J&J carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2188,PFE,"Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AERI  -  Free Report) posted third-quarter 2017 loss of 71 cents per share (including stock-based compensation), wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 62 cents and the year-ago loss of 67 cents.Being a development-stage company, Aerie has not generated any revenues from product sales yet.  Aerie’s share price has increased 59.2% in the last six months as against the industry’s 2.7% decline. Last month, Aerie’s stock price has surged on positive news for its lead drug, Rhopressa.Quarter in DetailIn the reported quarter, research and development expenses declined 2.2% to $12.4 million. General and administrative expenses surged 86.1% to $19.7 million. Higher operating expenses in the quarter were attributed to expansion of the employee base to support operations and commercialization preparatory activities, including commercial manufacturing costs for Rhopressa.Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and Consensus  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and Consensus | Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Quote Pipeline UpdatesAerie resubmitted a new drug application (NDA) for lead candidate Rhopressa 0.02% in Feb 2017 and expects a review period of 12 months after withdrawing the NDA filed in September 2016 as a third party manufacturing facility in Tampa, FL was not ready for pre-approval inspection by the FDA. The company initiated preparations to bring a second contract manufacturer online in 2018.On Oct 13, the Dermatologic and Ophthalmic Drugs Advisory Committee of the FDA voted in favor of Rhopressa’s approval. The members of the committee unanimously agreed that the trials support the efficacy of netarsudil ophthalmic solution for reducing elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.In addition, majority of the members agreed that the Rhopressa’s efficacy outweigh safety risks.The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act date of Feb 28, 2018. We note that the FDA is not bound by the Advisory Committee’s guidance but takes its advice into consideration when reviewing drugs.Apart from Rhopressa, Aerie is evaluating Roclatan, a once-daily, quadruple-action fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa and Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xalatan. The NDA for Roclatan is expected to be filed in second-quarter 2018.  The company also initiated Mercury 3 to support filings in Europe. The trial will be a non-inferiority trial comparing Roclatan to prescribed fixed dose combination of Ganfort (a combination of the bimatoprost along with timolol), marketed by Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) in Europe.Our TakeThe narrower-than-expected loss in the third quarter was encouraging. We are encouraged by the company's efforts in developing its pipeline candidates. A potential approval of Rhopressa in early 2018 will significantly boost growth prospects.Zacks Rank & Key Pick                                                   Aerie currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the health care sector worth considering is Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report),carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2189,PFE,"The pharmaceutical sector has been grabbing investors’ attention of late with the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index gaining 13.1% and the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry 20.7% year to date, outpacing 14.7% gain for the S&P 500. New drug approvals and tax reforms are expected to provide a further impetus to the stocks. However, factors like drug pricing and competition from biosimilars will continue to act as major deterrents. On the other hand, companies like Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) are resorting to workforce reduction for a leaner cost structure. On the M&A front, apart from Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) acquisition of Actelion Ltd in June, nothing much has happened in this space. Merck & Co (MRK  -  Free Report) recently announced that it will acquire Germany-based Rigontec, a privately held immuno-oncology focused biotech to boost its immune-oncology pipeline. Nevertheless, the proposed tax reforms are expected to boost cash balances of the companies which in turn can be used for mergers/acquisitions.Here we have picked four of the largest drug companies which look well poised for growth and can be a prudent choice for adding to one’s portfolio:Based in Switzerland, Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) is one of the leaders in health care solutions with a wide array of drugs and services. Novartis has a presence in the field of oncology, neuroscience, ophthalmology and generics. Novartis has a strong oncology portfolio of drugs like Afinitor, Exjade, Jakavi, Zykadia, Tasigna, Jadenu and an improved formulation of Exjade.The recent FDA approval of Kisqali for advanced or metastatic breast cancer and breakthrough gene transfer treatment, Kymriah suspension for acute lymphoblastic leukemia has further boosted the portfolio. The approval is a major boost for Novartis given the potential in the CAR T therapy space.Growth drivers like Cosentyx and Entresto more than offset the impact of generic erosion, mainly due to Glivec. Cosentyx achieved blockbuster status in 2016. We believe that the approval of new drugs and label expansion of existing ones should boost the top line going forward. Novartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Novartis’ stock has gained 21.8% year to date. Strength in oncology drugs and the approval of the first CAR T therapy should continue to boost performance. Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report), one of the leading pharmaceutical companies in the United States, focuses on the development and commercialization of a wide range of products including human and animal biologic as well as small molecule medicines and vaccines, along with consumer health care products. Pfizer is looking to drive growth through licensing deals and collaborative agreements.The company is looking to expand the labels of approved drugs like Ibrance, Xeljanz, Xalkori and Eliquis. Pfizer also boasts a strong pipeline. Moreover, Pfizer is evaluating various biosimilar molecules in several stages of development given the potential in the market. Shares of the company have moved up 9.3%, in the last three months comparing favorably with the industry’s gain. Pfizer presently carries a Zacks Rank #2. Earnings estimates of the company for 2017 have been static over the past 60 days. Bagsværd, Denmark-based Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO  -  Free Report) is a global leader in the diabetes market. The company is also a key player in hemophilia care, growth hormone therapy, hormone replacement therapy and obesity. The company’s portfolio includes drugs like Levemir, NovoRapid, Victoza, NovoMix 30, NovoMix 50, NovoMix 70, NovoSeven, NovoThirteen and Norditropin.Additionally, obesity drug, Saxenda (liraglutide 3 mg) was launched in the United States in 2015 and its uptake has been encouraging. Victoza is currently the market leader in the GLP-1 segment and we expect Victoza to continue being a significant contributor to the company’s top line. In August, the FDA approved a new indication for Victoza to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular (CV) events in adults with type II diabetes and established CV disease.We believe the label expansion of drugs will further boost the top line. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. The company’s shares have rallied 40.5% year to date. The company’s earnings estimates for 2017 have moved up 3% over the last 60 days. Headquartered in Leverkusen, Germany, Bayer AG (BAYRY  -  Free Report) is a life science company with core competencies in the areas of health care and agriculture.  Bayer has been consistently making efforts to transform into a pure life science company. Drugs launched over the last few quarters are expected to continue to drive the top line.  Bayer is looking for a label expansion of its oncology drug Stivarga, which is approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer and metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors.The company has inked several strategic deals and undertook meaningful acquisitions in the recent past. Bayer is looking to acquire Monsanto in an all-cash transaction and the combined business is expected to boost Bayer’s Crop Science business and provide accretion to its bottom-line.Bayer currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company’s shares have gained 35.1% year to date. Earnings estimates for 2017 of the company have moved north 3.2% over the last 60 days. Bottom Line  Challenges in the form of pricing pressure and competition will remain in the healthcare sector. Nevertheless, picking some outperformers from the space, backed by a solid Zacks Rank and positive price movement could lead investors to gain this earnings season.4 Stocks to Watch After the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

The lawsuit, filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleges infringement of 18 patents. Although Sanofi’s diabetes product sales are under immense pressure, the Lantus franchise remains a major contributor to the top-line. Earlier this year in August, Sanofi had filed a patent infringement suit against Merck alleging infringement of two patents related to Lantus products.Interest Increases in Pfizer’s Consumer Healthcare Business: Ever since Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that it is exploring strategic options for its Consumer Healthcare business, including a full or partial separation via a spin off or sale, quite a few companies have been rumored to be interested in striking a deal. This week, British pharma major, Glaxo, was asked on its third quarter call about its interest in acquiring Pfizer’s Consumer Healthcare business.  Glaxo’s own Consumer segment has been witnessing a material slowdown in global growth across key categories with factors like pricing pressure, increasing competition and tougher emerging markets weighing on performance (Read more: Glaxo Q3 Earnings Beat, Revenues In Line, Shares Down).Meanwhile, according to a Reuters article, Pfizer expects to start the auction process for its consumer healthcare business in November. According to sources, possible bidders apart from Glaxo and Reckitt Benckiser could include names like Procter & Gamble, Sanofi, Johnson & Johnson and Nestle.PerformanceThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index declined 3.7% this week. Among major stocks, Glaxo declined 10.9% mainly reflecting concerns about the company’s dividend payouts especially if it strikes a deal for Pfizer’s Consumer Healthcare business.

2191,PFE,"GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) reported core earnings of 85 cents per American depositary share in the third quarter of 2017, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 84 cents. The bottom line was, however, flat at constant exchange rates (CER).Glaxo’s shares dropped more than 2% in after-hours trading. At the third-quarter conference call, Glaxo showed an interest to purchase Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) consumer healthcare business, which the latter plans to put up on sales. However, Glaxo’s interest in buying Pfizer’s unit raised investor’s concerns about the acquirer possibly sacrificing a portion of its dividend payment due to the potential buyout. So far this year, the stock has lost 3.2% against the industry’s 17.8% increase. Quarterly revenues were up 2% at CER to $10.2 billion (£7.8 billion) on the back of strong performances mainly in the Pharmaceuticals segments. However, revenues were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.All growth rates mentioned below are on a year-over-year basis and at CER.Quarterly HighlightsSales were up 4% in the United States and 1% in International markets. On the other hand, sales in Europe registered a decrease of 2%.Sales of New Pharmaceutical and Vaccine products surged 40%, driven by HIV drugs, Tivicay and Triumeq; respiratory drugs, the Ellipta products and Nucala; and vaccines to prevent meningitis, Bexsero and Menveo.Glaxo reports results under three segments: Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare.The Pharmaceuticals division registered revenue growth of 2%, driven by HIV drugs, Tivicay and Triumeq, and respiratory disease drugs, Relvar/Breo and Nucala. This upside was partly offset by the impact of recent divestments.HIV sales rallied 13% on the back of 18% growth in the United States and 24% in International sales. Europe sales were however, down 1% year over year. Otherwise, the encouraging numbers came on the back of continued market share growth for both Triumeq (sales up 29%) and Tivicay (sales up 41%). However, sales of another HIV drug Epzicom/Kivexa tumbled 65% due to an increased generic competition, particularly affecting the European market.Respiratory sales were flat at CER. In both United States and Europe, sales dipped 1%. However, in International markets, the same increased 3%. This downside was mainly due to a continued transition to newer products in the portfolio.Sales of new respiratory products like Relvar/Breo Ellipta, Anoro Ellipta, Arnuity Ellipta and Nucala were offset by lower sales of Seretide/Advair sales (down 15%). Flixotide/Flovent and Ventolin sales decreased 22% and 13%, respectively.The Ellipta products recorded a 54% surge in sales, driven by market share gains with the global roll-out continuing.Immuno-inflammation drugs, which include Benlysta, rose 24% in the quarter.The new grouping of Established Pharmaceuticals includes the previous Established Products, Cardiovascular, metabolic and urology (CVMU) and other Pharma products. Established Pharmaceuticals sales declined 4% in the quarter.Sales in the Consumer Healthcare segment went up, despite a slowdown in market conditions. The power brands, particularly in Pain relief and Oral health categories, saw a strong performance in the quarter.Sales from the Vaccines segment were flat at CER. Geographically, the United States and Europe were up 6%, whereas international markets dropped 14%. While meningitis vaccines — Bexsero, in the United States and Europe whereas Menveo in the United States — saw higher sales, the same was offset by a weak performance of the Established Vaccines, driven by increasing competitive pressures on Infanrix, Pediarix in the United States and Europe.Notably, in October, Glaxo announced that the FDA has granted an approval to its vaccine, Shingrix, for the prevention of shingles (herpes zoster). Subsequently, during the same month, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted in favor of three recommendations for the use of Shingrix. The vaccine is preferred over Merck's (MRK  -  Free Report) Zostavax.OutlookThe company expects to face a generic competition for Advair in the United States next year, which will affect the top line. However, there is uncertainty regarding the timing of launch of a generic version of the drug. With no generic version of Advair expected to be unveiled in 2017, the company continues to expect core 2017 earnings growth in the range of 3-5% at CER.We remind investors that Mylan's (MYL  -  Free Report) efforts to bring a generic version of Advair in the market suffered a blow as the FDA issued a complete response letter to its abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) for Advair in April, thereby delaying the entry of the generic. Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC’s generic version of Advair was also denied an approval by the FDA in May. The drug’s generic version is therefore not likely to be approved this year.GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | GlaxoSmithKline PLC QuoteZacks RankGlaxo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2192,PFE,"It’s been a relatively good year for pharmaceutical stocks, given that they have caught the eye of investors for the greater part of 2017. Despite occasional comments on drug pricing, this time around from President Trump, pharma companies have been largely spared close scrutiny on this front. Such a scheme of things is a far cry from Hillary Clinton’s comments on this issue in the run up to the last Presidential elections.Additionally, Trump’s commitment toward deregulation has gladdened sector leaders. Meanwhile, there are some other factors that should continue to have a positive impact on pharma and biotech stocks. These are new product sales ramp up, R&D success and innovation, strong results, a higher number of FDA approvals and continued strong performance from legacy products. (Read: 5 Pharma & Biotech Stocks That Could Be Big Winners in Q3 Earnings)Signs of the sector’s success are more than evident. The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index and the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index have gained 13.7% and 21.1%, respectively, year to date.With Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) scheduled to report on Oct 27 and Oct 31, respectively, this may be a good time to consider which of these is a better stock. Both stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other major earnings scheduled during this period include Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) and Electronic Arts Inc. (EA  -  Free Report). Price PerformanceThe pharma sector’s recovery in fortunes is more than evident from the price performance of the broader industry, which is up 18.7% year to date. Both Pfizer and Merck are underperformers with respect to their broader industry. However, Pfizer is the better performer on this count, since it has gained 11.3% year to date versus Merck’s 6.1% gain.ValuationThe most appropriate ratio to evaluate these two drug makers is perhaps EV/EBITDA. This metric is usually used to compare two stocks within the same industry. It is superior to other metrics such as P/E because it is not affected by the different capital structures of the two companies.Coming to the two pharma majors, both Merck and Pfizer are undervalued relative to their broader industry, which has an EV/EBITDA value of 13.31. However, Pfizer holds the edge here with a lower EV/EBITDA value of 9.6, compared to Merck’s value of 10.4.Dividend YieldBoth Pfizer and Merck have offered a superior dividend yield over the last one year period compared to the broader industry, which has returned 2.9% over this period. However, with a dividend yield of 3.5%, Pfizer is ahead of Merck on this count, but only because Merck has offered a dividend yield of 3% over the same period.Gross MarginThe pharmaceutical industry enjoys higher profit margins than several other sectors. This is possibly one of the reasons why critics of the sector continually draw attention to allegedly exorbitant drug pricing, which likely helps the sector maintain its stiff margins.With a gross margin TTM value of 67.9%, Merck underperforms rival Pfizer on this count. On the other hand, Pfizer sports a gross margin TTM value of 78.2%, which outperforms Merck as well as the broader industry, which has a gross margin TTM value of 72.5%.Earnings History, ESP and Estimate RevisionsConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history, Merck has delivered positive surprises in all the prior four quarters with an average earnings surprise of 8.1%. In comparison, Pfizer delivered an earnings beat in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of -0.4%.When considering Earnings ESP, Merck is once again the clear winner. With an ESP of -0.11%, Pfizer is at a disadvantage, since Merck holds a value of +0.12%. Additionally, Merck’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased by 0.2% over the last 30 days, while Pfizer’s has remained unchanged.ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that Pfizer holds an edge over Merck when considering price performance, EV/EBITDA ratios and gross margins. It also sports a marginally superior dividend yield. However, when considering estimate revisions and a more comprehensive look at its previous earnings performance, Merck is clearly the better stock.What clinches the case in favor of Merck at this point in time is that it sports a superior ESP value of +0.12% compared with Pfizer’s dismal reading of -0.11%. This is why it may be better to bet on Merck over Pfizer as they prepare to report earnings over the next few days.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

On Feb 28, the company resubmitted its NDA for Rhopressa  and expects a standard review period of 12 months. The company also expects to start a clinical study for Rhopressa later in 2017 to address the Japanese market.Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

2194,PFE,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda has received approval from the European Commission (EC) for the first and second line treatment of certain patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, a type of bladder cancer.Keytruda has been approved as a first-line therapy for patients who cannot receive standard of care chemotherapy containing cisplatin. Keytruda was also approved as a second-line treatment for patients who have been previously treated with platinum-containing chemotherapyThe approval was expected in July as the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) had granted a positive opinion, recommending approval of Keytruda.In the United States, Keytruda received accelerated approval for advanced bladder cancer indication in May this year.The approvals were based on data from the phase II KEYNOTE-052 trial and the phase III KEYNOTE-045 trial. Data from these studies have shown a clinically meaningful and improved overall survival benefit of Keytruda versus chemotherapy in this difficult-to-treat population.Keytruda is presently approved for many types of cancers and treatment settings including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical hodgkin lymphoma and bladder cancer.Keytruda brought in sales of $881 million in second-quarter 2017, up 51% sequentially and 180% year over year. Sales continue to be driven by launch of new indications globally. Keytruda sales in the U.S. gained particularly from strong momentum in the new indication of first-line lung cancer. Outside U.S, Keytruda sales were primarily driven by the melanoma indication.Meanwhile, the Keytruda development program also significantly advanced in the first half with regulatory approvals for four new indications in the U.S. and an additional indication in Europe. Important approvals include that for advanced bladder cancer, advanced microsatellite instability-high cancers and first approval as a combination therapy with Eli Lilly & Company’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drug Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo),), a commonly used chemo regimen, in lung cancer. Further Keytruda data readouts are pending in the second half.Keytruda is continuously growing and expanding into new indications and markets globally. Keytruda is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer in more than 550 studies, including more than 300 combination studies. Merck is collaborating with several companies including Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report), Incyte, Glaxo and Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) separately for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens.Merck’s shares have risen 8% this year so far against a 12% increase for the industry.Merck carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2195,PFE,"Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved its Botox Cosmetic product for a third indication — temporary improvement of moderate to severe forehead lines in appearance, associated with frontalis muscle activity in adults.So far this year, Allergan’s share price has slipped 0.1% compared with the industry’s decline of 19.8%.Approved for therapeutic and aesthetic use, Botox is a key top-line driver for Allergan. Its cosmetic indications include improvement in appearance of glabellar lines (frown lines between the brows) and severe crow’s feet. This latest FDA approval makes Botox Cosmetic the only neurotoxin treatment approved for three facial aesthetic treatments — forehead lines, crow’s feet wrinkles at the outer corner of eyes and glabellar lines.Botox’s therapeutic diseases include overactive bladder, cervical dystonia, chronic migraine and strabismus among others.The drug generated $1.53 billion sales in the first half of 2017, an increase of 12.7% year over year, driven by strong demand trends. The latest label expansion approval for forehead line treatment, which enjoys a pent-up demand, should drive the sales further.We remind investors that Botox became a part of Allergan’s portfolio following the March 2015 $77 billion acquisition of Allergan Inc. Having previously commanded a strong presence in the generics market, Allergan with the merger has found place on the top 10 list of world-wide pharma companies based on sales. Later, Allergan sold its generics business as well as the Anda distribution arm to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA  -  Free Report) in 2016. However, in April 2016, Pfizer, Inc.

2196,PFE,"MEI Pharma, Inc. (MEIP  -  Free Report) announced that it has inked an exclusive license agreement with Presage Biosciences, an oncology company, for developing its oral and selective cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, voruciclib (formerly P1446A), for treatment of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2).Pursuant to the agreement, MEI Pharma wins exclusive rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize voruciclib globally. On the other hand, Presage will be entitled to receive near-term payments of $2.9 million along with $181 million upon achieving certain development, plus regulatory and commercial milestones. Also, on successful development of any product, Presage will be entitled to receive mid single-digit tiered royalties on the net sales.MEI Pharma’s shares have increased more than 5% following the news. Also, shares of the company have significantly outperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has surged 95.8% versus the industry’s 2.2% increase during the period.MEI Pharma also informed that the agreement provides an efficient development path in combination with Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) BCL2 inhibitor, Venclexta (venetoclax). The company also believes that the deal will enable both the parties to utilize MEI Pharma’s CIVO intratumoral microdosing platform for advancing additional candidates and combinations to treat various types of cancers.We remind investors that voruciclib boasts an established clinical safety profile. The candidate has been evaluated in many phase I studies with more than 70 patients. Additionally, in pre-clinical studies, voruciclib alone demonstrated cell death in multiple patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).Notably, presently Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Ibrance (palbociclib) and Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Kisqali (ribociclib) are two CDK inhibitors approved in the United States for treating HER2 negative breast cancer combined with hormonal therapy. Hence, voruciclib is expected to confront competition on approval, given presence of established products in the targeted space.However, the agreement will expand MEI Pharma’s oncology portfolio and offer additional opportunities to improve the lives of patients suffering from cancer.MEI Pharma, Inc.

2197,PFE,"Pharmaceutical stocks were in the limelight this week with Merck's (MRK  -  Free Report) CEO Ken Frazier resigning from President Donald Trump’s manufacturing council. The sector was also in the news with an investigation being launched into the rising prices of multiple sclerosis (""MS"") drugs.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesBayer, Novartis, Teva & Others Face MS Drug Price Probe: Drug pricing is back in the news with an investigation into the skyrocketing prices of MS drugs being launched by Rep. Elijah E. Cummings and Rep. Peter Welch. Letters have been sent to seven companies including Biogen, Teva, Roche, Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), Merck KGaA, Bayer and Sanofi requesting information about their pricing strategies for their MS drugs. The letters have also raised the issue of “shadow pricing” – when an expensive new drug is launched or the price of an existing drug is raised, other companies follow suit and increase prices to match the higher prices.  According to an American Academy of Neurology study, annual sales of MS drugs doubled from $4 billion to almost $9 billion from 2008 to 2012.  Meanwhile, information provided by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society shows that the average wholesale price of MS disease modifying therapies was $16,000 in 2004 and shot up to $61,000 in 2013 and $83,688 in 2017. Mylan to pay $465M under DoJ Settlement: Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) announced that an agreement has been signed with the U.S. Department of Justice (""DOJ"") and two relators regarding the Medicaid drug rebate settlement for $465 million. With this move, all claims relating to the classification of Mylan’s EpiPen Auto-Injector and EpiPen Jr Auto-Injector for purposes of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program have been resolved. EpiPen, which was listed as a non-innovator drug, will be reclassified. Mylan said that it also entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (Also read: Why Did Mylan Stock Surge Today?).Broader Label for AstraZeneca/Merck’s PARP Inhibitor: The FDA expanded the label of AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) and Merck’s PARP inhibitor Lynparza for ovarian cancer. A new tablet formulation was also approved as maintenance treatment for women with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer regardless of BRCA-mutation status as well as for use beyond the third line setting in BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer. The approval of the tablet formulation will provide patients with a convenient dosing option as they can take 2 tablets twice daily instead of 8 capsules twice daily.

According to information provided by Pfizer, the 5-year overall survival rate for patients with relapsed or refractory adult ALL is less than 10%. Besponsa’s approval path in the U.S. included a Breakthrough Therapy designation and priority review. Although the label comes with a black box warning for hepatotoxicity, this should not impact uptake given the poor survival rate for this patient population. EU approval for Besponsa came earlier this year in June.Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo Combination Disappoints in Kidney Cancer Study:  Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo failed to meet one of the co-primary endpoints in a late stage study evaluating the PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor plus Yervoy versus Sutent (sunitinib) in intermediate and poor-risk patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic renal cell cancer. The Opdivo-Yervoy combination met the objective response rate co-primary endpoint (41.6% versus 26.5%) but failed to show statistical significance for progression-free survival. The third co-primary endpoint of overall survival is yet to mature. Opdivo is approved for second-line renal cell carcinoma and positive data from this study would have helped support label expansion into the first-line setting. With the study ongoing for overall survival data, hitting this co-primary endpoint could support label expansion (Also read: Bristol-Myers Opdivo Fails Kidney Cancer Trial CheckMate-214).

2198,PFE,"Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report) announced that it has completed the submission of a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the FDA for Cabometyx tablets for patients with previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).The sNDA submission was based on positive results from phase II trial, CABOSUN, in patients with previously untreated advanced RCC with intermediate- or poor-risk disease per the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC).An independent radiology review committee has confirmed the primary efficacy endpoint results of investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) in the CABOSUN trial. The study compared Cabometyx to Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Sutent in the first-line treatment of intermediate- or poor-risk advanced RCC patients. As per the analysis from the committee, Cabometyx demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction in the rate of disease progression or death as measured by PFS.In May 2016, Exelixis announced that CABOSUN met its primary endpoint as Cabometyx demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS compared to Sutent in patients with advanced intermediate- or poor-risk RCC as determined by investigator assessment.We remind investors that Cabometyx was approved by the FDA in Apr 2016 for the treatment of patients with advanced RCC who received prior anti-angiogenic therapy. A potential label expansion of the drug will further boost results.New patient starts, refills for patients already on therapy and continued expansion of the prescriber base for Cabometyx are driving the drug’s sales. The sequential increase in Cabometyx sales was driven by growth in prescriptions.Exelixis has collaborated with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY  -  Free Report) and Roche Holdings (RHHBY  -  Free Report) for the development of the drug in combination with immunotherapy agents.Exelixis’ share price has increased 79.6% year to date compared with the industry’s gain of 7.4%.Earlier in the week, Bristol-Myers announced disappointing top-line results from the CheckMate-214 trial which investigated immuno-oncology drug Opdivo in combination with Yervoy versus Sutent in intermediate and poor-risk patients previously untreated advanced or metastatic RCC. The trial did not meet its primary endpoint.We note that renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults and accounts for more than 100,000 deaths worldwide each year. Among these, clear-cell RCC is the most prevalent type of RCC and constitutes 80-90% of all cases thereby underlying the demand for the same.Hence a potential approval of Cabometyx for previously untreated advanced or metastatic RCC will boost sales.Zacks RankExelixis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2199,PFE,"U.S. equity markets are going through turbulent times. There is a lot of volatility and uncertainty owing to rising geopolitical risks and political uncertainty. This has increased the appeal of dividend investing.Geopolitical RisksGeopolitical risks have been on the rise. North Korea conducted its seventh nuclear test, an Inter Continental Ballistic Missile that flew over Japan, on Sep 14, 2017. Kim Jong-Un’s actions have created huge unrest in a number of Asian economies and the United States.In response to continuous missile tests, President Donald Trump in his maiden UN General Assembly speech threatened to completely destroy North Korea. This prompted North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un to warn the United States of the ""highest level of hard-line countermeasure in history”.Moreover, North Korea’s foreign minister stated that Trump’s comments indicate that the United States has declared war against North Korea. ""Since the U.S. declared war on our country, we will have every right to make countermeasures, including the right to shoot down the U.S. bombers even when they are not yet inside the airspace border of our country,"" foreign minister Ri Yong Ho said. However, the White House has rejected the accusations.This latest development made investors flock to safe haven investments and led to a decline in tech stocks (read: Safe Haven Currency ETFs Gain Amid Latest North Korea Threats).Trump’s ActionsThere is increased uncertainty with regard to Trump’s ability to pass the promised legislations relating to tax reform and deregulation. Although economic fundamentals have been strong, there are renewed doubts over the capabilities of the Trump administration.Trump introduced a new travel ban with restrictions on citizens from eight nations, six of which are Muslim majority. Starting Oct 18, citizens of Chad, Iran, Libya, Syria, Venezuela, Yemen, Somalia, and North Korea will be banned from traveling to the United States. However, people holding permanent residency or visas are exempted from the ban, but cannot renew their visas once they expire.Moreover, the Trump administration is being highly criticized. In a separate development, six advisers to Trump have been found to be using personal email addresses for official government purposes. This is ironical given Trump’s stance on the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal server prior to the 2016 Presidential elections (read: Trump Widens North Korea Sanctions: ETFs in Focus).In such a scenario, dividend-paying securities provide consistent income to investors. The uniqueness of these securities is their increase when political uncertainty weighs on markets, more so because apart from high dividend, these securities exhibit less volatility as they are stable and mature companies.Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to U.S. equities with relatively high dividend yields.FlexShares Quality Dividend Index Fund (QDF  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to U.S. companies providing high dividends while maintaining a quality factor and utilizing constraints to minimize risk.It has AUM of $1.8 billion and charges a fee of 37 basis points a year.

2200,PFE,"We expect Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 31, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.08%.The pharma giant has a mixed record of earnings surprises. The company’s earnings surpassed expectations in two of the last four quarters while missing in the other two, resulting in an average negative surprise of 0.39%.Pfizer’s shares have risen 11.7% this year so far, comparing unfavorably with an increase of 20.3% for the Zacks classified industry. Factors at PlayNew products like Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis) and Ibrance (breast cancer) as well as older products like Lyrica (neuropathic pain) and Eliquis (blood thinner) may contribute to the top line meaningfully.However, loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for products like Pristiq Vfend, Zyvox and Celebrex and the expiration of a few co-promotion agreements will continue to hamper top-line growth.Sales of blockbuster drug Enbrel will continue to decline in the quarter due to biosimilar competition. The lower sales trend in Prevnar/Prevenar 13 vaccines franchise is likely to continue. Sales of Viagra are also likely to be affected by lower demand. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Prevnar and Enbrel is $1.47 billion and $565 million, respectively.At the Q2 call, management said that the penetration of Inflectra, Pfizer’s biosimilar version of J&J’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade, in the United States has been slower than expected as it is experiencing access challenges among national commercial payers.In fact, in September, Pfizer filed a lawsuit in a U.S. district court alleging that J&J wasresorting to unfair practices to prevent sale of Inflectra. Though J&J did not discuss much about Inflectra’s impact on the branded drug’s sales or the lawsuit at its Q3 call, we expect an update from Pfizer at its upcoming investor call.Meanwhile, the bottom line is likely to be driven by cost savings and share buybacks. However, new product launch expenses and R&D investments are expected to hurt profits.Pfizer’s acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) candidate, Bavencio/avelumab received FDA approval for metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in March 2017 and for advanced bladder cancer in May. Bavencio was also approved in EU and Japan in September for MCCTwo leukemia treatments - Besponsa/inotuzumab ozogamicin for relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Mylotarg for newly diagnosed CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were also approved by the FDA in the third quarter of 2017.Besponsa was also approved in the EU in June.We expect management to record sales from these new cancer drugs this quarter.Earlier this month, Pfizer said that it is exploring strategic alternatives for its Consumer Healthcare segment including a partial or a full separation through a spin-off, sale or other transaction. An update on the matter is expected at the investor call.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model shows that Pfizer is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate (65 cents per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (64 cents per share), is +0.94%. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Pfizer has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Pfizer’s Zacks Rank #3 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Pfizer, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Pfizer, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Pfizer, Inc. QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderA couple of stocks in the pharmaceuticals sector that also have a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are:Merck & Co., Inc.

2202,PFE,"Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the U.S. preceded only by heart disease.The traditional cancer treatments include surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. However, immunotherapy, gene therapy and other new novel therapies are being developed to improve, supplement or replace traditional cancer treatments with the target to reduce or remove cancerous growths.According to a report by the American Cancer Society, almost 1.7 million new cancer cases are expected to be diagnosed in 2017, which creates significant need for effective cancer medication. It goes without saying that all big pharma companies are gearing up to develop and bring innovative cancer treatments to market as well as expand the labels of their marketed oncology drugs. These pharma/biotech giants have significant financial resources at their disposal and have even collaborated to pool their resources and technology.Here we discuss four pharma giants, which possess the industry’s strongest oncology pipeline portfolios.AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report)AstraZeneca is working on strengthening its oncology product portfolio and has several candidates in its pipeline. The company’s target is to launch at least six new oncology medicines between 2014 and 2020, including Lynparza, Tagrisso and Imfinzi, which are already approved and marketed.An interesting candidate in the company’s immuno-oncology pipeline is Imfinzi (durvalumab) being evaluated for multiple cancers (either alone or in combination with other regimens), including phase III trials in combination with tremelimumab in first-line urothelial cancer, NSCLC, small cell lung cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) among others. Imfinzi was launched in the U.S. for the first indication – second line advanced bladder cancer - in May 2017.Other phase III oncology candidates in AstraZeneca’s pipeline include acalabrutinib (blood cancers.), moxetumomab pasudotox (leukaemia), selumetinib (thyroid cancer) and savolitinib (kidney cancer).Lynparza, presently marketed for advanced ovarian cancer, is also in different studies for a range of tumor types including breast, prostate and pancreatic cancers as well as earlier-line settings for ovarian cancer. Tagrisso is also being evaluated in earlier-line settings for lung cancer.AstraZeneca carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.So far this year, AstraZeneca’s shares have moved up 10%, comparing unfavorably to a 12.3% increase for the large-cap pharma industry.Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report)Pfizer’s newly approved immunotherapy, Bavencio, is being considered a significant top-line driver for this New York-based pharma giant.Bavencio/avelumab received FDA approval for metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in March 2017 and for advanced bladder cancer in May. Bavencio is under review in the EU for MCC with a decision expected in the third quarter of 2017. Pfizer is focusing on continuously growing and expanding Bavencio into new indications and markets globally.Pfizer has also initiated avelumab double/triple combination studies for chemotherapy and targeted therapies and has 11 avelumab combination therapies with immuno-oncology agents under development.Pfizer’s two other oncology candidates have also been approved by the FDA recently – Besponsa - for relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia in August and Mylotarg for new or relapsed CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia in September. Other cancer candidates in Pfizer’s pipeline include talazoparib (advanced breast cancer) and dacomitinib (advanced NSCLC with EGFR activating mutations).Pfizer is also aggressively working on expanding the labels of approved cancer drugs like Ibrance and Xalkori.Pfizer also carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). So far this year, Pfizer’s shares have moved up 4.1%.AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report)AbbVie is working on expanding and accelerating its presence in oncology and building upon its growing position in hematological oncologyAbbVie’s Imbruvica, currently approved for several cancer indications, has multi-billion dollar potential and AbbVie is exploring the potential to expand Imbruvica’s label into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases. AbbVie is positioning Imbruvica as a “pipeline in a molecule” - the treatment is in several company-sponsored studies.With the 2016 acquisition of cancer drugmaker, Stemcentrx AbbVie gained a late-stage candidate, rovalpituzumab tesirine or Rova-T, four additional early-stage compounds in solid tumor indications and a significant portfolio of pre-clinical assets. Rova-T is currently in registrational studies for small cell lung cancer (SCLC). A phase I, eight-arm ""basket study"" on Rova-T in neuroendocrine tumors is also ongoing. According to AbbVie, the candidate has blockbuster potential and could be launched in 2018. AbbVie intends to study the candidate for additional indications and estimates peak sales close to $5 billion.AbbVie is also studying marketed cancer drug Venclyxto/Venclexta to expand the label to address the broader relapsed/refractory CLL patient population, expand into earlier lines of therapy, and broaden into other hematologic malignancies.AbbVie also carries a Zacks Rank #3. So far this year, AbbVie’s shares have moved up 20.2%.Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report)Bristol-Myers PD-1 inhibitor, Opdivo, has been performing impressively while Bristol-Myers is working on expanding the label of Opdivo further, alone or in combination therapies with Yervoy and other anti-cancer agents.Further, Bristol-Myers’ cancer portfolio includes multiple myeloma drug, Empliciti and leukemia drug, Sprycel, contributing to the top line. In addition, Bristol-Myers is evaluating other immune system pathways for the treatment of cancer. These pathways may help the company bring to market potentially transformational immunotherapies – in combination or as monotherapy – to help fight different types of cancers.Bristol-Myers also carries a Zacks Rank #3. So far this year, Bristol-Myers’ shares have moved up 2.3%.Others Not Far BehindMerck (MRK  -  Free Report) is also conducting numerous studies to evaluate its highly successful anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda for more than 30 types of cancer in more than 550 studies, including more than 300 combination studies.Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) dominates the breast cancer space with strong demand for its HER2 franchise drugs like Herceptin, Perjeta and Kadcyla. Apart from its strong breast cancer franchise, Roche’s oncology portfolio also boasts of lung cancer drugs like Avastin and Tarceva, immuno-oncology drugs like Tecentriq and newly approved multiple sclerosis drug Ocrevus. Label expansion efforts are ongoing for all these cancer drugs.Swiss drugmaker Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) also boasts many experimental cancer drugs in its R&D pipeline including a couple of biosimilar versions of popular cancer drugs. Novartis' cancer pipeline was bolstered by the deal to buy most of Glaxo's (GSK  -  Free Report) oncology portfolio in 2014.Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) also laid out its oncology strategy at its Q2 call held in July, which involves building on key treatments like Cyramza, Lartruvo and abemaciclib as foundational agents while focusing on developing new standard-of-care changing therapies and combination regimens, including immuno-therapies.ConclusionCompetition in the cancer market is fierce and not all pipeline candidates will be successful. However, pharma biggies have enough late-stage cancer programs in their portfolios and there are chances of quite a few rollouts in the coming years.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

2203,PFE,"Agilent Technologies (A  -  Free Report) recently received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a cancer diagnostic, named PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx. The test will be used in cases of urothelial carcinoma (“UC”) and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (“SCCHN”).This is a new step in the company's efforts to expand in the growing cancer-diagnostic market.The PDL1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx test has already been approved for melanoma as well as non-squamous, non-small-cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”). Now, it has been approved for UC and SCCHN patients too. The test enables physicians in the United States to identify UC and SCCHN patients, who still have disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy and are most likely to benefit from treatment with Opdivo.Opdivo is an immunotherapy developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS). PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx was developed in collaboration with Opdivo maker, BMS. Currently, this test has a lot more utility than any other PD-L1 assay in the U.S. market.Agilent's Role in HealthcareCurrently, the healthcare sector is witnessing a revolution. Personalized medicine is taking the center stage as it could provide improved patient care and better manage costs by administering the most appropriate treatment to individuals. It has been found that not all treatments are suitable for those suffering from a specific disease as some require more specialized tests.The advancements could have far-reaching effects on the entire healthcare system as personalized medicines considerably improve patient care while reducing medical bills.Agilent has signed several collaborative agreements with pharma and biotech companies including Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report), Bristol-MyersSquibb, Merck & Co. (MRK  -  Free Report), Amgen and Eli Lilly to develop diagnostics using both immunohistochemical and genomic-based technologies for the better treatment of cancer.Bottom LineAgilent is an original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) of a broad-based portfolio of test and measurement products serving multiple end markets. We remain positive on Agilent's broad-based portfolio and increased focus on segments with higher growth potential. Further, the company continues to introduce high-margin products.According to a report from marketsandmarkets.com, the worldwide cancer diagnostics market may reach $13.1 billion by 2020 from $7.1 billion by 2015, driven by several technological advancements in diagnostic platforms. Moreover, the market has seen the advent of hybrid imaging instruments with enhanced accuracy, such as PET/CT and SPECT/CT. These advancements have taken the cancer-diagnostics market to new heights.We believe the new assay will help Agilent to cash in on the fast-growing healthcare cancer-diagnostics segment.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

2204,PFE,"Key highlights in the pharma sector include a complete response letter (“CRL”) from the FDA for Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) investigational rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”) treatment and FDA approval for Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY  -  Free Report) cancer drugs.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesCRL for J&J RA Drug: J&J’s Janssen Biotech got a CRL from the FDA for sirukumab for the treatment of moderately to severely active RA. The agency has asked for additional data on the safety of sirukumab. This does not come as a surprise considering the investigational treatment failed to get the support of an FDA advisory panel last month. Given the safety concerns raised by the panel, the request for additional data was more or less expected. J&J intends to meet with the agency to determine the requirements for gaining approval for the IL-6 inhibitor.Meanwhile, the company has submitted a new drug application (“NDA”) for the first darunavir-based single tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV. Approval would make this combination the only complete regimen with the potential to deliver the advantages of a single table regimen with the high genetic barrier to resistance of darunavir and the demonstrated safety profile of TAF.Another FDA Nod for Merck’s Keytruda: Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, has gained FDA approval for yet another indication. The cancer therapy, which is already available for a wide range of indications, can now be used in previously-treated patients with recurrent locally advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma whose tumors express PD-L1. This marks the tenth new indication for Keytruda over a three-year period.Keytruda is a key product in Merck’s portfolio with the drug bringing in sales of $1.5 billion in the first half of 2017. The company is working on expanding the label of the drug which is currently in more than 550 studies covering a wide range of cancers and treatment settings (Read more: Merck's Keytruda Gets FDA Nod for Advanced Gastric Cancer).Merck is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Allergan Announces Share Buy Back, CFO Departure: Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) continues to work on returning capital to its shareholders with the company announcing its intention to buy back shares worth $2 billion. This comes shortly after the company completed a $15 billion share buyback program. Allergan also reaffirmed its commitment to increase its cash dividend every year while reiterating its commitment to maintaining investment grade credit ratings and paying down $3.75 billion of debt in 2018.The company also announced the departure of Tessa Hilado, executive vice president and chief financial officer (""CFO""), who will be retiring from the company once a successor is appointed.Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo Gets Another Approval: Bristol-Myers also gained approval for another indication for its immune-oncology therapy, Opdivo. With the latest approval, Opdivo can now be used for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma patients previously treated with Nexavar (sorafenib). This makes Opdivo the first and only immuno-oncology agent to be approved for this patient population (Read more: Bristol-Myers Opdivo Gets Approval for Liver Cancer).The company also gained approval in Japan for the use of Opdivo for the treatment of unresectable advanced or recurrent gastric cancer which has progressed after chemotherapy. Gastric cancer is highly prevalent in Asian countries and is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in Japan.Bristol-Myers also entered into a clinical trial collaboration with AbbVie under which a combination of Opdivo and AbbVie’s investigational antibody drug conjugate ABBV-399 will be evaluated in c-met overexpressing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Bristol-Myers stock has gained 8.1% year to date, compared to the 17.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.Priority Review for Aradigm Drug: Aradigm got priority review for Linhaliq for the treatment of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFBE) patients with chronic infections with pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). A response from the agency regarding the approval status of the drug should be out by Jan 26, 2018. NCFBE, a severe, chronic and rare disease, affects more than 150,000 people in the United States and over 200,000 people in Europe. With no drug currently approved for the treatment of this condition, there is significant unmet need. Aradigm’s shares were up 32.8% on the news.PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index is down 0.1% so far this week. Among major stocks, Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) is up 0.9% while Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) is down 1.3%.

2205,PFE,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted approval to Mylotarg for adult patients with newly diagnosed CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The drug also received approval to treat relapsed or refractory CD33-positive AML in adults as well as children (2 years and older).The approval was expected as the FDA’s Oncologic Drug Advisory Committee had voted in favor of Mylotarg’s approval in July 2017.However, it should be noted that the U.S. label of the drug will include a boxed warning for hepatotoxicity including severe or fatal hepatic veno-occlusive disease.Pfizer’s shares have gained 4.6% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s increase of 12.3%.The approval was granted based on data from multiple investigator-led clinical trials, including ALFA-0701, AML-19 and MyloFrance-1.The ALFA-0701 phase III study evaluated Mylotarg in combination with chemotherapy in newly diagnosed AML patients. The drug showed significant improvement in event-free survival (EFS), achieving 17.3 months compared to 9.5 months for chemotherapy.The phase III AML-19 study compared Mylotarg as monotherapy with best supportive care in elderly AML patients who are intolerant to other therapies. Mylotarg achieved a better median overall survival period of 4.9 months versus 3.6 months for best supportive care.MyloFrance-1, a phase II study, evaluated single agent Mylotarg in relapsing AML patients. The study showed that almost 26% of patients achieved complete remission and the median relapse-free survival achieved was 11.6 months.It is evident from the above studies that Mylotarg’s achievements support its risk benefit profile in AML patients.We remind investors that Mylotarg was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in 2000 as a single agent for treating CD33-positive AML in patients who had experienced their first relapse and were 60 years or older. However, 10 years later, Pfizer voluntarily removed Mylotarg from the market as data from a post approval phase III study, SWOG S0106, showed no clinical benefit and rate of fatalities due to treatment-related toxicity was significantly higher.Per the press release, CD33 antigen occurs in nearly 90% of AML patients. In fact, AML occurs in nearly 80% of acute leukemia patients. Moreover, Mylotarg is the first approved therapy for pediatric AML, which will give Mylotarg first-mover advantage. An estimated 21,380 patients in the United States are expected to be diagnosed with AML in 2017 including 500 children, as per the data published in the press release.Chemotherapy is the current preferred therapy for treating AML. With Mylotarg’s approval a new therapy with improved benefits will be available to patients. However, several other companies are also developing therapies for treating AML. These include Seattle Genetics, Inc.’s (SGEN  -  Free Report) SGN-CD33A and Intrexon Corporation’s (XON  -  Free Report) CD33-specific CAR+ T therapy. In August 2017, the FDA approved Celgene Corporation’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Idhifa as an oral treatment for relapsed or refractory AML patients.Pfizer, Inc. Price and Consensus  Pfizer, Inc.

2206,PFE,"The FDA, which approved 22 novel drugs last year, has given its approval to 31 drugs so far in 2017 including five in August. Key approvals this year include Gilead’s Vosevi (hepatitis C virus), Puma’s Nerlynx (to reduce the risk of breast cancer returning), J&J’s Tremfya (moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis), Regeneron/Sanofi’s Kevzara (rheumatoid arthritis), Roche’s multiple sclerosis treatment, Ocrevus, Regeneron and Sanofi’s eczema treatment, Dupixent, Tesaro’s PARP inhibitor, Zejula, and BioMarin’s Brineura (treatment of a specific form of Batten disease) among others. Some of these drugs have blockbuster potential.A recent landmark approval was that of Novartis’ Kymriah, making it the first gene therapy in the United States. This marks the beginning of a new era for the treatment of cancer and other serious and life-threatening diseases.With the drug development process being lengthy and time-consuming and requiring the utilization of a lot of funds and resources, key pipeline events including data readouts and regulatory updates are of paramount importance and could act as major catalysts. Here is a look at a few important regulatory events scheduled for the month of September.Will the FDA Follow the Advisory Panel Vote for Mylan’s Herceptin Biosimilar?Mylan NV (MYL  -  Free Report) should hear from the FDA soon about the approval status of its biosimilar version of Roche’s blockbuster drug, Herceptin (trastuzumab). The company and its partner, Biocon Ltd. got a favorable vote (16-0) from the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (“ODAC”) in July for the biosimilar. Herceptin is approved for a wide range of indications including HER2+ breast cancer in the metastatic and adjuvant settings.Earlier this year, Mylan had entered into a global settlement agreement with Roche’s Genentech, and F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. for Herceptin (trastuzumab), under which Mylan got global licenses (excluding Japan, Brazil and Mexico) for its trastuzumab product. Mylan could well be the first to launch a biosimilar version of Herceptin in the United States. Approval would boost investor sentiment for the company which has lost 17.3% year to date versus the 17.9% decline of its industry.FDA Advisory Panels to Discuss Glaxo, Pfizer & PTC Therapeutics DrugsQuite a few FDA advisory panel meetings are scheduled for this month. The FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Committee (VRBPAC) will be meeting on Sep 13 to discuss the safety and effectiveness of GlaxoSmithKline plc’s (GSK  -  Free Report) Shingrix. Glaxo is looking to get the non-live, recombinant vaccine approved for the prevention of herpes zoster (shingles) in people who are 50 years old or above. Shingles, a common and potentially serious condition, can cause lasting pain and other complications such as scarring or visual impairment.Then on Sep 19, the FDA’s ODAC will be meeting to discuss the supplemental new drug application (sNDA) submitted by Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) for its cancer drug, Sutent. Pfizer is looking to expand Sutent’s label for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients at high risk of recurrent renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”) following nephrectomy (surgical removal of the cancer-containing kidney). The FDA is expected to render a final decision regarding the label expansion in Jan 2018. Sutent brought in sales of $529 million in the first half of 2017.Later this month, on Sep 28, the FDA’s Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee will discuss PTC Therapeutics’ (PTCT  -  Free Report) new drug application (“NDA”) for Translarna (ataluren) for the treatment of patients with dystrophinopathy due to a nonsense mutation in the dystrophin gene. Translarna is already approved outside the United States. The FDA is expected to give a response regarding the approval status of the drug by Oct 24, 2017.Will the FDA Grant Approval to Amgen/Allergan’s Avastin Biosimilar?Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Allergan are also expecting a decision from the FDA for their biosimilar version of Roche’s cancer drug, Avastin (bevacizumab). With the companies getting a favorable vote from an FDA advisory panel (“ODAC”) recently, chances of gaining approval on the FDA action date of Sep 14 look good. Shares of Amgen have gained 22.2% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s rally of 15.9%.Merck, Bristol-Myers Seek Label ExpansionMerck (MRK  -  Free Report) is looking to expand the label of its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, for use in the treatment of recurrent or advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. Keytruda is under priority review for this indication with a response expected on Sep 22. Keytruda, which brought in sales of $1.5 billion in the first half of 2017, is a key product in Merck’s portfolio and is being evaluated for a wide range of indications. Merck has gained 8.4% year to date versus the 12.3% growth of its industry.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) is also looking to expand the label of its PD-1 inhibitor, Opdivo. Opdivo is under priority review for use in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (“HCC”) after prior treatment with Nexavar (sorafenib). The FDA is expected to give a response on Sep 24, 2017. Opdivo, one of the prioritized brands in Bristol-Myers’ portfolio, brought in sales of $2.3 billion in the first half of 2017. Bristol-Myers has gained 2.5% year to date versus the 12.3% growth of its industry.Will the FDA Approve J&J’s Plivensia?Johnson & Johnson’s investigational rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”) treatment, Plivensia (sirukumab), an IL-6 inhibitor, is under FDA review with a response expected on Sep 23. However, early in August, Plivensia failed to get the support of the FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee on safety concerns. J&J is looking to get Plivensia approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response or are intolerant to one or more disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). RA is a common, chronic, life-long, autoimmune disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States. Although the FDA is not required to do so, it usually follows the advice of its advisory panels. Considering the safety concerns raised by the panel, it’s quite likely that the agency will ask for additional information before granting approval. Shares of J&J have gained 13.7% year to date, outperforming the industry’s rally.Neos Therapeutics is also awaiting a decision this month for NT-0201, its amphetamine XR liquid suspension product candidate for attention deficit hyperactive disorder (“ADHD”). Approval on Sep 15, 2017 would allow the company to go ahead with its plans to launch the product in Jan 2018.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

2207,PFE,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda as a monotherapy for third-line treatment of advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.Keytruda is already approved for many types of cancers and treatment settings including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical hodgkin lymphoma and bladder cancer.The drug’s label has now been expanded to include treatment of heavily pre-treated patients with recurrent locally advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer whose tumors express PD-L1, as determined by an FDA approved test. However, the approval for this tenth new indication for Keytruda comes on an accelerated basis with continued approval dependent on further benefit demonstrated from clinical studies.The FDA approval was based on data from the KEYNOTE-059 study.Keytruda is key top line driver for Merck and it brought in sales of $881 million in second-quarter 2017, up 51% sequentially and 180% year over year.Sales continue to be driven by launch of new indications globally. Keytruda sales in the U.S. gained particularly from strong momentum in the new indication of first-line lung cancer. Outside U.S, Keytruda sales were primarily driven by the melanoma indication.Meanwhile, the Keytruda development program also significantly advanced this year with regulatory approvals for four new indications in the U.S. and two additional indications in Europe. Important approvals include that for advanced bladder cancer in both United States and the EU, advanced microsatellite instability-high cancers and first approval as a combination therapy with Eli Lilly & Company’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drug Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo),), a commonly used chemo regimen, in lung cancer. Further Keytruda data readouts are pending this year.Keytruda is continuously growing and expanding into new indications and markets globally. Keytruda is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer in more than 550 studies, including more than 300 combination studies.Merck is collaborating with several companies including Amgen, Inc.

2208,PFE,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) and German partner Merck KGaA announced that their anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, Bavencio (avelumab), has been granted marketing authorization in the EU as a monotherapy for treating adult patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC), a rare and aggressive skin cancer. The company expects to make the drug commercially available in the EU along with Germany and the U.K. within the next month.Notably, with this approval, the drug will now be marketed in the 28 countries of the EU including Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland. It is the first approved immunotherapy in the EU for the given indication.Bavencio received the FDA approval for mMCC in March. With the approval, the drug became the first immunotherapy option for the said cancer treatment. In May, Bavencio received the FDA approval for a second indication. The drug was approved for urothelial carcinoma, an aggressive disease with a high rate of recurrence. Also, earlier this month, the drug was granted with an approval in Switzerland for treatment of mMCC.Pfizer’s shares are up 10.7% so far this year, comparing unfavorably with the 16.6% rally of the industry during the period.The approval was supported by positive data from the phase II study, JAVELIN Merkel 200.We remind investors that the approval follows a positive opinion adopted by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), recommending approval of Bavencio for mMCC in July.Pfizer will focus on Bavencio, continuously growing and expanding into new indications and markets globally.Also, Bavencio is being evaluated in collaboration with Merck KGaA for different types of cancers including late stage-studies for renal cell carcinoma, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, plus head and neck cancer.Although Pfizer is a major player in immunotherapy, there are several other big and small companies, looking to develop and introduce immunotherapy treatments to the market.As a matter of fact, Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) is conducting numerous studies to evaluate its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, for more than 30 types of cancer in more than 550 studies, including more than 300 combination studies. AstraZeneca plc’s (AZN  -  Free Report) recently approved immuno-oncology drug Imfinzi (durvalumab) is being assessed for multiple cancers (either alone or in combination with other regimens) and has bright long-term prospects.Smaller biotechs are also working to bring innovative immuno-oncology treatments to the market. Kite Pharma's  lead drug axicabtagene ciloleucel is currently under priority review in the United States for treating aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with an FDA decision expected on Nov 29.However, we believe, Bavencio can give these drugs a tough run for their money as there is ample scope for growth in the immuno-oncology space.Pfizer, Inc.

2209,PFE,"The Dow mopped up gains over the week, buoyed by announcements from the Federal Reserve. A decline in tensions between the United States and North Korea led to gains for the index on Monday. The index moved higher on Tuesday on speculation that the Fed would declare that it would be trimming its balance sheet. The actual announcement led to further gains on Wednesday. Ultimately, the index snapped its nine-day stretch of gains on Thursday after stocks lost their luster following the Fed’s announcement.  Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow gained 0.3% last Friday, marking its sixth consecutive session of gains.

Further, investors focused on the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) two-day meeting. This gave rise to speculation that the Fed might start unwinding its $4.5-trillion balance sheet and boosted U.S. Treasury yields, leading to broad based gains for the financial sector.

2211,PFE,"AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 earnings on Oct 27, before the opening bell.AbbVie’s shares have soared 47.8% so far this year, while the industry has recorded an increase of 20.2%.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 1.43%. Notably, AbbVie’s earnings history is a mixed bag as the pharmaceuticals company beat estimates in two of the last four quarters and recorded in-line earnings in the other two. The four-quarter average beat is 0.76%.AbbVie Inc. Price and EPS Surprise AbbVie Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | AbbVie Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Factors to ConsiderAbbVie expects third-quarter 2017 earnings in the range of $1.36-$1.38 per share. Revenues are estimated to grow approximately 9% on an operational basis. Foreign exchange is not expected impact the sales in the third quarter.The company’s key drug, Humira, is likely to remain the main growth driver in the third quarter, backed by higher demand. This quarter, AbbVie expects Humira sales to rise in the high-teens range while internationally, sales are estimated to increase in a mid-single-digit range on an operational basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimates for Humira is $4.6 billion for the third quarter.Significantly, cancer drug Imbruvica recorded strong sales since the past few quarters, a trend that we expect to continue. In the quarter to be reported, Imbruvica was approved by the FDA for treating adult patients with chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) disease after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy. Imbruvica’s expanded label should also contribute to its sales growth. The company expects the drug’s U.S. sales growth to approach 30% in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Imbruvica is $676 million for this quarter.Other drugs like Duopa and Creon are also expected to continue to perform well in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.However, Abbvie’s Hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment, Viekira, will continue to be adversely impacted by an intense pricing and competitive pressure in the HCV market.Notably, AbbVie’s eight-week, pan-genotypic, ribavirin-free, once-daily HCV treatment, Mavyret/Maviret, gained approval in the United States, EU and Canada earlier in July/August.The company believes that Maviret has potential to rejuvenate growth in the HCV franchiseas compared to the competitive dynamics in the HCV market. We expect management to update on commercialization plans of Maviret at the conference call.Maviret is expected to contribute considerably to revenues only from 2018 onward.The company has made significant progress with its pipeline during the quarter, which will be another focus for investors to keep tabs on. AbbVie and partner Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced positive data from a phase III MURANO study of Venclexta plus Rituxan in September to expand the label to address the broader relapsed/refractory CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia) patient population. Label expansion for this indication should increase the patient population for Venclexta significantly and boost its commercial potential. Also, in the same month, the company announced that its oral JAK-1 selective inhibitor, upadacitinib (ABT-494), met primary endpoints in a phase III study for treatment of RA (rheumatoid arthritis).Additionally, AbbVie and partner Neurocrine Biosciences announced that the new drug application (NDA) for elagolix has been submitted to the FDA in September. AbbVie is looking to get elagolix approved as an oral medicine for pain management associated with endometriosis.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that AbbVie is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: AbbVie has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.39 per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Though AbbVie’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, its 0.00% Earnings ESP makes the surprise prediction difficult.We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some health care stocks that you may want to consider as per our model, these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this quarter:Merck & Company, Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Oct 27. This Zacks #3 Ranked company has an Earnings ESP of +0.61%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Oct 31.

2212,PFE,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 2.5% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Pfizer Surpasses Q2 Earnings Estimates, Misses SalesPfizer’s reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $0.67, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.65 by 3.1%. Earnings also rose 5% year over year as a weak top line performance was offset by higher gross margins and lower share count.Revenues totaled $12.90 billion, which fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.02 billion. Again, revenues declined 2% from the year-ago period due to currency headwinds and divestiture of Hospira infusion systems business in Feb 2017.Sales in DetailCurrency movement impacted Pfizer’s second-quarter revenues by 2% ($202 million). Sales growth was flat on an operational basis. Excluding HIS revenues and currency impact, sales rose 2% on an operational basis.Lower sales of Enbrel and the Prevnar/Prevenar 13 vaccines franchise and loss of exclusivity for some products  offset strong performance of key products like Ibrance (breast cancer), Xtandi (prostate cancer) and Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis).International revenues declined 3% (flat on an operational basis) to $6.55 billion. Meanwhile, U.S. revenues were flat at $6.34 billion.Segment DiscussionFrom the second quarter of 2016, Pfizer reorganized its reporting segments to Pfizer Innovative Health (IH) and Pfizer Essential Health (EH).Pfizer IH sales grew 8% (up 9% operationally) from the year-ago period to $7.67 billion.Pfizer IH revenues were driven by persistently strong momentum of Ibrance and Eliquis globally and growth of Lyrica and Xeljanz primarily in the U.S.While Ibrance revenues rose 66% to $853 million in the quarter, Xeljanz rose 55% to $336 million. Lyrica sales rose 5% to $1.10 billion. Eliquis alliance revenues and direct sales rose 50% to $605 million.Revenues from Xtandi, added to Pfizer’s portfolio following the Sep 2016 Medivation acquisition, also propelled U.S. revenues. Xtandi recorded alliance revenues of $141 million in the quarter compared with $131 million in the first quarter.This was partially offset by continued decline in revenues from Prevnar 13 in U.S. and lower revenues of Enbrel and Viagra.Enbrel revenues declined 20% to $617 million in key European markets due to biosimilar competition.Viagra sales declined 15% to $255 million due to lower sales in the U.S. and international markets on reduced demand.Global Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 revenues declined 8% to $1.15 billion. Prevnar 13 revenues tanked 16% in the U.S. due to “high initial capture rate” of the eligible adult patient population following its successful 2014 launch. This resulted in a smaller remaining “catch up” opportunity in the second quarter compared with the year-ago quarter. Unfavorable timing of government purchases for the pediatric indication also hurt U.S. sales.Eucrisa (crisaborole) topical ointment for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (eczema), which was bought as part of the Jun 2016 Anacor acquisition, was launched in the U.S. in first quarter of 2017. The ointment recorded sales of $9 million in the second quarter.While Consumer Healthcare revenues rose 1% to $846 million, Global Oncology revenues surged 44% to $1.59 billion driven by Ibrance. Global Vaccine revenues declined 7% to $1.27 billion. While Internal Medicine rose 10% to $2.41 billion, the Inflammation & Immunology franchise declined 1% to $992 million. Additionally, the portfolio of Rare Disease declined 8% to $562 million.Pfizer EH segment sales recorded a decline of 14% (down 12% operationally) to $5.23 billion. Excluding HIS revenues, EH sales declined 7%.EH revenues were hurt by the loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for products like Pristiq (generic versions launched in the U.S. in Mar 2017), Vfend, Zyvox, Celebrex, Lyrica; lower revenues from legacy Hospira products and divesture of HIS. However, in the EH business, biosimilars and emerging markets did well in the quarter.While Inflectra recorded sales of $23 million in the U.S. and $94 million globally, all other biosimilars brought in sales of $27 million (down 18%) from outside the U.S. markets. Emerging markets revenues grew 5% operationally.At the call, the company said that Inflectra penetration in the U.S. has been slower than expected as it is experiencing access challenges among national commercial payers.Adjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI&A) expenses were flat (operationally) in the quarter at $3.39 billion. Adjusted R&D expenses rose 2% to $1.77 billion.2017 GuidanceWhile Pfizer raised the lower end of its adjusted earnings guidance, it retained the revenue expectations for the year. Revenues are expected in the range of $52 billion to $54 billion.Adjusted earnings per share are expected in the range of $2.54 - $2.60 compared with $2.50–$2.60 expected previously. Higher than previously anticipated royalty income from certain products and lower interest cost led to the increase in the lower end of the profit outlook.At the mid-point, revenues are expected to be slightly above 2016 level, while adjusted EPS is expected to increase 7% (previously 6%).Research and development expenses are still expected in the range of $7.5–$8.0 billion, while SI&A spending is projected in the range of $13.7–$14.7 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been three revisions higher for the current quarter compared to two lower.Pfizer, Inc. Price and Consensus  Pfizer, Inc. Price and Consensus | Pfizer, Inc.

2213,PFE,"The Medicines Company (MDCO  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted accelerated approval to its experimental antibiotic, Vabomere, a combination of meropenem and vaborbactam, for treating complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), including the pyelonephritis.The company expects to make Vabomere available in the market in fourth-quarter 2017. It filed a new drug application (NDA) for the antibiotic in February, currently under review in the EU.Shares of The Medicines Company have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has rallied 14.2% compared with the industry’s 9.7% gain during the period.The NDA was supported by positive data from a phase III (TANGO-1) multi-center, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study. The study (n=550) was designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of Vabomere in patients with cUTIs or acute pyelonephritis compared with Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam).Data from this trial showed that Vabomere achieved statistical superiority over Zosyn with successful results obtained from 98.4% of patients treated with Vabomere compared with 94.3% administered with Zosyn.We remind investors that in July, an independent data safety and monitoring board stopped the phase III TANGO-2 study on Vabomere based on an interim analysis. Interim results from the study showed that Vabomere improved clinical cure rates across all infection types and reduced rate of renal adverse events in comparison to the best available therapy.Vabomere has been designated as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product by the FDA. Antibiotic resistance, especially to carbapenems, is a rapidly growing problem in the medicine sector. In fact, carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (CRE) infections are one of the deadliest diseases, given its 40% mortality rate. As a result, there is an urgent need for antimicrobials like Vabomere to effectively treat CRE and other resistant organisms.Successful commercialization of Vabomere is expected to boost the company’s top line, considering the lucrative market that it targets.The Medicines Company PriceThe Medicines Company Price | The Medicines Company QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderThe Medicines Company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2215,PFE,"As demand for immuno-oncology drugs and their combinations rises, Pfizer, Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) newly approved immunotherapy, Bavencio, is being considered a significant top-line driver for this New York-based pharma giant.Pfizer’s shares are up 5.8% so far this year, comparing unfavorably with an increase of 13.3% for the industry. Bavencio (previously avelumab) received FDA approval for metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a rare and aggressive skin cancer, in Mar 2017. With the FDA approval, Bavencio became the first immunotherapy option for the treatment of metastatic MCC. In May, Bavencio received FDA approval for a second indication. The drug was approved for urothelial carcinoma, an aggressive disease with a high rate of recurrence. Meanwhile, Bavencio is under review in the EU for MCC with a decision expected in the third quarter of 2017. Last month, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted a positive opinion recommending approval of Bavencio for MCC.Pfizer will focus on continuously growing and expanding Bavencio into new indications and markets globally.Meanwhile, Bavencio is being studied in different types of cancers - including late stage-studies for renal cell carcinoma, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, head and neck cancer - in collaboration with Merck KGaA. Pfizer has also initiated avelumab double/triple combination studies for chemotherapy and targeted therapies and has 11 avelumab combination therapies with immuno-oncology agents under development.Immuno-oncology or immunotherapy is a new class of cancer therapy that utilizes certain parts of the immune system to fight the disease. This can be done by stimulating the immune system to attack cancer cells or by introducing immune system components into the body.  Immuno-oncology drugs and their combinations are in great demandAlthough Pfizer is among the major players in immunotherapy, there are several other companies, big as well as small, looking to develop and bring immunotherapy treatments to market.Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) is conducting numerous studies to evaluate its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda for more than 30 types of cancer in more than 550 studies, including more than 300 combination studies. AstraZeneca plc’s (AZN  -  Free Report) recently approved immuno-oncology drug Imfinzi (durvalumab) is being evaluated for multiple cancers (either alone or in combination with other regimens) and has bright long-term prospects.Meanwhile, smaller biotechs are also working to bring innovative immuno-oncology treatments to market. Kite Pharma’s lead drug axicabtagene ciloleucel is currently under priority review in the U.S. for treating aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with a FDA decision expected on Nov 29. Juno Therapeutics and Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) are developing JCAR017 and CTL019, respectively utilizing the CAR T cell technology.However, we believe that Bavencio can give these drugs a tough run as there is ample scope for growth in the immuno-oncology space.Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2216,PFE,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) and partner Avillion announced that a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Bosulif has been accepted and granted priority review by the FDA.We remind investors that Bosulif is currently approved for the treatment of chronic, accelerated or blast phase Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in adults who are resistant or intolerant to prior therapy.The company is looking to get the drug approved for the first-line treatment of patients suffering from chronic phase Ph+ CML. A decision from the FDA is expected in December 2017.Additionally, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has also accepted a similar regulatory application for review.Pfizer shares have gained 3.1% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 11.4% in the same period.The application also includes patients who are not eligible for treatment with Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Gleevec or Tasigna and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Sprycel.The regulatory application in the U.S. and EU based on data from the phase III BFORE study, which evaluated a 400 mg dose of Bosulif in newly diagnosed Ph+ CML patients. The results showed that Bosulif achieved major molecular response at 12 months in significantly higher number of patients compared to Gleevec.Per the press release, there are 48,000 patients with CML in the U.S. and 9,000 new cases are expected to be diagnosed in 2017. This represents an opportunity for Bosulif if approved as first-line treatment for Ph+ CML.Pfizer is expecting a decision from the FDA on label expansion of another leukemia drug, Mylotarg in first-line setting for treating acute myeloid leukemia in September 2017. In July, the FDA’s advisory panel had voted in favor of approval of the sNDA for Mylotarg.Pfizer, Inc. Price and Consensus  Pfizer, Inc. Price and Consensus | Pfizer, Inc.

2217,PFE,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) announced detailed data from a large phase III cardiovascular outcomes study (REVEAL) evaluating anacetrapib, a cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor in patients with cardiovascular disease.Data from the phase III study showed that anacetrapib and a statin reduced the risk of major coronary events (composite of coronary death, myocardial infarction, and coronary revascularization) by 9% relative to placebo in patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease who are already receiving an effective cholesterol treatment. While anacetrapib reduced the risk to 10.8%, the same was 11.8% for patients on a placebo and a statin. However, no significant benefit was observed in reducing the risk of ischemic stroke.The detailed data were published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the European Society of Cardiology Congress.Merck’s shares have risen 7.2% this year so far, comparing unfavorably with an 11.2% increase for the industry.Top-line data from the study was announced in June 2017 wherein the company said that the study had met the primary endpoint. It also said that the CETP inhibitorled to significant reduction in major coronary eventsversus placebo in patients at high risk of cardiovascular events who are already receiving an effective cholesterol treatment. However, the details have only been mentioned now.The company-funded REVEAL study was conducted in more than 30,000 patients who were taking atorvastatin – a common medicine for lowering ""bad"" cholesterol or LDL - for a median duration of at least four years.It was also said that anacetrapib’s safety profile was in line with that observed in previous studies with the most significant side effect being the accumulation of anacetrapib in adipose or fat tissue for years after taking the drug.As announced in June, Merck is not sure whether the data are strong enough to seek approval and plans to review the results with external experts. The company will then consider whether to file regulatory applications with the FDA and other agencies.We remind investors that three previous experimental CETP inhibitors had failed in their respective studies. CETP inhibitors are designed to raise HDL-cholesterol levels or what is known as “good” cholesterol.In 2015, Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) terminated the development of its late-stage CETP inhibitor, evacetrapib based on the recommendation of an independent data monitoring committee, which suggested that chances of meeting the primary endpoint were low. Back in 2006, Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) had suspended the late-stage development of its CETP inhibitor, torceptrapib, due to safety issues. In 2012, Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) discontinued the development of its CETP inhibitor, dalcetrapib, due to lack of efficacy.However, uncertainty regarding whether or not the company will actually file the data with regulators remains. It is apprehended that the accumulation of anacetrapib in fat tissues could get in the way of regulatory approval.Merck carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2218,PFE,"Key highlights this week include a lawsuit filed by Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) accusing Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) of adopting exclusionary contracts and other anticompetitive practices to prevent biosimilar uptake. Meanwhile, companies like GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) and Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN  -  Free Report) were in the news for regulatory/pipeline updates.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesSupernus Down on Study Update: Supernus provided an update on the first phase III study on SPN-810 which is being evaluated for the treatment of impulsive aggression (“IA”) in patients aged 6 to 12 years who have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (“ADHD”). Based on a planned interim analysis, the company has decided to drop the lower dose of 18 mg from the study and patients will be randomized to receive either the 36 mg dose or placebo. Investors were disappointed by the update and shares were down 23.4% (Read more: Supernus Drops SPN-810's Lower Dose Test in Phase III Trials).  CHMP Positive on J&J Psoriasis Drug: J&J’s Tremfya (guselkumab) got a positive opinion in the EU with the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) recommending marketing authorization for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy.Timely approval would make Tremfya the first biologic that selectively blocks interleukin (IL)-23, a cytokine that plays a key role in plaque psoriasis. According to information in the press release, about 14 million people across Europe are estimated to suffer from psoriasis.Tremfya gained FDA approval earlier this year in July.Pfizer Files Suit against J&J for Biosimilars: Pfizer has filed a lawsuit against J&J in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania related to providing patient and physician access to lower cost biosimilars. According to the lawsuit, J&J has adopted exclusionary contracts and other anticompetitive practices to deny access to and undermine the benefits of price competition in the biologics market. In order to maintain its monopoly in connection with Remicade (infliximab), J&J was accused in the lawsuit of inappropriately excluding biosimilar competitors. Pfizer had launched Inflectra, its biosimilar version of Remicade, in late 2016. Biosimilars, while available in the EU for many years, are a relatively recent entrant in the United States and are yet to have a significant impact on reference product sales (Read more: Pfizer Sues J&J, Accuses it of Preventing Inflectra Uptake).Glaxo/Innoviva COPD Treatment Gets FDA Nod: Glaxo and partner Innoviva got a boost with the FDA approval of their once-daily, single inhaler triple therapy, Trelegy Ellipta, for the treatment of appropriate patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”).A combination of an inhaled corticosteroid (“ICS”), a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (“LAMA”), and a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (“LABA”), Trelegy Ellipta will provide patients with a convenient dosing option and is expected to bring in blockbuster sales (Read more: Glaxo/Innoviva's Triple Combo Therapy Gets FDA Nod for COPD). Glaxo stock has gained 4.7% year to date, compared to the 16.6% rally of the industry it belongs to.Teva Divests Women’s Health Business: Teva (TEVA  -  Free Report), which recently got a new Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), is taking steps to get its performance back on track. The company announced the sale of the remaining assets in its specialty global women’s health portfolio. The planned divestiture of this segment will bring in total proceeds of $2.48 billion which will be used by Teva to pay down debt. The decision to sell the women’s health business is part of Teva’s efforts to divest its non-core segments and focus on its key strategic areas. The company also announced amendments to its USD and JPY term loan and revolving credit facilities. Teva is currently going through tough times with the company being hit by generic pricing erosion. The company needs to work on paying down debt, divesting non-core businesses to increase focus on core areas and generate cash, delivering on the pipeline and getting the U.S. generics business back on track.Roche/AbbVie Cancer Drug Positive in Late-Stage Study: Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) and partner AbbVie are looking to expand the label of their cancer therapy, Venclexta/Venclyxto. Results from a late-stage study (MURANO) showed that Venclexta plus Rituxan met the primary endpoint of prolonged progression-free survival compared with Treanda (bendamustine) plus Rituxan in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (“CLL”). An independent data monitoring committee has recommended the unblinding of the study based on the positive results. Label expansion for this indication will expand the patient population for Venclexta significantly and boost its commercial potential (Read more: Roche Announces Positive Data on Leukemia Drug).Roche is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

Among major stocks, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) gained 1% while J&J slipped 1.8%. Over the last six months, Bristol-Myers was up 15.3% while Glaxo declined 2.4% (See the last pharma stock roundup here: Achillion Slumps on End of HCV Deal, Teva Gets a New CEO).What's Next in the Pharma World?Watch out for the usual pipeline and regulatory updates. Bristol-Myers’s PD-1 inhibitor, Opdivo, is under priority review for use in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (“HCC”) after prior treatment with Nexavar (sorafenib). The FDA is expected to give a response on Sep 24, 2017. Meanwhile, J&J is expecting a response from the FDA for its investigational rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”) treatment, Plivensia (sirukumab), an IL-6 inhibitor. However, with Plivensia failing to get the support of the FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee on safety concerns, it’s quite likely that the agency will ask for additional information before granting approval.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>

2219,PFE,"We expect  Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 27, before market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 16.09%.Merck’s performance has been pretty impressive, with the company exceeding earnings expectations in all the trailing four quarters. The average positive earnings surprise over the last four quarters is 8.11%Merck’s shares have risen 7.7% this year so far, comparing unfavorably with 20.5% increase for the industry.Factors to ConsiderMerck’s new products like Keytruda (cancer), Zepatier (HCV) and Bridion (sugammadex) Injection are likely to drive the top line this quarter.Keytruda sales in the United States are gaining particularly on the back of strong momentum in the new indication of first-line lung cancer. The Keytruda development program significantly advanced in the first half with regulatory approvals for four new indications in the United States and an additional indication in Europe. Key recent approvals include that for advanced bladder cancer, advanced microsatellite instability-high cancers and first approval as a combination therapy with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drug Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo) in lung cancer.The new approvals have expanded the patient population, which is expected to drive sales in the third quarter.However, at the Q2 call, management warned that Zepatier uptake may be impacted by the ongoing decline in overall patient volumes in many markets and increased competition. Previously, strong underlying demand trends in the United States, Europe, and Japan had supported Zepatier’s sales.The company also faces headwinds in the form of genericization as well as increasing competition and the negative impact of currency exchange.Sales of Remicade (lost exclusivity in Europe and facing stiff biosimilar competition in the region), Cubicin (lost patent protection in the United States in June 2016), Zetia (lost market exclusivity in the United States in December 2016) and Vytorin (lost U.S. exclusivity in April 2017) are likely to decline in the quarter.Sluggish growth of the integrase class and continued competitor dynamics in the United States and Europe will continue to affect Isentress’ sales. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Isentress sales is $306 million for the third quarter.Investors will also be focused on the performance of Merck’s DPP-4 inhibitor – Januvia. Pricing pressure hurt sales of the Januvia/Janumet franchise in the first half.The Vaccines and Animal Health franchises are expected to boost sales this quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Vaccines (total) and Animal Health segments is $1.83 billion and $911 million, respectively.At the Q2 call, Merck mentioned a network cyber-attack in June that disrupted its global operations, including manufacturing, research, and sales. At that time, Merck had said that full recovery from the cyber-attack will take some time, which could result in a temporary delay in fulfilling orders of some products (not Keytruda, Zepatier and Januvia) in certain markets. We expect an update on this at the upcoming conference call.Remediation expenses related to the cyber-attack, increased investments behind the ongoing launches and additional R&D costs associated with the new oncology collaboration with AstraZeneca are expected to result in higher operating costs in the quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Merck is likely to beat estimates this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for a likely positive surprise.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate ($1.03 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($1.02 per share), is +0.61%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Merck has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Merck’s Zacks Rank #3 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Merck & Company, Inc.

2220,PFE,"Investors seeking momentum may have Vanguard Healthcare ETF (VHT  -  Free Report) on radar now. The fund recently hit a new 52-week high. Shares of VHT are up approximately 29.2% from the 52-week low of $120.38/share.But could there be more gains ahead for this ETF? Let’s take a look at the fund and the near-term outlook to get a better idea of where it might be headed.VHT in FocusVHT focuses on providing exposure to healthcare stocks in the U.S. equity markets. It charges 10 basis points in fee per year and has top holdings in Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and Unitedhealth (UNH  -  Free Report) with 9.6%, 5.9% and 5.2% allocation, respectively (as of Sep 30, 2017) (see all Health Care ETFs here).Why the Move?The earnings season is off to a strong start with companies in the sector beating estimates. In a latest executive order, Trump aimed at scrapping a key component of Obamacare. The President said that he wanted to end subsidies to insurers that cost $7 billion this year and help millions of low-income Americans pay medical expenses. However, the uncertainty was reduced to some extent as news of the two political parties coming to a bipartisan deal started doing the rounds. Senators of both parties said they reached a deal to stabilize Obamacare for the short term and allow insurer subsidies. This in turn led to a rally in healthcare stocks.More Gains Ahead?Currently, VHT has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium Risk outlook. Moreover, the ETF has a weighted alpha of 22.6. So, there is a promising outlook ahead for those who want to ride this surging ETF a shade further.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

2221,PFE,"We expect GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.94%.Glaxo’s shares are up 6.7% this year so far, underperforming the 20.5% increase witnessed by the industry.Glaxo’s performance has been pretty good so far. The company’s earnings beat expectations thrice in the four trailing quarters while meeting estimates in the remaining quarter. Overall, the company has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 8.34%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors to ConsiderGlaxo should continue to see strong performance in its Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines business segment.Glaxo’s Pharmaceuticals segment is expected to be driven by strong sales of new HIV products, Tivicay and Triumeq. Sales of newly launched respiratory drugs, the Ellipta products and Nucala are expected to offset the declines in Seretide, Advair and Avodart. Many of Glaxo’s key drugs like Lovaza and Avodart are facing declining sales due to generic competition. Importantly, pricing dynamics and competitive pressure are hurting sales of its top-selling drug Advair in the United States while generic competition is hurting Advair sales in Europe. A generic version of Advair in the United States is unlikely to be approved this year.The Vaccines segment will continue benefit from continued uptake of meningitis vaccines, Bexsero and Menveo (acquired from Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report)Importantly, sales growth is slowing in the Consumer Healthcare segment due to a slowdown in market conditions and the impact of divestures. The Consumer Healthcare segment is expected to remain under pressure in the third and the fourth quarters and is not expected to contribute much to sales growth this year.Meanwhile, cost savings from restructuring and continued efficiencies should boost operating profits.In September, Glaxo and partner Innoviva gained FDA approval for their once-daily, single inhaler triple therapy, Trelegy Ellipta, for COPD. The combination of an inhaled corticosteroid (“ICS”), a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (“LAMA”), and a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (“LABA”), Trelegy Ellipta will provide patients with a convenient dosing option and is expected to bring in blockbuster sales. We expect management to comment on commercialization plans for this newly approved product at the Q3 conference call.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Glaxo is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for a likely positive surprise and Glaxo has the right mix.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate (85 cents per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (84 cents per share), is +1.80%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Glaxo has a Zacks Rank #2. The combination of Glaxo’s Zacks Rank #2 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price and EPS Surprise GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price and EPS Surprise | GlaxoSmithKline PLC QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderOther large-cap pharma stocks that have both a positive ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank includeBristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report), scheduled to release results on Oct 26, with an Earnings ESP of +1.05% and a Zacks Rank #3.

2222,PFE,"The healthcare sector has been in the spotlight lately. President Donald Trump targeted drug companies and accused them of charging extremely high prices (read: ETFs in Focus as IMF ups Global Growth Forecast).Market Movers""Prescription drug prices are out of control. The drug prices have gone through the roof,"" Trump said in a meeting, adding, ""The drug companies frankly are getting away with murder. We want to bring our prices down to what other countries are paying.""In a latest executive order, Trump aimed at scrapping a key component of Obamacare. The President said that he wanted to end subsidies to insurers that cost $7 billion this year and help millions of low-income Americans pay medical expenses.The uncertainty was reduced to some extent as news of the two political parties coming to a bipartisan deal started doing the rounds. Senators of both parties said they reached a deal to stabilize Obamacare for the short term and allow insurer subsidies. However, changes in the deal might be in the cards as it has to be passed by the Congress and signed by Trump first.“The solution will be for about a year or two years; it’ll get us over this intermediate hump” Trump said. Let us now discuss two ETFs focused on providing exposure to the healthcare sector.Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to healthcare stocks and tracks the Health Care Select Sector Index. It has AUM of $17.6 billion and charges a moderate fee of 14 basis points a year. It has 62 holdings and bears significant concentration risk as almost 50% of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings (read: Should You Keep Your Portfolio Healthy with Biotech ETFs?).From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Pharmaceuticals, Biotech and Health Care Providers & Services, with 33.6%, 21.9% and 19.1% exposure, respectively (as of Sep 30, 2017). The fund’s top three holdings are Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and Unitedhealth (UNH  -  Free Report) with 11.1%, 6.8% and 6.1% allocation, respectively (as of Sep 30, 2017).  The fund has returned 17.9% in a year and 19.0% year to date (as of Oct 16, 2017). XLV currently has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium risk outlook.Vanguard Healthcare ETF (VHT  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to healthcare stocks and tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Health Care 25/50 Index. It has AUM of $7.2 billion and charges a moderate fee of 10 basis points a year. It has 360 holdings and bears significant concentration risk as almost 45% of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings.From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Pharmaceuticals, Biotech and Health Care Equipment, with 30.5%, 24.6% and 17.9% exposure, respectively (as of Sep 30, 2017). The fund’s top three holdings are Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and Unitedhealth with 9.6%, 5.9% and 5.2% allocation, respectively (as of Sep 30, 2017).  The fund has returned 19.6% in a year and 20.6% year to date (as of Oct 16, 2017). VHT currently has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 with a Medium risk outlook.Bottom LineXLV is more popular than VHT, as is evident from its higher AUM. However, VHT may be more appealing to investors, owing to its cheaper expense ratio.  VHT also has a more diversified exposure in terms of number of holdings.Moreover, VHT outperformed XLV both on a year to date basis and in a year. VHT returned 1.6% more than XLV so far this year whereas in a year, it returned 1.7% more than XLV.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

2223,PFE,"Pfizer Inc (PFE  -  Free Report) and partner Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) presented findings from a phase IV study on Eliquis, which demonstrated the oral anticoagulation’s potential in achieving and maintaining normal heart rhythm (cardioversion).The study, EMANATE, compared Eliquis with standard-of-care, Heparin, for reducing the occurrence of acute stroke, systemic embolism, major bleeding, clinically relevant non-major bleeding and all-cause death in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients undergoing cardioversion.We remind investors that Eliquis is already approved for the reduction of the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF, treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) and reduction in the risk of recurrent DVT and PE following initial therapy, and prophylaxis of DVT, which may lead to PE, in patients who have undergone hip or knee replacement surgery. However, the drug is not approved for the reduction of stroke in NVAF patients undergoing cardioversion.Pfizer has underperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has gained 3% during this period, while the industry gained 11.3%.Coming back to the latest news, cardioversion procedure is associated with a concern for clotting of blood in the heart while travelling to brain (stroke) or other body parts (systemic embolism). The EMANATE study showed that there was no stroke in Eliquis group compared to six strokes in the Heparin arm. However, no systemic embolism was observed for both the drug groups. Eliquis also reduced the number of major bleeding events and clinically relevant non-major bleeding events compared to Heparin.The current standard-of-care – Heparin and Coumadin – requires monitoring and potential dose adjustment while administered for reducing the risk of stroke. However, Eliquis can be administered at a fixed dose of 5mg twice daily.We note that Eliquis, being an anticoagulant, increases the risk of bleeding, which can become serious and potentially fatal.The company also announced data from a real-world analysis of Eliquis in NVAF patients in a separate press release. Per the analysis, Eliquis showed lower risk of stroke/SE and lower rates of major bleeding compared to Coumadin in NVAF patients as well as for each of the selected high-risk patient sub-populations.Eliquis faces competition in the anticoagulant segment from Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Xarelto and Boehringer Ingelheim’s Pradaxa. With the approval of Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (PTLA  -  Free Report) Bevyxxa in June 2017competition is expected to intensify.Stroke events are a major concern for NVAF patient. The above findings show that Eliquis may become a preferred treatment for the same which may boost the potential of the drug. If Pfizer and Bristol-Myers try to get the label of Eliquis expanded to include the findings, it will give the drug an edge over other marketed blood thinners.Pfizer, Inc.

2224,PFE,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) has filed a lawsuit in a U.S. district court alleging that Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) is resorting to unfair practices to prevent sale of Inflectra - Pfizer’s biosimilar version of J&J and Merck& Co., Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug, Remicade. Pfizer’s biosimilar version is available at a Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC), which is 19% lower than J&J’s referenced product.Pfizer’s shares were up 1.6% on Wednesday while J&J’s shares were down 1.5%. However, Pfizer’s shares have underperformed the industry this year so far. The stock has returned 10.8% during this period, comparing unfavorably with an increase of 16.7% for the industry.Pfizer alleged in a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania that J&J has entered into “biosimilar-exclusion” contracts with U.S. insurers. These contracts encourage insurers not to cover Inflectra, thereby making it non easily-accessible to patients and protecting its referenced product. Pfizer also claimed that anticompetitive contracts were being offered to hospitals, which encouraged discounts on purchase of Remicade on the condition that they do not buy the biosimilar versions. Pfizer claims these unfair practices benefit sales of J&J’s referenced product, which is a key revenue generator for the latter.We remind investors that at the second quarter conference call held in August, Pfizer had said that Inflectra penetration in the United States has been slower than expected as it was experiencing access challenges among national commercial payers.On the other hand, J&J had said at its second quarter conference call held in July that the rate of penetration of Inflectramay be modest. The latest lawsuit suggests that J&J could be responsible for the slow sales of Inflectra.Please note that in April this year, Samsung Bioepis’ biosimilar version of Remicade also received FDA approval.Pfizer had launched Inflectra in the United States in November last year and the biosimilar is also marketed in ex-U.S. markets. Inflectra generated sales of $23 million in the United States and $94 million globally in second quarter.Biosimilars are essentially cheaper versions of expensive biologic drugs but are complex to make unlike traditional generic drugs. While biosimilars have been available in the EU for quite a while, there was no regulatory pathway for biosimilars in the United States for a long time. However, this changed with the passing of The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act) as part of the Affordable Care Act that President Obama signed into law in March 2010.Several pharma as well as biotech companies are involved in the development of biosimilars.The first biosimilar to gain approval in the United States was Sandoz’s Zarxio, a biosimilar version of Amgen Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Neupogen. Zarxio was launched in the United States in September 2015. Inflectra was the second biosimilar to gain approval.Other approved biosimilars in the country. include Sandoz’s Erelzi, a biosimilar to Amgen’s Enbrel (etanercept) and Amgen’s Amjevita, a biosimilar version of Abbvie’s Humira. However, these have not been launched yet due to ongoing litigation.Earlier this month, FDA approved the first cancer biosimilar, Amgen and Allergan’s Mvasi, a biosimilar version of Roche’s blockbuster cancer drug, Avastin.Biosimilars were expected to reduce health care costs and provide a large number of patients with access to much needed biologic treatments. However, so far biosimilars have not seen much commercial success and are yet to make a significant dent in referenced product sales in the United States.The fight between these two drug giants is likely to aid efforts to lower drug prices through increased biosimilar availability.Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research. It's not the one you think. See This Ticker Free >>

The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 0.1% to close at 2,508.24. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,456.04, decreasing 0.1%. A total of 6.7 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, higher than the last 20-session average of 6 billion shares.

The Fed plans to begin the gradual unwinding process in October and also announced that it plans to trim the assets by $10 billion each month. Fed also stated that this rate would be increased further by another $10 billion every three months to gradually reach a maximum of $50 billion a month.Such assets consist primarily of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities, which the Fed accumulated in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis under its quantitative easing program. This was done in a bid to keep the mortgage rates low and provide liquidity to the economy.Fed Indicates a Possible Rate Hike in DecemberThe Fed kept the interest- rates unchanged as expected. Currently pegged at 1% to 1.25%, the central bank announced that it expects to hike the interest rate to 1.4% by the year end. Moreover, it maintained its initial forecast for 2018, expecting to hike the benchmark interest rate to 2.1%. However, the Fed decreased its outlook for 2019 from its initial forecast in June. The Fed stated that it anticipates the interest rate to hover around 2.7% by the end of 2019, lower than the initial forecast of 2.9%.The Fed’s interest rate projections, known as the dot-plot, indicated that there might be one rate hike in December, three more in 2018 and two further rate hikes in 2019. The CME FedWatch now estimated the possibility of a rate hike in December to 70%.Such hawkish statements from the Fed led to a surge in the 10-year Treasury yield by 2.3%. The 2-year Treasury note yield surged 1.5% — its highest level since November 2008. This boosted the financial shares and boded well for banks. The SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) rose 1.2% to 43.25 and the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLF) surged almost 0.6%. Shares of banks also rose following Fed’s announcement. Shares Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report), JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), PNC Financial Services (PNC  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) and Citibank (C  -  Free Report) all gained 0.4%, 0.7%, 1.3%, 0.8% and 0.4% respectively.Existing Home Sales Hit Its Worst Level in 12 monthsExisting home sales for the month of August came in at 5.35 million, lower than the consensus estimate of 5.46 million and hit its worst level in the last 12 months. This figure is also lower than 5.44 million units for the month of July.Existing home sales has dropped for the fourth time in the last five months and economists commented that this was because of a paucity of available homes that can be bought.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

2226,PFE,"We issued an updated report on Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (CPRX  -  Free Report) on Aug 14.In fact, Catalyst Pharma is a development-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapies targeting rare neurological diseases and disorders such as Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), epilepsy (initially infantile spasms) and Tourette syndrome.At present, this Coral Gables, FL-based company has two candidates under development – Firdapse and CPP-115.The company expects to report top-line results from its second phase III study of Firdapse for the treatment of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) in the second half of 2017 and resubmit a new drug application (NDA) before the end of 2017. Earlier in 2016, it received a refusal to file letter from the FDA in connection with the NDA for Firdapse.Notably, the agency had determined that the company’s NDA was insufficient after a preliminary review. Consequently, Catalyst Pharma was required to conduct additional studies as per the agency’s requirements, in addition to the results of its previously submitted phase III data.In Oct 2016, it reached an agreement with the FDA under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) for the protocol design, clinical endpoints, and statistical analysis approach to be taken in its second phase III study evaluating Firdapse.Meanwhile, the company is working on developing Firdapse for additional indications. Catalyst initiated an investigator-sponsored phase II/III study on Firdapse for the symptomatic treatment of MuSK-antibody positive MG in Feb 2016.  In Mar 2017, the company reported top-line data from the phase II/III trial.The potential approval of Firdapse, along with its label expansion will help in generating revenues for the company.Additionally, Catalyst Pharma is exploring the possibility of developing CPP-115 (a GABA aminotransferase inhibitor) for the treatment of epilepsy (initially infantile spasms) and the treatment of other selected neurological indications such as complex partial seizures and Tourette’s disorder.However, the market for epilepsy treatments is highly competitive and crowded given the presence of products like Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Neurontin and Lyrica, Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Topamax, Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Trileptal.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

2227,PFE,"This week, companies like Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) and Teva (TEVA  -  Free Report) reported second quarter results. While Pfizer reported a mixed quarter, Allergan topped expectations. Teva, however, had a tough quarter. Meanwhile, Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) announced immune-oncology (IO) focused deals including an acquisition.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesA Look at Q2 Earnings Results: Big companies like Pfizer, Allergan and Teva reported second quarter results this week. Pfizer surpassed earnings estimates but missed on revenues raising concerns about the company’s top-line growth prospects. While Prevnar and Enbrel sales declined during the quarter, Pfizer is facing two key loss of exclusivities (LOEs) in the U.S. -- Viagra later this year and Lyrica at the end of 2018 (Read more: Pfizer Surpasses Q2 Earnings Estimates, Misses Sales).Meanwhile, Allergan topped both earnings and sales estimates and raised its outlook as well (Read more: Allergan Q2 Earnings & Sales Top, Restasis Sales Down).Teva’s shares fell 24% on a dismal quarter with the company missing on earnings and sales reflecting the performance of the U.S. generics business and the continued deterioration in Venezuela. The generics business was hit by accelerated price erosion and lower volume mainly due to customer consolidation, higher competition, and delayed new product launches. Teva lowered its outlook for the year and slashed its dividend as well. The company also expects to exit 45 markets across the globe by year end and will be cutting its headcount by about 7,000 since the closing of the Actavis Generics business deal. Teva has lost 34.5% of its value year to date versus the 7.6% decline of its industry.J&J, AbbVie Drug Gets FDA Nod for cGVHD: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and AbbVie’s BTK inhibitor Imbruvica gained FDA approval for its first non-cancer indication -- chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) in adults after failure of one or more systemic lines of therapy. This makes Imbruvica the first and only approved treatment for this patient population. This marks the sixth indication for Imbruvica in the U.S. J&J stock has gained 15.8% year to date, outperforming the 10.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.Bristol-Myers in Acquisition Deal Worth Up to $2.3B: Bristol-Myers announced that it will be acquiring IFM Therapeutics, a venture-backed biotech company working on treatments that modulate novel targets in the innate immune system to treat cancer, autoimmunity and inflammatory disorders.With this acquisition, Bristol-Myers will gain full rights to IFM’s preclinical STING (stimulator of interferon genes) and NLRP3 agonist programs that are focused on cancer. The STING agonist program includes a lead asset while the NLRP3 agonist program includes a potential first-in-class pipeline candidate.This acquisition, scheduled to close in the third quarter, will strengthen Bristol-Myers’ immune-oncology (IO) pipeline. The deal will see Bristol-Myers shelling out $300 million upfront while additional payments of up to $1.01 billion will be made for each of the first products from the two programs on the achievement of certain milestones.Additional milestone payments could be made for further products resulting from these programs.Bristol-Myers signed another IO focused deal this week -- the company signed a clinical collaboration agreement with Clovis Oncology under which its immunotherapy Opdivo will be evaluated in combination with Clovis’ PARP inhibitor Rubraca in mid- and late-stage studies for different types of tumors.Meanwhile, Opdivo’s label was expanded in the U.S. this week for the treatment of adult and pediatric (12 years and older) patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) that has progressed following treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. Accelerated approval was granted on the basis of overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response.However, we note that Merck’s Keytruda gained approval earlier this year for patients with MSI-H or dMMR in a wider patient population -- Merck’s label includes patients with solid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options as well as colorectal cancer patients whose disease has progressed following treatment with certain chemotherapy drugs.J&J RA Drug Fails to Get FDA Advisory Panel Support: J&J’s investigational rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, Plivensia (sirukumab), an IL-6 inhibitor, failed to get the support of the FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee on safety concerns. The company is looking to get Plivensia approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response or are intolerant to one or more disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). RA is a common, chronic, life-long, autoimmune disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the U.S. Although the FDA is not required to do so, it usually follows the advice of its advisory panels. Considering the safety concerns raised by the panel, the agency could well ask for additional information before granting approval.Pfizer Drug Gets Advisory Panel Support: Pfizer’s supplemental new drug applications (sNDAs) for its JAK inhibitor, Xeljanz (5 mg twice daily) and Xeljanz XR (11 mg once daily), for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA), got the support of the FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee. The advisory panel voted 10 to 1 in favor of approving the proposed dose of Xeljanz for the PsA indication. A decision from the FDA should be out by Dec 2017. Xeljanz, currently approved for RA, brought in sales of $587 million in the first half of 2017.Priority Review for AstraZeneca BTK Inhibitor: AstraZeneca’s (AZN  -  Free Report) investigational BTK inhibitor, acalabrutinib, was granted priority review by the FDA. The company is looking to get the drug approved for use in patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy. A response from the agency is expected in the first quarter of 2018.

2228,PFE,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Pfizer has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.8. This level compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE ratio for the S&P 500 comes in at about 20.4.If we focus on the long-term trend of the stock the current level puts Pfizer’s current PE above its median over the observed period (which stands at 13.8x). Hence, we could infer that the stock is slightly overvalued in this respect, especially in light of its historical trend.Nevertheless, the stock’s PE compares favorably with its industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 16.5. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now, compared to its peers.PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Pfizer has a P/S ratio of about 4.2. This is lower than the industry average, which comes in at 4.6x right now.PFE is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P/S metric, which suggests that the company’s stock price has already appreciated to some degree, relative to its sales.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Pfizer currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Pfizer an apt choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the company’s P/B ratio (used to compare a stock's market value to its book value) stands at 3.6, lower than the industry average of 5.9. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 10.5, which is far better than the industry average of 15.9. Clearly, PFE is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Pfizer might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of B. This gives PFE a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>).Meanwhile, the company’s earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to four lower, while the full year estimate has seen four upward revisions and one downward revision in the same time period.This has had small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has remained constant over the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched up 0.4%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Pfizer, Inc. Price and Consensus Pfizer, Inc. Price and Consensus | Pfizer, Inc. QuotePfizer has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates that while analysts have some apprehensions about the stock in the immediate future, the stock’s growth story might be good over the long term. Thus, we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LinePfizer is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (Top 17% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. In fact, year to date, the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Notably, Pfizer has been working on strengthening its product portfolio through acquisitions and licensing deals. However, Pfizer continues to face headwinds in the form of genericization of key drugs, lost alliance revenues, pricing pressure and rising competition which is hurting the top-line.Though Pfizer’s growing immuno-oncology portfolio offers strong potential, many of these assets are in early stage of development. Nonetheless, we believe that new products like Ibrance, contribution from acquisitions, cost-cutting efforts and share buybacks should help the company achieve its guidance.Pfizer also boasts a strong pipeline and expects approximately 25 to 30 drug approvals over the next five years, including around 15 products that have blockbuster potential.So, despite a Zacks Rank #3, we believe that bullish analyst sentiment for the long-term and favorable industry factors make this value stock a compelling pick.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

2229,PFE,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) was the first large-cap pharma stock to report its earnings results for this season on Oct 17. J&J beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and revenues in the third quarter and also raised its 2017 sales and profit outlook. Shares of J&J were up more than 3% on Tuesday.J&J’s sales growth accelerated in the third quarter leading the company to post its first positive sales surprise after almost a year. Higher sales in the pharmaceutical segment as well as positive contribution from the Actelion deal pulled up the top line in the quarter. J&J acquired Swiss biotech Actelion in June this year for $30 billion.Overall, the pharma sector has witnessed a great turnaround this year after the drug pricing issue crippled its performance last year.After declining 5.2% last year, the Large Cap Pharma industry has risen 18.2% this year so far, outpacing 14.2% gain for the S&P 500 in the same time frame.New product sales ramp up with rising demand, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results, more frequent FDA approvals (11 new drugs approved in Q3 alone) and continued strong performance of legacy products have played a pivotal role in bringing the sector on track this year.These factors are likely to drive the sector through the rest of this year and probably the next despite challenges like rising competition, pipeline setbacks, slowdown in growth of mature products and generic competition for certain key drugs.J&J’s better-than-expected results, especially the strong performance of its Pharmaceuticals segment, have raised optimism for another strong quarterly performance by the pharma sector, mainly the large-cap companies.Let’s have a closer look at what to expect from six big pharma stocks when they report this month/early next month. Five out of the six companies are expected to deliver earnings beat this quarter.Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report)Pfizer is scheduled to announce third-quarter results on Oct 31 before the market opens. With a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and Earnings ESP of +1.04%, the chances of the stock beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter is high. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.New products like Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis) and Ibrance (breast cancer) as well as older products like Lyrica (neuropathic pain) and Eliquis (blood thinner) are expected to contribute to Pfizer’s top line meaningfully. However, the loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for products like Pristiq Vfend, Zyvox and Celebrex and the expiration of a few co-promotion agreements will continue to hamper top-line growth. Blockbuster drug Enbrel sales will continue to be soft in the quarter due to biosimilar competition.Pfizer surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, as shown in the chart below:Pfizer, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Pfizer, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Pfizer, Inc. QuoteBristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report)Bristol-Myers is scheduled to release results on Oct 26 before the market opens. Similar to Pfizer, our quantitative model indicates an earnings beat for Bristol-Myers. This Zacks Rank #3 stock has an Earnings ESP of +1.05%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Bristol-Myers’ high-profile immuno-oncology drug, Opdivo, is likely to drive the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter. Opdivo’s U.S. sales are driven by the melanoma, second-line non-small-cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma indications.Recent label expansions into the classical Hodgkin lymphoma and head and neck cancer indications will also boost the drug’s sales.Bristol-Myers outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, as reflected in the chart below:Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price and EPS Surprise Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price and EPS Surprise | Bristol-Myers Squibb Company QuoteMerck & Company, Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report)Merck is scheduled to release results on Oct 27 before the market opens. With a Zacks Rank #3 and Earnings ESP of +0.61%, the chances of the stock beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter is high.Merck’s new products like Keytruda (cancer), Zepatier (HCV) and Bridion (sugammadex) Injection will likely drive revenues this quarter as well. Keytruda sales in the United States are gaining, particularly from strong momentum in the new indication of first-line lung cancer. The Keytruda development program significantly advanced in the first half with regulatory approvals for four new indications in the United States and an additional indication in Europe. The new approvals expand the patient population and are expected to drive sales further.However, genericization and increasing competition will likely remain overhangs.Merck outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, as reflected in the chart below:Merck & Company, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Merck & Company, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Merck & Company, Inc. QuoteGlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report)Brentford, UK-based GlaxoSmithKline is expected to report results on Oct 25. GlaxoSmithKline is also expected to outperform in the third quarter due to its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and Earnings ESP of +1.80%.Glaxo’s Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines business segments are expected to perform well. Glaxo’s Pharmaceuticals segment is expected to continue being driven by strong sales of new HIV products, Tivicay and Triumeq.However, many of Glaxo’s key drugs like Lovaza and Avodart are facing declining sales due to generic competition. Moreover, sluggish sales growth in the Consumer Healthcare segment due to a slowdown in market conditions and the impact of divestures may negatively impact the top line in the third quarter.Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, as shown in the chart below:GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price and EPS Surprise GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price and EPS Surprise | GlaxoSmithKline PLC QuoteEli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report)Eli Lillyis slated to announce third-quarter results on Oct 24 before the market opens. With a Zacks Rank #3 and Earnings ESP of +0.07%, the chances of an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter is high.Continuing the trend of the past few quarters, new products like Trulicity, Cyramza, Taltz and Jardiance are likely to support the top line in the reported quarter.However, sluggish performance of Alimta, Cymbalta and Zyprexa are expected to continue in the third quarter due to the loss of exclusivity.Notably, Eli Lilly surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, as shown in the chart below:Eli Lilly and Company Price and EPS Surprise Eli Lilly and Company Price and EPS Surprise | Eli Lilly and Company QuoteNovartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report)Swiss company, Novartis is scheduled to report its results on Oct 24, before market opens. Novartis is not expected to beat estimates in the third quarter due its Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -0.40%.The recent approval of Kymriah for acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a major boost for Novartis, given the potential in the CAR T therapy space. Moreover, new products like Cosentyx and Entresto are expected to boost the top line. Cosentyx has been strong and the company has grabbed market share from rivals like AbbVie’s Humira and Amgen’s Enbrel. Cosentyx achieved blockbuster status in 2016.However, a weak Alcon business and generic competition for several of its key drugs is expected to hurt revenues in this quarter.Notably, Novartis outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, as reflected in the chart below:Novartis AG Price and EPS Surprise Novartis AG Price and EPS Surprise | Novartis AG QuoteThe Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

2230,PFE,"Shares of Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) have declined 24.7% in the last six months compared to the industry’s loss of 20.0%. Here we analyze the factors that led to the underperformance. Mylan is a global pharmaceutical company with a well-established generics business as well as a presence i specialty pharmaceuticals.However, the company continues to face challenges due to volatility and uncertainty in the world's largest pharmaceutical market — the United States due to pressure from both accelerated new approvals on the company’s existing generic products and continued consolidation of the customer base. Contributions from new product launches in the United States were one of the lowest in the second quarter.Sales from EpiPen continue to decline due to increased competition and the impact of the launch of the authorized generic. Recently, Meridian Medical Technologies, a Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) company which manufactures EpiPen Auto-Injector, the EpiPen Jr Auto-Injector and the authorized generic for both the EpiPen Auto-Injector and the EpiPen Jr Auto-Injector received a warning letter from the FDA.Mylan is also exploring the world of biosimilars, a market that has the potential to grow to $20 billion in 2020. A partnership with Biocon, and collaborations with Momenta and Mabion have helped Mylan to develop a wide portfolio of biosimilar/insulin analog generic products, representing a total brand market value of more than $75 billion in worldwide sales. The Biocon partnership includes six biosimilar versions of Herceptin, Neulasta, Humira, Avastin, Enbrel and Neupogen and three insulin analogs (Lantus, Humalog and NovoLog).However, the FDA recently notified Mylan and partner Biocon that the target action date for a biosimilar version of Roche Holdings’ (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Herceptin (trastuzumab) has been extended to Dec 3, 2017. A decision from the FDA was expected by Sep 3 but the FDA extended the period due to review of some of the clarificatory information submitted to the agency as part of the application review process.Meanwhile, the company’s efforts to get Advair’s generic approved suffered a blow when the FDA issued a complete response letter (CRL) to its ANDA for generic Advair Diskus. Advair recorded sales of £1.8 billion in 2016 thereby representing great potential. Although the company did not mention the contents of the CRL such setbacks are likely to weigh on the company’s shares. Moreover, the FDA recently accepted Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Sandoz’s ANDA for Advair. A potential approval will give Sandoz the edge over Mylan.Moreover, the company believes approval delays will persist in 2017 thereby impacting business further.  The company believes that increased competition resulting from the FDA's focus on accelerating the approvals of third, fourth, or fifth generics will impact sales.Hence, we expect the company to face challenging conditions ahead.Zacks RankMylan currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

2231,PFE,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that an FDA advisory committee gave a mixed opinion regarding a regulatory application that was filed to expand the label of its cancer drug Sutent.Sutent is presently marketed for the first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).With the latest supplemental new drug application (sNDA), which was accepted by the FDA in May this year, Pfizer is looking to get the label extended to include use in patients with high-risk of RCC recurrence.The FDA’s Oncologic Drug Advisory Committee (ODAC) voted 6 in favor and 6 against the benefit-risk profile for Sutent for the expanded indication. The FDA is expected to give a response in January 2018.The sNDA in the United States was filed on the basis of aphase III study (S-TRAC) evaluating Sutent as an adjuvant treatment in patients at high risk of recurrent RCC, following nephrectomy (surgical removal of the cancer-containing kidney). Full data presented in October last year showed that Sutent extended disease-free survival (DFS) by more than a year compared to placebo, resulting in an overall risk reduction of 24%.An application for use in the same patient population is also under review in the EU.Sutent generated sales of $529 million in the first half of 2016, down 6% year over year due to competitive pressure in the United States and EU. If approved for the expanded patient population, sales of the drug might improve. It is estimated that 60% of high-risk patients will have RCC recurrence.Pfizer’s shares have underperformed the industry this year so far. The stock has returned 9.1% during this period, comparing unfavorably with an increase of 16.4% for the industry.Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2232,PFE,"Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) announced data from a long-term study on its Alzheimer's disease (AD) candidate, aducanumab. Data from the study showed a continued benefit in the rate of amyloid decline over a two/three year period in patients with prodromal or mild Alzheimer’s disease when treated with aducanumab.Shares were up 2.5% on Monday, in response to the promise shown by the anti-amyloid candidate.The company said the results from a recently conducted analysis of the long-term extension (LTE) of its ongoing phase Ib study (PRIME) of aducanumab were consistent with the previously reported data from PRIME.PRIME is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose phase Ib study being conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of aducanumab in patients suffering from prodromal or mild AD.So far this year, Biogen’s shares have risen 3% while the industry recorded an increase of 7.2%.Biogen is conducting two other phase III studies (ENGAGE and EMERGE) on aducanumab for the treatment of early AD. The results from LTE study support the design of ENGAGE and EMERGE studies.Biogen is looking to strengthen its AD and other neurodegenerative disorders pipeline. Biogen’s AD pipeline comprises candidates with different mechanisms of action including anti-tau candidate (BIIB092/BMS-986168 - with potential in AD as well as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)), anti-amyloid (aducanumab) candidates as well as a BACE inhibitor (elenbecestat) program.However, the successful development of therapies for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease is challenging and we note that several companies have failed in developing treatments for the same. In November last year, Eli Lilly & Company's (LLY  -  Free Report) anti-amyloid candidate solanezumab failed to meet the primary endpoint in a late-stage AD study. Lilly decided to drop the development of solanezumab. Lilly suffered a major setback in Aug 2010, when it had to halt the development of another phase III Alzheimer’s candidate semagacestat.Meanwhile, Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) shelved its late-stage Alzheimer’s candidate, bapineuzumab IV, after it failed two phase III studies. Pfizer was developing the candidate in collaboration with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Elan Corporation.The Alzheimer’s disease market represents a huge commercial potential and a successfully developed product could generate billions of dollars in sales once launched.Biogen has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2233,PFE,"We issued an updated research report on Boulder, CO-based Clovis Oncology, Inc. (CLVS  -  Free Report) on Aug 14.Rubraca has shown impressive growth trend in 2017 on the back of the company’s commercialization efforts. Rubraca sales doubled sequentially in the second quarter. Rubraca sales were $14.6 million in the quarter. However, general and administrative expenses increased 276% year over year to $29.2 million due to commercialization efforts.Rubraca is the only approved drug in the company’s portfolio and is the first and only oral PARP inhibitor to receive approval as monotherapy. The drug is approved for patients who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies, and selected for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for Rubraca.Clovis is conducting two confirmatory studies - ARIEL3 and ARIEL4 – for converting the accelerated approval to continued approval of Rubraca. Rubraca was in-licensed from Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) in 2011.In Jun 2017, the company announced promising progression-free survival (PFS) and safety results from the pivotal maintenance confirmatory study, ARIEL3. The study demonstrated that, Rubraca has a meaningful impact in delaying disease recurrence in advanced ovarian cancer patients. Clovis intends to submit a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for label expansion of Rubraca in the second-line or later maintenance indication for advanced ovarian cancer by October this year. The company believes that the label will increase patient population by at least four times.Meanwhile, the second phase III confirmatory study - ARIEL4 - is evaluating Rubraca versus chemotherapy in patients who have failed two prior lines of therapy.Meanwhile, Rubraca is also under review in the EU for a comparable ovarian cancer indication. An approval is expected in EU in the first quarter of 2018 and Clovis is establishing the commercial infrastructure for the same.Rubraca has immense commercial potential in the target market as there is tremendous demand for PARP inhibitors. Per the American Cancer Society, ovarian cancer ranks fifth in deaths from cancer among women. Over 22,440 cases of ovarian cancer are estimated to be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2017. There is a huge unmet need for new treatment options, given that one in four women with ovarian cancer has a germline or somatic BRCA mutation.Clovis is also developing Rubraca in additional cancer indications either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents, including Tecentriq-Rubraca combination in gynecologic cancers. This combination study is sponsored by Roche. Moreover, the company collaborated with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) in Jul 2017 to evaluate the Rubraca in combination with the latter’s Opdivo in ovarian, breast and prostate cancer.The ovarian cancer market is already crowded with the presence of major players. With the launch of Tesaro, Inc.’s (TSRO  -  Free Report) Zejula in Apr 2017, competition has intensified further.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

2235,PFE,"We issued an updated report on Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (CPRX  -  Free Report) on Sep 15.Catalyst Pharma is a development-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapies targeting rare neurological diseases and disorders such as Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), epilepsy (initially infantile spasms) and Tourette syndrome.At present, this Coral Gables, FL-based company has two candidates under development, Firdapse and CPP-115.Catalyst Pharma’s shares have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has surged 129.6% compared with the industry’s gain of 2.9% in the same time frame.The company expects to report top-line results from its second phase III study of Firdapse for the treatment of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) in the second half of 2017 and resubmit a new drug application (NDA) before the end of 2017. Earlier in 2016, it received a refusal to file letter from the FDA in connection with the NDA for Firdapse.Notably, the agency determined that the company’s NDA was insufficient after a preliminary review. Consequently, Catalyst Pharma was required to conduct additional studies as per the agency’s requirements, in addition to the results of its previously submitted phase III data.In October 2016, it reached an agreement with the FDA under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) for the protocol design, clinical endpoints, and statistical analysis approach to be taken in its second phase III study evaluating Firdapse.Meanwhile, the company is working on developing Firdapse for additional indications. In February 2016, Catalyst initiated an investigator-sponsored phase II/III study on Firdapse for the symptomatic treatment of MuSK-antibody positive MG.  In March 2017, the company reported top-line data from the phase II/III trial.The potential approval of Firdapse, along with its label expansion, will help in generating revenues for the company.Additionally, Catalyst Pharma is exploring the possibility of developing CPP-115 (a GABA aminotransferase inhibitor) for the treatment of epilepsy (initially infantile spasms) and the treatment of other selected neurological indications such as complex partial seizures and Tourette’s disorder.However, the market for epilepsy treatments is highly competitive and crowded given the presence of products like Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Neurontin and Lyrica, Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Topamax, and Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Trileptal.Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

2237,PFE,"GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26 before market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered in-line earnings.Glaxo’s shares are up 10.1% this year so far, underperforming the 11.9% increase witnessed by the Zacks classified Large-Cap Pharma industry.Glaxo’s performance has been pretty good so far, with the company’s earnings beating expectations thrice in the four trailing quarters while meeting estimates in the remaining quarter. Overall, the company has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 12.28%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors to ConsiderAll of its business segments – Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare – are expected to do well in the to-be reported quarter.Glaxo’s Pharmaceuticals segment is expected to be driven by strong sales of new HIV products, Tivicay and Triumeq. Sales of newly launched respiratory drugs, the Ellipta products and Nucala are expected to offset the declines in Seretide, Advair and Avodart. Many of Glaxo’s key drugs like Lovaza and Avodart are facing declining sales due to generic competition. Importantly, pricing dynamics and competitive pressure are hurting sales of its top-selling drug Advair in the US while generic competition is hurting Advair sales in Europe.At the first quarter call, the company had mentioned a lot of uncertainty surrounding the timing of Advair generic launch. However, Mylan N.V.’s (MYL  -  Free Report) efforts to bring a generic version for Advair in the market suffered a blow as the FDA issued a complete response letter to its abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) in Apr 2017, thereby delaying the entry of the generic. Hikma Pharmaceuticals’ generic version of Advair was also denied approval by the FDA in May 2017. A generic version of Advair is therefore not likely to be approved this year.The Vaccines segment will continue to benefit from the uptake of meningitis vaccines, Bexsero and Menveo (acquired from Novartis).Importantly, growth of the Consumer Healthcare segment has slowed down. At the first quarter conference call, management had mentioned that the impact of general sales tax and continued slowdown in the nutrition category in India, challenging economic conditions in some other international markets and the Nigerian beverage business divestment are expected to hurt Consumer Healthcare segment sales this year. These factors might impact second-quarter results.However, cost savings from restructuring and continued efficiencies are likely to boost operating profits.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Glaxo is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is -1.45% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at 68 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 69 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Glaxo’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price and EPS Surprise  GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price and EPS Surprise | GlaxoSmithKline PLC QuoteStock to ConsiderA couple of stocks in the large cap pharmaceuticals sector that also have a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are:Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO  -  Free Report), scheduled to release results on Aug 9, has an Earnings ESP of +7.14% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.54% and a Zacks Rank #3.

2238,PFE,"Horizon Pharma plc (HZNP  -  Free Report) topped both earnings and sales estimate in second-quarter 2017. The company also raised its sales guidance for 2017. The company’s shares moved up 4.72% on better-than-expected second-quarter results and increased guidance.However, Horizon Pharma’s stock is down 17.8% year-to-date against the industry’s gain of 8.8%.The company reported second-quarter 2017 earnings of 26 cents per share which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 12 cents (including stock based compensation expense but excluding one-time items) but were down from 42 cents in the year-ago quarter. Excluding stock based compensation expense, the company reported EPS of 41 cents.Sales in the second quarter were up 12% year over year to $289.5 million fueled by solid growth across its orphan and rheumatology business units. Reported sales also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $235 million.Horizon Pharma PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Horizon Pharma PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Horizon Pharma PLC QuoteQuarter in DetailThe Orphan unit recorded revenues of $120.4 million, up 64% from the year-ago period. The strong performance was backed by solid net sales of Ravicti, which generated sales of $47.2 million in the quarter, up 20% year over year driven by continued conversion from older-generation nitrogen-scavenger therapies, as well as the addition of treatment-naïve patients due to the recent label expansion. On Apr 28, the FDA approved a supplemental New Drug Application for Ravicti to expand the age range for chronic management of urea cycle disorders in patients to two months and older from two years and older.Additionally, Procysbi contributed to the performance with its net sales of $36.7 million. Actimmune sales in the reported quarter were $28.8 million, down 4% year over year.The Rheumatology unit generated sales of $51.7 million, up 56% year over year. Also, Krystexxa sales in the quarter were strong and came in at $38.3 million, up 93% year over year, driven by continued strong year-over-year vial demand.Primary Care garnered revenues of $117.4 million, down 22% year over year. The decline in net sales was due to the implementation of a new contracting model, in order to secure broader inclusion of the company’s primary care medicines on formularies. Net sales of Pennsaid2%, Duexix and Vimovo were $51.2 million, $43.6 million and $21.1 million, respectively, in the reported quarter.2017 GuidanceThe company raised its outlook for 2017 and now expects sales in the range of $1.010–$1.045 billion, compared to the earlier estimate of $985–$1.020 billion.Horizon Pharma is significantly increasing investments in one its key growth drivers, Krystexxa and expects net sales for Krystexxa around $400 million in 2017 driven by higher demand .The guidance includes assumption of lower net average net realized price beginning in the second half primarily resulting from the U.S. Government's Health Resource and Services Administration's Final Rule on 340B drug ceiling price implementation scheduled for Oct 1.  The company expects continued double-digit net sales growth for Ravicti in 2017, with room for additional uptake due to the recent label expansion. The drug is also expected to be launched in Europe in the second half. Sales of Procysbi will decline to the divestiture of European rights. Sales of Actimmune are projected to grow in low single-digits driven by a year-over-year growth in the second half. Other UpdatesDuring the quarter, the company acquired River Vision thereby adding its biologic candidate teprotumumab in late stage development for Thyroid Eye Disease. A confirmatory phase III trial is slated to being by year end. The company expects that annual net sales for teprotumumab in the U.S. could exceed $250 million.In Jun 2017, Horizon Pharma sold the marketing rights for Procysbi and Quinsair in the Europe, the Middle East and Africa regions to Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A. as the company focuses on higher-return businesses.Meanwhile, the company is working on expanding Actimmune’s label. The company has collaborated with the Fox Chase Cancer Center to evaluate Actimmune in combination with a Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo in a phase I dosing study for the treatment of kidney and bladder cancer.  The National Cancer Institute has plans to evaluate Actimmune in combination with Merck & Co (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda to treat cutaneous t-cell lymphoma patients. This phase II study remains on track to begin later this year.Our TakeHorizon Pharma’s second-quarter results were impressive with the company beating on both the top and bottom line estimates. Moreover, the increase in sales guidance for 2017 was encouraging as well. Net sales for rare diseases drug increased 70%. We expect Krystexxa, Ravicti and Actimmune to drive growth in the second half.The acquisition of teprotumumab has further diversified the company’s portfolio. However, key drugs Duexis and Vimovo face competition from Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Celebrex and its generics, and other branded non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cheaper generic versions of NSAID.Zacks RankHorizon Pharma currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2239,PFE,"Total earnings for 83.3% of the total healthcare market capitalization are up 6% on revenue growth of 4.1%. Though earnings growth is weak compared with many other sectors, earnings and revenue beat ratios of 85% and 70%, respectively, are particularly encouraging. In fact, healthcare is the fourth sector that surprised investors the most on earnings, trailing aerospace, technology and materials.Among the most notable players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) was the first major drug company to report earnings on July 18, followed by Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) on July 25 and July 27, respectively. Two other major U.S. drug companies – Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) – reported on July 28 and August 1, respectively. These industry primes posted solid results with earnings beat while a few lagged on the revenue front.Johnson and Johnson Earnings in FocusThe world's biggest maker of healthcare products continued its long streak of earnings beat but narrowly missed the top–line estimate. Earnings per share came in at $1.83, 4 cents ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and 5.2% higher than the year-ago quarter. Revenues grew 1.9% year over year to $18.84 billion but fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.89 billion.Johnson & Johnson raised its full-year earnings per share guidance to $7.12–$7.22 from $7.00–$7.15 and revenue guidance to $75.8–$76.1 billion from $75.4–$76.1 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $7.10 for earnings per share and $75.71 billion for revenues at time of earnings release. JNJ has gained 0.9% to date since its earnings announcement (read: J&J Brightens Outlook: Healthcare ETFs in Focus).Pfizer Earnings in FocusThe U.S. drug giant beat on earnings but missed on revenues. Earnings per share of 67 cents came in couple of cents above the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues of $12.9 billion fell shy of our estimate of $13 billion. On an annual basis, earnings per share rose 5% and revenues declined 2%.For 2017, Pfizer expects revenues in the range of $52-$54 billion and raised the lower end of the earnings per share guidance to $2.54-$2.60 from $2.50–$2.60. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is correctly pegged at $52.79 billion for revenues and $2.56 for earnings per share. Shares of PFE are up 1.8% since the earnings announcement.Merck Earnings in FocusEarnings per share came in at $1.01, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 87 cents and improving 8.6% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues inched up 1% year over year to $9.93 billion and were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.79 billion.Merck raised its revenue guidance from $39.1–$40.3 billion to $39.4-$40.4 billion while reiterated earnings per share projection at $3.76–$3.88 for this year.

The stock has lost 0.3% following its earnings announcement.Bristol-Myers Earnings in FocusBristol-Myers reported earnings per share of 74 cents, a penny ahead of our estimate and increased 7% from the year-ago quarter.

Revenues grew 8% to $5.82 billion and beat our estimate of $5.59 billion.Like other drug makers, Eli Lilly also raised its 2017 revenue and earnings guidance. It now expects revenues in the range of $22.0–$22.5 billion compared with the previous expectation of $21.8–$22.3 billion and earnings per share in the range of $4.10-$4.20 versus $4.05-$4.15 expected previously. The Zacks Consensus Estimate at the time of the earnings release was pegged at $22.18 billion for revenues and $4.12 for earnings per share. Shares of LLY have lost 3.3% since the earnings release.ETF AngleThe string of earnings beat failed to boost pharma ETFs as they saw rough trading over the past 10 days.

2240,PFE,"Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) will report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.73%.Lilly’s shares have risen 17% this year so far while the industry recorded an increase of 18.2%.Lilly’s performance has been mixed with earnings missing expectations in two of the last four quarters while beating the same in the other two, bringing the average negative surprise to 0.89%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors to ConsiderNew products like Trulicity, Taltz and Jardiance have supported the top line in the past few quarters. We expect the trend to continue in the third quarter of 2017 as well. While Trulicity sales are expected to be driven by growth in the GLP-1 market and market share gains, Jardiance sales are likely to be driven by increased market share within the growing SGLT2 class. Newer products like Basaglar, Lartruvo and Taltz may continue to witness better sequential sales backed by strong launch uptake.However, sales of Alimta, Cymbalta and Zyprexa are expected to decline due to the loss of exclusivity. Cymbalta has lost exclusivity in Europe and Canada, Zyprexa in Japan and Alimta in several countries outside the United States. Meanwhile, lower demand in the United States due to competitive pressure mainly from immuno-oncology agents is hurting Alimta sales in the country. The consensus estimate for Alimta for the third quarter is $508 million.Another new drug Olumiant (baricitinib) has been launched in select European countries. In July, the drug was approved in Japan, which is likely to add to the top line in the third quarter. However, in the United States, the drug is under review. In August, Lilly and partner Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) announced that they will re-submit the NDA for baricitinib much faster than previously expected. The NDA is expected to be re-submitted in January next year.Meanwhile, older products like Humulin, Trajenta and Forteo may continue to do well.Animal Health segment sales, in the past two quarters, have been hurt by global competitive pressure. At the Q2 conference call, management had said that the global competitive pressure will continue to hurt revenues in the segment through the rest of the year, though to a lesser extent. The consensus estimate for Animal Health segment for the third quarter is $715 million.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Lilly is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is -0.14%.

2241,PFE,"Shares of Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AERI  -  Free Report) have moved up 15.8% in the last one week on positive news for its lead drug, Rhopressa.In fact, Aerie’s stock has surged 71.4% year to date, compared with the industry’s gain of 3.4%.On Oct 13, the Dermatologic and Ophthalmic Drugs Advisory Committee of the FDA voted in favor of Rhopressa’s approval. The members of the committee unanimously agreed that the trials support the efficacy of netarsudil ophthalmic solution for reducing elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.In addition, majority of the members agreed that the Rhopressa’s efficacy outweigh safety risks.The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act date of Feb 28, 2018. We note that the FDA is not bound by the Advisory Committee’s guidance, but takes its advice into consideration when reviewing drugs.Rhopressa is designed to lower intraocular pressure  (IOP) in patients through novel mechanisms of action ( MOAs). The company believes that Rhopressa represents the first new MOAs for lowering IOP in patients with glaucoma in over 20 years.A potential approval of the drug will significantly boost Aerie’s growth prospects.  However, Rhopressa is expected to face tough competion from established branded and generic drugs like such as Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Simbrinza and Travtan, and Allergan plc’s (AGN  -  Free Report) Lumigan, as well as other smaller biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.Meanwhile, Aerie initiated a phase III study — Mercury 3 in Europe for its other pipeline candidate Roclatan 0.02%/0.005%. Roclatan is a once-daily, quadruple-action fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa and Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xalatan, is being evaluated to lower IOP in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

2242,PFE,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected third-quarter 2017 results, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and sales. The drug and consumer products giant raised its 2017 sales and profit outlook, which sent shares up 1.5% in pre-market trading.In fact, this year so far, J&J’s share price is up 18.1%. This is almost in line with the 18.2% increase witnessed by the industry.Earnings BeatJ&J’s third-quarter 2017 earnings came in at $1.90 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.80 and increasing 13.1% from the year-ago period.Including amortization expense and special items, J&J reported third-quarter earnings of $1.37 per share, down 10.5% from the year-ago period.Sales BeatSales came in at $19.65 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19.28 billion by 1.9%. Sales increased 10.3% from the year-ago quarter, reflecting an operational increase of 9.5% and a positive currency impact of 0.8%. Organically, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, sales increased 3.8% on an operational basis.Third-quarter sales grew 9.7% in the domestic market to $10.29 billion and 10.9% in international markets to $9.36 billion, reflecting 9.3% operational growth and 1.6% positive currency impact.Sales in DetailsPharmaceutical segment sales rose 15.4% year over year to $9.7 billion, reflecting 14.6% operational growth and 0.8% positive currency impact as sales rose in both the domestic and international markets. Sales in the domestic market rose 15.4% to $5.82 billion, while international sales grew 15.5% to $3.88 billion. Organically, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, sales increased 6.7% on an operational basis.New products like Imbruvica (cancer) and Darzalex (multiple myeloma) continued to perform well. Other growth drivers were core products like Xarelto, Stelara and Invega Sustenna. Sales of Concerta and Zytiga improved in the quarter.In the quarter, J&J recorded pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) revenues of $670 million. The $30 billion acquisition of Swiss biotech Actelion in June diversified J&J’s revenues to the PAH category.However, sales of Invokana/Invokamet declined 19.2% due to higher managed care discounting. Importantly, sales of the blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade, marketed in partnership with Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report), declined 7.6% in the quarter with U.S. sales declining 1.3% and international sales declining 6.9% due to biosimilar competition. In this regard, we would like to mention that Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) filed a lawsuit in a U.S. district court recently. In the lawsuit, Pfizer alleged J&J of resorting to unfair practices to prevent sale of Inflectra — Pfizer’s biosimilar version of Remicade — that was launched in the United States in November last year.J&J’s Pharma segment achieved some clinical milestones during the quarter including label expansions in the United States for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) drug, Tracleer for pediatric use and Imbruvica for chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) – the drug’s first indication outside of cancer. J&J markets Imbruvica in partnership with AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report).At the call, the company also mentioned that it will not file global regulatory applications for rheumatoid arthritis candidate, sirukumab. We remind investors that last month, J&J received a complete response letter (CRL) from the FDA for sirukumab for want of additional safety data.  Medical Devices segment sales came in at $6.6 billion, up 7.1% from the year-ago period. It included an operational increase of 6.6% and positive currency movement of 0.5%. Sales gained mainly from the inclusion of Abbott Medical Optics acquisition, which added 5.2% to operational sales growth. Excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures, on an operational basis, worldwide sales increased 1.2%.Domestic market sales rose 4.6% year over year to $3.19 billion. International market sales increased 9.6% (operational increase of 8.6%) year over year to $3.41 billion.Operational growth was driven by wound closure products in the General Surgery business, electrophysiology products in the Cardiovascular business and Acuvue contact lenses in the Vision Care business, which made up for a weaker sales performance in the Diabetes Care unitThe Consumer segment recorded revenues of $3.36 billion in the reported quarter, up 2.9% year over year(operational increase of 1.6%). Foreign currency movement positively impacted sales in the segment by 1.3%. Sales in the domestic market declined 0.5% from the year-ago period to $1.29 billion.Slower growth in baby care products due to competitive pressure was partially offset by growth in beauty and over-the-counter products and international smoking cessation aids.Meanwhile, the international segment recorded an increase of 5.1% to $2.07 billion, reflecting an operational increase of 3% and a positive currency impact of 2.1%.2017 Guidance RaisedJ&J raised its adjusted earnings and sales outlook for the year.J&J expects 2017 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $7.25 - $7.30 compared with $7.12 - $7.22 expected previously.The revenue guidance was raised to a range of $76.1 billion to $76.5 billion compared with $75.8 billion to $76.1 billion expected previouslyOur TakeAs indicated last quarter, J&J’s sales growth accelerated in the third quarter leading the company to post its first positive sales surprise after almost a year. Higher sales in the pharmaceutical segment as well as positive contribution from the Actelion deal pulled up the top line in the quarter. The Actelion acquisition added an impressive 7.9% to operational sales growth in the quarter.Though quite a few key products in J&J’s portfolio like Remicade and Concerta are facing generic competition, we believe that new products in all segments, label expansion of drugs like Imbruvica and Darzalex and contribution from Actelion could lead to better sales trends, going forward.J&J carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2243,PFE,"Cancer, capable of striking fear in even the strongest of hearts, is a malignancy characterized by uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells, which, if not treated, can lead to death. According to the American Cancer Society, there are more than 100 types of cancers, the deadliest among them being breast cancer, skin cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, and blood cancer.Presentations at the European Society for Medical Oncology (""ESMO"") 2017 Congress held between Sep 8 and 12 in Madrid, Spain dominated headlines in the cancer space this week. Major presentations included Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) and AstraZeneca, plc's (AZN  -  Free Report) positive results from ongoing phase III study in melanoma and lung cancer patients, respectively, and Pfizer, Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) disappointing data for its lung cancer candidate.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesAstraZeneca’s Imfinzi Positive in Phase III Lung Cancer Study: AstraZeneca announced promising lung cancer data from a late stage study on its new cancer drug, Imfinzi. Interim data from the phase III study – PACIFIC – demonstrated that Imfinzi achieved an improvement of 11 months in  progression-free survival over standard of care in patients with locally advanced, unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not progressed following chemoradiation. Data from a separate phase III FLAURA study on another lung cancer drug, Tagrisso, showed that the drug reduced the risk of progression or death by more than half compared with other commonly-used EGFR inhibitors. (Read more: AstraZeneca's Lung Cancer Study Data Promising)Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo Superior to Yervoy in Melanoma Patients: Bristol-Myers announced data from a phase III study, CheckMate -238, comparing Opdivo to Yervoy for treating patients with stage IIIb/c or stage IV melanoma who have undergone complete resection. Interim data from the study showed that Opdivo is superior to Yervoy. Opdivo achieved a statistically significant improvement of 35% in recurrence-free survival compared to Yervoy. (Read more: Bristol-Myers Reports Positive Results from Melanoma Study)Pfizer’s Xalkori Fails Lung Cancer Study/Xtandi Positive in Prostate Cancer Study: Pfizer’s ongoing phase III study (PROFILE 1014), evaluating Xalkori for the first-line treatment of ALK-positive NSCLC, did not meet its secondary endpoint of significant improvement in overall survival (OS) rates. After a median follow-up of 46 months, the median OS for patients treated with Xalkori was 45.8 months while it was 47.5 months for patients randomized to chemotherapy. However, Pfizer’s prostate cancer candidate, Xtandi achieved a statistically significant improvement in metastasis-free survival. The drug is being evaluated in combination with androgen deprivation therapy in a phase III study (PROSPER) for a potential label expansion to include early stage prostate cancer patients.(Read more: Pfizer Lung Cancer Drug's Overall Survival Data Unfavorable)Disappointing Week for Roche: The FDA accepted Sandoz’s, the generics arm of Novartis, biologics license application for a biosimilar version of Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) leukemia treatment Rituxan (rituximab). Novartis has received approval for Rituxan’s biosimilar in Europe in June 2017. Rituxan had recorded sales of almost $3.9 billion in the first half of 2017. In another setback, the FDA approved Amgen/Allergan’s biosimilar version of another key drug, Avastin, for treating multiple cancer indications including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma and cervix cancer. The biosimilar will be marketed by the trade name of Mvasi. (Read more: Novartis' BLA for Biosimilar of Rituxan Accepted by the FDA)Other UpdatesApart from the abovementioned news, there were a few other updates in the cancer space. The FDA accepted two New Drug Applications (NDAs) of Array BioPharma seeking approval for the combination of binimetinib and encorafenib to treat patients with BRAF-mutant advanced, unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The regulatory body also accepted a supplemental NDA for Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.’s (TEVA  -  Free Report) Trisenox seeking label expansion of the drug to include treatment naïve acute promyelocytic leukemia patients. Nektar Therapeutics announced the initiation of dosing in a phase I/II study, which evaluates the efficacy and safety of its lead immuno-oncology candidate, NKTR-214, in combination with Roche's Tecentriq and Merck's (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2244,PFE,"Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc. (MNTA  -  Free Report) reported a loss of 50 cents per share in the second quarter of 2017, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The reported loss was, however, wider than the year-ago loss of 31 cents.Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. QuoteRevenues in the quarter improved 10.8% to $23.6 million and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.9 million.Momenta’s stock has rallied 6.3% year to date compared with the industry’s rally of 9.9%. Quarter in DetailMomenta’s top line comprises product revenues of $19.1 million earned from Sandoz’s sales of Glatopa, a generic version of Copaxone (20 mg), compared with $20.7 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales deductions in the second quarter of 2016, as well as legal reimbursement in the second quarter of 2017.Collaborative research and development revenues came in at $4.4 million, down from $5.8 million in the year-ago quarter. The decline in revenues was mainly due to the termination of the Baxalta Collaboration Agreement, effective Dec 31, 2016.While, research and development expenses were up to $39.1 million from $33.2 million, general and administrative expenses increased 52% to $22.6 million.Outlook UpdatedMomenta now expects operating expenses (excluding stock-based compensation and net of collaborative revenues) in the range of $210–$230 million, compared with the previous guidance of $200–$240 million in 2017. The guidance also includes approximately $55 million of capital expenditure on M923. Operating expenses in the third quarter of 2017 are projected around $50–$60 million.Momenta expect to generate revenues of $45 million from Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) as upfront payment on a quarterly basis. In Jul 2017, Momenta earned a $10 million milestone payment from Sandoz as Glatopa 20 mg continues to be the sole FDA-approved generic of Copaxone 20 mg.Pipeline UpdateSandoz’s abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) for the 40-mg thrice-weekly formulation of Copaxone (Glatopa 40mg) was under the FDA review. However, Momenta suffered a setback with the FDA issuing a warning letter to Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) in Feb 2017, which is Sandoz’s contracted fill/finish manufacturing partner for Glatopa.Pfizer has submitted a comprehensive response to the observations cited in the warning letter. The ANDA approval is now contingent on the satisfactory resolution of the compliance observations stated in the warning letter issued to Pfizer.Meanwhile, Momenta continues to progress with its other pipeline candidates. Currently, Momenta’s M923, a biosimilar version of AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira, is being evaluated in a phase III study in patients suffering from moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Moving ahead, the company plans to submit the candidate for approval to regulatory bodies in the fourth quarter of 2017. Also, it expects first commercial launch of M923 to be as early as the 2020 timeframe.The company completed enrolment in the phase I study on M834, a biosimilar version of Orencia (abatacept) in Apr 2017 under its collaboration with Mylan. Top-line data from the study are expected in the second half of 2017.Furthermore, Momenta’s novel autoimmune portfolio includes: M230, a Selective Immunomodulator of Fc receptors (SIF3) and M281, an anti-FcRn monoclonal antibody. In Jan 2017, the company entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with CSL for M230 and potential future Fc multimer programs. The candidate is expected to enter clinic in 2017.Momenta successfully completed a phase I single ascending dose study in healthy volunteers for M281. The multiple ascending dose portion of the study was initiated in Jan 2017 (expected to be completed in Aug 2017) and data from the single and multiple ascending dose portions of the study are projected in the second half of 2017.Our TakeMomenta’s loss per share came in line with estimates in the second quarter of 2017 while sales beat estimates. The ANDA approval for Glatopa is contingent on the satisfactory resolution of the compliance observations stated in the warning letter issued by the FDA, resulting in a delay of approval. We expect the warning letter will remain a drag on the company's shares till the issue is solved.Nevertheless, sales of Glatopa 20mg continue to do well. Glatopa 20mg has captured approximately 40% of the market in the U.S. In addition, a potential approval of M923 will boost investor confidence.Zacks RankMomenta currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2245,PFE,"Janssen, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), announced that the FDA has approved the label expansion of its plaque psoriasis drug, Stelara for use in adolescents (12 years of age or older). The drug is approved for adults in this indication since 2009.The company believes that the label expansion is a significant achievement as plaque psoriasis develops before the age of 20 years in approximately one-third of the patients. Moreover, the number of treatments available for adolescents is limited.Patients are administered only four doses a year after two starter doses of Stelara, which has become a leading therapeutic option.Shares of the company are up 18.4% so far this year, almost in line with the industry’s performance. The industry has gained 18.3% in the same time frame.The latest approval for Stelara is based on data from a phase III study, which evaluated the subcutaneous administration of the drug in adolescent patients. The data showed that the drug achieved minimal psoriasis or clear skin in at least two-thirds of the patients. The safety data was also consistent with what was achieved in adult patients.There are almost 7.5 million people suffering from psoriasis in the United States per the American Academy of Dermatology. Moreover, the National Center for Biotechnology Information stated that the majority of psoriasis patients suffer from plaque psoriasis. The numbers represent a huge opportunity for the drug following its label expansion..Moreover, with this approval Stelara has gained an edge over competing drugs like AbbVie Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira, Novartis AG’s Cosentyx and Celgene Corporation’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Otezla, which are only approved for adult plaque psoriasis patients. However, Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Enbrel will compete with Stelara in the adolescent segment.Johnson & Johnson Price and Consensus  Johnson & Johnson Price and Consensus | Johnson & Johnson QuoteJohnson & Johnson carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Price and EPS Surprise Universal Health Services, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Universal Health Services, Inc. QuoteUniversal Health’s efforts to enhance shareholders’ value through share repurchases might have boosted its bottom-line by limiting share count.Nevertheless increasing costs related to interest payment, reserves for settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits, and impairments of long-lived assets might have put pressure on margins.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Universal Health is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Universal Health carries a Zacks Rank #3.

2247,PFE,"The Dow breached the psychological 22,000 barrier during a week of strong gains. Strong earnings performances were primarily responsible for the index’s record run. The index also received a boost from falling sovereign bond yields on Monday. On Tuesday, the index achieved its 31st record finish for the year.Ultimately, the index breached the 22,000 barrier on Wednesday. The index gained again on Thursday despite suffering minor losses earlier in the session after the Russia investigation led by Robert Mueller intensified.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow gained 0.2% on Friday to close at a record level. The blue-chip index was boosted by splendid earnings from Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report). This enabled the Dow to recover from the 40 point decline it suffered earlier in the session. On the other hand, Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) posted a dismal earnings performance, losing 1.5%. Amazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) disappointing second quarter results weighed on other benchmarks.The index gained 1.2% over last week. The Dow’s great run was supported by excellent earnings for the week. Index components which reported better-than-expected earnings during this period are McDonald's Corp. MCD, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) and Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report)The Dow This WeekThe index gained  0.3% on Monday to finish at yet another all-time high, buoyed by a rally in shares of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report), The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) and Boeing. Falling sovereign bond yields also helped the index touch a record level during this trading session. Over last month, the Dow gained 2.5%, powered by the excellent earnings results released during this period.  On Tuesday, the index increased by 0.3% once again. The Dow registered yet another record high on Tuesday, stopping just short of attaining the psychological milestone of 22,000. This was its 31st record close that the blue-chip index breached this year.This marked the Dow’s sixth straight session of gains and second straight record finish. 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) and Goldman Sachs contributed to most of its gains on this occasion. Rising bank shares and splendid earnings from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) have also been instrumental for Dow’s stellar showing.Ultimately, the index breached the 22,000 barrier on Wednesday. The index gained 0.2%, marking its seventh consecutive daily increase. This historic benchmark was achieved within 107 trading days of Dow hitting the 21,000 mark.This stellar showing was a result of a surge in the shares of Apple Inc.

The index closed above the 22,000 threshold yet again on a day marked by losses for other benchmarks. Further, the blue-chip index notched its eighth straight daily rise, buoyed by an increase in shares of Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report). Early in the session, the blue-chip index had suffered minor losses after the Russia investigation led by Robert Mueller intensified.Components Moving the Index Apple reported spectacular results for third-quarter fiscal 2017, driven by the impressive Service segment performance. Earnings of $1.67 per share and revenues of $45.4 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.57 and $44.7 billion, respectively. On a year-over-year basis, earnings grew 17.6% and revenues increased 7.2%. Apple has a Zacks Rank #3.Total iPhone unit sales came in at about 41 million, up 2% year over year.

2248,PFE,"The biotech industry has witnessed a great turnaround this year after the drug pricing issue crippled its performance last year. After declining 5.2% last year, the Large Cap Pharma industry has risen 18.9% so far this year, outpacing 14% gain for the S&P 500 in the same time frame.The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index is up almost 28% year to date after sliding 19.1% in 2016. The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index has risen 15.4% year to date (YTD) after declining almost 10% last year.The pharma/biotech sector has a number of things going in its favor. Strong quarterly results, new product sales ramp up with rising demand, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results, more frequent FDA approvals (11 new drugs approved in Q3 alone) and continued strong performance from legacy products have played a pivotal role in bringing the sector on track this year. Another factor that has contributed to the sector’s surge is that President Trump's expected action on drug prices may not be as onerous as previously feared.These factors are likely to drive the sector through the rest of this year and probably the next despite challenges like rising competition, pipeline setbacks, slowdown in growth of mature products and generic competition for certain key drugs.On the broader macro front, the proposed tax reforms, if approved, will leave more cash in the hands of these companies. The cash can be invested for mergers/acquisitions, which have been relatively fewer this year compared with the last.Meanwhile, the outlook for the upcoming third quarter results looks bright. Per the Earnings Trends article, the broader Medical sector (includes drug, biotech as well as Medical Device companies) is expected to record year-over-year growth of 4.7% in revenues and 0.8% in earnings in Q3.How to Pick Likely Q3 WinnersGiven the enormity of the healthcare space, selecting stocks that have the potential to beat estimates could appear to be quite daunting. But our proprietary methodology makes it fairly simple. One way to narrow down the list of choices this earnings season is by looking at stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – and a positive Earnings ESP. More often than not, a positive earnings surprise delivered by a company leads to stock price appreciation.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of delivering a positive surprise in their upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Here are five large-cap pharma stocks that are poised to beat estimates in the third quarter according to our methodology. Investing in stocks with large market cap is a much more reliable investment because of the fact that they control a large portion of their given industry. Also companies with a larger market cap have performed well throughout 2017.Our first pick is Eli Lilly & Company (LLY  -  Free Report). This Indianapolis, IN based company has an Earnings ESP of +1.59% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is $1.03 per share.

2249,PFE,"Spin-off activities have stepped up lately, with biggies like Honeywell International (HON  -  Free Report) and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) being the most active ones. Lately, the industrial giant Honeywell announced plans of spinning off its homes and global distribution units and its transportation systems unit into two publicly traded companies by 2018 end (read: 5 ETFs to Buy on 13-Year High Manufacturing Activity).On the other hand, Pfizer is exploring strategic alternatives to possibly bid good-bye to its Consumer Healthcare segment. A sale or spin-off of its consumer-health unit is expected next year. Pfizer's consumer sales have been essentially “flat for the past three years.”This clearly explains why Pfizer intends to concentrate on the more promising, innovative pharmaceutical unit and separate it from Consumer Healthcare. The move also signifies the likely introduction of more deal-making, as per Wall Street Journal. However, the company also kept open chances of retaining the business.Inside Spin-offsSometimes businesses form another autonomous entity from an existing business/division, when they believe that the separated line would add more value as an independent company. In such situations, the parent can focus on its core business management while the new entity can focus on its relative different goals.How Profitable Spin-offs are to Investors?According to Cantor Fitzgerald, “spinoffs completed between 2009 and 2013 outperformed the S&P 500 in their first year of trading by an average of more than 17 percent.” As per an article published on benzinga, spun-off entities have been performing better than parent companies lately.PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report) (up about 114%) generated higher gains than parent eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) (up about 56%) in the last two years (post spin-off). WhiteWave Foods Co  gained about 67.8% in the last three years against an 11.2% decline in Dean Foods Co (DF  -  Free Report). WhiteWave Foods was spun off in May 2013. Abbot Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) cut ties with part of its business and formed a new company called AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) in Jan 2013. ABBV was up 85% while ABT gained 41% in the last three years (as of Oct 12, 2017).What’s Behind the Recent Surge in Spin-OffA Chicago-based partner at The Boston Consulting Group recently commented that in a bull market, which we are witnessing currently, equities are overvalued. This makes materialization of mergers and acquisitions difficult. Instead, high valuations better justify “spinning off assets or divesting assets."" If this logic holds good, we are likely to see more such actions in the coming days (read: 4 Bargain ETFs in a Pricey Market).Notably, the United States saw 88 completed spinoffs in 1999, which fell to 80 in 2000, when the dot-com bubble burst. The number further declined to 55 in 2001. The number of actions again rose from 24 in 2007 to 30 in 2008, before sliding to 17 in 2009 when the financial crisis kicked in, as per the data provided by Dealogic, quoted on CNBC. The momentum again gained momentum in 2015 by value, though 2016 and 2017 have been subdued.ETFs to Play There are always ways to play such corporate actions. Below we highlight two spin-off ETFs in detail. These ETFs can get further boost from Honeywell and Pfizer’s announcements.Guggenheim S&P Spin-Off ETF (CSD  -  Free Report)The 61-stock fund looks to track the S&P U.S. Spin-Off Index. Paypal Holdings (7.98%), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (7.85%) and Synchrony Financial (7.39%) are the top three holdings of the fund. CSD charges 65 bps in fees (read: PayPal's Strong Q2 Results Put These ETFs in Focus).VanEck Vectors Global Spin-Off ETF (SPUN  -  Free Report) The 95-stock fund follows the Horizon Kinetics Global Spin-Off Index, which is a rules-based, equal-weighted index intended to track the performance of listed, publicly held spin-offs that are domiciled and trade in the U.S. or developed markets of Western Europe and Asia. The net expense ratio of the fund is 0.55%. United States accounts for about 78.8% of the fund. Gannett Co (1.2%), Time Inc. (1.1%) and Timkensteel (1.1%) are top three stocks of the fund.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

2250,PFE,"AstraZeneca, plc (AZN  -  Free Report) announced that Faslodex has received FDA approval for a label extension in the first-line monotherapy setting for the treatment of advanced breast cancer.Faslodex has  been approved as a monotherapy treatment for previously untreated post-menopausal women with hormone-receptor positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer.So far this year, AstraZeneca’s shares have moved up 7%, comparing unfavorably to a 10.8% increase for the industry.Coming back to the latest news, the FDA approval was based on data from the phase III FALCON study. The FALCON study evaluated the anti-tumor effects and tolerability profile of Faslodex (500 mg) plus placebo in comparison to anastrozole (1 mg) plus placebo.Data from the study showed that treatment with Faslodex led to 20% reduction in disease progression or death versus anastrozole, the current standard of care treatment.We note that Faslodex is currently approved in the United States for the treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen-receptor (ER)-positive locally-advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose cancer has progressed following anti-estrogen therapy. The drug is also approved in the United States in combination with Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Ibrance (palbociclib), for the treatment of HR+, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-) advanced or metastatic breast cancer in women whose cancer has progressed after endocrine therapy.We remind investors that Faslodex was approved in the same first-line indication in the EU in July and in Japan in June.The latest approval in the first-line setting is expected to improve the sales of the drug.In the first half of 2017, Faslodex generated sales of $462 million, up 15% year over year.AstraZeneca currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked pharma/biotech stocks are Gilead Sciences, Inc.

2251,PFE,"Shares of Clovis Oncology, Inc. (CLVS  -  Free Report) have witnessed a continuous upside this year. Shares of this small biotech company are up 62.3% so far this year, outperforming the 7.2% increase registered by the industry during this period. Let’s analyze the factors that have driven the rally so far.The company’s only approved drug, Rubraca, has shown an impressive growth trend in 2017. The drug received accelerated approval in Dec 2016. The company’s commercialization efforts have helped the ovarian cancer drug register almost 100% growth in sales sequentially in the second quarter of 2017. Rubraca sales were $21.7 million in the first half of 2017. The company had 1100 new patients on therapy in the period.Rubraca is a PARP inhibitor, which is approved as a monotherapy for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in patients who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies. The patients are selected for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for Rubraca. The drug was in-licensed from Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) in 2011.Two confirmatory studies - ARIEL3 and ARIEL4 – are being conducted by Clovis for converting the accelerated approval to continued approval of Rubraca.The company’s shares got a boost when it announced positive top-line results from ARIEL 3 in June 2017. Promising progression-free survival (PFS) and safety results from the pivotal maintenance confirmatory study demonstrated that Rubraca had a meaningful impact in delaying disease recurrence in advanced ovarian cancer patients.Clovis is planning to file a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) to the FDA by October this year based on ARIEL-3 data to include second-line or later maintenance indication for advanced ovarian cancer on the label of Rubraca. The company expects the label expansion to increase patient population by at least four times.Meanwhile, the other phase III confirmatory study -- ARIEL4 -- is evaluating Rubraca versus chemotherapy in patients who have failed two prior lines of therapy. Rubraca is also under review in the EU for a comparable ovarian cancer indication. An approval is expected in EU in the first quarter of 2018 and Clovis is establishing the commercial infrastructure for the same.There is immense commercial potential for Rubraca in the target market due to increasing demand for PARP inhibitors. Per the American Cancer Society, ovarian cancer ranks fifth in deaths from cancer among women. Over 22,440 cases of ovarian cancer are estimated to be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2017. There is a huge unmet need for new treatment options, given that one in four women with ovarian cancer has a germline or somatic BRCA mutation.Rubraca is also being developed in additional cancer indications either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents, including Tecentriq-Rubraca combination in gynecologic cancers. This combination study is sponsored by Roche. Moreover, in Jul 2017 the company collaborated with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) to evaluate Rubraca in combination with the latter’s Opdivo in ovarian, breast and prostate cancer.It is important to note that the ovarian cancer market is already crowded with the presence of major players. With the launch of Tesaro, Inc.’s (TSRO  -  Free Report) Zejula in Apr 2017, competition has intensified further.Clovis Oncology, Inc. Price and Consensus  Clovis Oncology, Inc.

2252,PFE,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) and six international cancer research groups are collaborating on a combination study to explore the use of Ibrance for first-line treatment of advanced breast cancer.The PATINA phase III study will evaluate Ibrance, a CDK 4/6 inhibitor, in combination with anti-HER2 therapy and endocrine therapy versus standard therapy for the first-line treatment of HR+, HER2+ metastatic breast cancer. The first patient in the study was randomized last month.  About 500 patients are expected to be recruited worldwide in the study.Ibrance is presently marketed for the treatment of HR+, HER2- disease in combination with an aromatase inhibitor as initial endocrine-based therapy in postmenopausal women, or AstraZeneca plc’s (AZN  -  Free Report) Faslodex (fulvestrant) in women whose disease has progressed following endocrine therapy. The drug is presently not approved for use in the HR+, HER2+ patient population.Pfizer’s shares have underperformed the industry this year so far. Pfizer’s shares are up 5.1% during this period comparing unfavorably with an increase of 6.4% for the industry.Ibrance plays an instrumental role in driving Pfizer’s revenues. The drug recorded sales of $1.53 billion in the first half of 2017, up 63% year over year.  Pfizer is also exploring the possibility of expanding the label of its breast cancer drug, Ibrance, into recurrent and subsequent early breast cancer as well as several non-breast cancer indications like pancreatic and head and neck cancers.Meanwhile, Pfizer boasts a strong oncology pipeline. Its key cancer candidate, Bavencio/avelumab got FDA approval for metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in Mar 2017 and for advanced bladder cancer in May. Bavencio is under review in the EU for MCC with a decision expected in the third quarter of 2017. Bavencio is being touted as a significant top-line driver for this New York-based pharma giant. Another cancer drug, Besponsa (inotuzumab ozogamicin) received FDA approval earlier this month as a monotherapy for the treatment of relapsed or refractory CD22-positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The drug was approved in the EU last month.Meanwhile, other cancer candidates include talazoparib (advanced breast cancer) and dacomitinib (advanced lung cancer with EGFR activating mutations).At the Q1 conference call, Pfizer had mentioned that approximately 25 to 30 drug approvals are expected over the next five years, including around 15 products that have blockbuster potential.Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2254,PFE,"The blue-chip index registered its 33rd record for 2017 to finish above the 22,000 threshold yet again on a day marked by losses for other benchmarks. Further, the Dow notched its eighth straight daily rise, buoyed by an increase in shares of Pfizer. The S&P 500 ended in the red after the energy sector slumped due to a steep fall in the shares of Concho Resources and Apache Corp. Nasdaq continued its lackluster performance as it ended in the red again and this has primarily been due to the tech overvaluation issue. Moreover, the broader markets incurred losses as the Russia investigation led by Robert Mueller intensified.

Eight of the eleven major industry sectors closed in the red with the energy sector leading the decliners.

2267,PFE,"Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted a tentative approval to Lusduna Nexvue, the company’s biosimilar version of Sanofi’s (SNY  -  Free Report) Lantus (insulin glargine) for treatment of people with type I and type II diabetes. Lusduna Nexvue delivers insulin in a pre-filled dosing device.Note that the candidate was formerly known as MK-1293. The FDA has granted a provisional approval to its trade name Lusduna Nexvue, to be used once the product is made available in the U.S.Merck’s shares have underperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has gained 6.9% compared with the broader industry’s increase of 13.2%.Though Lusduna met all the regulatory safety and efficacy standards, the approval is tentative due to an ongoing litigation with Sanofi. The final approval of Lusduna is subject to a resolution of the Sanofi litigation.In September last year, Sanofi sued Merck for patent infringement on Lantus. The litigation automatically invoked a stay on the final FDA approval of Lusduna for up to 30 months, or in the event, a court rules in favor of Merck, whichever is sooner. Notably, Lantus has been a major contributor to the Sanofi’s top line having accounted for 14.1% of the total sales in 2016.However, the company considers the conditional approval as a significant milestone as it is advancing the candidate another step closer to the market.We remind investors that Merck is developing Lusduna in collaboration with Samsung Bioepis. Under the agreement terms, Merck is responsible for clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization, while Bioepis is partially funding the development.Currently, an application for regulatory approval of Lusduna for treatment of patients with type I and type II diabetes is under review in the EU.We remind investors that Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) is already marketing a “follow-on” insulin glargine product, Basalgar, since Dec 2016.In a separate press release, Merck announced a collaboration with Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) modernization of pharmaceutical packaging with the introduction of corning valor glass that enhances the storage and delivery of drug formulations.Merck & Company, Inc.

2268,PFE,"Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report), a well-known name in the multiple sclerosis (MS) market, will report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 25, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.63%.Biogen’s shares have declined 0.4% this year so far while the Zacks classified Biomed-Genetics industry recorded an increase of 8.8%.Biogen’s earnings performance has been pretty impressive so far, having delivered back-to-back positive surprises. The average earnings beat over the last four quarters is 5.29%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderAt the first quarter call, the company had said that it expects relatively stable demand for both Tecfidera and Tysabri (its multiple sclerosis drugs) in 2017 as patient growth in ex-U.S. markets offsets the modest decline in the U.S. due to rising competition from drugs like Roche’s Ocrevus. It remains to be seen whether its second-quarter performance reflects the trend.Meanwhile, the combined number of patients using Avonex and Plegridy is on the decline as patients transition to other oral multiple sclerosis therapies or other high-efficacy products.Zinbryta, launched in collaboration with AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) in Aug 2016, is expected to continue to contribute to revenues in the U.S. and the EU. The drug benefits from increased use of high-efficacy products.Spinraza approved for spinal muscular atrophy in Dec 2016 was off to a promising start backed by robust underlying demand Notably, Spinraza, which added $47.4 million to the top line in the first quarter of 2017, should contribute further to sales. At the Q1 conference call, the company had said that it is working on expanding access to Spinraza to all patients.However, at the call, the company had warned of possible logistics and coverage restriction on the drug in the U.S. as well as other markets. We expect management to provide an update on the issue at its second quarter conference call.Biogen’s biosimilar products - Flixabi (a biosimilar referencing Remicade) and Benepali (a biosimilar referencing Enbrel) are also generating higher revenues. The trend should continue this quarter as well.Headcount reduction and restructuring initiatives are expected to continue to lower operating expenses.

2269,PFE,"We expect Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 25, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.08%.So far this year, Lilly’s share price has risen 13.8% compared with an increase of 11.9% for the Zacks classified Large-Cap Pharma industry.Lilly’s earnings performance has been mixed with earnings missing expectations in two of the last four quarters, while beating in the other two, bringing the average negative surprise to 2.28%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors at PlayContinuing the trend of the past few quarters, new products like Trulicity, Cyramza, Taltz and Jardiance are likely to support the top line in the second quarter. While Trulicity sales are being driven by growth in the GLP-1 market and market share gains, Jardiance sales should continue to be driven by increased market share within the growing SGLT2 class.In Dec 2016, the FDA approved Jardiance for the CV indication (launched in Jan 2017) while the American Diabetes Association (ADA) updated its diabetes treatment guidelines. At the first quarter call, management had said that since the launch of the CV indication and ADA’s addition of Jardiance to its treatment guidelines, Jardiance new-to-therapy volume has increased by 75%. This is expected to translate into higher sales.However, sales of Alimta, Cymbalta and Zyprexa are expected to continue to decline due to the loss of exclusivity. Cymbalta has lost exclusivity in Europe and Canada, Zyprexa in Japan and Alimta in several countries outside U.S. Also, lower demand in the U.S. due to competitive pressure mainly from immuno-oncology agents is hurting Alimta’s U.S. sales.Nevertheless, older products like Humalog, Trajenta and Forteo should continue to do well.Newly launched drugs like Basaglar and Lartruvo should add to the top line. Basaglar - Lilly and partner Boehringer Ingelheim’s follow-on insulin to Sanofi’s (SNY  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug, Lantus - was launched in the U.S. in mid-Dec 2016. Lartruvo (olaratumab) was launched in the U.S. and the EU for soft tissue sarcoma in the fourth quarter of 2016. Both the new drugs are expected to generate decent revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.Another new drug, Olumiant has been launched in select European countries and should add to the top line in the second quarter. The drug is under review in the U.S.  In Apr 2017, Lilly received a complete response letter (CRL) from the FDA for baricitinib. The FDA requires additional clinical data, which will delay the approval of the drug. An update on the same is expected on the conference call.Animal Health segment sales suffered last quarter due to global competitive pressure. It remains to be seen if trends improve this quarter.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model shows that Lilly is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate ($1.04 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($1.03 per share), is +0.97%. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Lilly has a Zacks Rank #2. The combination of Lilly’s favorable Zacks Rank #2 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Eli Lilly and Company Price and EPS Surprise  Eli Lilly and Company Price and EPS Surprise | Eli Lilly and Company QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderA couple of stocks in the large cap pharmaceuticals sector that also have a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are:Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO  -  Free Report), scheduled to release results on Aug 9, has an Earnings ESP of +7.14% and a Zacks Rank #3.

2270,PFE,"AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release second-quarter 2017 earnings, before the opening bell on Jul 28.AbbVie’s shares have rallied 18.2% so far this year, while the industry has recorded an increase of 13.2%.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 1.59%. We note that AbbVie’s earnings history is a mixed bag as the pharmaceuticals company delivered positive surprises in the two of the last four quarters but recorded in-line earnings in the other two. The average earnings beat for the last four quarters is 1.65%.AbbVie Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAbbVie Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | AbbVie Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Factors to ConsiderAt the first-quarter 2017 conference call, management revealed that it expects second-quarter 2017 earnings in the range of $1.39–$1.41 per share. Revenues are expected to grow between 7% and 8% on a reported basis. Currency headwinds are expected to hurt revenues by 1%.The company’s key drug, Humira, is likely to remain the main growth driver in the second quarter. Increasing awareness, favorable clinical data, additional indications and expansion into new markets are expected to help the product continue making significant contributions to the top line. This quarter, AbbVie also expects Humira sales growth in the U.S. in the mid-to-high teens range while internationally, Humira sales are expected to rise in a mid-single-digit range on an operational basis.Though Humira is doing well, the company is concerned about the product’s long-term prospects owing to the potential biosimilar competition.Another area of focus is the performance of Imbruvica, added to AbbVie’s portfolio following its May 2015 acquisition of Pharmacyclics. The drug recorded strong sales since past few quarters, a trend that we expect to continue. Imbruvica has multi-billion dollar potential and the company is looking to expand the drug’s label for solid tumors and autoimmune diseases.The company expects the Imbruvica sales growth in the U.S. to approach 35% in the second quarter.Although Imbruvica has huge commercial potential, investors should know that revenues from it will be shared with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), which has a collaboration agreement with Pharmacyclics.Other drugs like Duopa and Creon are also expected to continue to perform well in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.However, Abbvie’s Hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment, Viekira, will continue to be adversely impacted by an intense pricing and competitive pressure in the HCV market.Notably, last month, the company announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended a marketing approval of its investigational, hepatitis C virus (HCV) combo regimen of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P). The candidate will be marketed by the trade name of Maviret.A decision from the European Commission is expected in the third quarter of 2017. An approval will definitely provide the company with a stronger presence against the competitive dynamics in the HCV market.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that AbbVie is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for AbbVie is -0.71% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.39 per share and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands higher at $1.40. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Though AbbVie’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of the ESP, its -0.71% Earnings ESP makes the surprise prediction difficult.We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some better-ranked health care stocks that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release its results on Aug 9.

2271,PFE,"HCA Healthcare, Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 25, before the market opens.Last quarter, this hospital company posted in-line results. It has, however, surpassed earnings estimates in three out of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 6.47%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Q2 FlashbackThe company’s commercial volumes have been stressed over the past few quarters. It has taken  efforts to build out its local networks and create greater patient access both from an outpatient facilities standpoint and a digital media standpoint to address the issue. We, however, don’t expect to see any major improvement in this business in the second quarter.Last quarter, the company reported the 12th consecutive quarter of equivalent admission growth for HCA and we expect the trend to continue in the second quarter.HCA Healthcare consistently makes capital expenditure for the expansion of services and capacity in its large fast growing urban markets. In 2016, it incurred $2.76 billion in this regard and expects to invest $2.9 billion in 2017. The company has also made a number of acquisitions over the past many years to expedite growth. We believe these investments will generate top-line growth by increasing business volumes.Share bought back by the company during the to-be reported will cushion the bottom line. The company has not paid regular dividend since its IPO in 2011. It prefers share buyback over dividend payment for allocating capital and will maintain its current policy on dividend payouts.HCA Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise HCA Holdings, Inc.

2272,PFE,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that its leukemia candidate, Besponsa (inotuzumab ozogamicin) has been approved by the FDA, though with a boxed warning on the label.Pfizer’s shares were down more than 1% on Thursday. So far this year, Pfizer’s shares are up 4.5%, comparing unfavorably with an increase of 13.8% for the industry. Besponsa has been approved as a monotherapy for the treatment of relapsed or refractory CD22-positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The drug was approved in the EU last month.The U.S. approval was based on data from a pivotal study, INO-VATE ALL, which demonstrated that patients treated with Besponsa showed significant improvement in complete response (81% in Besponsa arm versus 29% for chemotherapy), thereby meeting the primary endpoint. The study, however, failed to reach statistical significance in the analysis of overall survival (OS).The median OS in the Besponsa arm was 7.7 months versus 6.2 months for patients treated with chemotherapy.Importantly, the U.S. label of the drug will include a boxed warning for hepatotoxicity i.e. liver damage, including hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD). The label will also have a warning related to increased risk of non-relapse mortality in patients who take the medicine post-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).We remind investors that inotuzumab ozogamicin was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation in the U.S. for ALL.Meanwhile, Pfizer boasts a strong oncology pipeline. Its key cancer candidate, Bavencio/avelumab received FDA approval for metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in Mar 2017 and for advanced bladder cancer in May. Bavencio is under review in the EU for MCC with a decision expected in the third quarter of 2017. Bavencio is being touted as a significant top-line driver for this New York-based pharma giant. Meanwhile, Pfizer is exploring the possibility of expanding the label of its breast cancer drug, Ibrance, into recurrent and subsequent early breast cancer as well as several non-breast cancer indications like pancreatic and head and neck cancers.Other cancer candidates include talazoparib (advanced breast cancer) and dacomitinib (advanced lung cancer with EGFR activating mutations).At the Q1 conference call, Pfizer had mentioned that approximately 25 to 30 drug approvals are expected over the next five years. These include around 15 products that have blockbuster potential.  Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2273,PFE,"Over the past week, several of the Wall Street’s most talked about companies have posted their Q2 reports, but earnings season is far from over. Indeed, investors still have the latest reports from several tech giants and major market movers to look forward to, which means it’s more important than ever to stay tuned in.With that said, the massive amount of earnings reports coming out can be overwhelming for investors. Luckily, Zacks readers can utilize the Zacks Earnings Calendar in order to keep track of specific earnings releases, dividend announcements, and other vital news than can have a large impact on portfolios.Using the Earnings Calendar, we are looking ahead to next week to target the most important upcoming reports. Check out these four companies that are expected to release an earnings report during the week of July 31:Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report)) – Tuesday, August 1 – Before Market OpenPharma giant Pfizer is set to report its second-quarter results before the bell on Tuesday. So far, the company’s large-cap pharma peers are a perfect nine-for-nine on earnings beats, although industry share prices have slumped on weak outlook. Drug stocks soared after the promise of regulatory reform, but the market has seen a bit of a pullback thanks to the administration’s relative inaction.Analyst sentiment has been mixed on Pfizer, as we’ve seen two positive and two negative revisions for to its second-quarter earnings within the past 30 days. Our current consensus estimates are calling for the company to post EPS growth of 1.95% and a revenue dip of 0.97% for the quarter. Pfizer has a strong pipeline, but genericization of key drugs, lost alliance revenues, pricing pressure, and rising competition are all challenges this year.Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report)) – Tuesday, August 1 – After Market CloseTech behemoth Apple is scheduled to release its fiscal third-quarter earnings report after the closing bell Tuesday. Earnings in the consumer tech space have been strong so far, but Apple has faced new questions related to its supply chain, and with users desperately waiting for details on the iPhone 8, the company could be poised to report device sales weakness this quarter.Nevertheless, a handful of new gadgets, including the company’s wireless EarPods, did debut recently, and that could help lift sales slightly. According to our current Zacks Consensus Estimates, Apple is expected to record EPS growth of 10.56% and revenue growth 5.55% this quarter. The stock also sports an Earnings ESP of 1.27%, and along with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), that should make investors feel more optimistic about the company’s chances to beat earnings estimates.Time Warner Inc. ) – Wednesday, August 2 – Before Market OpenCable TV leader Time Warner is set to announce its second-quarter earnings results before the market opens on Wednesday. Due to the company’s pending merger with AT&T (T  -  Free Report), Time Warner will not hold an earnings conference call, but the report will give investors an important update on the state of its business before it joins AT&T.According to the latest Zacks Consensus Estimates, Time Warner is poised to post revenue growth of 5.59%, but earnings are expected to slip about 7.66%. However, sentiment has improved recently, and the stock currently has an Earnings ESP of 1.68%. On top of this, positive estimate revisions have moved the company to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which should give investors more confidence heading into its earnings report date.The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report)) – Thursday, August 3 – After Market CloseFood giant Kraft Heinz is scheduled to report its second-quarter results after the market closes on Thursday. As one of the biggest food companies in the world, Kraft Heinz’s report will give us a fresh look at the latest consumer trends. Recently, a shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food has hurt some of the company’s key segments.Heading into the report, just five out of nine of Kraft Heinz’s industry peers have surpassed earnings estimates this season, which underscores the challenges the industry has faced this year. So far in 2017, industry share prices have slipped more than 3%. Nevertheless, our current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for EPS growth of 13.11%, and given its Earnings ESP of 1.04%, it looks like the most recent sentiment has been positive.  Want more stock market analysis from this author?

2274,PFE,"Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AERI  -  Free Report) posted second-quarter 2017 loss of 82 cents per share (including stock-based compensation), narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 84 cents and the year-ago loss of 87 cents.Being a development-stage company, Aerie has not generated any revenues from product sales yet.We note that shares of Aerie have rallied 39.9% in the year so far outperforming the industry‘s 2.9% rally.Quarter in DetailIn the reported quarter, research and development expenses declined 20.3% to $10.6 million as the company completed trials in the U.S. General and administrative expenses increased 82.7% to $17.1 million. The higher operating expenses in the quarter were attributed to expansion of the employee base to support operations and commercialization preparatory activities, including commercial manufacturing costs for Rhopressa.Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. QuotePipeline UpdatesOn Feb 28, the company resubmitted a new drug application (NDA) for lead candidate Rhopressa 0.02% and expects a review period of 12 months. We note that Aerie withdrew the Rhopressa NDA filed in September as a third party manufacturing facility in Tampa, FL was not ready for pre-approval inspection by the FDA. The company initiated preparations to bring a second contract manufacturer online in 2018.Apart from Rhopressa, Aerie is evaluating Roclatan, a once-daily, quadruple-action fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa and Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xalatan. The company reported positive top-line 90-day efficacy and safety data from the second phase III clinical trial, Mercury 2. Data from Mercury 1 is expected in third-quarter 2017. If Mercury 1 and Mercury 2 are successful, the NDA for Roclatan is expected to be filed in early 2018.The company also expects to commence a trial, Mercury 3, in the third-quarter of 2017, in Europe to support filings there. The trial will be a non-inferiority trial comparing Roclatan to prescribed fixed dose combination of Ganfort (a combination of the bimatoprost along with timolol), marketed by Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) in Europe.Meanwhile, the company recently inked acollaboration agreement with DSM with primary focus on the potential of Aerie compounds to treat retinal diseases.Our TakeThe narrower-than-expected loss in the second quarter was encouraging. We are encouraged by the company's efforts in developing its pipeline candidates. A potential approval of Rhopressa in early 2018 will significantly boost growth prospects.Zacks Rank & Other Key PickAerie currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Another top-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Gilead Sciences.

Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that DENTSPLY is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of the two key components.Zacks ESP: DENTSPLY currently has an Earnings ESP of +4.55%.

Notably, this segment provides a broad spectrum of products that include preventive, restorative, instruments, endodontic and laboratory dental products, as well as consumable medical device products.Furthermore, DENTSPLY’s dental implants, CAD/CAM systems, imaging systems, treatment centers and orthodontic products in the technology segment are likely to drive sales.We are also upbeat about the gradual recovery in the U.S. market.

The average positive earnings surprise over the last four quarters is 4.36%Merck’s shares rose 6.9% this year so far, comparing unfavourably with 12.1% increase for the industry.Factors to ConsiderMerck’s new products like Keytruda (cancer), Zepatier (HCV) and Bridion (sugammadex) injection may drive the top line this quarter.We believe Keytruda’s sales will likely be driven by strong uptake, launch in new countries and expansion into additional indications, especially first-line NSCLC. In Mar/Apr 2017, Keytruda received FDA and EU approval for refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) - the first Keytruda approval for hematologic malignancy indication. In May, Keytruda was approved as first-line combination therapy for lung cancer – its first FDA approval as a combination therapy. The expanded indications, especially as a combination therapy, may add to Keytruda’s sales this quarter. This apart, continued strength in melanoma indication and rapid penetration of head and neck cancer indication might boost Keytruda sales.In the last couple of months, there were a series of regulatory approvals for the label expansion of Keytruda like advanced bladder cancer. We expect an update from management on the commercialization plans for the same at the conference call.At the first quarter conference call, management had said that it was working on securing reimbursement for Keytruda in first as well as second-line NSCLC indication outside U.S. and lung cancer sales will become a much larger contributor outside the country as the year progresses. We expect an update on this at the conference call.Meanwhile, ongoing launches globally are likely to support Zepatier’s sales.However, the company will continue to face headwinds in the form of genericization, increasing competition and the negative impact of currency exchange.Sales of Remicade (lost exclusivity in Europe and facing stiff biosimilar competition in the region), Nasonex (generic version launched in the U.S. in Mar 2016), Cubicin (lost patent protection in the U.S. in Jun 2016) and Zetia (lost market exclusivity in the U.S. in Dec 2016) will likely decline in the quarter.Sluggish growth of the integrase class and continued competitor dynamics in the U.S. and Europe may continue to affect Isentress’ sales.Investors focus will remain on the performance of Merck’s DPP-4 inhibitor – Januvia. Pricing pressure hurt sales of the Januvia/Janumet franchise in the first quarter. It remains to be seen if the trends improved in the second quarter.The vaccines and animal health franchises should also boost sales this quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Merck is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 87 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Merck’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Merck & Company, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Merck & Company, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Merck & Company, Inc. QuoteStocks to ConsiderStocks in the pharmaceuticals sector that also have a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are:Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO  -  Free Report), scheduled to release results on Aug 9, has an Earnings ESP of +3.57% and a Zacks Rank #2.

2278,PFE,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) reported mixed second-quarter 2017 results. While earnings beat expectations, sales missed the same. However, the drug and consumer products giant raised its 2017 sales and profit outlook, which sent shares up more than 1% in pre-market trading.This year so far, J&J’s share price is up 14.7%. This compares favorably with the 11.3% increase witnessed by the Zacks classified Large-Cap Pharma industry.Earnings BeatJ&J’s second-quarter 2017 earnings came in at $1.83 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.79 and increasing 5.2% from the year-ago period.Including one-time items, J&J reported second-quarter earnings of $1.40 per share, down 2.1% from the year-ago period.Sales Miss AgainSales came in at $18.84 billion, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.89 billion by 0.3%. Sales increased 1.9% from the year-ago quarter, reflecting an operational increase of 2.9% and a negative currency impact of 1%. Organically, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, sales increased 0.5% on an operational basis.Second-quarter sales grew 1.6% in the domestic market to $9.73 billion and 2.3% in international markets to $9.11 billion, reflecting 4.4% operational growth, partially offset by a 2.1% negative currency impact.Sales in DetailsPharmaceutical segment sales declined 0.2% year over year to $8.64 billion, reflecting 1% operational growth and 1.2% negative currency impact. Higher sales in international markets offset a weaker performance in the U.S.Sales in the domestic market declined 2.6% to $5.01 billion, while international sales grew 3.3% to $3.63 billion.New products like Imbruvica (cancer) and Darzalex (multiple myeloma) continued to perform well. Other growth drivers were Xarelto, Stelara and Invega Sustenna.However, sales of Invokana/Invokamet declined 23%. Also, Concerta declined 23.9% while Zytiga sales fell 7.2%.Importantly, sales of the blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade, marketed in partnership with Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report), declined 14% in the quarter with U.S. sales declining 13.9% and international sales declining 5.6% due to biosimilar competition. In this regard, we would like to mention that Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) launched its Inflectra injection, a biosimilar version of Remicade in the U.S. late last November. This did not have any significant impact on Remicade sales in the past two quarters. Management is expected to comment on the impact of the biosimilar on second-quarter sales at the conference call.J&J’s Pharma segment achieved some clinical milestones during the quarter. These included the FDA approval for Darzalex to be used in combination with Celgene Corporation’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Pomalyst (pomalidomide) and dexamethasone for the third-line treatment of multiple myeloma. Importantly, last week, J&J announced FDA approval for its pipeline candidate guselkumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The drug will be marketed by the trade name of Tremfya.Meanwhile, last month J&J completed its previously announced $30 billion acquisition of Swiss biotech Actelion, which will diversify its revenuesto the pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) category. Actelion’s PAH drugs added $91 million to the top line in the quarter.Medical Devices segment sales came in at $6.73 billion, up 4.9% from the year-ago period. It included an operational increase of 5.9% and negative currency movement of 1%. Sales gained mainly from the inclusion of Abbott Medical Optics acquisition. Excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures, on an operational basis, worldwide sales increased 1.1%.Sales in the domestic market rose 6.1% year over year to $3.23 billion. International market sales increased 3.9% (operational increase of 5.8%) year over year to $3.5 billion.Operational growth was driven by the Advanced Surgery business; electrophysiology products in the Cardiovascular business and Acuvue contact lenses in the Vision Care business, which made up for a weaker sales performance in the Diabetes Care unitThe Consumer segment recorded revenues of $3.48 billion in the reported quarter, up 1.7% year over year(operational increase of 2.3%). Foreign currency movement negatively impacted sales in the segment by 0.6%. Sales in the domestic market grew 7.4% from the year-ago period to $1.49 billion.Slower growth in baby care products was partially offset by growth in over-the-counter products.Meanwhile, the international segment recorded a decline of 2.2% to $1.99 billion, reflecting an operational decline of 1.1% and a negative currency impact of 1.1%.2017 Guidance RaisedJ&J raised its earnings guidance for 2017 and increased the lower end of its sales outlook.J&J expects 2017 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $7.12 - $7.22, including currency impact, compared with $7.00 - $7.15 expected previously.The revenue guidance is in the range of $75.8 billion to $76.1 billion compared with $75.4 billion to $76.1 billion expected previouslyOur TakeDespite the third consecutive sales miss, J&J looks optimistic about a better sales performance in the second half. Chief executive officer, Alex Gorsky said that J&J’s sales growth will accelerate in the second half of the year.Importantly, sales in the Medical Device segment are picking up, which made up for lower sales in the international Consumer and U.S. Pharmaceutical segments in the quarter. Sales in J&J’s domestic Pharma segment have decelerated this year as key growth drivers have slowed down due to competition. Quite a few products in its portfolio like Remicade and Concerta are facing generic competition. However, we believe that new products like Tremfya, label expansion of drugs like Imbruvica and Darzalex and contribution from Actelion could lead to better sales trends in the remaining half of the year.J&J carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2279,PFE,"Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (PRTK  -  Free Report) announced positive results from a phase III study (OASIS-2) comparing its antibiotic candidate omadacycline to Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Zyvox for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI).The study met the key primary and secondary endpoints and Paratek Pharma looks set to file a new drug application (NDA) with the FDA in the first half of 2018. Shares were up more than 5% in after-hours trading.The OASIS-2 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of an oral once-daily dose of omadacycline against a twice daily dose of Zyvox.The study met the FDA specified primary efficacy endpoint of statistical non-inferiority (NI) at early clinical response (ECR), 48 to 72 hours after the first dose of the drug in the study. The ECR for omadacycline was found to be 87.5% compared to 82.5% for Zyvox.Additionally, the study met statistical NI in European Medicines Agency specified co-primary endpoints for post-treatment evaluation (PTE). The clinical success rates in modified intent-to-treat population for the omadacycline and Zyvox arms were 84.2% and 80.8%, respectively. The rates were 97.9% for omadacycline versus 95.5% in Zyvox arm in the clinically evaluable populations.We remind investors that omadacycline has now shown positive results in three phase III studies, namely OASIS-2, OASIS-1 and OPTIC studies.The OASIS-2 study data shows that omadacycline can be prescribed as an oral-only dosing regimen in the outpatient setting. This is expected to reduce the need for hospital admission for the treatment of ABSSSI.Data from OASIS-1 announced last year showed that the candidate met the FDA specified primary efficacy endpoint of ECR. The ECR for omadacycline was found to be 84.8% compared to 85.5% in the Zyvox arm.Data from the OPTIC study announced in Apr 2017 demonstrated statistical non-inferiority of omadacycline to Bayer AG’s (BAYRY  -  Free Report) Avelox for the treatment of adults with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) at ECR of 72-120 hours after initiation of therapy. It was also found to be statistically non-inferior to Avelox in the post-treatment evaluation.Paratek intends to present results from these studies along with data for the secondary endpoints at an upcoming scientific congress.The NDA for omadacycline will be for the treatment of both ABSSSI and CABP and will include data from all three studies. We note that omadacycline enjoys Fast Track status in the U.S.The company also intends to file for FDA approval for another pipeline candidate, sarecycline, for the treatment of acne, in the second half of the year. Paratek is developing this candidate along with Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) and announced positive results in the first quarter of 2017. The study met its primary endpoint.The positive developments have pushed up Paratek’s share price by 62% so far this year. It outperformed the Zacks classified Medical – Generic Drugs industry, which increased 8.7% in the same period.Zacks RankParatek currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2280,PFE,"Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for Xeljanz has been accepted for review by the FDA. Xeljanz (5 mg twice daily), a JAK inhibitor, is presently approved in the U.S. as a second-line treatment for moderate-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients who have had an inadequate response to or cannot tolerate methotrexate. The drug was approved in Europe and China in March this year for RA.With the latest application, the company is looking to get the drug’s label expanded to include treatment of adult patients suffering from moderate-to-severe active ulcerative colitis (UC). A response from the FDA is expected in March next year.Pfizer’s shares are up 2.5% so far this year, comparing unfavorably with the Zacks classified Large-Cap Pharma industry’s gain of 11.3%.The acceptance of the sNDA was based on data from three pivotal studies from the OCTAVE global clinical development program constituting of OCTAVE Induction 1, OCTAVE Induction 2 and OCTAVE Sustain. It also included data from an open label extension study of Xeljanz, evaluating its long-term effects in patients who had completed treatment or had failure in OCTAVE Sustain, or did not respond to treatment in OCTAVE 1 or 2.The data from the studies demonstrated that Xeljanz was more effective than placebo in inducing and maintaining remission in patients. Data showed that 18.5% patients were in remission compared to 8.2% for placebo in OCTAVE 1 whereas 16.6% patients were in remission versus 3.6% for placebo in OCTAVE 2 at week 8. OCTAVE Sustain, evaluating two different administrations, achieved remission in 34.3% (5mg) and 40.6% (10mg) of patients compared to 11.1% for placebo at week 52.OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2 studies evaluated the induction of remission for a twice daily 10mg oral administration of the drug in patients with UC. OCTAVE Sustain evaluated Xeljanz (5mg and 10 mg) as maintenance therapy in patients including those who achieved at least clinical response in OCTAVE Induction 1 or 2.We are encouraged by Pfizer’s label expansion efforts. Xeljanz U.S. sales were up 27% year over year to $250 million in the first quarter of 2017. Label expansion of the drug should boost sales further.Meanwhile, another sNDA for Xeljanz is under review in the U.S. for psoriatic arthritis, which was filed in May this year. A response from the agency is expected in Dec 2017.Pfizer, Inc. Price and Consensus Pfizer, Inc. Price and Consensus | Pfizer, Inc.

2281,PFE,"Though we’ve seen plenty of marquee names put out quarterly earnings reports already in this calendar Q2 — with Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report)due after the closing bell this afternoon — there are still a large amount of well-known firms having reported in Tuesday’s pre-market. UnderArmour (UAA  -  Free Report), Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Archer Daniels Midland (ADM  -  Free Report), among others, hit the tape this morning.We also see new econ datas this morning and on the horizon, including Personal Income and Spending reads. These precede tomorrow’s ADP private sector jobs report, which itself precedes Friday’s full non-farm payroll results. In other words, a full plate of data to help move the needle for investors in the hours and days ahead.The June read for Personal Income and Spending was a disappointment: unchanged from the previous month, which itself was bumped down from 0.4% to 0.3% from its initial reported number. Analysts had expected another +0.4% in income growth. Spending came in as expected: +0.1% for June. These figures continue to show the lag between production and wage growth continues, keeping prices lower for longer, including employee salaries, while spending remained constant.Specialty retailer UnderArmour outperformed expectations in its Q2, posting a loss much narrower on the bottom line than expected: -3 cents per share compared to -6 cents. Quarterly sales of $1.088 billion also beat expectations of $1.075 billion. However, when the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company lowered full-year 2017 guidance to below the current Zacks consensus, UAA shares fell like a stone. They’ve since rebounded, as the company’s restructuring initiatives (worth $130 million) look to make notable improvements in its longer-term plans.Pfizer reported a mixed Q2 this morning, beating estimates on the bottom line by 2 cents to 67 cents per share, but once again coming up short on the revenue side, $12.9 billion compared to the $13.0 billion in the Zacks consensus. However, earnings guidance for 2017 was raised this morning, though sales guidance stayed pat.Archer Daniels Midland outperformed expectations on its bottom line, posting 57 cents per share as opposed to 52 cents analysts were looking for. This breaks a fairly woeful previous year of earnings, three of four which failed to meet consensus. That said, quarterly sales came in almost a billion dollars light from expectations: $14.94 billion (-4.4% year over year) compared with the $15.84 billion in the estimate.London-based BP (BP  -  Free Report) brought a solid earnings surprise ahead of the opening bell today, reporting 21 cents per share, a full dime higher than the Zacks consensus estimate. However, revenues also fell short of expectations, bringing in $57.37 billion in the quarter compared to the $64.51 billion estimated. Oil (equivalent) production was up 9% year over year, and price realization improved nicely year over year.
"
2282,PFE,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of 67 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 65 cents by 3.1%. Earnings also rose 5% year over year.On the other hand, revenues missed expectations. The pharma heavyweight delivered revenues of $12.90 billion, which fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.02 billion. Again, revenues declined 2% from the year-ago period due to currency headwinds and divestiture of Hospira infusion systems business. In Feb 2017, Pfizer divested its Hospira infusion systems (HIS) business to ICU Medical.Sales in DetailCurrency movement impacted Pfizer’s second-quarter revenues by 2% ($202 million). Sales growth was flat on an operational basis. Excluding HIS revenues, sales rose 2% on an operational basis.Lower sales of Enbrel and the Prevnar/Prevenar 13 vaccines franchise and loss of exclusivity for some products  offset strong performance of key products like Ibrance (breast cancer), Xtandi (prostate cancer) and Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis).International revenues declined 3% (flat on an operational basis) to $6.55 billion. Meanwhile, U.S. revenues were flat at $6.34 billion.Segment DiscussionFrom the second quarter of 2016, Pfizer reorganized its reporting segments to Pfizer Innovative Health (IH) and Pfizer Essential Health (EH).Pfizer IH sales grew 8% (up 9% operationally) from the year-ago period to $7.67 billion.Pfizer IH revenues were driven by persistently strong momentum of Ibrance and Eliquis globally and growth of Lyrica and Xeljanz primarily in the U.S.While Ibrance revenues rose 66% to $853 million in the quarter, Xeljanz rose 55% to $336 million. Lyrica sales rose 5% to $1.10 billion. Eliquis alliance revenues and direct sales rose 50% to $605 million.Revenues from the blockbuster prostate cancer drug Xtandi, added to Pfizer’s portfolio following the Sep 2016 Medivation acquisition, also propelled U.S. revenues. Xtandi recorded alliance revenues of $141 million in the quarter compared with $131 million in the first quarter.This was partially offset by continued decline in revenues from Prevnar 13 in U.S. and lower revenues of Enbrel and Viagra.Enbrel revenues declined 20% to $617 million in key European markets due to biosimilar competition. Pfizer has exclusive rights to Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis(RA) drug, Enbrel, outside the U.S. and Canada. Viagra sales declined 15% to $255 million due to lower sales in the U.S. and international markets due on reduced demand.Global Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 revenues declined 8% to $1.15 billion. Prevnar 13 revenues tanked 16% in the U.S. due to “high initial capture rate” of the eligible adult patient population following its successful 2014 launch. This resulted in a smaller remaining “catch up” opportunity in the second quarter compared with the year-ago quarter. Unfavorable timing of government purchases for the pediatric indication also hurt U.S. sales.Eucrisa (crisaborole) topical ointment for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (eczema), which was bought as part of the Jun 2016 Anacor acquisition, was launched in the U.S. in first quarter of 2017. The ointment recorded sales of $9 million in the second quarter.While Consumer Healthcare revenues rose 1% to $846 million, Global Oncology revenues surged 44% to $1.59 billion driven by Ibrance. Global Vaccine revenues declined 7% to $1.27 billion. While Internal Medicine rose 10% to $2.41 billion, the Inflammation & Immunology franchise declined 1% to $992 million. Additionally, the portfolio of Rare Disease declined 8% to $562 million.Pfizer EH segment sales recorded a decline of 14% (down 12% operationally) to $5.23 billion. Excluding HIS revenues, EH sales declined 7%.EH revenues were hurt by the loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for products like Pristiq (generic versions launched in the U.S. in Mar 2017), Vfend, Zyvox, Celebrex, Lyrica; lower revenues from legacy Hospira products and divesture of HIS. However, in the EH business, biosimilars did well in the quarter.Pfizer launched Inflectra, a biosimilar version of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Merck & Co., Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) blockbuster RA drug Remicade, in November last year. While Inflectra recorded sales of $23 million in the U.S. and $94 million globally, all other biosimilars brought in sales of $27 million (down 18%) from outside the U.S. markets.Adjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI&A) expenses were flat (operationally) in the quarter at $3.39 billion. Adjusted R&D expenses rose 2% to $1.77 billion.2017 Guidance UpdatedWhile Pfizer raised the lower end of its adjusted earnings guidance, it retained the revenue expectations for the year. Revenues are expected in the range of $52 billion to $54 billion.Adjusted earnings per share are expected in the range of $2.54 - $2.60 compared with $2.50–$2.60 expected previously. Higher than previously anticipated royalty income from certain products and lower interest cost led to the increase in the lower end of the profit outlook.At the mid-point, revenues are expected to be slightly above 2016 level, while adjusted EPS is expected to increase 7% (previously 6%).Research and development expenses are still expected in the range of $7.5–$8.0 billion, while SI&A spending is projected in the range of $13.7–$14.7 billion.Key Drugs ApprovalsImportantly, key pipeline candidate Bavencio/avelumab received accelerated FDA approval for metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in Mar 2017 and for advanced bladder cancer in May. The candidate is being studied for different types of cancers including several combination therapies with other immuno-oncology agents.Another pipeline candidate, Besponsa (inotuzumab ozogamicin) was approved in the EU in June as a monotherapy for relapsed or refractory CD22-positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The candidate is under review in the U.S. with a FDA decision expected later this month.Our TakePfizer’s second-quarter results were mixed as it beat earnings estimates but missed the same on sales. Shares declined slightly in pre-market trading as the company continues to struggle with its sales performance. Pfizer’s shares are up 2.1% so far this year, comparing unfavorably with an increase of 10.7% for the industry.Pfizer continues to face headwinds in the form of genericization of key drugs, lost alliance revenues, pricing pressure and rising competition, which are hurting the top line. Products like Viagra, Lyrica and Chantix will lose exclusivity in a couple of years. Nonetheless, we believe that new products like Ibrance, contribution from acquisitions, cost-cutting efforts and share buybacks should help the company achieve its guidance. Pfizer also boasts a strong pipeline and expects approximately 25 to 30 drug approvals over the next five years, including around 15 products that have blockbuster potential. Bavencio is being considered a key long-term growth driver for Pfizer.Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

However, earnings guidance for 2017 was raised this morning, though sales guidance stayed pat.Archer Daniels Midland outperformed expectations on its bottom line, posting 57 cents per share as opposed to 52 cents analysts were looking for. This breaks a fairly woeful previous year of earnings, three of four which failed to meet consensus. That said, quarterly sales came in almost a billion dollars light from expectations: $14.94 billion (-4.4% year over year) compared with the $15.84 billion in the estimate.London-based BP (BP  -  Free Report) brought a solid earnings surprise ahead of the opening bell today, reporting 21 cents per share, a full dime higher than the Zacks consensus estimate. However, revenues also fell short of expectations, bringing in $57.37 billion in the quarter compared to the $64.51 billion estimated. Oil (equivalent) production was up 9% year over year, and price realization improved nicely year over year.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

2284,PFE,"Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 3.Becton, Dickinson has an impressive track of comfortably beating estimates in each of the four trailing quarters. In the last reported quarter, it delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.14%, bringing the four-quarter average to 5.58%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to the second-quarter earnings announcement.Factors at PlayBecton, Dickinson's innovative product pipeline is a key catalyst in our view. A plethora of regulatory approvals in the U.S. and International markets are helping the company to rapidly expand its product portfolio. Management at Becton, Dickinson expects that strong demand for its Pyxis ES platform and infusion pumps to be growth drivers in the fiscal second quarter. Overall for fiscal 2017, revenues are anticipated to increase approximately 4.5% to 5.0%.Additionally, partnerships and collaborations are providing the company a competitive edge. However, an unfavorable foreign exchange rate is anticipated to remain headwind for the rest of year. Furthermore, uncertainties associated with the possibilities of a repeal of the Affordable Care Act under President Trump add to the company’s concerns.The company’s estimate revision trend lacks luster. For the current quarter, one analyst moved south compared to no upward revision in the last two months. Over the last three months, the current quarter estimates declined from $2.47 per share to $2.44, adding to our concerns. Overall for fiscal 2017, adjusted earnings (on a currency-neutral basis) are expected in the range of $9.70 to $9.80, reflecting year-over-year growth of 13.0% to 14.0%. However, after including the estimated unfavorable impact from foreign currency, the company expects adjusted diluted earnings per share between $9.35 and $9.45, representing an increase of approximately 9% to 10%. Becton, Dickinson and Company Price and EPS Surprise  Becton, Dickinson and Company Price and EPS Surprise | Becton, Dickinson and Company QuoteEarnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Becton, Dickinson is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

2285,PFE,"Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) is one of the most well-known names in the pharmaceutical sector not just for its medicines and vaccines but also for its consumer healthcare products. This New York-based company is well known for products like Prevnar, Lyrica, Lipitor and Celebrex among others.However, like many of its peers, PFE is facing generic competition and pricing pressure for several products like Lipitor, Norvasc, Protonix, Camptosar, Celebrex and Zoloft. Other than that lost alliance revenues, pricing pressure and rising competition are hurting the top-line.In this scenario, investor focus remains on late-stage pipeline candidates and their commercial potential and performance of new products apart from the usual top-and bottom-line numbers.The pharma giant has a mixed record of earnings surprises. The company’s earnings surpassed expectations in two of the last four quarters while missing in the other two, resulting in an average negative surprise of 0.35%.Currently, PFE has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but that could definitely change following the company’s earnings report which was just released.

2286,PFE,"The FDA, which approved 22 treatments last year, has given its approval to 26 drugs so far in 2017 including 3 in July. Key approvals this year include Gilead’s Vosevi (hepatitis C virus), Puma’s Nerlynx (to reduce the risk of breast cancer returning), J&J’s Tremfya (moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis), Regeneron/Sanofi’s Kevzara (rheumatoid arthritis), Roche’s multiple sclerosis treatment, Ocrevus, Regeneron and Sanofi’s eczema treatment, Dupixent, Tesaro’s PARP inhibitor, Zejula, and BioMarin’s Brineura (treatment of a specific form of Batten disease) among others. Some of these drugs have blockbuster potential.With the drug development process being lengthy and time-consuming and requiring the utilization of a lot of funds and resources, key pipeline events including data readouts and regulatory updates are of paramount importance and could act as major catalysts. Here is a look at a few important regulatory events scheduled for the month of August.Another New Indication for Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo?Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) is looking to get the label of its PD-1 inhibitor expanded for use in patients with mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) after prior fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based chemotherapy. The regulatory application is currently under priority review with a response expected on Aug 2, 2017. Opidivo is currently approved for a wide range of indications and brought in sales of $2.3 billion in the first half of 2017. Bristol-Myers has lost 2.6% of its value year to date (YTD) versus the 10.5% growth of its industry.Will J&J RA Drug Win Support of FDA Panel?The FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee will be meeting tomorrow to discuss the BLA for Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) investigational rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, Plivensia (sirukumab), an IL-6 inhibitor. The company is looking to get Plivensia approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response or are intolerant to one or more disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). RA is a common, chronic, life-long, autoimmune disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the U.S. While new treatment options have entered the market over the last couple of decades, RA patients are still not adequately managed with many left with fewer therapeutic options due to loss of response to available agents, and poor compliance due to inconvenient dosing.Earlier this week, the FDA had released briefing documents for the meeting which indicate a lot of emphasis will be placed on the safety profile of the drug especially the imbalance in all cause death between Plivensia and placebo. If approved, Plivensia would enter a pretty crowded market given the presence of drugs like Humira, Actemra and Kevzara among others, though its once-monthly dosing schedule could give it an advantage. Shares of J&J have gained 15.2% YTD, outperforming the industry’s rally.Will FDA Follow in EU’s Path and Give the Green Signal to AbbVie’s Maviret?AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) also has an important regulatory event coming up with the FDA expected to respond on the approval status of the company’s latest hepatitis C virus (HCV) offering this month. Maviret, an investigational, pan-genotypic regimen of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P), is a once-daily ribavirin-free treatment that has the potential to provide a faster path to virologic cure for all major HCV genotypes (GT1-6). Maviret represents blockbuster potential and could help AbbVie gain major market share once approved and launched. We note that Maviret gained EU approval just last week. Shares of AbbVie have gained 11.6% YTD, outperforming the industry’s rally.Third Time Lucky for Dynavax’s Heplisav-B?It’s been a great week for clinical-stage immunology company Dynavax Technologies Corp. (DVAX  -  Free Report) which got a favorable recommendation (12-1) from the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) for Heplisav-B, a vaccine for immunization against hepatitis B infection in adults. With the positive vote, will it be third time lucky for the company which has previously received two complete response letters for Heplisav-B (one in Nov 2016 and the other in Feb 2013) from the FDA? A decision from the agency is expected on Aug 10. If approved, Dynavax plans to launch the vaccine early next year. Dynavax’s shares shot up 71.4% on the positive panel vote and are up a whopping 301.3% YTD, significantly outperforming the industry’s10.5% rally.Pfizer’s Xeljanz to Be Reviewed by FDA Advisory PanelPfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) has two regulatory events this month -- the first is an FDA advisory panel meeting and the other a PDUFA date. The FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee will be meeting on Aug 3 to discuss supplemental new drug applications (sNDAs) submitted by the company for its JAK inhibitor, Xeljanz and Xeljanz XR, for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis. Efficacy and safety data and benefit-risk considerations will be discussed by the panel. Xeljanz, currently approved for RA, brought in sales of $927 million in 2016.Meanwhile, the FDA is expected to give a response regarding the approval status of Pfizer’s Besponsa which recently gained approval in the EU. If approved in the U.S., Besponsa will provide a new treatment option for adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), an aggressive type of blood cancer with poor prognosis in adults. According to information provided by Pfizer, the 5-year overall survival rate for patients with relapsed or refractory adult ALL is less than 10%. Pfizer stock has gained 2.1% YTD, lagging the industry it belongs to. Pfizer is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock -- you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Some other FDA decisions scheduled for this month include a response regarding Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AGIO  -  Free Report) and partner Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Idhifa (under priority review for relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with an IDH2 mutation) on Aug 30. Meanwhile, the FDA is expected to decide on the approval status of Valeant’s eye drug, Vesneo (latanoprostene bunod) and Adamas’ ADS-5102 (treatment of levodopa-induced dyskinesia in people with Parkinson's disease) on Aug 24.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

2287,PFE,"It was a busy week for the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) which reviewed several experimental treatments this week including Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) CAR-T cell drug. Meanwhile, French pharma giant Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) announced it will be acquiring a vaccines company.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesFDA Panel Supports Novartis Car-T Drug: Novartis got a huge boost with an FDA advisory panel voting unanimously in favor of the company’s experimental CAR-T cell therapy CTL019. Novartis is looking to get the treatment approved for pediatric, young adult relapsed or refractory (r/r) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The positive vote is a major milestone for the company which could become the first to launch a CAR-T cell therapy if the FDA follows the advisory panel’s advice. CTL019 is currently under priority review in the U.S. -- with the advisory panel issuing a positive recommendation, we believe chances of gaining approval are high (Read more: Novartis CAR-T Therapy Drug Recommended by FDA Panel).So far in 2017, Novartis has outperformed the Zacks categorized Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry with shares gaining 13.3% while the industry is up 11.3%.FDA Nod for J&J Psoriasis Treatment: J&J’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Tremfya gained FDA approval for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. This makes the drug the first and only biologic approved that selectively blocks only IL-23, a cytokine that plays a key role in plaque psoriasis. Although the psoriasis market is pretty crowded, Tremfya demonstrated superior results in skin clearance compared with Humira in head-to-head analyses at weeks 16, 24 and 48.Tremfya is currently in a late-stage study for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis and a phase III program evaluating its efficacy compared with Cosentyx in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.Mar 2018 PDUFA Date for Pfizer’s Xeljanz Label Expansion: Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) sNDA for Xeljanz has been accepted for review by the FDA with a response expected in Mar 2018. Timely approval would make Xeljanz the first oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor to be available for people living with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC).Pfizer also got a favorable vote from the FDA’s advisory panel for its acute myeloid leukemia (AML) drug, Mylotarg, for newly-diagnosed patients. A final decision from the FDA should be out by Sep 2017. Mylotarg was initially approved in 2000 but was subsequently withdrawn from the market after a late-stage study failed to show a clinical benefit. Moreover, a higher rate of fatalities resulting from treatment-related toxicity was observed in the Mylotarg arm.Priority Review for Lilly’s Advanced Breast Cancer Drug: Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) got priority review from the FDA for its CDK 4 & 6 inhibitor abemaciclib. The company is looking to get abemaciclib approved as monotherapy and combination therapy (with fulvestrant) for patients with advanced breast cancer. Given the priority review status, Lilly should get a response from the FDA in the first quarter of 2018. Currently approved CDK 4/6 inhibitors include Pfizer’s Ibrance and Novartis’ Kisqali (Read more: Lilly's Breast Cancer Drug Gets Priority Review Status by FDA).Lilly also entered into a settlement agreement with generic players to settle patent infringement lawsuits related to the Cialis (tadalafil) unit dose patent. With the settlement agreement, the patent, which was previously set to expire on Apr 26, 2020, will now end on Sep 27, 2018. Cialis is approved for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) and the frustrating urinary symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Cialis sales were $2.5 billion in 2016.Lilly said that the Adcirca (tadalafil) patent will remain protected until Nov 21, 2017, or May 21, 2018, if pediatric exclusivity is granted. Adcirca is approved for pulmonary arterial hypertension (Read more: Lilly Settles Patent Litigation on Cialis with Generic Firms).Sanofi to Buy Vaccines Company for Up To $750M: Sanofi, which failed in its efforts to acquire Medivation and Actelion, announced that it will be acquiring Protein Sciences, a U.S.-based privately held vaccines biotech company, for up to $750 million. This includes an upfront payment of $650 million and up to $100 million on the achievement of certain milestones.  With this acquisition, Sanofi is looking to expand its flu portfolio with the addition of a non-egg based vaccine. Protein Sciences’ Flublok Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV), which was approved by the FDA in Oct 2016, is the only recombinant protein-based flu vaccine approved by the agency. The acquisition is scheduled to close in the third quarter of 2017.  Sanofi is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock -- you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Mylan’s Herceptin Biosimilar Gets Favorable Panel Vote: Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) got a boost with its biosimilar version of Herceptin (trastuzumab) getting a favorable recommendation from an FDA advisory panel. The panel voted 16-0 in support of eligible indications of the reference product which include HER2+ breast cancer in the metastatic and adjuvant settings. The biosimilar version has been developed under a collaboration with Biocon.PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index gained 0.4% over the last five trading sessions.

2288,PFE,"Shares of Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report) have gained almost 4.68% on Aug 12. The company’s shares have rallied a whopping 77% this year so far, outperforming the 7.8% increase registered by the Zacks categorized Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry during this period. Here we analyze the factors that led to the rally.Exelixis is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing small-molecule therapies for the treatment of cancer.Exelixis’ lead product, Cometriq, the capsule form of cabozantinib, was approved in the U.S. in 2012 for the treatment of progressive, metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC).Exelixis is developing cabozantinib in a broad development program comprising over 45 clinical studies across multiple indications. The company received a major impetus in Apr 2016 when the FDA approved the tablet formulation of cabozantinib, (distinct from the capsule form) under the brand name Cabometyx for the treatment of RCC in patients who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy. Cabometyx was also approved in EU in Sept 2016 for the treatment of advanced RCC in adults who have received prior vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy.Results from the phase II CABOSUN study on cabozantinib versus Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Sutentin formerly untreated advanced RCC were positive. Based on the CABOSUN results, the company has planned to submit a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for cabozantinib for treating first-line advanced RCC in the third quarter of 2017.The company presented further positive analysis from the trial in Jun 2017. A potential label expansion of the drug will further boost results.As per data from The American Cancer Society, kidney cancer is among the ten most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer among both men and women in the U.S. Hence, we believe Exelixis is poised to capture a major chunk of the market if approved for first-line kidney cancer.Meanwhile, in early 2017, Exelixis inkedagreements with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) and Roche Holdings AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) to develop cabozantinib in combination with immunotherapy agentsfurther. Exelixis collaborated with Bristol-Myers to evaluate cabozantinib in combination with Opdivo alone or in combination with Yervoy in a phase III trial in first-line RCC, and potentially in other tumor types including (HCC and bladder cancer). Both the companies have initiated a phase III trial, CheckMate 9ER in Jul 2017 to evaluate Opdivo in combination with Cabometyx or Opdivo and Yervoy in combination with Cabometyx versus Sutent in patients with previously untreated, advanced or metastatic RCC.Exelixis has also collaborated with Roche to evaluate cabozantinib in combination with Tecentriq, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, in patients with advanced RCC or bladder cancer. In Jun 2017, Exelixis initiated the dose-escalation stage of a phase Ib trial of cabozantinib in combination with Tecentriq. The drug will be evaluated in patients suffering from locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) or RCC.Label expansion into additional indications would give the product access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug.Zacks RankExelixis currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

2289,PFE,"We issued an updated research report on Corcept Therapeutics Inc. (CORT  -  Free Report) on Jul 12.Corcept’s shares have surged 71.2% year to date, comparing favorably with the Zacks classified Medical-Drugs industry’s gain of 6.3%.Currently, the company is striving to commercialize Korlym (mifepristone) successfully by deploying medical liaisons and sales representatives. In fact, Korlym  is its only marketed drug, which is approved for the treatment of patients with Cushing's syndrome.Notably, about 10–15 of every 1 million people are newly diagnosed with Cushing’s syndrome each year, resulting into more than 3,000 new patients annually in the U.S. Therefore, we believe increased awareness among physicians and patients about the drug and expanded sales efforts should boost sales, going forward.Corcept is currently working on developing the drug for additional indications. It is conducting a phase I/II safety and efficacy study on Korlym in combination with Eisai Co., Ltd.’s anti-cancer drug, Halaven, for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Enrolment in the study is complete and the company announced encouraging data in Dec 2016.We expect a successful label expansion of Korlym to boost the top line significantly, as the disease represents huge potential with as many as 40,000 women in the U.S. being diagnosed every year.Moreover, the University of Chicago is conducting a phase II study on Korlym, in combination with Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xtandi, for the treatment of metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer. The institution also plans to conduct a phase II study on Korlym, in combination with Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Abraxane, for the treatment of patients with TNBC.Importantly, apart from Korlym, Corcept is also evaluating CORT125134 for Cushing’s syndrome and a range of solid tumors. Early data on the candidate for Cushing’s syndrome has been quite promising. The company has begun dosing patients in a phase I/II study on CORT125134, in combination with Abraxane, for the treatment of a range of solid-tumor cancers. The possible target indications include triple-negative breast cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer and sarcoma. The company expects open expansion cohorts by the end of 2017.Additionally, the company has three promising preclinical candidates - CORT118335 (metabolic disorders), CORT122928 (alcohol withdrawal) and CORT125281 (castration-resistant prostate cancer, triple negative breast cancer, and ovarian cancer) – which are expected to enter the clinic in 2017.Also, during its first quarter 2017 earnings release, the company raised its 2017 revenue guidance. Now, Corcept projects revenues to be in the range of $125 million to $135 million more than its prior expectation of $120 million to $130 million.Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated Price and Consensus Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated Price and Consensus | Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCorcept currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2290,PFE,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.01 per share, which easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 87 cents by 16.1%. Earnings also rose 8.6% from the year-ago period.Revenues for the quarter increased 1% year over year to $9.93 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.79 billion. Currency movement negatively impacted revenues by 1%. Excluding currency impact, sales rose 2% year over year.Quarter in DetailThe Pharmaceutical segment posted revenues of $8.76 billion, up 1% (up 2% excluding Fx impact) year over year mainly backed by strong sales of PD-1 inhibitor, Keytruda.Keytruda brought in sales of $881 million in second-quarter 2017, up 51% sequentially and 180% year over year. Sales continued to be driven by launch of new indications globally.Keytruda sales in the U.S. gained particularly from strong momentum in the new indication of first-line lung cancer (approved in Oct 2016).In the last 2-3 months, there were a series of regulatory approvals for the label expansion of Keytruda that should drive sales going forward. Important approvals include that for advanced bladder cancer, advanced microsatellite instability-high cancers and first approval as a combination therapy with Eli Lilly & Company’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drug Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo), in lung cancer.However, earlier this month, a pivotal phase III study of Keytruda in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma failed to meet the primary endpoint of overall survival. Also, three combination studies of Keytruda for multiple myeloma were placed on clinical hold, this month, following reports of death in the Keytruda groups.Meanwhile, competition in the immuno-oncology market is rising following recent FDA approval of Pfizer, Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Bavencio (avelumab) in Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) and bladder cancer and AstraZeneca plc’s (AZN  -  Free Report) Imfinzi (durvalumab) in bladder cancer.Zepatier brought in sales of $517 million, up from $378 million in the previous quarter, attributable to ongoing launches globally.Bridion (sugammadex) Injection generated sales of $163 million in the quarter, up 44% year over year, driven by the strong uptake from launch in the U.S.Meanwhile, combined sales of Remicade (lost exclusivity in Europe and facing stiff biosimilar competition in the region), Cubicin (lost patent protection in the U.S. in Jun 2016), Zetia (lost market exclusivity in the U.S. in Dec 2016) and Vytorin (lost U.S. exclusivity in Apr 2017) declined $830 million in the quarter. Sales of Isentress and the Januvia/Janumet (diabetes) franchise also declined in the quarter.Remicade sales declined 39% to $208 million in the quarter. Merck markets the branded version of Remicade outside the U.S. while Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) markets the rheumatoid arthritis drug in the U.S. This week, Merck launched Renflexis, a biosimilar version of Remicade, in the U.S.Cubicin sales plunged 71% to $103 million in the quarter. The Zetia/Vytorin franchise recorded sales of $549 million, down 45% due to loss of exclusivity for both Zetia and Vytorin.The Januvia/Janumet franchise recorded sales of $1.51 billion in the quarter, down 8% from the year-ago quarter due to lower sales in the U.S. due to pricing pressure and lower customer inventory levels.Isentress sales declined 17% in the quarter to $282 million. Lower volumes/demand due to competitive pressure is hurting sales of Isentress.Vaccine sales were primarily driven by increases in Gardasil and Pneumovax vaccines. Vaccine sales were also boosted by the addition of approximately $70 million ($40 million from Gardasil) of sales from the terminated vaccine joint venture with Sanofi. Gardasil/Gardasil 9 sales climbed 19% to $469 million driven by strong demand in Asia Pacific and the favorable timing of sales in Brazil.Merck’s Animal Health segment posted revenues of $955 million, up 6% (up 7% excluding Fx impact) from the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by higher sales of companion animal products.Margin DiscussionAdjusted gross margin came in at 77.6%, up 190 basis points (bps) quarter attributable to favorable effects of product mix and lower inventory write-offsMarketing and administrative (M&A) expenses increased 3% to $2.4 billion in the reported quarter. Research and development (R&D) spend increased 8% to $1.7 billion in the quarter.2017 GuidanceDespite lowering its expectations for negative impact of currency exchange rates, the company maintained its previously adjusted earnings guidance while raising its sales guidance marginally. The company expects adjusted earnings in the range of $3.76–$3.88 including approximately 1.0% negative foreign exchange impact (versus 1.5% previously).Revenues are expected in the range of $39.4 billion – $40.4 billion compared with the earlier forecast of $39.1–$40.3 billion, including negative currency impact of approximately 1% (versus 1.5% previously).Operating expenses are expected to increase year over year at a mid-single-digit rate compared with a low single-digit rate expected previously.Our TakeMerck’s second-quarter earnings were encouraging as the company beat both on sales and earnings. Strong performance of new products like Keytruda, Bridion and Zepatier and higher sales of vaccines and animal health franchises offset lower sales of diabetes franchise and loss of market exclusivity for many drugs.Merck’s shares have risen 8.2% this year so far, comparing unfavorably with 9.9% increase for the industry.Merck also announced a cancer collaboration with AstraZeneca to jointly commercialize and develop the latter’s PARP Inhibitor, Lynparza, both as monotherapy and in combination studies, for multiple cancer types. Lynparzais presently marketed for advanced ovarian cancer. Meanwhile, Merck will independently develop combination medicines with Lynpraza and Keytruda. For the deal, Merck will pay up to $8.5 billion in total consideration, including $1.6 billion in upfront payments.Merck also said that a network cyber-attack in June disrupted its global operations which could result in a temporary delay in fulfilling orders of some products.Merck & Company, Inc.

2291,PFE,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Pfizer is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for PFE in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 66 cents per share for PFE, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 65 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for PFE, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 1.54% heading into earnings season. Pfizer, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Pfizer, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Pfizer, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that PFE has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Pfizer, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

2292,PFE,"We issued an updated research report on Boulder, CO-based Clovis Oncology, Inc. (CLVS  -  Free Report) on Jul 12.Clovis got a huge boost in Dec 2016 when the FDA granted accelerated approval to its PARP inhibitor, Rubraca (rucaparib) for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer, two months earlier than expected. The approval was based on an encouraging objective response rate and duration of response from Study 10 and ARIEL 2. Clovis had in-licensed Rubraca from Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) in 2011.The company has raised $221.2 million from  a public offering of common stock. The company plans to use a part of the net proceeds for commercial planning and sales and marketing expenses related to the launch of Rubraca in the U.S. and in Europe upon approval. General and administrative (G&A) expenses increased 198% year over year to $29.2 million in the first quarter of 2017, reflecting commercialization costs for Rubraca launch.In Apr 2017, Clovis announced an agreement with Myriad Genetics to use the latter’s FDA-approved BRACAnalysis CDx test to identify patients with germline BRCA mutations eligible for treatment with Rubraca. It has a previous agreement with Foundation Medicine to use its FoundationFocus CDxBRCA companion diagnostic test for the identification of eligible patients.So far this year, Clovis’ share price has significantly outperformed the Zacks categorized Medical-Biomed/Genetics industry. The stock has surged 114.6% compared with an increase of 7.9% for the broader industry.Rubraca is the only approved drug in the company’s portfolio and is the first and only oral PARP inhibitor to receive approval as monotherapy. The drug is approved for patients who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies, and selected for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for Rubraca.Further approval for Rubraca in the U.S. in this indication depends on clinical benefit in confirmatory studies - ARIEL3 and ARIEL4.Promising progression-free survival (PFS) and safety results from the ARIEL3 study were presented in Jun 2017, which showed that Rubraca has a meaningful impact in delaying disease recurrence in advanced ovarian cancer patients. Clovis is planning to file a regulatory application for label expansion to include a second line or later maintenance treatment for ovarian cancer based on ARIEL3 study in the second half of 2017.Meanwhile, the second phase III confirmatory study - ARIEL4 - is evaluating Rubraca versus chemotherapy in patients who have failed two prior lines of therapy.Meanwhile, Rubraca is also under review in the EU for a comparable ovarian cancer indication. An approval is expected in EU in late 2017 or early 2018 and Clovis is establishing the commercial infrastructure for the same.Rubraca’s prospects are bright as there is immense commercial potential in the target market and tremendous demand for PARP inhibitors. Per the American Cancer Society, ovarian cancer ranks fifth in deaths from cancer among women. Over 22,400 cases of ovarian cancer are estimated to be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2017. There is a huge unmet need for new treatment options, given that one in four women with ovarian cancer have a germline or somatic BRCA mutation.Rubraca recorded sales of $7 million in the first quarter of 2017. The company mentioned that in the first quarter over 300 different healthcare practitioners had prescribed Rubraca with over 350 new patients starting therapy.Successful commercialization will significantly boost Clovis’ top line, going forward.Moreover, Clovis is developing Rubraca in additional indications like prostrate, breast and pancreatic cancers, among others, either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents, including Tecentriq-Rubraca combination in gynecologic cancers. This combination study is sponsored by Roche.The company is expected to face competition from currently marketed drugs for ovarian cancer including AstraZeneca plc’s (AZN  -  Free Report) Lynparza. With the launch of Tesaro, Inc.’s (TSRO  -  Free Report) Zejula in Apr 2017, gaining market share for Rubraca will be challenging for Clovis.Clovis Oncology, Inc.

2293,PFE,"Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) will be reporting second-quarter 2017 earnings on Aug 3, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.90%.Allergan’s share price is up 20.5% this year so far, outperforming the 0.4% increase witnessed by the industry.Allergan’s earnings performance has been mixed so far, with the company beating expectations in three of the past four quarters and missing on one occasion. The average negative earnings surprise over the last four quarters is 0.27%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderWhile revenues are likely to be driven by new product launches, international growth and growth from key established products like Botox, Linzess, Restasis, earnings growth will likely be driven by revenues and operating expense management.The performance of new products like Avycaz (treatment for adult patients with complicated intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections), Vraylar (bipolar I disorder and schizophrenia), Kybella (double chin reduction) and Viberzi (adults suffering from irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea) will also be in focus. Viberzi, and Vraylar did well in the past three quarters and we expect the trend to continue in the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well. Viberzi was approved in Canada in May this year, which is likely to contribute to sales.However, Namenda IR is facing generic competition, which will continue to hurt sales of the drug. Namenda XR sales also declined in the previous quarters due to lower demand and shift of promotional efforts to Namzaric is a once-daily, fixed-dose combination of Namenda XR and Aricept. Investors will be interested to hear about Namzaric’s performance in the quarter. At the first quarter conference call, management had mentioned that Namzaric sales are benefitting from increased use of combination therapy as patients are transitioning from monotherapy Aricept to Namzaric.Asacol/Delzicol sales will also continue to be hurt by reduction in demand for Ascaol HD, following the launch of an authorized generic in Aug 2016. Minastrin 24 revenues are also likely to be hurt by loss of exclusivity in Mar 2017.Meanwhile, recent acquisitions of LifeCell (closed in Feb) and Zeltiq Aesthetics (closed in Apr) should support the top line in the quarter.At the first-quarter call, the company had hinted that operating margins will improve in the remaining quarters of the year as revenues grow.For the second quarter, the company expects revenues of approximately $33.9 billion to $4 billion. SG&A expenses are expected to be the highest in the second quarter due to continued strong promotion of key brands, the addition of Zeltiq, and the launch of Rhofade cream for rosacea.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Allergan is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Most Accurate estimate stands at $3.94, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $3.95. This results in an Earnings ESP of -0.25%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Allergan’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Allergan PLC.

2295,PFE,"Immune Design Corp. (IMDZ  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 2.Last quarter, Immune Design pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 19.35%. TIn fact, the company has posted a positive surprise in three of the four trailing quarters bringing the average surprise to 7.61%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Notably, Immune Design’s shares have skyrocketed 109.1% outperforming the Zacks classified industry’s gain of 4.4%.Factors at PlayBeing a development-stage biopharmaceutical company, Immune Design has not generated any product revenues yet. It earns revenues from collaboration and licensing agreements and product sales.Moreover, investors remain focused on the company’s progress with its pipeline candidates. Immune Design is developing multiple candidates using its two discovery platforms – ZVex and GLAAS – for the treatment of various types of cancers. Key pipeline candidates include CMB305 (solid tumor) and G100 (merkel cell carcinoma (MCC)).CMB305 has been designed under a prime-boost approach, involving the sequential dosing of two complementary agents – LV305 and G305. This candidate is being evaluated in soft tissue sarcoma (STS) patients both as monotherapy (phase I) and in combination with Roche Holding’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Tecentriq (phase II). It is to be noted that early data from the monotherapy phase I study were positive.The safety profile in the  monotherapy phase I study remained favorable with a consistent rate of NY-ESO-1-triggered T cell responses that appear stronger with CMB305.In addition, a randomized phase II study on CMB305, in combination with Tecentriq in comparison with Tecentriq alone, for locally advanced, relapsed or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma is currently underway. Data from the study is expected in 2017.Meanwhile, G100, developed on the GLAAS platform, completed enrolment in a phase I study in patients with MCC in combination with radiation. Immune Design is collaborating with Merck to evaluate G100 in combination with its anti-PD-1 agent Keytruda, for the treatment of patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). In February, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to, G100, for the treatment of NHL.The company completed a phase I study on G100 in patients with MCC. In addition, it has initiated a randomized phase II study evaluating the safety and efficacy of G100, in combination with low-dose local radiation and Keytruda, in patients with follicular non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). Data from the evaluation are expected in 2017.  During the earnings call, we expect Immune Design to shed light on its progress with these ongoing trialsWhat Our Model IndicatesOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Immune Design this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Immune Design has an Earnings ESP of 0.0%.

On an adjusted basis, revenues decreased 4.4% from the year-ago quarter and 0.6% sequentially to $841 million.The LCD glass market and Corning’s volume were up by low-single digit percentage on a sequential basis. The company noted that LCD glass prices declined moderately and substantially less than the previous quarter.Optical Communications generated 35.3% of total revenue. Reported segment revenues grew 12.8% year over year and 7.8% on a sequential basis to $882 million on the back of strong demand for fiber-to-the-home market solutions in North America. The year-over-year growth was much better than management’s anticipated increase of 10%.We note that the deal with Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report) reflects this strength, as U.S.-based service providers overhaul networks to improve 4G coverage and accelerate 5G deployments.The Environmental Technologies segment generated around 10.5% of revenues. Reported segment revenues were up 1.5% year over year but declined 4.4% sequentially to $275 million.

The company expects sequential LCD glass price declines to be similar to the sequential decline reported in the second-quarter 2017.Optical Communications sales are anticipated to increase more than 10% from the year-ago period in the third quarter.Environmental Technologies sales are expected to increase by low single-digit percentage, while Specialty Materials sales are anticipated to increase by low-to-mid teen percentage range. The Life Sciences business will grow low-single digit percentage from the year-ago quarter.For full-year 2017, Corning still expects mid-single digit percentage growth in glass volume, in line with the overall LCD glass market.

2298,PFE,"Dublin, OH-based Cardinal Health (CAH  -  Free Report), a global player in the healthcare services and products space, is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 2, before the bell.The company reported adjusted earnings of $1.53 per share in the last reported quarter, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.46 and increased 7% on a year-over-year basis. The stock has delivered positive earnings surprises in the past four quarters, at an average of 4.05%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to the fourth-quarter earnings announcement.Factors at PlayStrong Outlook: Management at Cardinal Health is bullish about significant cash generation in the fourth quarter. Furthermore, the company’s Cordis business is expected to generate accretive returns in the quarter.We note that despite solid commercial momentum on a global basis, the Cordis segment generated sluggish returns in the last reported quarter. However, in the fourth quarter, Cardinal Health is expected to leverage on the Patient Recovery business in the Cordis profile.Meanwhile, Cardinal Health reaffirmed the fiscal 2017 guidance range for adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations at $5.35–$5.50. The outlook represents growth of approximately 2–5% from the prior fiscal.Pricing Pressure in Generics Portfolio: Cardinal Health has been grappling with pricing deflation in the generics segment for long. Per management, reimbursement pressure is likely to affect the company’s customer base and also impede generic launches in the near term.Incremental expenses, specifically in the Pharma segment, might dent profits in the fourth quarter.Cutthroat Competition in Niche Space: Cardinal Health faces tough competition in each of its business segments. For example, its pharmaceutical supply chain business faces competition from McKesson and AmerisourceBergen as well as several smaller medical-surgical distributors such as Henry Schein and Owens & Minor. Intensifying competition in the global markets is likely to mar Cardinal Health’s top line in the fourth quarter.Estimate Revision Trend: The company’s estimate revision trend lacks luster. For the current quarter, one analyst moved south, compared to no upward revision in the last two months. Over the last three months, the current quarter estimates declined almost 6.5% to $1.24 per share, adding to our concerns.Cardinal Health, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Cardinal Health, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Cardinal Health, Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Cardinal Health is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat estimates. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP:The Earnings ESP for Cardinal Health is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.24. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Cardinal Health currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s unfavorable ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few companies you may want to consider as our proven model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Genomic Health Inc. (GHDX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +16.67% and a Zacks Rank #3.

2299,PFE,"Last week, several pharma majors reported second quarter results. Meanwhile, important study data was released by Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report).Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesA Look at Q2 Earnings Results: Big pharma companies like Merck, Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report), Glaxo, Roche, Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) and AstraZeneca reported second quarter results last week. Bristol-Myers, Lilly and Merck all beat expectations. While Merck maintained its outlook for the year (Read more: Merck Beats on Q2 Earnings and Sales, Keeps 2017 View), Bristol-Myers updated the same (Read more: Bristol-Myers Beats on Q2 Earnings, Tweaks 2017 View). Lilly was hit by its baricitinib update despite reporting a “beat and raise” quarter (Read more: Key Takeaways from Lilly's Q2 Call: Baricitinib, Cancer Pipeline). Meanwhile, AstraZeneca’s results were over-shadowed by disappointing MYSTIC data on Imfinzi in treatment-naïve non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with the company’s shares falling 14.9% (Read more: AstraZeneca Beats on Q2 Earnings, Falls on Failed Study).British drugmaker Glaxo set out new priorities for the company with the company deciding to allocate 80% of capital to priority assets in two current (respiratory and HIV/infectious diseases) and two potential (oncology and immuno-inflammation) therapy areas. Glaxo also said that more than 30 pre-clinical and clinical programs will be stopped (Read more: GlaxoSmithKline Beats on Q2 Earnings, Lowers Guidance).Lilly and Merck are both Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Merck’s Keytruda Misses Endpoint in HNSCC Study: There were a lot of updates from Merck last week in addition to the earnings results. The company was hit by disappointing results from a late-stage study evaluating its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, as a monotherapy in patients with previously treated recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The study failed to meet the pre-specified primary endpoint of overall survival (OS). This is the latest Keytruda-related setback for Merck. Earlier this month, the company had announced that the FDA has placed a clinical hold on three combination studies (KEYNOTE-183, KEYNOTE-185 and KEYNOTE-023) being conducted with Keytruda for multiple myeloma (MM).Meanwhile, a look at Merck’s second quarter results shows that Keytruda remains strong in the lung cancer setting. Keytruda is currently in more than 550 studies including more than 300 combination studies.Merck-AstraZeneca Sign Oncology Collaboration: Merck and AstraZeneca will be collaborating for the global development and commercialization of Merck’s Keytruda and AstraZeneca’s PARP inhibitor Lynparza for different types of cancer. Lynparza, currently approved for BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer in multiple lines of treatment, is in different studies for a range of tumor types including breast, prostate and pancreatic cancers. The deal will cover the evaluation of PARP and MEK inhibitors with PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitors. AstraZeneca stands to receive up to $8.5 billion including an upfront payment of $1.6 billion, $750 million for certain license options and up to an additional $6.15 billion on the achievement of regulatory and sales milestones.Merck stock has gained 8.9% year to date (YTD), lagging the 10.5% rally of the industry it belongs to while AstraZeneca has gained 10.8% YTD.J&J’s Janssen Inks Deal with Bavarian Nordic: Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies and Denmark-based biotech company Bavarian Nordic entered into an additional worldwide exclusive license and collaboration agreement under which Janssen will get exclusive rights to Bavarian Nordic’s MVA-BN technology for two additional programs targeting vaccines against hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HIV-1.J&J will make an upfront payment of $10 million and an equity investment worth $33 million. Bavarian Nordic will also be eligible to receive milestone payments worth up to $836 million plus tiered royalties on future sales.With this deal, the companies are now collaborating for four programs combining Bavarian Nordic’s MVA-BN technology with Janssen’s AdVac technology platform.Pfizer-Astellas’ Xtandi Breast Cancer Program Dropped: Astellas, which reported results last week, provided an update on its pipeline which showed that the company and its partner, Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), have decided to drop the development of Xtandi for breast cancer. The development program included a phase III study for triple negative breast cancer and a phase II study for ER/PR positive, HER2 positive breast cancer. Astellas said that the decision was based on discussions with Pfizer, the change in the competitive landscape, need for further diagnostic development and new phase II data.Ongoing programs for Xtandi include non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (phase III), prostate cancer in patients with non-metastatic biochemical recurrence (phase III), metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (phase III) and hepatocellular cancer (phase II).PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index declined 1.8% over the last five trading sessions. Among major stocks, Merck was up 2.4% while AstraZeneca lost 11.1%. Over the last six months, J&J was up 17.8% while Bristol-Myers gained 17.4% (See the last pharma stock roundup here: J&J, NVS' Q2 Earnings, Merck Drug Gets Tentative FDA Nod).What's Next in the Pharma World?Watch out for second quarter earnings results from companies like Pfizer, Shire (SHPG  -  Free Report) and Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) among others. Moreover, the FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee will be meeting on Aug 2 to discuss J&J’s regulatory application for its investigational rheumatoid arthritis treatment, Plivensia (sirukumab).More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like RunDid you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

2300,PFE,"We expect Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 1, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.99%.The pharma giant has a mixed record of earnings surprises. The company’s earnings surpassed expectations in two of the last four quarters while missing in the other two, resulting in an average negative surprise of 0.35%.Pfizer’s shares rose 1.9% this year so far, comparing unfavorably with an increase of 11.8% for the Zacks classified industry.Factors at PlayNew products like Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis) and Ibrance (breast cancer) as well as older products like Lyrica (neuropathic pain) and Eliquis (blood thinner) are likely to contribute to the top line meaningfully. Xeljanz (5 mg taken twice daily) was approved in the EU in Mar 2017, which may boost the drug’s sales in the to-be reported quarter.Also, revenues from the blockbuster prostate cancer drug Xtandi, added to Pfizer’s portfolio following the Sep 2016 Medivation acquisition, are likely to propel U.S. revenues.The Hospira acquisition is expected to be an important growth driver as well.Also, Pfizer launched Inflectra, a biosimilar version of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug Remicade in Nov 2016. Inflectra recorded sales of $17 million in the U.S. and $78 million globally in the first quarter. The biosimilar may generate more sales in the soon-to-be reported quarter.However, Pfizer will continue to face headwinds in the form of loss of exclusivity on key products like Pristiq, Zyvox and Celebrex and the expiration of a few co-promotion agreements, which will continue to hamper top-line growth. Blockbuster drug Enbrel sales will continue to decline in the quarter due to biosimilar competition. The Prevnar/Prevenar 13 vaccines franchise is expected to continue to see lower sales while lower demand should continue to hurt sales of Viagra.Meanwhile, the bottom line should be driven by cost savings and share buybacks. However, new product launch expenses and R&D investments are expected to hurt profits.On the second-quarter call, investor focus is expected to remain on the performance of new products and pipeline progress including biosimilars and immuno-oncology. Importantly, key cancer candidate, Bavencio/avelumab received FDA approval for metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in Mar 2017 and for advanced bladder cancer in May. The drug may bring in some revenues in the second quarter. Management is expected to shed light on how the launch is progressing at the conference call.Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) candidate, Besponsa, was also approved in the EU in late Jun 2017. We expect management to comment on the commercialization plans at the conference call.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model shows that Pfizer is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate (66 cents per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (65 cents per share), is +1.54%. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Pfizer has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Pfizer’s Zacks Rank #3 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderA couple of stocks in the pharmaceuticals sector that also have a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are:Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO  -  Free Report), scheduled to release results on Aug 9, has an Earnings ESP of +3.57% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +0.62% and a Zacks Rank #3.

By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

2301,PFE,"Yesterday, big pharma player, Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected second quarter results and raised its outlook for the year. However, shares were down 3% with investors focusing on the company’s update regarding its investigational rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, baricitinib.Here is a look at a few key takeaways from Lilly’s conference call.How Did Key Drugs Perform?Lilly’s second quarter 2017 revenues increased 8% from the year-ago quarter to $5.8 billion, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.6 billion. New products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Jardiance, Lartruvo and Cyramza performed well and drove volume growth. Late life cycle products like Cialis and Forteo drove price growth.Alimta continued to face significant competitive headwinds while Zyprexa, Cymbalta, Evista, Strattera and Axiron were impacted by loss of exclusivity. Cialis was also affected by lower volume in the U.S. reflecting a decline in the overall erectile disorder (ED) market as well as the presence of generics.Animal health revenue declined during the quarter reflecting market access pressure and competitive pressure in cattle and swine (Read more: Lilly Q2 Earnings Top, Baricitinib Re-Filing Delayed).Baricitinib Facing Significant DelayLilly announced that there will be a delay of at least 18 months in the resubmission of the regulatory application for baricitinib, which is being developed in collaboration with Incyte (INCY  -  Free Report). This means the resubmission will not take place this year.The FDA had issued a complete response letter (CRL) for baricitinib earlier this year in April. At that time, the agency had told the companies that it is unable to approve baricitinib, a once-daily oral medication for the treatment of moderate-to-severe RA, in its current form. The FDA had asked for additional clinical data to determine the most appropriate doses as well as to further characterize safety concerns across treatment arms.Although Lilly disagrees with the FDA's conclusions and believes the comprehensive clinical data supports a positive benefit-risk profile, the company will enter into discussions with the FDA to determine the kind of study needed to better define the benefit-risk profile of baricitinib.Meanwhile, Lilly and Incyte have plans to explore baricitinib for other indications with a late-stage study in psoriatic arthritis slated to commence next year while studies in atopic dermatitis and lupus continue. Phase II atopic dermatitis data will be presented at a scientific forum by year end.We note that baricitinib was approved in the EU under the trade name Olumiant in Feb 2017. The European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recently agreed that the label should be updated to include a precaution for patients who have risk factors for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Oncology R&D StrategyLilly provided an in-depth look at its oncology R&D strategy. The company’s strategy involves building on key treatments like Cyramza, Lartruvo and abemaciclib as foundational agents while it will focus on developing new standard-of-care changing therapies that clear a very high bar and will span a variety of mechanisms including immune-oncology. For now, Lilly will focus on seven candidates for priority internal development and three additional candidates (Ang2 MAb, CSF1R MAb and merestinib) with study data pending. The rest of the molecules in the pipeline will be partnered.The seven molecules that have made it to Lilly’s priority development list include abemaciclib which is already under FDA review, TIM-3 MAb, PD-L1 MAb, Erk 1/2 inhibitor, TGFb RI KI, PI3/mTOR inhibitor and prexasertib. About 10 molecules are earmarked for external or partnered development -- while three of these assets are owned by third parties, Lilly is looking for partners for the remaining seven -- a FGFR-3 ADC, ralimetinib, a FGFR inhibitor, a notch inhibitor, galunisertib, a CXCR4 peptide antagonist and emibetuzumab.Bottom LineAlthough Lilly delivered a “beat and raise” quarter, the company’s results got overshadowed by the baricitinib update. Investors were disappointed by the delay in the resubmission of the baricitinib regulatory filing in the U.S. with the company saying that there could be a minimum delay of 18 months. With several products facing generic competition and competitive pressure increasing, Lilly needs to focus on bringing new products to market. The company’s decision to prioritize its oncology pipeline makes sense. Lilly is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock -- you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Year-to-date, Lilly’s shares have gained 11.8%, just about topping the industry’s 11.2% rally.Watch out for earnings reports from other large cap pharma companies like Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report). Merck, a Zacks Rank #2 stock has a pretty good earnings track record having surpassed expectations in each of the last four quarters with an average surprise of 4.36%. Merck will be reporting Q2 results on Jul 28.Pfizer’s track record is mixed with the company topping expectations in two of the last four quarters. Pfizer, which will be reporting on Aug 1, has a positive Earnings ESP of 1.54% for the second quarter.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

2302,PFE,"Merck KGaA  is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 earnings results on Aug 3.Merck KGaA’s share price has increased 10% year to date, while the industry gained 6.3%.The company reports results under three business sectors – Healthcare, Life Science and Performance Materials.Strong performance at Life Science, which was the catalyst behind sales growth in the last few quarters, is anticipated to continue in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. However, sales at the Healthcare division were disappointing last quarter with only cancer drug, Erbitux registering sales growth. The Mar 2017 recommendation from National Institute for Health and Care Excellence for Erbitux’s use in combination with either Folfiri or Folfox as a first-line treatment for patients with RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer in the UK is expected to boost sales.However, competitive pressure and price reduction are expected to hurt sales of infertility drug, Gonal-f. Meanwhile, a year-over-year weakening of euro against dollar is expected to positively impact total sales for the company.In Mar 2017, the company received approval for Bavencio for the treatment of metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) followed by approval for advanced bladder cancer in May 2017 in the U.S.. The drug may bring in some sales this quarter. Moreover, the company is developing the drug in partnership with Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) for several cancer indications.Subsequent to the quarter, the company received a positive opinion from Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) for Bavencio in July as a monotherapy in adult mMCC patients. We expect management to shed light on commercialization plans for Bavencio at the earnings call.Merck KGaA, in Apr 2017 announced an agreement to divest its biosimilars business to Fresenius, as part of the company’s strategy to focus on its pipeline of innovative medicines. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2017.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a couple of health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements – a positive Zacks Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – to post an earnings beat this quarter.

2303,PFE,"Despite the hurdles in Trump’s plans to repeal and replace Obamacare, healthcare is the second best performing sector this year lagging technology. The optimism comes especially from encouraging industry trends and hopes of a favorable policy environment.The Trump administration plans to focus on easing regulatory hurdles rather than lowering drug prices, and expedite new drug approvals. Additionally, the shift in investors’ sentiment to defensive sectors like healthcare, which generally outperform during periods of low-to-moderate growth and rising geopolitical uncertainty, has led to a rally in healthcare stocks (read: Top Ranked Healthcare ETFs for Long Term Investors).As such, popular funds – Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV  -  Free Report), Vanguard Health Care ETF (VHT  -  Free Report), iShares U.S. Healthcare ETF (IYH  -  Free Report) and Fidelity MSCI Health Care Index ETF (FHLC  -  Free Report) – have gained at least 18% so far this year.
