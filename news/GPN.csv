15,GPN,"Rising interest rates aren't bothering Joseph Eberhardy, a manager of Wells Fargo Growth Fund (SGRAX), so maybe they should not scare you either. Instead, rising rates have whetted investors' appetites for quality growth stocks vs. defensive, dividend paying stocks in general, Eberhardy says.And history has taught Eberhardy and lead manager Tom Ognar that as long as the 10-year Treasury rate stays below 5%, leading growth stocks are safe. That bodes well in general for top holdings like Paycom Software (PAYC), Netflix (NFLX), Splunk (SPLK), Amazom.com (AMZN), PayPal (PYPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) that continue to drive the $4.7 billion portfolio's returns.""My gut says (the hindrance threshold for growth stocks) may be something less than 5% this time around, but we're not overly concerned with rates now around 3%,"" Eberhardy said.Going into Wednesday, those stocks were up this year 2% for PayPal to 60% for Netflix. Still, in the always-fluid mix of the market, the Eberhardy-Ognar team is hedging its bet on one of those leaders. (Lower in this story, we explain which one and why.)Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

So far this year the fund's 5.28% advance tops 88% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. and outstrips the S&P 500's 0.9% setback. Over the past 12 months the fund is up 24.23% vs. 18.56% on average for its direct rivals and 13.17% for the broad market benchmark.Key trends trump rising rates for Eberhardy. Growth stocks that Eberhardy and Ognar like the most are those with a tailwind from key secular trends. One such trend is the migration toward software as a service (SaaS). An example is Paycom, a provider of cloud-based human capital management software.But the fund has made big trims in Paycom in recent disclosures. ""Valuation was the key component for our trimming Paycom, as we thought the gap between our expectations and the market's expectations narrowed significantly,"" Eberhardy said.Paycom is trading at roughly 10 times its calendar 2019 enterprise value to sales ratio. ServiceNow (NOW) is a SaaS stock that the fund likes more. ""We like NOW better,"" Eberhardy said. With its slightly lower valuation of calendar 2019 nine times EV to sales ratio, ""we see a little more opportunity for margin expansion with NOW as they accelerate new investments into areas like HR,"" he said.The rise of cloud computing and storage is another trend the fund plays. Splunk is a hybrid play in cloud computing and SaaS, Eberhardy says. This company's software helps customers crunch big data, ""whether it's real-time monitoring for cybersecruity or helping locomotive operators optimize their driving to cut fuel costs,"" he said.Amazon is a long-time top holding and the poster child for a company capitalizing on the growth of online retail. ""They are the dominant provider in that space, and we see that continuing going forward,"" Eberhardy said. ""They also fit the cloud computing trend through their web services side. AWS (Amazon Web Services) is roughly 10% of their revenues but 90% of their total operating income.""PayPal is a leader in the digital payments trend. ""The shift from paper to digital payments benefits them, Global Payments (GPN) and Square (SQ), Eberhardy said, citing two additional holdings. ""We still feel that there's a big opportunity for all of them. PayPal stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries.""A fifth trend the fund aims to exploit is the rise of the Internet of Things. Chipmaker Nvidia is one way to play that trend. ""Whether it's on the gaming side or in autonomous vehicles, Nvidia is the clear leader,"" Eberhardy said. ""Nvidia has been the dominant provider of chips in those two spaces. Their lead, their competitive moat, is relatively stable.""Of course no stock or sector rises forever, Eberhardy cautions. ""There's still lots of opportunities in those five areas,"" he said, referring to the five trends. ""But some areas in particular, like SaaS in the last few months, have been trading toward the high end of their historical valuation ranges. That's something to watch. The other four are more fairly valued. To a lesser extent, cloud computing is closer to its higher end than its lower end.""YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Want Tax-Free Retirement Income?

26,GPN,"Fidelity Investments' plan is that shareholders of Growth Discovery Fund (FDSVX) will find their usual satisfaction in the first five or so months of the year. In that span, Asher Anolic will temporarily take the helm from marquee manager Jason Weiner, who will spend that period away from the fund on a leave of absence, traveling with his family and pursuing educational opportunities.X Anolic will be the acting manager not only of the $1.7 billion Growth Discovery but also of its advisor-sold twin, $3.1 billion Advisor Equity Growth (FAEGX).For Anolic, the challenge is weighty. Weiner, who has steered the funds since February 2007 and early November of 2006 respectively, has led them to rarefied success.The funds outperformed the broad market in the form of the S&P 500 in the latest calendar year, 2017, as well as the three and five years ended Dec. 31. If the funds keep up that pace and add outperformance over the past 10 years, they will earn inclusion as IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards winners. Only 4% of U.S. diversified stock mutual funds with at least $100 million in assets pulled off that feat by the end of 2016.Weiner — with Anolic as co-manager since July 1 — achieved that multiperiod outperformance with portfolios featuring leading stocks like Five Below (FIVE), Red Hat (RHT) and Alibaba Group (BABA), as well as household names like Facebook (FB)  and Amazon.com (AMZN), two of the FANG stocks.Shortly before 48-year-old Weiner began his sabbatical, he and 39-year-old Anolic talked with IBD from their Boston offices about their managerial juggling act and how their investment styles overlap and how they differ.IBD: Jason, has your management style changed since Asher joined you as co-manager?Weiner: Absolutely, yes. Any time you take on a partner, you talk about what you think, what your partner thinks. Ash came with experience in health care and staples, and with a much sharper quantitative investment focus. No two people have the same skill set. So one plus one equals more than two.IBD: Asher, have you changed?Anolic: With my background in staples and health care and financials, I never had a chance to encounter some of the big open-ended growth stories that Jason has done an excellent job figuring out. Those companies can have huge addressable markets, which become multiples of what people think they are today.In the past, I would have shied away from those because I was afraid of getting caught in something that I wasn't able to visualize where it could go. Jason's been great helping me out there.IBD: Since before the 2016 elections, the fund has swung toward cyclical stocks, then growth stocks, then back to cyclicals. How has that worked for the fund?Weiner: In 2016 growth didn't perform well and we didn't get paid for owning them. We got it all back in 2017 for the first three-quarters of the year. In the last quarter those leadership names took a breather. But I think it's healthy because we don't want a bubble.We stuck with growth. Now our job is to look forward into 2018 and figure out how to extend the process. No matter what the short-term gyrations are, how do we stick with names that are growing earnings and adding value?IBD: What's been the biggest change in the market during your career, Jason?Weiner: When I started at Fidelity in 1991, I was a junior analyst picking small-cap names. There was an inherent advantage because small companies were where you found little trees that grew into big trees.Today, it's completely the opposite. The only companies growing fast are the biggest companies in the world, companies with market caps of $500 billion. That's really driven by internet economics. This is very different, very unique.IBD: And you still look for the best growth opportunities, with an overlay of valuation sensitivity?Weiner: That hasn't changed. We look for undervalued growth stories and stocks with the potential for price-to-earnings (P/E) expansion, while avoiding names that have unreasonably high valuations or deteriorating business fundamentals.IBD: Asher, what changes will you make while Jason is out?Anolic: Aside from the fact that I don't love the decor (which drew laughter from both Anolic and Weiner), I expect changes in less than a quarter of the holdings. Jason has constructed the portfolio with a two-year horizon. We've tested lots of what-if scenarios. Nothing should surprise us. If something does crop up out of left field, I will adjust. But the fundamental approach will not change.IBD: Does Facebook still meet your valuation check box?Weiner: It's valuation is a lot higher than a year ago. It occurred because they grew fast. Earnings went up. They're touching 1 billion people a day with News Feed, their main product. You can sell a lot of advertising when you touch over 1 billion people a day.I still think they will improve their ad targeting. So fundamentals are intact. Can I find better value elsewhere (in another stock)? That search goes on every day. After the big move in these (internet) names in the last year, that conversation is a little more intense.IBD: With Amazon, you're comfortable that their spending will pay off within a reasonable period?Weiner: If you say retail as we knew it is dead and the retail of tomorrow is being invented as we speak, which companies are at the forefront? It is Alibaba and Amazon.We like to take a company's profit-and-loss statement and break down the business units. For Amazon, it's domestic retail and international retail and Amazon Web Services. How is each performing? What are their opportunities? With the investments they make, what will future earnings be like?IBD: Asher, what would you add?Anolic: AWS is cost intensive, more than the rest of Amazon. But it has taken a ton of market share, and has good margins and good cash flow. It's at the forefront of a major technological shift.IBD: Any more thoughts about Alibaba?Weiner: I look at Amazon and Alibaba as a pair. You want to distill the thoughts of Alibaba's Jack Ma (founder and executive chairman) and Amazon's Jeffrey Bezos (founder, chairman and CEO)? Looking at them together is helpful to understanding what those visionaries are doing. Just one part of that is inventing a new world of retail.IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news and analysis of Chinese stocks, visit IBD's special section about Chinese stocks to buy and watch.IBD: Does Five Below defy the problems of many brick-and-mortar retailers by discounting and by focusing on a teen audience?Weiner: It's too small to worry about, but I will tell you this: It's like Dollar Tree (DLTR) plus a treasure-hunt thing. Mom can bring her kids, who go to the $5 basketballs while mom goes to the $5 makeup aisle. I remember the CEO saying once, ""This is the only store where you can bring your kids and not have any fears.""IBD: Red Hat is the top provider of open-source Linux software for corporate data centers. Is that like being the top buggy-whip maker?Anolic: With the move to the cloud, people are worried about Red Hat's growth prospects. If you have a Linux operating system for several servers, but then you move a lot of that data to AWS or Google Cloud or Microsoft (Azure), you don't need all of those servers or that operating system.But Red Hat's core Linux business is still fantastic. Much in the cloud runs on Linux. And Red Hat is reinventing its business. They have a new product that can write programs on top of the Red Hat system and port them to different clouds. It gives CIOs the flexibility of not getting locked in to one cloud vendor. This gives some visibility to how Red Hat looks in a cloud environment. We're going to keep monitoring it. It's a fascinating solution.IBD: What business hasn't been totally disrupted, but could be eventually?Weiner: Digital payments. Payments in general have entrenched players like Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) and card-issuing banks like Citi (C) and JPMorgan (JPM) and merchant acquirers like First Data (FDC) and Global Payments (GPN). That system has been built over decades.But PayPal has given us a taste of disruption. We've all used PayPal at checkout. Can they take that beachhead and expand into the payment space? They've already got Venmo in people-to-people payments. And they own Braintree, which (provides mobile and web payments acceptance and processing for) merchants. (The payments space) feels ripe for disruption.IBD: Why do you like Copart (CPRT)?Weiner: It's a duopoly (with KAR Auction Services (KAR)), a great business. Hurricane Irma rolls through (the Caribbean and) Florida, Harvey hits Houston, and 100,000 cars get wrecked. They get disposed of through auto auctions. Copart is family run, has super profitability and super acquisitions. When cars get totaled, sometimes the scrap value is higher than a resale value.IBD: Asher, you're continuing to run $784 million Select Pharmaceuticals (FPHAX). What's the biggest change in joining Jason at the helm of Growth Discovery?Anolic: Jason has been helpful in teaching and generous with his time. So I'm totally up to speed on what is needed. And we worked together before I was named co-manager, so I was familiar with how he runs money.The biggest change is moving from one sector to the whole market. Six months of partnering doesn't teach you everything that someone running for 20-plus years has learned. But the skill set I've built allows me to understand day-to-day market moves and how to learn as I go.IBD: Jason, was Asher's apprenticeship long enough?Weiner: Asher is an experienced investor. And the way the fund (Growth Discovery) is built, 70% of its assets are in the top 40 names, so Asher only has to learn about 40 names to understand nearly three-quarters of the portfolio. Also, Asher already knew some names from his work on other mutual funds. And we have a huge amount of research support.IBD: Jason, will you be able to hit the ground running when you return in May or so?Weiner: I think I'll be raring to go. I'll have had a nice break, but it will be nice to get back to business.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:2018 Stock Market Forecast: Smaller Price Gains, With A Foreign TiltHot Fidelity Fund Owns Stocks Like Tencent That Jumped Friday

32,GPN,"The S&P 500 index and other major averages edged lower through Thursday as tax reform concerns weighted on the market. Snapchat parent Snap (SNAP) crashed on weak revenue and user growth. As for M&A, Broadcom (AVGO) made a $130 billion bid for fellow Apple (AAPL) supplier Qualcomm (QCOM), while reports surfaced that Walt Disney had held talks to buy much of 21st Century Fox (FOXA).The S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow industrials gave up weekly gains on fears that tax cuts would be delayed, closing slightly lower but still near record highs. Earnings remained heavy, with Nvidia (NVDA) leading chip earnings. Roku (ROKU) streamed higher on its strong, first-ever earnings report while fellow recent IPOs Snap and The Trade Desk (TTD) crashed. Bank stocks were notable losers for the week. Crude oil futures hit a 2-year high amid Saudi turmoil, but U.S. production hit record highs.Broadcom (AVGO) launched an unsolicited bid to buy wireless-chip maker Qualcomm (QCOM) in a deal worth $130 billion, which would make it the largest technology acquisition ever. Qualcomm is likely to reject the $70-a-share offer on the basis that it's too low. A deal also would have big antitrust hurdles. Qualcomm rose 4.5% to 64.57 after spiking nearly 13% on Nov. 3 as deal reports first hit. Broadcom retreated 3.2% but stayed in a buy range.Chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA), Microchip Technology (MCHP) and ON Semiconductor (ON) posted beat-and-raise quarterly reports. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) beat Wall Street's targets for the September quarter, but gave in-line guidance. Among chip-gear makers, Brooks Automation (BRKS) beat fiscal fourth-quarter forecast and guided current-quarter forecasts higher, but shares still tumbled Thursday and Friday following the results.Roku (ROKU) rocketed 55% Thursday after the streaming video firm reported much better-than-expected results for the third quarter, its first as a publicly traded company. Roku then rose to a record high Friday. Roku ended the third quarter with 16.7 million active users on its content distribution platform, up 48% year over year. Average revenue per user grew 37% year over year to $12.68. Roku makes hardware and software for accessing internet video services like Netflix (NFLX), Hulu and Amazon (AMZN) Prime Video.Analysts tore into Snapchat-owner Snap (SNAP) after a third-quarter earnings report that missed estimates on many metrics, including revenue and user growth. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel acknowledged complaints that Snapchat is ""hard to use"" and said that the app will be redesigned. Shares crashed 16%, even with Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) buying a 12% stake in the social media firm.RELATED:Snap Slammed On Quarterly Results As Tencent Acquires A StakeThree China internet companies, Sina (SINA), Weibo (WB) and Autohome (ATHM), all reported quarterly results that beat expectations.

Shares rose to 13.51 in Thursday's debut and closed Friday at 13.86. China-based Sohu (SOHU), an internet service company that includes gaming, holds the largest stake in Sogou, which is also backed by Tencent (TCEHY). Tencent leads China's messaging services field and aims to deepen its relationship with Sogou, posing a threat to China search-engine leader Baidu (BIDU).Nordstrom (JWN) roundly topped profit and revenue forecasts.

Meanwhile, reports surfaced that 21st Century Fox (FOXA) had held talks to sell the bulk of itself to Disney. Iger refused to address ""press speculation"" on the call.

37,GPN,"JPMorgan Mid Cap Growth Fund (HLGEX) has heated up this year thanks to leading-stock holdings like electronic parts maker Amphenol (APH), electronic payments processor Global Payments (GPN) and hotels-resorts-timeshares operator Hilton Worldwide (HLT). Their gains year to date range from 22% for Amphenol to 36% for Global.XAnd to help keep the good times rolling, the $3.2 billion fund is betting on top new buys as of its latest disclosure such as IPG Photonics (IPGP), a maker of fiber-optic lasers for industrial and medical applications; Linux operating system distributor Red Hat (RHT); and semiconductor test-equipment maker Teradyne (TER).Year-to-date gains by those newcomers ranged from 45% by Teradyne to 87% for IPG. On Tuesday, Red Hat gapped up 4% the day after reporting a 40% jump in adjusted fiscal second-quarter earnings per share, which topped analysts' expectations. It also raised its guidance for revenue and profit for the full year.The company's software runs computer servers in corporate data centers. Red Hat's cloud-computing revenue is mainly from customers using software-as-a-service.IBD'S TAKE: Red Hat is the No. 1 ranked stock in IBD's Computer Software-Desktop industry group.

Other popular premium offerings include exclusive stock lists and The Big Picture, a daily update of what's driving the market.For the fund, all of that good news translated into a 21.64% gain this year going into Thursday. That outperformed 87% of the fund's midcap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Direct and easily topped the S&P 500's 13.66% return.The fund produced a three-year average annual gain of 9.13% vs. the big-cap bogey's 10.43% pace and the fund peer group's 8.59%.One reason the three-year tempo lags year-to-date gain is the three-year average includes the fund's paltry 2016 gain of 0.19%, which lagged 91% of its direct rivals.That makes this year, so far, the poster child for the fund's approach, which aims for capital growth through midcap- stocks with above-average growth. As the fund's latest fact sheet puts it, the fund's managers seek companies that are industry leaders, with business models that hold up in a variety of markets and whose executives know how to steer their charges to outsized growth.Timothy Parton just notched his 13th anniversary at the helm of the fund. Felise Agranoff has been a manager for about a year and nine months.Take a closer look at some of the fund's leading stocks. Portfolio newcomer Teradyne has IBD's next-to-highest-possible Composite Rating of 98. Scored on a scale of 1 to 99, stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.The maker of automated test equipment for the chip industry also has an A SMR Rating, which means it is in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.The chip-testing systems firm serves the automobile, computing and game markets.In addition, Teradyne is in IBD's 85-85 index. The index tracks stocks whose EPS and Relative Strength Ratings are 85 or greater, and whose prices are above $15, are within 15% of their 52-week high and whose average daily trading volume is 10,000 shares or more.In July, the company's second-quarter report showed earnings per share up 64%. The 31% jump in revenue was the biggest jump in at least 19 quarters. Teradyne said results in the first half of the year were driven by strength in mobility, automotive, analog, microcontroller and memory end markets.Bright Horizons (BFAM) is another top new buy. Earnings per share growth has accelerated, having climbed 14%, 19%, 20% and 21% the past four quarters. The firm provides child care, early education and other services.It sports a 95 Comp Rating and an A SMR Rating.The rise in Q2 revenue and EPS growth was driven by both new full-service child-care centers and improved results from existing ones, the company said. Price increases averaged 3% to 4%. In addition, sales of backup dependent care and educational advisory services expanded.Fortive (FTV), a newcomer to the portfolio, makes equipment for testing and measurement, many for field instruments. EPS rose 13% and 11% the past two quarters, up from 1% the prior stanza.A spinoff from Danaher (DHR), Fortive was held by 1,388 mutual funds as of June 30.

41,GPN,"The stock market's ascent has slowed since June. But Wells Fargo Growth Fund's Tom Ognar sees a buying opportunity for the kinds of growth stocks his fund holds, which include PayPal (PYPL), Alibaba (BABA), Nvidia (NVDA) and Netflix (NFLX).X""The market has been a little more defensive, and it seems some higher multiple stocks have corrected a little — but nothing too discouraging,"" said Ognar, who is lead manager of $4.4 billion Growth Fund (SGRAX). ""To us, it opens opportunities. It has made many secular growth stocks more attractively valued.""Those are the kinds of stocks that Ognar and co-managers Bruce Olson and Joseph Eberhardy aim for and that have fueled the fund's long-term outperformance. ""The Growth Fund has always had a bias (in favor of) investing in longer-term secular growth companies that exhibit robust and sustainable growth,"" Ognar said. Many are built for vigorous growth in a variety of economic conditions.That focus has driven the fund in the long term. Ognar has been a manager of this portfolio since May 2002. Going into Thursday, over the past 15 years the fund's 11.53% average annual gain outpaced 93% of its peer group tracked by Morningstar Inc. and the big-cap bogey's 9.01% average yearly gain.This year the fund has tacked on an additional 22.16%, topping 80% of its direct rivals, despite a rocky past three months during which the fund beat only 43% of its peers.Olson has been a co-manager since the start of 2005. Eberhardy has been a manager since late April 2008.The recent downturn is certainly not the only time that the managers have added to names they like. They added to positions in recent quarters in several favorites, including PayPal, Alibaba, Nvidia and Netflix.PayPal benefits from the shift to electronic payments for transactions. That trend is driven by the need to make electronic payments for online transactions. It's also driven by global governments' desire to track transactions so they can assess taxes. The stock is a member of the IBD 50 list of stocks that have strong relative price strength and fundamentals.PayPal isn't the only holding that benefits from that trend. ""Square (SQ), Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), Global Payments (GPN) all benefit from the transition away from cash,"" Ognar said. ""The other big push for that (group) is the movement from offline, brick-and-mortar retailers to online retailers.""In addition, a change in PayPal's business strategy has cut a source of risk. ""PayPal has evolved its business model,"" Ognar said. ""It no longer fights with peers. It has made them more partners. It has signed partnerships with Visa and Mastercard, where it no longer creates barriers (for consumers) using Visa and Mastercard. Now it makes it easier for consumers to make payments through Visa and Mastercard using the PayPal platform.""Alibaba, China's leading online retail marketplace, benefits from the growth of online retail, the same trend that helps Amazon, Ognar notes, and it is diversifying geographically. ""We've felt there was an opportunity there since the (Alibaba) IPO,"" Ognar said.Both stocks are on Leaderboard — IBD's premium service that spotlights play-by-play of top stocks.A third trend that the fund plays is ""the digitization of the economy and consumer,"" Ognar said. He added, ""It's a compelling growth opportunity for semiconductor firms,"" Ognar said. Chipmaker Nvidia, which is another member of the IBD 50, benefits from the shift toward more use of graphics processing units, away from regular CPU computer chips, because of their faster processing speeds in applications such as gaming, driverless and driver-assisted cars, and cryptocurrencies, as well as machine learning and artificial intelligence.EPS grew at a triple-digit pace in four of the past five quarters.IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia is the No. 1 stock in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. It earned that spot in part by posting a 56% jump in sales last quarter and a 27.6% annual pretax margin. You can compare its other technical and fundamental strengths with its rivals' at IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.Portfolio newcomer Netflix is too small of a holding to be the poster child for any broad investment theme for the fund, Ognar says. Still, the stock popped 3.5% on Wednesday. IBD readers saw that the video-streaming service bounced off its 50-day moving average, rising toward a buy point.Among other holdings, Microchip Technology (MCHP) is another chipmaker that benefits from digitization of the economy and consumer. ""Electronics and digitization are influencing more of what we do and the products we use to do those things,"" Ognar said.Microchip Tech's products include signal microcontrollers. ""They're like little full-blown computers within thermostats in your home, the entertainment system of your car, or camera, or brake system of your car,"" he said.While the fund has trimmed its Microchip stake, the stock is still the fund's largest chipmaker. Shares are up 34% so far this year.The fund has trimmed stocks that have been big share-price gainers this year, including software titan Microsoft (MSFT) and video game publisher Activision Blizzard (ATVI), to reduce their weightings. ""It's more of a risk-management move as they've grown in position size, not because of a degradation in growth opportunities,"" Ognar said. RELATED:What's The Stock Market Doing Now?Are You A Newcomer To Stock Investing Who Wants A Few Pointers?

43,GPN,"Talk about hot! Brian Demain is lead manager of $14.2 billion Janus Henderson Enterprise (JANEX), which is an IBD 2017 Best Mutual Fund Awards winner. So is the fund's twin, $1 billion Aspen Enterprise (JAAGX), of which he also is skipper.XThe portfolios won Best Funds honors by outperforming the S&P 500 in four time periods ended Dec. 31 — the trailing one, three, five and 10 years.And they did so in not just one category but in three — diversified equity mutual funds, growth mutual funds and midcap mutual funds.That put them into a small group of gems. A mere 44 U.S. diversified stock mutual funds, out of 1,104 with assets of at least $100 million, prevailed as winners across those four time spans.Demain and Cody Wheaton run the funds with little turnover, just 20% now, according to Morningstar Inc. Among both portfolios' holdings are Crown Castle (CCI), Microchip Technology (MCHP), Global Payments (GPN), Sensata Technologies (ST) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD). All are either forming basing patterns or in buy ranges.Enterprise is open to investors who already own shares. It's also open to old or new shareholders in 401(k) plans that already offer the fund, as well as to old or new investor clients of a wirehouse brokerage that offers the identical strategy through a separately managed account. Twin sister Aspen Enterprise can be bought by old or new investors through some insurance companies.A midcap fund at Janus Henderson that is still open to new investors is $4 billion Mid Cap Value (JMIVX).Demain, who is 40 years old, talked about his investment approach and several key stock holdings in a recent interview with IBD:IBD: Brian, summarize your investment approach.Demain: First, we look for what we call sustainable growth. We want companies that are growth companies today and will be three, five, seven years from now. They may not be the fastest growers, but they can grow for the long term.Second, we're looking for companies with sustainably high returns on invested capital. It's great if a company can grow. But if it's not earning high returns on invested capital, it's not increasing shareholder value. So we try to understand a company's competitive advantage, because that's what will drive its long-term return on invested capital.Third, we care about the quality of a company's management team. We like management teams that focus on the right areas, and that are good leaders.If we find companies that meet those three criteria and we can buy them at attractive valuations and hold them for the long term, we can outperform our peers.IBD: The fund's performance is consistent, as shown by its being an IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards winner. Is the key its outperformance during up markets or during down markets?Demain: We've generally been able to keep up in up markets and outperform in down markets. We try to have a predicted beta (a measurement of volatility relative to the market or benchmark) against our Russell MidCap Growth Index benchmark of between 0.85 and 1, so we have less absolute risk than the benchmark. But it's higher than 0.85, because we don't want to only outperform in a down market. That's where we want to shine, but we do OK in up markets as well.IBD: Why do you like midcaps?Demain: They're not as mature as large caps, so they have real growth opportunities ahead of them. But their business models are more established than small caps'.Many have withstood competitive challenges, which small caps may not have. But they tend to be less volatile than small caps.IBD: You've got about 70% of your assets in the technology, industrials and health care sectors. Why do you expect to find so many opportunities in those spaces?Demain: With tech and health care, it is the power of innovation. In tech, we've been overweight in hardware and semiconductors. The mobile internet is driving semiconductor growth. And we're seeing a lot of innovation in software pushing itself into our lives.In health, we own biotechs, pharmaceuticals, life-science tools and diagnostic companies. Aging baby boomers and an emerging middle class globally are driving innovations in drug development and diagnostics.IBD: You've noted that corporate tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation may not occur as fast as many investors have hoped. How have you hedged your bets on those areas?Demain: Take tax cuts. Sensata is a Netherlands domiciled company (which makes sensors for aircraft, cars and other products) but it does business in the U.S. It pays a low tax rate because of where it is domiciled, so it will not benefit from lower U.S. rates.We also own TD Ameritrade (which is a brokerage). It pays a full tax rate, so if there's reform it will benefit. But policy changes can cut both ways. Ameritrade also benefits from rising interest rates. It sweeps clients' cash balances into TD Bank and earns more money on that spread as rates rise. And we own Crown Castle (a REIT that owns wireless cell towers). It has high levels of borrowing, so it will be hurt by high interest rates.IBD: Lam Research (LRCX) must be one of your semiconductor plays. Describe it, please.Demain: They are a semiconductor capital equipment manufacturer. In the last few years, we've gone from everything being etched on one plane of each microchip to effectively stacked layers on chips. So a lot of growth has gone to etching deposition players like Lam.In addition, demand in the memory market is robust. That's driven by uptake in solid-state drives. We're going from the old disk drives to solid-state flash-driven drives. That demands lots of chips, which is good for Lam.And we like their valuation. The stock trades at 13.5 times forward earnings. If you back out their cash, it is close to 12 times. The market's multiple is north of 18 times. And several high quality semiconductor companies are trading at 20 times.IBD: Celgene (CELG) is best known for Revlimid, its blood-cancer treatment. Do you like its other products?Demain: You're right, Revlimid is its workhorse and continues to grow due to longer treatment duration and finding new patients. But what do they do after Revlimid goes off-patent in 2026?The outlook for three other Celgene products — Pomalyst, Otezla and Abraxane — is constructive. And we're excited about its pipeline of new (treatments). Also, they've done business development deals with cash from Revlimid to build emerging franchises in gastroenterology and immunology, and inflammation and immunology. Those things should make the 2026 patent cliff for Revlimid a manageable event.IBD'S TAKE: Celgene is the No. 1 ranked stock in IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group, which is ranked a very strong No. 4 among 197 groups. Celgene earns its top-dog status thanks to such traits as a best-possible 99 Composite Rating from IBD and an annual pretax margin of 50.4, which is the highest it's been in at least nine years. Compare its other technical and fundamental strengths to its rivals' at IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.IBD: Microchip Technology's earnings per share growth has accelerated for six quarters in a row. Does your thesis revolve around the fact that their chips are used in a variety of products?Demain: The majority of their revenue is from microcontrollers, which are very simple computers that can go into all sorts of devices from airplanes to microwave ovens to kids' toys. That has great growth dynamics, which is a function of the growth of the Internet of Things. That's the company's sustainable growth.That business has a very fragmented customer base. You're not just selling a ton of chips to one customer like Apple (AAPL). You're selling to thousands of end markets. That's their competitive advantage.As for a good management team, the company is led by Steve Sanghi. We have high regard for his value creation. The company recently acquired Atmel, which was a large microcontroller competitor. It had good assets, but was poorly managed. Sanghi has improved operating margins and driven strong earnings growth. And valuation is not that demanding at about 15 times forward earnings.IBD: How does SS&C Technologies (SSNC) illustrate your investment approach?Demain: This is another example of sustainable growth plus competitive advantage plus strong management. SS&C provides back-office services for financial companies. As asset management matures, more companies want to focus on their core competencies. Rather than run back offices in-house, they look to outsource. And once they are embedded with a customer, other departments at the customer may outsource to them as well.SS&C is run by Bill Stone, who has a proven record of value creation. And their valuation is reasonable.IBD: Global Payments' earnings per share growth has sped up. Why?Demain: Think of Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) as electronic payment highways. Global Payments is the on- and offramp. They have relationships with merchants who accept credit card terminals. If you run a restaurant, for example, Global gives you software that not only accepts credit cards but also helps you run your restaurant. And Global has benefited from consolidation.IBD: What makes Heico (HEIA), which designs and repairs parts for aircraft and engines, attractive to you?Demain: Only certain approved suppliers can sell parts to airlines. Planes are in service for 25, 30 years, and need servicing. But only a relatively small number of companies have parts-manufacturing approval (PMA) from the Federal Aviation Administration and the European (regulatory) body. The FAA has (limited resources) and can only approve so many parts per year. Heico has the best position in the PMA market. They earn healthy margins.Also, the Mendelson family owns a large percentage of the company. It's most of their liquid net worth, so they care a lot about creating shareholder value, so we like to partner with them.IBD: What's driven the share-price uptrend by contact-lens developer Cooper (COO)?Demain: We like their sustainable growth. Contact lens are a growing category as contacts get more comfortable. They also benefit from international growth.There are only four players: Bausch & Lomb, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Alcon and Cooper. Once a consumer picks one, they usually stick with it and won't change because of a small price difference.IBD: Why is index operator MSCI attractive?Demain: The way to think about them is that they benefit from the growth of ETFs. An active manager like Janus Henderson pays a fixed fee for access to a benchmark operator. For MSCI, when a fee dollar moves from an active to a passive fund, that dollar becomes more profitable.And once you are a standard index, it is hard (for users) to change.IBD: By the way, any plans to reopen Enterprise Fund to all investors?Demain: No, we are managing $18 billion (including money in Aspen Enterprise and in separately managed accounts using Enterprise's strategy). It makes us one of the larger midcap strategies. Our first priority is working on behalf of existing clients. They think being closed is in their best interests and that's why we've done this.RELATED:Winning Mutual Fund Focuses On Leading Stocks Like Autohome, MarketAxess7 Steps For Millennials Who Want To Become Rich Retirees

""We think Amazon can substantially expand its reach by signing new merchants. However, we do not see Amazon as an imminent threat to PayPal or the card networks.""""The card networks face real threats from China and elsewhere, and will need to invest and partner aggressively (Apple (AAPL), Square, Klarna) to ensure that faster payments stay on their rails,"" the brokerage went on to say.Goldman Sachs says companies will be fighting over a $200 billion market.PayPal Holdings (PYPL), privately-held Stripe and Square (SQ) will be among the online payment industry's gainers, says Goldman Sachs.

PayPal is ranked No. 25 in the IBD 50 roster of fast-growing companies.""We believe traditional merchant acquirers will lose online payments share to acquirers like PayPal, Adyen, Stripe, and Wirecard who have more advanced technology solutions and who serve more online-first merchants,"" said the report. ""We believe merchant acquirers will continue consolidating in order to mitigate pricing pressure and sustain stock multiples.""Goldman Sachs is upbeat about PayPal, saying ""We think investors often see PayPal's market simply as e-commerce, but we think PayPal is positioned to seed growth in new markets.""""We see $28 trillion in online spending growing to $51 trillion over 10 years, driving $200 billion in new payments fee revenue,"" the report said.RELATED:Is The Holy Grail Of Digital Payments Just One Click Away?These 4 Top Stocks Are Soaring Into Buy Zones On EarningsArista Networks Smashes Estimates, Stock Soars After Hours

60,GPN,"Square's (SQ) opening to sell specialized software to small merchants is bigger than streetside estimates, says Pacific Crest Securities, which hiked its price target on the payment processor.Square stock ended the day down 1%, to 14.91, on the stock market today. Shares in San Francisco-based Square have gained 12% in 2017, having climbed in every trading session this year. Square stock has formed a cup-with-handle chart pattern.Square still is best known for its credit card readers that plug onto mobile phones and tablets, a boon for many smaller companies. But Square also has expanded into providing financing for small businesses, and its software helps with invoices, email marketing, sales analytics and more.Square's ""'semi-specialized' small- and medium-size software opportunity is underappreciated,"" said Josh Beck, a Pacific Crest analyst who upped his price target to 17 from 15. Barclays also raised its price target on Square to 17 from 15 on Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix and Broadcom, and nontechs such as Nucor, Burlington Stores and Martin Marietta, are among stocks on IBD's Leaderboard. Leaderboard follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping.""The SMB software market is the most fragmented with Vantive (VNTV), Total System Services (TSS) and Global Payments (GPN) as the leaders; First Data (FDC) is a relatively new entrant. The national category is dominated by the likes of NCR and Micros. Square's predominant segment, micro-merchant, is relatively underserved, in our view, which creates opportunity for SQ to compete.""Square went public at $9 per share in November 2015, but within three months it was trading just above 8, its all-time low. The payments field has become crowded, but Square has been striving to carve out its niche.""Net-net, we see the opportunity for $5 million to $50 million of a high-margin revenue opportunity,"" Beck said in the report. ""We are factoring in some degree of success with 'semi-specialized' software of about $10 million.""Square in November hiked its guidance and reported a narrower-than-expected third-quarter loss as revenue topped views.RELATED:Square Stock Gains On Apple Pay Mobile PartnershipSquare Upgraded On Expected 'Positive Fundamental Surprises'Square Q3 Tops, Hikes Outlook On Momentum With Larger Merchants

Small caps were particularly weak, with the Russell 2000 sinking 0.5%.Markets start the week on reasonably strong footing, with the Nasdaq up 2.6%, the S&P 500 holding a 1.7% gain and Dow industrials ahead 1% so far in January, all at or near new highs and working on a third straight monthly advance.  Markets will have an eye on Washington, where a Republican-controlled Senate will give some sense of its capability to move on matters of importance as it works to confirm the first of the Trump administration's Cabinet nominees.Despite the overall flat premarket tone, leading stocks Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Netflix (NFLX) and Nvidia (NVDA)  all edged higher in early trade.Apple rose 0.8% to 118.85, surpassing a 118.12 cup-with-handle entry.

62,GPN,"Here's your Investing Action Plan for Tuesday: what you need to know as an investor for the coming day. Visa (V), MasterCard (MA) and Global Payments (GPN) are getting their turn in the spotlight as the rally in bank stocks levels off. Top names in the consumer space like Dave & Buster's (PLAY) and Jack in the Box (JACK) will…
"
63,GPN,"Payment processors Visa (V), MasterCard (MA) and PayPal (PYPL) sold off sharply on Monday, breaking key technical levels.Visa shares fell 4.3% to 78.38 on Monday, losing sight of a tight consolidation in recent weeks near the 50-day line. That also undercuts an earlier buy point of 81.83. Visa did manage to close just above its 200-day moving average after falling below that support level intraday.MasterCard pulled back 3.3% to 101.14 on Monday, falling in heavy volume below its 50-day line. The stock is in danger of a round trip from a late September breakout, but for now is still above the 100.10 buy point.Visa and MasterCard rose modestly before the opening bell on the stock market today.PayPal, which recently announced alliances with Visa and MasterCard, sank 3.2% to 38.81 on Monday, closing just above the 200-day line after undercutting it intraday. PayPal broke out of a consolidation on Oct. 21, a day after reporting quarterly results, hitting a new high. But shares have been retreating since then, undercutting the pivot point earlier this month and closing below the 50-day line on Friday.PayPal was flat before Tuesday's opening bell.Global Payments (GPN) and Vantiv (VNTV) also have retreated.It's unclear what it is hurting Visa, MasterCard and PayPal. They make their money from transaction fees, letting card-issuing banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) get the risk and reward from customers' balances. With the yield curve steepening sharply in recent weeks and especially since Donald Trump became president-elect, card interest rates may rise. Bank stocks are soaring on widening yield spreads generally.IBD'S TAKE: While Visa and MasterCard slump, investors continue to rush into bank stocks. They're mostly extended from proper buy points, but you should pay close attention to this new leading group for entry points down the road.That could be why American Express (AXP), Capital One Financial (COF) and Discover Financial (DFS) are soaring. All three carry customers' balances. American Express rose 2.7% Monday to its best levels since November 2015. Capital One jumped 3.4% to its highest since July 2015. Discover Financial advanced 3.3%, hitting an all-time high intraday.Jefferies analysts said Tuesday that the sell-off in some payment stocks is unwarranted.""Major payments stocks including V, MA, PYPL, GPN and VNTV are off 5-10% in the four trading sessions since Election Day. We don't believe this is because of fundamental concerns on these stocks, but rather because of investor rotation into core Financials which have significantly lagged the payments stocks for years, but are now expected to benefit from rate and regulatory tailwinds under the Trump Administration.""Jefferies added that financial deregulation could repeal the Durbin limit on interchange fees and rein in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. ""If Trump's general plans for deregulating the financial services industry ends up including a repeal of the Durbin Amendment and a less-powerful CFPB, this should generally be a tailwind for the Payments industry, though impacts to PYPL/SQ/merchant acquirers may be less clear.""

90,GPN,"Falling fuel prices are great for vehicle-fleet operators but not so much for fuel-card firms that get a cut on sales when customers swipe their cards at the pump.FleetCor Technologies (FLT) is one of the biggest fuel-card companies in the U.S. And it has a sizeable international business, thanks to acquisitions of local fuel-card networks.The Norcross, Ga.-based firm generates revenue from its payments network and card processing services for commercial and government fleets.The company charges fees to fleet operators that use its various fuel cards and a usage fee to gasoline companies that take the fuel cards.FleetCor and analysts who follow the firm remain upbeat about its prospects in the face of lower fuel prices in the U.S.For one thing, FleetCor generates much of its revenue from services that have nothing to do with prices at the pump.In addition to various fees, FleetCor offers productivity tools, fraud protection and fleet-maintenance management, among other money-saving services.What's more, a wide spread between the wholesale price of fuel and the retail price offsets lower fuel prices — at least in the near-term. While wholesale prices react quickly to oil-price changes, retail prices tend to follow more slowly.Profit From Price SpreadsThe spread, for now, offsets some of the negative impact from declining gas prices, acting as a kind of hedge, analysts say.Eric Dey, FleetCor's chief financial officer, said in a post-Q3 conference call that higher fuel-spread margins lifted North American revenue by $5 million in the quarter.Analysts from Evercore ISI noted in a research report earlier this month that the average spread between wholesale and retail fuel prices in the fourth quarter grew 40% year over year.Given the wide spread and a decline in foreign exchange headwinds, Evercore raised its Q4 forecast by three cents a share, to $1.38. That's two cents above analysts' consensus of $1.36. In the year-earlier period, FleetCor earned $1.08.Barclays' analysts also don't seem too fazed by the impact of lower fuel prices on FleetCor's financial health. Barclays has an ""overweight"" on the stock, and it notes, ""Long-term prospects outweigh short-term headwinds.""""We suspect that during 2015, investors will look through the gas price and (foreign exchange) impacts and instead look at normalized growth potential,"" analyst Darrin Peller of Barclays wrote in late December.FleetCor shares rose 27% in 2014 but are down 8% so far this year, however.The company's ""normal"" growth has been impressive. Revenue over the last four years has grown 26% annually on average, while earnings have gone up 36% a year on average over that time.Numerous acquisitions have fueled some of FleetCor's growth. In Q3, the three biggest deals from 2013 — in the U.S., the U.K. and Brazil — accounted for about half of the company's revenue growth, CEO Ronald Clarke said in the last conference call.Total company revenue in the quarter jumped 31% to $295.3 million, while earnings per share rose 27% to $1.37.FleetCor has made more than 60 acquisitions since 2002. They include the recent $3.45 billion deal for Comdata, which closed in November and was its biggest buy ever.Comdata provides electronic fleet, virtual card and gift card solutions to more than 20,000 customers worldwide. Fleetcor management expects sizeable synergies, including cuts in fixed costs and cross-selling opportunities.Acquiring To GrowGoldman Sachs analysts see up to $1 billion of additional ""accretive"" deals this year.New acquisitions, organic growth and cost synergies from the Comdata deal ""will more than offset"" headwinds from weak fuel prices and negative foreign currency translations, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote after a meeting with management in mid-December.FleetCor's forecast for Q4 calls for earnings of $1.33 per share, assuming a foreign currency headwind of 5 cents. Analysts on average expect $1.36, according to a poll by Thomson Reuters.For all of 2014, FleetCor raised its EPS forecast to $5.07-$5.11 from $5.04-$5.10 previously. The company also raised its 2014 revenue forecast slightly, to $1.1-$1.11 billion.For 2015, management kept its previous guidance for EPS of $6.35 at the midpoint, despite an expected $.15-$.20 EPS headwind from unfavorable foreign exchange and lower U.S. fuel prices.The 2015 EPS guidance implies a 25% gain from FleetCor's expected EPS for 2014.The CFO noted in the call that the Comdata business — yet to be acquired then — was doing better than expected and that financing costs were lower than thought.FleetCor's revenue is almost evenly split between North America and international, with faster growing North America slightly higher at 52.9% of the mix.North America revenue in Q3 jumped 35.6% vs. the prior year to $156.3 million, with organic growth of 19%.Double-digit growth in the U.K. fueled much of the growth on the international side, which saw revenue rise 26.4% to $138.9 million.Even FleetCor's business in ailing Russia was ""hanging in there,"" CEO Clarke said in the call. He and other executives declined an interview request.Maine-based rival WEX (WEX), formerly Wright Express, saw Q3 revenue grow 16% to $222.1 million. Earnings rose 17% to $1.56 per share, but analysts expect Q4 earnings to fall 1% from a year earlier.Its shares have fallen off sharply since late November.In IBD rankings, FleetCor is rated higher than WEX, with a Composite Rating of 93 vs. WEX's 74. The highest score possible is 99. The ratings factor in several metrics such as earnings growth and stock gains.Both stocks are in IBD's Finance-Credit Card/Payment Processing industry group, which is ranked 83 of 197 groups in performance.FleetCor is No. 3 in the group by Composite Rating, after Vantiv (VNTV) and Alliance Data Systems (ADS). Other stocks rated above 90 are Global Payments (GPN), MasterCard (MA) and Euronet Worldwide (EEFT).

136,GPN,"Wine-and-beer giant Constellation Brands (STZ) and smart-lighting provider Acuity Brands (AYI) broke out past buy points Wednesday, while payment-processing and tech leader Global Payments (GPN) climbed closer to a buy point, after all three highly rated companies reported stellar quarterly results and bullish outlooks. Meanwhile, top-rated Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) shot up late on its strong results and guidance.The companies are cashing in on growing trends. For Constellation, it's the ever-growing interest in craft-everything that has disrupted big booze makers. For Acuity, it's the rising popularity of LED lighting and the Internet of Things. For Global Payments, it's the increasingly mobile, digital payments landscape in smaller businesses. For Ollie's Bargain Outlet, it's America's love of off-price, closeout merchandise.Constellation Brands, the parent of Mondavi wines and Corona beer, reported fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.19, up 15% and a nickel above estimates. Sales grew 14% to $1.54 billion, topping views for $1.52 billion. Beer organic net sales rose 18% during the quarter, while wine and spirits net sales rose 4% on a constant currency basis.The company also said that it was mulling an IPO for part of its Canadian wine business and announced the $285 million acquisition of “super luxury” winemaker Prisoner Wine from Huneeus Vintners. The purchase, set to close at the end of this month, follows Constellation's announced acquisition of craft beer company Ballast Point in November.For fiscal 2017, the beverage company anticipates $6.05-$6.35 on a comparable basis and $6-$6.30 on a reported basis. The midpoint tops expectations for $6.11.Shares punctured through a cup base with a 155.78 buy point, closing up 5.9% to 160.34.Meanwhile, Acuity Brands said that its second-quarter EPS had surged 53% to $1.80, beating an outlook for $1.51. Sales climbed 26% to $777.8 million, above analyst expectations of $752 million. Sales of LED-based items jumped more than 40%, accounting for roughly 55% of total sales.The results came despite Acuity's investments in its offerings in building management, the Internet of Things and other areas. The company said that it would continue to gain from demand for better lighting and connected, energy-conscious building management in the years to come.Acuity added that it was making good progress on some of its recent acquisitions. Those purchases will expand Acuity's operations in lighting, building automation and indoor building-navigation and analytics technology, which could be used in places like malls, colleges and airports.Acuity's stock catapulted past a 222.95 buy point of a cup-with-handle base, finishing at 254.85, up 13.3%.Strong results in Europe and North America helped lift Global Payments' Q3 results. EPS rose 17% to 70 cents, above views for 67 cents. Adjusted net revenue increased 6% to $497 million, above views for $493 million. Sales rose 11% on a constant-currency basis.The firm also bumped its full-year EPS forecast to $2.93-$3.00, up from $2.90-$3.00 and surpassing consensus. The brighter outlook comes despite a tough foreign-exchange environment.The company makes a lot of its money as a card-payments-processing intermediary between businesses and financial institutions. With its acquisition of Heartland Payment Systems (HPY), it hopes to expand its payment-technology offerings for smaller businesses. Global Payments Chief Executive Officer Jeff Sloan said, ""(We) look forward to closing the transaction later this month.”Global Payments gapped up 8.8% to 70.86, getting closer to a 74.74 buy point of a cup base. Heartland, meanwhile, jumped 4% to a record high.After the market close, Ollie's Bargain Outlet reported fiscal  fourth-quarter earnings of 31 cents a share excluding one-time items, beating analyst consensus by 3 cents a share, pushing  shares up late Wednesday.Sales rose 21% to $243.4 million, topping views for $239.1 million.The retail closeout chain guided sales for the current fiscal year ending Jan. 28, 2017, of $865 million to $875 million, with the midpoint below the consensus for $872.3 million. But it expects 83-85 cents EPS, vs. views for 76 cents.Ollie's stock rose 5.7% to 24 in after-hours action. Shares closed up 0.9% to 22.70 on the stock market today, retaking a 22.63 buy point. But the late stock action suggests Ollie's may move out of the buy range limit of 23.76.Elaine Low and James DeTar contributed to this articleImage provided by Shutterstock.

The new midpoint is above consensus views for $2.94, largely due to Q3's better-than-expected result.Third-quarter EPS rose 17% to 70 cents, topping expectations for 67 cents. Adjusted net revenue increased 6% to $497 million, above views for $493 million. Sales rose 11% on a constant-currency basis.Some 2 million locations across 29 countries use Global Payments' products. The company provides payment processing for merchants, serving as an intermediary between businesses and banks.Shares rose 8.8% to 70.86 on the stock market today, climbing their way through a cup base formed in December with a 74.74 buy point.That consolidation began after Global Payments announced plans to buy Heartland, potentially expanding Global's access in payment solutions for smaller businesses and in sectors as varied as education and correctional facilities. But there was some sense on the Street that Global Payments had paid too much.In its statement Wednesday, Global Payments' Chief Executive Officer Jeff Sloan said, ""We are delighted with the progress we have made on the partnership with Heartland Payment Systems and look forward to closing the transaction later this month.""As more people do business over phones or tablets, and e-commerce becomes the norm, the payments industry has tried to broaden its reach and become more digitally focused, often through acquisitions. Global Payments has expanded international support for Apple (AAPL) Pay, Alphabet (GOOGL) Android Pay and Samsung Pay in recent months.Total System Services (TSS), another payment processor, climbed 1.2%. Card giant Visa (V) advanced  1.6%, while MasterCard (MA) eked out a 0.4% gain.Apple rose 1.05% and Alphabet 1.25%.

161,GPN,"With Valentine's Day on Sunday, love is in the air, and if you're single, is probably poisoning it.But as couples lock down dinner reservations and gift orders, and single men cram for dates with books by Neil Strauss, here are five highly-rated IBD 50 companies that, in one way or another, could make for steamy investor relations: Facebook (FB), Global Payments (GPN), Michael Kors (KORS), Nike (NKE) and PayPal (PYPL).With oil prices diving and China's economy slowing, the prospect of a recession and credit-market contagion are on the minds of curious lovers everywhere. Let a strong company like Nike be your rock with its cash flow, solid dividend and share repurchase program, as it unlocks your passion with brand innovation.Cue the slow music and let the rose petals fall where they may as Jefferies finds the words:""Nike offers consistent cash flow and also a growth opportunity tied to continued success in China and emerging markets, and share gains for the brand and the sportswear category. While (analyst Edward Plank) likes the strong growth prospects for NKE outside of the core North America base and focus on capital returns to shareholders, he highlights Nike’s already dominant global market share in athletic footwear and competitive separation as contributing to consistent cash flow. Eddie anticipates new product innovation, driven by the 2016 Summer Olympics, will help to drive growth over the next year.""In that research note, released Friday, Jefferies cited Nike as among its picks with ""idiosyncratic growth and some degree of protection from a downturn.""The company could also become more involved with Apple (AAPL), whose Apple Watch has fitness-tracking capabilities.Shares of Nike closed down 1.3% for the week. Apple ended virtually flat.Nothing is more attractive than confidence, and analysts praised social media giant Facebook after its Q4 results last month soundly topped estimates, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company was ""thriving."" Facebook has grown through mobile and video ads and has broken into virtual reality through its Oculus Rift headset, with romantic implications that need not be mentioned here.But for those who will not be boldly exploring any new boundaries this weekend, Facebook at least has one feature (detailed in this press release) that allows you to reduce your exposure to your exes.Shares cleared a consolidation in the days following Facebook's report, but they fizzled afterward and are currently testing support at their 50-day line.Facebook finished 2% lower for the week.Maybe your significant other wants a new handbag. Well, Michael Kors sells lots of handbags. And their stock jumped 23.9% on Feb.2 following the release of view-topping holiday-quarter results, which were boosted luxury offerings and e-commerce.Jefferies, in a note last month, predicted a rebound in handbags' appeal, citing new spring trends and slowing shoe sales, leaving shoppers with more money potentially to buy crossbodies, mini-bags or ""bag-cessories.""Michael Kors shares lost 4.4% for the week, finding some love above their 200-day line after a long dry spell below it.Whatever you buy on Valentine's Day, payment processor Global Payments could help you seal the deal, indulging customers with robust support for Apple Pay and a product suite of online and brick-and-mortar payment-technology solutions across 29 countries.But no multibillion-dollar company can drift through this entropic world alone forever, especially as the payments landscape becomes more competitive with the rise of e-commerce. To that end, Global Payments in December announced the $4.3 billion acquisition of Heartland Payment Systems (HPY), allowing it to reach out to smaller and midsize businesses.Shares gained 1.9% for the week, but the stock has trended below its key 50-day and 200-day moving averages.Meanwhile, PayPal, which Jefferies also cited as a good growth stock for an uncertain time, has become a globally recognized leader in online payments, partly due to social-payments app Venmo.""We see PayPal as the best positioned large-cap payments company for the current environment, with a strong hold on its core online market and options on tangential markets remittance, credit and in-store,"" Wedbush analyst Gil Luria said in a research note last month.Shares fell 2.2% for the week, testing support at their 50-day line.Image provided by Shutterstock.

If a deal were approved by regulators, it would follow further consolidation in the payment processing industry. The sector has grown on the strength of e-commerce, more secure credit cards and the advent of Apple (AAPL) Pay and other mobile payments.Global Payments is a middleman between merchants and card-issuing banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM). Global Payments works with, not against, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and other mobile payment options for customers.Global Payments also said its Q2 sales rose 5% to $518 million, below consensus for $526.78 million. EPS rose 15% during the quarter to 76 cents, topping by a penny.The company also kept its full-year 2016 sales guidance of $2.06 billion to $2.10 billion, below views. It expects full-year EPS guidance of $2.90-$3.00, just below the midpoint.Follow Bill Peters on Twitter @IBD_BPeters.

377,GPN,"Vantiv (VNTV) CEO Charles Drucker said the payments processing company is ""firing on all cylinders"" after Vantiv reported better than expected third-quarter earnings for the fourth quarter in a row.The report pushed its shares to a new all-time intraday high Wednesday and gave the finance group a lift.Vantiv's earnings came ahead of PayPal (PYPL) Q3 earnings, slated for late Wednesday, its first since it began trading in late July after being spun off by former parent eBay (EBAY). PayPal rose 1.6% at the close — but tumbled sharply after revenue fell short.In the related credit card industry, MasterCard (MA) is slated to report Thursday morning. Visa (V) will announce results on Monday.Vantiv offers traditional and innovative payment processing products, including products for Apple (AAPL) Pay and the fast-growing mobile device sector, to merchants, banks and other financial institutions.The company's Q3 earnings, minus one-time items, climbed 20% to 59 cents per share as revenue grew 13% to $430.45 million. Wall Street expected 56 cents EPS on $413.96 million revenue.Vantiv, the nation's largest acquirer of PIN debit accounts — based on number of transactions — projects Q4 EPS of 61 cents-63 cents and $429 million-$437 million revenue. Both are roughly in line with analyst estimates.Its business net revenue from merchants services grew 16% to $345 million, mainly on an 8% hike in the number of transactions and a 7% increase in net revenue per transaction. Net revenue from financial institution services rose 3% to $86 million.Vantiv shares settled to an 8.4% closing gain to 50.92 on the stock market today after setting a record 52.44 intraday. Its stock has a 96 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed 96% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth.Shares of peer Global Payments (GPN) climbed nearly 5% to a fresh high after Vantiv's report. MasterCard was up 1.7%. IBD Leaderboard list stock Visa was up 1.7%.Late last year Vantiv launched Vantiv Mobile Accept, a card reader that attaches to mobile devices to let retailers take payments anytime, anywhere.

456,GPN,"If IBD 50 stocks are advancing, it's no thanks to sales growth. In their latest quarter, about 70% of the companies in the list reported revenue gains under 25% — the minimum gain that historically has characterized successful stocks.The average sales growth rate was less than 23%. It was skewed by two companies that more than doubled sales: Allergan (AGN) and Heritage Insurance (HRTG).Allergan, which has made big acquisitions, says that its revenue on a pro forma basis rose 12% in Q2.About a dozen IBD 50 companies had single-digit sales growth. (This breakdown was done based on last Monday's list.)Poor sales have hit consumer, medical, technology, transportation and other sectors in the IBD 50. In fact, sales weakness is pretty much endemic.In the second quarter, S&P 500 revenue fell 3.8% to $296.11 a share on a year-over-year basis, according to S&P Capital IQ. A slumping oil sector had much to do with the drop, but it wasn't the only reason.""Yes, energy has been a key reason for sales (and earnings) weakness,"" Lindsey Bell, senior analyst at S&P Capital IQ, told IBD. Excluding the energy sector, sales growth would have been 1.8% for Q2.""That said,"" Bell noted, ""growth ex-energy is still below the 10-year average of 6.5% as the strength in the U.S. dollar is weighing heavily on top-line growth. You can see that in the 3.6% decline the consumer staples sector posted during the quarter.""Indeed, some companies with currency exposure, such as Hawaiian Holdings (HA) (Q2 revenue down 1%), Cambrex (CBM) (up 9%) and Global Payments (GPN) (up 5%, but 15% excluding foreign exchange), cited currency factors in their earnings filings.The revenue slump is expected to continue. FactSet estimates that sales will decline in the third quarter by 2.9%. ""The Energy sector is expected to report the largest year-over-year decrease in sales of all 10 sectors, while the Telecom Services and Health Care sectors are expected to report the largest growth in sales of all 10 sectors for the quarter,"" a Sept. 18 report from Senior Earnings Analyst John Butters noted.Earnings for the S&P 500 companies are expected to drop 4.4%, FactSet says.Single-digit sales don't necessarily limit stock performance. Nike (NKE) roared out of a base Friday after it beat expectations with a quarter that saw sales rise only 5%.

Dow futures dived 172.8 points below fair market value and had held steady over the prior hour. Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 36.5 points, slightly off their hour-earlier lows. S&P 500 futures were steady, down 18 points. Small caps were taking their share of the heat, with Russell 2000 futures down 14.1 points.The stock market today took its early licks from oil prices, which backed down nearly 2% after the International Energy Agency confirmed prior forecasts that 2016 average demand growth for oil will slow to 1.2 million barrels a day from the estimated average of 1.8 million bpd this year.West Texas Intermediate held just above $36 a barrel and Brent crude traded a tad above $39; both were down more than 9% for the week.The news release and oil price drop hit after markets closed in Asia, but Europe's stocks pulled back sharply. The DAX in Frankfurt was down 1.9%, and the CAC-40 and FTSE 100 in London were down more than 1% each near midday. All are tracking toward losses of more than 3% this week. China's markets closed with moderate losses. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 in Japan gained 1%.In U.S. economic news, producer prices rose 0.3% in November, the Labor Department reported. That was up from a 0.4% slip in October and well above expectations for no change. Core prices, minus food and energy, also rose 0.3%, above views for a 0.1% uptick.November retail stopped just short of expectations, rising 0.2% — better than October's 0.1% gain but below views for 0.3%. Autos and gas were a negative for the month. Stripping out those categories, sales rose 0.5%, topping forecasts for a 0.3% gain.At 10 a.m. ET, October business inventories numbers from the Commerce Department are due out, and the University of Michigan releases its December Consumer Sentiment Index. Oil prices might get a stir after 1 p.m., when Baker Hughes (BHI) is scheduled to report its weekly rig count.Stocks listed on the Dow Jones industrial average were nearly unanimously negative before the open. DuPont (DD) again sank to the bottom, with a 4% decline, after announcing it formally agreed to merge with Dow Chemical (DOW), creating DowDuPont — a $130 billion chemical juggernaut. The companies expect the deal to close late next year.A large share of downward pressure on the S&P 500 were energy-related stocks. But the contest for the index's worst premarket decline was among DuPont, Staples (SPLS) and Red Hat (RHT), all down in the 4% to 5% range.At the top of the list, glass maker Corning (GLW) surged 8% on news of the Dow/DuPont deal, under which Dow Chemical will assume 100% ownership of Dow Corning, a 50/50 joint venture between Dow Chemical and Corning.Adobe Systems (ADBE) popped 5% after delivering a solid fiscal fourth-quarter report late Thursday. Earnings were above expectations, revenue in line and Q1 guidance below consensus forecasts. But strong growth in the company's cloud-based business and a rise in recurring revenue, to 74% of Adobe's total take, pleased investors.The stock ended Thursday in a test of support at its 10-week moving average, its first test since clearing a cup-with-handle base in October.Fiber optic networking gear maker Finisar (FNSR) spiked 13% after a healthy fiscal Q2 report. The stock ended Thursday deep in a six-month consolidation.Follow Alan Elliott on Twitter @IBD_AELliott and on Facebook.

547,GPN,"It's an interesting sign of the times: After 20 years of losing market share to debit cards, credit cards are making a comeback. According to the payment-industry newsletter the Nilson Report published Tuesday, credit cards accounted for 52.82% of U.S. card-based spending in 2012, up about 0.2% from the previous year. Debit-card share declined by a similar amount, to 47.18%.…

549,GPN,"Organized crime is snaring data from a lot of fledgling companies through automated attacks, Verizon Communications (VZ) found in its 2012 Data Breach Investigations Report released March 22. Two-thirds of the 855 incidents studied occurred at companies with 11 to 100 employees. The accommodation and food-services industries were hit worst, accounting for more than half of all breaches, while one in five was a retailer.
"
550,GPN,"Report co-author Chris Porter says poor passwords are one reason small companies are hit so much. Also, they usually lack any IT staff.
"
551,GPN,"""Small businesses easily fall prey to this type of attack because of the way they're set up essentially,"" said Porter, principal of the risk team at Verizon. ""They're really focused on their bottom line and want their point-of-sale systems to be available. They're not as worried about the confidentiality of the credit card data, for instance.""
"
552,GPN,"Sharing the same password across franchise locations doesn't help either, he says.
"
553,GPN,"""Basically, organized crime groups will scan the Internet looking for specific remote-access services and they'll try a couple guessable passwords,"" Porter said.
"
554,GPN,"Two events last week highlighted security issues. In one, Shawn Henry, outgoing executive assistant director of the FBI, said the U.S. is losing to hackers and will continue to do so unless it starts taking more action. Then on Friday, Global Payments (GPN), a large processor of MasterCard (MC) and Visa (V)credit cards, announced a security breach that it now says has impacted up to 1.5 million customers.
"
555,GPN,"At small businesses, Verizon's Porter says, when automated scans find someone using an easy or default password, hackers can automatically install malware. A keystroke logger can be ""preconfigured to collect data and automatically send it outbound by email, by uploading it to a website or to an FTP server,"" he said. ""This is automated end-to-end.""
"
556,GPN,"Porter calls such attacks ""low cost"" and ""easy.""
"
557,GPN,"Verizon conducted its study using data from breaches its own investigators probed in 2011 and also case data provided by five law enforcement partners: the Secret Service, the Dutch National High Tech Crime Unit, the Australian Federal Police, the Irish Reporting & Information Security Service and London's Metropolitan Police.
"
558,GPN,"In one example that culminated in a federal grand jury indictment of four Eastern Europeans last year, more than 112,000 credit and other payment cards were compromised from 163 restaurant franchise locations. Related losses, the report says, have topped $20 million. The ring was tied to at least 800 other compromised retail computer systems at hotels, movie theaters, medical facilities, restaurants and other businesses.
"
559,GPN,"""Preliminary investigations revealed that the point of sale (POS) server was connected to the Internet without a firewall in place or an antivirus program installed,"" Verizon's report said. ""Additionally, employees were allowed to use the system to access the Internet to check personal Web-based email. Analysis of the POS server identified a keylogging program, which had been used to capture payment card data.""
"
560,GPN,"Verizon's report recommended that small companies:
"
561,GPN," Use a firewall or access controls on remote-access services.
"
562,GPN," Change default credentials for POS systems and other devices that use the Internet.
"
563,GPN," Check a vendor's follow-through, if responsible for the above items.

564,GPN,"Porter, who's now collecting data for the 2013 report, says small-business breaches from automated attacks appear to be intensifying. So do breaches tied to intellectual-property theft.
"
565,GPN,"""Customer accounts — there's certainly a market for that — but also intellectual property: company product strategy, architectural renderings, even source code,"" said Larry Ponemon, whose Ponemon Institute last month issued its latest ""Cost of a Data Breach"" study with security firm Symantec (SYMC). ""Attackers are positioning themselves to get small amounts of data with high value.""
"
566,GPN,"That study pegged the average organizational cost for breach remediation in 2011 at $5.5 million, down 24%. It found the cost per compromised record — such as a person's credit card data — was down $20, to $194.
"
567,GPN,"""Most organizations still don't have a handle on where their confidential data is stored,"" said Symantec's Robert Hamilton, senior manager of product marketing for data loss prevention. ""Key among our recommendations is: Know where your confidential data is, then make sure your employees are properly educated on how to handle (it).""
"
568,GPN,"Hacktivist groups such as Anonymous and LulzSec made headlines last year with several high-profile attacks on companies. But Verizon's Porter says activist groups accounted for a relatively low number of breaches out of the 855 studied — though it's the first time they showed up at all.
"
569,GPN,"""When you dig further, you see activists accounted for 58% of total data loss,"" he said. In the past, activist attacks had more to do with defacing websites, ""not typically where they'd break into an organization, steal information and post it for the public to see so they can embarrass them.""
"
570,GPN,"In these not-for-profit breaches, the attackers typically got in and out quickly. Porter says in for-profit organized crime breaches there's more tendency for the attackers to try to get in and stay hidden, to collect as much data as they can.

580,GPN,"Payment processor Vantiv (VNTV) spun off from Midwestern regional bank Fifth Third Bank (FITB) in 2009 and has been shedding its provincial roots ever since.
"
581,GPN,"Vantiv went public in March, then completed a secondary offering in August.
"
582,GPN,"Cincinnati-based Vantiv handles payment processing for more than 400,000 merchant locations and 1,300 financial institutions in the U.S.
"
583,GPN,"Formerly known as Fifth Third Processing, Vantiv has been stepping up sales efforts to reel in customers beyond the Midwest.
"
584,GPN,"Its expansion focuses on small and midsize merchants and bank customers, where margins are typically higher for card processing service than large-scale clients.
"
585,GPN,"Vantiv still has plenty of national merchant customers, many from referrals from Fifth Third, including such Midwest-based chains as Kroger (KR) and Walgreen (WAG).
"
586,GPN,"Customer referrals from Fifth Bank account for more than 7% of Vantiv's revenue, analysts say.
"
587,GPN,"Though having a strong base of national merchants gives it scale, Vantiv's focus on smaller customers is paying off.
"
588,GPN,"Earnings Growth
"
589,GPN,"""Smaller merchants are typically more profitable,"" said JPMorgan analyst Tien-tsin Huang. ""That has helped them grow at above-average rates. It's pretty clear they are taking share.""
"
590,GPN,"In Q2, its first full quarter as a public company, Vantiv earned an adjusted 32 cents a share, with net income jumping to $23 million from $5.4 million a year earlier. Analysts estimate full-year profit will rise 16% to $1.37 a share.
"
591,GPN,"Net revenue, excluding network fees and other costs, rose 20% to $260.4 million. Management expects net revenue of $1 billion to $1.02 billion for the full year, for a 16% to 18% gain over last year.
"
592,GPN,"Vantiv works on behalf of merchants in two ways. First, it signs on merchants to help them accept credit and debit payments from card networks, such as Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA). Then it makes sure transactions using those cards are valid.
"
593,GPN,"Vantiv says it's the third-largest merchant acquirer in the U.S. and the biggest in PIN-debit volume.
"
594,GPN,"The company helps accept about 10% of all card payments in the U.S., says David Koning, an analyst with Robert W. Baird & Co.
"
595,GPN,"Koning says clients skew to selling everyday kinds of items, such as groceries and drugstore products.
"
596,GPN,"""It's spending people do on an ongoing basis in good and bad times,"" he said.
"
597,GPN,"In 2011, Vantiv handled $426 billion in bank card purchase volume at more than 400,000 merchant locations.
"
598,GPN,"Vantiv's average merchant customer takes in $2 million to $2.5 million in annual card volume, says analyst Andrew Jeffrey of Suntrust Robinson Humphrey.
"
599,GPN,"""That's the sweet spot of the market,"" he said.
"
600,GPN,"Vantiv boosted the number of small to midsize merchant customers with its acquisition of National Processing Co. in 2010.
"
601,GPN,"It's also been stepping up sales using direct reps as well as third-party agents and resellers.
"
602,GPN,"Two-thirds of Vantiv's revenue comes from merchants for processing their card transactions. The rest comes from financial institutions for providing them with debit, credit and ATM card transaction processing and other service, such as fraud protection.
"
603,GPN,"The firm's single, proprietary technology platform ""gives it economies of scale"" that most competitors don't have, said Jeffrey.
"
604,GPN,"Rivals include Heartland Payment (HPY), Global Payments (GPN) and privately held First Data, the largest independent domestic merchant acquirer.
"
605,GPN,"JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) Chase Paymentech is another large player.
"
606,GPN,"Vantiv's bank customers include regional banks, community banks and credit unions. Regional PIN-debit networks also use Vantiv.
"
607,GPN,"Vantiv is following the same approach as in its merchant business by going after small to midsize clients. Unlike large banks, smaller financial concerns aren't as apt to bring processing in-house.
"
608,GPN,"And they don't have the scale to negotiate prices down.
"
609,GPN,"""By having more small and midsize banks in their customer base, Vantiv has less risk from in-sourcing and it has higher margins,"" Jeffrey said.
"
610,GPN,"Vantiv's new customer, Discover Financial Services (DFS), caused net revenue per transaction in the merchant segment to edge down in the second quarter.
"
611,GPN,"The reason: Its large scale gives it pricing advantages.
"
612,GPN,"But the added revenue from Discover ""more than offset"" last year's loss of another relatively large account, Sovereign Bank, Koning says.
"
613,GPN,"""Discover is a pretty big win this year,"" he said.
"
614,GPN,"While the year-old Durbin Amendment cut bank interchange fees on debit transactions by 50%, payment processors aren't necessarily passing on all the savings to their merchant customers, who pay the fees, analysts say.
"
615,GPN,"""The industry is selectively trying to keep some of those Durbin savings to themselves,"" Huang said.
"
616,GPN,"Bundled Packages
"
617,GPN,"Vantiv is one of several that keep at least some of the savings to themselves as part of their bundled packages, analysts say.
"
618,GPN,"Heartland, however, passes along 100% of Durbin savings to merchants, Huang says.
"
619,GPN,"""That is their guiding strategy on pricing,"" he said. ""It's a marketing message: We're the good guys, the merchant advocates.""
"
620,GPN,"Still, Heartland has a smaller share of the merchant market — 4% to Vantiv's 14% share, he says.
"
621,GPN,"Vantiv hasn't expanded to faster-growing payment markets overseas like some rivals. But management has indicated it plans to expand outside the U.S. one day. No timetable has been set.

Square accepts Visa, MasterCard (MA), American Express (AXP), and Discover cards.""Based on the company's flat 2.75% transaction fee, we estimate Square's gross revenue at $170 million, and our understanding is that the company is not yet EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization)-positive,"" said Jefferies analyst Jason Kupferberg in a recent report.San Francisco-based Square competes with traditional point-of-sale payment processors such as VeriFone Systems (PAY) and Global Payments (GPN).The emerging mobile payments market is getting crowded, as eBay's (EBAY) PayPal unit and others rush in.Wal-mart, Target (TGT) and other retailers also are developing a mobile payments system. ISIS, a joint venture formed by phone companies AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) and T-Mobile U.S.A. also aims to be a player. Sprint Nextel (S), though, has partnered with Google (GOOG) for a payment system.In April, Apple purchased mobile security and software company AuthenTec for $365 million. Its new iPhone 5 doesn't include a mobile payment technology called NFC, or near-field communications. NFC is a short-range wireless communications technology that connects smart phones with payment readers. Smart phones require NFC electronic chips, creating a new potential market for semiconductor firms, analysts say.""Pay with Square shows that NFC may not be needed in a connected world,"" said Macquarie analyst David Gibson in a Sept. 6 report. The latest funding round will enable Square to expand outside the U.S.

Asia Pacific business should show strong revenues from Philippians, Singapore, Taiwan, and China led by Ezidebit and eWAY, payment solutions platform.We expect revenue accretion from the company’s acquisition of the communities and sports divisions of ACTIVE Network, in third quarter of 2017.

1094,GPN,"Verifone Systems, Inc. (PAY  -  Free Report) announced on Apr 9, 2018 that it has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by an investor group led by San Francisco-based Francisco Partners and Canada-based British Columbia Investment Management Corporation.Deal DetailsThe investor group will buy Verifone for $23.04 per share in cash. The value represents a total consideration of approximately $3.4 billion, inclusive of Verifone’s net debt.Verifone’s shareholders will receive $23.04 per share in cash, which is about 54% higher than the stock’s closing price of $15.00 on Apr 9, 2018.The deal also includes a ‘go shop’ period till May 24, 2018. In the interim, VeriFone’s board of directors and advisers can seek bids from other companies for alternative buyout proposals.Subject to customary regulatory and shareholder approvals, the deal is expected to close in third-quarter 2018. Post completion of the deal, Verifone will become a privately-held company.Share Price SkyrocketsFollowing the announcement of the deal, shares of Verifone gained 51.9% to close the trading session on Apr 10 at $22.78.Moreover, the stock has performed pretty well in the past six months. Shares have returned 11.8%, outperforming the S&P 500 Index’s and industry’s rise of 4.3% and 10.9%, respectively. Verifone Fails to Withstand Mounting CompetitionRapid adoption of new payment methods like contactless, NFC as well as mobile cloud-based payments, robust product portfolio, optimistic acquisitions and growth opportunities in under-penetrated countries are some of the strategic business initiatives undertaken by Verifone to strengthen foothold in the industry.Despite such strategies,mounting competition from lower-cost, mobile alternatives likes Square (SQ  -  Free Report), entry of new market entrants and latest technologies, declining revenues, divestures as well as buyout-related woes continued to bother VeriFone. A leveraged balance sheet is another headwind.Notably, for the past two fiscal years, the company reported declining revenues. Net revenues decreased 0.4% year over year in 2016 and 6.1% in 2017. We believe that the divestment decision was triggered by this continuous decline.

1095,GPN,"Shares of ABM Industries Incorporated (ABM  -  Free Report) have lost 11.2% against the industry’s gain of 3% on a year-to-date basis. Reasons Behind the Price PlungeThe company’s significant presence in the United Kingdom seems to be a major headwind for its operations. Post the Brexit referendum, the European economy has become highly unpredictable with disruptions and restrictions in acquisitions and trade with other European Union members. Such activities affect the company’s revenues and margins.Moreover, ABM Industries' dependence on inorganic growth is a concern. It appears that the company’s failure to make new acquisitions on a regular basis is hampering its growth rate with reduced revenues and margins. Strong competitive pressure also limits its success rate in bidding for profitable businesses and its ability to increase prices in accordance with rising costs.The company is also engaged in several energy efficiency projects. However, such projects remain exposed to federal and state legislature policies and natural disasters.Notably, the company's earnings missed estimates in first-quarter fiscal 2018. Adjusted earnings (from continuing operations) of 26 cents per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents and declined 31.6% from the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year decrease was largely due to interest expenses, amortization and higher share count. The company’s operating profit of $19.5 million was down 18.2% year over year.Downward Estimate Revisions & Zacks RankThe direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock. Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter earnings decreased 13.5% to 45 cents per share. Estimates for 2018 decreased 8.1% to $1.93 per share in the same time frame.The downward estimate revisions along with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) reflect pessimism over prospects of ABM Industries.Negative Earnings Surprise HistoryABM Industries has a disappointing earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters, delivering an average negative earnings surprise of 4.1%.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Fiserv (FISV  -  Free Report), Global Payments (GPN  -  Free Report) and Fidelity National Information Services (FIS  -  Free Report).

1097,GPN,"The players in the Financial Transaction Services industry have performed decently so far this year driven by improvement in U.S. economy, low unemployment, reduced inflation, and healthy consumer confidence that resulted in increased business volumes.The industry is also witnessing a shift from cash payments to online transactions, thanks to increased proliferation of information technology. Other forms of payments via plastic cards — credit, debit, charge and other cards — have also rapidly overtaken cash payments. Ease of carrying, safety against theft, payment flexibility, attractive rewards and a number of other features of plastic cards continue to boost transaction volume growth.Changing Industry TrendsThe economic growth in the United States has resulted in higher disposable income, eventually leading to greater customer spending. Plastic is now preferred over paper and borrowings are chosen over savings.  This has significantly propelled the companies’ transaction sales volume. Continuing the trend, the last reported quarter also saw solid revenue growth.Alternative payment modes such as e-wallets, mobile and digital currencies are gaining fast acceptance among customers. Cutting-edge technology that provides greater transaction security, flexibility, accessibility, touch-points and speed, all at a lower cost, has made digital transactions more attractive. Inspired by this, players in this space are making huge investments to support the development of new and emerging technologies in order to drive consumer spending.Inorganic growth has been a major attribute of the industry. The players have been consolidating through mergers and acquisitions, and indulging in strategic alliances and partnerships in order to expand their operations. Recent acquisitions of NuData Security by Mastercard Inc (MA  -  Free Report) and Heartland Payments by Global Payments, Inc. (GPN  -  Free Report), investment by Visa Inc (V  -  Free Report) in Swedish company Klarna and many more such deals indicate rise in consolidation activity in the space, which is expected to aid top-line growth. However, inorganic expansion has resulted in vast international operations for the Financial Transaction Services players, exposing them to foreign exchange volatility.One major threat faced by the industry is growing incidents of cyber-attacks and data leakage. Organizations are regularly updating their software and fraud detection systems in order to address this issue. They are also educating their consumers on basic security features.Moreover, the companies have been suffering from a persistent rise in operating costs led by higher marketing expenses by players in order to attract more customers amid stiff rivalry. Another major expense is massive investments in digitization that would hurt margins before reaping benefits in the long term.Industry Rank and Price PerformanceThe industry is thriving and its superior performance is evident from its rally of 32% in a year compared with 17.6% gain registered by the S&P 500. Therefore, investing in stocks in this industry is expected to generate decent returns over time.Stocks to ConsiderWe zeroed in on three stocks from the industry that carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and have also seen upward estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Moreover, these stocks have maintained their stellar performance in a year’s time.Green Dot Corporation (GDOT  -  Free Report) is an issuer of prepaid MasterCard and Visa cards in the United States.

1100,GPN,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Qiwi plc (QIWI  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in QIWI.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen one estimate moving down in the past 30 days, compared with just no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $1.20 a share a month ago to its current level of $1.08.Also, for the current quarter, Qiwi plc has seen one downward estimate revision versus no revision in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 25 cents a share from 26 cents over the past 30 days.  The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 10.3% in the past month.QIWI PLC Price and Consensus QIWI PLC Price and Consensus | QIWI PLC QuoteSo it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don’t have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Financial Transaction Services industry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock – Global Payments Inc.

1102,GPN,"Mastercard Incorported (MA  -  Free Report), essentially a technology company, is fast incorporating the blockchain technology into its operations. The company is going a step further by trying this novel technology after having made massive investments in its digital platform  over past many years. The need for the same is driven by changing trends in the digital economy, which calls for faster payments via electronic means.The company was the front runner in the adoption of this technology by announcing its blockchain API in 2016. Blockchain is the technology underlying the cryprocurrencies. As the name implies, it is a chain of blocks which gets built step by step. As each transaction takes place, it is put into a block, which is then connected to the previous block, the transactions are blocked together to form an irreversible chain.Though this technology is still in its nascent stage and its full potential remains yet to be harnessed, it is widely believed to be a game changer. The benefits of blockchain cannot be undermined in the payments space given the speed, flexibility, security and cost effectiveness it provides to the transactions.Last year, Mastercard launched its own blockchain network to implement the technology in the business-to-business (B2B) space to address challenges of speed, transparency and costs in cross-border payments. Mastercard intends to take advantage of the blockchain technology and the Mastercard Settlement Network to transfer funds between bank accounts. The Mastercard Settlement Network reads the blockchain and will transfer the funds between two banks. It then writes a confirmation of transfer to the Mastercard blockchain.The Mastercard blockchain technology will complement the company’s existing capabilities including virtual cards, Mastercard Send and Vocalink to support all types of cross-border, B2B payment flows — account-based, blockchain-based and card-based. The company is, however, not using the digital currency but keeping its transaction base in fiat currency.The company recently joined Enterprise Etherum Alliance, an open source block-chain consortium, to explore the potential of the etherum technology across a gamut of uses among which some are outside the scope of Mastercard’s traditional payments environment.  Year to date, Mastercard’s stock has gained 65% significantly, outperforming the industry’s growth of 38%.Another company in the same space, Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report), is working on the blockchain technology. American Express Co. (AXP  -  Free Report) last November, joined blockchain network RippleNet to explore the use of this technology for faster, more efficient B2B payments. Recently, The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office released the patent application filed by American Express Travel Related Services Company, the payment technology firm’s travel unit, which outlines the use of blockchain technology to accelerate payments between two parties. Its application emphasizes the potential for blockchain to enhance existing card networks.Mastercard carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Another player worth considering from in the same space is Global Payments Inc. (GPN  -  Free Report), which carries the same Zacks Rank as Mastercard and surpassed earnings expectation in each of the past four quarters, with an average beat of 4%.

1104,GPN,"Global Payments Inc. (GPN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 8.Riding on an increase in revenues, the company had surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.3% in the second quarter.Results reflected synergies from the Heartland acquisition (completed last year) and strong organic growth in its direct distribution businesses in the U.S.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Global Payments Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Global Payments Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Global Payments Inc. QuoteFactors to Consider     Increase in Revenues: Global Payments has sustained revenue growth for long, a trend that continued in the first half of 2017 (up 28%), driven by the accretion from the merger with Heartland Payments. The company’s consistent acquisitions, alliances and joint ventures fuel business growth and add to its top line. Moreover, there is ever-increasing demand for electronic payment transactions, which provide the company with abundant scope for growth. We thus expect to see increased revenues in the third quarter.Acquisition of ACTIVE Network: In September, the company completed the acquisition of the communities and sports divisions of ACTIVE Network, which provides cloud-based, mission-critical enterprise software solutions to event organizers. This acquisition will be highly complementary to Global Payments’ gaming business and expand its existing suite of innovative products and solutions. For the third quarter of 2017, the company expects ACTIVE Network to contribute revenues in the range of nearly $13 million to $14 million but have no impact on earnings.Strong Gaming Business: The company’s gaming business has been performing strongly for the past many quarters. It recently renewed and expanded its relationship with Caesars Entertainment. This renewal reflects the strength of its gaming services and we expect the business to continue its strong performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Superior Performing International Business: The company’s international business led by Europe and Asia-Pacific remains strong. Given its favorable performance in e-commerce and omni-channel solutions business in Europe, we expect the strength to continue.Increased Interest Cost and Foreign Exchange Volatility: Nevertheless, the bottom line may suffer from an increase in interest cost due to high debt incurred to fund its acquisitions. Also, its international operations will be exposed to foreign exchange volatility.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Global Payments is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Global Payments has an Earning ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Global Payments carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company's 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Green Dot Corp.

1105,GPN,"Payment processors have performed quite well so far this year, thanks to an improving U.S economy, low unemployment, a drop in inflation, and healthy consumer confidence that resulted in increased business volumes.The revolutionary shift from cash payments to online transactions continues to further propel transaction volume growth.Card Sales Aided by Economic GrowthThe economic growth in the United States has led to higher disposable income, resulting in greater customer spending. In the environment where plastic is preferred over paper and borrowings are chosen over savings, economic growth has resulted in a steep rise in the companies’ card sales volume. This is expected to drive the industry’s top line in third-quarter 2017.Mergers and Acquisitions to Aid Revenue GrowthThe players in the space are gearing up for growth through mergers and acquisitions, alliances, deals and pacts. Recent acquisition of NuData Security by Mastercard Inc (MA  -  Free Report), Heartland Payments by Global Payments, Inc.

This exposes them to foreign exchange volatility. Moreover, the dollar index fell 2.66% in the third quarter, which will weigh on the margins.   Increased ExpensesWe also expect to see an increase in operating expenses led by higher marketing spend by players in order to woo more customers in a competitive industry. Also increased investments in digitalization and geographic expansion will hurt the bottom line, before bringing results.Industry Rank and Price PerformanceThe industry’s superior performance is evident from its rally of 28.7% in the last year compared with 18.5% gain registered by the S&P 500.

1106,GPN,"Global Payments Inc. (GPN  -  Free Report) has completed the acquisition of the communities and sports divisions of ACTIVE Network, which provides cloud-based, mission-critical enterprise software solutions to event organizers.The deal was funded in cash-and-stock. The company used its revolving credit facility to fund the cash consideration of $600 million.This acquisition will be highly complementary to Global Payments’ gaming business and will expand its existing suite of innovative products and solutions. For the third quarter of 2017, the company expects ACTIVE Network to contribute revenues in the range of nearly $13 million to $14 million but have no impact on earnings.Global Payments is riding high on inorganic growth. The leading provider of merchant acquiring and payment technology services has successfully closed a number of acquisitions along with several alliances and joint ventures in the past. These led to a revenue CAGR of 12.5% between 2006 and 2016.   One of its major acquisitions was that of Heartland Payment Systems, valued at $3.9 billion (closed last year), in its North America segment. The deal accelerated growth by broadening Global Payments’ direct distribution channels in the United States and enhancing its vertical markets exposure.Its other recent successful acquisitions include the assets of FIS Gaming Business, Pay and Shop Limited, Ezidebit, PayPros and eWay.Year to date, the company’s shares have returned 36%, significantly outpacing the 24% gain by the industry it belongs to. The outperformance reflects the company’s strong growth, efforts to deleverage its balance sheet and value accretion.These buyouts have of course expedited growth for Global Payments. However, these have increased its debt burden, causing a spike in interest expenses that put pressure on margins.The payments industry continues to grow worldwide, presenting unique opportunities for the company to expand operations globally by pursuing acquisitions and creating alliances and joint ventures.

1108,GPN,"Optimism of U.S. consumers is at levels not seen in more than a decade and a half. Record low unemployment levels, better-than-expected job addition, strong wage growth and growing GDP have pumped up the spending power of consumers with increased disposable income for discretionary purchases.Moreover, the relaxation of tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act should increase consumers’ propensity to spend more.These trends bode well for the payment and network processors whose revenue growth is directly proportional to the level of consumer spending.Buoyant U.S. EconomyRecent strong developments on various fronts like a decline in jobless claims, growth in consumer spending low unemployment and GDP  growth show that the U.S economy is on a strong footing.Per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 200,000 in January, and the unemployment rate was at a very low level of 4.1%. Employment continued to trend up in construction, food services and drinking places, health care and manufacturing.The strength of the U.S. labor market is evident from the most-recent Labor Department figures which showed that U.S. filings for unemployment benefits decreased by 10,000 to 210,000, the lowest since December 1969 (better than the estimation of 225,000).Strong Consumer Confidence Index ReadingThese positives further buoyed up The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index, which measures consumers attitude toward current and short-term economic conditions (next six months). The index rose to 130.80 in February, from 124.30 in January. Incidentally, this was the index's highest level since November 2000, when confidence hit 132.60.What underlines the surge in the index is consumers’ belief that the cadence of growth will continue. This optimism has led consumers to use their savings to make purchases. This surely is a welcome sign for payment and network companies, which are the end-beneficiaries of rising consumer spending.It is to be noted that growth in consumer spending was  3.8% in the fourth quarter of 2017. This was the quickest pace since the fourth quarter of 2014 and followed a 2.2% rise in the third quarter of 2017. Market participants believe that this strength in consumer spending is sustainable going forward.Network and Payment Processors Set to GainThe thriving economy should thus benefit payment and network processors as the increase in consumers spending boosts retail sales as payments are increasingly being made by card, online and contactless methods. This marks a departure from the traditional cash and checks, thanks to the rapid percolation of technology in everyday lives.  Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report) one of the major payment processors and network providers,disclosed that in its fiscal first quarter (October-December 2017), the payments volume from United States grew 10% driven by increases in consumer credit and holiday spending. Growth was driven by better performance in retail and entertainment (sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels) which include movies, gaming, fitness, sporting goods and recreational activities. Both offline and online volume had higher growth rates than the prior year with online growing approximately four times faster than offline.On its most-recent conference call, Visa disclosed that the 2017 holiday season was stronger than the prior year as both consumer credit and debit grew at higher levels. Also, ecommerce continued to gain share, jumping to over 30% of consumer U.S. holiday volume. Ecommerce growth was strong across a number of categories but was more significantly strengthened by retail performance.Another major company in the same space Mastercard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) said that U.S. consumer confidence was healthy, unemployment low and holiday retail sales solid in the fourth quarter of 2017. Its U.S. Gross Dollar Volume (GDV), (which measures the aggregate amount of purchases made with Mastercard’s branded cards) grew 9%, up 3% from last quarter, and comprised Credit and Debit growth of 10% and 8%, respectively.Some Attractive Stocks in This SpaceGiven the strong macro backdrop, investing in this space should yield attractive returns for your investment portfolio.  Based on certain parameters, we have zeroed in on four stocks with a Zacks Rank#1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). These stocks have seen an upward revision in earnings estimates and have outperformed the industry’s growth of 35% in a year’s time.  Mastercard is perfectly poised to grow from higher switched transactions, increase in cross-border volume and gross dollar volume as well as gains from acquisitions. Following strong performance in 2017, the company upped its long-term EPS guidance. It now expects 2016-2018 earnings per share CAGR to be approximately mid-20% from 20% earlier.

It has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings and 2019 being revised 7% and 8.7%, respectively, upward over the last 60 days.Total System Services Inc. (TSS  -  Free Report), with a Zacks Rank of 2, has witnessed a revenue CAGR of 27% from 2014 to 2017. The top line should see a further upside from a strong market position and attractive core business that continues to be driven by new deals, renewed agreements, accretive acquisitions and expansion of service offerings. The company expects net revenues of 2018 in the band of $3.65-$3.75 billion, up 7-10% year over year and adjusted EPS of $4.10-$4.20, reflecting a rise of 22-25% year over year.The stock has risen 62% in a year’s time.

This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for GPN, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.62% heading into earnings season.Global Payments Inc.

1112,GPN,"Investor reaction to Equifax Inc.’s (EFX  -  Free Report) latest quarterly results were mixed as evident from yesterday’s late-hour trade. Following the company’s third-quarter 2017 results, the stock fell approximately 2.5%, then recovered and went up to nearly 1%. Finally, at the close of after-hour trading, it was down less than 1%.Analysts and investors were waiting for the credit information provider’s third-quarter results to have a better picture of the impact of the data breach incident on the company’s financial performance. Notably, this September, Equifax announced that very sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers has been stolen from its database.The company recorded $87.5 million of costs related to the data breach, which was the main reason behind the 27.5% decline in its third-quarter GAAP earnings. The company reported GAAP earnings of 79 cents, down from $1.09 posted in the year-ago quarter.Equifax stated that it is still not sure how much its bottom-line results have been impacted by the above-mentioned data breach. In its 10-Q filing with the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC), the company reported that over 240 class-action lawsuits have been filed against Equifax. It is currently facing probe from a number of investigating agencies and regulators.However, SEC’s rule of reporting financial results on a non-GAAP basis gave it a scope to overshadow the debacle. On non-GAAP basis (which excludes one-time items including the costs related to data breach), the company managed to report year-over-year earnings growth.Equifax’s non-GAAP earnings of $1.53 per share came in 6.3% higher than the year-ago quarter. Moreover, quarterly earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.49 and were toward the upper-end of management’s guidance rage of $1.50-$1.54 (midpoint: $1.52).It is quite possible that investors will have different opinions on the company’s bottom-line results, which may have resulted in such volatility during yesterday’s late-hour trade. Furthermore, it is possible that investors will be waiting for the third-quarter earnings conference call, which is scheduled to be held today before the market opens, for a better view on its growth prospects.Notably, the stock is on a downtrend since it reported the data-breach incident on Sep 8. It has lost 23.7% of its value since then, while the industry to which it belongs to has gained 6.4%.Let’s discuss quarterly results in detail.RevenuesEquifax’s top-line performance was also not impressive. Revenues of $834.8 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $847 million as well as management’s guided range of $853-$861 million. Although, the figure was up 3.8% on a year-over-year basis, it was the slowest growth rate in the last several quarters.Lackluster top-line performance was mainly due to the dismal performance at its U.S. Information Solutions (USIS) division which registered a year-over-year 3% decline in revenues to $307.7 million, reflecting a complete sign of impact from the data-breach scandal. The division witnessed revenue decline at all its sub-segments. Revenues from Online Information Solutions, Mortgage Solutions Services and Financial Marketing Services dropped 4%, 2% and 1%, respectively.However, the company’s other segments continue to perform well.Revenues from the International division (including Europe, the Asia Pacific, Canada and Latin America) advanced 12% year over year to $239.8 million. On a constant-currency basis, revenues increased 10%. Growth was mainly driven by the Veda Group acquisition, which increased the Asia-Pacific region’s contribution to revenues to $81.2 million, up 10% year over year. Moreover, revenues registered growth of 16%, 11% and 11% in Latin America, Canada and Europe, respectively.Revenues from the Workforce Solutions segment climbed 9% year over year to $186.4 million, primarily on the back of 13% revenue growth in Verification Services. Revenues from Employer Services remained flat year over year.Global Consumer Solutions contributed $100.9 million to total revenues. The figure was flat on a year-over-year basis.Operating ResultsEquifax’s adjusted EBITDA increased approximately 8.1% to $312.5 million. Adjusted operating EBITDA margin expanded 150 basis points (bps) to 37.4%. Adjusted net income came in at $185.9 million or $1.53 per share compared with $175.2 million or $1.44 per share reported a year ago.Equifax, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Equifax, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Equifax, Inc. QuoteBalance Sheet & Cash FlowEquifax exited the reported quarter with $315.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, down from the previous quarter’s balance of $403.9 million. Total long-term debt (excluding current portion) was $2.04 billion, flat quarter over quarter. During the nine-month period ended Sep 30, 2017, Equifax generated cash flow of $508.7 million from operational activities.In the first three quarters, the company paid dividend of $140.7 million. Also, Equifax’s board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of 39 cents to be payable on Dec 15 to shareholders of record date as of Nov 24. Notably, the company has a history of paying quarterly dividend for more than 100 years.Our TakeWe believe that due to ongoing uncertainty the company has not provided outlook for the forthcoming quarter. Therefore, we will have to wait for the company’s conference call today to have a clearer picture about its future prospects.Its escalating expenses related to the cyber attack will remain a drag on the company’s profitability. Also, per its 10-Q filing, the company expects to incur more expenses in the form of legal and professional services associated with the data-breach incident. Furthermore, it stated that its expenses might flare up due to increased investments in IT and security solutions as well as insurance services.The brand image and creditability of Equifax has been in question and is facing huge customer criticism, while cybersecurity companies are questioning its preparedness and response to the massive data breach. Moreover, with lawmakers and investigating agencies probing the mishap, its troubles are unlikely to end any time soon.We believe the entire issue may result in loss of customers and the company may also have to make huge compensation to its clients. This may have an adverse impact on the company’s financial performance in the near term.Currently, Equifax carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the same space include Envestnet, Inc. (ENV  -  Free Report), Global Payments Inc. (GPN  -  Free Report) and Total System Services Inc. (TSS  -  Free Report), all carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1117,GPN,"Shares of VeriFone Systems, Inc. (PAY  -  Free Report) tumbled to a 52-week low of $14.93 during the trading session on Apr 2. However, the figure recovered marginally to close at $15.14, down 1.5%.In fact, the stock has not performed well in the past three months. Shares of Verifone have lost 14.1% against the industry’s gain of 3.0% in the said timeframe. Reasons for the UnderperformanceMacro Headwinds and CompetitionVeriFone’s business continues to be affected by macroeconomic headwinds in emerging markets such as China and India. Further, VeriFone faces significant competition from a number of local providers in the domestic as well as international markets. Notably, non-GAAP revenues from North America and Asia Pacific declined drastically by 21.7% and 30.7%, respectively, in first-quarter fiscal 2018, on a year-over-year basis.Meanwhile, Verifone reported mixed financial results for first-quarter fiscal 2018. Earnings per share met the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved fr om the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP revenues, despite beating estimates, declined 4.3% year over year. The company’s System Solutions revenues declined 7% year over year to $243.1 million, owing to the headwinds arising from the U.S. petro business and Indian markets.Verifone Systems, Inc. Revenue (TTM)  Verifone Systems, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Verifone Systems, Inc. QuoteApart from this, the Electronic payment system and services market is highly competitive and fragmented. New market entrants such as non-card payment methods (using Internet and cloud instead of using physical cards) are expected to gain significant traction in the long run. Increased pricing pressure is another headwind. We believe the market is getting more competitive with the introduction of new market entrants and latest technologies.Divestures and Buyout-related WoesThe divestitures of China business, Petroleum Media business and Taxi Solutions business during 2017 are anticipated to hurt top-line growth in the near term. Multiple acquisitions, despite improving revenue opportunities, increase the company’s exposure to integration risks. Further, the company’s leveraged balance sheet may limit future expansion and worsen its risk profile. Higher interest rate on debt is expected to negatively impact profitability.Recent launches like Carbon Mobile 5 device and Verifone e280 mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) solutionwill take some time to contribute to growth.Downward Estimate RevisionsThe direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock. Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter earnings declined 12.1% to 29 cents per share. Full-year 2018 earnings estimates however remained unchanged at $1.48 per share in the last 60 days.Further, current quarter and full-year 2018 sales are estimated to decline 8.1% and 4.2%, respectively.The downward estimate revisions reflect pessimism over the prospects of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other Bearish ReadingsROC and ROEReturn on Capital (ROC) of Verifone is 7.1% compared with 19.9% for the industry. This implies that the company generates a lower return on investment than its industry.Return on Equity (ROE) is a measure of a company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds. Verifone’s trailing 12-month ROE undercuts its growth potential. The stock’s current ROE stands at 18.9% compared with the industry’s ROE of 37.2%.Debt-to-Equity RatioThe debt-to-equity ratio is a good indicator of the financial well-being of a company. To this end, Verifone seems to be a highly leveraged stock with a reading of 93.5% compared with 61.7% for the industry.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Fiserv (FISV  -  Free Report), Global Payments (GPN  -  Free Report) and Mastercard (MA  -  Free Report). All the stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #2.The projected earnings growth rate (3-5 years) for Fiserv, Global Payments and Mastercard is 11.5%, 15.8% and 18.3%, respectively.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1118,GPN,"The Financial Transaction Services industry is undergoing a dynamic change. Technology and innovations are leading to changing consumer habits and driving growth opportunities in ecommerce, mobile payments, block chain technology and digital currencies.As  payments style shifts from cash and checks to plastic and electronic mode, demand for debit and credit cards and online payments continues to rise. An improving economy has also set a positive trend in consumer spending by increasing the number or average purchase amount of transactions involving payment cards and devices.Moreover, the relaxation of tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is likely to increase consumers’ propensity to spend more.Strong Economy Bodes WellThe U.S economy recently witnessed strong developments like a decline in jobless claims, low unemployment, etc, which reflect that the economy holds immense growth potential. Solid growth in wage has boosted overall consumer spending resulting from increased disposable income.These favorable macroeconomic factors further boosted The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index, which measures consumers’ attitude toward current and short-term economic conditions. This optimism encourages consumers to use their savings to make purchases, which is a positive sign for payment and network companies, which are the end-beneficiaries of rising consumer spending.A Top-Ranked IndustryThe Financial Transaction Services industry looks attractive from an investment perspective.

1121,GPN,"Investors had mixed reactions on Equifax Inc.’s (EFX  -  Free Report) latest quarterly results as depicted from yesterday’s late-hour trade. Following the company’s fourth-quarter 2017 results, the stock rose approximately 2.2% but finally closed after hour trading at less than 0.5%. The share price movement apparently reflects uncertainty and cautiousness among investors pertaining to the last year’s data breach incident. However, the credit bureau company’s revenues and non-GAAP earnings per share came ahead of the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.In September 2017, Equifax announced that very sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers has been stolen from its database. Thus, analysts and investors waited with bated breath for the credit information provider’s fourth-quarter results, wherein updates on the data breach and its implication on the finances of the company were expected.During the quarter, the company recorded $26.5 million of costs related to the data breach. Notably, in the third quarter it had incurred $87.5 million owing to the same.Despite incurring this huge cybersecurity expense, the company managed to record a year-over-year increase of 40.6% in GAAP earnings per share, courtesy of the latest Tax Cuts and Jobs Act benefit which lowered the effective tax rate. The company recorded a one-time tax benefit of $48.3 million due to the recent tax enactment. On a GAAP basis, Equifax reported earnings of $1.42 per share, up from $1.01 posted in the year-ago quarter.However, on non-GAAP basis (which excludes one-time items including the costs related to data breach and benefit from lower effective tax rate) the company’s non-GAAP earnings came at $1.39 per share, 3 cents lower than the earnings of $1.42 reported in fourth-quarter 2016. Here, it should be noted that the fall would have been much more, but the Securities & Exchange Commission‘s (“SEC”) rule of reporting financial results on non-GAAP basis gave it a scope to somewhat mitigate the debacle. Equifax’s non-GAAP earnings came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.35.Diverse opinion among investors following the company’s fourth-quarter results might have led to the volatility in yesterday’s late-hour trade. Furthermore, investors focus will be on the company’s fourth-quarter earnings conference call, which is scheduled to be held today before the market opens, for a better understanding of its growth prospects.Notably, the stock is on a downtrend since it reported the data-breach incident on Sep 8. It has lost 13.1% of its value since then, while the industry to which it belongs to has gained 19.1%.  Let’s discuss quarterly results in detail.RevenuesEquifax’s revenues of $838.5 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $825 million marking a year-over-year improvement of 4.7%. However, it should be noted that this was the second slowest growth rate in the last several quarters after the 3.8% it registered in third-quarter 2017.Lackluster top-line performance was mainly due to the dismal performance at its U.S. Information Solutions (USIS) division which suffered a year-over-year 1% decline in revenues to $313 million, highlighting the impact of the data-breach scandal. The division suffered revenue decline of 9% at Mortgage Solutions Services sub-segment, while sales at Online Information Solutions remained flat year over year and at Financial Marketing Services witnessed 1% increase.Revenues declined at Global Consumer Solutions and in turn dented overall sales growth. Revenues at this division plunged 2% year over year to $97.3 million.However, the company’s other segments continue to perform well.Revenues from the International division (including Europe, the Asia Pacific, Canada and Latin America) advanced 15% year over year to $244.8 million. On a constant-currency basis, revenues increased 12%. The company registered growth at every international region with revenues increasing 10%, 16%, 18% and 17% in Asia-Pacific, Latin America, Canada and Europe, respectively.Revenues from the Workforce Solutions segment climbed 6% year over year to $183.4 million, primarily on the back of 11% sales growth in Verification Services, partially offset by a 5% decline at Employer Services.Operating ResultsEquifax’s adjusted EBITDA remained flat year over year at $292 million. However, adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 170 basis points (bps) to 34.8%. Adjusted net income came in at $168.6 million or $1.39 per share compared with $172.4 million or $1.42 per share reported a year ago.Equifax, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Equifax, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Equifax, Inc. Quote Balance Sheet & Cash FlowEquifax exited the reported quarter with $336.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, up from the previous quarter’s balance of $315.4 million. Total long-term debt (excluding current portion) was $1.74 billion, down from $2.04 billion at the end of previous quarter. During the year ended Dec 31, 2017, Equifax generated cash flow of $816 million from operational activities.In 2017, the company paid dividend of $187.4 million. Also, Equifax’s board of directors yesterday approved a quarterly cash dividend of 39 cents to be payable on Mar 30 to shareholders of record date as of Mar 12. Notably, the company has a history of paying quarterly dividend for more than 100 years.Our TakeWe believe that due to ongoing uncertainty the company has not provided outlook for the forthcoming quarter. Therefore, we will have to wait for the company’s today’s conference call to have a clearer picture about its future prospects.Escalating expenses related to the cyber attack will remain a drag on the company’s profitability. We expect the company to incur more expenses in the form of legal and professional services associated with the data-breach incident. Further, its expenses might flare up due to increased investments in IT and security solutions as well as insurance services.The brand image and creditability of Equifax has been in question and is facing huge customer criticism, while cybersecurity companies are questioning its preparedness and response to the massive data breach. Moreover, with lawmakers and investigating agencies probing the mishap, its troubles are unlikely to end any time soon.We believe the entire issue may result in loss of customers and the company may also have to make huge compensation to clients. This is feared to have an adverse impact on the company’s financial performance in the near term.Currently, Equifax carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the same space are Envestnet, Inc. (ENV  -  Free Report), Global Payments Inc. (GPN  -  Free Report) and Total System Services Inc. (TSS  -  Free Report), all carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Envestnet, Global Payments and Total System Services have long-term expected growth rates of 15%, 15.8% and 14.6%, respectively.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more.

(GPN  -  Free Report) came up with fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.07 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.01 and improving 23% year over year.Better-than-expected earnings were primarily due to higher revenues across its markets.Global Payments posted revenues of $939 million, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $942 million but grew 23% year over year.Total operating expense of $904.7 million increased 4% year over year due to an increase in cost of service.Adjusted operating margin improved 580 basis points to 14.2%.Growth Across SegmentsNorth America: Revenues of $687.7 million increased 14.4% year over year.

Also, GAAP revenues associated with the company’s gaming cash advance products will now be reported net of associated commissions paid to casinos. However, these changes will be not leave any impact on the bottom line.As a result of ASC 606, the netting of casino commissions reduced 2017 reported amounts by approximately $68 million and will likely impact 2018 by an estimated $73 million.Business UpdateGlobal Payments announced a joint venture with HSBC in Mexico.Our TakeThe company’s strong results reflect its effective business execution and growth from acquisitions.

1123,GPN,"Global Payments Inc. (GPN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 15. We expect the company to report higher revenues in the fourth quarter a trend seen in the first nine months of 2017 (up 21%), driven by the synergies from the merger with Heartland Payments.The company’s consistent acquisitions, alliances and joint ventures fuel business growth and add to its top line. Moreover, there is ever-increasing demand for electronic payment transactions, which provide it with abundant scope for growth. We thus expect to see increased revenues in the fourth quarter.Other Drivers of 4Q ResultsAccretion from ACTIVE Network Buyout: In the third quarter of 2017, the company completed the acquisition of the communities and sports divisions of ACTIVE Network, which provides cloud-based, mission-critical enterprise software solutions to event organizers. This acquisition will be highly complementary to Global Payments’ gaming business and expand its existing suite of innovative products and solutions.For the fourth quarter of 2017, the company expects ACTIVE Network to contribute revenues in the range of nearly $40 million to $45 million. However, due to the seasonality of the ACTIVE Network business, the company is forecasting this transaction to reduce margin expansion in the fourth quarter. The takeover will be immaterial to fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share.Superior Performing International Business: The company’s international business led by Europe and Asia-Pacific remains strong. Given its favorable performance in e-commerce and omni-channel solutions business in Europe, we expect the strength to continue.High Interest Expense: Nevertheless, the bottom line may suffer from an increase in interest cost due to high debt incurred to fund its acquisitions.GuidanceFollowed by strong earnings performance and closure of the ACTIVE Network acquisition, the company raised its 2017 adjusted earnings guidance to a range of $3.94 to $4.02 per share (from $3.85 to $4.00 guided previously), which reflects growth of 24% to 26% over 2016. Adjusted net revenues are expected between $3.505 billion and $3.53 billion (versus $3.40 billion and $3.48 billion), reflecting an increase of 23% to 24% from 2016.Earnings WhispersAs per our proven model, Global Payments is poised to beat estimates in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Global Payments has an Earning ESP of +0.62%.

1124,GPN,"Western Union Co. (WU  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter results on Feb 13, after market close.The company’s Consumer-to-Consumer segment is expected to witness an increase in transactions, which will be driven by strong growth in westernunion.com. We expect strong transaction growth from North America and Latin American countries, partly offset by declines from Europe, Middle East, Africa and South Asia regions.The company’s pricing actions should have also contributed to revenue growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from this unit is $1.1 billion, which translates into the year-over-year growth of 1%.Revenues from another segment, Business Solutions, should improve, led by a growth in business from Argentina, Pago Facil and the U.S. Speedpay bill payments businesses. The strengthening of key foreign exchange rates should also impact earnings in the segment.Additionally, the termination of a partner contract, effective during the fourth quarter of 2016, should impact the revenue negatively.Cost of services should have shown an increase due to higher bank fees, primarily in the company’s growing United States electronic bill payments services, and severance and related employee benefits and other expenses related to a business transformation initiative referred to as the WU Way. The company has committed to spending approximately $1 million on WU Way (its new business transformation program) in 2017 and these costs, related primarily to the implementation, consulting and severance, will be noted during each quarter. Part of this cost will, therefore, reflect in the quarter’s results.Also, the bottom line might suffer from elevated compliance spending.Share repurchases made by the company, from its strong cash flow generation, will aid bottom line earnings.Company’s Full Year 2017 GuidanceThe company expects a low single-digit GAAP revenue growth for the full year 2017, reflecting slight improvement from the previous outlook of flat-to-low single-digit increase and GAAP earnings per share, in a range of $1.50 to $1.60. Given the favorable profitability trends, the company also increased its adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $1.75 to $1.85, from $1.70 to $1.80 previously.Earnings Surprise HistoryWestern Union boasts an attractive earnings surprise history.

1126,GPN,"Global Payments Inc. (GPN  -  Free Report) is riding high on inorganic growth. The leading provider of merchant acquiring and payment technology services has successfully closed a number of acquisitions along with several alliances and joint ventures, in the past many years. These have led to a revenue CAGR of 12.5% between 2006 and 2016.   The company’s most-recently reported results also benefited from the accretion from its purchase of Heartland Payments completed last year. Moreover, there is ever-increasing demand for electronic payment transactions, which provide the company abundant scope for growth.Recently, the company upped its outlook for 2017 to account for the progress on the Heartland integration and strong first-half earnings. The company expects adjusted net revenues between $3.40 billion and $3.48 billion, reflecting an increase of 20% to 22% from 2016.Other acquisitions which include assets of FIS Gaming Business, Pay and Shop Limited, Ezidebit, PayPros and eWay have added to the company’s overall business. Recently, the company announced that it will acquire the communities and sports divisions of ACTIVE Network, providing cloud-based, mission-critical enterprise software solutions to event organizers. We believe the company’s active acquisition strategy will help it to achieve long-term growth.Year to date, the company’s shares have returned 38%, significantly outpacing the 25% gain by the industry it belongs to. The outperformance reflects the company’s strong growth, efforts to deleverage its balance sheet and value accretion from the acquisitions.Though these buyouts have expedited growth for Global Payments, the company shoulders significant debt to fund the Heartland acquisition. An increase in debt consequently led to a spike in interest expenses that put pressure on margins.Global Payments also remains exposed to currency volatility, since it derives nearly 30% of its revenues from international operations, which include Europe and the Asia Pacific. In the first half of 2017, currency exchange movements reduced revenues by 1.1%. The company’s earnings will continue to be affected by currency volatility, which is expected to prevail in the coming quarters.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderGlobal Payments carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked players in the same segment are Green Dot Corp. (GDOT  -  Free Report), Vantiv, Inc.  and Western Union Co. (WU  -  Free Report).
