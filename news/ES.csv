0,ES,"XWilliam Cline is going against the grain. Cline, a well-known economist, isn't convinced that the stock market is wildly overvalued. That's an increasingly lonely view.""Warning Signs Mount as Stocks Stumble,"" The Wall Street Journal headlined earlier this week. ""Investors are running out of reasons to keep buying U.S. stocks, exposing a growing number of warning signs,"" the Journal wrote. The most commonly cited are high P/E ratios, meaning the relationship between stocks' prices (the P) and their profits or earnings (the E). A June survey of investment managers by Bank of America Merrill Lynch found that 84% felt U.S. stocks are overvalued.Going back to 1936, the average P/E for the reported earnings of the Standard & Poor's 500 stocks has been about 17, notes Howard Silverblatt of S&P. Recently, the P/E has been about 24. Some tech companies have especially high P/Es.Not so fast, says Cline in a short paper for the Peterson Institute, the Washington think tank where he works. Statistical comparisons with the past, he argues, suggest the conventional wisdom is wrong. ""Low inflation, low unemployment and low interest rates (create) considerable justification for the relatively high price-earnings ratios,"" he writes.The stakes in this dispute are substantial. A weakening stock market could hurt the ""real economy"" of production and jobs, as consumers feel less confident and spend less. A falling market would also compound the woes of President Trump, who has viewed climbing stocks as evidence that support for his policies is greater than media coverage indicates.Even Cline says the market's advance has been ""robust."" From year-end 2011 to year-end 2016, the Standard & Poor's (S&P) index of 500 stocks rose an impressive 78%. Still, he notes, the gain is much less than the increase in a similar five-year period that led to the dot-com bubble. From year-end 1994 to year-end 1999, the S&P rose 220%.From 2002 to 2012, Cline says, stocks mostly followed profits upward. This is relatively uncontroversial. Fundamentally, stocks are supposed to reflect companies' present and expected future profits. But since 2012, stock prices have increased faster than profits, raising questions about whether the market is riding an unsustainable speculative wave.One explanation, according to Cline, is optimism about future profits. He cites forecasts by investment analysts that profits will grow rapidly in the next few years, up 37% in 2018 from 2016 levels. The more investors believe upbeat expectations, the more they can justify today's high stock prices.Cline relies heavily on a statistical model that attributes stocks' P/E ratios to three factors: the unemployment rate; the inflation rate; and interest rates as measured by the rate on 10-year Treasury notes. There's a logic behind each. Low unemployment signifies strong profitability — good for stocks — while higher jobless rate favors the opposite. Higher inflation fosters uncertainty and weaker profits. Higher interest rates draw money from stocks into bonds and certificates of deposit.Cline likes the results. ""During the past five years,"" he writes, ""the predicted P/E ratio has been relatively close to the actual level.""All in all, he reasons that stocks aren't trading far outside of what historical experience would suggest. The takeaway, if true, is that markets are acting mostly rationally and aren't driven by speculation. Stocks are simply more attractive than most alternatives today.But even Cline's calculus rests on optimistic assumptions — strong gains in profits, muted inflation, and low unemployment and interest rates. Any of these favorable conditions could reverse.Rising interest rates are the most obvious vulnerability. Indeed, the Federal Reserve is nudging rates higher to pre-empt worsening inflation and financial speculation. It's also possible that the turmoil of the Trump administration could spill into financial markets, as investors conclude that many of the president's proposals, including so-called tax reform, stand a scant chance of passage.So: The stock market may not be crazy, but it's certainly giddy.RELATED:Market TrendsHow To InvestMarketSmith

1,ES,"Stocks were mixed and mostly unchanged Friday in a back-and-forth session.XBuyers came in for a short spell on news that President Trump's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, is out at the White House, but the luster wore off quickly. After rising as much as 0.5%, the Nasdaq was up 0.2% with about one hour left to go in the session. The S&P 500 edged 0.1% higher, while the Dow Jones industrial average eased 0.1%.Options expired Friday, resulting in unusually heavy volume, particularly on the NYSE.The Nasdaq's advance/decline line has weakened considerably since the index's bearish ""outside day"" on July 27, which ended up being a distribution day. Nine distribution days in the Nasdaq since July 26 are a major source of consternation for the bulls. Signs of institutional selling like this has been seen at market tops in the past.The Dow's performance wasn't too bad considering that shares of Nike (NKE) were down close to 5%. It fell in sympathy with Foot Locker (FL), which plunged 25% on weak quarterly results.In the stock market today, gold topped the $1,300-a-troy-ounce level but pulled back. SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), the most liquid gold ETF, gave back early gains after trying to clear a 123.41 buy point. After rising nearly 0.9% early, shares were recently trading around 122.41, down 0.1%.Meanwhile, several names in IBD's Utility Leaders screen looked poised for upside breakouts. Eversource Energy (ES) added 1% to 63.06 as it works on a cup-shaped base with a 63.44 buy point. American Electric Power (AEP) picked up 0.5% to 72.33. It's also working on a cup-shaped base with a 73.07 entry.Growth stocks have been volatile lately, but IBD 50 and Leaderboard name Alibaba (BABA) added to recent gains, rising 2%, after jumping nearly 3% Thursday on another quarter of big earnings and sales growth. Friday's outperformance was fueled by several positive analyst comments.Meanwhile, strong earnings and a nice outlook from Applied Materials (AMAT) fueled a 3% gain. The chip-equipment bellwether is trading just above the 50-day moving average as it carves a cup-with-handle base with a 47.69 buy point.RELATED:6 High-Profile Names Setting Up Ahead Of EarningsFoot Locker, Hibbett Sports Crash On Earnings, Outlook; Nike Falls TooThis Company Wants To Secure Your Home With Phones And DronesThe Case For A New Secular Bull Run In Gold

2,ES,"Amid a slight cooling in U.S. interest rates lately (the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond's yield eased to 2.23% on Friday), utility stocks responded favorably. The Dow Jones utility average rebounded about 2.5% for the week, adding to a 0.8% rebound the prior week. Utilities are among many defensive stocks that are lagging the stock market today.

"
5,ES,"Amid a somewhat turbulent session for the major indexes Tuesday, many of the stocks making IBD's Utility Leaders screen showed stability.That's not all. At least four names have built sound-looking bases. Here is a brief review of their chart work.Utilities may continue to offer stable cash payouts and the prospects of capital gains so long as the Federal Reserve does not quickly raise interest rates and the prices of natural gas do not spike. The strong jobs market also benefits utilities in terms of attracting new customers and keeping current ones.Eversource Energy (ES), last covered in this column March 22, has arguably built a pair of handles on its nine-month saucer base. The first handle shows a 59.21 buy point, 10 cents above the Feb. 24 intraday high. The second handle shows an intraday peak of 60.36 and began with the reversal March 29. Add a dime to that price and you get an alternative buy point of 60.46.Notice how in both cases, Eversource did not rebound all the way back to the saucer's left-side high of 60.44.Handles that form within 5% to 15% below the left-side peak of a cup or double bottom tend to lead to successful breakouts. Remember, not all breakouts work. When the electric power utility, serving New England, cleared a 59.19 entry in an unusual-looking saucer base June 30, 2016, Eversource rallied for just two weeks, then dropped more than 16% over the next five months. Fortunately, shares did not venture far below the 10-week moving average, and a new saucer base was born.Eversource has a 3.2% annual dividend yield. It paid 47.5 cents a share March 31.Ameren (AEE) (3.2% yield) rallied past a 53.49 entry in a nearly eight month, cup-with-handle base on Feb. 21 this year. Now, shares are testing support at the rising 50-day moving average.Xcel Energy (XEL) (3.2% yield) has formed a nearly nine month, cup-with-handle base. The Minneapolis-based diversified utility has moved steadily after rising past a 44.19 entry on March 15. CMS Energy (CMS) (2.9%) has built a nine-month cup with handle, and a three-week handle offers a 45.65 entry. Again, like in Eversource and Xcel, one can see mildly lower handles within the base that are not too far off the left-side high in the cup itself.The S&P 500's annualized yield is around 1.93%.RELATED:The Income Investor: 4 Reasons Why This Dividend Play Might Soar In 2017The Income Investor: Should You Invest In These 3 Financial Plays?

6,ES,"Small-cap stock ETFs crushed their large-cap siblings in the postelection rally last year on hopes that President Trump would unleash the forces of growth pent-up in America. This year, they are crushing hopes.The small-cap iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) jumped 14% from Nov. 8 through December end, but has slipped 0.1% year to date. Its large-cap sibling, iShares Core S&P 500 (IVV), rose 5.5% over both periods.That sharp reversal of fortune for small caps was in the spotlight at the fourth annual FTSE Russell Small Cap Summit.""Our viewpoint is one of caution going forward,"" given small-cap valuations, earnings and the outlook for fiscal stimulus, said Steven DeSanctis, the SMID (Small And Midcap) strategist at Jefferies & Co.DeSanctis has been described by CBNC as ""one of the longest-running and most widely followed small-cap strategists on Wall Street."" He spoke to IBD on the heels of the summit.A comeback for small caps — companies with less than $2 billion in market capitalization, such as IBD 50 stock Nutrisystem (NTRI) — may depend on how these top trends play out, in his view and in the view of other investing experts at the FTSE Russell summit:Russell Rhoads, director of education at CBOE Options Institute, says that the index shows that investors perceive the risk for the U.S. small-cap market to be low and ""could indicate the beginning of a rotation back into small caps.""That raises concern for Rhoads given ""a market driven by sentiment and headlines."" An unanticipated event could shake the markets and smaller stocks tend to underperform when there is a pickup in risk, DeSanctis said.""I'm shocked we haven't seen a real elevation of volatility,"" he added.That is a level last seen around the time of the dot-com bubble in 2000, said Tom Goodwin, senior index research director at FTSE Russell.But he urges investors to keep P/Es in perspective, citing research that shows they explain about a third of the movement on share prices on a 10-year horizon and are even less predictive of future returns in the shorter term.""Valuations are elevated and a watch point,"" he said, ""but I wouldn't want to make too much of it.""The market's expectation of accelerating GDP growth was part of the reason why small caps ran way ahead of large caps late last year. But recently GDP estimates have moderated and the yield curve has flattened, which troubles small-cap experts.DeSanctis said: ""Smaller stocks offer the best returns over time. However in the near term, they should lag."" It may serve ETF investors well to temper expectations.But expectations for big defense spending, big infrastructure spending and big tax cuts are starting to slip. With the market pricing in reforms, the stock market rally could be in trouble if Trump fails to deliver, with small caps especially hard hit.DeSanctis is watching whether the promised economic stimulus will happen this year or become a 2018 issue.""This will really hurt those stocks that need to borrow and have debt on their balance sheets,"" DeSanctis said. ""Small-cap companies need to borrow to grow and, thus, this will hurt them specifically.""Monetary policy tightening will ring especially sweet in the ears of small-cap investors.According to FTSE Russell's Goodwin, U.S. small-cap stocks tend to perform positively over longer time frames during extended rate-tightening periods.RELATED:What Is Going On In The ETF Market?

7,ES,"To many investors, the price-earnings ratio is the single most indispensable indicator for any stock purchase. Sadly, they are putting their trust in a myth.Surely, the P-E ratio is the most common way to gauge a stock's valuation, i.e., how its share price compares with the company's earnings. Usually, the share price is divided by the trailing 12 months of earnings per share. The idea is that the lower the ratio, the more attractive the stock is.The ideal P-E ratio can vary, but many investors look for stocks with P-E ratios equal or lower than the S&P 500's, which is now about 25 on a trailing 12-month basis. This and other valuation methods are required reading for equity analysts and are treated in finance courses as accepted doctrine.But here's the rub: Decades of market research finds that winning stocks tend to have P-E ratios that value investors consider too expensive — even at the start of their giant price runs.As long as a stock has superior fundamentals, institutional support and other traits of market winners, the valuation doesn't really matter. Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL) famously reached a P-E ratio in the 50s and 60s while its share price went from 115 in September 2004 to 475 in January 2006.The folly of P-E ratios was discovered when IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil conducted research on what exactly caused stocks to explode in price. Strong earnings growth, especially in the two most recent quarters, was a key factor shared by these winners. But the P-E was usually well beyond acceptable levels when stocks began their big price advances. In fact, P-Es get even higher as the advance gains strength.High P-E ratios, O'Neil explained in ""How to Make Money in Stocks,"" are a result of accelerating earnings growth, which itself is what attracts institutional investors to stocks and causes share prices to soar.Today's market includes new examples of how successful stocks have defied the norms of price-earnings expectations. Veeva Systems (VEEV) topped a 28.05 buy point last May. The cloud-based software maker for the life sciences at that time had a lofty P-E ratio of 51. Veeva continued to climb, thanks largely to a strong earnings report in late May that pushed the stock to 52-week highs.In November, when Veeva broke out past a 42.68 buy point in an 11-week flat base, the P-E ratio was 63. Today, shares are trading above 50.New issue Planet Fitness (PLNT) broke out of a large cup with handle last July. At the time, the price-earnings ratio was 58. It didn't matter. The chain of gyms rose nearly 19% from the 17.35 buy point until it started a new base.RELATED:How To Invest: How Correct Buy Points Mark A Time Of Great OpportunityWhen To Buy A Stock: Some Big Winners Produce A Cup-Without-A-Handle BaseWhen To Sell A Stock: Maintain Good Defense By Quickly Cutting Your Losers Quickly

8,ES,"Oil fell as a Libyan port is set to resume shipments and the U.S. drilling revival undermines the potential for OPEC output curbs to rebalance the market.Futures dropped 1.2% in New York. Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said on March 16 that the kingdom may extend its cuts if supplies stay above the five-year average. A day later, though, data showed the U.S. rig count growing for a ninth week, and a Libya official said Sunday that the Es Sider and Ras Lanuf ports are preparing to restart oil exports.U.S. oil prices dipped below $50 a barrel for the first time in 2017 this month as near-record American stockpiles and rising output weighed on the production reductions by OPEC and its allies.While the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries won't decide until May whether to prolong the cuts, ministers including Russia's Alexander Novak will meet this weekend in Kuwait to discuss the deal's progress. Money managers cut net-long positions on oil by a record.""The reopening of the Libyan ports is the reason for today's drop, and the U.S. rig count doesn't help,"" Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York, said by phone. ""The drop in net-length is a signal from speculators that the market is vulnerable.""West Texas intermediate crude for April delivery, which expires Tuesday, fell 56 cents to settle at $48.22 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The more actively traded May contract dropped 40 cents to $48.91. Total volume traded was about 4% below the 100-day average.Brent for May settlement slipped 14 cents to $51.62 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude closed at a $2.71 premium to May WTI, the widest since January.Futures briefly pared losses after Reuters reported that OPEC producers increasingly favor extending production cuts into the second half of the year.""This is probably a short blip,"" Michael Cohen, head of energy commodities research at Barclays in New York, said by phone. ""This spread isn't sustainable. Our forecast is that WTI will go from a $2 discount early this year to a discount of 50 cents in the second and third quarters.""U.S. oil drillers boosted the rig count by 14 to 631 last week, data from Baker Hughes showed. They have added 106 machines to fields this year. The nation's crude output has climbed to 9.1 million barrels a day, the most since February last year, according to the Energy Information Administration. The agency is projected to report that crude stockpiles rose 3 million barrels last week, according to the median response in a Bloomberg survey.""We're in a very precarious position ahead of what should be an important report this Wednesday,"" Yawger said. ""We finally got an inventory drop in last week's report, but that came with a big drop in imports that may have been temporary. The market can't take another 2-, 3- or 4-million-barrel build without breaking its back.""Libya's Es Sider and Ras Lanuf ports will restart shipping oil in one week to 10 days, Jadalla Alaokali, a board member at National Oil Corp., said by phone. The country's oil output has increased to 646,000 barrels a day from 621,000 on Sunday due to more production from Waha Oil Co., he said.

9,ES,"Oil extended its longest winning streak in more than four months as the market anticipates that output cuts from OPEC and non-OPEC producers will help speed the elimination of a supply glut.Futures advanced 1.7% in New York, climbing for a seventh session amid gains in equity markets.Prices are set to recover next year as production cuts help to rebalance an oversupplied market, Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said last week. OPEC and 11 nations from outside of the group, including Russia, have agreed to trim about 1.8 million barrels a day next year.Oil has traded near or above $50 a barrel since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed last month to curb production for the first time in eight years. Iraq, the second-biggest OPEC producer, is fully committed to the accord, Oil Minister Jabbar Al-Luaibi said Thursday in Cairo at a meeting of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries. OPEC and its partners have established a committee to monitor the cuts and ensure producers abide by their pledges, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said.""OPEC is saying the right thing,"" and production cuts won't be assessed until later in January, Kyle Cooper, director of research with IAF Advisors in Houston, said by phone. It's bullish that the market has been able to ""hold above $50 a barrel. It's a big psychological level.""West Texas intermediate crude for February delivery rose 90 cents to $53.92 a barrel at 12:02 p.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange after earlier advancing to the highest intraday level in two weeks. There was no trading Monday because of the Christmas holiday. Total volume traded was about 64% below the 100-day average. Prices are up about 45% this year.Brent for February settlement climbed 85 cents, or 1.5%, to $56.01 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark was at a premium of $2.09 to WTI.""A lot of the strength in the market is mostly a result of the optimism that the production cuts will go through starting in the new year,"" Gene McGillian, manager of market research for Tradition Energy in Stamford, Conn., said by phone. Still, there is uncertainty about whether U.S. shale production will negate a large part of the cuts, he said.U.S. drillers added rigs for an eighth straight week, Baker Hughes Inc. reported on Friday. The U.S. oil rig count rose by 13 to 523 last week, the highest level since January.Gasoline futures for February delivery rose 2.1% to $1.6747 a gallon. The February gasoline crack spread, a rough measure of the profit from refining crude into gasoline, climbed by 70 cents to $16.56 a barrel.

10,ES,"The postelection stock market euphoria got a slight damper at the end of November as mutual fund investors realized global economies were still facing a lot of uncertainties, which could spur further volatility.The S&P 500 soared to its high of 2213.35 on Nov. 25. It then gave back a small portion of its gains to end the month up 3.4%. Friday's positive job-market report helped equities tick back up as unemployment came in at a surprise 4.6%, the lowest level in nine years. With that, a Fed rate hike in December is nearly a certainty.U.S. diversified equity mutual funds on average surged 5.19% in November, bringing their yearly return to 9.1%, according to Lipper Inc. By far, the winners were small-cap value funds, scoring an impressive 12.19% and boosting their 2016 gains to 22.47%. Their growth counterparts also did well, jumping 7.91% for a yearly gain of 9.18%.  Large-cap value funds rose 6.25%, while their growth counterparts only scored 0.72%.

Taxable fixed-income funds shed 1.68% on average, while municipal bond funds fell 3.37%.""Everything that we're analyzing — including taxes, trade, fiscal spending, deficits, interest rates, monetary policy, the dollar — all of these are very fluid situations,"" said Brian Flanagan, senior equity portfolio manager at Thrivent Asset Management and lead manager of the Thrivent Mid-Cap Stock Fund Class A (AASCX).Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category Performance On top of these, there were a number of conflicts present around the world before the election, he pointed out. Events such as Brexit, as well as the French and German elections, could rattle the markets even further. Just recently, European Central Bank's Mario Draghi warned of the risks to innovation, competition and productivity in the U.K. and to a lesser extend in Europe if the U.K. were to adopt a protectionist stance in the areas of trade, migration and foreign direct investment.That said, Bill Nygren — partner and portfolio manager at Harris Associates and manager of the Oakmark Select Fund (OAKLX), Oakmark Fund (OAKMX) and Oakmark Global Select Fund (OAKWX) — believes that equities represent the most attractive asset class: ""P/Es are very slightly higher than historical averages, but when you compare that to other choices like cash, that's yielding almost zero, or long-term bonds that are yielding only a couple percent, that small premium to historical averages seems like a good deal for equities relative to bonds or cash.""Nygren warns against loading up on high-dividend-paying names in the equity market that have been used as a substitute for low yields in fixed income. Those include the relatively stable businesses such as utilities, telecom and consumer packaged goods. He points out that these companies ""typically haven't traded at a premium to the market multiple and multiples on these stocks today are quite high. So . . . the business models that have a little more volatility, like the financial service companies, that have very low valuations relative to their historical valuations, are not only more attractive, but potentially safer investments than the overpriced low-risk businesses.""A name he likes in his $15 billion Oakmark Fund is Ally Financial (ALLY), one of the largest auto financing companies. He likes the fact that Ally is highly profitable, meets its capital requirements, and is expected to aggressively buy back shares. ""Like the other financials, one of the reasons Ally is priced cheaply is investors overweight the memory of the financial collapse in 2007-08.""Despite Oakmark Fund's value tilt, Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL) is its largest holding besides the financials. Not only does he expect Google to grow faster than an average company in the S&P 500, but Nygren believes you get YouTube, AI and autonomous driving businesses nearly for free.OAKMX is up 16.57% year to date through Dec. 1, comfortably outpacing the S&P 500 by over 7% and ranking first among 1,369 of its Morningstar peers.Thrivent's Flanagan finds that regional banks provide a lot of value. The $1.5 billion Thrivent Mid-Cap fund holds financial names such as Zions Bancorp (ZION), First Republic Bank (FRC), Raymond James Financial (RJF) and KeyCorp (KEY). Their stocks have all made strong runs higher this year.The fund's largest holding is NVIDIA (NVDA). ""Their core market was gaming, which continues to do incredibly well. And they've created a common platform across a number of industries where they can use their graphic-processing units to accelerate development,"" said Thrivent's Flanagan. Those markets include autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and data centers.The stock slipped from new highs in the past week amid a broad chip pullback.Thrivent Mid-Cap Stock Fund has surged 24.76% in 2016, impressively ahead of gains by its peers and the S&P 500 of 9.41 and 12.13%, respectively. The fund's average three- and five-year returns are also solid, at 13.09% and 16.25%.Jeremy Javidi, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments and co-manager of $612 million Columbia Small-Cap Value Fund I (CSMIX), has an overweight in financial services, accounting for more than 33% of the fund's assets.""We're very positively inclined to insurance stocks. They benefit as interest rates rise,"" said Javidi. He purchased American Equity Investment Life (AEL) in April. The stock had sold off in an overreaction to the unveiling of the Department of Labor fiduciary rule. ""Our longtime horizon has allowed us to pull the trigger fast when we saw the market misinterpret what the future outlook would be for a stock like AEL,"" he said.He also bought UMB Financial (UMBF) in December 2015 at $47. ""A little-known fact is they're actually the sixth-largest HSA depository in the country. Those HSA deposits have grown 40% each of the last three years,"" Javidi said.He believes utilities and REITs are no longer attractive. Instead, he looks at dividend growth rather than dividend yield. Other sectors he's constructive on are health care and energy. His microcap value fund is up 27.55% year to date.Craig Hodges, CEO and CIO at Hodges Capital and manager of $356 million Hodges Fund (HDPMX), picks industries and companies that have high barriers of entry, such as cement, steel, corrugated paper and even airlines. The midcap stock fund holds names such as United States Steel (X), U.S. Concrete (USCR), Matador Resources (MTDR), American Airlines (AAL), Adidas (ADDYY) and Duluth Holdings (DLTH).

11,ES,"Investors will find quite a few leading stocks in Fidelity Trend Fund (FTRNX), but it's taken more than just owning the likes of Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook for fund manager Dan Kelley to keep his fund apace or ahead of peers and the stock market.Much of the fund's success can be traced to what goes on behind closed doors: depth of research, fund manager experience, investment philosophy and the timing of buys and sells.And Kelley's views about several of his top holdings, appearing below, reveal a good deal about his plan of attack for beating the market.The $1.6 billion large-cap growth fund was up 3.43% year to date, through Wednesday, well ahead of its peers' 1.7%, and a bit behind the S&P 500's 6.52%. But its long-term track record is also looking good: Average returns over the past three, five and 10 years amount to 9.05%, 13.88% and 8.54%, respectively. The S&P 500 turned in 9.0%, 13.91% and 6.68% for those periods.IBD's TAKE: Stock holdings of top-performing mutual funds are a great place to look for investment ideas. But before buying any, you should thoroughly analyze them using such tools as IBD Stock Checkup.Fidelity Trend is also an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Award-winner, having beaten the S&P 500 in the past one, three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31.Kelley, the fund's manager since 2012 and with Fidelity since 2005, says Trend's main differentiating factor is it selects stocks with mispriced growth. ""I don't really care as much about how fast the growth is, I care about what I'm paying for the rate of growth.""As a result, he likes ""being paid twice, with both positive earnings revisions and a valuation re-rating if I'm right on those positive earnings revisions."" Estimated P-Es of stocks are adjusted lower when expected earnings are revised upward. This improves the attractiveness of such stocks.Kelley segments growth stocks into three buckets: quality, secular and opportunistic growers. Quality growth companies have proven management teams, stable earnings-growth profiles and strong balance sheets. Examples include Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL) and Visa (V).Secular growers ""are companies where I get a little discomfort in the valuation on near-term numbers, but they have the ability to grow at a very high organic growth rate for quite some time, and usually for longer than the market expects."" Salesforce.com (CRM) and Facebook (FB) fall in this category.Asked for his view on top holding Apple (AAPL), which just reported fiscal Q4 earnings and its first decline in annual profit in 15 years, Kelley said he could only comment on the situation as of the fund's last filing, Aug. 31.""In general, Apple needs to continue to innovate further on the smartphone for customer demand to remain high and earnings to grow,"" he said. ""The smartphone has become the most important device in most people's lives as the average person checks in 100 times a day. Hence, Apple needs to continue to provide customers with the best user experience, leading operating performance, and exciting new features to drive growth.""On Amazon (AMZN), he said the company, as of the fund's latest filing, still looked cheap vs. its long-term growth potential. ""What has changed from prior years, is the market has come to further appreciate the Amazon Web Services business and the long-term opportunity for that business, both from a revenue growth and earnings potential,"" he said. ""In addition, with respect to the core retail business, more retailers have embraced Amazon as a powerful distribution platform, which has allowed the company to operate more as a marketplace and enhanced the company's margin profile.""The third bucket includes opportunistic growth companies such as Williams Cos. (WMB). ""Those are companies that tend to trade at cheap valuations due to some concern — whether it be a cyclical company and the market gets worried about excess capacity, whether it be some sort of company-specific issue — and those names usually have the highest probability of being re-rated once we see some positive change,"" he explained.In the case of American natural-gas producer Williams, Kelley says that once they didn't get acquired, they started to make some corporate governance moves — changing the board and reducing their risk profile — which led to a re-rating of their stock.""Williams stock increased 28% in price from the end of July through Sept. 30,"" Kelley noted. ""It was the second-biggest contributor to fund performance during 3Q16. Before owning WMB, the fund had a preference to hold WPZ (Williams Partners (WPZ), a Williams affiliate), which also benefited from some of the same de-risking and commitment to balance-sheet improvement that Williams did.As a general rule, Kelley tries not to take huge sector bets. However, earlier in the year he did allocate about a 500 basis point overweight vs. the fund's Russell 1000 Growth index benchmark in the energy sector, which significantly contributed to the fund's performance.As to the three buckets, he usually lets the market dictate where the most compelling value is. That said, the quality bucket has probably been the largest one over time, comprising about 60% of the fund.Metal-packaging maker Ball (BLL) and water-pump and valve producer Xylem (XYL) both strongly contributed to last quarter's fund performance.Xylem has pulled back 9% from its early October peak and has fallen below its 50-day moving average.Kelley's take: ""While I can't comment on specific market moves that have happened since our latest public holdings disclosure, I think it's important to note that I take a long-term perspective when making investments on behalf of fund shareholders and look to take advantage of possible short-term market dislocations.""Global food-and-ketchup manufacturer Kraft Heinz (KHC) is a company that may have low organic growth and a high multiple, but it has a management team that are great capital allocators, points out Kelley. ""When they combined Kraft and Heinz, they took out a lot of cost. ... the management are really known to be really good operators of companies and they can go in and run them much leaner than they were run before. And so, what's happened historically, is that the synergies from these large-scale acquisitions had been much greater than initially expected.""RELATED:Amazon, Facebook, Alibaba Drive USAA Growth FundWhy A Top Columbia Fund Likes These Stock Leaders

15,ES,"Oil fell below $40 a barrel in New York for the first time since April, falling into a bear market on concern that the global supply glut will expand.Saudi Arabia cut prices to Asian customers as the country continues to fight for market share. Drillers in the U.S. boosted the number of rigs seeking oil for a fifth week, the longest run of gains since last August, according to data from Baker Hughes. U.S. crude and gasoline supplies are at the highest seasonal level in at least two decades. West Texas Intermediate settled 22% below its June peak Monday, meeting the common definition of a bear market.""We got here on the back of excessive storage in crude oil and gasoline,"" said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA in New York. ""The storage levels are so out of whack.""Oil has tumbled from its $51.23 June peak, ending a recovery that saw prices almost double from a 12-year low in February. The persistence of the supply overhang is upsetting industry expectations, with BP (BP), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSB) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) reporting second-quarter earnings last week that were worse than estimated.WTI for September delivery dropped 3.7% Monday to close at $40.06 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was also the first settlement below 200-day moving average since April, adding to the bearish pressure.Brent for October delivery fell 3.2% to $42.14 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, the lowest close since April 7. The global benchmark settled at a premium of $1.30 to WTI for October delivery.State-owned Saudi Arabian Oil Co. said Sunday it will sell cargoes of Arab Light in September at $1.10 a barrel below Asia's regional benchmark. That is a pricing cut of $1.30 from August, the biggest drop since November, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The U.S. oil drilling rig count climbed by 3 to 374, the highest level since March, Baker Hughes said Friday. The nation's crude inventories rose to 521.1 million barrels through July 22, keeping supplies more than 100 million barrels above the five-year average, Energy Information Administration data show.Demand for crude is set to decline in the next few months. U.S. refineries typically reduce operating rates to perform seasonal maintenance as the summer driving season comes to an end, after the Labor Day holiday in early September.""I think the market is going down in anticipation that summer is about to come to an end,"" said Bill O'Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis, which oversees $4.9 billion. ""There is a very strong historical trend for gasoline consumption to start to trail off once you get to Labor Day.""Gasoline for September delivery slipped 1.6% to $1.3036 a gallon, the lowest close since March 3. September diesel futures dropped 3.8% to $1.2579, the lowest settlement since April 18.Libya's state crude producer is working to resume oil shipments from three ports after a deal was struck to settle payments to local guards. The move may triple production but only after blockades on oil fields that supply the ports are lifted. National Oil Corp. ""will now start working"" with the unity government to restart exports from the ports of Ras Lanuf, Es Sider and Zueitina, according to an emailed NOC statement.""We have more than ample supply around the world,"" said Gene McGillian, a senior analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Conn.

The rally was in large part due to production disruptions and at least some are easing.""Oil has surged more than 85% since touching a 12-year low in February on signs that the global surplus is easing amid declining output. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is unlikely to reach an agreement this week in Vienna limiting production, as the group sticks with Saudi Arabia’s strategy of squeezing out rivals, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.West Texas Intermediate for July delivery fell 23 cents to close at $49.10 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract briefly topped $50 for the second time this year. Prices rose 6.9% in May for the longest run of monthly gains since April 2011. Total volume traded was 32% below the 100-day average at 2:53 p.m.There was no settlement on the Nymex on Monday because of the U.S. Memorial Day holiday. Trades were booked Tuesday for settlement purposes.In terms of technical analysis, the relative strength index for WTI started the session above the 70-point threshold that shows prices may have risen too quickly. It slipped below 70 as the market moved lower in late trading.""The relative strength index is chopping around 70 since May 24, which suggests that the rally is overdone,"" said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA in New York.Brent for July settlement, which expired Tuesday, slipped 7 cents to $49.69 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Prices capped a fourth monthly increase, also the longest streak since 2011. The global benchmark closed at a 59-cent premium to WTI. The more-active August contract declined 47 cents to $49.89.The Niger Delta Avengers claimed responsibility for attacks on facilities belonging to companies including Chevron (CVX), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Agip Oil, causing Nigerian output to tumble. A message on the Twitter handle @NDAvengers said the Nembe 1, 2 and 3 pipelines of the Brass-to-Bonny Truck Line were hit Saturday. Although the Twitter handle is linked to the group’s website, Bloomberg couldn’t immediately confirm the post’s authenticity.Libyan forces took control of the towns of Bin Jawad and Nofaliyeh after clashes with Islamic State militants, PFG spokesman Ali al-Hasy said by phone. The country is OPEC’s smallest producer, pumping about 310,000 barrels a day.

"
18,ES,"Underdog is a familiar role for Marco Rubio. It better be. He heads into Tuesday's Florida Republican primary reportedly trailing tall, rich guy Donald Trump perhaps by six, maybe eight points.That's the bad news. The good news is just a couple of weeks ago Rubio was behind by at least 20 points. Even then, he guaranteed a win.Politicians, especially those D.C. establishment ones, have under-estimated the son of Cuban immigrants before. Remember the 2010 election after incumbent GOP Sen. Mel Martinez suddenly retired? GOP Gov. Charlie Crist knew he should inherit the job. He appointed a pal as space-holder and announced his own candidacy.Like Chris Christie, Crist had notoriously hugged President Obama and even endorsed his stimulus spending. But crony blood runs deep; Washington's Republican establishment lined up behind Crist anyway, including 2008 GOP presidential loser John McCain and the National Republican Senatorial Committee putting up big bucks.Except this Rubio kid announced too. He was the Florida House Speaker, at 38 the youngest ever. With the enthusiastic support of Florida Tea Partiers, his optimistic messaging and an American-maid family success story, Rubio's conservative support grew. And grew.So much so that Crist was forced out of the Republican primary and became an independent enroute to becoming a Democrat.It didn't matter. Come November, Rubio racked up over a million more votes than Crist and 1.6 million more than the Democrat.You don't have to like Rubio to want him to win tomorrow. You just have to fear the unbelievable things faux conservative Trump would do to the Republican brand, not to mention the country if elected.If Trump captures Florida and perhaps snags Ohio too from Gov. John Kasich, he could become unstoppable to seize control of the party of Abraham Lincoln, who's turning over right now even beneath 15 feet of concrete in Springfield.Here's what Rubio has going for him: Donald Trump.The billionaire blowhard has managed to thoroughly alienate Hispanics, the fastest-growing voter cohort. ""I do great with Latino voters,"" Trump asserts absent proof. ""I employ so many Latinos. I have so many people working for me.""Working for The Man, however, is somewhat different than voting for The Man. Especially in a state like Florida where both Cuban and Puerto Rican voters play such an important role. Oh, did we mention Rubio is fluently bilingual?Just out is a new Gallup Poll. It shows Trump's favorable rating among Hispanics stands at 12%. 12%!! Gallup found Trump's unfavorable rating hovering at 77%, up from 66% last summer. Ted Cruz' ratings are also underwater, 26% favorable to 30% unfavorable. (Hillary Clinton's ratings, by the way, are 59% favorable, 26% negative.)Trump likes to claim Florida as a second or third home. But Rubio has the political and fundraising infrastructure of a sitting senator.Another Gallup survey finds the public images of Trump and Cruz sagging among Republicans, while Rubio's holds steady. The net positive ratings of Cruz (+14) and Trump (+15) are the lowest they've been this cycle.At +34, Rubio's net image is more than twice as positive.Rubio has done well almost everywhere he has focused in this campaign, especially among late-deciders. After being down 20+ points, he came close to upsetting Trump in Virginia.Another upset opening for Rubio is Florida's early voting, which locks in support, making it impervious to shifting daily news cycles.You may recall in 2012 Newt Gingrich was riding high, having vanquished vulture capitalist Mitt Romney in South Carolina. Only to run into and under Romney's early-voting steamroller in Florida. There, Newt's hopes were flattened.Just for fun, imagine Rubio thumping Trump in Florida. Half the real-estate guy's tirade would have to be bleeped. His supporters in their dandy red hats could make America great again by beating up all those dishonest reporters. And Trump's over-sized head would explode on national TV. In HD. Amazing. Just amazing.The ratings? They would be yuge. Yuge! Believe me.

23,ES,"Having just completed their first quarter since the Nov. 1 split of their former parent company, the stock of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, the Big Data and hybrid cloud operations of the old Hewlett-Packard Co., has outperformed its sibling HP Inc., which retained the legacy personal computer and printer business.The new Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) fell 2.5% in the stock market today, to 13.45. True, that's 15% off its all-time set Dec. 1 at 15.88, but HP Inc. (HPQ) is trading 33% below its post-Nov. 1 high of 14.82, touched Nov. 24. It fell 0.9% to 9.88 on Tuesday.""Upon the split we argued in favor of HPE over HPQ stock,"" wrote UBS analyst Steven Milunovich in a research note Tuesday. ""Hewlett Packard Enterprise has momentum with expected slight revenue growth in constant currency and an improving operating margin in fiscal 2016. This outlook was reinforced on the last earnings call (Nov. 25).""In contrast, HP Inc. told investors it would be investing for long-term gain. Our initial issue was the unsustainability of printer margins, but then unit demand fell apart last quarter. We remain concerned that HPQ estimates could be too high.""For the fiscal first quarter ended Jan . 31, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the Enterprise company to report earnings down 17% to 40 cents per share on revenue down 2.7% to $12.68 billion, vs. a pro forma 48 cents on $13.03 billion in the 2015 Q1.Analysts expect the performance of HP Inc., the PC/printer company, to slide further than Enterprise, with Q1 earnings down to 36 cents on falling sales to $12.23 billion.For fiscal 2016 ending Oct. 31, the Enterprise company expects earnings of $1.85-$1.95 per share minus items, vs. the $1.84 pro forma earned in 2015.  It guided revenue to $50.81 billion, down from the pro forma $52.12 billion of 2015.Analysts expect 2016 EPS of $1.87 minus items on revenue of $50.68 billion.Hewlett Packard Enterprise and analysts expect profitability and sales to improve in 2017 and beyond.Reiterating a buy rating and 18.50 price target on Enterprise, Milunovich said: ""HPQ is slightly less expensive than HPE on all measures, but we prefer HPE's better earnings momentum. Even discounting HPE's segment P/Es by 20%-30% relative to comps results in an overall multiple of almost 10x and a price target of $18.50. The stock looks more expensive on current but inexpensive on normalized free cash, which we expect to be achieved in fiscal 2018.""UBS rates HP Inc. as neutral with a 15 price target.Meg Whitman, who remains chair of both companies, took the CEO title of Hewlett Packard Enterprise as she had with the former company, but named Dion Weisler CEO of HP Inc.Both companies are expected to report fiscal Q1 earnings this month.

24,ES,"Iran: Ten U.S. sailors kneel at gunpoint before Iran's military, then actually apologize, and while held captive, merit no mention in the president's speech to Congress. It's American weakness illustrated.We don't yet have the full facts on how a U.S. naval vessel was allowed to be seized by the world's foremost terrorist state. But as Desert Storm infantry commander and Clinton drug czar Gen. Barry McCaffrey (ret.) warned in an NBC News interview, ""this is an affront to our military presence in the Gulf and will unsettle our allies in the region.""Sticks and stones may break our bones, but images can hurt a global power profoundly. Hubert Van Es' infamous photo of desperate evacuees scrambling toward an Air America Huey helicopter on the roof of a Saigon building, as North Vietnamese surrounded the city, symbolized American impotence in the 1970s.The Islamic State understands that a picture can be worth a thousand bullets, producing blood-curdling videos of its atrocities. For Iran, images of U.S. sailors kneeling in submission, and video of one apologizing on behalf of the rest — and, by extension, on behalf of the U.S. — are, as the MasterCard commercials put it, ""Priceless.""""It was our fault,"" the sailor said on camera. ""And we apologize for our mistake.""What a comparison with the tortured crew of the U.S.S. Pueblo, captured by North Korea in 1968, who during their captivity discreetly extended their middle fingers when posing for propaganda photos. Today, Secretary of State John Kerry says, ""I want to express my gratitude to Iranian authorities. ...""As Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said, ""Before we thank the Iranian naval forces and attempt to defend and normalize their behavior, as Vice President Biden and Secretaries Kerry and Carter appear inclined to do, we should demand answers"" to questions that include:""Where exactly were the sailors intercepted? Why were they detained instead of being merely escorted into international waters? What was the nature of the technical malfunctions on both vessels? ... Was sensitive equipment compromised? (and) Why were the sailors not permitted to contact U.S. higher headquarters in the region for the 16 hours they were detained?""Cotton also noted that the administration presumes that Iran conducted a rescue mission, ""when Iran has characterized the incident as U.S. ships trespassing into its waters and 'snooping.'""He added: ""Our sailors never should have been detained in the first place, and blithely accepting such action will only embolden the ayatollahs who wish to do harm to Americans and our allies in the Arabian Gulf.""This humiliation of the U.S. comes less than a week before we lift sanctions unfreezing $150 billion for new terrorist activities, as promised in Obama and Kerry's Iran nuclear deal — a pact that Tehran has not even been required to sign.Our sailors were held as Obama stood before Congress on Tuesday night, but they weren't deemed worthy of mention in the president's address. The nuclear deal he considers his big foreign policy achievement, moreover, got only 41 words in a speech that lasted just under an hour; he devoted four times as many words to the Iran nuclear talks in last year's State of the Union.Iran, obviously, isn't something President Obama wants Americans to think about anymore. Because it has become synonymous with American decline.

35,ES,"War On Terror: Bill Clinton apparently knew as president that Iran was behind the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing but suppressed the evidence. It's one of an array of failures arguing against another President Clinton.A half dozen Saudi Arabians involved in the terrorist attack targeting U.S. Air Force personnel housing 19 years ago, killing 19 of our servicemen and injuring hundreds, told the FBI they got their passports from Iran and reported to a high-ranking Iranian general, according to the Washington Times.Former FBI Director Louis Freeh confirmed to the paper that when he presented the evidence implicating Iran to the White House, they brushed it aside, calling it mere ""hearsay."" He was asked not to disseminate the information because the administration sought closer relations with the terrorist regime in Tehran.Like President Obama today, ""They were looking to change the relationships with the regime there,"" Freeh told the Times.The newspaper cited a now-declassified top-secret cable from 1999 in which Clinton told then-Iranian President Mohammad Khatami of ""credible evidence that members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps along with members of Lebanese and Saudi Hizballah were directly involved in the planning and execution of the terrorist bombing in Saudi Arabia of the Khobar Towers military resident complex.""President Clinton had altered U.S. policy toward Iran in the hope that the new president would change Tehran's terrorist ways, and his White House publicly suggested Iran's role in Khobar was uncertain.In 2006, there was enough evidence publicly available for families of Khobar victims to win a U.S. civil suit holding Iran liable for hundreds of millions of dollars.Wayne White, a State Department intelligence officer from 1979 to 2005 who was investigating Khobar, told a diplomatic oral history project that intelligence on the attack ""had been cut off by Sandy Berger,"" Clinton's national security adviser. Berger was later convicted in an attempt to smuggle classified documents regarding terrorism out of the National Archives.This tops off a long list of failures for Bill Clinton in combating terrorism. They include: The 1993 World Trade Center bombing, killing six and injuring about 1,000, which brought jihadists' attention to the twin towers as targets, prefiguring the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The 1995 Riyadh, Saudi Arabia bombing of a U.S. military training center, killing five Americans and two Indians. The 1998 al-Qaida bombings of the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killing 224 people and wounding about 5,000. The failed U.S. bombing of sites in Afghanistan in an effort to kill Osama bin Laden, which many at the time suspected was merely an attempt to distract from Clinton's Monica Lewinsky sex scandal. The 2000 USS Cole bombing in Yemen, killing 17 U.S. sailors and injuring 37 others. Richard Miniter, in his book ""Losing Bin Laden,"" documents how, during the Clinton administration, then-Rep. Bill McCollum, a Florida Republican, founded and chaired the House of Representatives' Taskforce on Terrorism. He eventually gathered evidence from the Mujahideen who fought the Soviets in Afghanistan, and who knew bin Laden when he fought with them.""They emphasized that he wanted to murder Americans,"" Miniter wrote, and that he was tied to assassinations and terror operations in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen.And, they said, the wealthy Saudi terror master was becoming more powerful and well-connected.""We knew that it was just a matter of time before we saw a major terrorist attack on America,"" McCollum said. But ""McCollum couldn't believe that the Clinton administration would ignore such serious intelligence that he had developed about a real and present threat.""It's fair to ask: How much different would a Hillary Clinton war on terror be?

39,ES,"Zebra products have a variety of uses, from printing bar-code labels, receipts and plastic ID cards to encoding passive RFID smart labels and cards. Its asset-tracking technologies incorporate bar codes and RFID as well as mobile computing, data capture, wireless local area networks, location systems and Zatar, the company's cloud-based Internet of Things (IoT) platform.

41,ES,"Zebra is part of IBD's Computer-Hardware/Peripherals group, which also includes tech heavyweights Apple (AAPL), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) and Canon (CAJ).
"
42,ES,"Calling On Motorola
"
43,ES,"After logging only single-digit EPS and revenue growth in 2012 and 2013, Zebra last year delivered a 61% revenue gain and a 27% earnings increase.
"
44,ES,"The company got a lift from rising demand for its core thermal bar-code and RFID printers as well as its October 2014 acquisition of Motorola Solutions' (MSI) Enterprise Solutions (ES) business.
"
45,ES,"That deal, valued at $3.45 billion and funded with about $200 million in cash and $3.25 billion in new debt, is forecast to boost growth even higher this year.
"
46,ES,"""The acquisition is really transforming the company to be a source of all equipment rather than their traditional, narrower niche. It's one-stop shopping for customers,"" said Elliott Schlang, managing director of Great Lakes Review, an institutional research boutique in Cleveland.
"
47,ES,"The Motorola business deepened Zebra's portfolio of bar-code scanning and RFID technologies, including those that let warehouse managers track inventory with handheld devices or help medical personnel store information on patients. In addition, the acquired unit brought aboard expertise in mobile platforms and other advanced technologies geared toward the Internet of Things.
"
48,ES,"The $3.45 billion price tag was pretty hefty for a company that logged under $1.7 billion in revenue last year, but so far the integration seems to be going well, analysts say.
"
49,ES,"""There's a risk whenever a company of this size makes a major acquisition and pays through the nose for it,"" Schlang told IBD. ""But thus far, the speedy integration and the very meaningful strategic acquisition they made gives us some comfort that (the deal) will continue to do well for them.""
"
50,ES,"Zebra has fully integrated the Motorola unit's sales staff, says Northcoast Research analyst Keith Housum, but the back office integration will take longer. ""All indications are that the integration is coming along well,"" he told IBD.
"
51,ES,"Synergies At Scale
"
52,ES,"The deal certainly made sense from a logistics standpoint, Housum says. Both Zebra and the Motorola ES unit did business through many of the same channels and with many of the same distributors. The combined company has been able to take advantage of more efficiencies and scale.
"
53,ES,"That scale is reflected in Zebra's recent financial performance. It has delivered two straight quarters of triple-digit revenue growth since the deal closed and is expected to do the same when it reports second-quarter earnings on Aug. 11.
"
54,ES,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Zebra to post Q2 revenue of $885.4 million, up from $288.4 million the prior year. EPS is seen rising 40% to $1.18.
"
55,ES,"The company reported Q1 earnings of $1.39 a share, well above consensus estimates of $1.12. Revenue more than tripled to $893.2 million, also above views.
"
56,ES,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year earnings to rise 52% this year and 24% in 2016.
"
57,ES,"""The enterprise side is going through a growth cycle that I expect will continue through the next two years, which will help drive results,"" Housum said.
"
58,ES,"Along with that growth should come an improvement in the acquired Motorola ES unit's performance, he says.
"
59,ES,"""The enterprise segment had issues with management as well as issues in Asia,"" Housum said, but changes in the unit's management late last year have helped resolve many of those issues.
"
60,ES,"In an email to IBD, Zebra spokeswoman Therese Van Ryne said that the integration of the Motorola Solutions Enterprise business into Zebra is ""going well.""
"
61,ES,"""We're focused on being flexible, making good decisions and hitting key target dates,"" she added. ""The continued hard work, collaboration and commitment of Zebra employees is driving our success. These efforts are making Zebra an even more innovative and customer-focused company.""
"
62,ES,"Meanwhile, Zebra's core printer and RFID businesses also continue to produce strong results, Schlang says.

66,ES,"Last week Professor Jeremy Siegel and I chatted with Mark Yusko, Chief Investment Officer of Morgan Creek Capital, about his thoughts concerning extended U.S. valuations and global markets that may offer abundant potential beyond that of the United States. Reactions to the April Jobs Report 
"
67,ES,"Professor Siegel was generally encouraged by the April jobs report. He especially liked that hourly earnings were up only one-tenth of 1%, as he believes it allows the U.S. Federal Reserve to be more patient about hiking interest rates. 
"
68,ES,"Yusko struck a more doubtful tone. He thinks that in order to get the 3% growth the Fed is looking for, job growth that should run in the range of 260,000 to 280,000 jobs per month. 
"
69,ES,"Professor Siegel retorted that poor economic growth recently has been a function of weak productivity—and that current job growth could be translating to 4% to 5% gross domestic product (GDP) growth if it weren't for such dismal productivity. For the first time in 22 years, we witnessed two consecutive quarters of negative productivity growth in the U.S. Why Is the Fed Saying the Market Is Expensive? 
"
70,ES,"Fed Chairman Janet Yellen recently commented that equity valuations are high on a historical basis, but she added the caveat that they are not that high when we consider the low-interest-rate environment that we are in today. 
"
71,ES,"Siegel believes that we could be in a long period of slow growth, with GDP averaging 2%. He thinks this will keep the 10-year TIPS at levels not more than 1.5% and the 10-year nominal Treasury rate at 2.5% to 3% when adding inflation on top of real interest rates. Siegel believes this could justify a 20 to 22 times price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) ratio, while the S&P 500 is currently trading at a P/E ratio of 18 times earnings and its average since 1954 is 16.5x. 
"
72,ES,"Yusko believes that equity valuations are near highs today. He cites the market cap-to-GDP ratio being second only to the period after the technology bubble in 2000—2001. He also places a high value on the price-to-sales metric and is concerned because margins are rolling over and profit growth is negative. Yusko points to GMO co-founder Jeremy Grantham, who sees returns over the next 10 years averaging -1.1%. Julian Robertson Now Bearish for Third Time in 15 Years 
"
73,ES,"Yusko pointed to his mentor, Julian Robertson, founder of the famous Tiger Management. Robertson has been bearish three times in the last 15 years. The first time was 1999—2000 when he shut down his hedge fund. The second was right before the subprime crisis in 2007. Robertson started getting more bearish last November and has reiterated those worries recently. Yusko is looking for a repeat of the 2000—2002 bear market scenario for U.S. equities. 
"
74,ES,"Professor Siegel cautioned that P/E ratios on the S&P 500 were closer to 30x earnings in 2000—2001 and 90x earnings in the Technology sector with real interest rates between 4% and 5%—much tougher competition for stocks. Siegel believes we are in a very different market environment today— interest rates near zero and more reasonable P/Es—and believes comparison to the 2000-2001 time frame is less relevant. Buying Japan Today Is Like Buying the U.S. in 1984 
"
75,ES,"While Yusko is worried about the opportunities in the U.S., he believes that Japan's future is bright. Yusko expects the U.S. market to lag Japan's significantly over the next eight years—by as much as two to three times the relative return potential. 
"
76,ES,"Yusko also believes the key to achieving this return is to hedge the yen. He thinks the yen-per-dollar currency pair could reach close to 130 by the end of 2015, rise closer to 140 to 150 in 2016 and reach 175 to 200 on the yen over the next four to five years. For perspective, Yusko recalls how the yen used to trade at levels closer to 350. 
"
77,ES,"Japan has excessive debt, and Yusko believes Japan has no other way out but to devalue its currency. He is further encouraged by GDP prints that look positive and inflation trending closer to 2%. Yusko believes buying Japan today is like buying the U.S. in 1984. Emerging Markets Quite Attractive 
"
78,ES,"Looking more globally, Yusko believes Japan beats Europe, Europe beats the U.S. and emerging markets (EM) beat them all in the coming years! 
"
79,ES,"In EM, he is optimistic on service economies such as South Korea, Taiwan, China and India that are beneficiaries of lower oil prices. Commodity countries such as Russia and Brazil, on the other hand, have a harder time and should struggle with lower oil prices. 
"
80,ES,"Yet, one of Yusko's top 10 surprises coming into the year was that Russia would be one of the best performing markets after very disappointing performance. He believes we are just getting started with Russia, and we may see up to triple-digit returns from the country.

90,ES,"President Obama will deliver yet another State of the Union Address with much the same message and policy prescription of his first six: Spread the wealth around. He wants $320 billion in new taxes on both the middle class and wealthy over the next decade to pay for income redistribution handout programs that are supposed to help the poor and middle class.
"
91,ES,"But Obama has been president now for six years. If his redistribution policies worked, why are the poor getting poorer and why has the middle class stalled out? Is this George Bush's fault?
"
92,ES,"The irony of the Obama presidency is that a White House obsessed with income inequality has managed to produce only more inequality. Arguably every policy that this administration has pursued — from the $830 billion stimulus bill, to giant welfare program expan sions, to massive infusions of cheap money into the economy via the Federal Reserve, to ObamaCare and then tax increases on those at the top of the income ladder — was designed as part of a great Robin Hood strategy to take from the rich and give to the poor. Instead, by the president's own admission, the bottom 90% have seen almost no progress.
"
93,ES,"Gini Out Of The Bottle
"
94,ES,"The Gini coefficient (as measured by the Census Bureau), the left's favorite measure of income inequality, rose in each of Obama's first four years in office, breaking all-time highs in both 2011 and 2012; it remains near those levels now. So Obama's infatuation with steal from the rich and give to the poor has backfired. Just listen to a speech by the darlings of the left these days, Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren, and all you will hear is how the middle class has gotten shafted while Obama has been president. News alert: That may be why Democrats got wiped out in the last election.
"
95,ES,"So why would anyone think that more of the same is going to lead to a different result?
"
96,ES,"Mr. Obama likes to say that the middle class has been in a rut for decades. Nonsense. In the 1980s and 1990s, the middle class made startling financial progress. From 1983 to 2005, upward income mobility allowed the middle class to see a rise in real incomes of near 30%. That was an era of relatively low tax rates, free trade, a responsible Fed, welfare reform, and pro-business regulatory policies that allowed American companies to compete in world markets. Many people at the top became very wealthy, but the rising tide of that era lifted almost all boats.
"
97,ES,"What does Mr. Obama propose to help the middle class? Start with a series of boneheaded new taxes on the rich that sound like they were designed by French economist Thomas Piketty, the new guru on economics in liberal America. They could very easily stall the economy yet again:
"
98,ES,"Capital gains taxes would be raised to 28% from 23.8%. But the history of this tax is that when you raise it, you get less revenue, and when you lower it, Uncle Sam gets more money. This is a direct tax on the startup capital that people invest in small and startup businesses. Raising the tax will mean less money flows to get new American companies running, at a time when studies are showing that entrepreneurial ventures are already getting started at a slower pace under Obama. Fewer new businesses means fewer jobs.
"
99,ES,"Raise the estate and inheritance tax to 60%. Two years ago, Congress and the president reached a rare bipartisan deal to cap the death tax at 40%. Now Obama wants to raise it even further. But when you tax lifetime savings, the rich — who already have paid taxes on their income when they earned it — simply invest less in family businesses and find tax shelters to avoid paying the tax. Family-owned businesses are the lifeblood of the American economy, and if we want more jobs we need more investment in them, not less.
"
100,ES,"A new tax on banks. This seems like a small tax of 0.07% on liabilities at about 100 large financial firms with more than $50 billion in assets. But the end result of this tax (estimated at $110 billion over the next decade) will be to harm America's status as the financial capital of the world. Kenneth E. Bentsen, CEO of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, warned last week the tax would penalize ""America's most productive financial institutions"" and would ""curtail economic growth."" How will making trades and deals that get made in firms based in Manhattan or Los Angeles or Chicago more expensive relative to those in Tokyo, Beijing, London, or Hong Kong help American workers?
"
101,ES,"What would this money be used for? Free stuff. Free community college. More dollars for student loans. Mandatory paid family leave. ""Gender equity"" in the workforce. Minimum-wage hikes. More infrastructure spending — just not for the Keystone XL pipeline. Tax credits for those at the bottom of the income scale, even though the vast majority of those in the bottom 40% already pay no income tax.
"
102,ES,"These tax-and-spend policies are hardly innovative or original. In fact, Europe has tested them for decades. In euroland, high investment and income taxes — along the lines of Obama and Piketty — pay for a vast social welfare state to help the poor. Nearly the entire continent is turning into an economic wasteland. Is the White House not paying attention?
"

"
106,ES," Moore is chief economist at the Heritage Foundation and a member of the IBD Brain Trust.President Obama will deliver yet another State of the Union Address with much the same message and policy prescription of his first six: Spread the wealth around. He wants $320 billion in new taxes on both the middle class and wealthy over the next decade to pay for income redistribution handout programs that are supposed to help the poor and middle class.But Obama has been president now for six years. If his redistribution policies worked, why are the poor getting poorer and why has the middle class stalled out? Is this George Bush's fault?The irony of the Obama presidency is that a White House obsessed with income inequality has managed to produce only more inequality. Arguably every policy that this administration has pursued — from the $830 billion stimulus bill, to giant welfare program expan sions, to massive infusions of cheap money into the economy via the Federal Reserve, to ObamaCare and then tax increases on those at the top of the income ladder — was designed as part of a great Robin Hood strategy to take from the rich and give to the poor. Instead, by the president's own admission, the bottom 90% have seen almost no progress.Gini Out Of The BottleThe Gini coefficient (as measured by the Census Bureau), the left's favorite measure of income inequality, rose in each of Obama's first four years in office, breaking all-time highs in both 2011 and 2012; it remains near those levels now. So Obama's infatuation with steal from the rich and give to the poor has backfired. Just listen to a speech by the darlings of the left these days, Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren, and all you will hear is how the middle class has gotten shafted while Obama has been president. News alert: That may be why Democrats got wiped out in the last election.So why would anyone think that more of the same is going to lead to a different result?Mr. Obama likes to say that the middle class has been in a rut for decades. Nonsense. In the 1980s and 1990s, the middle class made startling financial progress. From 1983 to 2005, upward income mobility allowed the middle class to see a rise in real incomes of near 30%. That was an era of relatively low tax rates, free trade, a responsible Fed, welfare reform, and pro-business regulatory policies that allowed American companies to compete in world markets. Many people at the top became very wealthy, but the rising tide of that era lifted almost all boats.What does Mr. Obama propose to help the middle class? Start with a series of boneheaded new taxes on the rich that sound like they were designed by French economist Thomas Piketty, the new guru on economics in liberal America. They could very easily stall the economy yet again:Capital gains taxes would be raised to 28% from 23.8%. But the history of this tax is that when you raise it, you get less revenue, and when you lower it, Uncle Sam gets more money. This is a direct tax on the startup capital that people invest in small and startup businesses. Raising the tax will mean less money flows to get new American companies running, at a time when studies are showing that entrepreneurial ventures are already getting started at a slower pace under Obama. Fewer new businesses means fewer jobs.Raise the estate and inheritance tax to 60%. Two years ago, Congress and the president reached a rare bipartisan deal to cap the death tax at 40%. Now Obama wants to raise it even further. But when you tax lifetime savings, the rich — who already have paid taxes on their income when they earned it — simply invest less in family businesses and find tax shelters to avoid paying the tax. Family-owned businesses are the lifeblood of the American economy, and if we want more jobs we need more investment in them, not less.A new tax on banks. This seems like a small tax of 0.07% on liabilities at about 100 large financial firms with more than $50 billion in assets. But the end result of this tax (estimated at $110 billion over the next decade) will be to harm America's status as the financial capital of the world. Kenneth E. Bentsen, CEO of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, warned last week the tax would penalize ""America's most productive financial institutions"" and would ""curtail economic growth."" How will making trades and deals that get made in firms based in Manhattan or Los Angeles or Chicago more expensive relative to those in Tokyo, Beijing, London, or Hong Kong help American workers?What would this money be used for? Free stuff. Free community college. More dollars for student loans. Mandatory paid family leave. ""Gender equity"" in the workforce. Minimum-wage hikes. More infrastructure spending — just not for the Keystone XL pipeline. Tax credits for those at the bottom of the income scale, even though the vast majority of those in the bottom 40% already pay no income tax.These tax-and-spend policies are hardly innovative or original. In fact, Europe has tested them for decades. In euroland, high investment and income taxes — along the lines of Obama and Piketty — pay for a vast social welfare state to help the poor. Nearly the entire continent is turning into an economic wasteland. Is the White House not paying attention?To get wages rising again and to create more jobs for the poor, it would be a very helpful first step simply to stop bashing and penalizing the employers who provide the wages in the first place. Stop treating businesses like they are enemies of the state. Fix the corporate tax system.

142,ES,"Among Carillon Scout Mid Cap Fund's (UMBMX) holdings, such stocks as Abiomed (ABMD), Arista Networks (ANET) and Comerica (CMA) are providing enough lift to keep the fund ahead of its midcap blend fund peers and within shouting distance of the S&P 500.X The fund is down 0.37% this year as of Feb. 28 vs. a 0.87% decline by its midcap blend peers tracked by Morningstar Direct and a 1.83% gain by the S&P 500.But it's the fund's longer-term performance that catches the eye. It's outperformed both its peers the S&P 500 in the past one, three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31. It rose 24.02%, and an average annual 14.17%, 16.35% and 11.13% in the past three, five and 10 years.Former Air Force B-52 bomber crew member Patrick Dunkerley and his co-managers oversee the top performing mutual fund. In an interview with IBD, Dunkerley credited the strong showing to his investment team, their disciplined investment process that combines fundamental, marco economic and technical analysis, as well as a flexible valuation approach.IBD: You not only beat peer midcap funds in the past 1, 3, 5 and 10 years, but you also beat the S&P 500 in that period, one of only 16 mid cap funds to do so. What's behind the strong performance in both short term and long term?Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersPatrick Dunkerley: We are fortunate to have performed well over many years and different time periods. We seek to generate good risk-adjusted returns as measured against our benchmark, the Russell Midcap Index.  I credit our team members, including our team chemistry plus our disciplined investment process for this sustained performance.Co-managers Derek Smashey and John Indellicate have been with us since inception in 2006, and co-manager Jason Votruba joined us in 2013, along with senior analysts Craig West following health care and Eric Chenoweth following energy and utilities, who joined us in 2016 and 2017 respectively.Our investment process is unique because we incorporate both top-down macroeconomic and company specific analysis, with an emphasis on quality stocks, and a flexible valuation approach, which changes depending if market conditions are bullish or bearish.IBD: The biggest exposure has been to tech, consumer cyclical, financial services and industrials. What do you see the source of performance in the balance of this year? What macro trends are affecting your decisions?Dunkerley: Healthy leading indicators, good credit availability, adequate money supply growth, and an upward slope to the U.S. Treasury yield curve all support our bullish equity view at the moment, but increased volatility seems likely given the market sentiment is adjusting to higher interest rates.  From a sector point of view, we are sticking with investments in cyclical companies for now, with an emphasis on technology, financials — including banks and insurance companies that benefit from higher interest rates, industrials, materials, and energy as strong U.S. and global growth is lifting earnings.The consumer discretionary sector is enjoying a new tailwind, with retail sales coming in stronger than expected, and more earnings performance likely as the U.S. tax cuts and wage increases stimulate growth.  We believe stock selection is important so we own deep discounters such as Ross Stores (ROST), or other retailers than can blunt the effect of online competition.  In addition, consumer companies offering unique experiences such as Live Nation Entertainment (LYV) benefit as millennial consumers seek entertainment, such as live concerts.We believe U.S. inflation will increase and the dollar should continue to be soft if risk-on investor sentiment prevails in 2018.Our position in gold miner Newmont Mining (NEM) helps to insulate the portfolio from a gradually declining U.S. dollar, and should capture benefits from an improving gold price due to curtailed capital spending in the gold mining industry. The company pays a 1.4% cash dividend yield, and has unhedged exposure to the gold price.Stronger defense spending funded by the recent federal budget should help companies like Harris (HRS), a leader in military radios. In addition, companies like Hexcel (HXL) and Xylem (XYL) are profiting from global growth in aircraft demand and the need for better water treatment, respectively.We expect equity markets to rise further, but, if credit conditions turn bearish due to an overly aggressive Federal Reserve, then we would become more defensively positioned.  This will eventually happen, but it's not happening at the moment and we believe bullish conditions for U.S. equities are intact, despite the recent volatility in the markets.IBD: Where are we in the small cap, mid cap and large cap cycle of outperformance/underperformance?Dunkerley: We think mid caps are set up for competitive performance with the other capitalization categories. For the trailing 10 years ended Dec. 31, 2017, U.S. midcaps and small caps have outperformed their large-cap cousins, as measured by the various Russell indexes, with midcaps generating the best returns over that time period.  This midcap outperformance is consistent with longer-term historical data dating back to 1979, although we would caution that mid caps do not outperform in every time period.For example, last year, the large caps outperformed.  But, given the long-term historical outperformance of U.S. midcaps, they deserve a premium valuation and currently they do trade at a slight premium to large caps, based on forward looking (estimated) price-to-earnings ratios.  We believe the recent outperformance of large caps was driven by a valuation discount that was too wide.  But that discount has narrowed.IBD: Do you buy only midcap companies or will you buy large caps and small caps as long as they don't lift or lower the average market cap above or below midcap?Dunkerley: We seek to buy stocks within the market capitalization range of our benchmark, the Russell Midcap Index, with particular emphasis on companies with greater than a $2 billion market capitalization as they are often more liquid.IBD: What's your process for buying stocks? Do you start with screening for fundamentals?Dunkerley: We believe an active approach can outperform the benchmark by choosing higher-quality stocks, and by employing both top-down and bottom-up portions of our research process.  We follow over 150 economic indicators on a weekly basis, and we employ a toolbox approach to valuation, utilizing different tools during a bull market cycle to measure upside potential of a stock, while paying more attention to downside valuation risk during bear markets.We believe a good understanding of the macroeconomic picture helps us to more effectively position the portfolio sector weights, which are important.In addition, our bottom up research checklist helps us to identify the fundamentally strong companies with favorable financial characteristics, undervaluation, good business models, effective management, and that are free from serious litigation risks.IBD: How big a role does technical analysis play in your selection process?Dunkerley:  We do look at charts, particularly as an aid for timing of trades, or to help better understand the fundamental picture at a company.  Some of the ""cheapest"" stocks in the long run, in other words the best long-term investments from my experience, are found making new highs.We don't have to be the first to buy or sell a stock in order to be successful, as significant moves up or down can often be long lasting.  So quite often, the market will ""discover"" a stock as evidenced by strong price action seen in the chart. We just have to do the fundamental work to make sure the investment is sustainable. We also buy stocks that are experiencing price corrections if we think they have the quality characteristics we seek, so we are not exclusively buying stocks near highs.IBD's TAKE: Many of the top performing stocks in the past were trading at new price highs and above-average P-Es before they made the biggest gains of their run-ups. IBD: What are your sell rules?Dunkerley: Our process is to sell a stock due to a negative change in the fundamentals, problematic valuation, if we find a better investment alternative, or to manage our portfolio characteristics. One advantage of active management is the ability to seek to sell stocks with weakening fundamentals before the bad news is fully reflected in the stock price, so we strive to act decisively when our thesis changes.IBD: Do you spend much time talking with company management or do balance sheet and earnings report tell you what you need to know?Dunkerley: We believe the numbers reported by companies are one of the most important clues in securities analysis, determining the quality of the business, spotting trends, and evaluating the effectiveness of management. Good investment practice involves a thorough understanding of the cash flow statement and balance sheet, in addition to the income statement. We believe too many investors ignore the former and emphasize the latter, and this causes problems particularly during bear markets.However, we also like to invest with good management teams, and our investment team meets with various company managements nearly every week, or sees them at conferences in order to better size up their strategies and abilities.We also read conference call transcripts to deepen our understanding of the businesses and better understand the strategy of management, in addition to face-to-face meetings.Finally, competitive dynamics are always important and we seek to own companies we perceive as having a sustainable advantage so they can better protect profits and grow, such as a unique products or strong industry position, new product cycle, or management skill.  But we don't exclude commodity businesses that we think are experiencing an upcycle in fundamentals.IBD: Do you have a standard size, steps or range for beginning positions?Dunkerley: We often ramp a new position to at least 50 basis points (half of 1%) of the portfolio fairly quickly.IBD: Your portfolio is quite diversified with 154 stocks and 18% in the top 10 and no stock account for more than a little above 3%. How do you manage your winners?Dunkerley: We let winners run when it seems prudent to do so, although we often trim the position if we think the upside move is overdone. Our forward-looking valuation tool, the discounted earnings model helps us to gauge upside potential in a stock, primarily during bull markets.We build these for each stock we invest in, it's part of our fundamental analysis. So if we notice a stock discounting too much of its future potential, we will often trim it down or swap into another stock. This is another advantage of active management over passive, when properly executed.IBD: What strategy do you have for lagging stocks that were put into the portfolio with expectations of superior gains but become a drag on portfolio performance?Dunkerley: Our sell discipline is well defined, and has helped us to outperform our Russell Midcap benchmark by controlling downside risk. We will sell or trim a stock when we detect fundamental deterioration in the business outlook, or if we determine that high valuation is an outsized risk. Each of our team members covers one or more sectors of the market, and we emphasize looking at the downside risks all of the time, but especially prior to each quarterly earnings report.So we do a lot of work detecting and analyzing downside risk factors in the stocks we own. It's an ongoing project, and we seek to avoid complacency regarding the fundamentals or the valuation. Keeping tabs on stocks we already own is the majority of the work we do typically.IBD: Turning to a few of your top holdings, DXC (DXC) has run up 50% since last April and is trading at all-time highs near 103, with a market cap of $29 billion. What do you like about the Hewlett Packard Enterprise spinoff? Sales are down and it's expected to post its first profit in five years. And does the stock have more room to run, or is it getting too rich — and its market cap too big?Dunkerley: A clearer picture of the earnings history can be found under the former ticker CSC. On a GAAP basis, the company was profitable four out of the past five years.  The top end of the market capitalization range of the Russell Midcap Index is currently near $40 billion, so a $29 billion market cap company is a midcap company as currently defined by Russell.We think the stock is cheap at under 7X total enterprise value to EBITDA if you look two years out, and Mike Lawrie, the CEO there has a great track record of delivering earnings progress, and positive shareholder actions such as special dividends and spinoffs.  If they successfully spinoff the government technology services business, that will be the second time he has accomplished a spinoff since 2015, back when it was named Computer Sciences and they spun off CSRA, another government services technology business.They also paid a $10.50 per share special dividend that year, so a repeat in 2018 of a special dividend would be sweet, but we can't forecast that.This is not a rapid top-line growth situation, it is more about rationalizing the business and managing it more efficiently, so margins can expand.  The recent merger with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Services gives Lawrie a bigger platform to work with. This is one of the best CEOs in America today, we think. So this is an investment in good management execution in what is a competitive technology services industry. We have owned this stock for many years and it has performed terrifically for shareholders.IBD: Abiomed has also run up, but it continues to post big earnings increases. What's the potential for this stock and what are the risks?Dunkerley: For the long term, we think Abiomed has great prospects.  They have a strong competitive position in small heart pumps for cardiac surgeries. We think the available possible total market (TAM) for these pumps could be as much as an estimated 500 thousand units globally over time, although we don't expect Abiomed to capture all of that market, as few companies ever do that and competition almost always surfaces at some point.We estimate their unit volumes just passed the 24,000 annualized run rate, so there is a long potential runway to this story. Their products are life savers in the hands of a well-trained cardiac surgeon, and they are expanding overseas.The risks in a stock like this are usually competition, which is developing slowly, high statistical valuation that can lead to a correction in the stock, or some type of unexpected flaw in the technology, or poor execution. Since their devices are approved and used in the U.S., Japan, and Germany, among others, and they have great sales and profit momentum, we view the latter risk as low. The stock has had a great run so it could be a better one to buy on pullbacks.IBD:  Atmos Energy (ATO) is 12% off its high and looking for a bottom. What's your thinking on this stock's prospects at this point?Dunkerley: This is a quality utility company, serving the lower-risk market of regulated gas utility service, with a service footprint in eight states including a large presence in Texas.  Regulated utilities offer a better safety profile in our opinion than many industries, so we have owned them in size from time to time when the cycle is right, such as when we expect interest rates to be stable or falling.Atmos has an excellent safety record, which helps them to gain favor with state regulators, and that has driven better than average earnings growth. They also maintain a conservative balance sheet, which we like.Atmos may be one of the few utilities that keeps a chunk of their tax savings from the recent corporate tax cuts, due to potential favorable treatment in Texas, where 70% of their assets are located. However, that is a developing situation and will depend on political outcomes, never a certainty.The main concern with the stock now is the direction of interest rates, which have moved higher.  So Atmos has moved down with the utility sector. Our weighting in utilities is underweight currently vs. the benchmark due to our outlook for higher interest rates.IBD: What happened to Arista Networks that it's 22% off its all-time high after beating earnings estimates? How do you handle a stock like this?Dunkerley: Arista is a share taker in the fast-growing switch market for cloud infrastructure. However after a big run-up, the stock has pulled back, possibly due to what we perceive as conservative guidance by management. We think Arista's advantages are in their software and management expertise, so we are confident in their long-term outlook. Enterprises are rapidly shifting workloads to the cloud and Arista's networking software was built for this environment.IBD: What's your favorite stock at this point, the one with potential to deliver the strongest performance?Dunkerley: For the near to intermediate term, I would have to go with DXC Technologies, our largest holding due to its low valuation and potential operating margin improvement, the potential for a spinoff, and or another special dividend. The global macroeconomic background is favorable for technology companies at the moment, with decent economic growth in many areas of the world, a change from a few years back.Finally, technology spending is a capital expenditure which we think can do well in the middle to late part of an economic cycle, since we believe companies are more likely to spend on technology systems when they feel better about their financial prospects. The recent corporate tax cut in the U.S. helps reinforce our point of view on this, we believe.  However, for the long-term, Abiomed may have the greatest upside potential due to reasons previously mentioned.IBD: Where did you serve in the Air Force, and are there any aspects of serving in the military that translate well to money management?Dunkerley: I served in B-52 bomber units, and was stationed in Maine and California. Military service is good at fostering teamwork and communications skills, and the ability to perform under stress. I enjoyed my time of service and learned a great deal.RELATED:Look Who's Replacing This Top Fidelity Manager During His LeaveWhat's The Stock Market Doing Now?

144,ES,"A pipeline blast in Libya combined with a bullish Saudi budget forecast boosted crude prices to levels not seen since mid-2015.Futures in New York and London touched the highest in more than two years after reports of an explosion at a pipeline operated by Waha Oil that carries crude to the Es Sider terminal in Libya. Waha output fell by 60,000-70,000 barrels a day, according to a person familiar with the situation. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia is said to expect oil revenue to jump about 80% by 2023.The blast is ""certainly something of a setback because Libya had been very steadily staying online,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund. ""It's just a reminder of the geopolitical risk premium that's going to haunt this market all of next year.""The explosion ""is a big thing"" that could push prices higher still amid a tighter supply picture, said Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York.Oil is poised for a fourth straight monthly price advance as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners including Russia cut output and promise to continue doing so through the end of next year. In the U.S., the uptick in boosting the rig count has slowed. Oil rigs are holding at 747 with no rigs added last week, according to Baker Hughes data Friday.West Texas intermediate for February delivery advanced $1.50 to $59.87 a barrel in afternoon trade Tuesday.As the year comes to a close, focus will also be on the restart of the Forties Pipeline System in the North Sea. Repairs of the pipeline at Red Moss, Scotland, are now mechanically complete and a small number of customers are now sending oil and gas through the pipeline at low rates, the company said Monday. The pipeline should be back to normal rates early in the new year.Even with the Forties Pipeline System working toward a restart, ""the lost barrels have added up, and we're seeing some strength here as a result,"" Kilduff said.RELATED:Oil Stocks Hit Buy Points

145,ES,"U.S. crude hit its highest mark since June 2015 on Tuesday, fueling oil stocks again. EOG Resources (EOG) broke out into buy range, while BP (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) looked to retake buy points.X U.S. crude closed up 2.6% to $59.97 per barrel, briefly hitting $60 intraday. Brent gained 2.7% to $67.02 a barrel, getting a lift on a Reuters report that an explosion in Libya took out a pipeline that feeds into the Es Sider port, losing about 90,000 barrel per day.EOG Resources broke out of a 108.95 entry point as shares climbed 2.15% to 109.41 on the stock market today, hitting a three-year high.  Volume was well below normal. Investors should look for breakouts to be in volume that's at least 40% above average. Overall market trading is far below average in the holiday-shortened week between Christmas and New Year's Day.Another concern: EOG's relative strength line has been lagging for the past year.

147,ES,"Shares of OLED display and lighting specialist Universal Display (OLED) climbed to a record high on Tuesday after getting a positive report from investment bank Goldman Sachs.Universal Display stock gained 4% to close at 142.20 on the stock market today. In intraday trading, the stock hit an all-time high of 145.30.XGoldman Sachs analyst Brian Lee reiterated his buy rating on the stock and raised his 12-month price target to 161 from 150.Lee believes Universal Display is close to commercializing blue phosphorescent OLED emitter materials for displays, joining the red, green and yellow materials it already sells.The blue OLED materials could be a ""game-changer"" for Universal Display, Lee said.""Our analysis suggests blue could add 16% to 66% to out-year EPS (earnings per share), which at current P/Es (price/earnings ratio) implies a stock worth as much as $178 to $254 per share,"" Lee said.IBD'S TAKE: Universal Display is currently ranked No. 2 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks.Universal Display is a key supplier of technology and materials for OLED displays and lighting. Its customers include OLED display makers like Samsung and LG Display (LPL). OLED displays are increasingly being used in smartphones, including Samsung's Galaxy S8 and Apple's (AAPL) upcoming iPhone X.""Looking ahead, we believe the potential addition of blue materials to Universal Display's product portfolio could more than double its revenue content per smartphone and drive yet another step-function in the company's growth rate in the medium to long term,"" Lee said.Organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays are seen as superior to liquid crystal display (LCD) screens in terms of color reproduction, contrast ratio, refresh rate and power efficiency.RELATED:Dolby, Universal Display Boosted By New Apple iPhonesApple iPhone 8 Seen Lifting Universal Display Sales, EarningsUniversal Display Stock Soars On Bullish Analyst Report

149,ES,"Invesco (IVZ) entered the exchange traded fund universe in 2006 when it acquired PowerShares, one of the top five ETF providers in the U.S.XWith more than $150 billion in assets under management, Invesco PowerShares offers more than 140 domestic and international ETFs.Its flagship PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ), which tracks the Nasdaq 100, remains near the top of the list among all U.S. exchange traded funds in terms of both assets under management and year-to-date gains.The $52.7 billion fund has returned more than 24% this year through Sept. 14, according to Morningstar Direct, nearly double the S&P 500's performance. It's also steadily outperformed the benchmark index over the past three, five, 10 and 15 years. PowerShares launched QQQ in March 1999.While QQQ accounts for a sizable chunk of Invesco's ETF assets, the Atlanta-based investment manager has been drawing attention for its smart-beta products. Smart beta — also known as strategic beta — adds an extra layer of analytics to traditional index investing. Rather than simply mimicking a benchmark index, smart-beta ETFs target bigger returns by selecting stocks based on dividends, volatility, size or other factors.For instance, PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV) screens for the 100 S&P 500 stocks with the lowest volatility. PowerShares Buyback Achievers (PKW) focuses on companies that have reduced their shares outstanding by 5% or more in the trailing 12 months.IBD'S TAKE: Looking for exchange traded ideas but not sure where to start? Check out the weekly ETF Leaders column and accompanying ETF Leaders list for some highly rated funds.PowerShares is considered a pioneer on the smart-beta front. In 2003 it introduced the first ""intelligent index"" ETFs, based on a quantitative analysis indexing method developed by PowerShares executives.Today, Invesco PowerShares' lineup includes more than 90 smart-beta ETFs. It has $45 billion in smart-beta assets, according to Invesco's website.We checked in with Dan Draper, managing director of Global ETFs for Invesco PowerShares, to find out more details about its smart-beta line of products, stock market outlook and what kinds of investments make sense in a rising interest rate environment. He joined Invesco in 2013 from Credit Suisse, where he was managing director and global head of ETFs.Draper's been busy helping grow PowerShares offerings. In August, Invesco expanded its global reach by completing its acquisition of Europe-based ETF provider Source. Invesco has already launched nine new ETFs this year, bringing its new product total to 33 since 2013.The full interview with Draper follows:IBD: What is the overall strategy for Invesco PowerShares?Draper: Our strategic priorities are threefold. First, we aim to lead and grow demand for smart-beta ETFs by providing differentiated and highly innovative content that's focused on smart-beta/factor investing.Second, we're working to strengthen our position in institutional markets. We see a real opportunity to expand in the institutional space given the increasing use of smart-beta products among institutional investors. We believe we are well positioned since we offer the broadest suite of smart-beta strategies, which provide access to track-tested tools needed to create tailored portfolios.Third, we're trying to selectively grow our international footprint while not losing focus on U.S. markets. We're seeking to increase global market share through our global brand and with products in targeted high-growth, non-U.S. markets. We are pursuing both organic and inorganic opportunities to achieve this growth.IBD: How much has PowerShares grown since its 2002 founding and 2006 acquisition by Invesco?Draper: PowerShares proprietary business has grown from $1.2 billion in assets under management on May 1, 2003, to $155 billion as of June 30, 2017.IBD: What sets your ETFs apart from the competition?Draper: Our product line consists of tools to help investors extract alpha, manage risk or gain targeted market exposures. We have always been a product innovator, launching many first-to-market strategies, including the first multifactor ETF, first single-factor ETF and first fundamental weight smart-beta fixed-income ETF.Our smart-beta ETF line is the broadest in the industry with 98 smart-beta offerings and has the longest track record — 73 ETFs have a five-year history. It's also the deepest with 21 smart-beta ETFs that each have at least $500 million in assets, and the second-largest in terms of most overall assets, at $47 billion.IBD: PowerShares has long offered factor-based investing, and now 'smart beta' is everywhere. Why do you think that's the case?Draper: PowerShares is a leader and innovator in this space, and we offer more than 90 smart-beta ETFs. Smart-beta and factor-based investing represents an innovative approach to investing that provides investors transparent, low-cost and efficient exposure to strategies. These portfolios provide a wider toolset than traditional cap-weighted portfolios and allow for customization by clients in meeting their objectives.IBD: Any thoughts on what will be the next big trend among ETF providers?Draper: As we look ahead in the ETF industry, providing more-efficient solutions for clients will be key. The combination of active and passive strategies with a digital experience will enable investors to more efficiently utilize ETFs in their portfolios. Additionally, we expect to see smart-beta portfolios become an even more crucial component of investors overall asset allocation strategies.IBD: What are your most popular ETFs/strategies in terms of assets and inflows this year?Draper: Our PowerShares fixed-income and factor strategies were the most popular as of Aug. 30, based on assets under management and net flows. Year to date, our net flows have been driven by fixed income, which gathered $4.3 billion. Short-duration products led our fixed-income flows. Factor and low-volatility products are also seeing strong inflows. For example, year to date, our low-volatility suite has gathered more than $550 million.Below are the top five PowerShares ETFs by inflows in 2017, which are also our top five in AUM with a different order (as of 8/25/17):IBD: What is your outlook for the U.S. and global stock markets?Draper: We expect the weaker U.S. dollar will become a driving force in the market during the second half of this year. The weaker dollar will support profit growth in the U.S., and will boost emerging-market economies by reducing their debt burden in local currency terms, as they often borrow in dollars.We also think the weaker dollar will push up inflation later this year, putting upward pressure on long-term interest rates and, thereby, potentially creating some volatility for high price-to-earnings (P/E) stocks.IBD: Are there certain types of ETFs investors should focus on in a rising interest rate environment?Draper: PowerShares Variable Rate Investment Grade (VRIG) and PowerShares Variable Rate Preferred are two favorites for income, and PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility and PowerShares S&P 500 Enhanced Value (SPVU) are favorites for domestic equity as value stocks' lower P-Es may fare better than high P-E stocks as rates rise. And, since rising rates often contribute to volatility in equities, so SPLV would serve one well.IBD: What's your take on the long-standing active vs. passive debate?Draper: We believe portfolios can include actively managed funds, smart-beta strategies and traditional passive approaches that are all intentionally chosen and allocated with a client's goals in mind.IBD: Has increased competition pressured PowerShares to lower its expense ratios?Draper: We continually monitor our product line to ensure our ETFs are appropriately priced.

154,ES,"The Q1 earnings season is past the halfway mark, with 267 S&P 500 members having already reported their quarterly results as of Apr 27. Going by the positive trends, the first quarter is poised to record the strongest earnings and revenue growth in seven years. Earnings for the S&P 500 members that have already reported are up 25.1% from the same period last year on 10.0% higher revenues, with 76.8% beating EPS estimates and 73.8% surpassing revenues.Per our latest Earnings Preview report, overall earnings in the first quarter for all the S&P 500 members are expected to be up 22.6% on 8.4% growth in revenues.Amid the positive earnings outlook for the first quarter, let’s concentrate on the domestic-focused matured Zacks Utility sector. This sector, along with 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors, is likely to come up with improved year-over-year earnings. Currently, only the Autos sector is likely to register an earnings decline.The Utility sector’s earnings are expected to increase 13.9% year over year on 1.4% growth in revenues, thanks to stable performance by most of the utilities. The need for heating, stemming from cold weather conditions, and increased demand for electricity aided the utilities. Additionally, tax reforms also helped the utilities in lowering their tax burden substantially.Utilities, apart from investing in generating plants that produce electricity with low and negligible amount of emissions, are also focused on improving and upgrading transmission and distribution networks. Utilities are also investing in power storage facilities and guiding investors for efficient usage of electricity.  However, the rate-sensitive capital-intensive utility stocks are also accommodating the rate hikes. Notably, the Fed rate has now been raised for the sixth time (latest in March 2018) since the first hike in December 2015.Let’s take a look at the Utility stocks, scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings on May 2and see how things are shaping up for the upcoming results.Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (PNW  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 90% in the last reported quarter.

156,ES,"Connecticut Water Service  announced that it has received a proposal from Eversource Energy (ES  -  Free Report) for acquisition. The offer was for $63.50 per share in cash and/or in Eversource common shares, however, Connecticut Water has rejected the offer.  Connecticut Water remained committed to the earlier offer made by SJW Group (SJW  -  Free Report) for merger (Read More: Connecticut Water Service to Merge With SJW Group)Why Connecticut Water Rejected the Offer?Connecticut Water remained committed to the earlier offer made by SJW Group, citing that it will be a merger of equals, and offer better opportunity for growth and return to shareholders. In the last five years, Connecticut Water has delivered 154% total return to the company's shareholders, while SJW Group returned 145% to its shareholders; both much higher compared with Eversource Energy’s return of 57% in the same time frame.The combined company will maintain a strong ""A"" credit profile and is expected to pursue a share repurchase program of up to $100 million, increasing the shareholders’ value. The financial flexibility of the combined company will allow it to carry on with infrastructure upgrades, replacement of old mains and pipelines, and provide high-quality services to its customers.In addition, the merger will be accretive to earnings of each company, and there will be ample financial flexibility to expand operation and compete with water utility operators in the fragmented industry.Why Eversource Made the Offer?Eversource Energy is an energy company and has now started to venture in the water utility space through the acquisition of Aquarion Water Company. The fragmented water utility space offers growth opportunity from the current levels.Aquarion Water Company’s service territory is in close proximity to Connecticut Water’s service territory, so the acquisition of the latter would have expanded the service territory in the Northeast and provided superior services to the customers.Bigger PictureConsolidation is the need of the hour in the fragmented U.S. water utility space. The water utility infrastructure in the United States is getting old and needs ample investments, easier for bigger players to make. Consolidation would therefore drive the necessary infrastructure overhauls that have become imperative for the industry at large.Another water utility, American Water Works Company (AWK  -  Free Report) is very active and keeps on making strategic acquisitions to expand its footprint. In 2017, the company added 39,514 customers via acquisitions. American Water Works is in discussions to acquire another 23,000 customers through acquisitions.Price MovementYear to date, Connecticut Water has returned 13% against its industry's decline of 7.4%.Zacks RankConnecticut Water Service has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

161,ES,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Eversource Energy (ES  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Eversource Energy is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ES in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 77 cents per share for ES, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 76 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ES, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.66% heading into earnings season.Eversource Energy Price and EPS Surprise Eversource Energy Price and EPS Surprise | Eversource Energy QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

162,ES,"Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 23, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the utility’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.38%. However, Public Service Enterprise outperformed the same in the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 4.94%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Public Service Enterprise is likely to beat earnings this quarter. Notably, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Public Service Enterprise has both these attributes, as mentioned below:Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.92%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Public Service Enterprise carries a Zacks Rank #3.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayIn June 2017, Public Service Enterprise submitted the planned update to its Energy Strong cost recovery petition, to include Energy Strong investments in service as of May 31, 2017. This filing requested estimated annual increases in electric and gas revenues of $16 million and $2 million, respectively. Last August, the BPU approved these raised rates effective Sep 1, 2017.Moreover, in June 2017, the company made its annual Basic Gas Supply Services (BGSS) filing with the Board of Public Utility (BPU) requesting an increase in the BGSS rate from approximately 34 cents to 37 cents per therm, effective Oct 1, 2017. Therefore, we may expect these to duly get reflected in the company’s fourth-quarter results in the form of improved sales as well as earnings growth.In line with this, for the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 56 cents per share reflects year-over-year growth of 3.7%. Meanwhile, the same for revenues is pegged at $2.36 billion, depicting an increase of 12.8%.On the flip side, the unemployment rate in Public Service Enterprise’s service territories is worse than the national average. A deteriorating economy is likely to lower the utility demand in the state, which in turn may weigh on the company’s quarterly performance.Nevertheless, earlier-than-expected snowfall in December 2017 in New Jersey drove demand for electricity substantially in the city. This in turn is expected to drive Public Service Enterprise’s yet-to-be-reported results.Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated Quote Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few other utility stocks which have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Edison International (EIX  -  Free Report) will report fourth-quarter results on Feb 22.

In the third quarter, the utility company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 14.77%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this earnings season.Factors to ConsiderAlliant Energy’s earnings are expected to gain from its robust capital expenditure plans and constructive regulatory decisions.

164,ES,"Eversource Energy (ES  -  Free Report) has reaffirmed its original offer to acquire Connecticut Water Service, Inc.  at $63.50 per share in cash or Eversource shares. Eversource’s earlier offer was rejected by management of Connecticut Water Service, citing that it was inferior to the offer made by SJW Group (SJW  -  Free Report).

Connecticut Water Service’s closing share price on Jun 13, 2018 was $64.59, higher than Eversource’s offer of $63.50, making the offer unimpressive.

The acquisition of Connecticut Water would have further expanded its service territories and operations in the Northeast and provided superior services to customers.Merger and Acquisition in the Water SpaceThe final outcome is still unclear and it is yet to know which company will have the last laugh on Connecticut Water Service’ acquisition deal.

165,ES,"WEC Energy Group (WEC  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results before the market opens on Oct 26. In the second quarter, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 6.78%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this earnings season.Factors to ConsiderWEC Energy expects its earnings in the third quarter to be in the range of 63-67 cents per share, assuming normal weather, which is lower than the year-ago quarter earnings of 69 cents. Earnings in the last year quarter benefited from weather that was 43% warmer than normal.Nearly 99% of its earnings come from regulated operations, which provided excellent visibility on its future performance. The economic growth in its service territories and systematic investment in regulated operation is expected to boost the bottom line. WEC Energy is currently providing services to a higher number of customers than the last-year level, which is expected to have a positive impact on demand and earnings.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that WEC Energy is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is -0.25%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: WEC Energy’s Zacks Rank #3, when combined with a negative Earnings ESP makes a beat unlikely this quarter.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.WEC Energy Group, Inc.

166,ES,"Entergy Corporation (ETR  -  Free Report), primarily engaged in electric power production and retail distribution of power, is scheduled to report its financial results on Oct 24, before the market opens.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Entergy is likely to beat earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), which have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is +3.94%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is at $2.25, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at $2.16. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Entergy carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this quarter.Note that we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision.Now, the factors influencing Entergy's quarterly results are elaborated below.Entergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Entergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Entergy Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayDuring the second-quarter earnings call, Entergy had said that there were non-recurring items in 2016 that will lead to a decline of 5 cents in its third-quarter earnings.The company also expects to continue witnessing higher nuclear spending that will increase staffing levels to be consistent with industry norms and execute on projects resultantly improving the reliability. This, in turn, is expected to decrease earnings about 20 cents in the second half of the year, about two thirds of which will be in the third quarter.Apart from this, other non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses are expected to deteriorate third-quarter earnings by 10 cents. Overall, the performance in the to-be-reported quarter is expected to be poor compared with the year-ago quarter. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the yet-to-be reported quarter’s earnings moved down 6.5%.On the brighter note, this New Orleans, LA-based company’s service territories witnessed above-average temperatures during the quarter. This should in fact lead to increased electric sales in these regions, which in turn, is expected to boost the top line. May be that’s why our Consensus Estimate called for revenues of $3.13 billion in the third quarter, implying a year-over-year increase of 0.1%, for Entergy.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other operators in the electric utility space worth considering, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.NiSource, Inc.

169,ES,"The Q2 earnings season is fast approaching its core. As of Jul 26, 171 S&P 500 members came up with their quarterly earnings. Total earnings for these companies are up 8.8% from the same period last year on 3.4% higher revenues. 78.9% of the companies beat EPS estimates while 70.8% topped revenue estimates.It is going to be another busy week with nearly 800 companies – including 183 S&P 500 members – expected to come up with earnings results. Combining results of the reported index members (171 members till Jul 26) with the remaining 329 members of S&P 500, earnings are estimated to improve 8.7% on 4.7% higher revenues.Let us now focus on the utility sector, which is characterized by its defensive nature and domestic orientation. Earnings are expected to drop 2.7% this season.The utility sector is capital-intensive. These companies need huge capital to set up generation facilities, and transmission and distribution infrastructure. They also require considerable funds to maintain and upgrade the existing systems in order to meet emission-control standards. Utilities have been benefiting from the rock-bottom interest rate environment. However, the Federal Reserve has raised the rates twice in 2017 – in March and June. This will definitely hurt the utilities. The Fed has maintained its forecast for one more rate hike in 2017.With the rising interest rates, the stable, regular dividend payer utilities will face strong competition from bonds as these provide higher returns, which will make them a more attractive option for the investors.The U.S. coal-based utilities got a respite with President Trump’s decision to repeal the Climate Power Plan. Moreover, Trump has walked out of the Paris Climate Agreement.    Four out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks coverage universe are expected to witness an earnings decline this season.

The economic growth in its service territories and strategic acquisitions might help to boost the bottom line.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that WEC Energy is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 59 cents.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.WEC Energy Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  WEC Energy Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | WEC Energy Group, Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: WEC Energy’s Zacks Rank #3, when combined with its Earnings ESP of 0.00%, makes a beat unlikely this quarter.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies from the industry that you may want to consider instead, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The AES Corporation (AES  -  Free Report) is expected to release second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 8. The company has an Earnings ESP of +20.0% and a Zacks Rank #2.

174,ES,"U.S. utility provider, Avista Corp. (AVA  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has signed a deal with its Canadian counterpart, Hydro One Ltd. Per the terms, Hydro One will take over Avista for a total cash of $5.3 billion. The merger is expected to close in the second half of 2018, and is still subject to approval from common shareholders and various regulatory authorities.According to most of the media sources, Avista’s shares took a 17–19% surge soon after the deal surfaced, in after-hour trading.Details of the MergerThe deal is aimed at creating one of North America’s largest regulated utilities, which will serve more than two million customers across the region. The new company will set up headquarters in Toronto.On completion of the merger, Avista will keep its existing corporate headquarters in Spokane, WA. The company’s management team and employees will also retain their positions. Moreover, the company will go on with its operations in the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and Alaska as a standalone utility.Further, Avista’s operations will continue to be supervised by its own board of directors. This will ensure the protection of the interests of the Pacific Northwest and the communities it serves.Benefits of the MergerAs a result of the merger, Avista’s shareholders will receive $53 in cash per common share, which reflects a 24% premium to the share price as of Jul 18, 2017. The deal will be accretive to Hydro One’s earnings per share in the mid-single digits in the first full year of operation.From a strategic point of view, this acquisition deal will combine two industry-leading regulated utilities with over 230 years of collective operational experience and combined assets worth $25.4 billion. This, in turn, will enable the new entity to provide safer, reliable and high quality energy with a greater scale, diversity and financial flexibility.This merger is a notable one from an economic point of view as well, as it will involve no employee layoff from either of the two companies. Moreover, the rates at which customers of both Hydro One and Avista receive their electricity, will remain unchanged.Our TakeEnergy services in North America were operated under monopoly conditions throughout most of the 20th century. Following Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) Energy Policy Act of 1992, deregulation moved into the electricity market in the region. This, in turn, promoted a healthy competitive business environment, encouraging more energy providers to foray into this market.In recent times, the states in the region, particularly those located in the Pacific Northwest, have been experiencing rapid customer and economic growth. To cater to this burgeoning market in here and expand into new lines of regulated utility business outside of its home country, Hydro One chose to take over Avista that has a strong presence in this side of the U.S.We believe this is in sync with the recent trend of continued interest from Canadian investors in US-based utility providers as has been witnessed in the first quarter of 2017. Per a report by PWC, there were two inbound deals in the quarter representing 56% of total value in the North American power and utilities deals.Moreover, the combined expertise of these two companies will allow the new entity to deliver cost-efficient and more effective utility services to its customers. Further, since the new entity will not levy the cost of this deal on its customers by raising electricity rates, it may also attract more consumers, apart from boosting investors’ optimism in the stock’s growth expectations.Price PerformanceOver the last one year, Avista has outperformed the Zacks categorized Utility- Electric Power industry. During this period, the company’s shares gained 0.3%, compared with the industry’s loss of 1.6%. This could be because the company’s strong financials enable it to execute investor-friendly measures at regular intervals. Avista also poses strong competition to its peers like Atlantica Yield PLC , Eversource Energy (ES  -  Free Report) and Alliant Energy Corp. (LNT  -  Free Report).Zacks RankAvista currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.3 Top Picks to Ride the Hottest Tech Trend                   Zacks just released a Special Report to guide you through a space that has already begun to transform our entire economy...Last year, it was generating $8 billion in global revenues.

175,ES,"Debt financing is nothing new in the world of investment and only a fortunate few can avoid it. Most corporates resort to debt financing to ensure smooth business operations. This is because companies do not have unlimited funds and they need to boost their financial resources from time to time to expand operations.In fact, given the easy availability and affordability of debt compared to equity, in the majority of matured economies, the debt market is bigger than the equity market in terms of market capitalization. America – the richest economy in the world – is the biggest borrower too.However, resorting to debt is still considered a taboo as it carries the burden of interest payments.In this context, it is imperative to note that the debt scenario in the U.S. is quite disturbing at this moment. Huge spending on wars, big tax cuts and stimulating economic programs have all added to the nation’s burden over the years. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the debt held by the public will rise to 150% of the economy’s GDP in 2047 from 77% currently.Nevertheless, this should not dissuade investors from investing in stocks as debt has been a part of the U.S. economy since its foundation. What investors need to do is to follow a prudent investment strategy and choose stocks that are burdened with lesser amount of debt.Herein comes the significance of financial leverage ratio. This ratio measures the extent of financial leverage, or the extent of debt a company bears. Several leverage ratios have been developed historically for this purpose, with debt-to-equity ratio being the most popular among them.Analyzing Debt-to-EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A lower debt-to-equity ratio implies a more financially stable business, thereby making it a more worthy investment opportunity.As debt-ridden companies are more prone to bankruptcy in times of financial crisis, the very foundation of making safe investment is to avoid high-leverage stocks.With the market gearing up for second-quarter releases, investors tend to get attracted to stocks exhibiting solid earnings growth, overlooking the debt on their balance sheet. Therefore to avoid huge losses we would urge investors to go for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratio.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned discussion, it is imperative for a sensible investor to choose stocks that have a low debt-to-equity ratio.However, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy): No matter whether market conditions are good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.VGMScore of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of ‘A’ or ‘B’ when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here are five of the 17 stocks that made it through the screen.Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (LPX  -  Free Report): It manufactures and sells building products primarily for use in new home construction, repair and remodeling, and outdoor structures, as well as light industrial and commercial construction. The company carries a Zacks Rank #1 and delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 5.4% in the trailing four quarters.Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report): This largest ship builder in the U.S. engages in designing, building, overhauling, and repairing of ships.

176,ES,"Aqua America (WTR  -  Free Report) announced that its subsidiary, Aqua Pennsylvania, has reached a joint settlement agreement to buy the wastewater assets of Limerick Township. If the agreement is approved by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, it will add nearly 5,400 wastewater customers to Aqua America’s customer base.Aqua America has been expanding its customer base through acquisitions, partnerships and organic growth. In 2017, the company was able to add 10,854 new connections through organic growth and acquisitions. Aqua America further expects to add 16,325 new connections in 2018 through acquisitions, out of which 2,259 customers are already added in the first quarter through three completed acquisitions.Aqua Pennsylvania already invested in multiple projects to improve quality and reliability of its water and wastewater services in the state. The new customers who will join the 1.4 million people the company already serves in Pennsylvania will get the benefits from the new projects.Consolidation Will Help the Water SpaceWater and wastewater operation is highly fragmented in the United States, and a large number of operators are serving only a few hundred customers. It becomes very difficult for these small operators or municipalities to make large investments to upgrade and expand their water and wastewater infrastructure.It is easier for large companies to make arrangement for funds to carry out these major overhauls. Consolidation would therefore drive the necessary infrastructure overhauls that have become imperative for the industry at large.American Water Works (AWK  -  Free Report) is one of the largest water and wastewater service providers in the United States, and continues to widen its market footprint through strategic acquisitions. During the first four months of 2018, the company added 3,689 customers through five completed acquisitions and nearly 1,500 via organic initiatives.Rising Interest in the Water SpaceThe water utility industry offers excellent growth opportunities and as a consequence, we are noticing a rising interest in this space, shown by companies that were earlier focused primarily on other businesses.On Mar 15, 2018, Connecticut Water Service  received an offer from SJW Group (SJW  -  Free Report) to merge with the latter. This deal announcement has awakened a lot of interest in the water utility space and both the parties received bids for takeover from different companies.Connecticut Water Service received an offer from Eversource Energy (ES  -  Free Report), while SJW Group received a bid from California Water Service Group (CWT  -  Free Report). Despite the new offer, management of Connecticut Water Service and SJW Group remained committed to the original arrangement and both rejected the subsequent offers.Recently, Connecticut Water Service and SJW Group announced an amendment in their merger agreement. This amendment includes a new go-shop provision that will allow Connecticut Water to explore offers of an alternative merger, acquisition or other strategic transaction.

178,ES,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Eversource Energy (ES  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 4.3% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is ES due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Eversource Q1 Earnings Meet Estimates, Revenues RiseEversource Energy reported first-quarter 2018 operating earnings of 85 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings improved 3.7% year over year.Total RevenuesEversource’s first-quarter revenues of $2,288 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,106 million by 8.6% and improved 8.7% from the year-ago figure of $2,105 million.Highlights of the ReleaseIn the reported quarter, natural gas distribution increased 4.9% to 43,179 million cubic feet of gas.Operating expenses increased nearly 15% year over year to $1,845.4 million, primarily owing to higher expenses from purchased power, fuel and transmission and depreciation expenses.Operating income was down 11.7% to $442.5 million and interest expenses were up 17.1% year over year at $121.1 million.Net income in the reported quarter was $271.4 million, up 3.9% from the year-ago quarter.Segmental PerformanceElectric Distribution: This segment’s earnings declined 8.7% year over year to $104.2 million. The decline was primarily on account of sale of generation assets, higher depreciation, property tax, operations and maintenance expense, which was partially offset by higher electric distribution margins.Electric Transmission: The segment’s earnings were up 14% to $107.4 million. Higher transmission earnings were primarily due to Eversource’s additional investment in its electric transmission system.Natural Gas Distribution: The segment’s earnings improved 13.8% to $57.8 million. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to strong sales, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses.Water Distribution: Eversource’s water distribution segment, which was created after it acquired Aquarion Water Company in December 2017, earned $1.5 million in the first quarter of 2018.Eversource Parent & Other Companies: The segment incurred a loss of $1.4 million against the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $0.4 million.GuidanceEversource reaffirmed 2018 earnings guidance in the range of $3.20-$3.30. Long-term earnings growth is projected in the range of 5-7% for the long term.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter.Eversource Energy Price and Consensus  Eversource Energy Price and Consensus | Eversource Energy QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, ES has a subpar Growth Score of D, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.The company's stock is suitable solely for value based on our styles scores.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of this revision looks promising.

179,ES,"Edison International (EIX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings results on Feb 22, after the closing bell.Last quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 7.52%. It has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 9.08%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Edison International is likely to beat earnings this quarter. Notably, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Edison International possesses both these attributes, as mentioned below:Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.44%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: It currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which along with a positive Earnings ESP increases the chance of surprise prediction.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayMultiple wind-driven wildfires that ravaged through parts of California in December 2017, affected customers and electric service across the service territory of Southern California Edison, a subsidiary of Edison International. This in turn is likely to have an adverse impact on the fourth-quarter results.In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Edison International’s fourth-quarter earnings reflects 7.9% decline year over year, on 0.2% lower revenues worth $2.88 billion.On a bright note, the company hiked quarterly dividend rate by 11.5%, for shareholders of record at the close of business on Dec 29, 2017. This represents the strong cash generation capacity that Edison International boasts. We anticipate its soon-to-be-reported quarter’s result to duly reflect the company’s efficiency in terms of reporting a stable cash inflow through operating activities.Edison International Price and EPS Surprise Edison International Price and EPS Surprise | Edison International QuoteOther Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few other utility stocks which have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Public Service Enterprise Group (PEG  -  Free Report) will report fourth-quarter results on Feb 23.

180,ES,"Even though the northern part of the United States usually experiences extreme climatic conditions during winter, this year has been especially harsh owing to a snowy nor'easter ""bomb cyclone."" The cyclone hit the coasts of Florida and Southeast United States on Jan 3, and South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Delaware and New Jersey the next day.The bitter cold wave enveloped the entire East Coast as well as the MidWest of the United States, causing heavy snowfall in the East Coast from Maine to North Carolina (as per Reuters), resulting in wide-spread power cuts. Extensive outages were reported in these regions, which might have led the broader Utility sector’s performance to dip. Evidently, the Utility sector dropped 1.4% since the beginning of 2018.Impact on the EconomyBomb cyclone spurred heating oil and natural gas demand in turn raising their price. Per The New York Times report, the cost of residential heating oil at the end of December 2017 surged 13% to $2.92 a gallon, compared with the same period in 2016.Being the major residential and commercial heating fuel in the Northeast and most widely used by power plants, U.S. natural gas demand also remained near record highs last week. Consequently, U.S. spot natural gas and power prices on Jan 4 rose to their highest in years in several regions (as per Reuters).The catastrophic back-to-back hurricanes and wildfires in 2017 in the United States have already led to a damage of $306 billion. The extreme winter storm and the cold waves, expected to continue for a while per the National Weather service, along with other catastrophes that usually take place each year, are likely to result in similar if not more damage.Impact on UtilitiesThe severe storm followed by heavy snowfall and high winds initially caused electricity outages in almost 80,000 homes and businesses on the U.S. Atlantic coast. Power outages have also hit thousands of customers in Florida and the Southeast.Per a North American Electric Reliability Council report, plants in the Southern part of the United States suffered outages, as they weren't designed to operate at such low temperatures. Meanwhile, outages at coal-fired facilities and problems delivering natural gas to plants in the 13-state region that includes Pennsylvania and New Jersey have also affected the system adversely.Although the storm dented electric utility services at varied parts of the nation, none of the major utilities reported any notable damages in their generation fleet or power generating system, thanks to their advanced infrastructural development. In fact, utilities in the Southeast have restored service to some customers who were hit by the storm overnight.However natural gas pipeline constraints in the Northeast have been posing challenges to the grid operator. Currently, natural gas accounts for about one-third of U.S. power generation, roughly on par with coal. However, there is significant opposition to new pipeline construction in the densely populated Northeast, which sits just above the major natural gas-producing region in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia.This becomes an issue during cold snaps, when residences that rely on natural gas for home heating, compete for supplies with power plants. Therefore, utility service providers in this region are expected to suffer a big blow from this storm.3 Utilities to WatchDuring the bomb cyclone, utility providers in the nation tried their best to restore the system. However, depending on the extent of the damage as well as severity of weather conditions prevalent in the outage sites, complete restoration was not possible. This may have led the below mentioned utilities to suffer in the equity market immediately following the devastating storm.Duke Energy Corp. (DUK  -  Free Report): This company is primarily engaged in electric power production and retail distribution of power. It carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Thousands of Duke Energy customers in North and South Carolina suffered power cuts over the week (according to the utility’s online outage tracker). The company appealed to customers to lower their energy use citing extreme cold temperatures that can put pressure on their electricity system.The company’s share price dropped 3.4% on a year-to-date basis, underperforming the broader sector’s decline of 1.4%.Eversource Energy (ES  -  Free Report): This company transmits and delivers electricity and natural gas. It also carries a Zacks Rank #3.High population creates problem for new pipeline construction for natural gas in New England, wherein natural gas accounted for half of the region’s electric power in 2016. National Fuel warned that it expects outages in New England that could take multiple days to restore. With Eversource being the largest energy provider in the region, the storm has affected its share price.The company’s share price dropped 2.2% on a year-to-date basis, underperforming the broader sector’s decline of 1.4%.Entergy Corp. (ETR  -  Free Report): This company is primarily engaged in electric power production and retail distribution of power. It carries a Zacks Rank #3.The only nuclear plant in Massachusetts was shut because of the failure of a line that connects the reactor to the power grid. Entergy Corp, which operates the Pilgrim Station, has not yet said when the station will restart.The company’s share price dropped 1.6% on a year-to-date basis, underperforming the broader sector’s decline of 1.4%.To Sum UpIn general, extreme weather conditions provide an impetus to utility services demand which in turn raise utility bills. Therefore, utility providers should have gained in the United States, following the terrific snowy storm. However, the share price performance of the stocks shows a different picture.Nevertheless, the increased utility bills that consumers have already paid, relative to the peak demand at the time of this storm, can be expected to get reflected in the improved Q1 results for these utilities as well as others. Further, once weather conditions starts to improve from the second half of January, as expected by weather reports, these utilities will be able to restore the outages full-fledged, post which their share price may take a positive rebound. In fact, each of them carrying a Zacks Rank #3 is a further indication that these stocks are worth adding in your watchlist.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

182,ES,"Connecticut Water Service, Inc.  and SJW Group (SJW  -  Free Report) announced an amendment in their merger agreement. This amendment includes a new go-shop provision that will allow Connecticut Water Service to explore offers of an alternative merger, acquisition or other strategic transaction. Per the amendment, Connecticut Water Service is permitted to review and negotiate any alternative proposals received from third parties until 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on Jul 14, 2018.Original Offer and Change in ScenarioOn Mar 15, 2018, Connecticut Water Service received an offer from SJW Group to merge with the latter. Per the proposal, each shareholder of Connecticut Water Service was offered 1.1375 shares of SJW Group common stock, the equivalent of $64.72 per share based on SJW Group’s closing price as of Apr 25, 2018.However, the merger scenario changed when Connecticut Water Service received an acquisition offer from Eversource Energy (ES  -  Free Report), a company primarily focused on energy business. Eversource made a proposal of $63.50 per share to each shareholder of Connecticut Water Service. The bid to acquire Connecticut Water Service was unsuccessful.Despite showing loyalty to the previous offer, the current amendment in the merger agreement will allow Connecticut Water to explore all viable options and decide on the proposal that will be the best for the company and its shareholders.Another Opportunity for Eversource & Others?The amendment in agreement provided a fresh opportunity to Eversource Energy. The company will have to make a fresh offer for acquiring Connecticut Water, which is needed to be better than that of SJW Group and return more value to the shareholders of the company.Eversource has an advantage over others, as its existing water assets via acquisition of Aquarion Water Company is in close proximity to Connecticut Water’s service territory. The acquisition of Connecticut Water would have expanded the service territory in the Northeast and provided superior services to the customers.Other third parties might join the race to acquire Connecticut Water Service. One potential candidate could be American Water Works Company (AWK  -  Free Report). The company has a strategy to expand its market share through acquisitions and already has operations in some states in the Northeast. The acquisition of Connecticut Water Service could further expand the operation of the company in the Northeast states.What is Essential for the Water Utilities?The water utility industry offers excellent growth opportunities and as a consequence, we are noticing a rising interest in this space, shown by companies that were earlier focused primarily on other businesses.We have noticed mergers and acquisitions in this highly-fragmented water utility space. The aging water and wastewater infrastructure of the United States requires investment of billions of dollars for upgradation.It is easier for large companies to make arrangement for funds to carry out these major overhauls. Consolidation would therefore drive the necessary infrastructure overhauls that have become imperative for the industry at large.Price MovementIn the past three months, Connecticut Water has returned 29.9% against its industry's decline of 1.1%.Zacks RankCurrently, Connecticut Water Service has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

183,ES,"American Water Works Company Inc. (AWK  -  Free Report) continues its tradition of expanding services throughout the United States via acquisitions. The company announced that its subsidiary, Pennsylvania American Water entered into an agreement to acquire Exeter Township’s wastewater system for $96 million. This acquisition will increase American Water Works’ customer volume by 9,000.Pennsylvania American Water has been providing wastewater services to nearly 70% residents of Exeter Township. Courtesy of this deal, the company will be able to provide wastewater services to all the residents of Exeter Township. The company will invest nearly $3 million to upgrade the aging wastewater systems of the township. The company expects to close the acquisition by the end of first-quarter 2019, subject to regulatory approvals.Exeter Township decided to sell its systems to American Water Works’ unit, as it needed substantial capital investments to upgrade and was unbale to do so on its own.Consolidation in the Fragmented Water SpaceConsolidation is the need of the hour in the fragmented U.S. water utility space. Water Utility operation is highly fragmented in the United States and there are a very small number of operators serving only a few hundred customers. It becomes very difficult for these small operators or municipalities to make large investments to upgrade and expand their water and wastewater infrastructure.It is easier for large companies to make arrangement for funds to carry out these major overhauls. Consolidation would therefore drive the necessary infrastructure overhauls that have become imperative for the industry at large.American Water Works continues to widen its market footprint through strategic acquisitions. During the first four months of 2018, the company added 3,689 customers through five completed acquisitions and nearly 1,500 via organic initiatives. The company is already in discussion to acquire 15 more companies, which will add another 47,186 customers.Another water utility, Connecticut Water Service  announced that it has entered into a definite agreement to merge with SJW Group (SJW  -  Free Report) in an all-stock transaction. The combined company will become one of the largest water and wastewater service providers in the United States and serve more than 1.5 million customers in multiple states.Rising Interest in the Water SpaceThe water utility industry offers excellent growth opportunities and as a consequence, we are noticing a rising interest in this space, shown by companies that were earlier focused primarily on other businesses. Eversource Energy (ES  -  Free Report) was primarily focused on energy business but forayed into water business via acquisition of Aquarion Water Company in December 2017. It had the intention to expand its water operations through more strategic acquisitions. The company made an unsuccessful bid to acquire Connecticut Water Service.

Lastquarter, the company reported positive earnings surprise of 5.88%.Let’s see how things are shaping prior tothis announcement.Factors to Consider                                                                    Eversource distributes electricity to retail customers through electric distribution segment that contributed 52.8% to the bottom line in second-quarter 2017. The company’s substantial gain last quarter can be attributed to low operations and maintenance (O&M) costs and higher demand revenues. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $2,076 million, reflecting an increase of 17.8% sequentially. Additionally, the revenues also reflect a year-over-year increase of 1.8% from the prior-year quarter.Eversource successfully served approximately 3.7 million customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire during second-quarter 2017 compared with3.6 million in last year’s quarter. Notably, we can expect the company to continue to expand with its existing customers and also benefit from improved demand in this quarter as well.The company continued to make progress on several of its transmission projects in the third quarter. However, thedecision to drop its Access Northeast Pipeline plan due to regulatory uncertainty, is likely tohave an adverse impact on growth prospects.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Eversource is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Eversource has an Earnings ESP of -0.55%.

Instead, it shifted its focus to unwinding its massive balance sheet which currently amounts to $4.5 trillion. The central bank indicated that the process of offloading the bond holdings it had built up in the years immediately after the Great Recession will begin in September.Such a move also amounts to monetary tightening of another kind. But markets have chosen to focus on the Fed’s move to recognize that inflation has remained low, belying its earlier expectations. This development has given rise to speculation that another rate hike may not occur this year after all. Given such a scenario, investing in stocks benefiting from a soft interest rate environment may continue to be a prudent option.Focus Shifts to Balance Sheet TrimWith the Fed staying away from a rate hike at the end of its meeting, the spotlight is now squarely on the unwinding of the central bank’s massive balance sheet. The language of the Fed’s statement indicates that it will begin this process around September.The massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet consists of Treasury securities worth around $2.46 trillion and $1.77 trillion of mortgage backed securities. Most of these securities were accumulated as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) in the years following the recession of 2008.Initially, the Fed plans to offload securities worth $10 billion a month which will increase within a quarter to $50 billion. Even after this cycle is completed, Fed officials project that the balance sheet will still be larger than $2 trillion. The Fed Chair and other key officials have repeatedly indicated that this process should not disrupt market activity. However, concerns that poor demand for such bonds could result in an increase in rates continue to linger.Inflation Concerns Take Center StageBut such concerns have been overshadowed by the Fed’s change in stance on inflation. The central bank’s statement dropped the word “somewhat” from its June statement instead choosing to directly state that inflation continues to remain under 2%. This only represents a slight shift but is significant because it acknowledges a negative perception about one of the Fed’s key objectives.Data released earlier has already raised such concerns on several occasions. Currently, average hourly wage growth refuses to rise above 2.5%. Meanwhile, the Price Consumption Expenditures index or PCE, also referred to as the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, remains at 1.4%. What is noteworthy is that the labor market continues to improve, and unemployment has declined to 4.4%.This is why investors have rightly chosen to focus on the Fed’s change in tone on inflation. There is a growing feeling that the Fed will not raise its rates in the near future. Following the release of the policy statement, the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool declined from 52% to 50%. This means that markets now believe that the likelihood of the Fed raising rates after its December meeting has declined. Our ChoicesThe Fed’s acknowledgement that inflation has failed to rise to its targeted levels has captured the attention of market watchers. Investors now believe that such concerns will hinder the Fed’s central bank’s attempts to raise rates in the near future.This is why investing in stocks from the utilities, telecom and real estate sectors looks prudent at this time.

191,ES,"American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 financial results on Oct 26, before the market opens. Last quarter, this electric utility witnessed a negative earnings surprise of 8.54%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderAmerican Electric is highly dependent on coal for production of electricity. Therefore, President Trump’s emphasis on improving the coal industry and relaxing the stringent environmental regulations in recent times are likely to boost the company’s prospects in the near term..Also, American Electric is expected to benefit from the improving economic conditions in its service territories and its efficient cost-management initiatives.Markedly, Ohio and Texas represents more than one-half of utility revenues of the company. However, the power generation from these states is deregulated, consequently leading to the current lower price environment. This, in turn, is expected to hurt earnings of American Electric Power.Moreover, hurricane Harvey that hit the coasts of Texas at the onset of last month, hampered the smooth flow of electricity through the transmission lines leading to widespread outages in the state. As American Power’s subsidiary, AEP Texas, engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 1 million retail customers therein, we expect the company’s third-quarter bottom line to be affected severely.In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate reflected an annual decline of 3.6% on  revenues of $4.17 billion, reflecting a 10.4% decline year over year.American Electric Power Company, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise American Electric Power Company, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | American Electric Power Company, Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that American Electric will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: American Electric has an Earnings ESP of -2.39%, this is because the Most Accurate estimate is $1.22 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.25. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: American Electric carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few companies in the utility sector that have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.NiSource, Inc. (NI  -  Free Report) will report third-quarter results on Nov 1. The company has an Earnings ESP of +7.69% and a Zacks Rank #2.

The company is expected to report third-quarter results on Nov 1.Avista Corporation (AVA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +17.24% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is slated to release third-quarter results on Nov 1.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

192,ES,"CMS Energy Corporation (CMS  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 19.51%. However, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 1.60%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayCMS Energy’s regulated electric power operations in Michigan generate relatively stable earnings. However, during the second quarter, the company’s service territory was affected by storms which in turn dented earnings. The third quarter was also adversely impacted by storm activities and thus the company’s bottom line is expected to remain under pressure. In line with this, the company’s third quarter Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 62 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 12.1%.Weather conditions remain a key determinant for the company’s to-be-reported quarter. CMS Energy’s service territories have witnessed above-average temperatures during the third quarter. This will result in lower household expenditures on heating, which may adversely impact revenues.Nevertheless, the absence of discretionary activities which occurred in the second half of 2016, such as debt pre-funding and relatively high volume of donations, may benefit CMS Energy’s bottom line in the second half of 2017.Moreover, the company continues to reduce its operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, which, in turn, will facilitate capital investments. In fact, the company has been able to cut down O&M costs by more than 3% for each year of the last decade. It has cut down costs by 6.5% last year, much better than the initial expectation. We expect the company’s cost-reduction efforts to get reflected in the third quarter results as well.Earnings WhisperOur proven model does not conclusively shows that CMS Energy is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

193,ES,"DTE Energy Company (DTE  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 8.08%. Also, DTE Energy surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 11.45%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayDuring the first quarter earnings call, DTE Energy said that it expects earnings to be lower in the third quarter and reiterated its projection during the second quarter earnings call. Currently, the company is of the view that third quarter will witness sequential earnings reduction by as much as $10 million to $20 million, including base rate increases. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate pegged at $1.59 per share reflects an annual decline of 18.9%.On the brighter note, the company’s investment strategy aims at improving reliability and customer experience while maintaining affordability. In fact, the 50 megawatt (MW) Pinnebog Wind Park in Huron County, which became operational in the first quarter, is likely to contribute to the revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.Again, improved weather conditions in its Electric Utility and Gas Utility segments in the third quarter are likely to boost the company’s top line in the quarter.DTE Energy Company Price and EPS Surprise DTE Energy Company Price and EPS Surprise | DTE Energy Company QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that DTE Energy will beat estimates this quarter.
