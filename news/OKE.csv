0,OKE,"IBD's Dividend Leaders screen often unearths stocks prone to hold their ground when the market turns rough. Gas pipeline operator Oneok (OKE) is a dividend stock that fits the bill.The Tulsa, Okla.-based company projects 9% to 11% annual dividend growth through 2021. The consensus estimate sees earnings accelerating to triple-digit growth in the second quarter. And the stock is trade war-resistant, unshaken by the market's recent volatility and up 13% from an early May breakout.Oneok (pronounced one-oak) operates pipelines that gather raw natural gas directly from production areas. Its fractionation facilities divide that into natural gas (methane) and related natural gas liquids (pentane, butane, ethane). It then directs those separate products to various markets, distributors and customers via pipelines that it and other operators own.Oneok is a leading player across the Rocky Mountain region, the Oklahoma-Texas panhandle area the energy industry calls the midcontinent, and the bustling Permian Basin in west Texas. Recovering energy demand in the U.S. and overseas continues to boost demand for oil.Rising oil production leads to increasing supplies of natural gas.Oil wells produce varying levels of natural gas and natural gas liquids. Traditionally, those byproducts were ""flared off"" — vented to create a gas torch constantly burning over an oil well. Environmental regulations have begun to clamp down on the practice.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut still, Bloomberg reports that 15% of natural gas produced in North Dakota was flared off in April. That 15% limit decreases to 12% in November and 9% in 2020. At the same time, production is rising. The combination mean more gas lines are needed, and Oneok is among the leaders working to put more ""take-away"" capacity in place in the Williston and Powder River Basins, which include the Bakken and Niobrara shale fields.Oneok was also among the large group of pipeline operations that first broke off physical assets into a master limited partnership, Oneok Partners. Used as a vehicle to generate high cash flow payouts — both to the company and to investors — the industrywide scheme ran up against problems as the spun off companies maxed out their payments to their parent companies.Oneok then followed the industry's reverse trend: parents buying back their master limited partnership spinouts. Oneok announced in February last year that it had arranged a $9.3 billion stock deal to regain full ownership of Oneok Partners. The deal, completed in June, 2017, enabled Oneok to boost its dividend 21%.The downside is debt. The all-stock deal avoided ratcheting up Oneok's debt load. But the company still reported $8.52 billion in long-term debt at the end of 2017. That gave it a debt-to-equity ratio of roughly 146%. That's well within the bounds of its peers, but still meant Oneok paid interest on long-term debt of $436.1 million for the year.Oneok's annual earnings have been up and down over the past four years. Consensus views project a 62% EPS gain this year, and acceleration to 100% growth in the second quarter.The stock is extended 13% from the 61.46 buy point of a flat base. It is also well above long-term resistance around 59.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:The Big Picture: Bull Market Gets Bloody Nose; Keep Eyes On This Sell SignalPermian Oil Prices Dive As Gas Prices Rise, Boosting These RefinersWhere Can Investors Hide In A Correction?A Pipeline To Profit From The Other Energy Stocks: PlasticsOil Pipeline Company Can't Get This Key Steel Pipe Anywhere In The U.S.

3,OKE,"When are energy stocks not quite energy stocks? In the case of Oneok (OKE), it's when a sizable piece of the company's upside also owes to chemicals markets.Energy investors know that crude oil prices have been rebounding since February, ratcheting up interest in oil-related stocks.Most also know that the stocks of natural gas producers have taken a toboggan ride since early 2014. Just have a look at the charts for Range Resources (RRC), Southwestern Energy (SWN) and Chesapeake Energy (CHK).The story has been much the same for energy stocks focused on natural gas liquids — primarily ethane, propane and butane. These petroleum products are carried out of reservoirs as producers extract ""dry"" natural gas. They are also often produced from oil wells, as natural gas formed in reservoirs along with oil is released.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOne good example of an NGL stock is the relatively young Antero Resources (AR). The Marcellus and Utica Shale-based outfit became the largest U.S. producer of natural gas liquids late last year.But the story is different for natural gas and gas liquid pipelines, such as Tulsa-based Oneok. Oneok operates a 38,000-mile network of gas pipelines that gathers gas from production areas, separates out NGLs and transports the result to storage facilities, end users or larger pipelines.Its facilities cover production areas in the Williston, Permian and Rocky Mountain regions.Like most pipeline operators, Oneok charges fees for transportation and other services. The company reported that fee revenue was 86 cents per million British thermal units of gas in 2017, up from 76 cents in 2016 and 44 cents in 2015. That is a 95% fee increase. Not bad, considering that natural gas prices on Dec. 31 were only 8% higher than they were on Jan. 1, 2015.Despite those increases, Oneok has struggled. Earnings per share fell 17% in 2015, and an additional 1% last year. (EPS rose 10% in 2016.) Analysts' consensus expects a 55% rebound in EPS for 2018. A large part of that bounce is due to ethane.The shale gas revolution that started just after the turn of the century led to immense oversupply in both natural gas and NGLs. That, in turn, sent prices crashing in 2008. Gas prices remain at roughly half of the $6 to $7 per million BTU level expected by many in the industry before 2008.Fortunately, ethane is the basic starting point for a majority of plastics. And U.S. and foreign chemicals producers, lured by cheap gas, launched a vast buildup in chemical refining over the past few years. The American Chemistry Council estimates shale gas has led to 325 new U.S. petrochemical projects, totaling $194 billion in capital investment.Many of those projects are beginning to come on line. The result is more ethane demand and rising prices.Another factor: ethane exports. Overseas chemicals makers want to get their hands on cheap, shale-base ethane as well. This has driven ethane and ethylene exports from zero before 2013 to 181,000 barrels a day in 2017.When cheap, ethane is typically ""rejected"" into the dry gas stream and sold to natural gas customers. As prices make separating ethane economical, Oneok cranks up more of its fractionation capacity. For 2018, an April 4 BMO Capital markets note said the company expects to realize $100 million in incremental ethane recovery by the end of the year. Oneok targets $200 million in 2019.That is a small piece of the picture, in a company that pulled in $12.17 billion in revenue last year. But it is a large piece of the company's potential ability to top earnings projections.And it is a welcome layer of gravy, as oilfield production buzzes along at a breakneck pace in Texas and Oklahoma. Rising oil prices are also driving increased activity in areas like the Bakken shale and other Rocky Mountain production basins. As oil producers pick up the pace, they suck up oil and natural gas liquids along with the oil. Oneok provides a conduit for that byproduct.Income investors may know that Oneok was part of a midstream industry exodus away from the master limited partnership that had provided investors with dizzying dividend yields and tax advantages for more than a decade.Like many in the industry, Oneok became cash constrained due to the limitations of that model. Last year, Oneok bought out its Oneok Partner MLP. The deal was valued at just over $9 billion and created a company with an enterprise value of $30 billion.The company has notched decades of consistent dividend growth. It raised its quarterly payout in January to 77 cents, yielding 5.2% on an annualized basis.BMO Capital projects that revenue will increase 26% in 2018, then dip about 1% next year, alongside a 5% EPS gain.Debt is a caveat. Oneok put its long-term debt at around $8.1 billion at the end of last year. That was up only slightly vs. 2016, but still gives the company a big debt-to-equity balance, even relative to its heavy-debt industry segment.BMO has an outperform rating on the stock, with a 68 price target.RELATED:

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn June 2017, Oneok completed the acquisition of all the outstanding common units of Oneok Partners that Oneok did not already own.Oneok's dividend yield is 5.4%.

29,OKE,"Major stock indexes turned negative in late-afternoon trading Tuesday, not a surprise given the ebullient gains during the first two weeks of trading in 2018.X The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 both showed losses of around 0.4% to 0.5% after rising as much as 1% and 0.8%, respectively. The 500 breached 2800 for the first time. The Dow Jones industrial average eased 0.2% after rising as much as 1.1% in the early going.At one point, at least nine of the 30 components in the Dow industrials advanced 1 point or more, By around 3 p.m. ET, however, only three stocks in the Dow were up 1 point or more, and all three hailed from the health care arena: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Merck (MRK) and UnitedHealth (UNH).Merck gapped up nearly 6% to 62.07 in quadruple normal turnover on good news regarding a potential treatment involving Keytruda with two additional medicines for lung cancer. For now, Merck continues to be in base-building mode.Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was running sharply higher vs. the same time on Friday.Meanwhile, Bitcoin and other alternative digital currencies continued to cool off. Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) gave back most of Friday's rebound, losing 10% to 1,763. However, the overall picture of the fast-rising exchange-traded note has not changed. It's been in a normal correction since peaking at 3,523 on Dec. 19, and Tuesday marks the start of a fifth week of digesting the superlative gains seen in the fourth quarter of last year.On Nov. 22, Bitcoin Investment Trust broke out of a very deep cup with handle at 985.10 and roared more than 257% higher in less than a month. On a daily chart, one can see that Bitcoin Investment is trying to halt its slide at the 50-day moving average.Crude oil prices and copper eased too, while gold prices rose on the back of a weaker U.S. dollar. The euro last week moved past $1.22 for the first time since December 2015. WTI near-term futures edged 0.7% lower to $63.88 a barrel.Market breadth turned negative in U.S. equities, with losing stocks outmatching winners by nearly 2-to-1 on both exchanges.A few leading stocks let their strong gains slip. Weibo (WB) moved past a 122.31 buy point in a seven-week cup with handle and rallied to as high as 128.37, up 4.9% past the proper entry. But the stock backtracked to cut its gain to roughly 1%.The decline within Weibo's cup base runs from 123 on the left-side peak to 97.49, a correction of 20.7%. That's within the normal parameters for this important chart pattern for investors on the hunt for strong breakouts. However, the most recent base is late stage, which increases the risk of failure.The Chinese social network broke out of a first-stage base at 19.20, also a cup with handle, during the week ended April 8, 2016.Weibo was initially featured in the IBD Stock Analysis column on March 24, 2016. It also became the 10th current stock on IBD Leaderboard on Tuesday, joining fellow Chinese ADRs Autohome (ATHM) and 58.com (WUBA).Weibo wasn't alone in terms of top-rated companies starting the MLK holiday-shortened trading week on a sour note.LGI Homes (LGIH) fell more than 8% to 69.53 and triggered one sell signal as volume jumped 125% above its 50-day average. The stock posted its biggest point drop since breaking out of a solid seven-week cup base at 50.05 on Oct. 2. Tuesday's drop was also the largest since the entry-level homebuilder cleared an earlier, deeper cup base at 40.57 in late June 2017.Shares in LGI are now testing institutional buying support at the critical 50-day moving average.Lithium metal supplier Sociedad Quimica (SQM), NetEase (NTES), New Oriental Education (EDU) and streaming video hardware play Roku (ROKU) also staged negative reversals in heavy or increasing volume. Such concerted selling hinted at some pronounced profit-taking among mutual funds, hedge funds, banks, insurers, large investment advisors and the like.Stay abreast of future potential changes in the overall market trend by reading The Big Picture column each day.Amid the broad market reversal, a few highly-rated names still acted well.Oneok (OKE) gained for a fourth day in a row, rising more than 1.3% to 59.45 in above-average turnover. The oil and gas transport play has cleared a 16-week cup pattern at 56.19 and is slightly outside the proper buy range. The 5% buy zone goes up to 59.00. Buying too far extended in price puts an investor in a vulnerable spot as a stock can quickly pull back and test the initial entry following a strong move up.Wall Street expects the Oklahome-based firm to stage a strong rebound in earnings in 2018, up 34% to $2.25 a share following a 1% climb in 2017. Fourth-quarter results are likely to be announced in late February.Oneok also sports a 5.1% annualized dividend yield.Abiomed (ABMD), the heart pump maker and one of 15 names in IBD Sector Leaders screen, rose more than 1.2% to 217.74 in slightly above-average turnover. The market leader is extended after surpassing a narrow flat base at 200.38 on Jan. 5.Abiomed scores a lofty 98 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup.Grubhub (GRUB), No. 23 in the IBD 50, is off around 0.7% yet remains above the key 50-day moving average following a two-day rebound on Thursday and Friday. Continued support at the 50-day line, or 10-week moving average on a weekly chart, would give investors a chance to add to a current position in the mobile and online food ordering service.Grubhub is up 21% since clearing a 57.71 buy point in a six-week flat base on Oct. 25 following robust third-quarter results (earnings up 22% to 28 cents a share, revenue up 32% to a record $163.1 million).

45,OKE,"X The major indexes retreated to session lows in early afternoon action as energy stocks tumbled with oil prices. Meanwhile, investors digested some key quarterly results from tech giants over the past few days, with the key monthly payrolls report on tap Friday.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 slid 0.2%. The Dow Jones industrial average, up more than 2.4% over the prior two weeks, gave up 0.4%. Dow components Exxon Mobil (XOM) fell 1.3% and Chevron (CVX) 2.1% as U.S. crude futures fell 4% to $45.90 a barrel, their lowest readings since last November.The Russell 2000 sank 0.5% lower. Meanwhile, on the other side of the pond, major European bourses enjoyed solid advances; the CAC 40 jumped more than 1.3% while the Dax 100 of Germany added nearly 1%.Among other indexes, the Dow utility average edged up 0.1% after underperforming the major averages on Wednesday, losing almost 0.6%.From the birdseye view of IBD's 197 industry groups and subgroups, oil drilling led the downside with a 4.3% loss, followed by Canadian oil exploration (-4.1%), U.S. oil exploration (-4%), international oil exploration (-3.6%) and oil machinery (-3.6%).Oil and gas transport firms were not spared either, with the group getting trounced 3.4%. Oneok (OKE), a star performer in the Income Investor screen in 2016, took out its 200-day moving average in heavy volume as shares dove 5% to 49.53.The Tulsa, Okla.-based pipeline giant showed uncharacteristically wild action since a bad reversal on Feb. 1, causing the stock to spend more time below its 50-day moving average -- a key defensive sell signal. Oneok has also round-tripped its gains from a late-November breakout past a 51.82 buy point in a giant bottoming base. (Please see a long-term weekly chart at Marketsmith to fully view the deep first-stage cup with handle.) Apple (AAPL), one of the Dow Jones industrials' 30 components, continued to show a mild yet manageable decline after Wednesday's nice bounce off its intraday lows. The stock eased 0.8% to 145.90 in volume that is running above normal pace.Because the iPhone giant has now achieved a 25% gain from a Jan. 6-9 breakout from a cup-with-handle base at 118.12, an investor would be fully justified in taking the profit.However, with strong anticipation for the next iPhone series, a rising dividend, and CEO Tim Cook's intention to double service-related revenue within a few more years, an investor also has good reasons to build conviction and watch if the stock has more room to grow. But a report says iPhone sales are weakening in China.No defensive sell signals have been triggered recently.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Apple gets a solid 91 Composite Rating, a far cry from the low 60s to 70s several months back. The Composite Rating melds together IBD's most important measures of profit and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity, stock price strength, industry group strength, and other factors.The RS Rating has also vastly improved to a 90, meaning on a 12-month basis, Apple now beats 90% of all public companies in IBD's database.Snap (SNAP), meanwhile, continues to do constructive work on the right side of its base. The Snapchat operator rose 3.8% to 22.64, good for a five-week high.Watch to see if the new social media play on Wall Street can show more strength and possibly take out the 24.40 near-term high. However, that is not a proper buy point for now. Snap also has not formed a proper double bottom; the 19.73 low seen last month did not undercut the 18.90 low set on March 17.Snap's Relative Price Strength rating is irrelevant, since it lacks 12 months' worth of stock action. However, the up/down volume ratio is positive at 1.4, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup (go to the supply and demand section of this valuable timesaving tool). Keep in mind that the up/down volume ratio works best when there are at least 50 days' worth of daily price and volume action.Snap, which reports Q1 results after the close on May 10, is still 22% below its 29.44 peak.Some banks also worthy of watching include Comerica (CMA) and East West Bancorp (EWBC). But Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) continues to struggle as the stock, down 1 cent to 48.58, is still feeling selling heat near the 50-day moving average.Notice how the 50-day line, painted in red on an IBD or MarketSmith chart, has been sloping lower for at least four weeks.RELATED:More In Stock Market Today: Will These 10 Top Growth Stocks Keep Winning Big In 2017?The Big Picture: Are U.S. Equities Still Superior To Bonds Now?IBD Stock Spotlight: Why Is This Swiss Chipmaker Crushing It?The Case For A New Bull Run In GoldStrong Earnings, Hot Movers: 5 Growth Stocks To Consider

SPDR S&P 500 has seen a net $4.50 billion in outflow in June, more than any other ETF, according to global research firm XTF.com. It has leaked $8.63 billion in the second quarter and $8.02 billion over the course of 2016 so far -- again and in both cases, more than any of its peers.By comparison, Vanguard S&P 500 (VOO), which offers the same exposure to large-cap stocks, was a top asset gatherer in each of those periods.Unlike its Vanguard rival, SPDR S&P 500 is widely used for more complex investment needs such as portfolio hedging. It is the most heavily traded security in the world.""This liquidity makes it very cheap to trade in large blocks, which attracts institutional traders,"" writes Morningstar analyst Michael Rawson.Assets in SPDR S&P 500 have shrunk this year to $178.79 billion.Its top-performing stocks in Q2 included pipeline company Oneok (OKE), Southwestern Energy (SWN) and Newmont Mining Corp (NEM). Each ran up nearly 50% or more.IWM had a solid Q2, adding 3.9% as it recovered from a 1.5% decline the previous quarter. That's taken it to a 2.4% gain year to date.Despite that recovery, it continues to see net outflow. IWM leaked $1.12 billion in the past month, $1.20 billion in Q2 and $2.3 billion in the first half of 2016.Assets have dwindled to $25.45 billion since the start of the year.Its Q2 rebound was led by biomed firms Exelixis (EXEL) and Tesaro (TSRO), and e-commerce software maker Demandware (DWRE). Each of these stock holdings vaulted more than 90% over that period.Technology and biotechnology stocks floundered last month. They acted as a drag on QQQ, which has hefty weightings in the tech and health care sectors.PowerShares QQQ trails only SPDR S&P 500 in the ETF outflow stakes this year. It dribbled away $1.43 billion in June, $3.77 billion in Q2 and $6.31 billion since the start of 2016.Assets in QQQ have shrunk this year to $34.59 billion.Its woes hardly mean all its stock holdings have been duds. Top performers in the past quarter included Chinese gaming firm NetEase (NTES), and chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Micron Technology (MU). Each jumped more than 30% in that period.NetEase is a top-rated IBD Leaderboard stock.Over the first six months of 2016, the three most actively traded ETFs have seen a combined $16.61 billion in net outflow.

""If you can't get what you need, you've got to go somewhere else.""Pipeline companies are also especially dependent on imports. An ICT International study conducted for the pipeline industry found that 77% of the steel used in pipelines in recent years was imported, according to Bloomberg.Shares of Plains All American closed up 2.9% at 21.94 on the stock market today, retaking their 50-day average, amid reports that Republicans in Congress have come out in opposition to the tariffs.

If the cartel can agree on a cut, it will be its first since 2008. That sent crude prices up 8% Wednesday morning.Two years ago OPEC sank oil markets by refusing to scale back production in the face of rising U.S. output in an effort to boost market share.But shale producers proved to be resilient, lowering production costs with new technology and improved drilling techniques. Producers also shifted focus to the prolific Permian basin. Even as OPEC announced its deal, the Energy Information Administration announced that U.S. crude output hit a six-month high.Continental shares jumped 23% to 58.01 on the stock market today, jumping out of a cup with handle base and above its buy point of 54.42.Parsley climbed nearly 16% to 38.15, climbing out of a flat base and above its buy point of 37.30.IBD'S TAKE: Shale stocks are soaring as OPEC backs down from its supply glut war.

61,OKE,"Oil gushed to its best level in months in October, cracking the keenly watched, $50-per-barrel level and rewarding energy bulls who have defied weak fundamentals to pour billions into ETFs in this sector.Energy has outpaced the other S&P 500 sectors year to date through Oct. 13, jumping 18.7% while the broad market as reflected in SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) is up 6.1%.Several exchange traded funds in this sector are among the best-performing ETFs of 2016.Click Here For A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2016Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) saw $1.14 billion in net inflow over the first three quarters, helping it grow assets by 35% since the start of the year to a current $15.46 billion.The fund is a cheap and efficient way to gain exposure to the energy sector of the S&P 500. About two-thirds of its assets are in oil majors such as Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and Halliburton (HAL).Traders love its liquidity, making it a popular choice for betting on this volatile sector.Several of its peers have rewarded investors more handsomely so far this year. Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Energy (RYE) has vaulted 27.8%.It holds the same stocks as XLE but gives each an equal stake of portfolio assets. In XLE, the biggest stocks by market capitalization get a much bigger weight.So RYE benefited more from the big moves by smaller players such as Oneok (OKE), Southwestern Energy (SWN) and Spectra Energy (SE). Shares of Oneok, an oil and gas pipeline company, have more than doubled year to date on the back of strong profit growth.Some experts see a brighter outlook for oil, due to an unexpected plan among major oil-producing nations to cut production and a surprisingly big drop in U.S. stockpiles.""We see less risk of a renewed oil price plunge and the potential for a gradual rise toward long-term equilibrium levels around $60 per barrel, where supply and demand are likely to find a better balance,"" Richard Turnill, BlackRock's global chief investment strategist, wrote Oct. 10.But crude has crumbled in the past three years, and risks remain. Among them, the OPEC plan that triggered oil's latest rally is, for now, just talk.So ETF investors may want to consider tilting toward quality and low-cost producers, according to BlackRock.Quality companies boast low leverage, strong profits and consistent earnings. And low-cost companies are able to extract oil at a lower marginal cost than more expensive oil regions — certain shale plays, for example.Mega oil majors fit the quality, low-cost bill, says Tushar Yadava, an investment strategist at BlackRock. He points out that these industry giants derive revenue from multiple avenues and are less sensitive to the price of the underlying commodity. They enjoy a lower breakeven price and better profit margins.The $1.11 billion iShares Global Energy (IXC) has 40% of its assets in the world's largest producers. The fund's top five stock holdings include Exxon Mobil and Chevron, as well as France's Total (TOT) and the United Kingdom's BP (BP).The U.S. accounts for a 59% portfolio weight, the U.K. 14% and France 6%.IXC is up 19.5% year to date, outstripping XLE, but has lagged its larger peer in the longer term.Over the past 10 years, IXC produced an average annual gain of 2.1% vs. 4.6% for XLE.Despite a better outlook for oil, ETF investors should proceed with caution in the energy sector.Yadava wants to see more than improved cash flow from better commodity prices. He's looking for ""a turning point"" in earnings, revenue and estimate growth, and that is still some way off, he told IBD in an email.United States Oil (USO), a commodity ETF investing in near-month WTI futures, scored its fourth weekly advance in a row on the stock market today. It sits 25% below its November high.RELATED:Which Of The Best ETF Investment Strategies Is Right For Your Portfolio?

101,OKE,"As an income investor, can you find promising stocks for the new year by surveying what worked well in 2016? Yes, and there are several reasons why.Many of last year's strong winners have emerged from early-stage bases, so they may have further potential to rise. Also, these stocks continue to exhibit the type of steady earnings that enable future cash payouts to continue for years to come.The prospect of future hikes in the quarterly dividends among these leaders also looks promising.The biggest winners that appeared in IBD's The Income Investor column included an oil and gas pipeline play that rose 133% for the year (Oneok (OKE)), a truck maker that rolled ahead 55% (Cummins (CMI)), a paper products titan that gained 41% (International Paper (IP)), and a railroad that chugged 40% higher (CSX (CSX)).Two of these companies hailed from the transport sector, and for good reason. The Dow Jones transportation average rose nearly 21% for the year, a real sign of overall confidence in the current economy.But other top-performing income stocks hailed from a fairly wide range of industries as the stock market showed broad gains amid a choppy year.Many of the 34 companies featured in this column that rose 20% or more in 2016 saw big climbs in the third and fourth quarters, sparked in part by Donald Trump's upset win over Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election. The businessman's pledge to boost manufacturing, coal and infrastructure rebuilding inside America's borders helped unleash a strong rally in market sectors that had lagged earlier in the year.Banking stocks affirmed this fury of sudden buying, and perhaps some short-covering too, as a stream of positive economic data on jobs, industrial output, spending and personal income helped convince the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December for only the second time in 12 months.The fed funds rate rose to a target range of 0.5%-0.75%, and the prospects of three additional hikes in 2017 are currently bright.Higher interest rates — so long as they do not damage the current level of U.S. spending, building, construction and lending — bode well for the banks that rely heavily on the spread between the rates they pay for deposits and the rates they charge for loans.No wonder, then, that Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) (annualized yield of about 2%), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) (3.6% yield) and Toronto Dominion (TD) (3.3%) made the top of the winners list with year-to-date gains of 26% to 35% each.Other financial services firms also prospered. Consider Principal Financial Group (PFG), featured on Sept. 16. The insurance and retirement services firm began the year with a thud along with the market, falling more than 26% in less than five weeks to a year-to-date low of 33.09, but then mustered a steady rebound.By the end of the third quarter, the stock moved into positive ground on the back of a solid 6% gain in second-quarter earnings to $1.15 a share. That snapped a five-quarter streak of profit declines. In Q3, Principal affirmed that the profit turnaround wasn't a fluke as earnings jumped 8% despite a 13% drop in the top line.Some heavy machinery, diversified operations and other types of industrial firms also excelled. They included Johnson Controls (JCI), Ingersoll-Rand (IR) and Illinois Tool Works (ITW).Johnson's 2.4% yield is just mildly better than the S&P 500's 2.0% payout. However, shareholders apparently liked how the expert in electronic security systems, valves, pipes and fire-protection products improved its profitability. Pretax margin improved to 11.1% in fiscal 2016 (ended in September), rebounding sharply from 7.7% in fiscal 2015.Johnson's 3-year Earnings Stability Factor of 4 is excellent on a scale of zero (highly stable profits) to 99 (wild). IBD research has found that profit stability is a hallmark of a company's ability to pay or even increase its cash payouts to shareholders.Ingersoll-Rand and Illinois Tool also boast low three-year Earnings Stability Factor ratings of 2 and 4, respectively.Notice how on a weekly chart, all three of these industrial giants broke long-term downtrends in February, then went on to build and break out of what IBD calls bottoming base chart patterns.A rally out of these refreshed first-stage bases is bullish for income investors who hope to buy a stock that may be emerging out of a slump, pays a decent dividend and has the potential to deliver toasty capital gains.RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewInvesting In 2017: The Case For A Trump Era Secular Bull RunInvesting In 2017: The Presidencies Since The 1980s And Which Industry Groups Shined BrightestInvesting In 2017: The Bottoming Base, A Valuable Chart Pattern For Income Investors TooInvesting In 2017: The Bottoming Base, Part II; Why Apple Formed One In 2009Investing With Success: Learn From Gerald Loeb, A Wall Street GreatThe Income Investor: Why South Korea Fined Dividend Leader Qualcomm

102,OKE,"If you're generating steady income from a dividend stock, it doesn't matter what the company's fundamentals or technicals look like. Or does it?Many income investors may be content with a steady dividend payer even if the stock is a laggard when it comes to price performance. But stock price depreciation could erase some or all of that dividend income each quarter. To maximize your total return, it makes sense to focus on potential outperformers that offer a payout.""Without question, the most important factors income investors should look for with dividend stocks are fundamental factors,"" Robert Johnson, president and CEO of The American College of Financial Services, told IBD. ""In recent years, the price-earnings ratios on these stocks have been driven up to historically high levels ... because high-quality bonds were simply not providing the level of yields that many investors were looking for.""Click Here For A List Of Top Performing Dividend StocksSo how should one search for quality dividend stocks?

Bookmark The Income Investor column and check back for an in-depth look at a different dividend stock each day.IBD's proprietary Composite Rating is a useful tool to quickly identify quality stocks. It takes a stock's key ratings — Earnings Per Share, Relative Strength, Sales + Profit Margins + Return on Equity, Accumulation/Distribution — and combines them into a single rating on a scale from 99 (best) to 1 (worst). The rating also takes into consideration price performance by measuring how far a stock is from its 52-week high. The closer it is to the high, chances are its overall rating will be higher.Be sure to keep an eye on the overall market as well as news or other factors that could affect a stock's industry group. For instance, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates by a quarter-point at its Dec. 13-14 monetary policy meeting.""Investors should operate under the premise that rates will rise, not only in December, but for the foreseeable future,"" Johnson said. ""I would expect financial stocks — banks and insurance companies, in particular — to benefit the most from the expected increase in rates.""In fact, bank stocks have staged a strong rally since midyear as the likelihood of higher rates increased.President-elect Trump's proposals for tax cuts and increased military and infrastructure spending could affect dividend stocks too.""If he is able to push this agenda through, it would likely lead to an increase in inflation and higher inflation rates,"" Johnson said. ""As rates increase, we will likely see a rotation out of high-dividend yielding stocks and into the bond market.""The accompanying chart shows the Dividend Leaders with the biggest year-to-date price gains through Dec. 8.Topping the list is Oneok (OKE), which has surged 134% this year to nearly 58. The Tulsa, Okla.-based natural gas gatherer has a hefty 4.3% dividend yield. And its dividend growth rate is 22%. Shareholders would have soundly beaten the market twice with this stock — in terms of stock price appreciation and a big yield. Per-share earnings fell 17% last year as oil and gas transport/pipeline stocks skidded, but analysts expect a 12% EPS gain this year and 8% in 2017. Fair warning, though: This stock has been no steady eddy and must be watched. It plunged from a peak of 71.19 in September 2014 to a low of 18.24 in December 2015.That's followed by Spectra Energy (SE), another natgas gatherer and distributor, up 72% year to date to about 41. Shares are working on a flat base with a potential buy point at 44.10. The stock is 6% off its 52-week high. The Houston-based company's payout is 4% on an annual basis. Full-year profit slipped the past two years but is projected to resume growth with a 1% increase this year and 21% the next. Spectra yields 4.0% and has a dividend growth rate of 9%.Chip designer Qualcomm (QCOM), which has seen its share price rise 37% this year to 68.33, also made the list. The San Diego-based company has paid dividends each year since 2003; its current annualized yield is 3.1% and its dividend growth rate is 22%.Qualcomm has posted double-digit earnings growth the past two quarters after four quarters of year-over-year declines. That trend is expected to continue with a 22% EPS gain in the current period and 15% in fiscal Q2.Hasbro (HAS) has advanced 29% so far this year to 86.78 as it shapes the right side of a base with a potential entry at 88.63. The Pawtucket, R.I.-based toymaker offers a 2.4% dividend yield and a dividend growth rate of 10%.It has a three-year earnings growth rate of 13% and an Earnings Stability Factor of 12 on a scale of 0 (most stable) to 99 (least stable). Analysts forecast EPS will rise 18% this year and 9% the next.A few S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats — companies that have increased their dividends each year for the past 25 consecutive years — make the list too. Illinois Tool Works (ITW) and Sysco (SYY) are two such classic income plays. They have advanced 37% and 33% this year, respectively, and pay annualized dividends of 2% and 2.4%.RELATED:Flexibility Is Needed For New Era Of Income InvestingProfits From Stock Gains And Augment A Low-Yielding Portfolio

Oneok shareholders received one share of the new company for every four shares of Oneok they own. Rather than issue fractional shares, the company will pay cash.Tulsa-based Oneok has been around since 1906. One division, Oneok Partners, is a master limited partnership for gathering, processing, storing and transportation of natural gas and owns a natural gas liquids system connecting with mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain regions.Another division, Energy Services, provides premium services to customers, primarily local natural gas distribution companies. It gets the majority of its earnings from physical natural gas marketing.With low prices, natural gas is becoming an increasingly popular energy source and more of it is being produced and moved.Oneok has been a beneficiary as earnings have grown in a slow and steady manner.In 2012, earnings were $1.64 a share, compared to $1.67 the previous year.

123,OKE,"ONEOK Inc. (OKE  -  Free Report) has decided to increase its natural gas takeaway capacity in the country’s two most prolific natural gas production areas, namely the Permian Basin and Oklahoma. The new pipeline infrastructure will increase the natural gas transportation capacity by 1.7 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d).The expansion projects are all backed by multiple firm transportation commitments. Demand for the Gas Distribution services is growing across the United States due to increasing consumption of clean-burning natural gas. No doubt, increasing shale production calls for expansion and addition to the existing pipeline infrastructure.Pipeline Capacity to ExpandPer a Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration release, at present 2.21 million natural gas pipelines are in operation in the United States compared with 1.47 million miles in operation three decades ago. The natural gas pipelines are going to expand further in the near future.According to a release from PointLogic Energy, total natural gas consumption in the Lower 48 states averaged 87.4 Bcf/d during the first half of 2018, which is 8.4 Bcf/d or 11% greater than the first half of 2017. Undoubtedly, greater usage of natural gas will call for expansion of pipeline infrastructure and storage capacity.Hence, the decision of ONEOK to expand its pipeline is well timed and will allow it to reap benefits from high production volumes. These projects when completed will increase adjusted EBITDA of the company by nearly $40 million.Solid Outlook for Gas DistributionThe Gas Distribution companies enjoy the benefits of long-term contracts from the producers to transport natural gas or NGLs, which give a clear visibility of earnings. In addition, rising demand and higher production of natural gas will lead to a steady increase in the demand for pipeline services, thereby improving the prospects of pipeline operators. The increasing export of hydrocarbon gas liquids also has a positive impact on demand for gas distribution.Both the existing and new gas distribution pipelines will create a link between natural gas production areas and storage facilities with consumers and export facilities.    Price MovementIn a year’s time, ONEOK has gained 34.1%, outperforming its industry’s rally of 11.2%. Zacks Rank & Key PicksONEOK currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.96%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for the upcoming quarter.Factors to ConsiderONEOK expects to benefit from increased natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) production volume in the STACK & SCOOP areas and Williston & Permian basins along with ethane recovery in Mid-Continent.The company completed two large-scale petrochemical crackers, which are likely to boost ethane demand in the Gulf Coast and drive EBITDA, which will be reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2018 earnings per share is pegged at 63 cents. The projected figure reflects an increase of 19.23% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate moved up 5.4% in last 60 days.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that ONEOK is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

126,OKE,"Just when the key indexes ended three straight trading days in the green and market watchers thought that chances of a trade war have finally dimmed after a fearful month, the tables turned. Investors encountered new shockwaves late on Thursday when President Donald Trump announced a new set of $100 billion worth of tariffs against China. Following this announcement, market futures plummeted after the bell.Renewed fears of a trade war may find investors scurrying toward safe-haven sectors, which have already emerged as preferred investments. One of the most-popular, safe-haven sectors is utilities. This sector comprises companies that provide telephone, gas, water and electricity services. In this context, investors looking for stable dividend and interest income can invest in utilities.Tariffs on China Could Add Up to $153 BillionOn Thursday night, the President called China’s decision an “unfair retaliation,” and instructed the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to decide whether new tariffs of $100 billion should be imposed on Chinese goods. Trump added that these additional tariffs will be suitable per Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 and that the products will be selected accordingly.On Tuesday, the White House had announced new tariffs of $50 billion on more than 1,300 new Chinese products. Tariffs of 25% will be imposed on products ranging from aircraft batteries and parts to medical devices and flat-screen televisions. U.S.-China tensions started when Trump initially announced tariffs of around $3 billion on steel and aluminum imports from China in March.The reason for this war-like situation is China’s staggering $375-billion trade surplus with the United States in 2017, which the Trump administration is looking to reduce by at least $100 billion. Total U.S. tariffs on China now add up to around $153 billion. Following the United States’ tariff announcements, China also retaliated with similar moves.China Set To “Fight Back”China is clearly in no mood to sit back when the United States is gearing up to impose new tariffs on its imports. In fact, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce said that the country does not want to enter into a trade war with the United States At the same time, China is “not afraid to fight a trade war.” He added that in case the United States sticks to its “protectionist trade practices,” China will not refrain from fighting back and instead will respond with “new comprehensive measures.”Most recently, China declared that it will levy tariffs on around 106 U.S. productsincluding soybeans, aircraft, chemicals and automobiles, with a total trading value of over $50 billion. Following the announcement of Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs, China imposed tariffs of $3 billion on 128 American goods, with 15% duty levied on 120 products and 25% duty on other eight goods.China’s latest tariffs will definitely affect the U.S. economy as the exports to China were significant at $130 billion in 2017. China is the largest importer of soybeans from the United States, which was around $14 billion last year. Additionally, China’s import of aircraft equipment, oil seeds and oleaginous fruits, and motor vehicles was $16.3 billion, $12.4 billion and $10.6 billion, respectively in 2017.Buy These 5 Utility StocksWhile the recent trade war between the United States and China refuses to find any closure, investors should clearly look for defensive sectors.

136,OKE,"ONEOK, Inc. (OKE  -  Free Report) announced a 3.3% hike in its quarterly dividend to 77 cents per share from the prior quarterly dividend of 74.5 cents. The company’s new annualized equivalent dividend rate is $3.08 per share up from the prior annualized level of $2.98 per share.The new quarterly dividend will be payable on Feb 14 to shareholders of record at the close of business on Jan 29. Based on yesterday's closing price of $59.42, ONEOK’s dividend yield comes at 5.18%, better than the industry average of 2.84%.ONEOK’s Long-term GoalsWith long-term value creation in mind, the company has taken consistent steps to enhance balance sheet strength. ONEOK’s proactive approach to lower debt levels will strengthen financial health and boost performance. Notably as of Sep 30, 2017, the company further lowered debt level by nearly $1 billion.ONEOK has increased dividend by 25% since the close of the ONEOK and ONEOK Partners merger transaction in June 2017. It had announced a dividend increase to 74.5 cents per share in the first quarter following the close of the transaction, a 21% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. As previously announced, the company also anticipates growing annual dividend by approximately 9-11% through 2021.Dividend Hike Usual with UtilitiesThe demand for utility services is generally immune to fluctuations of the economic cycle especially as they provide basic services like gas, electricity, and water. Consequently, the stocks in this space are regarded as safe-havens and enjoy a steady flow of revenues and cash flows.As a result of this, these stocks tend to generate consistent profits and reward shareholders with high dividends and ONEOK is no exception. In this line, another utility, ONE Gas, Inc. (OGS  -  Free Report) has also raised quarterly dividend by 4 cents per share to 46 cents per share, effective for the first quarter of 2018, resulting in an annualized dividend of $1.84 per share. Notably, this utility has also provided investors with long-term guidance. (Read more: ONE Gas Updates Investors with Near & Long-Term Guidance)How Will ONEOK Gain?The company is currently focused on investing heavily on various projects especially in Natural Gas Liquid properties, in this case the STACK and SCOOP areas, along with Williston as well as Permian basins. It plans to draw significant volumes from these properties.These investments are expected to generate enough returns to support its 9-11% annual dividend growth target through 2021. Over the long term, the company aims to have a robust balance sheet position.Thanks to ONEOK’s initiatives to strengthen balance sheet, the company received credit rating upgrades to investment grade from both S&P and Moody's in July 2017.To summarize, we believe the company’s focus on investing in strategic integrated assets, supported by long-term goals will strengthen financial position.

137,OKE,"New Jersey Resources’ (NJR  -  Free Report) subsidiary New Jersey Natural Gas (“NJNG”) announced New Jersey Board of Public Utilities’ (“BPU”) approval to decrease its Energy-Efficiency (EE) rate. The net effect of this rate change will result in an overall annual decrease of $13.40 or 1.3% in the EE rate.The current drop in rates comes in addition to 0.7% reduction to the customers’ bill approved by the commission in September 2017. The new reduced rate is expected to come into effect from Nov 1, 2017. Notably, NJNG’s makes investment in energy-efficient equipment upgrades and whole-house improvements through The SAVEGREEN Project (SAVEGREEN).Energy Efficiency Through SAVEGREENNJNG launched The SAVEGREEN Project (SAVEGREEN) in support of its ongoing efforts to provide customers with the knowledge and money-saving incentives to make the right energy choices for families, homes, businesses and communities.Through The SAVEGREEN Project, launched in 2009, the company provides rebates up to $500 to customers for installing gas furnace, gas boiler, or a gas water heater in their homes and for other purposes. Though the program, over 49,000 customers have benefited from energy-efficiency upgrades and resulted in economic gain worth millions in New Jersey.Effect of the Rate DropAlthough weather can sometimes prove to be a headwind for the utility operators, it plays a vital role in driving demand for the utility services. A mild winter and cool summer reduces the demand for utilities. However, a normal winter and summer season assures higher demand for the same.As such a drop in the EE rates will ensure NJNG remains committed toward helping customers to lower their bills as much as possible heading into the winter season. With colder temperatures, customers are likely to increase heating activities, like installing additional heat and hot water systemsthereby driving the demand for gas.The company is able to pass on the benefits of lower costs of production to its customers through the SAVEGREEN Project. With the aforementioned rate drop, a typical residential heat customer using 1,000 therms of energy annually will see their bill decrease from $1,062.88 to 1,056.78 per year, a savings of $6.10 or 0.6%.Price MovementNew Jersey Resources’ shares have rallied 36% in the last 12 months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 17.5%.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderNew Jersey Resources carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

138,OKE,"(0:45) - Dividend Investing Strategy: What Does it Provide Investors?(3:00) - Dividend Paying Companies: High Yield vs. Dividend Growth(5:25) - QuantShares Hedged Dividend Income Fund: DIVA(9:00) - How Does DIVA Fit Into An Investor's Portfolio?(11:00) - QuantShares Market Neutral Funds(14:45) - Episode Roundup: Podcast@Zacks.comIn today’s growth-focused market, many investors have put dividend paying stocks on the backburner. Instead, the focus has largely been on the FANG group and sexy stocks in hot technology areas.However, with increased concern over the market lately, is it time to once again consider dividend securities? After all, dividends account for a sizable percentage of long-term investor returns, and getting paid to hold a stock is certainly a plus too. But how do you decide which to focus in on and which to avoid?Dividends in FocusWell, today’s podcast takes a closer look at this topic with Chuck Martin, the Portfolio Manager at AGFIQ for QuantShares. Chuck’s focus today is on the dividend market, and we discuss some of the key things that he looks for when it comes to yield-producing securities.We also take a closer look at why some investors might want to consider dividend stocks in today’s market, and what the impact of rising rates could be on this type of stock as well. Chuck and I don’t just focus on high yielding stocks though, as we also discuss the dividend aristocrat market and what investors need to know about these stocks as well.DIVA StrategyThe bulk of the discussion centers on the QuantShares Hedged Dividend Income Fund (DIVA  -  Free Report) though, as we take a closer look at this strategy. The fund looks to give investors the spread return between high and low dividend paying stocks, going long in companies that pay the highest yields, and shorting those that have unstable or limited yield prospects.This approach helps to reduce risk, and it results in a corporate bond-like risk profile for the fund. That makes it somewhat comparable to funds like LQD or VCIT, albeit with lower interest rate risk and credit risk for DIVA. It also makes this QuantShares fund a way to strip out some of the equity market volatility while still capturing yield from some of the best dividend companies in the market today.Top holdings right now focus in on energy at about 20% of the portfolio, while it accounts for a sizable short percentage too. This includes companies like ONEOK (OKE  -  Free Report) and HollyFrontier (HFC) for long exposure, though the fund is well spread out from a company specific perspective. Two other key areas for the fund right now are utilities and financials, but check out the podcast for more on the fund’s construction, and how this type of strategy can fit into a portfolio.We also take a look at two issues which should be especially important to investors in these types of funds, and those are expenses and yields. The expenses might appear extremely high here at first glance, but Chuck walks us through this aspect, while we also talk about the current yield of the fund too.  QuantSharesFinally, we also take a closer look at some of the other funds from QuantShares which are focused on a market neutral strategy. We discuss their US Market Neutral Anti-Beta Fund (BTAL  -  Free Report), which looks to provide a spread return between low and high beta stocks, while we also investigate their US Market Neutral Momentum Fund (MOM  -  Free Report) which seeks to provide a spread return between high and low momentum stocks, something that may be of particular interest in today’s market environment.But make sure to check out the podcast for more information on these funds, as well as the dividend hedged strategy, in this week’s Dutram Report!Bottom LineBut what do you think about DIVA and this hedging strategy?

141,OKE,"ONEOK Inc. (OKE  -  Free Report) announced that it is going to issue 19 million shares and expects gross proceeds from the issue, before deducting offering expenses, to be nearly $1.0355 billion. The company will allow the underwriters of the issue to purchase up to 2.85 million additional common shares to cover over-allotments, if necessary.The company has plans to utilize the net proceeds from the equity issue to fund capital expenditures — including a portion of its recently announced natural gas liquids growth projects — to pre-fund additional projects, which are in the late stages of development. It also aims to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include repaying a portion of outstanding indebtedness.Reasons Behind the IssueAt the end of third-quarter 2017, the diluted outstanding shares of the company were 383.4 million. With the fresh issue of equity, the total diluted outstanding shares will go beyond 400 million.It is a well-documented fact that utilities are capital intensive companies and are in constant need of funds.  At present, debt to capital of ONEOK is 59.46%, which is higher than the industry ratio of 47.77%. So, rising debt burden would further increase interest expenses. In addition, its current ratio is 0.55, much lower than the S&P 500 average of 1.35. Interest rates have increased four times in last five quarters, which will definitely make borrowing costlier than before.So ONEOK had to depend on the equity holders to get additional funds to carry on its capital projects and lower its debt levels.Capital Projects ONEOK, at present, has nearly $2.5-$3.5 billion of capital projects under development, which include Natural gas and NGL pipelines and development of export infrastructure. Most of the capital projects, which are underway, already have some degree of commitments from its customers.  The completed projects will be accretive to earnings and further strengthen performance of the company.Price MovementShares of the company have returned 6.8% in the last six months compared with the Zacks Gas Distribution industry’s rally of 1.4%.ONEOK has already completed projects worth $9 billion between 2006 and 2016 in highly productive regions, which is driving the performance of the company.Zacks Rank & Key PicksONEOK currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

147,OKE,"Sempra Energy (SRE  -  Free Report) announced that its Mexican subsidiary — Infraestructura Energética Nova, S.A.B. de C.V. (IEnova) — has secured a $150 million contract for liquid fuels project from the Topolobampo Port Administration in Mexico. Per the terms of the agreement, IEnova will construct and operate a marine liquid fuels terminalin Sinaloa.Notably, this latest project will operate as a receipt, storage and send-out terminal.About the ProjectPer the deal, IEnova will conduct the entire development process of this terminal that includes obtaining customer contracts and permits, engineering, procurement and construction as well as providing financing services. It will also supervise the work related to operations and maintenance.On completion, the first phase of the Topolobampo terminal will have a capacity to store 1 million barrels of gasoline and diesel. IEnova expects to commence operations at the terminal in the fourth quarter of 2020.Details of future phases of the project are not yet been disclosed but may have provisions for additional fuel storage capacity and storage of petrochemicals.Our ViewPer a report published by the International Energy Agency, Mexico’s total energy demand is expected to increase by approximately 20% by 2040 from 2016’s level, with increasing dominance of liquid fuels in power generations. This surely reflects solid growth prospects of the energy sector in Mexico, with liquid fuels at its center. This has set the stage for energy services providers like Sempra Energy to expand its footprints in Mexico by constructing new liquid fuels projects like the latest one.Impressively, with Mexico opening up its energy sector to private investment in 2014, IEnova has invested more than $7.7 billion in assets and ranks among the largest energy companies in the country. In liquid fuels market, which has a value of $10 billion, the company is increasingly engaging in construction of fuel terminals.For instance, in April 2018, IEnova announced that it will construct a marine liquid fuels terminal worth $130 million at the La Jovita Energy Hub in Ensenada. In sync with this, the latest Topolobampo project marks further expansion of business operations for IEnova in Mexico, where the company already enjoys a solid presence.Such project constructions and their subsequent operationsshould increase Sempra Energy’s shares in the Mexico’s energy market, which the company believes to have a value of $45 billion.Price PerformanceIn a year’s time, Sempra Energy has underperformed the industry it belongs to. Shares of the company have gained 4.4% compared with the industry’s 12.6% rise. This underperformance may have been caused due to stiff competition that Sempra Energy faces across the United States as well as its exposure to foreign currency risks.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderSempra Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Atmos Energy Coporation (ATO  -  Free Report), ONEOK, Inc.

148,OKE,"The ongoing trade conflict between United States and China is showing no signs of abating. The issue has escalated to a point where imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs may go up to $550 billion on either side. From Jul 6, the first phase of these tariffs with a total worth of $34 billion will be implemented.Since March 2018, U.S. stock markets have been facing severe volatility primarily due to imposition of various tariffs by the U.S. government and related trade conflict. The situation is likely to aggravate in the near-term as the U.S. deadline to impose first phase of tariffs on China ends today. At this stage, it will be prudent to invest in defensive stocks to keep one’s portfolio safe from day-to-day market fluctuations.  The US-China Trade War IntensifiesOn March 2018, the United States had decided to levy 25% tariffs worth of $50 billion on China. Nearly 1,300 Chinese products which are utilized in high-tech sectors like industrial robots, information technology, communication technology, aerospace and medicine bore the brunt of the tariffs.The rest of tariffs worth $16 billion will be implemented within next two weeks. China has also retaliated by imposing tariffs worth of $50 billion primarily on U.S. agricultural exports. Meanwhile, two rounds of meetings between high-level delegations of both governments took place in May. However, no proper resolution was reached.Notably, on Jul 5, President Trump stated that his administration would consider imposing additional tariffs worth $500 billion on Chinese goods, should Beijing retaliate. Additionally, the U.S. government barred Chinese telecom behemoth China Mobile to enter the U.S. market.Tariffs Imposed on Other CountriesSine Jun 1, the U.S. government has imposed 25% tariff on steel and 10% on aluminum from the imports of Canada, Mexico and the European Union (EU). President Trump levied these tariffs on March 1 for the first time. Notably, these countries have been close political allies of the U.S. government for a long time.As a result of these trade conflicts, U.S. exports have become vulnerable to retaliatory tariffs.  Almost all countries of the EU along with Canada and Mexico have either retaliated or have decided to retaliate against the United States.Our Top PicksStock markets are likely to remain volatile in near future due to trade concerns, geopolitical conflicts and may be some sector specific issues. At this stage, investment in defensive sectors such as utilities and consumer staples will be fruitful.We have narrowed down our search on five stocks with Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and strong growth potential.

If the Trump administration's proposed 25% tariff on imported steel were not enough, now midstream network providers have found themselves entangled in an FERC tax ruling, bleeding them even further.The benchmark Alerian MLP Index – tracking 40 partnerships – suffered its worst fall in more than two years on Thursday in a sell-off sparked by concerns of lower tariffs and cash flows. While selling hit most sector constituents, Plains All American Pipeline L.P. (PAA  -  Free Report) and Energy Transfer Partners L.P. (ETP  -  Free Report) were two of the biggest daily percentage decliners.The Business of MLPs & Advantages of The StructureMLPs differ from regular stocks in that interests in them are referred to as units and the unitholders (not shareholders) are partners in the business. Importantly, these hybrid entities bring together the tax benefits of a limited partnership with the liquidity of publicly traded securities. The assets that these partnerships own typically – oil and natural gas pipelines and storage facilities.MLPs represent an attractive investment option for income-focused investors in the current environment. In addition to high yields, MLPs are structured as pass-through entities.This means that they typically distribute nearly all of their cash flows back to unitholders. The MLPs are not required to pay a corporate income tax as the tax liability of the entity is passed on to its owners (or unitholders) in the form of a cash dividend (distribution). This allows the MLPs to offer very attractive yields to the investors.The FERC Tax RulingOn Mar 15, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (‘FERC’) ruled that the interstate oil and natural gas pipelines owned by MLPs can no longer avail a credit for income taxes they do not pay. Revising its 2005 Policy Statement for Recovery of Income Tax Costs, the federal regulators found that the longstanding income tax allowance in their cost-of-service fees could lead to double recovery of costs for the asset class who are pass-through entities not subject to corporate income taxes.The Net Effect of the Policy RevisionLooking ahead, the FERC policy revision signals significant future changes on how the pipeline partnerships will go about treating income taxes in their books of accounts.As mentioned above, MLPs, being pass-through entities, allocates their pre-tax income to unitholders on a proportionate basis. The unitholders are then responsible for paying their own share of the partnership's tax obligation. Therefore, the FERC felt that its 2005 policy on income tax allowance provided the partnerships an unfair benefit, possibly resulting in double recovery of costs and boosting their distributable cash flows.FERC’s recent tax policy change is aimed at addressing this issue. The regulatory body is expected to issue a formal rulemaking guide, outlining the impact of the removal of income tax allowance on interstate pipeline rates.Consequently, partnerships charging cost-based rates for interstate transportation service would have to lower customer tariffs to move oil, gas and refined products around the country by the amount of their income tax allowances - substantial in certain cases. A reduction in cost recovery would likely cut into their cash flows.Impact on MLPSWhile the FERC ruling is definitely a negative for MLPs, it must be remembered that the move will not affect all partnerships and assets. In particular, the changes are not likely to impact pipeline companies that are structured as ‘C-Corporations’ (and not as MLPs) like Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report) and ONEOK, Inc. (OKE  -  Free Report). The federal revision will also not apply to MLPs owning midstream assets that begin and terminate within the same state.On the other hand, MLPs with significant ‘cost-of-service’ exposure and large amounts of interstate pipelines – including Energy Transfer Partners and Spectra Energy Partners (SEP  -  Free Report) – look to be in most trouble. The change in income tax policies will result in rate reduction, and therefore lower cash flow for pipelines owned by these MLPs.That said, all midstream operators with interstate pipelines will not be equally affected by the FERC ruling on tax allowances, with the impact essentially depending on how they charge rates. For example, pipelines under cost-of-service rates will be impacted but those subject to market-based or negotiated tariffs won’t be materially affected.What NextThough a number of MLPs came out with press releases claiming negligible or no material impact from the FERC ruling, the tax policy change has gripped the sector with wide-ranging concerns and uncertainty. With the new rule expected to be adopted only by 2020, the issue may remain a thorn in the flesh for the foreseeable future.Opportunity for Bottom FishingThe speed of Thursday’s jaw-dropping sell-off send MLP investors in a panic. Most of them are still jittery and are waiting for the dust to settle before coming back to the market. In particular, they will be carefully analyzing the partnerships’ press releases related to FERC’s ruling wherein the companies gradually come out with disclosures associated with cost of service exposure and potential impact to their cash flows.However, most analysts saw the broad selling as an overreaction with enough opportunity to wade back in the industry. If you are a savvy investor — meaning you see a buying opportunity when stocks sell off — then it may be time to look at MLPs. One might opt for fundamentally strong names that are not likely to be impacted from the FERC rule change but got unfairly punished when the sector as a whole took a turn lower.We have shortlisted two of them – Calumet Specialty Products Partners, L.P. (CLMT  -  Free Report) and Oasis Midstream Partners L.P. (OMP  -  Free Report) – carrying Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Calumet Specialty Products Partners is a major North American producer of high-quality, specialty products and fuels. The Indianapolis, IN-based partnership makes a significant portion of its money by processing crude oil into lubricating oils, solvents, waxes, and other petroleum products. These activities would experience no impact from the FERC change.Oasis Midstream Partners is primarily focused on production gathering and gas processing. The Houston, TX-based partnership’s tariffs come from its economic interests in gathering pipelines, processing facilities and storage facilities, which will see no material effect from FERC's policy revision.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!

156,OKE,"Investors in ONEOK, Inc. (OKE  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jun 1, 2018 $56.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for ONEOK shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, ONEOK is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Utility - Gas Distribution industry that ranks in the Top 19% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, four analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one has dropped the estimate. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 63 cents per share to 66 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about ONEOK right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

157,OKE,"As per North Dakota’s oil regulator, the state’s daily crude output fell 1.1% in March after edging down 0.4% in the previous month. The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources’ (‘DMR’) latest data said that oil production in March averaged 1,162,071 barrels a day, down 13,245 barrels a day from February.But unlike crude, natural gas output went up – from February’s 2,106,121 thousand cubic feet per day to 2,116,294 thousand cubic feet per day – a new all-time high. As operators scramble to the core areas of the Bakken, wells here tend to produce more gas along with crude (present gas flare rate of around 12%).Record Number of Producing WellsMeanwhile, North Dakota’s total number of producing wells numbered 14,457 at the end of March, the highest on record.While the slight drop in oil activity – primarily attributed to windy weather – is the fourth month-over-month production decrease in a row, daily output remained above 1 million barrels for the fourteenth month.Therefore, notwithstanding the temporary blip, the newest numbers confirm the resurgence in volumes extracted from North Dakota, centered on the Bakken Shale formation.Rig Count ImprovesSome 59 drilling rigs were active in the state in March, up two from the February average. The drilling rig count increased further to 60 in April. The all-time low of 27 was set in May 2016, while a year ago, North Dakota had just 46 rigs operating.A closely watched yardstick of North Dakota oil industry's strength, the improvement in the number of units searching for oil and gas in the region indicates rebounding drilling activities and production. Going by the outlook of crude producers, seven to ten more rigs are likely to join the fleet by the end of this year. Though the current rig count is still down considerably from the peak of May 2012 when North Dakota had 218 units drilling, one must note that sophisticated drilling rigs have enabled producers to get more oil out of each well. In other words, modern rigs have helped boost the per-unit output.Shale Industry Adjusts to the New RealityMore rigs in operation and stable production not only confirms the positive developments for the state of North Dakota, but also points to the rising flood of U.S. shale-driven production.Now at a financial equilibrium, the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work. Throughout the downturn, producers (in North Dakota and particularly the Permian Basin in Texas) worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock. And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques.With these efforts, many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new $50-$60 oil reality and even thrive at those prices. In other words, while OPEC's moves to trim output and rebalance the demand-supply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent, in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more.Crude Prices on a Steady Climb UpwardThe U.S. West Texas Intermediate benchmark hit a three-and-half-year high of $72.24 recently. Also, we are confident that improving fundamentals have probably put a floor under crude prices for the time being. While we do not rule out chances for short-term pullbacks on surging domestic production and a stronger U.S. dollar, we remain extremely confident of an extended period of gains in the near future.In this context, the steady recovery in North Dakota’s production bode well for the region. With oil prices likely to head higher, the monthly output in the second-largest oil producing state after Texas is expected to stay above the psychologically important one million barrel a day mark for the time being.Dakota Access Pipeline Increased Takeaway CapacityApart from the strength in crude prices, there is another factor that is set speed up Bakken output growth – the 1,100-mile-long Dakota Access Pipeline.Making good on his campaign promises to rev up infrastructure spending, President Trump ignored bitter opposition from environmental activists and signed executive order to smooth the way for Energy Transfer Partners’ (ETP  -  Free Report) $3.7 billion Dakota Access Pipeline just a few days into his new Administration.As a result, disregarding the censure from environmental groups and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the sponsor – carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) – brought the controversial conduit online in early June 2017. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.With the project’s arrival, operators have scrambled to use the Dakota Access Pipeline to send a major portion of their product to market. In fact, around 73% of oil shipments out of North Dakota are now being carried by pipelines, with the costly railroad share dropping from over 24% in the early part of 2017 to some 17%.Market players believe that the pipeline has helped in bettering the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators. Set to carry about 520,000 barrels of oil daily, or more than 50% of North Dakota’s output, the commencement of the Dakota Access Pipeline has bridged the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U.S. oil producing areas like the Permian Basin.The geographically constrained Bakken Shale's crude has now better access to Gulf and East Coast refineries and also reaches international markets. As expected, the pipeline, where energy majors like Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report), Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) have invested, has helped to improve the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators and benefit the state financially.Products from companies like Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report),  and Hess Corp. (HES  -  Free Report) were among the first to reach the international markets (China and Netherlands), with the help of Dakota Access.While there are apprehensions that growing North Dakota production could outpace the pipeline capacity again sometime next year leading to widening discount for the regional crude, current prices continue to exceed breakeven costs by around $30 per barrel.But there is definitely a case to build more infrastructure for the ever-increasing natural gas volumes. Recently, North Dakota Public Service Commission green lighted Tulsa-based ONEOK Inc.’s (OKE  -  Free Report) suspended Demicks Lake processing plant. The 200 million-cubic-feet-per-day facility, costing around $400 million, is likely to be completed by the fourth quarter of next year. The conduit will enhance processing capacity in North Dakota's Williston Basin, where wells churn out the maximum gas.Oil Production Expected to Hit Record in 2018     Overall, rebounding oil prices, together with the start of the Dakota Access Pipeline, are expected to support further increase in Bakken output by providing the companies a chance to push their produce outward at a lower cost.In fact, Lynn Helms – the director of DMR – feels that a conducive oil pricing environment is likely push the state’s output beyond the all-time high of 1,227,483 barrels/day sometime by mid-2018.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

158,OKE,"ONEOK Inc. (OKE  -  Free Report) has gained 4.2% in the last year as against the industry’s decline of 0.6%. ONEOK stands to benefit from higher fee-based earnings and midstream assets located in higher productive regions.  ONEOK has a network of nearly 38,000 miles of natural gas liquids and pipelines that are strategically located in highly productive regions, thanks to $9 billion of its completed growth projects between 2006 and 2016. Another $3.6-billion new natural gas liquids growth project was announced in June 2017. All these projects are expected to come online by the first half of 2020 and further boost revenues of the company.In 2017, ONEOK’s consolidated earnings were 90% fee based. In 2018, the company expects the same to be on par with the prior year. The company anticipates to benefit from increase in natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) production volume in the STACK and SCOOP areas, and Williston and Permian basins, and increased ethane recovery in the Mid-Continent, throughout 2018.ONEOK is poised to benefit from the Sterling III Pipeline expansion, West Texas LPG Pipeline expansion and Canadian Valley natural gas processing facility expansion announced in June 2017.
