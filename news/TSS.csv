The stock has triggered the 7%-8% sell rule after a breakout past a 50.62 buy point failed.Brighthouse Financial (BHF) continued a steep decline, dropping to its lowest price level since September.

31,TSS,"Fidelity National Information Services (FIS)and PayPal Holdings (PYPL) could figure in as buyers during the next round of mergers in the payment processing industry, says one analyst.XStifel analyst John Davis says Fidelity could acquire Total System Services (TSS) while PayPal looms as a buyer of Netherlands-based Adyen, though other companies could jump in.""We believe a bidding war could break out for private European e-commerce merchant acquirer Adyen next year,"" said Davis in a report. ""While we expect PayPal to be the ultimate acquirer given its significant funding advantage, we wouldn't completely count out Global Payments (GPN) or someone out of left field (like Google-owned Alphabet (GOOGL) or Amazon.com (AMZN)).""Vantiv on July 5 agreed to buy British payment processing company Worldpay Group in a stock-and-cash deal worth about $10 billion. That deal has sparked more merger speculation. French payments specialist Ingenico last week agreed to buy Stockholm-based rival Bambora from Nordic Capital for $1.5 billion.""We think the deal that makes the most sense would be (Fidelity) acquiring Total System Services given the significant potential accretion coupled with the undeniable strategic and cultural fit,"" said Davis in the report. ""We believe strategically it is a home run as it would give (Fidelity) significant scale in issuer credit processing as well as afford the company entrance into the faster growing, higher multiple merchant acquiring business.""IBD'S TAKE: PayPal stock is up 48% in 2017 and is extended following the run-up. Global Payments, Total System Services and Square all have a Composite Rating, a CAN SLIM investing metric, in the high 90s out of a possible 99. Learn more bout the group at IBD Stock Checkup.Since it was spun off from eBay (EBAY) in 2015, PayPal has evolved from a payment button to a broad payments service provider, while expanding from online checkout to mobile payments.Loop Capital recently speculated that PayPal could target Square (SQ). San Francisco-based Square makes credit-card readers that plug into mobile phones and tablets. While Square's primary customers are small businesses, it's attracting bigger customers, analysts say.Fidelity stock ticked up 0.1% to close at 90.12 on the stock market today. PayPal stock was down 0.2% to finish at 58.58. Shares in Square dipped 0.4% to 26.75.

(FDC) In a note to clients, Josh Beck, a KeyBanc analyst, said the sector is outdistancing most others.""Our 'Rebound Year' thesis has played out thus far with the payments group outperforming the S&P 500 by 1700 basis points year-to-date,"" Beck said. He went on to say: ""Our key ideas are Vantive, Total System Services, and PayPal, where improving fundamentals, debate narratives, and (merger) synergies could drive outperformance.""KeyBanc raised PayPal's price target to 64 from 60, Square's target to 28 from 22, and Vantive's to 73 from 70. Beck hiked Visa's price target to 105 from 100, Total System Services' target to 68 from 64, Mastercard's to 135 from 130, and First Data's to 20 from 18.PayPal has shifted its strategy to give consumers more payment options at checkout, such as using credit cards. PayPal in 2016 announced online check-out deals with credit card firms Visa and Mastercard. PayPal had used mainly banking partners to process payments.""Consumer choice expands the pie and could be an underappreciated international tailwind,"" Beck said.Vantiv on July 5 agreed to buy British payment processing company Worldpay Group in a stock-and-cash deal worth about $10 billion.IBD'S TAKE: Which companies are hitting 52-week highs?

Barclays also raised its price target on Square to 17 from 15 on Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix and Broadcom, and nontechs such as Nucor, Burlington Stores and Martin Marietta, are among stocks on IBD's Leaderboard. Leaderboard follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping.""The SMB software market is the most fragmented with Vantive (VNTV), Total System Services (TSS) and Global Payments (GPN) as the leaders; First Data (FDC) is a relatively new entrant. The national category is dominated by the likes of NCR and Micros. Square's predominant segment, micro-merchant, is relatively underserved, in our view, which creates opportunity for SQ to compete.""Square went public at $9 per share in November 2015, but within three months it was trading just above 8, its all-time low. The payments field has become crowded, but Square has been striving to carve out its niche.""Net-net, we see the opportunity for $5 million to $50 million of a high-margin revenue opportunity,"" Beck said in the report.

The new midpoint is above consensus views for $2.94, largely due to Q3's better-than-expected result.Third-quarter EPS rose 17% to 70 cents, topping expectations for 67 cents. Adjusted net revenue increased 6% to $497 million, above views for $493 million.

But there was some sense on the Street that Global Payments had paid too much.In its statement Wednesday, Global Payments' Chief Executive Officer Jeff Sloan said, ""We are delighted with the progress we have made on the partnership with Heartland Payment Systems and look forward to closing the transaction later this month.""As more people do business over phones or tablets, and e-commerce becomes the norm, the payments industry has tried to broaden its reach and become more digitally focused, often through acquisitions.

74,TSS,"Mike Brown uses a baseball analogy when talking about Euronet Worldwide, the provider of electronic payment services where he serves as chief executive.
"
75,TSS,"Specifically, Brown compares Euronet (EEFT) to the newly crowned World Series champion Kansas City Royals, who reside just down the road from the company's Leawood, Kan., headquarters.
"
76,TSS,"Kansas City beat the New York Mets in the series by playing ""small ball"" — baseball jargon for scoring runs with singles and smart base-running rather than power hitting. The Royals hit only two home runs during the series — New York had six — but Kansas City ran away with the championship, four games to one.
"
77,TSS,"Euronet is like that, Brown says. The company isn't that big or heavily traded.
"
78,TSS,"But it racks up consistent financial growth and has rewarded investors with an upwardly mobile stock price.
"
79,TSS,"""We are not a flash in the pan,"" Brown said in an email interview with Investor's Business Daily. ""Our colleagues are hardworking, modest and creative. We're just like the K.C. Royals — not many home runs, but lots and lots of singles; moving runners around the bases for the win.""
"
80,TSS,"He points to Euronet's recent per-share earnings growth — 30% in 2013, 27% last year and an expected 28% this year.
"
81,TSS,"Thriving In Rough Times
"
82,TSS,"Brown sounds particularly proud of the company's ability to grow even during rough patches in the economy.
"
83,TSS,"""During the recession, we never went backwards,"" Brown said.
"
84,TSS,"Euronet management doesn't even worry much about the macro headwinds that keep other executives up at night. ""We have such huge opportunities, our worries are more about execution,"" he said.
"
85,TSS,"Those opportunities stretch across all three of Euronet's business segments: electronic funds transfer — or EFT — processing, e-pay and money transfer.
"
86,TSS,"The EFT processing segment provides electronic payment services, from ATM withdrawals to point-of-sale, or POS, products.
"
87,TSS,"The e-pay segment offers electronic distribution and processing of prepaid mobile airtime and other electronic payment products, as well as gift card distribution and processing services. This segment operates a network of around 681,000 POS terminals.
"
88,TSS,"The money transfer segment provides a host of products and services, including consumer-to-consumer and account-to-account money transfers, prepaid cards, customer bill payment services, check-cashing services and foreign-currency exchange services.
"
89,TSS,"Walmart-2-Walmart
"
90,TSS,"One of the money transfer segment's biggest wins came last year, when Wal-Mart (WMT) selected Euronet subsidiary Ria Financial Services to operate its store-to-store money transfer service. The service is called, fittingly enough, ""Walmart-2-Walmart.""
"
91,TSS,"It lets shoppers transfer money to and from thousands of Wal-Mart stores nationwide at a big discount compared to competing money transfer services.
"
92,TSS,"""Walmart-2-Walmart has set a new price point and superior service level that totally disrupted the domestic money transfer model and accrued profits to us while pumping hundreds of millions of dollars back into consumers' pockets,"" Brown said.
"
93,TSS,"In the third quarter, Euronet's EFT, e-pay and money transfer segments had constant-currency operating profit growth of 39%, 38% and 110%, respectively, he said.
"
94,TSS,"Foreign Resources
"
95,TSS,"Nearly three-quarters of the company's revenue comes from outside the U.S., though the U.S. is its biggest single market, followed by Germany. Euronet is rapidly expanding its footprint both here and overseas.
"

102,TSS,"ATM Expansion
"
103,TSS,"In a research report, William Blair analyst Christopher Shutler called the third-quarter results ""excellent,"" driven by the ETF and money transfer segments, as well as a rapid expansion of Euronet's ATM network.
"
104,TSS,"""Euronet has added almost 1,700 ATMs in the first nine months of the year,"" Shutler noted. ""Pacing of ATM additions is ahead of management's goal of adding 2,000 ATMs this year.""
"
105,TSS,"Roughly two-thirds of the ATMs are expected to be added in Europe.
"
106,TSS,"""Looking ahead, key EFT growth drivers should include the continued addition of more ATMs and value-added services, as well as growing contributions from prepaid debit cards and point-of-sale DCC (dynamic currency conversion) transactions,"" Shutler predicted.
"
107,TSS,"DCC transactions let card holders convert transaction costs to their home currencies.
"
108,TSS,"Euronet's third-quarter results came after the close on Oct. 21. The next day, its stock price popped 7.9% — its biggest single-session gain since February.
"
109,TSS,"Shares hit a high of 82.14 Nov. 6.
"
110,TSS,"Euronet's rivals include Western Union (WU) and MoneyGram International (MGI), as well as privately held Pulse Network.
"
111,TSS,"While Western Union and MoneyGram have struggled to establish consistent financial growth in the last several quarters, Euronet has been a stellar performer.
"
112,TSS,"It boasts an excellent IBD Composite Rating of 97, putting it near the top of IBD's Finance-Credit Card group.
"
113,TSS,"Other group leaders include Visa (V), Alliance Data Systems (ADS), MasterCard (MA) and Total System Services (TSS).Mike Brown uses a baseball analogy when talking about Euronet Worldwide, the provider of electronic payment services where he serves as chief executive.Specifically, Brown compares Euronet (EEFT) to the newly crowned World Series champion Kansas City Royals, who reside just down the road from the company's Leawood, Kan., headquarters.Kansas City beat the New York Mets in the series by playing ""small ball"" — baseball jargon for scoring runs with singles and smart base-running rather than power hitting. The Royals hit only two home runs during the series — New York had six — but Kansas City ran away with the championship, four games to one.Euronet is like that, Brown says. The company isn't that big or heavily traded.But it racks up consistent financial growth and has rewarded investors with an upwardly mobile stock price.""We are not a flash in the pan,"" Brown said in an email interview with Investor's Business Daily. ""Our colleagues are hardworking, modest and creative. We're just like the K.C. Royals — not many home runs, but lots and lots of singles; moving runners around the bases for the win.""He points to Euronet's recent per-share earnings growth — 30% in 2013, 27% last year and an expected 28% this year.Thriving In Rough TimesBrown sounds particularly proud of the company's ability to grow even during rough patches in the economy.""During the recession, we never went backwards,"" Brown said.Euronet management doesn't even worry much about the macro headwinds that keep other executives up at night. ""We have such huge opportunities, our worries are more about execution,"" he said.Those opportunities stretch across all three of Euronet's business segments: electronic funds transfer — or EFT — processing, e-pay and money transfer.The EFT processing segment provides electronic payment services, from ATM withdrawals to point-of-sale, or POS, products.The e-pay segment offers electronic distribution and processing of prepaid mobile airtime and other electronic payment products, as well as gift card distribution and processing services. This segment operates a network of around 681,000 POS terminals.The money transfer segment provides a host of products and services, including consumer-to-consumer and account-to-account money transfers, prepaid cards, customer bill payment services, check-cashing services and foreign-currency exchange services.Walmart-2-WalmartOne of the money transfer segment's biggest wins came last year, when Wal-Mart (WMT) selected Euronet subsidiary Ria Financial Services to operate its store-to-store money transfer service. The service is called, fittingly enough, ""Walmart-2-Walmart.""It lets shoppers transfer money to and from thousands of Wal-Mart stores nationwide at a big discount compared to competing money transfer services.""Walmart-2-Walmart has set a new price point and superior service level that totally disrupted the domestic money transfer model and accrued profits to us while pumping hundreds of millions of dollars back into consumers' pockets,"" Brown said.In the third quarter, Euronet's EFT, e-pay and money transfer segments had constant-currency operating profit growth of 39%, 38% and 110%, respectively, he said.Foreign ResourcesNearly three-quarters of the company's revenue comes from outside the U.S., though the U.S. is its biggest single market, followed by Germany. Euronet is rapidly expanding its footprint both here and overseas.""We continue to expand geographically in all three of our segments,"" Brown said. ""Just in the last year, we added four to five new countries for EFT, tens of thousands of locations for money transfer, and hundreds of new products across new countries in e-pay.""Financially, Euronet has been on a nice roll, with 11 straight quarters of double-digit EPS growth.The company logged third-quarter earnings of $1.04 a share, up 30% from the prior year, beating consensus views.Sales grew 6% to $481.4 million.It was the second straight quarter of single-digit revenue growth following four quarters of double-digit gains.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect double-digit growth to return in the fourth quarter, with revenue rising 10% to $506.1 million.

128,TSS,"What a difference a week makes. Not long ago, scores of stocks saw their breakouts fizzle, if not trigger sell signals, amid the recent market downturn. Now, with the market back in a confirmed uptrend, many leaders have recovered and broken out to new highs or are setting up for potential breakouts.In fact, a few IBD 50 stocks such as Epam Systems (EPAM), Global Payments (GPN) and Universal Insurance (UVE) are already well out of reach from their buy points.Some other leaders are still within the 5% buy zone from their recent breakouts.Bank of the Ozarks (OZRK) cleared a 45.25 cup-with-handle buy point Tuesday. Note that volume was only 15% above average, short of the 40% minimum threshold that's ideal at a breakout. The base was also late stage, which carries higher risk than early-stage patterns. Ozarks reports Q3 earnings Tuesday after the close.On Thursday, Starbucks (SBUX) recrossed a 59.06 buy point that it initially climbed past Monday. It remains 1% above the entry. Turnover was below average both days. An up-down volume ratio above the neutral 1.0 level, however, indicates demand for shares.Total System Services (TSS) on Friday cleared an early 48.18 buy point of a cup with handle in average trade. The conventional entry is just ahead at 48.77. The stock has advanced in eight of the past nine sessions. Its relative strength line is in new high ground, a bullish sign.The Georgia-based company leads the credit card and payment processing group with a 99 Composite Rating. The group also includes Global Payments and Blackhawk Network (HAWK).Blackhawk rose past a 46.23 entry intraday Friday before closing slightly below the entry. Excluding the Aug. 24 flash crash, the correction in the base was 18%, normal for a proper pattern. The provider of gift cards and payment service reports Q3 results Tuesday after the close.Other IBD 50 stocks nearing their buy points and setting up potential breakouts across a broad range of sectors include Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), which is 3% below a 758.71 flat-base buy point.O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) is close to a 258.25 entry, also from a flat base, and Paycom Software (PAYC) is slightly below a 41.68 buy point.All the stocks in this column were in the Oct. 5 issue.

169,TSS,"As a result, it's been able to grow revenue at a 40%-plus rate for the past nine consecutive quarters. Earnings per share increased 15% to 26% during the past six quarters. Its stock is up 36% so far this year.
"
170,TSS,"The transition to chip cards, or what the industry calls EMV migration, has challenged the industry. October is the target for the so-called ""liability shift."" After the shift, when a transaction takes place, the party with the weaker technology will bear the cost of the possible hack or fraud.
"
171,TSS,"That's why most national merchants, retailers and banks have been working hard to issue the EMV cards and install EMV card terminals. Those cards carry a chip and are accessible with a PIN instead of the classic magnetic cards that require a signature. The technology embedded in the chip is much more complex; it makes point-of-sale transactions a lot more secure and the cards nearly impossible to duplicate. The chip cards alone do not enhance online payment security, though.
"
172,TSS,"This system has already been in use for many years in Europe and elsewhere in the world. EMV stands for Europay, Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V), the originators of the standard. The U.S. is the last payment market to migrate to it, mostly due to the vastness of the old tech and the cost and complexity of the transition.
"
173,TSS,"The result is that more credit card fraud migrated to the less secure U.S. market over the years. Now that chip cards will enhance the security on that end, the risk may shift to the weaker links in the industry: small and medium-size businesses and online users.
"
174,TSS,"That's where Vantiv comes in.
"
175,TSS,"In addition to being a leader in the EMV transition, Vantiv also has taken steps beyond it. ""We think that the best way for the merchants to protect information is to do what we call a security suite of products, which is accepting EMV cards but also encrypting the information and tokenization,"" said Vantiv CEO Charles Drucker.
"
176,TSS,"Point-to-point encryption helps merchants protect client data. ""If the data is encrypted from the point they swipe the card to the point that it's received by us as payment processor ... that data is now protected and virtually impossible to unencrypt, and that's a value-added service we make revenue on,"" said Andrew Ciafardini, vice president of corporate communications for Vantiv.
"
177,TSS,"The other tool is tokenization, which removes the credit card number completely from the retailer's system. Instead, the retailer gets a representation of the number, which is called a token and is specific to that retailer, Ciafardini explained. ""So even if the system were breached, a criminal could not use that token anywhere else.""
"
178,TSS,"Growth By Acquisiton
"
179,TSS,"Vantiv has made three acquisitions in recent years. At the end of 2012, it acquired Litle, an independent e-commerce payment processor for Internet and direct-response marketing transactions. Its customer base includes Overstock.com (OSTK), Ancestry.com and Wayfair (W).
"
180,TSS,"""That was a technology-based acquisition,"" said Nathan Rozof, senior vice president of investor relations at Vantiv. ""Today, we're using that e-commerce technology to win clients like the USPS, where they need help processing not only in all their post offices but also USPS.com and the kiosks.""
"
181,TSS,"The other two acquisitions relate to the integrated payment space. Whenever a merchant, such as a restaurant, buys the software to manage its orders, inventory, kitchen, employee time and accounting, Vantiv can integrate the payment processing technology and offers 24/7 help lines for all platforms if any issues arise.
"
182,TSS,"Vantiv's purchase of Element in 2013 brought innovative technology into this integrated payment space, while the larger Mercury buyout in mid-2014 brought with it one of the largest distribution channels in the U.S.
"
183,TSS,"More Sales, Cybercrime
"
184,TSS,"The company is certainly benefiting from a positive secular trend. ""The macro backdrop has been a positive (for Vantiv), and the declining gas prices have helped fan its sales growth,"" said Jason Deleeuw, senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray. ""We think payment security at the small and midsize merchant level is a key driver of growth for the larger, more sophisticated merchant processors like Vantiv.""
"
185,TSS,"Vantiv also plans to use its large cash position to consider offshore acquisitions, grow its core business and return capital to shareholders.
"
186,TSS,"As with any business, there are risks. Analyst Johnson mentions integration risk of its acquisitions, pricing pressure from financial institutions, PIN-network transaction-fee declines and economic risk.
"
187,TSS,"But the company has ambitious plans to grow its market share. From its spinoff in 2009 to today, Vantiv has grown its U.S. payment transactions share from 13% to 18%. ""We intend to grow faster than the payments industry,"" said Rozof.The time when customers paid for their purchases by swiping their credit cards and signing a paper receipt is coming to an end. New cards with a microchip and PIN have made their inroads into the financial payments market. And October 2015 marks an important steppingstone in this transition.Payment processor Vantiv (VNTV) stands to benefit from this industrywide shift. The Ohio-based company operates on both sides of the same market: It provides a full suite of payment services to merchants on the one hand; and on the other, it produces the physical cards for financial institutions across the U.S.Thanks to its extensive distribution network and access to both large and small merchants, Vantiv is the second-largest merchant acquirer in the U.S., representing an 18% market share in total payment transactions, overtaking a unit of Bank of America (BAC) in 2014. First Data ranked at the top. Vantiv also ranks as the No. 1 U.S. merchant acquirer in PIN debit transactions. An acquirer is a bank or other institution that accepts card payments in the merchants' behalf.On the financial services side, Vantiv holds a 10% market share in the U.S., representing more than 1,400 banking and financial customers. ""It is the electronic middleman that enables and links electronically retailers and point-of-sale systems to the card brands and to the card-issuing institutions,"" said Raymond James analyst Wayne Johnson.Among its clients are Macy's (M), Office Depot (ODP), Kroger (KR), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), In-N-Out Burger, Wendy's (WEN), Comerica Bank (CMA) and Fifth Third Bank (FITB). More recent additions include Rabobank, Capital One Financial (COF) and the U.S. Postal Service.Among The Big ProcessorsThe company ranks fourth among 28 names in IBD's Finance-Credit Card-Payment Processing industry group. Other players in the group include Blackhawk Network (HAWK), Total System Services (TSS)and Heartland Payment Systems (HPY). The group itself is ranked No. 29 among IBD's 197 industries.Originally a spinoff from Fifth Third Bank, Vantiv loaded up on technology and additional distribution capabilities to conquer the fast-growing market of electronic payments.

Apart from its card processing services, the company will also cater to card production, fraud and risk management as well as customer service support.

The transaction also helped the company expand in the U.S. prepaid card industry. Moreover, in April 2016, it also acquired TransFirst, a major U.S. merchant solutions provider. Other such initiatives include purchasing the remaining 15% ownership of the Central Payment Joint Venture, the recent buyout of Cayan and acquiring iMobile, which aided the company to be a leader in the payment services market.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock have surged 44.67% in the past year, outperforming its industry’s growth of 38.18%. Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the financial transaction services industry might look into a few better-ranked stocks like Cardtronics PLC (CATM  -  Free Report), Mastercard Incorporated (MA  -  Free Report) and Global Payments Inc.

218,TSS,"A booming U.S. economy, low unemployment, wage gains, increase in retail spending paints a perfect  growth-boosting picture for Mastercard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report). Apart from a strong macro economy, the shift in payment habits from cash and checks to the usage of electronic channel and cards have greatly benefitted this stock.Following a solid first-quarter 2018, the company lifted its earnings guidance on the back of a flourishing U.S economy. It now expects year-over-year revenue growth in the high teens percentage, up from its previous expectations of mid-teens percentage.The company has performed extremely well for past several years with potential to carry on the momentum in the near future as well.Year to date, the stock has surged 33% compared with the industry’s rally of 18.8%. Why an Attractive Pick?Solid Rank & Growth Score: Mastercard sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a favorable Growth Score of B. Our research shows that stocks with an impressive Growth Score of A or B when combined with a bullish Zacks Rank of 1 or 2 offer solid growth opportunities. Thus, the company appears to be a compelling investment proposition at the moment.Northward Estimate Revisions: For the current year, 16 estimates have moved north over the past 60 days, reflecting analysts’ confidence in the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 bottom line has been revised 5% upward to $6.31. Also, for 2019 earnings, the consensus mark has been raised 4% to $7.28.Strong Earnings Growth Prospects: The company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.31 for 2018 earnings reflects a year-over-year surge of 37.8%. Moreover, the metric is projected to register 15.4% increase in 2019.Growth Drivers: A series of acquisitions made by the company in recent years should complement its organic growth.The company’s revenues witnessed an impressive CAGR of 11% during the 2012-2017 period. The same was up 31% in the first quarter. We believe that the company should retain its revenue momentum in the coming quarters, riding high on its strong market position and a profitable core business, which continues to be driven by new deals, renewed agreements and an expansion of service offerings.International markets (Asia-Pacific, Canada, Europe, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East) provide both growth and diversification benefits to Mastercard. These markets have potential to generate growth over the coming years, led by a shift toward card usage and higher consumer spending. Moreover, these markets remain less penetrated than U.S. markets.The company’s strong international business has led to an increase in cross-border volume growth for the past several quarters (21% in the first quarter of 2018, 13% in 2017, 12% in 2016) and we expect this trend to continue in the going ahead .The company’s consistent investment in technology also positions it well in a rapidly shifting payments space. It includes investment in Artificial intelligence, blockchain, tokenization, biometrics and much more.Strong Balance Sheet: Mastercard boasts a strong balance sheet with financial flexibility and a continuous cashflow from operating activities. Its disciplined capital management strategy by way of share buyback and dividend payments remains impressive. We believe the company will continue to generate favorable cash from operations owing to its expandingbusiness volumes. Its robust capital position enables it to pursue acquisitions, which have already ramped up its inorganic growth profile.Strong and Growing ROE: Mastercard’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) of 92% remains significantly higher than the industry’s 39% average. This, is turn, reinforces its growth potential. The figure also reflects the company’s tactical efficiency in using shareholders’ funds. Moreover, the company’s ROE has grown steadily over a period of five years.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther stocks worth considering from the space include WEX Inc. (WEX  -  Free Report), Evertec, Inc. (EVTC  -  Free Report) and Total System Services Inc. (TSS  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

231,TSS,"Cash is king. But when it comes to the payments’ ecosystem, cash is taking a back seat, given the twists in in the way money moves around the world.  Payments via plastic cards — credit, debit, charge and other cards have rapidly overtaken cash payments.Ease of carrying, safety against theft, payment flexibility, attractive rewards and a number of other features make plastic cards highly coveted. This is evident from the number of cards in circulation and the rapid growth in the amount transacted via these in last five years. Also, growing penchant among consumers for online shopping is giving a boost to the use of plastic.The dynamic payments’ space is transforming from plastic to electronic methods, thanks to emerging technologies. Widespread use of technology has filtered down to the financial services industry and has redefined the payments’ method from analogue to digital. Internet is now a way of life and electronic payment is preferred for money transfer.Alternative payment modes such as e-wallets, mobile and digital currencies have evolved and are gaining fast acceptance. Digital transactions are more attractive owing to cutting edge technology that provides greater transaction security, flexibility, accessibility, touchpoints, and speed, all at a lower cost. As a result, companies in this space are making huge investments to support the development of new and emerging technologies.Companies such as Visa, MasterCard, American Express and PayPal are constantly investing in upgrading technology to provide state-of-the-art services in an intensely competitive environment.Industry insiders also believe new markets will continue to be developed in areas that have been previously dominated by paper-based transactions. Continued development of new services and the emergence of new vertical markets will help in the growth of the payments’ industry.Also, the industry continues to grow worldwide and as a result, a number of large payment technology companies have expanded their operations globally by pursuing acquisitions and creating alliances and joint ventures.However, one major impediment to the growth of digital payments is the growing threat of cyber-attacks and data leakage. To address the hitch that these might lead to among consumers, organizations are regularly updating their software and fraud detection systems. At the same time, they educating their consumers on basic security features.Going forward, the up-and-coming tech-savvy generations, will fuel demand for innovative, technology-driven and easily integrated transaction methods.

The figure was also in line with the high end of management’s guidance range of 35-36 cents.The year-over-year decline was primarily due to lower non-GAAP revenues, which decreased 4.3% to $466.9 million, slightly better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

237,TSS,"Optimism of U.S. consumers is at levels not seen in more than a decade and a half. Record low unemployment levels, better-than-expected job addition, strong wage growth and growing GDP have pumped up the spending power of consumers with increased disposable income for discretionary purchases.Moreover, the relaxation of tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act should increase consumers’ propensity to spend more.These trends bode well for the payment and network processors whose revenue growth is directly proportional to the level of consumer spending.Buoyant U.S. EconomyRecent strong developments on various fronts like a decline in jobless claims, growth in consumer spending low unemployment and GDP  growth show that the U.S economy is on a strong footing.Per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 200,000 in January, and the unemployment rate was at a very low level of 4.1%. Employment continued to trend up in construction, food services and drinking places, health care and manufacturing.The strength of the U.S. labor market is evident from the most-recent Labor Department figures which showed that U.S. filings for unemployment benefits decreased by 10,000 to 210,000, the lowest since December 1969 (better than the estimation of 225,000).Strong Consumer Confidence Index ReadingThese positives further buoyed up The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index, which measures consumers attitude toward current and short-term economic conditions (next six months). The index rose to 130.80 in February, from 124.30 in January. Incidentally, this was the index's highest level since November 2000, when confidence hit 132.60.What underlines the surge in the index is consumers’ belief that the cadence of growth will continue. This optimism has led consumers to use their savings to make purchases. This surely is a welcome sign for payment and network companies, which are the end-beneficiaries of rising consumer spending.It is to be noted that growth in consumer spending was  3.8% in the fourth quarter of 2017. This was the quickest pace since the fourth quarter of 2014 and followed a 2.2% rise in the third quarter of 2017. Market participants believe that this strength in consumer spending is sustainable going forward.Network and Payment Processors Set to GainThe thriving economy should thus benefit payment and network processors as the increase in consumers spending boosts retail sales as payments are increasingly being made by card, online and contactless methods. This marks a departure from the traditional cash and checks, thanks to the rapid percolation of technology in everyday lives.  Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report) one of the major payment processors and network providers,disclosed that in its fiscal first quarter (October-December 2017), the payments volume from United States grew 10% driven by increases in consumer credit and holiday spending. Growth was driven by better performance in retail and entertainment (sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels) which include movies, gaming, fitness, sporting goods and recreational activities. Both offline and online volume had higher growth rates than the prior year with online growing approximately four times faster than offline.On its most-recent conference call, Visa disclosed that the 2017 holiday season was stronger than the prior year as both consumer credit and debit grew at higher levels. Also, ecommerce continued to gain share, jumping to over 30% of consumer U.S. holiday volume. Ecommerce growth was strong across a number of categories but was more significantly strengthened by retail performance.Another major company in the same space Mastercard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) said that U.S. consumer confidence was healthy, unemployment low and holiday retail sales solid in the fourth quarter of 2017. Its U.S. Gross Dollar Volume (GDV), (which measures the aggregate amount of purchases made with Mastercard’s branded cards) grew 9%, up 3% from last quarter, and comprised Credit and Debit growth of 10% and 8%, respectively.Some Attractive Stocks in This SpaceGiven the strong macro backdrop, investing in this space should yield attractive returns for your investment portfolio.  Based on certain parameters, we have zeroed in on four stocks with a Zacks Rank#1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). These stocks have seen an upward revision in earnings estimates and have outperformed the industry’s growth of 35% in a year’s time.  Mastercard is perfectly poised to grow from higher switched transactions, increase in cross-border volume and gross dollar volume as well as gains from acquisitions. Following strong performance in 2017, the company upped its long-term EPS guidance. It now expects 2016-2018 earnings per share CAGR to be approximately mid-20% from 20% earlier.

The trend continued in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 with revenues growing 9% year over year. For fiscal 2018, the company expects annual net revenue growth of high single digits on a nominal dollar basis, earnings per share (EPS) growth of mid-50s (versus mid-40s earlier) on a GAAP nominal dollar basis, and high end of mid-20s (high end of mid-teens) on an adjusted, non-GAAP basis.The stock has gained 36% in a year’s time. It has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings and 2019 being revised 7% and 8.7%, respectively, upward over the last 60 days.Total System Services Inc. (TSS  -  Free Report), with a Zacks Rank of 2, has witnessed a revenue CAGR of 27% from 2014 to 2017. The top line should see a further upside from a strong market position and attractive core business that continues to be driven by new deals, renewed agreements, accretive acquisitions and expansion of service offerings. The company expects net revenues of 2018 in the band of $3.65-$3.75 billion, up 7-10% year over year and adjusted EPS of $4.10-$4.20, reflecting a rise of 22-25% year over year.The stock has risen 62% in a year’s time.

238,TSS,"Investors had mixed reactions on Equifax Inc.’s (EFX  -  Free Report) latest quarterly results as depicted from yesterday’s late-hour trade. Following the company’s fourth-quarter 2017 results, the stock rose approximately 2.2% but finally closed after hour trading at less than 0.5%. The share price movement apparently reflects uncertainty and cautiousness among investors pertaining to the last year’s data breach incident. However, the credit bureau company’s revenues and non-GAAP earnings per share came ahead of the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.In September 2017, Equifax announced that very sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers has been stolen from its database. Thus, analysts and investors waited with bated breath for the credit information provider’s fourth-quarter results, wherein updates on the data breach and its implication on the finances of the company were expected.During the quarter, the company recorded $26.5 million of costs related to the data breach. Notably, in the third quarter it had incurred $87.5 million owing to the same.Despite incurring this huge cybersecurity expense, the company managed to record a year-over-year increase of 40.6% in GAAP earnings per share, courtesy of the latest Tax Cuts and Jobs Act benefit which lowered the effective tax rate. The company recorded a one-time tax benefit of $48.3 million due to the recent tax enactment. On a GAAP basis, Equifax reported earnings of $1.42 per share, up from $1.01 posted in the year-ago quarter.However, on non-GAAP basis (which excludes one-time items including the costs related to data breach and benefit from lower effective tax rate) the company’s non-GAAP earnings came at $1.39 per share, 3 cents lower than the earnings of $1.42 reported in fourth-quarter 2016. Here, it should be noted that the fall would have been much more, but the Securities & Exchange Commission‘s (“SEC”) rule of reporting financial results on non-GAAP basis gave it a scope to somewhat mitigate the debacle. Equifax’s non-GAAP earnings came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.35.Diverse opinion among investors following the company’s fourth-quarter results might have led to the volatility in yesterday’s late-hour trade. Furthermore, investors focus will be on the company’s fourth-quarter earnings conference call, which is scheduled to be held today before the market opens, for a better understanding of its growth prospects.Notably, the stock is on a downtrend since it reported the data-breach incident on Sep 8. It has lost 13.1% of its value since then, while the industry to which it belongs to has gained 19.1%.  Let’s discuss quarterly results in detail.RevenuesEquifax’s revenues of $838.5 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $825 million marking a year-over-year improvement of 4.7%. However, it should be noted that this was the second slowest growth rate in the last several quarters after the 3.8% it registered in third-quarter 2017.Lackluster top-line performance was mainly due to the dismal performance at its U.S. Information Solutions (USIS) division which suffered a year-over-year 1% decline in revenues to $313 million, highlighting the impact of the data-breach scandal. The division suffered revenue decline of 9% at Mortgage Solutions Services sub-segment, while sales at Online Information Solutions remained flat year over year and at Financial Marketing Services witnessed 1% increase.Revenues declined at Global Consumer Solutions and in turn dented overall sales growth. Revenues at this division plunged 2% year over year to $97.3 million.However, the company’s other segments continue to perform well.Revenues from the International division (including Europe, the Asia Pacific, Canada and Latin America) advanced 15% year over year to $244.8 million. On a constant-currency basis, revenues increased 12%. The company registered growth at every international region with revenues increasing 10%, 16%, 18% and 17% in Asia-Pacific, Latin America, Canada and Europe, respectively.Revenues from the Workforce Solutions segment climbed 6% year over year to $183.4 million, primarily on the back of 11% sales growth in Verification Services, partially offset by a 5% decline at Employer Services.Operating ResultsEquifax’s adjusted EBITDA remained flat year over year at $292 million. However, adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 170 basis points (bps) to 34.8%. Adjusted net income came in at $168.6 million or $1.39 per share compared with $172.4 million or $1.42 per share reported a year ago.Equifax, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Equifax, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Equifax, Inc. Quote Balance Sheet & Cash FlowEquifax exited the reported quarter with $336.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, up from the previous quarter’s balance of $315.4 million. Total long-term debt (excluding current portion) was $1.74 billion, down from $2.04 billion at the end of previous quarter. During the year ended Dec 31, 2017, Equifax generated cash flow of $816 million from operational activities.In 2017, the company paid dividend of $187.4 million. Also, Equifax’s board of directors yesterday approved a quarterly cash dividend of 39 cents to be payable on Mar 30 to shareholders of record date as of Mar 12. Notably, the company has a history of paying quarterly dividend for more than 100 years.Our TakeWe believe that due to ongoing uncertainty the company has not provided outlook for the forthcoming quarter. Therefore, we will have to wait for the company’s today’s conference call to have a clearer picture about its future prospects.Escalating expenses related to the cyber attack will remain a drag on the company’s profitability. We expect the company to incur more expenses in the form of legal and professional services associated with the data-breach incident. Further, its expenses might flare up due to increased investments in IT and security solutions as well as insurance services.The brand image and creditability of Equifax has been in question and is facing huge customer criticism, while cybersecurity companies are questioning its preparedness and response to the massive data breach. Moreover, with lawmakers and investigating agencies probing the mishap, its troubles are unlikely to end any time soon.We believe the entire issue may result in loss of customers and the company may also have to make huge compensation to clients. This is feared to have an adverse impact on the company’s financial performance in the near term.Currently, Equifax carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the same space are Envestnet, Inc. (ENV  -  Free Report), Global Payments Inc. (GPN  -  Free Report) and Total System Services Inc. (TSS  -  Free Report), all carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Envestnet, Global Payments and Total System Services have long-term expected growth rates of 15%, 15.8% and 14.6%, respectively.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more. Those gains, however, came with serious volatility and risk. Bitcoin sank 25% or more 3 times in 2017.Zacks has just released a new Special Report to help readers capitalize on the explosive profit potential of Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies with significantly less volatility than buying them directly.See 4 crypto-related stocks now >>

255,TSS,"Total System Services, Inc.’s (TSS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to announce first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, 2018 after the closing bell. Its quarterly revenues and earnings are expected to improve year over year.The company is expected to benefit from a healthy sales pipeline, sharp focus on expense control and a robust roster of issuing clients with long-term agreements.Last quarter, Total System’s earnings surpassed estimates by 5.1% led by strong contribution from each of its operating segments.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history, having surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 6.63%. This is depicted in the chart below:Total System Services, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Total System Services, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Total System Services, Inc. QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that chances of Total System beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate is high as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Total System is +0.51%.Zacks Rank: Total System has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsThe company’s NetSpend segment should deliver revenue growth from an increase in gross dollar volume and higher debit active cards. Contract extensions for several significant partnership agreements signed in the fourth quarter should drive the top line.  Some of these contracts were a one-year extension with Intuit for QuickBooks which offers NetSpend accounts to users of their accounting software, a two-year extension with Liberty Tax as well as a three and four-year, respective, contract extension with Advance America and Check `n Go. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenue from the segment is $202 million, up 2.5% year over year.The company’s Issuer Solutions segment should see top-line growth from an increase in Total Accounts on File (AoF), led by new business and internal growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total AoF is 812 million, reflecting an increase of 6.6% year over year. Focus on new product initiatives, technology modernization and integration activities will further aid revenues in the segment.On Jan 11, 2018, the company completed its acquisition of Cayan Holdings LLC. which became part of the Merchant Solutions segment. This deal will allow Total System to serve about 730,000 merchant sites with an annual processing volume of more than $138 billion, and will be only slightly accretive to the segment’s first-quarter earnings. This segment should report revenue growth from the acquisition of TransFirst (made in April 2016). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from this segment stands at $338 million, which translates into year-over-year growth of 29.5%.The company should incur a higher interest cost in the first quarter on account of debt taken to close the Cayan acquisition. Investments made to enhance the company’s infrastructure, longer-term product offerings and technological capabilities, should push up expenses and weigh on margins to some extent.Nevertheless, a decline in tax rate to the 21% to 23% range, down from the 32% to 33%, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will aid the company’s margins.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Mastercard Incorporated (MA  -  Free Report), is expected to report first-quarter 2018 earnings results on May 2.

Focus on new product initiatives, technology modernization and integration activities will further aid revenues in the segment.We also expect to see higher revenues from the company’s Netspend segment (acquired in 2013), which has been seeing revenue growth for many quarters in a row. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of this segment is $174 million, which reflects a year-over-year increase of 8.1%.We also expect the company to generate strong cash flow like it has been doing for the past many quarters.  Its bottom line will get an added boost from shares bought back during the quarter.Nevertheless, investments made to enhance the company’s infrastructure, longer-term product offerings and technological capabilities, should shoot up expenses and weigh on margins to some extent.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history, having surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four reported quarters, with an average positive surprise of 5.7%.Total System Services, Inc.

262,TSS,"The financial transaction service providers have reported a decent performance in the first nine months of 2017 backed by a thriving U.S. economy, lower unemployment, reduced inflation, healthy consumer confidence, which resulted in improved business volumes. Increased investment in information technology and growing demand for online payments significantly spurred transaction volume growth.Moreover, the recent tax reform policy that lowered corporate tax to 21% from 35%, although might result in one-time charge for some companies, is expected to benefit the players in the long term.The new European rules on online payments and banking, allowing retailers and consumers to bypass banks by authorizing payments directly from personal accounts, might result in reduced costs and enhanced scope of offering for the payment processors.  Factors Affecting Q4 ResultsEconomic growth in the United States has resulted in higher disposable income, leading to greater customer spending. This is expected to propel the companies’ transaction sales volume in the fourth quarter.The payment processors have also gained from alternative payment modes like e-wallets, electronic payments as well as cryptocurrencies that provide customers with greater transaction security, flexibility, accessibility, touch-points and speed, all at a lower cost. Huge investments in technology to meet the changing demand of customers have resulted in the development of new and emerging cutting-edge technologies.Another major attribute of the industry is inorganic growth.The payment processors have been consolidating through mergers and acquisitions, strategic alliances and partnerships to expand their operations globally.  However, international operations have exposed the players to foreign exchange volatility. The recent tax cut is also likely to result in one-time tax on the companies’ unrepatriated overseas earnings.Increased investment in technology, marketing and promotional activities as well as consolidation-related expenses have led to a continuous rise in operating costs. This is likely to put pressure on the bottom line in the fourth quarter.Industry Rank and Price PerformanceThe industry is booming, which is evident from its rally of 38.4% in a year compared with 21.4% gain registered by the S&P 500. Therefore, stocks in this industry are likely to generate fair returns over time.Stocks to ConsiderWe have zeroed in on four stocks from the industry that are poised for an earnings beat in fourth-quarter 2017.

263,TSS,"Investors often fail to think through sales growth as a dependable metric when it comes to picking winning stocks. This might be because of their preconceived notion that a company’s stock price is typically sensitive to its earnings momentum. However, betting on stocks completely depending on such a perception may not prove worthwhile.It’s worth keeping in mind that in cases when companies incur a loss, albeit transitorily, they are valued based on their revenues not earnings, as top-line growth (or decline) is usually an indicator of a company’s future earnings performance. In contrast with price to earnings and price to book value ratios, which can turn negative and cease to be relevant, the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is available even for firms that have hit choppy waters.Further, a company can improve earnings by resorting to cost control measures while maintaining stable revenues. But superior profits could be achieved through continued revenue growth.Also, earnings and book value are largely influenced by several factors including accounting decisions tied with depreciation, significant charges and inventory. However, management has limited opportunities to manipulate sales, which further underscores the importance of P/S ratio.A huge sales number does not necessarily convert into profits. Hence, considering a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be more prudent. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow lend a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments.Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the 15 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in St. Petersburg, FL, Raymond James Financial, Inc.

264,TSS,"Robert Half International Inc. (RHI  -  Free Report) has been steadily gaining from robust trends in the international hiring market. Moreover, improved labor market conditions in the United States have bolstered investor’s optimism in the stock. Consequently, shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company returned 14.1% in the past three months, compared with the industry’s rally of 13.3%.International Hiring Markets: A Vital Growth DriverRobert Half’s international revenues have been surging owing to rising demand for professional staffing services. This has been a persistent trend since the first quarter of 2014. Further, the company’s temporary staffing services have been on the rise globally, as employers are building flexible staffing options in human resources plans. The company has also been investing heavily in tapping the evolving prospects in the technology staffing area, over the past few years.Notably, international revenue growth, mainly from the European regions provided some cushion to Robert Half’s otherwise soft figures in third-quarter 2017. During the quarter, currency-neutral staffing revenues from international regions jumped 11% from the prior-year quarter. Also, international revenues grew 12% year on year in the Protiviti segment. Investing in TechnologyRobert Half has been utilizing a major share of its capital expenditures on investments in software initiatives and technology infrastructure. Important software initiatives include upgrades to enterprise resource planning applications and the implementation of a global, cloud-based customer relationship management application. Further, the company continues to invest in digital technology initiatives to enhance service offerings to clients and candidates. In this regard, Robert Half completed the global rollout of its CRM software in 2017, and also launched a website.Improving U.S Hiring MarketWhile Robert Half’s U.S. revenues were soft in the third quarter, management noted that hiring market trends started improving in September and continued till October. Evidently, temporary and consulting staffing revenues grew 2.1% in September and 2% in the first two weeks of October. Also, permanent placement revenues advanced 7.2% in September and surged 21% in the first three weeks of October.Moreover, the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are expected to create more jobs owing to its positive impacts on the economic conditions. The benefits from lower tax rates may propel companies to allocate more capital for increasing headcount to support business growth. Such factors can significantly bolster Robert Half’s hiring services in the forthcoming periods. Moreover, tax reforms are expected to aid the company in retaining profits and allocate more funds toward technological reformations and development efforts.Wrapping UpBacked by solid international and gradually improving U.S. hiring market trends, we expect Robert Half to continue on its growth path. Further, the company’s efforts to improve technology infrastructure is noteworthy and is expected to boost business in the forthcoming periods.     Looking For More?

265,TSS,"Shares of data and analytics solutions provider, TransUnion (TRU  -  Free Report) scaled a new 52-week high of $57.23 in yesterday’s trading session, before closing a tad lower at $56.68 for a solid one-year return of 77.1%. Barring minor hiccups, the company’s share price has steadily been on an uptrend since mid-September last year. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has the potential for further price appreciation with long-term earnings growth expectations of 10% and looks poised to touch new highs in 2018.Growth DriversTransUnion has an attractive business model with highly recurring and diversified revenue streams, significant operating leverage, low capital requirements and strong and stable cash flow. The company’s gigantic treasure trove of data is its most distinguishing asset and is perhaps the biggest barrier to entry for competitors. TransUnion has more than 30 petabytes of data, growing at an average of above 25% annually since 2010. Acquiring or building such data involves huge costs, making it extremely difficult for a new company to build the contacts and data that TransUnion already has. This fortifies its ability to sustain competitive advantage and protect its market share, enabling it to maintain a healthy growth momentum.TransUnion’s addressable market includes the burgeoning Big Data and analytics, which is expanding rapidly as companies comprehend the advantages of building an analytical enterprise where decisions are derived from data and insights. Numerous underlying trends are supporting this market growth, including the creation of massive amounts of data, advances in technology and analytics that allow data to be processed more swiftly and efficiently for key insights across industries and geographies.The inherent nature and significance of its solutions in customers’ decision-making endow it with high customer retention and revenue visibility. Impressively, it deals with the 10 largest U.S. banks, top five credit card issuers, the biggest 25 auto lenders and thousands of healthcare providers and federal, state and local government agencies. Also, the company makes significant investments to modernize its infrastructure and facilitate the seamless transition to the latest Big Data and analytics technologies. This enables TransUnion to expand its business and improve cost structure.Moreover, as emerging market economies continue to develop and mature, the company is well-positioned to gain from the associated favorable socio-economic trends. Additionally, increased risk of identity theft due to data breaches and higher consumer awareness about the importance and usage of their credit information are propelling the demand for TransUnion’s consumer solutions.With continued growth impetus and core focus, investors’ confidence is likely to be boosted and the share price is anticipated to hit new 52-week milestones every now and then in 2018.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the industry include On Assignment, Inc.

268,TSS,"The players in the Financial Transaction Services industry have performed decently so far this year driven by improvement in U.S. economy, low unemployment, reduced inflation, and healthy consumer confidence that resulted in increased business volumes.The industry is also witnessing a shift from cash payments to online transactions, thanks to increased proliferation of information technology. Other forms of payments via plastic cards — credit, debit, charge and other cards — have also rapidly overtaken cash payments. Ease of carrying, safety against theft, payment flexibility, attractive rewards and a number of other features of plastic cards continue to boost transaction volume growth.Changing Industry TrendsThe economic growth in the United States has resulted in higher disposable income, eventually leading to greater customer spending. Plastic is now preferred over paper and borrowings are chosen over savings.  This has significantly propelled the companies’ transaction sales volume. Continuing the trend, the last reported quarter also saw solid revenue growth.Alternative payment modes such as e-wallets, mobile and digital currencies are gaining fast acceptance among customers. Cutting-edge technology that provides greater transaction security, flexibility, accessibility, touch-points and speed, all at a lower cost, has made digital transactions more attractive. Inspired by this, players in this space are making huge investments to support the development of new and emerging technologies in order to drive consumer spending.Inorganic growth has been a major attribute of the industry. The players have been consolidating through mergers and acquisitions, and indulging in strategic alliances and partnerships in order to expand their operations. Recent acquisitions of NuData Security by Mastercard Inc (MA  -  Free Report) and Heartland Payments by Global Payments, Inc. (GPN  -  Free Report), investment by Visa Inc (V  -  Free Report) in Swedish company Klarna and many more such deals indicate rise in consolidation activity in the space, which is expected to aid top-line growth. However, inorganic expansion has resulted in vast international operations for the Financial Transaction Services players, exposing them to foreign exchange volatility.One major threat faced by the industry is growing incidents of cyber-attacks and data leakage.

270,TSS,"In the current market scenario with changing customer preferences and habits, evolving needs, demographic changes and an extremely competitive environment, maintaining steady sales growth is the key to survival for any business. Companies are always looking for ways to boost their marketing initiatives to drive sales.Revenues are often more closely monitored than earnings at the time of assessing the growth of a business. It’s worth keeping in mind that in cases when companies incur a loss, albeit transitorily, they are valued on their revenues, as top-line growth (or decline) is usually an indicator of a company’s future performance. Therefore, the Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio can turn out to be a suitable metric for stock valuation. It remains a key stock selection criteria keeping in mind that management usually has limited opportunities to tamper with revenues as they can with earnings. Thus, the P/S ratio is subject to lesser manipulation than the Price-to-Earnings ratio.  Sales growth in isolation is, however, not enough. Consideration of a company’s cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments.Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.

271,TSS,"On Nov 15, we issued an updated research report on Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (FIS  -  Free Report).  The company is benefiting from solid organic growth and evolving digital platforms like mobile banking. However, intense competition and high debt level keep us apprehensive.Fidelity National’s shares have gained 23.2% year to date, underperforming the industry’s rally of 33.6%.Also, the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 has been revised 2.8% upward in the last 30 days. Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The company has witnessed an impressive compound annual growth rate of 12.4% in the last five years (ended 2016) on the back of its strong market position and broad customer base. Also, its initiatives such as digitization encourage us. Further, Fidelity National expects organic revenues to grow 2-3% in 2017.Also, Fidelity National’s investments in mobile banking and innovative products such as PayNet and BuyWay are expected to offer significant growth opportunities for the long term.However, the company’s balance sheet seems leveraged. Despite its efforts to reduce the debt level, Fidelity National had outstanding debt of about $9.1 billion as of Sep 30, 2017. This is likely to restrict the company’s future expansion plans and mar profitability.Moreover, the company is exposed to significant competition from the new entrants along with the existing, well-experienced peers.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space are Western Union Company (WU  -  Free Report), Total System Services (TSS  -  Free Report) and Visa (V  -  Free Report).

272,TSS,"We believe that Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report) is a solid choice for investors seeking exposure in the thriving payments’ space. Among many other factors, the company’s investments in technology and global network, its robust brand name, and acquisition of Visa Europe bode well.In the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s earnings has increased 1.5% for fiscal 2018 and 0.9% for 2019 to $4.05 and $4.68, respectively. This reflects analysts’ optimism about its prospects. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).  Further, shares of Visa have rallied 42.8% this year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 34.7%. This impressive price performance reflects investors’ positive stance following the company’s strong fourth-quarter results and favorable outlook for 2018.Key aspects that make Visa an attractive investment option are:Strong Earnings Outlook – Visa provided guidance for fiscal 2018. It expects annual net revenue growth of high single digits on a nominal dollar basis, earnings per share (EPS) growth of mid-40s on a GAAP nominal dollar basis, and high end of mid-teens on an adjusted, non-GAAP basis (versus 23% growth in fiscal 2017). Operating margins are expected in the high 60% range (versus 65.4% in fiscal 2016 and 67.3% in fiscal 2017). Strong earnings guidance instills investors’ confidence in the company.Consistent Revenue Growth – Visa’s revenues have grown consistently over the past several years. It has witnessed a CAGR of 12.7% from 2008-2017. We strongly believe that the company will retain its revenue momentum in the coming quarters on the back of its strong market position and attractive core business that continue to drive up on new deals, renewed agreements, accretive acquisitions, increasing spending via cards, shift to digital form of payments and expansion of service offerings. The company expects annual net revenue growth of high single digits on a nominal dollar basis for fiscal 2018.Visa Europe Acquisition Delivering Strong Value – The company completed the acquisition of Visa Europe in June 2016. The company stands to gain a competitive edge from a robust business model and increased scale with the acquisition of Visa Europe as it projects Europe to be a $3.3-trillion payments’ market and a high growth region in the future. The deal has been accretive to the company, having contributed to its top line by bolstering payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions. The deal contributed to fiscal 2017 EPS by mid single digits and management expects an addition of high single digits to fiscal 2018 EPS.Strong Balance Sheet Position – Visa enjoys a solid cash and available-for-sale investment position along with strong free cash flow. Its free cash flow increased 11.2% in fiscal 2017. Management expects more than $9 billion in free cash flow in fiscal 2018 (pointing to growth of 5.9% year over year).  Its strong balance sheet enables it to make acquisitions and fund capital expenditure that should drive growth in the long run.Other Stocks to ConsiderA few other stocks in the same space sharing the Zacks Rank with Visa are Total System Services, Inc.

273,TSS,"Total System Services Inc. (TSS  -  Free Report) seems to be an attractive pick right now given its strong fundamentals and solid growth prospects.In the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s earnings has increased 1.5% for 2017 and 1.4% for 2018 to $3.33 and $3.62, respectively. This reflects analysts’ optimism about its prospects. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).  Further, shares of Total System have rallied 47.5% this year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 34.7%. This impressive price performance reflects investors’ positive stance following the company’s strong third-quarter results and subsequent guidance raise.Key aspects that make Total System an attractive investment option are:Guidance Raise: Following third-quarter results, the company raised its full-year revenue and earnings per share guidance. It now expects total revenues of $4.839 billion to $4.889 billion (versus the old guidance of $4.80 billion to $4.89 billion), reflecting an increase of 16% to 17% over 2016 and net revenues in the range of $3.345 billion to $3.395 billion ($3.31 billion to $3.39 billion old guidance), up 10% to 12% year over year. Adjusted EPS is guided at $3.29 to $3.35 ($3.22 to $3.30), reflecting an increase of 18% to 20% year over year.Revenue Strength: Total System’s revenues witnessed a compound annual growth rate of 26% in the last four years (2013-2016). The trend continued in the first nine months of 2017 with total revenues increasing nearly 20%.  Also, net revenues are expected to grow in the range of 10% to 12% in 2017.Earnings per Share Growth: Total System witnessed an average EPS growth of 17.8% from 2011-2016. The trend is expected to continue in the near term. The company’s adjusted earnings are projected in the range of 18% to 20% in 2017.Strong Capital Position: The company has a strong track of cash flows. Free cash flow grew 45% year over year in 2016, mainly driven by the TransFirst acquisition-related tax benefits. The same was up 22% year over year as of Sep 30, 2017. For 2017, the company expects free cash flow in the $610 million to $640 million range (up from the previous range of $600 million and $630 million). The company also remains committed to enhance shareholders’ value via disciplined capital management.Other Stocks to ConsiderA few other stocks in the same space sharing the Zacks Rank with Total System are Visa Inc.

Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

274,TSS,"Investor reaction to Equifax Inc.’s (EFX  -  Free Report) latest quarterly results were mixed as evident from yesterday’s late-hour trade. Following the company’s third-quarter 2017 results, the stock fell approximately 2.5%, then recovered and went up to nearly 1%. Finally, at the close of after-hour trading, it was down less than 1%.Analysts and investors were waiting for the credit information provider’s third-quarter results to have a better picture of the impact of the data breach incident on the company’s financial performance. Notably, this September, Equifax announced that very sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers has been stolen from its database.The company recorded $87.5 million of costs related to the data breach, which was the main reason behind the 27.5% decline in its third-quarter GAAP earnings. The company reported GAAP earnings of 79 cents, down from $1.09 posted in the year-ago quarter.Equifax stated that it is still not sure how much its bottom-line results have been impacted by the above-mentioned data breach. In its 10-Q filing with the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC), the company reported that over 240 class-action lawsuits have been filed against Equifax. It is currently facing probe from a number of investigating agencies and regulators.However, SEC’s rule of reporting financial results on a non-GAAP basis gave it a scope to overshadow the debacle. On non-GAAP basis (which excludes one-time items including the costs related to data breach), the company managed to report year-over-year earnings growth.Equifax’s non-GAAP earnings of $1.53 per share came in 6.3% higher than the year-ago quarter. Moreover, quarterly earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.49 and were toward the upper-end of management’s guidance rage of $1.50-$1.54 (midpoint: $1.52).It is quite possible that investors will have different opinions on the company’s bottom-line results, which may have resulted in such volatility during yesterday’s late-hour trade. Furthermore, it is possible that investors will be waiting for the third-quarter earnings conference call, which is scheduled to be held today before the market opens, for a better view on its growth prospects.Notably, the stock is on a downtrend since it reported the data-breach incident on Sep 8. It has lost 23.7% of its value since then, while the industry to which it belongs to has gained 6.4%.Let’s discuss quarterly results in detail.RevenuesEquifax’s top-line performance was also not impressive. Revenues of $834.8 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $847 million as well as management’s guided range of $853-$861 million. Although, the figure was up 3.8% on a year-over-year basis, it was the slowest growth rate in the last several quarters.Lackluster top-line performance was mainly due to the dismal performance at its U.S. Information Solutions (USIS) division which registered a year-over-year 3% decline in revenues to $307.7 million, reflecting a complete sign of impact from the data-breach scandal. The division witnessed revenue decline at all its sub-segments. Revenues from Online Information Solutions, Mortgage Solutions Services and Financial Marketing Services dropped 4%, 2% and 1%, respectively.However, the company’s other segments continue to perform well.Revenues from the International division (including Europe, the Asia Pacific, Canada and Latin America) advanced 12% year over year to $239.8 million. On a constant-currency basis, revenues increased 10%. Growth was mainly driven by the Veda Group acquisition, which increased the Asia-Pacific region’s contribution to revenues to $81.2 million, up 10% year over year. Moreover, revenues registered growth of 16%, 11% and 11% in Latin America, Canada and Europe, respectively.Revenues from the Workforce Solutions segment climbed 9% year over year to $186.4 million, primarily on the back of 13% revenue growth in Verification Services. Revenues from Employer Services remained flat year over year.Global Consumer Solutions contributed $100.9 million to total revenues. The figure was flat on a year-over-year basis.Operating ResultsEquifax’s adjusted EBITDA increased approximately 8.1% to $312.5 million. Adjusted operating EBITDA margin expanded 150 basis points (bps) to 37.4%. Adjusted net income came in at $185.9 million or $1.53 per share compared with $175.2 million or $1.44 per share reported a year ago.Equifax, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Equifax, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Equifax, Inc. QuoteBalance Sheet & Cash FlowEquifax exited the reported quarter with $315.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, down from the previous quarter’s balance of $403.9 million. Total long-term debt (excluding current portion) was $2.04 billion, flat quarter over quarter. During the nine-month period ended Sep 30, 2017, Equifax generated cash flow of $508.7 million from operational activities.In the first three quarters, the company paid dividend of $140.7 million. Also, Equifax’s board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of 39 cents to be payable on Dec 15 to shareholders of record date as of Nov 24. Notably, the company has a history of paying quarterly dividend for more than 100 years.Our TakeWe believe that due to ongoing uncertainty the company has not provided outlook for the forthcoming quarter. Therefore, we will have to wait for the company’s conference call today to have a clearer picture about its future prospects.Its escalating expenses related to the cyber attack will remain a drag on the company’s profitability. Also, per its 10-Q filing, the company expects to incur more expenses in the form of legal and professional services associated with the data-breach incident. Furthermore, it stated that its expenses might flare up due to increased investments in IT and security solutions as well as insurance services.The brand image and creditability of Equifax has been in question and is facing huge customer criticism, while cybersecurity companies are questioning its preparedness and response to the massive data breach. Moreover, with lawmakers and investigating agencies probing the mishap, its troubles are unlikely to end any time soon.We believe the entire issue may result in loss of customers and the company may also have to make huge compensation to its clients. This may have an adverse impact on the company’s financial performance in the near term.Currently, Equifax carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the same space include Envestnet, Inc. (ENV  -  Free Report), Global Payments Inc. (GPN  -  Free Report) and Total System Services Inc. (TSS  -  Free Report), all carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

In the environment where plastic is preferred over paper and borrowings are chosen over savings, economic growth has resulted in a steep rise in the companies’ card sales volume. This is expected to drive the industry’s top line in third-quarter 2017.Mergers and Acquisitions to Aid Revenue GrowthThe players in the space are gearing up for growth through mergers and acquisitions, alliances, deals and pacts. Recent acquisition of NuData Security by Mastercard Inc (MA  -  Free Report), Heartland Payments by Global Payments, Inc.

This exposes them to foreign exchange volatility. Moreover, the dollar index fell 2.66% in the third quarter, which will weigh on the margins.   Increased ExpensesWe also expect to see an increase in operating expenses led by higher marketing spend by players in order to woo more customers in a competitive industry.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 and  fiscal 2018 moved north by 1.8% and 1.5%, respectively.Given the positive estimate revisions and a bullish Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), we expect a decent upside for the stock in the near term.Visa’s share price performance also remains impressive. The stock has surged 35.1% year to date, outperforming the industry’s growth of 27% as well as the S&P 500’s 11.7% returns.Why is Visa an Attractive Pick?Strong Guidance: For fiscal 2017, Visa expects annual net revenue rise of 20%, much higher than 9% in fiscal 2016.  Adjusted earnings per share growth are projected to be 20% on a normal dollar basis compared with approximately 8% increase in fiscal 2016.Top-line Growth: Revenue growth remained impressive at Visa, reflected by its CAGR of 20% over the past five fiscal years (2012-2016). This increasing trend continued even in the first three quarters of fiscal 2017. The company should carry on with a solid revenue momentum, given its strong core business in developed regions as well as advancement opportunities in international and emerging markets with low penetration rates.Growth in Electronic Payments: In recent years, the shift within the global payment industry from paper-based forms of payment such as cash and checks toward electronic payment mode like debit-credit card transactions has created substantial opportunities for Visa’s business to flourish.Strong Balance Sheet Position: Visa debt/equity ratio is valued at 0.5 compared with the industry’s 0.6, thereby indicating relatively lower debt burden. Visa enjoys a solid cash and available-for-sale investment position along with consistent free cash flow. This provides an operating leverage to the balance sheet, apart from acquisition opportunities as well as scope for capital expenditure to drive long-term growth.Key PicksSome other stocks worth considering from the same space are Western Union Co.

287,TSS,"On Sep 14, the U.S. market’s broadest benchmark homed in on the crucial 2,500 mark during a relatively quiet session of trading. This was the second successive record close for the S&P 500, a feat matched by the two other primary gauges of market performance. Of course, underneath the cautious optimism, wariness about a near-term pullback continued to linger. However, analysts at independent broker LPL Financial believe that after a five-month streak of wins, the S&P 500 is on track to mop up further profits this month. Further, the index has nearly always gained in the one-year period immediately following this winning streak. This makes it imperative to pick up S&P 500 stocks, which have mopped up strong gains during this period.Third Strongest Bull Run for S&P 500The S&P 500 gained 0.1% on Sep 13, ending at 2,498.37, only marginally short of the 2,500 mark. Since March 2009, the index has gained a stunning 269%, eclipsing the 266% increase recorded during the Bull Run extending from 1949 to 1956. This increase makes the current Bull Run the third strongest ever recorded. These insights were revealed by data from Bloomberg and the S&P 500 Dow Jones Indices.Although the extent of these increases could raise selloff fears among investors, such alarm is unwarranted. But this is because this stretch of gains loses its luster when considering annualized returns. This measure comes in at only 17%, the fourth poorest when considering 13 such periods. The reason for such a dismal showing is not difficult to discover, of course. At eight and a half years, this is the second longest Bull Run of all time.Five-Month Stretch of Gains to Power Future IncreasesBut for March, when it lost 0.04%, the S&P 500 has now gained for five straight months in a row. In fact, the index has now gained for nine months out of the last 10. Taking total returns into account, which includes the impact of dividends, the index has increased every single month since October 2016.Even as a large swathe of investors worry about pricey valuations, this long streak of gains should serve to ease their fears. Analysts at LPL Financial have stated that such five month stretches of gains are usually followed by year over year increases nearly 96% of the time. The average increase recorded over this period stands at 13.2%. The S&P 500 had gained for five successive months during the period stretching from March to July last year. Between July 2016 and 2017, the index gained 13.7%.Considering a shorter time frame, the S&P 500 also increases over the month following such a winning streak, opines LPL Financial. Per the company’s data such gains have occurred 20 out of 25 times in the past. During the month immediately after a five-month winning stretch, the index has increased by an average level of 1.3%. Incidentally, the S&P 500 has already gained 1.1% till now this month.       Our ChoicesWith the S&P 500 lingering near the 2,500 mark, market naysayers are already raising the specter of a pullback. However, long term trends show that a five month winning streak is usually followed by strong year-over-year gains.Further, such a stretch of increases usually leads to gains in the month immediately following such a period. Picking S&P 500 stocks which have notched up strong gains during this period makes for a profitable option. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in.

291,TSS,"The global payments industry continues to undergo a dynamic change. Technology and innovation is shifting consumer habits and driving growth opportunities in ecommerce, mobile payments, block chain technology and digital currencies.Industry insiders expect demand for debit and credit cards and online payments to continue to surge in the years ahead, as the style of payments shift from cash and checks to plastic and electronic mode. An improving jobs market and low unemployment have set a positive trend in consumer spending by increasing the number or average purchase amount of transactions involving payment cards and devices. These shifts in macroeconomic factors bode well for the industry’s growth.Despite the increased adoption of digital payments, cash continues to be in the mainstream and still make up for nearly 85% of global transaction. This proves that the industry still remains underpenetrated and provides ample scope for long-term growth.Stocks Under ConsiderationThe two leading companies in this thriving industry are MasterCard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) and Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report).MasterCard is one of the world's largest payment solutions companies, processing transactions from more than 210 countries and territories and in more than 150 currencies. It commands a well-established brand name and extensive merchant-acceptance network.Visa on the other hand operates the world's largest retail electronic payments network, with more than 2.3 billion Visa-branded credit and debit cards in circulation globally. Both stocks have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).It will be interesting to note which stock is better positioned in terms of fundamentals.Some better-ranked players in the same space are Total System Services Inc. (TSS  -  Free Report) and Vantiv, Inc. . Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1Rank stocks here.Price PerformanceBoth MasterCard and Visa have surged 29.6% and 33.4%, respectively, year to date, significantly outpacing the industry’’s growth of 24.31%. Here, Visa remains an outperformer.ValuationCompared with the industry’s trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 8.5, Visa is underpriced with a reading of 8.2. Meanwhile, MasterCard seems too expensive with a trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 24.3. On this basis too, Visa seems worth buying.Dividend YieldMasterCard has a current dividend yield of 0.7% and a five-year growth rate of 66.2%, while Visa has a dividend yield of 0.6% and a five-year growth rate of 30.1%.Though both stocks have a dividend yield that is below the industry’s average of 0.9%, they are good at increasing their dividend. Comparatively, MasterCard has an edge over Visa here.Earnings Surprise HistoryConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history, both Visa and MasterCard have delivered earnings surprises over each of the prior four quarters. While MasterCard has an average earnings surprise of 6.2%, Visa stands out with an average earnings surprise of 8.4%.Earnings Estimate Revisions and Growth ProjectionsMasterCard has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 earnings being revised upward by 1.9% and 1.4%, respectively, over the last 60 days.On the other hand, the same for Visa has moved upward for 2017 and 2018 by 1.8% and 1.3%, respectively, over the same time frame.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MasterCard’s earnings per share is $4.37 and $5.06 for 2017 and 2018, respectively, reflecting year-over-year growth of 16% and 15.8%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Visa’s earnings per share is $3.42 and $3.98 for 2017 and 2018, respectively, reflecting year-over-year growth of 20.3% and 16.4%.Return on Equity (ROE)The ROE ratio reflects a company’s profitability. MasterCard’s return on equity of 74.9% has significantly outpaced the industry average of 34.5%. However, Visa’s return on equity of 31% underperformed the industry. This reflects MasterCard’s tactical efficiency in using shareholders’ funds.ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that Visa is poised better than MasterCard when considering valuation, price performance, earnings surprise history, earnings estimate revisions and growth projections. MasterCard wins on return on equity and dividend yield.The winner here would have to be Visa, which has better growth figures compared to MasterCard.<!--{cke_protected}{C}%3C!%2D%2Dtd%20%7Bborder%3A%201px%20solid%20%23ccc%3B%7Dbr%20%7Bmso-data-placement%3Asame-cell%3B%7D%2D%2D%3E-->4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye onTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

292,TSS,"Fiserv Inc. (FISV  -  Free Report) recently announced the launch of Instant Issue Advantage, a tablet solution that enhances in-branch issuance and activation of payment cards within a short span of time. As customers can immediately start using these cards, engagement and satisfaction levels are anticipated to improve.This is significant for banks as delay in card issuance as well as activation can result in customer loss. Customer retention has become a major concern for banks amid intense competition from fintechs and traditional retailers offering disruptive financial services.We believe that instant issuance and activations of cards can act as a differentiator in this regard. The instant service will help in establishing banks as the primary financial institutions as compared with the aforesaid organizations, whose offerings are primarily online based. They are also not well-equipped to issue instantly activated cards due to the regulatory and certification process and PCI compliance procedures.Moreover, per Fiserv, the Consumer Preferences research highlights the gap between people receiving their cards and activating them. Only 63% of consumers activated their debit card the day it arrived in the mail. This habit significantly hurts interchange revenues, which can be improved through in-branch issuance and activation.Additionally, Fiserv’s expertise in effectively addressing challenges – primarily fraud – which banks and financial institutions face in case of instantly issued cards is a game changer. The adoption of company’s solution will mitigate risks related to issuance and activation of instant cards.Expanding Product Portfolio: Key CatalystFiserv remains focused on expanding its product portfolio. The company recently launched Integrator Advance that offers multiple tools, including research-based segmentation, cross-sell intelligence, campaign management and reporting in a single platform. Broadcom Limited Price and Consensus  Broadcom Limited Price and Consensus | Broadcom Limited QuoteMoreover, the company commands a leading position in the financial and payment solutions business backed by a broad customer base and key contract wins. In the second quarter of 2017, the company added six DNA clients, four among which have over $1 billion in assets and expects to add at least 10 more in 2017.Fiserv’s digital banking solutions are gaining momentum among the banks and credit unions. Recently, DNA solution was selected by SEFCU, which is among the top 50 credit unions in the United States, with approximately $3.5 billion in assets and more than 350K members in communities across New York.Further, investment in digital-oriented technologies is likely to improve the company’s competitive position in the long haul.Zacks Rank & Key PicksFiserv carries a Zacks Rank #3 (hold). Total System Services (TSS  -  Free Report), Western Union (WU  -  Free Report) and Vantive , all carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) are some better-ranked stocks in the broader sector.

293,TSS,"Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) recently completed the acquisition of ID Watchdog in an all-cash deal. The company had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire ID Watchdog on Jun 16, 2017.Per the agreement, Equifax will pay approximately $63 million in cash, which translates to nearly 40 cents per share, to acquire all outstanding shares of ID Watchdog. The buyout is aimed to provide a boost to Equifax’s capabilities to serve customers better.Founded in 2005, ID Watchdog is one of the leading providers of identity theft protection and resolution services to the Employee Benefits marketplace. The acquisition is anticipated to further strengthen Equifax’s identity theft protection services and fortify its presence in the employee benefits space.According to Dann Adams, President of Global Consumer Solutions at Equifax, “""We are excited to have ID Watchdog's industry leading products become an important part of our organization."" Adams further added, ""Merging our Identity solutions and industry relationships will significantly increase the access, range, and depth of our employee benefits solutions.""Equifax is the world’s largest data management company which organizes and assimilates data related to more than 820 million customers, and 91 million businesses globally.The company has made strategic acquisitions to supplement its core business. In 2014, the company acquired TDX Group and Forseva, while it closed the Veda Group Limited buyout in first-quarter 2016.We believe that management’s efforts, such as strategic initiatives for product innovation, expansion of data assets through acquisitions and continuous share gains in North America, should act as tailwinds. Moreover, the company’s strong correlation with the consumer and financial markets, as well as exposure in the U.S. and Europe are likely to propel growth, moving ahead.However, we foresee the company’s investments in new initiatives to weigh on its upcoming quarterly earnings. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding IT spending and the strengthening U.S. dollar remain concerns.Moreover, increasing competition from the likes of Fiserv (FISV  -  Free Report), Automatic Data Processing Inc (ADP  -  Free Report) and Total System Services (TSS  -  Free Report) are other factors likely to affect earnings in the near term.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

296,TSS,"Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) reported mixed results for second-quarter 2017. The company’s adjusted earnings (excluding amortization expenses, Veda Group acquisition-related charges and other one-time items) per share from continuing operations of $1.60 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.57 and also jumped 11.9% year over year.On a GAAP basis, the company reported earnings of $1.36 per share, up from the year-ago quarter tally of $1.08 per share. The strong year-over-year bottom-line growth can primarily be attributed to solid top-line performance and stringent cost management, which was partially offset by a marginal increase in the number of total outstanding shares.Notably, the stock’s share movement has compared unfavorably with the industry in the past one-year period. Equifax returned 9.5% while the industry gained 22.6%.RevenuesEquifax’s revenues of $856.7 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $861 million as well as management’s guided range of $857–$862 million. However, the figure was up 6% on a year-over-year basis.According to Richard F. Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Equifax, ""Second quarter performance reflects outstanding execution by the team and the strength of our unique portfolio of businesses.""The company made slight changes in its reportable segments from first-quarter 2016. The U.S. Information Solutions (USIS) and Workforce Solutions remained unchanged, while Personal Solutions was renamed to Global Consumer Solutions.Segment wise, total USIS revenues were up 8% year over year to $331.9 million. Among its sub-segments, growth was recorded in Online Information Solutions (6%), Mortgage Solutions Services (10%) and Financial Marketing Services (15%).International revenues (including Europe, the Asia Pacific, Canada and Latin America) advanced 6% year over year to $231.4 million. On a constant-currency basis, revenues increased 10%. Growth was mainly driven by the Veda Group acquisition, which increased the Asia-Pacific region’s contribution to revenues to $76.5 million, up 6% year over year. Moreover, revenues registered an increase of 13%, 4% and 2% in Latin America, Canada and Europe, respectively.Revenues from the Workforce Solutions segment climbed 10% year over year to $194.5 million, primarily on the back of 19% revenue growth in Verification Services, which more-than offset 5% decline in Employer Services.Global Consumer Solutions contributed $98.9 million to total revenue, reflecting an 8% year-over-year decline. On a constant-currency basis, revenues dropped 7%.Operating ResultsEquifax’s adjusted EBITDA increased approximately 13% to $334.7 million. Consequently, adjusted operating EBITDA margin expanded 250 basis points (bps) to 39.1%. Adjusted net income came in at $194.8 million or $1.60 per share compared with $172.7 million or $1.43 per share reported a year ago.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowEquifax exited the quarter with $403.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, up from the previous quarter’s balance of $123.2 million. Total long-term debt (excluding current portion) was $2.04 billion, flat quarter over quarter. During six months ended Jun 30, 2017, Equifax generated cash flow of $329.1 million from operational activities. The company paid 39 cents per share as dividends in the second quarter.GuidanceFor the quarter, Equifax projects revenues in a range of $853–$861 million (mid-point: $857 million), while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $855 million. Adjusted earnings per share are projected to be between $1.50 and $1.54 (midpoint: $1.52). The earnings guidance range at its mid-point is slightly lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.53.Furthermore, Equifax updated full-year 2017 outlook. The company now expects revenues in the range of $3.395–$3.425 billion (previous guidance $3.375–$3.425 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.41 billion. Adjusted earnings per share are now anticipated to be between $6.02 and $6.10 (previous guidance $5.96 and $6.10). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $6.06.Our TakeEquifax posted mixed results for the second quarter. However, earnings and revenues both recorded year-over-year growth. The company also updated outlook for full-year 2017.We believe that management’s efforts, such as strategic initiatives for product innovation, expansion of data assets through acquisitions and continuous share gains in America, should act as tailwinds. Further, the company’s strong correlation with the consumer and financial markets, along with exposure in the U.S. and Europe are likely to propel growth, moving ahead.However, we expect the company’s investments in new initiatives to weigh on its upcoming quarterly earnings. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding IT spending and the strengthening U.S. dollar are concerns. Moreover, increasing competition from the likes of Fiserv (FISV  -  Free Report) and Total System Services (TSS  -  Free Report) are the other factors likely to affect earnings in the near term.Currently, Equifax carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better ranked-stock in the broader technology sector worth considering is Applied Optoelectronics, Inc.

Notably, YellowPepper is also expected to provide assistance in project management services, UX design and services for the development and delivery of mobile applications.Visa has always made strategic partnerships in order to maintain its competitive edge. It makes up for almost half of credit card payments and three-fourth of debit card payments, thereby dominating the global electronic payments market.Previously, the company had partnered with PayPal in Jul 2016 to deliver significant benefits for Visa's issuing financial institutions.
