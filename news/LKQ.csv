"
20,LKQ,"The group is doing so well that even members considered to be laggards are attracting attention.
"
21,LKQ,"Case in point: Monday's news that auto parts supplier Bridgestone will acquire Pep Boys — Manny, Moe & Jack (PBY) for about $835 million. Bridgestone will pay $15 a share in cash, a 23% premium over Pep Boys' Oct. 23 closing price. The deal is expected to close early in 2016.
"
22,LKQ,"Bridgestone paid the premium even though Pep Boys has underperformed for most of this decade. The company's annual revenue has barely budged over the last three years, and it hasn't grown annual earnings since 2011. The fact that Pep Boys brought such a rich buyout offer says a lot about how much auto parts retailers are valued right now, analysts say.
"
23,LKQ,"""It certainly signifies the health and strength of the industry when you see a company pay that much for Pep Boys, which historically has been a laggard in the industry,"" Sterne Agee CRT analyst Ali-Ahmad Faghri told IBD. Faghri follows several auto parts stocks, including O'Reilly and AutoZone, but not Pep Boys.
"
24,LKQ,"The industry's strength is the result of several dynamics, analysts say. One is the average age of cars on U.S. roads: a record 11.5 years, according to research firm IHS Automotive. Older cars require more of the replacement parts, maintenance and repair work that auto parts retailers provide.
"
25,LKQ,"The aging fleet has also put more vehicles on the road — a record 250 million, according to Bloomberg. More cars lead to higher demand for auto parts and services.
"
26,LKQ,"Lower gas prices have been a boon as well. When consumers pay less for gas, they have an incentive to drive more, which increases demand for parts and services.
"
27,LKQ,"""Miles driven has been a critical growth driver — we've seen a nice uptick there,"" Morningstar analyst Adam Fleck told IBD. ""Consumers are increasing their miles driven, which increases the wear and tear on cars.""
"
28,LKQ,"Do-It-For-Me Fuels Retailers
"
29,LKQ,"Meanwhile, a growing number of consumers are outsourcing maintenance and repair to auto parts retailers rather than doing it themselves. This Do-It-For-Me (DIFM) side of the business has provided an additional revenue stream for auto parts retailers, which used to rely almost exclusively on the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) market.
"
30,LKQ,"""We continue to see growth in the Do-It-For-Me market, which has been a major growth driver for these companies,"" Fleck said.
"
31,LKQ,"Finally, auto parts retailers — unlike most other retailers — have not been hurt by Amazon and other e-commerce sites. That's mainly because when someone needs an auto part, he or she doesn't like to wait around for it to arrive by mail.
"
32,LKQ,"""Given the focus of service and speed, online retailers like Amazon haven't disrupted the auto parts retailers,"" Faghri said.
"
33,LKQ,"These favorable trends have helped offset what is normally a headwind for auto parts retailers — rising vehicle sales.
"
34,LKQ,"U.S. auto sales climbed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 18.2 million in September, the highest rate in more than a decade.
"
35,LKQ,"September was particularly strong because it included the full Labor Day weekend. Some experts expect the pace to slow in October, though the annual rate should still be the highest since before the Great Recession.
"
36,LKQ,"Last week, auto industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive raised their forecasts for 2015 auto sales to 17.3 million vehicles from 17.2 million.
"
37,LKQ,"And while more new cars on the road previously translated into less demand for replacement parts and maintenance services, previous conditions no longer prevail.
"
38,LKQ,"One thing that's different these days: older cars aren't being sent to the graveyard just because their owners are buying new ones. Instead, owners are trading their old cars in or selling them.

111,LKQ,"The fast growth of tiny yet powerful media entertainment devices — the iPad and other tablet PCs and smartphones — apparently is enriching the coffers of the media industry. TV shows, movies and the like are nothing new. But the ordinary user's desire to watch his or her favorite show anytime, anywhere has created new streams of income for television…
"
112,LKQ,"Don't mistake $1.2 billion Fidelity Trend's approach as a growth-at-a-reasonable-price fund.Manager Dan Kelley prefers to describe his fund as looking for companies whose growth is underestimated by Wall Street analysts.Kelley favors three types of growth stocks:Stable earnings growers.Companies on a hot streak, with high sustainable growth for many years.Opportunistic growers, which have low valuations but are near a point when a catalyst sparks a growth spurt.Google (GOOG), Monsanto (MON) and Visa (V) are examples of stable growers. Michael Kors (KORS) is in his high sustainable growth bucket, as he puts it.  Manitowoc (MTW), new to the fund as of its latest disclosure, and United Technologies (UTX) are opportunistic growers.Those latter two stocks benefit from the rally in nonresidential construction, Kelley says. Manitowoc sells cranes and lifting equipment. United sells elevators and heating systems.Other holdings also sell into the construction space.  Ingersoll-Rand (IR) makes climate control systems. Wesco (WCC) distributes industrial and electrical construction, maintenance, repair and operating supplies. Vulcan Materials (VMC) makes construction aggregates.""Nonresidential construction tends to lag residential by 12 to 18 months, so this space is right in a sweet spot,"" Kelley said.The ongoing rebound in residential housing benefits materials and tools sellers. The fund held Lowes (LOW) and Home Depot (HD) as of its latest disclosure.""As home sales improve, people feel more comfortable adding or refurbishing rooms or taking care of deferred repairs in existing homes too,"" Kelley said.Kelley's CredentialsThose areas are familiar to Kelley. Before taking the reins of Trend in January last year, at various times he has served as research analyst covering REITs and homebuilder stocks as well as manager of Select Construction & Housing along with other duties. He now runs four portfolios in all.Another trend Kelley has played is refurbished auto parts. He owned LKQ (LKQ) as of his latest disclosure.""Insurers are looking to lower auto claims expenses, so they're utilizing more refurbished parts. LKQ owns junk and scrap yards, where they get parts refurbished and recertified,"" Kelley said.Barriers To EntryThe field has grown fast and has barriers to entry. ""They have a distribution network of hubs across the U.S. that can get parts to mechanics and repair shops,"" he said.The fund was up 6.86% this year going into Tuesday. Its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. averaged 7.63%. The S&P 500 was up 10.24%.Over the past three years the fund's average annual return is 11.33% vs. 9.19% for its peers and 11.29% for the big-cap bogey.The fund's first-quarter relative performance trailed the S&P 500 as many investors shifted into defensive names and stronger yield payers. Rather than make such moves, Kelley continued to pursue growth. ""I stuck to my philosophy and process,"" he said.Kelley trimmed Apple (AAPL) in recent months. Its margins have shrunk due to rivals offering similar products at lower prices, he notes.

136,LKQ,"It's not enough that LKQ Corp. outruns the competition in the U.S. and Britain.
"
137,LKQ,"Now the Chicago-based alternative car-parts distributor is beating a path to continental Europe.
"
138,LKQ,"LKQ's (LKQ) British invasion in October 2011 was finessed through the $347 million acquisition of Euro Car Parts, the leading aftermarket parts distributor in the U.K.
"
139,LKQ,"In LKQ's recent march to the Continent, it picked off Netherlands-based Sator Beheer, tops in its home country as well as Belgium, Luxembourg and Northern France. The $272 million buy closed May 1.
"
140,LKQ,"Sator's parts are used by more than 6,000 customers, served from 11 distribution centers.
"
141,LKQ,"""It's clearly a strategically significant acquisition,"" said LKQ spokesperson Joseph Boutross. ""It increases our European footprint and puts us on the continent.""
"
142,LKQ,"At the end of the second quarter, Europe accounted for 27% of the company's parts and services revenue, up from zero before its foray into Britain less than two years ago.
"
143,LKQ,"Sator almost surely won't be LKQ's last buy in Europe.
"
144,LKQ,"""Acquisitions are core to our story,"" Boutross said. ""The pipeline is robust. We have tremendous amount of runway in North America and Europe.""
"
145,LKQ,"LKQ, which stands for ""Like Kind Quality,"" has expanded its footprint in North America for years. In 2012, it acquired a record 30 outfits.
"
146,LKQ,"New Parts For Business
"
147,LKQ,"LKQ's biggest buy at $810 million remains 2007's Keystone Automotive Industries, which nearly doubled its revenue and added more than 160 distribution warehouses .
"
148,LKQ,"""They know how to make an acquisition and integrate it effectively and speedily,"" said Elliott Schlang, managing director of Great Lakes Review, an institutional research boutique.
"
149,LKQ,"Great Lakes Review likes to focus on ""best of class"" midsize companies in the Midwest. LKQ is one.
"
150,LKQ,"""They're 20 times the size of their nearest competitors. That alone gets our attention,"" Schlang said.
"
151,LKQ,"The market for alternative car parts in the U.S. is highly fragmented, with lots of mom-and-pop operators. Schlang says LKQ has 25% to 30% share of that market.
"
152,LKQ,"In North America, LKQ is largely involved in collision repair parts such as headlights, fenders and doors, followed by mechanical components such as recycled engines, transmissions and body assemblies.
"
153,LKQ,"That puts it in a different market than do-it-yourself auto retailers such as AutoZone (AZO) and O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), Schlang says.
"
154,LKQ,"Insurance companies typically pay for collision repairs and encourage repair shops to use some alternative parts to save money since they're 20% to 50% cheaper than original parts.
"
155,LKQ,"And since LKQ is the largest distributor, it often gets the business.
"
156,LKQ,"""It basically has an unmatched distribution network that reaches most major markets in the U.S. and Canada within the next day,"" Schlang said. ""Their network of warehouses around the country and their ability to deliver with their own fleet of trucks gives them a leg up over everybody else.""
"
157,LKQ,"LKQ has more than 3,500 trucks in North America to move parts from warehouses to repair shops.
"
158,LKQ,"Its close ties with insurance companies and repair shops spur sales.
"
159,LKQ,"""In North America, LKQ is building partnerships that make it easier for repair shops to source parts,"" said analyst Craig Kennison of Robert W. Baird, in an e-mail.
"
160,LKQ,"Inventory Goes Online
"
161,LKQ,"LKQ recently forged a new partnership with CCC Information Services, for example, which provides software connecting repair shops and insurance companies for looking up the cost of parts.
"
162,LKQ,"After checking the CCC One database, repair shops would phone LKQ or other suppliers for parts. Now they can order online straight from LKQ via the CCC One system.
"
163,LKQ,"Kennison expects LKQ inventory to be accessible to more than 4,000 repair shops through CCC One, resulting in higher demand.
"
164,LKQ,"LKQ is trying to replicate its business model in Europe.
"
165,LKQ,"""In Europe, LKQ is building its distribution footprint and partnership with the insurance industry to develop demand for collision parts, which is driving robust growth,"" Kennison said.
"
166,LKQ,"Unlike the U.S., LKQ's European business is more skewed to mechanical parts than parts for collision repairs. But that's changing as LKQ adds more collision-focused components to its network.
"
167,LKQ,"""LKQ is positioned to be a leading distributor of alternative parts in Europe as the market for less expensive parts takes off,"" Kennison noted.
"
168,LKQ,"Because collision repairs are paid mostly by insurance companies, LKQ's business hasn't been as susceptible to the ups and downs of the consumer economy.
"
169,LKQ,"""They've had 12 years of consistent growth right through the recession,"" Schlang said. ""The consistency is unbelievable.""
"
170,LKQ,"Earnings and revenue over the last four years have grown 23% a year on average. In the second quarter, revenue jumped 24% to $1.25 billion. Organic growth (excluding acquisitions) was up 13% for parts and services, with Europe accelerating 37.8% and North America 7.3%.
"
171,LKQ,"Earnings in the quarter rose 19% to 25 cents a share. LKQ stock jumped nearly 12% after the Aug. 1 report that gave new 2013 guidance.
"
172,LKQ,"Management raised the outlook, expecting organic revenue growth of 8.5% to 10.5% vs. 6.5% to 8.5% previously and EPS of $1.03 to $1.10, up from its earlier view of $1 to $1.09. LKQ earned 87 cents a share in 2012.

173,LKQ,"Besides Sator, it made six buys in the quarter of local or regional parts distributors in the U.S. and Canada.

Retail sales climbed 1.1% in September, above the 0.7% growth economists expected. The New York Federal Reserve's Empire State business conditions index — a regional manufacturing gauge — came in at -6.2 in October. That's up from September's -10.4, but the gauge now shows three straight negative readings.On Tuesday, existing home sales for September will be reported at 10 a.m. Eastern time. The Street's consensus expectation is 4.75 million, which would be a slight drop from August's 4.82 million. Existing home sales account for a larger share of the housing market than new homes and thus are a better trend indicator.

On Apr 24, PACCAR Inc. (PCAR  -  Free Report) and Harley-Davidson Inc. (HOG  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter earnings. Both the companies reported earnings beat for the quarter.Per the latest Earnings Preview, 87 companies from the S&P 500 category have already announced first-quarter results as of Apr 20, registering earnings and revenue beat ratios of 82.8% and 67.8%, respectively.However, on a year-over-year basis, the auto sector’s bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter is expected to record a decline of 9.6% while the top line is likely to fall 3.4%. However, the S&P 500 companies are estimated to record respective 18.3% and 7.7% year-over-year rise in earnings and revenues during the quarter.An improved economy and shift in consumer preferences toward trucks and sports utility vehicles (SUV) encouraged automakers to launch new models in the U.S. market with an aim to earn their share of profit. In Europe, automakers are witnessing a decline in vehicle sales. Per European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association, vehicle registrations edged down 0.6% in first-quarter 2018. This decline is majorly due to slowing economic growth and uncertain trading regulations, once U.K. pulls itself out of European Union.Now, let’s evaluate how the four auto companies namely General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report), BorgWarner Inc. (BWA  -  Free Report), LKQ Corporation (LKQ  -  Free Report) and Lear Corporation (LEA  -  Free Report) are placed ahead of reporting quarterly figures on Apr 26.We relied on the proven Zacks quantitative model, combining a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) with a positive Earnings ESP, to predict the chances of earnings beat this quarter.

Our research shows that with an ideal combination of the two key ingredients — Zacks Rank and ESP — chances of a positive surprise are as high as 70% for the stocks, which are lined up for an earnings release.Detroit, MI-based General Motors offers a complete range of vehicles to cater to the needs of customers. Its products range from electric cars to heavy-duty full-size trucks. The company offers products under eight distinctive automotive brands namely, Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, Cadillac, Holden, Baojun, Wuling, and Jiefang. Our model does not predict that the company, with an Earnings ESP of -2.21% and a Zacks Rank #3, is likely to beat on earnings as the combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.In the last reported quarter, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. It also beat estimates in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 18.4%. General Motors has long-term earnings growth rate of 8.4%.

268,LKQ,"LKQ Corporation (LKQ  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 and full-year results before the opening bell on Feb 22.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 7.14%. Per its earnings record, the company missed estimates in only one of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 0.8%.In the last six months, shares of LKQ Corp have outperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has rallied 22.6% compared with the industry’s 12.2% rise.LKQ Corporation Price and EPS Surprise LKQ Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | LKQ Corporation Quote Let’s see, how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.Factors Influencing This QuarterFor 2017, LKQ Corp anticipates organic revenue growth of 4-4.5% for parts & services while the metric was 4.8% in the prior year. Also, the company projects adjusted earnings per share in the band of $1.86-$1.92 in comparison to $1.8 in 2016.In December 2017, LKQ Corp announced its plan to acquire Stahlgruber GmbH for an enterprise value of approximately €1.5 billion from Stahlgruber Otto Gruber AG. The acquisition is likely to fortify its presence in the Pan-European aftermarket as a parts distributor and might also assist the company to expand worldwide. However, this move is anticipated to weigh on LKQ Corp’s already ailing gross margin figure.The buyouts of Rhiag-Inter Auto Parts Italia S.p.A and Pittsburgh Glass Works enabled LKQ Corp to enhance its market potential as well as get cost synergy benefits. Later, the company completed the acquisition of Andrew Page business. These acquisitions lowered LKQ Corp’s gross margin to historical lows.The company is also witnessing a continuous rise in Selling, General and Administrative expenses (SG&A), which includes fluctuating prices of fuel, scrap metal and other commodities. Further, for 2017, it expects capital expenditure within the $175-$200 million range.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that LKQ Corp is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: LKQ Corp has an Earnings ESP of -1.85% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 41 cents and 42 cents, respectively. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: LKQ Corp sports a Zacks Rank of 1, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a company needs a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Hence, this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive. We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few stocks worth considering as per our model, these comprise the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat this time around:Ferroglobe PLC (GSM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +61.77% and a Zacks Rank #3.

The stock has gained 17.4%, compared with the industry’s 10.1% rally.Genuine Parts Company Price and EPS Surprise Genuine Parts Company Price and EPS Surprise | Genuine Parts Company QuoteLet’s see, how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.Factors Influencing This QuarterIn fiscal 2017, Genuine Parts anticipates its annual sales growth rate in the range of 4-4.5%, while adjusted earnings per share on a diluted basis is anticipated to be in the range of $4.55-$4.6.The company frequently undertakes acquisitions to expand its business. In November 2017, it completed the acquisition of Europe's Alliance Automotive Group (AAG) for a total price of roughly $2 billion. The acquisition will enable Genuine Parts to enter the European market through AAG’s large chain of stores and its geographical presence across the continent.Further, to boost top and bottom-line growth, the company is focusing to expand its product line to penetrate new markets.However, the company’s rising Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses, due to rising cost of labor and delivery as well as ongoing planned IT spending, are hampering its profit margins. Also, its high proportion of inventory might affect the short-term liquidity of the company during low sales.For the soon-to-be-released quarterly results, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales of the Automotive segment is pegged at $2.21 billion, up from the third quarter’s actual total revenues of $2.17 billion.Similarly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales of the company’s Industrial segment is pegged at $1.18 billion, up from the third quarter’s actual figure of $1.24 billion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales of Office Products segment stands at $473 million, up from the third quarter’s actual net sales of $510 million. While the same for net sales in the Electrical/Electronic Materials segment is pegged at $190 million, down from the third quarter’s actual net sales of $199 million.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Genuine Parts is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Genuine Parts has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.09. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Genuine Parts carries a Zacks Rank of 2, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

280,LKQ,"With several companies releasing their quarterly results in a row, a few automakers, namely Harley-Davidson, Inc. (HOG  -  Free Report), General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) and PACCAR, Inc. (PCAR  -  Free Report) also recently reported third-quarter figures. While Harley-Davidson’s earnings per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, both General Motors’ and PACCAR’s bottom lines beat the estimates.Three important auto and parts manufacturers, expected to come up with their earnings numbers on Oct 26 are, Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report), LKQ Corporation (LKQ  -  Free Report) and BorgWarner Inc. (BWA  -  Free Report).As of Oct 18, per the latest Earnings Outlook, 52 S&P 500 members have already revealed their quarterly earnings results. Of these companies, the beat ratios of earnings and revenues are 76.9% and 73.1%, respectively. From the Auto sector, 10% has reported quarterly earnings figures.For third-quarter 2017, earnings and revenue growth for the auto companies is expected to be more on the negative side. The sector is expected to record 17.4% and 5.6% year-over-year decline in earnings and revenues, respectively. However, companies under the S&P 500 category will come up with 3% and 4.9% year-over-year growth in earnings and revenues, respectively.In order to tackle air pollution problems, many countries are focusing on use of electric cars. This new paradigm shift has prompted many automakers to transfer their attention from gasoline and diesel-automobiles to electric cars. With this move, the companies have to balance current strategies as well as invest in future industrial trends and changes.Let’s take a look at the three auto companies, scheduled to announce results on Oct 26.We relied on the Zacks methodology, combining a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) with a positive Earnings ESP, to predict the chances of an earnings beat this quarter. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Per our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Research shows that with this ideal combination of two key ingredients — Zacks Rank and ESP — chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70% for the stocks lined up for an earnings announcement.A multinational automaker, headquartered in Dearborn, MI, Ford manufactures and distributes automobiles in 200 markets across six continents. Our model predicts that the company is not likely to deliver an earnings beat as it currently has an Earnings ESP of -9.43% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Therefore, we caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.In 2017, the company expects the adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.65-$1.85. Also, the company’s frequent vehicle recalls to fix safety issues is increasing the capital expenditure.

Our model does not conclusively predict that the company is likely to beat estimates this quarter as it currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. Although the bullish rank increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s 0.00% ESP however, makes surprise prediction difficult.The company expects organic sales growth in the 4-5.25% range compared with the earlier guided range of 4-6%, in 2017. This is majorly due to the acquisition of Andrew Page that is affecting its gross margin. However, its effort to lower the operational costs as well as the capital expenditure within $200-$225 million range might drive its results.

Currently, the company carries an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #2. Our model does not conclusively predict that the company is likely to deliver a positive earnings surprise this quarter.In third-quarter 2017, the company expects earnings per share to be within the range of 84-87 cents, higher than 78 cents in the year-ago period. Organic net sales growth for the quarter is projected in the 3-6% band. (Read more: BorgWarner to Report Q3 Earnings: What's in Store?)BorgWarner Inc. Price and EPS Surprise BorgWarner Inc.

In second-quarter 2017, it acquired a total of seven companies. Additionally, it is opening new branches of its subsidiary, Euro Car Parts Holdings, for counter sales and distribution centers in Europe.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that LKQ Corp. is likely to beat estimates this quarter.
